students, and practitioners. Accordingly, the materials have been presented to generate interest and 
curiosity and to provide knowledge about the current state of the practice and state of the art prin￾ciples and practice in pavement engineering. 
In general, there is a great interest in resilience and sustainability of pavements all over the world. 
The reduction of carbon in the life cycle of pavements and construction roads that can withstand 
the extremes of weather have become two of the most critical challenges for pavement engineers. 
Relying on the basic principles, several new concepts and technologies have been developed in this 
area, and research continues in earnest in different parts of the world. 
In this edition the authors have focused on incorporating new topics related to material char￾acterization, sustainability, and resilience of pavements. New information, data, and discussions 
on the basis of an extensive review of the literature, state of the art reviews, and Federal Highway 
Administration materials have been presented. Extensive references to web-based information have

1 Introduction and Description 
of Pavements 
1.1 IMPORTANCE 
Pavements are an essential part of our life. We use them as roads, runways, parking lots, and drive￾ways. Pavements are engineered structures and are important for our everyday life, commerce and 
trade, and defense. Surface transportation is the most widely used mode of transportation in the 
world, and a country’s development is often measured in terms of its total paved road mileage. The 
construction of roads is and will continue to be a major industry in developing countries, and as the 
infrastructure matures, it will be a major industry in developed countries as well. 
Like any other engineered structure, pavements are expected to be adequately strong and durable 
for their design life. They are expected to function properly by providing a smooth traveling surface 
for the traffc under various conditions of the environment. In order to ensure this, pavements must 
be designed, constructed, maintained, and managed properly. 
Pavements can be broadly classifed into asphalt (or fexible) and concrete (or rigid) pavements 
(Figure 1.1). Pavements consist of different layers, more so in the case of asphalt pavements than 
concrete ones. From the bottom up, these layers are known as the subgrade, subbase, base, and 
binder and/or surface. There are certain pavements with asphalt surface layers on top of concrete 
layers. 
In the United States there are about 4 million miles of roads, of which approximately 2.5 million 
are paved. The federal government and state departments of transportation (DOTs) spend a signif￾cant portion of their budget on maintaining and managing existing pavements and rehabilitating 
old pavements. More than 90% of commodities are transported on highways in the United States. 
Roads in poor condition end up costing the DOTs a signifcant amount of money for repairs, as well 
as costing the users money for damaged vehicles repairs. These roads are also unsafe for travel—for 
example, more than 30% of traffc fatalities have been reportedly due to poor road conditions. 
1.2 FUNCTIONS 
The most important function of the pavement is to withstand the load applied from a vehicle, such as 
a truck or an aircraft, without deforming excessively. The layered structure of the pavement is meant 
to ensure that the load is spread out below the tire such that the resultant stress at the bottom layer of 
the pavement, the subgrade, is low enough not to cause damage. The most signifcant load applied 
to a pavement surface comes from a truck or an aircraft tire. The approach in a fexible pavement 
is to spread the load in such a way that the stress at the subgrade soil level is small enough so that 
it can sustain the stress without any major deformation. When the existing soil is not stiff enough 
to support the relatively small stress, then there is a need to improve the soil. There is also a need 
to improve the soil if it is susceptible to moisture. Such a problem can be solved by treating the soil 
with an additive such as lime and Portland cement. 
Since pavements are exposed to the environment, a very important factor in the design of pave￾ments is the consideration of water, which could be coming from rain/snow (surface water) and/or 
from the ground (ground/subsurface water). Since water can be detrimental to a pavement, a basic 
necessity of designing a proper pavement is to provide adequate drainage for both surface and 
subsurface water. Standing water on a pavement can cause hydroplaning, skidding, and accidents. 
There is a need to make sure that water from precipitation is drained away quickly and effectively 
ISTUDY2 Pavement Engineering

Chapter, Duluth, GA.) 
and that there are no depressions on the roads to collect water. Water present in frost-susceptible 
soils in the subgrade can freeze causing heaving and failure of the pavement. Therefore, frost-sus￾ceptible materials should be avoided. If this is not possible, then the pavement structure above the 
subgrade should be thick enough to prevent the freezing front from reaching the frost-susceptible 
soil. Similarly, as one expects some water to make its way through random cracks and joints, proper 
subsurface drainage must be provided, and the material within the pavement structure should be 
made resistant to the actions of water—otherwise the aggregates, for example, would be washed 
away due to repeated traffc-induced pressure or freeze-thaw pressures. 
In most cases, it is not possible to completely avoid water fowing inside a pavement. Such ingress 
of water can physically remove materials from inside a pavement structure and also freeze and cause 
deformations in the pavement. To prevent this, the pavement material must be selected properly and, 
if needed, modifed. 
1.3 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION 
Generally the layers in a pavement improve in quality as one goes up from the bottom to the 
surface layer. The surface layer, which can be asphalt or concrete, is the most expensive and stiff/ 
durable layer in the entire pavement structure. Components of this layer are mostly naturally 
occurring materials; for example, asphalt binder is a by-product of the petroleum distillation pro￾cess, and aggregates are obtained from rock quarries or riverbeds. These materials are combined 
and used in different proportions to produce the fnal material that is used in the pavement. For 
example, asphalt binder is mixed with aggregates to produce hot mix asphalt (HMA) for asphalt 
pavements, while Portland cement is mixed with aggregates in Portland cement concrete (PCC) 
pavements. In both cases, the mixing must be conducted in the correct proportions to ensure 
adequate quality of the mixture. It is important to fnd out whether the resultant mix has the 
adequate strength and stiffness through testing. Such testing is generally conducted in the labora￾tory during the mix design process. During this process, loading and effects of environmental 
conditions can be simulated in the laboratory. If the responses to the testing do not meet our 
expectations, then the mix needs to be redesigned and/or the materials need to be reselected. 
These expectations are specifcations that have been developed on the basis of experience and 
research. State DOTs, USDOT (www.transportation.gov/), the Federal Highway Administration 
(www.fhwa.dot.gov/), or agencies can use their own specifcations and/or use specifcations from 
organizations such as the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Offcials 
(AASHTO; www.transportation.org/) or the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA; www.faa. 
gov/). Similarly, testing is also conducted according to standards, which again can be from the 
ISTUDYIntroduction and Description of Pavements 3 
state DOTs or the AASHTO. Whether or not the material can be placed and compacted is also 
determined during the mix design process. 
In most cases, pavement engineers are restricted to using locally available materials, with or 
without some modifcations, because of economic and practical reasons. With these available mate￾rials it is important to determine what thickness of each layer, and hence the entire pavement, is 
required to carry the loads under different environmental conditions without any problem. This 
step, known as the structural design, makes sure that the pavement structure as a whole can with￾stand traffc for its design life even though the traffc might increase and the properties of the layer 
might change cyclically and/or progressively during its design life. 
Generally several layers are present in an asphalt pavement. From the bottom up, the layers are 
known as the subgrade, subbase, base, and binder and/or surface. Generally, the bottommost layer is 
soil; the subbase and/or base layers can be granular soil, aggregates, or asphalt-aggregate mixtures 
(mixes); the binder and surface are asphalt mixes. While designing, an adequate thickness to each 
layer is assigned so as to obtain the desirable properties in the most cost-effective way. Concrete 
pavements may not have as many layers, and in many cases the concrete slab rests on a stabilized 
subgrade, which consists of soils modifed with some additives. 
Once the pavement materials/mix and structure are designed, it must be constructed properly. To 
ensure this, the material must be laid down and cured (if needed) and compacted in the proper way 
so that it has the desirable qualities, such as density and/or stiffness. While selecting the materials 
and designing the mix and the structure, it is important to keep workability in consideration since 
the best-designed mix would be worthless if it cannot be constructed properly. Furthermore, quality 
control must be carried out during construction to ensure strict adherence to specifcation and hence 
uniformly good quality over the entire project duration. 
1.4 MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION 
Starting from day one after construction, a pavement starts deteriorating in quality. Even 
though a properly designed and constructed pavement will not deteriorate so as to cause total 
failure within its design life, if no maintenance is performed the entire pavement will become 
totally worthless at the end of its design life. Furthermore, ingress of water through random 
openings, such as surface cracks, and well-defned openings, such as joints, can lead to quick 
deterioration of the quality of the pavement. The best approach is to regularly perform mainte￾nance operations, similar to any engineered structure or product, through actions such as joint 
flling, crack repair or flling, or pothole patching. Note that these operations do not specifcally 
increase the design life but do prevent its rapid deterioration. For pavements such as those on 
highways and airport runways, proper maintenance is critical for the safety of the vehicles and 
their occupants. 
In most cases, once built, a pavement can be “recycled” at the end of its design life almost inf￾nite times by reusing the existing materials solely or in combination with new materials. Off-course 
rehabilitation of pavements is a costly process. Hence, for any pavement network, a proper inventory 
of the condition of different pavements must be kept and utilized effectively to determine the time/ 
order in which the different pavement sections should be rehabilitated. This is important for two 
reasons. First, there is never enough funding for the rehabilitation of all of the roads in a network 
at the same time; second, different roads deteriorate at different rates and hence are in different 
conditions at a specifc time. It is important to “catch” the pavement at the most “appropriate” condi￾tion such that the rehabilitation can be done economically—a totally damaged pavement will need 
too much money to rehabilitate/replace it. This process of keeping an inventory of condition and 
selecting pavements for rehabilitation/reconstruction is called pavement management. This step 
includes the use of tools for determining the condition of existing pavements. The fastest growing 
method of such detection is nondestructive testing and evaluation (NDT and NDE). One example of 
a widely used form of NDT is the Falling Weight Defectometer (FWD) that works on the principle 
ISTUDY4 Pavement Engineering 
of evaluating defections of pavements under known loads and making an assessment of the struc￾ture and the condition of the pavement. 
1.5 IMPORTANT ISSUES 
Traffc keeps on increasing while the costs of materials and methods keep on climbing, and budgets 
are dwindle everywhere. At the same time, we are becoming increasingly aware of the detrimental 
impacts of many of the unavoidable factors involved in the road construction processes (such as 
emissions). The only way to keep up and still have good roads is through learning and applying 
good principles, implementing proven new concepts and technologies that would make roads more 
durable and sustainable, and continually researching better materials and methods. 
Therefore, the important issues can be summarized as follows: 
1. Drainage is needed to drain water quickly and effectively away from the pavement. 
2. The materials must be evaluated and selected properly so that they can withstand the 
effects of the traffc and the environment. 
3. The mix must be designed properly such that it can withstand traffc and environmental 
factors. 
4. The structure should be designed properly such that it has an adequate thickness to resist 
excessive deformation under traffc and under different environmental conditions. 
5. The pavement must be constructed properly such that it has desirable qualities. 
6. The pavement must be maintained/managed properly through periodic work, regular test￾ing, and timely rehabilitation. 
7. Sustainable technologies must be continuously incorporated in the road construction 
process. 
8. Generation of knowledge through research is critical for ensuring good pavements in the 
future. 
This book aims to provide the relevant principles and practical concepts of pavement engineering 
for both students and currently practicing engineers. 
1.6 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
A pavement’s primary purpose is to provide a functional surface for a specifc transportation need. 
The basic function is to withstand load under different seasonal environmental conditions without 
deforming or cracking because either of these distress conditions would reduce the functionality 
of the pavement. The function of the different layers in the pavement is to spread out the load on 
the surface and reduce its intensity with depth such that the pressure on the subgrade is much less 
than the pressure on the surface and can be tolerated by the subgrade without undergoing excessive 
deformation. 
A pavement consisting of asphalt mixes (and aggregate and soil layers) only is referred to as a 
fexible pavement since the pavement layers defect under a traffc load. The typically applied con￾cept of a fexible (or asphalt) pavement is that a layered structure (Figure 1.2) with better materials 
near the top would distribute the load in such a way that the resulting stress in the bottommost layer 
will be small enough so as to cause no signifcant deformation of the layer. The bottommost layer is 
the existing layer or the existing layer modifed with some materials. The materials and the thick￾nesses of the different layers will be able to withstand the different effects of temperature and mois￾ture due to changes in seasons in a specifc location. The subbase, in addition to providing structural 
support, may also serve as a platform for constructing the base and prevent the fne materials from 
the subgrade from contaminating the base layer. If the subgrade is of frost-susceptible material, then 
the subbase could be made up of non-frost-susceptible materials to prevent frost-related damage.

Rigid (or concrete) pavements, which defect very little under traffc loads, behave differently 
than fexible pavements under loads. The wearing layer, which is in contact with the traffc, is a 
Portland cement concrete slab that generally ranges in thickness between 5 and 12 in. depending 
on traffc loading. The thicker pavements are typical of heavier and more repetitive loads. The slab, 
due to its higher stiffness as characterized by elastic modulus, usually distributes the loading across 
a large pavement area. This, in turn, reduces the stresses experienced by the underlying base and 
subgrade layers. Rigid pavements may or may not have a base or subbase layer and could be placed 
directly over the subgrade. However, in high-performance pavements, a base or subbase is typically 
included (Figure 1.3). Besides providing a wearing course and a contact surface with traffc, the slab 
provides friction, drainage, smoothness, noise control, and waterproofng for the underlying layers. 
1.7 TYPES AND USES OF PAVEMENTS 
Under the broad defnition, there exist several different types of pavements with specifc functions. 
Let us review the more important types. 
1. Pavement for roads: There are different types of roads ranging from high-traffc-volume 
interstate highways to low-traffc-volume local roads. These roads have different types 
and volumes of traffc. Accordingly, they are designed and constructed in different ways. 
ISTUDY6 Pavement Engineering 
Thicker pavements are constructed for both heavier and high-volume traffc, of which trucks 
are the major load applicators. Thinner pavements are for low-volume roads, although in 
many cases low-volume roads may carry heavy trucks such as log trucks. Pavements are 
also provided for bike paths and recreational/walking/hiking areas. 
2. Pavement for airports: Pavements are required in airports in aircraft holding/terminal 
areas, taxiways, and runways. Just as road pavements are subjected to a wide range of 
vehicles, airport pavements are subjected to a wide range of aircrafts—a small, general 
aviation airport may have only light aircrafts (e.g., < 30,000 lb), while a large hub/major 
airport would have heavier aircrafts. The different pavement areas are runways, taxiways, 
and aprons. Special considerations such as protection from fuel are required in many cases. 
3. Pavement for parking lots: Parking lots are essential features in cities and towns and are 
commonly found adjacent to business/offce buildings, including those near hospitals, 
schools, and airports. 
4. Loading and unloading areas in ports and other areas: Heavy-duty pavements are con￾structed to support equipment and materials unloaded from ships, rail, and trucks. These 
areas may also require special protections such as those from fuel droppings/spillage. 
Figure 1.4 shows a comparison of thickness of different types of pavements. Note that in addition 
to thicker layers, pavements carrying heavier and more traffc also consist of better materials. For 
example, a > 300 mm thick full depth asphalt pavement is found in an airport, whereas a 63 mm hot 
mix asphalt layer over a 75 mm aggregate base course is suffcient for a low-traffc-volume local road. 
1.8 DIFFERENT FEATURES OF TYPICAL ASPHALT PAVEMENTS 
The bottom layer on which the pavement is built is called the subgrade. The other layers, upward 
in order, are the subbase, base, binder, and surface layers. In many cases the pavement can be a full 
depth asphalt pavement, in which case all of the layers above the subgrade are composed of HMA 
constructed in several layers (or lifts). In other cases, the subbase and base may be combined to form 
one single layer as far as materials are concerned but are constructed in multiple layers. And fnally,

ISTUDYIntroduction and Description of Pavements 7 
above the surface layer of HMA there may be a very thin wearing course of specialty material, such 
as permeable friction course (PFC), to provide better friction and faster drainage of water. 
Generally, the materials become better and costlier as one moves up from the subgrade layer to 
surface layer. On a per unit weight cost basis, the surface layer is probably the most expensive layer. 
This is because as layers at the surface and near it are subjected to the direct application of traffc 
loads and environmental effects they need to be “fortifed” to resist the traffc and environmental 
effects. These “fortifcations” come mostly in the form of higher asphalt binder content, which is 
the more costly component. Furthermore, stricter specifcations on size, shape, and quality of aggre￾gates are also responsible for higher prices of the surface and near-surface layers. 
A binder layer is provided because it would be diffcult to compact the surface and the binder lay￾ers into one step; also because the binder layer part can be made up of larger aggregates and lower 
asphalt content, it will cost less. 
The base layer could be designed as a permeable base layer to let any water inside the pavement 
fow down to the sides for drainage. This water can be coming from the top—rain and snow through 
open voids or cracks in the surface—or from groundwater. The surface layer should be compacted 
to a high density, and cracks should be flled as soon as possible to prevent the fow of rain and snow 
water inside. On the other hand, groundwater level should be reduced before construction of the 
pavements by providing interceptor drains. However, there could still be some water coming inside 
the pavement which needs to be drained out. 
The layers in the pavement provide different functions. While the wearing layer in PFC may 
provide friction and channels for quick draining water, the binder and layers below provide the 
stiffness to prevent excessive defection, cracking, and structural rutting. Good performing sur￾face and binder layers should have suffcient stiffness to prevent rutting related to poor materials. 
Furthermore, the layer (surface or wearing) exposed to the environment should not be too stiff at 
low temperatures (during the winter months) to avoid cracking caused by a drop in temperature. 
There could be a design in which the surface layer is stiff, followed by less stiff binder, base, and 
subbase layers. There could also be a design in which the bottom parts are less stiff but made with 
high asphalt contents to prevent cracking, whereas the top parts are stiffer with low asphalt content 
to prevent rutting, and the surface is sealed with a thin layer of mix with high asphalt content to 
provide a smooth and dense wearing layer. The point is that the materials and the structure can be 
engineered to provide a pavement with desirable qualities. 
The density of the different layers is crucial for the proper functioning of an asphalt pavement. 
Soil/aggregate layers are compacted to maximum density using an optimum additive content. In 
the case of the HMA layers, they are compacted to a specifc density (or voids) that has been found 
to be optimum for that specifc mix (e.g., 6%–8% air voids for dense graded mixes) using a design 
asphalt content. There is a subtle difference between the two approaches that are used for the selec￾tion of the optimum additive content for the layers other than HMA and the one that is used for 
selecting the design asphalt content for HMA. For non-HMA layers, the optimum additive content 
is that which produces the maximum density; for HMA layers, the design asphalt content is one that 
produces 4% voids in compacted mixes in the laboratory. 
The base course and subbase course are sometimes made up of different materials since the sub￾base can be made up of less costly material. If the base is open graded, then the subbase can serve 
as a flter with fne graded material between the base course and the subgrade. Even if no outside 
material is added before starting construction of the pavement, the top 6 in. of the existing subgrade 
are usually scarifed and compacted to a high density using optimum moisture content. 
One important requirement of an asphalt pavement is that there must be suffcient bonding 
between the different layers so as to prevent any slippage at the interface between the layers. Tack 
coatings of asphalt emulsions, for example, are applied between two HMA layers to achieve this. A 
tack coat is used between two asphalt layers or between an old PCC layer and a new asphalt layer to 
form a good bond. The spraying must be uniform and of the right amount per unit area, and if emul￾sion is used it must reach the desirable condition before the application of the upper layer. A prime

coat is used between a granular material layer and an asphalt mix layer. The requirement is that the 
prime coat material must penetrate the voids and seal them up in the granular material. 
In a full depth asphalt pavement, all layers starting from the base layers and up are made of 
asphalt mix. This type of pavement has a higher initial cost, but if designed and constructed prop￾erly, it provides several advantages over layered structures with different materials, such as little or 
no ingress of moisture and reduction in time of construction. Such pavements may deteriorate only 
at the surface with time, and rehabilitation work will be far less than that in pavements with differ￾ent materials. 
1.9 DIFFERENT FEATURES OF TYPICAL CONCRETE PAVEMENTS 
There are three conventional types of concrete pavements: jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP; 
Figure 1.5a-b), jointed reinforced concrete pavement (JRCP; Figure 1.5c), and continuously rein￾forced concrete pavement (CRCP; Figure 1.5d). For all conventional rigid pavement types, a con￾crete slab is usually poured directly on a subgrade, base, or subbase. The base or subbase could 
be a bonded or unbonded material that provides adequate support, drainage, and an even working 
surface during construction. All the three common rigid pavements carry traffc loading through 
fexural strength of the concrete. However, they differ in the slab lengths, joint details, and the type 
and amount of reinforcement they use. 
1.9.1 JOINTED PLAIN CONCRETE PAVEMENTS 
Jointed plain concrete pavements (JPCP) are the most common type of rigid pavements due to 
their cost and simplicity (Figure 1.6a). Contraction joints are typically constructed every 12–20 ft 
apart to control mid-slab cracking (Figure 1.6b-c). In JPCP, no slab reinforcement is used except 
for dowel bars placed at transverse joints or tiebars at longitudinal joints. Dowels are used for load

transfer across transverse joints and allow the joints to move along the longitudinal axis of the dowel. 
Conversely, tiebars keep the longitudinal joints held tightly together. Figure 1.7a-c shows dowel bar 
assembly for joint construction, tiebars at longitudinal joints, and a fnished-contraction joint. 
If dowels are not used, then load transfer across the joint can be achieved through aggregate 
shear interlock. Aggregate interlock is developed once a joint is cut in the young concrete pave￾ment and a crack develops along the depth of the slab. Aggregate interlock is effective as long as 
the joint widths remain narrow. If a joint opening becomes too wide due to drying shrinkage and 
temperature effects, the aggregate shear interlock becomes ineffective. Repeated heavy loads across 
the transverse joint can cause the aggregate bond to wear down along the crack wall and render the 
aggregate shear bond ineffective. This will result in joint deformations that become excessive and 
result in faulting, a bumpy ride, and joint failure. According to a 1999 survey by ACPA, about 70% 
of the state highway agencies in the United States use JPCP (ACPA, 1999). 
1.9.2 JOINTED REINFORCED CONCRETE PAVEMENTS 
Jointed reinforced concrete pavements (JRCP) are similar to JPCP except for the longer slabs and 
the added light reinforcement in the slabs. Joint spacing is typically 25–40 ft, although joint spac￾ing of 100 ft has been used (Huang, 2004). For the longer slabs and joint spacing, dowels are highly 
recommended since joint openings will be wider and aggregate interlock will be ineffective for 
load transfer across the joint. The percentage of steel used in the longitudinal direction is typi￾cally 0.1%–0.25% of the concrete cross-sectional area; less is used in the transverse direction. The 
steel reinforcement in JRCP is not used for carrying structural loads but to hold the cracks tightly 
together to preserve shear load transfer across the cracks. The steel is placed near mid-slab depth or 
close to the neutral axis where bending stresses are close to zero. This reinforcement is also termed

“temperature steel” since its purpose is to hold the cracks caused by temperature stresses tightly 
together. The steel reinforcement can be steel rebar, typically No. 5, or a wire fabric grid. According 
to a 1999 survey by ACPA, about 20% of the state highway agencies in the United States use JRCP 
(ACPA, 1999). 
1.9.3 CONTINUOUSLY REINFORCED CONCRETE PAVEMENTS 
Continuously reinforced concrete pavements (CRCP) are heavily reinforced concrete slabs with 
no contraction joints. Hairline cracks do occur in CRCP but are not a concern to the performance 
of the pavement (Huang, 2004). This characteristic cracking pattern consists of cracks typically 
spaced every 2–8 ft. They are held tightly together by reinforcing steel, which allows for aggregate 
interlock and shear transfer. If this aggregate shear interlock is not maintained and compromised, 
then punchout failure at the pavement edge occurs, which is a typical distress in CRCP. The amount 
of reinforcing steel used in the longitudinal direction is typically 0.6%–0.8% of the cross-sectional 
area of the concrete; less is used as temperature steel in the transverse direction. Experience has 
shown that if the amount of steel used in CRCP is less than 0.6%, the potential for punchout distress 
occurring is greater (Huang, 2004). CRCP require special anchors at both the beginning and the end 
of the pavement to keep the ends from contracting and to allow the slab to develop the characteristic 
crack pattern (Dellate, 2008). Figure 1.8 shows CRCP and slipform paving construction operations. 
The cost of CRCP is much higher than JPCP or JRCP because of the heavy reinforcing steel 
used. However, CRCP may prove cost-effective in high-traffc-volume roadways due to their better

long-term performance compared to the other types of concrete pavements. According to a study 
of 14 CRCP using the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) database, all but three CRCP had 
serviceability indices of 4 or better even though all the pavements carried heavy traffc and had 
exceeded their 20 year design life (Delatte et al., 2000). CRCP is not used widely; according to a 
1999 survey by ACPA, only eight state highway agencies build CRCP (ACPA, 1999). 
1.9.4 COMPOSITE PAVEMENTS 
Composite pavements have been formally defned as “a structure comprising multiple, structurally 
signifcant, layers of different, sometimes heterogeneous composition. Two layers or more must 
employ dissimilar, manufactured binding agents” (Smith, 1963). The most common type of com￾posite pavement consists of a thin HMA layer over a thicker PCC pavement slab or CRC slab. The 
HMA part may consist of layers of materials (such as geotextiles) for retarding the growth of refec￾tion cracks. The material in the PCC can be roller compacted or conventional PCC or one which 
contains recycled PCC material. The main load bearing component in the composite pavement 
is the PCC structure, whereas the function of the HMA is to provide a surface with good riding 
qualities. This type of pavement has been constructed mostly since the 1950s in a number of places 
including the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, United Kingdom, and Italy. A rela￾tively recent development is the use of low noise HMA over CRC. 
The concrete part could be PCC, CRCP, JRCP, or roller compacted concrete. For concrete over 
concrete pavements, generally the lower layers consist of locally available aggregates or recycled 
concrete while the upper layer (which could be a porous concrete layer) contains high-quality 
smaller size aggregates. 
For pavements with asphalt mix layer over concrete, it is important that the asphalt layer bonds 
well and has full friction with the concrete surface. A good asphalt mix layer on top of a concrete 
ISTUDY 
12 Pavement Engineering 
layer can help provide smoothness, noise reduction, and good friction. The common distresses in 
these pavements are debonding from the concrete layer and refection cracking as a result of move￾ment along a joint or a crack in the concrete slab. Sawing and sealing over existing joints in a con￾crete pavement can be used to reduce the potential of refection cracks. The key concept in such a 
pavement is that the concrete slab will not have fatigue damage, and that the relatively thick layer 
of asphalt mix could be milled and replaced easily to address the surface distresses. To make sure 
that the concrete slab does not experience fatigue damage, many factors must be taken into consid￾eration, which include providing adequate base course, thickness, joint spacing, and load transfer at 
joints in addition to the strength and thermal responses of the concrete. 
Generally, for concrete overlays over existing asphalt or concrete or composite pavements, a dis￾tinction is made between bonded and unbonded, or correspondingly, thin and thick. Bonded, thin 
overlays (or ultrathin, thin/white topping) are generally 2–5 in. in thickness and are generally used 
when the existing pavement is structurally sound with surface distress, such as friction loss. For 
design of such overlays, materials, bonding, and jointing (sawing after laydown) are critical factors 
for good performance. Generally the materials include high cement content and fber and produce 
a concrete that develops a high strength within a short period of time. The overlay can be placed 
directly on the existing asphalt pavement, unless there is rutting, in which case it needs to be milled 
and flled with concrete. Ultrathin-bonded PCC is used for areas such as parking lots or city streets, 
whereas thin-bonded overlays are used in secondary or state roads. 
Thick concrete overlays (4–11 in.) are generally used for increasing the structural capacity of an 
existing pavement with stable underlying layers. For the design of such a layer, the structural support 
of the entire existing pavement (i.e., asphalt) is utilized in terms of an effective strength parameter. 
And if laid on an asphalt pavement, the asphalt mix layer is considered a base course. 
Comprehensive information on concrete overlays can be obtained from the American Concrete 
Pavement Association website at www.acpa.org. The reader is also suggested to download the 
NCHRP Synthesis 338 on thin and ultrathin white topping from http://onlinepubs.trb.org/online￾pubs/nchrp/nchrp_syn_338.pdf. 
Note that in cases where the subgrade soil is extremely weak, cement treated subbases or bases 
are also used to provide adequate structural strength to the pavement. In such cases, the use of stone 
interlayer (crushed aggregate base) between the cement treated layer and the asphalt mix layer has 
been found to be effective in reducing the potential of refective cracking in the asphalt mix layer 
due to shrinkage cracks in the cement treated layer below (Chen et al., 2014). 
1.9.5 SELECTING THE TYPE OF PAVEMENT 
The selection of the appropriate type of pavement for a specifc project should be made on the basis 
of primary factors that include traffc, soil type, construction considerations, climate, recycling 
options, and cost and secondary factors such as energy and material conservation and availability, 
performance history, and adjacent pavements. Traffc is affected by many factors such as fuel prices, 
competition among different modes of transportation in government policies, and a proper margin 
of safety—comparison of alternative short and long-term strategies to minimize traffc disruption 
should be made. Both loads and volumes of traffc are important, and the consideration of fex￾ibility of timing of construction (for day-night) as well as stage construction should be considered. 
Concrete pavements can provide a long life, whereas well-designed asphalt pavements, with peri￾odic surface distress maintenance, can also provide good performing and long-lasting pavements. 
Subgrade soils under the pavement must be stiff and durable enough to resist both construction and 
traffc loading without excessive distress. For subgrade soils, the key factors are geographical and 
seasonal variability. The climate and the type of soil (with respect to gradation, drainage, and stiff￾ness) will dictate the need for the use of additives, if required, during stabilization and compaction. 
Periodic rainfall and freeze-thaw can have signifcant seasonal effects on the stiffness of the sub￾grade. Furthermore, the temperature of the project region also needs to be considered for the proper 
ISTUDYIntroduction and Description of Pavements 13 
selection of materials for the pavements. In this respect, the availability of the selected material is 
also an important issue. Finally, for construction, the factors of the option of staged construction, 
the speed of construction, maintenance of traffc fow during construction, timing, experience and 
ease of construction, and the ability to accommodate consideration of future traffc growth should 
be considered. 
1.10 RESEARCH ON PAVEMENTS 
Continuous research is needed to produce better materials, processes, and designs to make pave￾ments safer, durable, and more cost effective. Such research can be basic or applied for solving 
specifc problems. In the United States, the benefts of the Strategic Highway Research Program 
(SHRP) have been estimated to be a savings of up to $785 million annually (for an investment of 
$50 million in asphalts), not considering the benefts to the motorist of a reduction in delays and 
vehicle wear and tear (Halladay, 1998). Benefts of investments in research can also be quantifed 
in terms of reduction of road agency costs. The beneft-to-cost ratios are dependent on the infation￾free discount rate and have been reported to range from 4 to 5. In addition, unquantifable benefts 
such as boosting innovation and improved cooperation of researchers and practitioners have also 
been noted (Rose and Bennett, 1994). 
Since pavement engineering involves innumerable different disciplines, research potentials are 
abundant in this feld. In a broad way, research on pavement engineering can be grouped into three 
major categories—materials, structures, and construction related. Material-related research work 
involves the development of innovative materials, mixtures, and additives and chemical and mate￾rial characterization. Structure-related research involves the development and use of advanced tech￾niques, sensors, equipment, and models for understanding the pavement structure and its different 
components. Research related to construction includes activities such as the development of new 
procedures and equipment for faster and better construction, construction under diffcult condi￾tions, and/or the utilization of recycling/marginal materials as well as those related to better qual￾ity control and specifcations. Some of the emerging areas of research include those related to the 
environment, maintenance materials, microscale characterization, the use of nondestructive and 
accelerated testing, and recycling. 
Research on pavements is conducted by industry and government organizations all over the 
world. In the United States, pavement research is conducted at local, state, and federal levels. The 
National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP), which brings together the AASHTO, 
FHWA, U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT), and National Academies, is the primary 
sponsor of national-level pavement research in the United States. Similarly, the Federal Aviation 
Administration sponsors pavement-related research through the Asphalt Airfeld Pavement 
Technology Programs (AAPTP) and the Innovative Pavement Research Foundation (IPRF). The 
FAA and FHWA also conduct research on material characterization as well as on accelerated load￾ing and testing through both in-house as well as academia-based centers. 
The longest road test in history to be implemented was the LTPP program. The motivation 
behind the LTPP was to create a pavement performance database on all different pavement types in 
different climatic and soil conditions throughout the United States and Canada. The LTPP program 
started in 1987 as part of the SHRP, a 5-year applied research program supported by Congress and 
managed by Transportation Research Board (TRB). The intent of the 20-year LTPP program was 
to conduct a long-term pavement performance study that would cover the life cycle of typical pave￾ments. Ultimately, the most valuable outcome of the LTPP program was the creation and develop￾ment of a comprehensive “national” pavement performance database. Analysis studies using the 
database will enhance our knowledge of how pavements behave and will also help us develop tools 
and engineering products to analyze, design, construct, and rehabilitate pavements in a sustain￾able cost-effective manner. The LTTP data have been consolidated and made available into a user 
friendly format at https://infopave.fhwa.dot.gov/. The interface provides tools for downloading data 
ISTUDY 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14 Pavement Engineering 
from the database using different flters (such as age, experiments, or performance). Additional 
information and tools include section summary reports, comparison of data, the LTTP data and 
climate data for the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) input feature, rigid 
pavement design software, dynamic modulus prediction, and binder selection tool (PG selection, 
LTTPBind) with user data input feature. The site also contains a rich library of research reports on 
the utilization of LTPP data. 
Research on pavements requires a basic knowledge of principles, formulation of problems, devel￾opment and application of appropriate theory, utilization of appropriate equipment and tools, and 
proper inference of results. A thorough literature review is the key to successful research. The 
Transportation Research International Documentation (TRID; http://trid.trb.org/) is a very power￾ful database that can be accessed and queried online to conduct a literature review on pavement 
engineering. Information is also available from state DOT websites (see the following site: https:// 
research.transportation.org/state-dot-research/), as well as industry websites such as the Asphalt 
Institute (www.asphaltinstitute.org/), the National Asphalt Pavement Association (www.hotmix. 
org), and the Portland Cement Association (www.cement.org). 
A number of general and specialty conferences are held every year or on alternate years all over 
the world on pavement-related research. One of the biggest assets in pavement research (as in any 
other case) is the teamwork/cooperation of industry/academic and government agencies as well as 
the cooperation between researchers in different countries. Researchers and students should take 
opportunities to learn about new things and network with fellow students and researchers in dif￾ferent schools/industries and countries. The area of pavement research is so vast that people from a 
wide variety of backgrounds can fnd their niche areas of research. However, in general, knowledge 
on numerical techniques, mechanics, basic physics, and chemistry is essential. 
Readers should also be aware of the latest (2006–2015) Second Strategic Highway Research 
Program (SHRP2). The focus of this program was to conduct applied research in the following four 
areas: safety, renewal, reliability, and capacity. The goals are to prevent or reduce the severity of 
highway crashes by understanding driver behavior (safety); address the aging infrastructure through 
rapid design and construction methods that cause minimal disruption and produce long-lived facili￾ties (renewal); reduce congestion through incident reduction, management, response, and mitigation 
(reliability); and integrate mobility, economic, environmental, and community needs in the plan￾ning and designing of transportation capacity (capacity). More information on SHRP2 is available 
at www.trb.org/StrategicHighwayResearchProgram2SHRP2/Blank2.aspx.

2 Standards 
2.1 IMPORTANCE OF STANDARDS 
Standards are documents provided by experts and recognized organizations that provide guide￾lines or characteristics of common activities to ensure consistency, quality, and safety. Standards 
are developed on the basis of research and experience (and are subsequently revised, as needed) 
through a consensus of groups of experts. Generally, standards used in pavement engineering are 
those that are developed by traditional formal organizations such as the American Society for 
Testing and Materials (ASTM International; www.astm.org), the American Association of State 
and Highway Transportation Offcials (AASHTO; www.transportation.org), the Asphalt Institute 
(www.asphaltinstitute.org), the American Concrete Institute (ACT; www.aci-int.org), and the 
British Standards Institution (BSI; www.bsi-global.com). They are developed through a very open 
and transparent process to ensure the representation of all stakeholders. Standards on safety can 
be obtained from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) website (https:// 
www.osha.gov/). 
Each standard is an accumulation of years of experience in that specifc topic. The use of appro￾priate standards can help the proper utilization of that combined experience; they make the process 
(being used) rational, practical, and up-to-date, and, as required, ensure to the maximum extent at 
that point of time, safety. Therefore, standards ensure uniformity and consistency, reliability, and 
safety in products and processes. The use of standards also ensures compatibility between different 
products and the best use of money. This is important since it means, for pavement engineering, the 
best use of the taxpayers’ dollars for road construction. 
For pavement engineering, there are various types of standards—such as those for conducting 
tests, interpreting results, and writing specifcations. Every test process is described in detail with 
mentions of relevant other standards, steps in inference, and methods of reporting the results. If a 
new test is developed, the standards provide guidance for conducting a round-robin study to deter￾mine the variability of results from that specifc test. Once conducted, the results are considered 
and transferred into inter and within-laboratory tolerance values. This ensures that in the future, if 
the tests are conducted, the variability in the results would point out inconsistencies or greater than 
expected errors, if any.

11. Precision and bias: This part provides the maximum variation that can be expected 
between two tests conducted in the same laboratory and between tests conducted in dif￾ferent laboratories, as well as between the results obtained from this test and those from 
more accurate tests, considered as “true” values. 
12. Keywords: The last part presents a list of keywords against which this standard has been 
indexed. 
Other than tests, some of the other relevant ASTM standards include defning different termi￾nology, sampling materials, conducting ruggedness tests for detecting sources of variation in test 
methods, and establishing precision of test methods. 
The ASTM standards are generally designated as a two-part number; the frst number is the 
number of the standard, and the second number indicates the year in which it was frst adopted 
(or, if revised, the year of the last revision). A letter (e.g., D) indicates the group that deals with the 
subject matter under which the specifc topic presented in the standard falls is also mentioned in the 
designation. For example, see Figure 2.1. 
With the advent of global business and economy, in more and more cases, organizations are 
working on globalization of standards such that materials and process become compatible region￾ally, nationally, and internationally. 
2.3 THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF STATE HIGHWAY AND 
TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS 
AASHTO standards are developed either separately or, if appropriate, on the basis of existing 
ASTM standards by the AASHTO Highway Subcommittee of Materials with representatives of 
transportation department offcials in the United States, associate members, and international mem￾bers, such as those from the Canadian provinces and Korea. The set of standards is made available 
in two parts—Part 1 contains specifcations for materials, and Part 2 contains methods of tests and 
specifcations for testing equipment.

test and more accurate tests (considered as a “true” value). 
10. Keywords: The index keywords are listed in this part. 
2.4 USE OF STANDARDS IN MATERIALS SELECTION, 
MIX DESIGN, AND STRUCTURAL DESIGN 
Standards are used in selecting materials such as aggregates and asphalt, conducting tests, and 
interpreting results in mix design and structural design of pavements. The selection part involves 
using appropriate project/application conditions to choose specifc types of materials and avoid 
those that could be detrimental for such conditions. For example, for selecting aggregates, 
AASHTO Specifcation M 283 could be used. In the design step, standards are used for conduct￾ing tests, which involve sample preparation, fabricating test specimens, conducting tests, analyz￾ing data, and reporting results. An example is AASHTO T 27 for sieve analysis of fne and coarse 
aggregates. 
2.5 USE OF STANDARDS IN QUALITY CONTROL IN CONSTRUCTION 
In quality control and testing of pavements, the different steps involve developing a plan for qual￾ity control, sampling materials from the plant and the feld, conducting either feld or laboratory 
tests, and interpreting the results as evidence against which a pavement section could be accepted 
or rejected by the owner. These steps could involve the use of a series of standards, for example, 
ASTM D 3665 (Standard Practice for Random Sampling of Construction Materials) and ASTM D

3 Principles of Mix, Structural 
Design, and Construction 
of Asphalt Pavement 
3.1 OVERVIEW 
Flexible/asphalt pavements are generally made up of layers. Each layer is made up of a combina￾tion of materials—generally aggregate, binder, and any other additive. The process of designing 
the optimum combination of materials is called mix design. Once the structural properties of each 
layer are known (or estimated accurately), the optimum structure of the pavement is determined; 
that is, the thickness of each layer is determined. This process is called structural design, which 
also involves structural analysis—determination of stresses, strains, and deformations in different 
layers. 
Note that mix design and structural design are dependent on each other; for example, a structur￾ally better mix may only require a thin layer of the material to sustain a given load. However, the 
mix design is conducted in such a way that locally available (and hence relatively low cost) materials 
are utilized for economic reasons. This can be viewed as one of the most important “constraints” 
in the overall design of an asphalt pavement. The next logical consideration is that of the locally 
available materials; one would utilize the relatively less costly materials more (that is, in thicker 
layers) than the more costly components. Hence, for a given condition of traffc and environment, 
and for a given period of time for which the pavement is expected to be usable (design period), it 
is the most judicious combination of materials and thicknesses that results in the optimum design 
of a pavement structure. In this process, the two factors, material quality and material (as well as 
construction) cost, are balanced. Note that a pavement with very cheap materials would probably be 
able to sustain traffc loads in the short term but would require frequent maintenance, which could 
be costly in terms of both money and user delay. 
3.2 TRAFFIC AND LOAD DISTRIBUTION CONCEPT 
One of the basic purposes of providing a good mix and structural design is that the pavement can 
withstand traffc loads without deforming or deteriorating to a degree that it becomes unusable 
within the design period. Heavy freight truck traffc is the main contributor of load on highways, 
since their weight is signifcantly higher than cars, small pickup trucks, or other passenger vehicles. 
Similarly, the load from big multi-engine aircrafts is signifcantly higher than that coming from 
small single aircrafts on airport pavements. 
The load (from a vehicle/aircraft) is transferred to the pavement through load-bearing axles 
and pressurized tires. The resulting pressure or stress on the pavement, at any depth, is dependent 
on many factors such as total load, the number of axles and tires, and the condition of the tires. 
The stress on the surface of the pavement just below any tire is concentrated in the tire contact 
area, often assumed as a point for structural analysis. Theoretical concepts and validations have 
shown that this load gets distributed in an inverted V form from the surface downward. In other 
words, the stress intensity decreases along the depth of the pavement. However, note that if the 
stress on the surface is coming from two tires placed, say 13 in. apart (or even axles placed close 
to each other), the stresses from the two tires might overlap at some point below the surface. This 
can result in a combined stress that is higher than the stress resulting from each of the two tires. 
ISTUDY24 Pavement Engineering 
Obviously, whether or where (in the pavement) this would happen depends on the tire/axle con￾fguration and the thickness of the pavement. Since the pavement needs to sustain the stresses, one 
needs to take into consideration not only the gross load but also the relative positions of the axles 
and the gears during the structural analysis part. Figure 3.1 shows the gear/axle layout of a Boeing 
737 aircraft and a semi-tractor trailer, and Figure 3.2 illustrates the concept of distribution of load 
in the inverted V form.

3.3 MATERIALS AND LAYERS 
The layer on the surface of the pavement has to withstand the maximum stress and bear the chang￾ing conditions of the environment. Therefore, this surface layer usually consists of the “best” and 
most costly materials. Also, this layer is always “bound”—that is, mixed with a “binder,” in this 
case an asphalt binder—to prevent raveling of materials under traffc, as well as to provide a dense 
surface to prevent ingress of water, unless it is an open-graded friction course. Therefore, the sur￾face layer has two major components—asphalt binder and aggregates, with relatively small amounts 
of additive, if any. The mixture (referred to as mix) of this layer needs to be designed properly to 
give it adequate stiffness, strength, and durability. This mix is usually prepared by combining hot 
aggregates and asphalt binder (hot mix asphalt or HMA). 
The next layer could be either binder or base. Generally, the binder layer is almost similar to the 
surface layer except that it may consist of aggregates of larger size. The base may be made up of a 
bound layer or an unbound aggregate layer. The base layer has to be suffciently strong in shear as 
well as bearing capacity but need not be as good as the binder and surface course since the stresses 
at this level are much lower. However, the base needs to be stiff enough to provide an overall stiff￾ness to the pavement structure such that it does not defect too much under the load. How much is 
too much? That depends on the specifc mode of failure we are concerned with, but it would suffce 
to say here that if the pavement can sustain repetitive recoverable defection without cracking or 
having permanent deformation within the design period, then the defection is acceptable. One of 
the most important criteria for designing the base course is to provide adequate density. If it is a 
bound layer, it may be with aggregates and asphalt binder or Portland cement, and if it is an unbound 
layer, it is most likely with aggregates only with water used as an additive for aiding compaction 
during construction. The function of the subbase is almost similar to that of the base except that it 
could be of lower-quality materials since the stress is even less at this level. Generally, it is made up 
of aggregates only. 
The subgrade is made up of the existing soil or the soil mixed with some additives to enhance 
its properties. It serves as the foundation of the pavement and should be of such quality as to resist 
excessive defection under load. One important requirement is to make sure that the subgrade is 
capable of resisting the detrimental effects of water. Generally, the presence of excessive amounts 
of fne materials such as clays and silts are not desirable.

3.3.1 SOILS 
Soils or aggregates, which can be defned as processed soils, are present in every layer, either mainly 
by themselves, such as in unbound layers, or as a major component, such as in a bound layer. In the 
subgrade, the soil generally consists of unprocessed native soil compacted to a maximum achiev￾able density using an optimum moisture content and roller compaction. 
If the soil is incapable of resisting the detrimental effects of the environment or is too weak in 
shear strength and stiffness, it is generally “stabilized” with additives and/or adequate compaction. 
Stabilization is the process of improving the quality of the soil (in most cases, reducing its suscep￾tibility to the effect of moisture) with the addition of some other materials (known as additives). 
Soils can vary widely over a region or a state (e.g., see Figure 3.3). To determine whether the 
native soil is adequate for the proposed pavement (and if not, what kind of stabilization process is 
needed), one needs to test and characterize the soil. These tests are mostly conducted to evaluate its 
physical properties and the effect of moisture on some of those properties. Strength/stiffness under 
different stress levels is also determined. Based on the results of these tests, one decides whether the 
soil can be compacted and used as it is or if it should be mixed with an additive and then compacted. 
Note that some compaction is almost always necessary to improve its bearing capacity to sustain the 
stress from the weight of the construction equipment and layers of the pavements. In general, since 
the subgrade is the lowest layer, the stresses from these two sources are much greater than the stress 
from a vehicle. One important factor is the consideration of the thickness of the subgrade layer. That 
is, to be adequate, the subgrade must have desirable properties throughout a specifc depth.

ISTUDYMix, Structural Design, and Construction of Asphalt Pavement 27 
3.3.2 AGGREGATES 
It is primarily naturally occurring aggregates that are used in pavements. Aggregates are soil/rocks 
processed to produce materials of a certain range of sizes (and other properties). Aggregates generally 
refer to soil particles whose major portion is of a size greater than 0.075 mm. These particles are tested 
for their physical properties and characterized to determine their suitability. Unlike existing soil in the 
subgrade, the aggregates used in bound courses are actually the result of a combination of different 
proportions of different sized particles—the combination is done as part of the mix design process. 
Therefore, it is not only each aggregate particle but also the blend of the different sized particles 
that should be of desirable quality. Furthermore, such aggregates, when used in combination with 
asphalt, must also be of such (physical as well as chemical) quality as to resist cracking and retain 
the coating of asphalt binder under the action of traffc and harsh environmental conditions such 
as repetitive pore pressure due to the presence of moisture. Thus the characterization of aggregate 
involves a host of testing and evaluation steps that range from those used for determination of size 
and shape to the action of moisture under different conditions. 
3.3.3 ASPHALT 
Paving asphalt, also known as bitumen, is a product that is mostly obtained from crude petroleum 
through a series of refning steps. Asphalt can also be used in other forms, such as in an emulsifed form 
in asphalt emulsions. With reference to paving mixes, asphalt is commonly referred to as asphalt binder 
since its basic purpose is to “bind” the aggregate particles together. In general, asphalt binders are 
semisolid or solid at room temperature and liquid at a relatively high temperature. Different “grades” of 
asphalt binders are produced by changing the source (of crude petroleum) as well as the refning condi￾tions to meet different paving demands, mainly arising from differences in environmental and traffc 
conditions. Asphalt binders are classifed into different “grades” with the help of characterization tests. 
The properties of asphalt binders are affected signifcantly by the temperature and time of load￾ing. Thus, characterization of asphalt binders is required to determine the effect of temperature and 
stress on the relevant engineering properties—mainly for two basic applications. The frst applica￾tion is the actual mix design process where the asphalt should be of such grade as to produce a 
mix with aggregates that would be able to sustain the effects of traffc and the environment for the 
design life of the pavement. The second application of the characterization test results is for the 
construction process where the asphalt binder must be transported from a refnery, stored in a mix￾ing plant, pumped through pipes, mixed with aggregates, transported to the job site, and laid down 
and compacted at specifc temperatures that would allow the completion of all those steps in the 
most convenient way. Therefore, the characterization tests of asphalt binders involve similar tests at 
multiple temperatures using specifc loading rates. 
3.4 ENVIRONMENT 
Since pavements are exposed to the environment, proper consideration of environmental factors 
must be made. There are three major factors—temperature, moisture, and the effect of tempera￾ture on moisture. These factors affect the properties of the pavement materials signifcantly. For 
example, a higher temperature decreases the stiffness of the asphalt materials, whereas a lower 
temperature increases its stiffness. A higher moisture content would reduce the strength/stiffness of 
unbound materials, whereas a frozen moisture would increase the overall stiffness of the pavement. 
In addition to a one-time effect, the environmental factors affect the properties of the pavement 
materials through their repetitive/cyclic nature. Frost-susceptible soils with enough capacity to draw 
capillary water can form ice lenses during the winter and result in frost heaves, and as the ice lenses 
melt in spring (spring thaw), voids form underneath the top layers of the pavement, weakening it 
and ultimately resulting in the destruction of the pavement under traffc load. Figure 3.4 shows the 
different regions of the United States with respect to freeze-thaw.

National Research Council, Washington, DC. Reprinted with kind permission of the Transportation Research Board.) 
To consider these factors in the appropriate way, three steps are taken. First, the effects of the differ￾ent factors on the pavement materials are evaluated, and those materials that are proven to be suscep￾tible to the detrimental effects are eliminated from consideration. Second, to use available materials, 
and to avoid excessive costs, if it is not possible to eliminate all such materials, the available materials 
are modifed with additives to make them resistant to the detrimental effects of the environment. 
Third, during the structural analysis and design, the effect of the environmental conditions on the 
relevant parameters (such as stiffness) is duly taken into consideration, and any pavement layer/mate￾rial needed to eliminate the detrimental effect of the environment (such as frost action) is provided. 
One of the important pavement-related issues directly related to the environment is providing an ade￾quate surface and subsurface drainage system in the pavement. No matter what, some rain/snow water 
will always fnd its way into the pavement, and some groundwater will always seep inside the pavement. 
There should be a proper system to divert this water away from the pavement into side ditches/drains. 
3.5 MIX DESIGN 
The basic purpose of mix design is to select and combine the different components in such a 
way as to result in a mix that has the most optimum levels of all relevant properties so as to 
produce the best mix possible within the constraints of available materials and funds available 
to produce the mix. 
Therefore, the process starts with the selection of the most appropriate standard specifcation (or 
the development of one, if needed). The specifcation should clearly spell out the requirements for the 
materials in terms of properties to be determined by specifc tests, details of the tests, and acceptable/ 
not acceptable levels of results that are to be used. Then, according to the specifcation, aggregates, 
blends of aggregates, and asphalt binder are selected. Next, different blends of aggregates are tested

asphalt content is determined. Finally, the mix (design mix) with the selected gradation and the 
optimum asphalt content is tested at appropriate levels of controllable properties (such as air voids or 
density) to make sure that it is resistant to the detrimental effects of the environment. Furthermore, 
one needs to estimate the relevant structural design parameters for the designed mix. 
Depending on the importance of the project and the levels of sophistication employed in the 
testing and evaluation of the materials, the mix design process can range from a simple process to 
a fairly complex one. In any case, it is always a trial-and-error experimental process involving the 
testing of multiple samples for different test properties. Figure 3.5 shows the key steps in the mix 
design of an asphalt mixture.

3.6 STRUCTURAL DESIGN 
Structural design of a pavement is conducted to determine the thickness of the different layers to pre￾vent the occurrence of problems or distresses in the pavement due to traffc loading and the environ￾ment. Such distresses may include rutting or depressions in the wheel path and cracking. Figure 3.6 
shows the effect of different stresses and strains on distress or problems in asphalt pavements. 
The desirable thickness of the soil layers is determined from the consideration of their stiffness/ 
resistance to deformation properties (such as with the use of the test property California bearing 
ratio or CBR), as well as the change in the properties that can be expected due to a change in the 
environmental conditions, primarily moisture and the effect of temperature on moisture (Figure 3.7). 
However, note that in a pavement structure, the stress in the subgrade or subbase/base is governed 
by the imposed stress (vehicle load) as well as the thickness of the layers above them. Therefore, 
if the subgrade/subbase or base is known to be relatively weak, it should be protected by a proper 
selection of binder/surface mix and layer thickness. It follows that the structural design process in 
pavements is an iterative process that balances the availability of materials and the cost of the total 
pavement structure. 
The basic purpose of the structural design process is to combine the different layers in such a 
way as to result in the most cost-effective functional pavement structure. This can be achieved pri￾marily by two different techniques: (1) by using empirical methods—that is, charts and equations 
developed from experimental studies carried out with a set of traffc, environment, and pavements, 
or (2) by using a mechanistic method in which concepts of mechanics are used to predict responses 
and performance of the pavement. Note that a purely mechanistic approach is not possible at this 
time—the responses can be predicted by employing concepts of mechanics, but the performance 
has to be predicted by empirical models. Hence, it is more appropriate to say that pavements can

There are obviously differences in steps and levels of sophistication between the two processes. 
In the empirical approach, considering the traffc, environment, and available subgrade, an appro￾priate “chart” may be used to “read off” the required base course and/or the asphalt mix layer thick￾nesses. Such methods can be simple or fairly sophisticated and utilize different factors such as axle

FIGURE 3.8 Example of an empirical procedure for designing airport pavements for the Boeing 747 aircraft.

Transportation, Washington, DC, 1995, Figures 3–7.) 
numbers, drainage parameters, concepts of reliability, and performance-related properties of the 
pavement. Figure 3.8 shows an example of an empirical procedure for designing airport pavements 
for the Boeing 747 aircraft. Note that in this case, the CBR of the soil is used, along with aircraft 
information, to determine the thickness of the pavement (subbase + base + surface) required on the 
subgrade. 
The ME process is more of an iterative nature and can be divided into three basic steps. It 
starts with the consideration of traffc, design period, projected total traffc (expected over the 
design period), and environmental conditions. In the second step, by considering the load as well 
as environment-related properties of the available materials, a trial structure with different layers 
is designed, and stresses/strain/defections at different critical levels are determined. Finally, the 
stresses and strains are utilized in the empirical models to predict the performance of the pavement 
over the design period. If the performance is not found to be satisfactory, the process loops back to 
the second step and starts with a different trial structure. This process continues until a pavement 
structure with a satisfactory performance over the design period is obtained. 
Inherent in the design processes are the very important considerations of economics and the cost 
of the pavement over its entire “life” (referred to as life cycle cost or LCC). Considerations of both 
ISTUDYMix, Structural Design, and Construction of Asphalt Pavement 33 
 
 
initial cost and regular maintenance and salvage costs must be made during the design process, 
particularly for large projects (e.g., for pavement projects costing more than $1 million). 
3.7 LINK BETWEEN MIX AND STRUCTURAL DESIGN 
Mix design is generally conducted on the basis of volumetric properties. This process produces the 
job mix formula (JMF) according to which the mix to be used for paving is produced. This mix is 
tested for its structural properties, and, using the structural properties, the structural performance of 
the pavement with the specifc mix is predicted. Therefore, it is important to note that the structural 
performance is very much dependent on the mix design, even though structural properties may not 
be generally considered explicitly in the mix design process. 
An example is shown in Figure 3.9. It shows the effects of two parameters on the rutting 
performance of a mix under medium-volume traffc. The two parameters are the type of asphalt 
and the modulus of the base. The type of binder and the asphalt content of the base are selected 
during mix design. The years-to-failure chart shows that a “stiffer” asphalt binder takes a longer 
time to fail by rutting. That is, it has a higher resistance to structural rutting. At the same time, 
a mix with a high modulus base shows more resistance to structural rutting than the one with a 
low modulus. 
3.8 THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR STRUCTURAL DESIGN 
Before proceeding to structural design, it is necessary to review some of the basic mechanistic tech￾niques that enable us to compute stresses and strains due to loads. 
3.8.1 HOOKE’S THEORY OF ELASTICITY 
Ratio of stress over strain is a constant, Young’s Modulus, E (modulus of elasticity). This con￾stant relates stress to strain: σ= Eɛ. Poisson’s ratio (μ) is the ratio of radial and longitudinal strains. 
Figure 3.10 explains the different parameters:

Stress: σ = load divided by cross-sectional area = 4500/113 = 39.8 psi.
Strain: ɛ = elongation divided by original length = Δ/12.
By definition, modulus of elasticity, E = stress/strain = σ/ɛ.
Therefore, 39.8/Δ/12 = 22,000.
Or Δ = 0.022 in.
What happens if E was exactly double, that is, 44,000 psi?
Δ = 0.011 in. (half of the original elongation).

For flexible pavement design, layers are often simplified as homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic 
materials. However, in reality the traffic load is not applied at a point but spread over an area; for 
practical purposes, the equations for a point load can be used for a distributed load at distances 
equal to or greater than 2a from the centerline of the load. From Boussinesq’s equations, note that 
modulus and deflection are inversely related. When the modular ratio of the pavement (i.e., the 
combination of all layers above the subgrade) and the subgrade is close to unity, the equations for 
one-layer elastic solutions for subgrade stress, strain, and deflection are applicable. Tests show 
that in most cases stresses and deflections predicted by this method are larger than measured 
values.
3.8.3 aPPliCation, extension, and refinement of Boussinesq’s method
Foster and Ahlvin (1954) developed solutions for vertical and horizontal stress and vertical elas￾tic strains due to circular loaded plate, for μ = 0.5. Ahlvin and Ulery (1962) refined Foster’s and 
Ahlvin’s (1954) charts to develop solutions for complete pattern of stress, strain, and deflection at 
any point in the homogeneous mass for any value of μ. The solutions are as follows. Examples of 
coefficients in equations are presented in Table 3.1.

3.8.4 Burmister’s method for two-layer systems
Burmister (1962) developed solutions for stresses and displacements in two-layer systems: μ = 0.5 
for each layer, in homogeneous, isotropic, and elastic materials, with the surface layer infinite in 
extent in the lateral direction but of finite depth, the underlying layer infinite in both horizontal and 
vertical directions, layers in continuous contact, and the surface layer free of shearing and normal 
stress outside the loaded area.

Odemark developed a method whose principle is to transform a system consisting of layers with dif￾ferent moduli into an equivalent system where all the layers have the same modulus and on which 
Boussinesq’s equation may be used. This method is known as the method of equivalent thickness 
(MET) (Ullidtz, 1987).

where f is the correction factor that depends on layer thickness, modulus ratio, Poisson’s ratio, and 
number of layers in the structure. Frequently used values of f are as follows: 0.9 for a two-layer

Note that to use the MET, moduli should be decreasing with depth, preferably by a factor of at least 
2 between consecutive layers, and the equivalent thickness of a layer should preferably be larger 
than the radius of the loaded area. 
To illustrate the application of the MET for reducing a two-layer pavement system to a one-layer 
system, consider the last example where there are two layers—HMA of thickness 6in. and modulus 
360 ksi and a subgrade of 7.2 ksi modulus. If it is necessary to determine the stress at the bottom of 
the HMA layer (which is a critical factor for evaluating the fatigue cracking potential), and the only 
available equation is the one that is available for a one-layer system, that is,

How does one proceed? 
First, convert the HMA layer thickness to an equivalent thickness of the subgrade layer, and 
then utilize the aforementioned equation (for fnding stress) by considering z as that equivalent 
thickness:

3.8.6 FOX AND ACUM AND FOX’S SOLUTIONS 
Fox (1948) and Acum and Fox (1951) developed exact solutions for boundary stresses in the center￾line of a circular, uniformly distributed load acting on the surface of a three-layer half-space, μ = 0.5 
for all layers. They provided a tabular summary of normal and radial stresses in three-layer systems 
at the intersection of the plate axis with the layer interfaces; Jones (1962) expanded Fox and Acum 
and Fox’s solutions to a wider range. 
To fnd stresses, four parameters are needed: 
E1 a K1 = A = E2 h2
E2 h1 K2 = H = E3 h2
The procedure to calculate the different stresses is as follows. For vertical stresses, obtain, from 
graphs, ZZ1 and ZZ2 (see Figure 3.13 and Figure 3.14 for examples of values) and use the following: 
˜z1 ° p˛ZZ1˝ 3.35 
˜z2 ° p Z˛ ˝ Z2 3.36
For horizontal stresses, frst obtain the following from a table (see Table 3.2 for an example of 
values): 
°ZZ1˜ RR1˛
°ZZ2 ˜ RR2˛
°ZZ3 ˜ RR3˛
Then, use the following to calculate horizontal stresses from vertical stresses calculated earlier: 
˜ ° ˜ ˛ p[ZZ1° RR1] z1 r1 3.37 
˜ ° ˜ ˛ p[ZZ2 ° RR2] z2 r2 3.38 
˜ ° ˜ ˛ p[ZZ2 ° RR3] 3.39 z2 r3
Knowing σz1 and σr1, the horizontal strain at the bottom of layer 1, ɛrl, can be calculated as 
follows: 
°r1 °t1 °z1 ˜r1 ˝ ˙ ˛1 ˙ ˛1 3.40 E E E 1 1 1
Consider the following example. There is a three-layer pavement system—from the top they are, 
respectively (h denotes thickness and E denotes modulus), 
1. HMA layer, h1 = 3.8in., E1 = 360 ksi 
2. Granular base course, h2 = 15 in., E2 = 18 ksi 
3. Subgrade, E3 = 9 ksi

3.8.7 COMPUTER PROGRAMS 
Computer programs have been developed on the basis of the theory discussed earlier for calculat￾ing stresses, strains, and defections of a layered elastic system. They have gradually become more 
sophisticated in capability to handle linear elastic materials, nonlinear elastic granular materials, 
vertical as well as horizontal loads, elastic multilayer systems under multiple wheel loads, and 
stress-dependent material properties and in their applications of fnite element linear and nonlinear 
analysis. 
Examples include the following: BISTRO and BISAR (from Shell), ELSYM5 (from Chevron), 
ALIZEIII (LCPC) and CIRCLY (from MINCAD, Australia), DAMA (from the Asphalt Institute), 
SAPIV and ELSYM5 (from the University of California, Berkeley), PDMAP (Finn et al., 1986), 
the IILI-PAVE computer program (Raad and Figueroa, 1980), MICH-PAVE (Harichandran et al., 
1989), and Everstress (from the Evercalc suite of software from the Washington state DOT [1995]). 
The reader is advised to acquire any of the aforementioned software for the practice problems. 
One suggested software is MnPAVE (www.dot.state.mn.us/app/mnpave/software.html). Note that 
a 3D-fnite element software is available from the University of Maine (https://civil.umaine.edu/ 
everstressfe-2/). 
An example output (also containing input information) from Everstress with the last three-layer 
example problem is shown in Figure 3.15. 
Moduli of soils are affected signifcantly by the stress that is imposed by loading as well as the 
self-weight of materials (overburden), and generally the moduli of coarse grained soils is expressed 
as a function of the bulk stress whereas that of fne grained soils is expressed as a function of devia￾tor stress as follows: 
Power
E ˜ Multiplier Bulk stress 3.41 coarse grained °˛ ˝
Power
E ˜ Multiplier Deviator stress 3.42 fine grained °˛ ˝

In linear elastic analysis software, an iterative process is utilized to consider this nonlinear 
behavior of soils. Starting from an assumed (seed) modulus, the stresses are calculated, and the 
resultant modulus is checked against the seed modulus—this process is continued until a maximum 
tolerance (say 5%) of difference in modulus is reached. 
A fnite element software (3D-Move) that can account for viscoelastic behavior of asphalt mixes 
and considers moving and multiple loads as well as nonuniform contact stress has been recently 
made available by the University of Nevada, Reno, at www.arc.unr.edu/Software.html. 
3.9 PRINCIPLES OF GOOD CONSTRUCTION 
Pavement construction is a complex process involving many factors—each of which has the poten￾tial of affecting the quality of the constructed pavement in a very signifcant way. The process of 
good construction should start with the identifcation/adoption or creation of an appropriate speci￾fcation. This specifcation should lay out the details of the steps, determine tests required to make 
sure that the quality of the product is acceptable, and monitor the key parameters during construc￾tion such that errors can be identifed and rectifed quickly. 
Paving mixes are produced in plants, which can be of different types. The basic processes 
are the same. Aggregates of different sizes are mixed in specifc proportions, dried, mixed with 
asphalt at a high temperature, and then stored in silos or transported to the job site through insu￾lated trucks. During the mixing process, the steps are monitored closely to identify any malfunc￾tion. Since the mixing process is conducted at a specifc range of high temperature to make sure 
that the aggregates are dried and the asphalt is of a suffciently fuid nature to allow coating and 
mixing of aggregates and because the proportioning of different components is conducted in terms 
of weight, the temperature and weight measurements need to be monitored very closely during the 
process. 
Trucks take the mix to pavers at the job site. Pavers are self-propelled machines that lay down 
asphalt mix at a specifc depth and provide the initial compaction. A paver is a complex piece 
of machinery and has a number of moving parts including an auger and conveyors to mix the 
mix and send it to the back from the front hopper where it receives the mix from the trucks. 
The screed at the back of the paver maintains a specifc depth of the mix and must be controlled 
carefully. 
Right behind the paver come the rollers. Different rollers have different functions. Steel-wheel 
vibratory drum rollers help in initial compaction, and rubber-tired and static steel-wheel rollers 
provide intermediate and fnal compaction. The rollers must be of appropriate weight, and the fre￾quency and amplitude of vibration (for vibratory rollers) must be set at the appropriate level. The 
rollers should also move at the correct speed and in the correct pattern to ensure the best compaction 
possible. 
Finally, all through the production and laydown operation, an appropriate quality control pro￾cedure must be adopted to monitor key properties and correct, if necessary, any errors as quickly 
as possible. There may also be a quality assurance process to make sure that the quality control 
process is actually working. 
3.10 PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER 
The process of pavement construction actually begins during the mix design process and ends with 
compaction. While selecting materials for mix design, one needs to use experience and judgment, not 
only from the point of view of the optimum mix but also from the consideration of construction. In 
many cases, a mix that can be produced in small amounts in the laboratory during mix design may 
not be produced in large batches in the plant because of practical reasons—for example, due to the 
lack of locally available materials in suffcient amounts, the lack of appropriate fxtures in the plant 
machinery, or even the lack of suffcient paver and compaction equipment. 
ISTUDYMix, Structural Design, and Construction of Asphalt Pavement 51 
Hence, looking at the big picture is necessary from the very beginning. Consideration should be 
given to the type of project, environmental conditions expected during construction, and availabil￾ity of plant and feld equipment. 
The mixing process in the plant involves batching or proportioning a variety of aggregates of 
different sizes as well as liquid asphalt binder. Any deviation in these parameters would be refected 
in the constructed pavement—the key is to catch it through the use of appropriate tests in the plant 
and in the feld and to correct it quickly. 
One important consideration is the availability of the feet of the machinery required for trans￾porting the mix from the plant to the job site. The whole operation should be coordinated in such a 
way that the pavers and rollers keep moving smoothly at the appropriate speed. If required, a mate￾rial transfer vehicle may be used to receive and store the mix from the trucks so that the paver can 
keep working even if the fow of mix through trucks is hampered for a specifc time interval due to 
any reason. 
One signifcant factor that affects the quality of the fnished pavement is its air voids or density. 
Given that the mix design is accurate and the mixing process in the plant is working fne, four things 
have the most signifcant effect on the density of the pavement. These are the temperature of the 
mix, the ambient temperature (and wind), the availability of required rollers in appropriate num￾bers, and the thickness of the layer. It is crucial that appropriate considerations are given to these 
factors to ensure that for the given thickness and the existing environmental conditions at the site, 
within the allowable range of mixing temperature, there is suffcient time to compact the mix in the 
feld with the use of the available equipment.

axles, not including the steering axle) has been indicated. Can you sketch the axle/wheel 
confguration of the entire vehicle? For the subgrade consider a modulus and Poisson’s ratio

pressure of 690 kPa

4 Principles of Structural Design, 
Mix Design, and Construction 
of Concrete Pavements 
4.1 OVERVIEW 
Producing high-performance and long-lasting rigid pavements is a complex process that integrates 
appropriate design and materials, quality construction practices, timely maintenance, and overall 
adequate pavement management. The design of pavements requires more than “thickness design” 
for carrying fexural stresses. The pavement is subject to a range of loads and stresses induced by 
traffc loading, climate, and environmental factors. The design process balances a large number of 
interacting factors and constraints to produce pavement systems that are functional, sustainable, 
cost-effective, and long lasting. 
Properly designed, constructed, and maintained rigid pavements can provide years of service 
life. However, service life could be greatly reduced if any part of this pavement process is poorly 
executed resulting in signifcant cost to the owner (state highway agency, county, turnpike authority, 
etc.). It is important for pavement engineers and students alike to understand that producing func￾tional, cost-effective, and long-lasting pavements incorporates good science, good engineering and 
systems thinking, and adequate knowledge and experience about local conditions. 
Similar to fexible pavements, the design process for rigid pavements requires broad knowledge 
about topics such as: 
• Traffc loads that vary in magnitude and frequency and incorporate truck loading and 
incremental damage 
• In situ soils and layer bearing materials with respect to bearing capacity, compressibility, 
drainage issues, erosion, freezing environment, modeling nonlinear behavior, uniformity, 
and constructability 
• Design requirements with respect to loads, environment, early age behavior, slab dimen￾sions, reinforcement, joint design, and performance 
• Concrete mix design with respect to quality materials, construction requirements, early 
age behavior, strength gain, structural performance, volume stability, durability, changing 
environmental conditions, local availability, and sustainability 
• Design and construction details related to concrete placement, fnishing, curing, steel rein￾forcement, joint design, and construction 
• Life cycle cost analysis, sustainability, and energy considerations. 
The list of interactive variables and parameters is extensive. What is important is that pavement 
engineers must realize the complexity of this system and the interdependence of each component 
and subsystem in producing functional, cost-effective, and long-lasting pavements. Figure 4.1 shows 
a conceptual process to demonstrate the interaction between pavement structure, materials, and 
construction design.

environment, construction, short and long term pavement performance needs, pavement

(shrinkage and CTE); durability (i.e., freeze-thaw, salt scaling, chloride permeability, etc.),

4.2 STRUCTURAL DESIGN 
Structural design is based on the concept of limiting stresses and deformations to prevent excessive 
damage and deterioration of pavements. Overstressed pavements due to traffc loads and environ￾mental effects will result in pavement distress such as fatigue cracking, faulting, pumping, punchouts, 
and curling and warping as shown in Figure 4.2. The objective of pavement design is to recommend 
a pavement structure and confguration including slab thickness, slab length, mix design, reinforce￾ment requirements, joint details, and foundation support that can handle the required traffc loads, 
climate and environment conditions, and provide the expected level of performance at the desired 
cost. This is an ambitious requirement given the uncertainty and limits in predicting the behavior of 
all interacting components of such a complex system. Therefore, the approach is to study the sub￾systems that make up rigid pavements and use the available tools to achieve and realize pavements 
that are functional, long lasting, and cost effective. 
For analysis of stresses, a concrete pavement is idealized as a rigid slab resting on a spring￾like foundation. Theories, as explained in the next section, are used to develop equations relating

stresses and deformations to material and structural properties, and then analytical methods are 
used to predict these stresses and deformation on the basis of properties such as modulus, Poisson’s 
ratio, and stiffness of the subgrade, as well as temperature fuctuations. The design process essen￾tially consists of consideration of traffc and environmental factors and the use of the relevant prop￾erties (through material characterization tests) to ensure that the slab can sustain the stresses for the 
duration of its life without failing. 
4.3 THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
A rigid pavement is basically a slab resting on a subgrade or base. The slab is much stiffer than 
the supporting base or foundation material, and therefore it carries a signifcant portion of induced 
stresses. The load-carrying mechanism is similar to a beam action, although a concrete slab is much 
wider than the beam and should be considered as a plate. Westergaard (1926b) developed stress 
equations for rigid pavement slabs supported on a Winkler or liquid foundation, which is a concep￾tual model that considers the foundation as a series of springs. When the slab is loaded vertically 
down, the springs tend to push back; when the environment-related loads are pulling up on the slab, 
the springs tend to pull down toward the foundation (Figure 4.3). 
The induced stresses and their effects are controlled by a number of factors such as restrained 
temperature and moisture deformation, externally applied loads, volume changes of the supporting 
material and frost action, continuity of subgrade support through plastic deformation, or materials 
loss due to pumping action. 
Mathematical modeling of the true stress state of a PCC slab on a supporting foundation layer 
system is very complex due to variation in materials, nonlinear behavior, changing moisture and 
temperature conditions, changing support conditions, and complex interactions between compo￾nents. However, simple models can be developed once assumptions are made. 
4.3.1 STRESSES DUE TO CURVATURE AND BENDING IN SLABS 
If we consider that the pavement slab as a beam on an elastic foundation, then the reactive pres￾sure, p, can be related to the deformation, Δ, through the equation p = kΔ, where k is the modulus 
of subgrade reaction, which is the ratio of the pressure applied to the subgrade using a loaded area 
divided by the displacement experienced by that loaded area. Figure 4.4a-b shows a schematic of the 
spring constant and a plate load test for determining k. It is assumed that the modulus of subgrade 
reaction k is a constant and that the behavior is elastic. This assumption is only true over very small 
deformations and is greatly affected by numerous conditions such as soil type, density, moisture 
content, and stress state.

A concrete pavement slab will deform under load. The resistance to deformation due to loading 
depends upon the characteristics of the foundation and the stiffness or modulus value of the slab. 
The moment due to bending in a beam is given by the following equation: 
2 d y M E = I 2 4.1 
dx
where 
E is the modulus of elasticity 
I is the moment of inertia of the beam 
The stiffness term in the beam equation is expressed by the “EI” term. For an infnite thin plate, the 
moment Mx is given by the following equation:

Westergaard (1927) applied plate theory to a fnite PCC slab and supporting foundation and devel￾oped the relative stiffness expression “ℓ,” which is called the radius of relative stiffness. The radius 
of relative stiffness expression depends on both slab and foundation properties. The value for ℓ 
increases with a stiffer concrete, a thicker slab, and a weaker foundation. This term is used in many 
of the stress and defection equations derived for rigid pavements by Westergaard and others.

4.3.2 STRESSES DUE TO TEMPERATURE CURLING 
A concrete slab will undergo volume changes and develop stresses due to changes in temperature 
and moisture as shown in Figure 4.5. During the day, as the air temperature and sun increase 
the surface temperature of the concrete slab, the top of the slab will tend to expand relative 
to the neutral axis, and the bottom of the slab will tend to contract as it is insulated by the soil 
in the base. However, the weight of the slab will prevent it from contraction or expansion, and 
compressive stresses will be induced in the top layer of the slab while tensile stresses will 
be induced in the bottom layer. The opposite will occur at night when the air temperature will be 
cooler compared to the base of the slab since it is insulated by the base or subgrade. The top of 
the slab will be cooler compared to the bottom and will tend to contract. The slab weight will 
prevent the upward curling, and therefore tensile stresses will develop in the top of the slab while 
compressive stresses will be induced in the bottom of the slab. A similar effect is observed with 
moisture changes. As moisture is removed from the concrete slab, and specifcally the hydrated 
cement paste, the concrete will shrink. 
Another approach used to explain curling stress is by using the concept of plate theory and 
the concept of a “Liquid or Winkler Foundation” (Figure 4.3). When the surface temperature is 
greater than the bottom temperature, the top of the slab/plate tends to expand, and the springs 
react to this movement. The outside springs are compressed and push the plate outward, and 
the inner springs are in tension and pull the plate inward. This condition induces compressive 
stresses in the top of the slab and tensile stresses in the bottom. When the surface temperature 
of the slab is lower than the bottom temperature, the top tends to contract, and the bottom tends 
to expand. This produces an upward curvature of the slab (such that it can virtually hold water). 
The springs attached to the exterior edge of the slab are now in tension and pull the slab down, 
and the springs attached to the interior of the slab are in compression and push the slab outward, 
inducing tensile stresses in the top of the slab and compressive stresses in the bottom of the slab. 
The liquid foundation is analogous to the upward water force exerted on a boat. The weight of the 
boat displaces an amount of water that is equivalent to the total weight of the boat. A cubic foot 
of water displaced will create 62.4 pcf or 0.036 pci. The modulus of subgrade reaction for a soil 
could range from 50 to over 800 pci. 
Curling stresses are attributed to temperature changes between the top and bottom of the con￾crete slab. Curling stresses occur once a day as the top of the slab is heated or cooled. For example, 
over 30years of service, a pavement slab will experience approximately 10,950 fatigue cycles due

to temperature effects. This built-in curvature can cause mid-slab cracking if the joints and steel 
designs are not appropriate or suffcient. Warping stresses, on the other hand, are defned as stresses 
due to moisture changes in the concrete. Warping stresses occur practically once during the life 
of the slab as the concrete is poured, cures, and reaches some moisture equilibrium with the base. 
These stresses due to curling and warping are usually addressed by the joint and steel design of 
the slab. Fatigue cycles due to traffc loading can range in tens of millions of cycles for highways 
and hundreds of thousands of cycles for airports. Therefore, thickness designs for fatigue usually 
ignores curling and warping cycles, as is done in the PCA design method and which will be minimal 
according to Huang (Huang, 2004). 
Westergaard (1926a) developed equations for approximating the curling stresses in concrete 
pavements based on plate theory. These equations are very complex and will not be discussed in 
this book; they are discussed by Yoder and Witczak (1975) and Huang (2004). However, based on 
Westergaard’s curling stress analysis, Bradbury (1938) developed correction coeffcients Cx and Cy 
to determine curling stresses due to temperature in a fnite slab. The maximum total stresses at the

will contribute to mid-slab transverse cracking. The magnitude of the stress and defection will 
depend on the magnitude and location of the applied load. Closed form solutions were developed 
by Westergaard (1926a) to determine stresses and defections for three critical loading conditions 
applied to the corner, interior, and edge for idealized conditions. These equations are applicable to 
single wheel loads applied to very large slabs where the interior conditions are not infuenced by 
edge effects and the edge effects are not infuenced by corner effects. 
4.3.3.1 Corner Slab Loading 
The corner loading stresses for a slab were originally developed by Goldbeck (1919) and Older 
(1924) and discussed recently by Huang (2004). This solution is based on the simple bending stress 
equation 
Mc
˜ °
I
It assumes a load “P” to be placed at the corner of the slab. It is also assumed that the slab has no 
subgrade support if the entire support layer is washed away or the slab is curling away from the base. 
The desired stress plane occurs at a distance “x” from the corner with a failure plane of width “2x” 
assuming the stress to be symmetrical with the bisector (Figure 4.8). Based on a slab thickness h, 
the moment of inertia for the cracked section becomes 
bh3 2x h3 ° I ˜ ˜ 12 12
The maximum moment produced at a distance x along the bisector from the corner is “Px,” and thus 
Mc Px˛˝h / 2˙ 3P
˜ ° ° ° I 2x˛ h3 /12 h2
This solution, which shows that the stress produced decreases with the square of the slab thickness, 
is very conservative. It assumes no subgrade support under the slab, which is unlikely, and assumes

a point load at the corner instead of the load being distributed over a circular tire contact area, which 
would produce a lesser moment and stress. 
Westergaard (1926b) developed an updated corner equation based on a method of succes￾sive iterations, which was later modified by Ioannides et al. (1985) and discussed by Huang 
(2004). 
The corner stress σc and corner defection Δc based on a circular applied load at the corner of the 
slab are given by

where 
P is the concentrate load applied over a circular contact area with a contact radius “a” 
c a = 2 is the side length of a square contact area 
“ℓ” is the radius of relative stiffness 
“k” is the modulus of subgrade reaction 
The maximum moment occurs at a distance from the corner = 2 3. 8 ; note that the stress equation 
reduces to σ= 3P/h2 when the contact radius a = 0. Therefore, Westergaard’s updated stress equation 
will always produce a lower stress than the Goldbeck equation with the point load applied at the 
corner. 
Slab defections at the joints are important in contributing to pumping effects in rigid pavements. 
The larger the slab defection, the greater the potential exists for pumping of fnes and material sup￾porting the slab at the joint to occur. Once enough material that supports the slab has been removed, 
the potential for slab corner and edge breaks becomes greater. However, it should be noted that cor￾ner defections of slabs are more critical for pumping than edge defections since they have a higher 
magnitude for defection. Hence, controlling slab defections by using thicker pavements or the use 
of dowels at joints is highly recommended. Some pavement designers believe the use of dowels and 
a well-draining base course is more effcient and more cost-effective than using a thicker pavement 
slab (Dellate, 2008). 
Ioannides et al. (1985) proposed a different form of Westergaard’s equations based on fnite ele￾ment analysis. Based on the FE method, they found that the maximum moment in the concrete slab 
occurs at a distance of 1.8c0.32ℓ0.59 from the corner. If a load is applied over a circular area, the value 
of c must be selected so that the contact area for the circle and the square are equal, and therefore 
c = 1.772a. The bending stress and defection are provided as follows:

Comparing the stresses produced at the corner and the interior of the slab, the interior stress is 
23% less than the corner stress while the interior deflection is only 14% of the corner deflection. 
Note that the corner deflection using Westergaard’s equation assumes no load transfer at the joint. 
The stresses will be much smaller at the corner with effective transfer load across the joint.

Comparing all results for stress and defection from Example 4.2, Example 4.3, and Example 
4.4 as summarized in Table 4.1 it can be seen that the edge loading produces the largest stress 
with almost twice the value for the interior stress and therefore more critical to mid-slab transverse 
cracking. The edge loading using the semicircle loaded area produces a higher stress than the circle 
loaded area. This is due to the fact that the centroid of the semicircle area is closer to the edge of 
the slab than for the circle and therefore produces higher stresses. The corner loading produces the 
largest defection but also assumes no load transfer at the joint. This analysis, even though simpli￾fed, still emphasizes the critical need for providing load transfer at the joints such as dowels and a 
well-draining base support for mitigating pumping distress. 
The analytical solutions developed by Westergaard, Ioannides, and others are a good representation 
of idealized conditions. However, in practice, the assumptions are not realistic about the true pavement 
conditions. The corner and edge loads are very conservative. The edge loads must be right on the slab 
edge to create critical stresses calculated by the equations. These equations also assume very large 
slabs so that edge or corner effects are negligible. Tied and doweled joints and tied shoulders also 
reduce edge stresses considerably. Slab support, either full or partial, will also reduce corner stresses. 
Representing the foundation by a liquid foundation will also provide for an unrealistic k-value. The 
stress equations developed by Westergaard and verifed by others can only be applied to a single wheel 
load with simple contact areas such as circular, semicircular, elliptical, and semielliptical. 
In summary, the analytical solutions are good approximations for determining stresses and 
defections but fall short of truly characterizing the real conditions. 
4.4 COMPUTER PROGRAMS FOR RIGID PAVEMENTS 
Given the complexity of all the parameters that infuence the state of stress in a rigid pavement, fnite 
element methods are being used to determine the response of rigid pavements such as stresses, strains, 
and defections using a mechanistic approach. The MEPDG method (NCHRP 1–37) uses FEM models 
for determining stresses, strains, and deformations from a particular load, assesses the damage of each 
particular load, and then uses empirical models to predict pavement distress for the loading condi￾tion. A summation of all cumulative distresses (cracking, faulting, and smoothness using International 
Roughness Index [IRI] values) for the traffc spectra over the life of the pavement is predicted. 
ISTUDYStructural & Mix Design & Construction of Concrete Pavements 69 
Computer programs have been developed over the years to determine the complex response 
behavior of computing stresses, strains, and deformations for various types of rigid pavements, 
applied loads, and environmental conditions. Some of the programs developed specifcally for 
rigid pavements include ILLI-SLAB (Tabatabie and Barenberg, 1980), WESLIQID (Chou, 1981), 
JSLAB (Tayabji and Colley, 1983), KENSLAB (Huang, 1993), KOLA (Kok, 1990), FEACONS-IV 
(Choubane and Tia, 1992), and EverFE (Davids et al., 1998). Most of these programs can analyze 
multi-wheel loading of one or two-layered medium thick plates resting on a Winkler or liquid foun￾dation or on an elastic solid. 
ISLAB2000 is a proprietary revision of ILSL2 (Khazanovich and Loannides, 1994) and ILLI￾SLAB and was developed by Applied Research Associates, Inc. (ERES Division). ISLAB2000 was 
used in the development of the MEPDG guidelines. It was used for fnite element model develop￾ment for determining critical jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP) bottom surface stresses, and 
fnite element model development for determining critical continuously reinforced concrete pave￾ment (CRCP) stresses. 
ISLAB2000 is a more advanced software and can analyze many subgrade models (Winkler, 
Elastic Solid, Two Parametric, and others), partially bonded layers, the effects of linear and non￾linear temperature distribution throughout pavement layers, mismatched joints and partial depth 
cracks, and the effect of a widened base; it can defne many pavement layers and wheel loads and 
includes an enhanced void analysis model. The software also has advanced graphical capabilities. 
EverFE is an advanced 3D fnite element analysis software that can be used for simulating the 
response of JPCP systems subject to axle loads and environmental effects. EverFE can be used 
for linear or complex nonlinear analyses of JPCP. EverFE was developed jointly by the University 
of Maine and the University of Washington and is available for free download from www.civil. 
umaine.edu/everfe/. As a demonstration of the software, Example 4.1 is solved using the software 
EverFE. 
Table 4.2 shows the input data, and Figure 4.12a-e shows the EverFE data input window for tem￾perature gradient, materials properties, curling stresses for the top of the slab, curling stresses for the 
middle depth of the slab, and the results of the slab defection due to curling stresses, respectively.

4.5 COMBINED STRESSES 
The pavement community is divided on how to combine curling stresses with load stresses in the 
design process. Curling stresses due to temperature could be quite large and when coupled with 
loading stresses, they could be critical. For example, if the rigid pavement design is governed by 
edge stresses, then curling and loading stresses are additive during the day conditions and subtrac￾tive during night conditions as can be seen in Figure 4.5. Some believe that the joints and the steel 
reinforcement in the slab would mitigate temperature curling and stresses. The Portland Cement 
Association design method does not include curling stresses since the number of curling stress 
reversals is quite small during the life of the pavement compared to fatigue due to traffc loads. 
Warping stresses due to moisture changes in the pavement can also add signifcant stresses under 
the right conditions. The relative humidity in the concrete slab will vary from drier to wetter from 
the top to the bottom of the slab. However, some believe that rigid pavements basically go through 
one moisture cycle as the concrete is poured, cures, and reaches some moisture equilibrium with the 
base. In addition, moisture changes are seasonal, and moisture changes in the pavement are gradual. 
4.6 STRESSES DUE TO FRICTION 
Changes in temperature and moisture will create volume changes in concrete materials and will have 
signifcant effects on the concrete pavement slab. If a concrete slab, for example, is prevented from 
moving freely due to the friction between the slab and the supporting foundation, then stresses will 
develop in the concrete, in the reinforcing steel if it is included, and in the tiebars across longitudinal 
ISTUDYStructural & Mix Design & Construction of Concrete Pavements 71
joints and shoulders. Large volume changes due to temperature and moisture changes can cause joints 
to open too wide, therefore reducing aggregate interlock and decreasing joint transfer efficiency.
The selection of joint spacing should be chosen appropriately so that mid-slab cracking in the 
concrete slab does not occur or should occur infrequently if it does. Otherwise, steel reinforcement 
should be included so that cracks, if they occur, are held tightly together. The design of tiebars is 
also controlled by frictional stresses developed in the concrete.
Frictional stresses between a concrete slab and the foundation can be determined using a simple 
mechanics approach. Consider a concrete slab subject to a decrease in temperature as shown in Figure 
4.13. The concrete slab will tend to shrink toward the center of the slab from both ends. The frictional 
resistance between the concrete slab and the foundation will prevent the slab from moving, and the 
stresses in the concrete will develop. The magnitude of the frictional forces developed will depend 
on the relative movement between the slab and the foundation. Frictional forces will range from zero 
at the center where no movement occurs to a maximum some distance away from the center where 
movement is fully mobilized (Huang, 2004). Figure 4.13a shows a slab with the frictional forces. An 
average coefficient of friction fa is assumed. The maximum tensile stress in the concrete is achieved 
at the center of the slab and is determined by equating the frictional force per unit width of the slab, 
γcLfa/2, to the tensile force σch in the concrete. Figure 4.13b shows the free body diagram of the fric￾tional forces generated by the slab weight and frictional coefficient equated to the internal concrete 
tensile stresses. The concrete tensile strength is provided by the following equation, where σc is the 
concrete tensile strength, γc is the concrete unit weight, L is the length of the concrete slab, and fa is the 
average coefficient of friction between the slab and the subgrade. The value of fa is typically selected 
at 1.5 but will vary with the type of subgrade or base material and could vary from 0.9 to 3 (ACPA):

EXAMPLE 4.5
A concrete pavement slab as shown in Figure 4.14 has a joint spacing of 30 ft (6.1m) and a 
coefficient of friction equal to 1.5, the concrete unit weight γc = 150 pcf, and the concrete 
compressive strength is 3500 psi. Determine the stress developed in the concrete due to fric￾tional forces.

Given the concrete unit weight γc = 150 pcf = 0.0868 pci; L = 30 ft = 360 in.

Given the compressive strength of the concrete of 3500 psi, the tensile strength based on the 
ACI approximate equations is ft = 5 f t c c
' ' o 7.5 f ; since f p c
' = 3500 si, the tensile strength 
ranges between 295 psi (2.04 MPa) and 444 psi (3.06 MPa). Therefore, in general, it does not 
appear that the joint spacing in plain concrete pavements is governed by stress due to friction alone.
4.7 JOINT OPENING
The spacing of joints in JPCP will depend more on the shrinkage of the concrete than on other 
stresses generated in the concrete. Load transfer efficiency across the joint is greatly influenced 
by the extent of the width opening across the joint. If the joint opening is too wide (say 0.6 mm or 
greater), the aggregate interlock mechanism will not function effectively and cannot provide load 
transfer across the joint (Hansen et al., 2001).
An equation for approximating a joint opening was developed by Darter and Barenberg (1977) 
and discussed by Huang (2004) and FHWA (1989):
- - L C= + L t ( ) a E 4.22
where
ΔL is the joint opening caused by the change in temperature and the drying shrinkage of the concrete
α is the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of concrete; the CTE value is typically selected 
 between 5 and 6 × 10−6/°F but varies greatly with aggregate type (FHWA, 1989)
ε is the drying shrinkage coefficient of concrete typically ranging between 0.5 and 2.5 × 10−4 in./in.; 
 Table 4.3 shows values of CTE for typical materials
L is the slab length or joint spacing
Δt is the temperature change, which is the temperature at placement minus the lowest mean monthly 
 temperature
C is the adjustment factor due to slab-subbase friction, which is 0.65 for a stabilized base and 0.8 
 for a granular subbase
4.8 JOINTS
Joints are typically used in common pavements such as JPCP, JRCP, and CRCP to allow for con￾trolled concrete slab movement and cracking. Transverse contraction joints are typically used 
in JPCP and JRCP, which are usually doweled for heavily trafficked pavements. Construction

transverse or longitudinal joints are joints between slabs that result when concrete is placed at dif￾ferent times, for example, at the end of the daily pavement construction operation, due to equipment 
breakdown, or during long delays where concrete cold joints are not desirable. Transverse expansion 
(or isolation) joints are placed at specifc locations to allow the pavement to expand without damag￾ing adjacent structures such as bridges, drainage structures, or the pavement itself (FHWA, 1990).

ISTUDYStructural & Mix Design & Construction of Concrete Pavements 75 
Well-performing joints are critical to good performing pavements. According to FHWA, most 
jointed pavement failures can be attributed to joint failure as opposed to a lack of structural capacity. 
If a joint failure occurs, distresses such as faulting, pumping, spalling, corner breaks, blowups, and 
mid-panel cracking may develop. Good practices that contribute to good performing joints should 
be included in the design, construction, and maintenance of pavements. These include adequate 
load transfer at the joint, good concrete consolidation, proper and timely joint cutting, appropriate 
sealant use, and good maintenance repair practices. Adopting these practices should produce pave￾ment joints that are capable of performing well throughout the life of the pavement (FHWA, 1990). 
4.8.1 TRANSVERSE CONTRACTION JOINTS 
A transverse contraction joint is a joint that is sawed, formed, or grooved in a concrete slab. The 
joint creates a weak vertical plane and a point of high stress where cracks can initiate and propagate 
from. Contraction joints regulate the location of cracks formed due to dimensional changes caused 
by temperature and moisture changes in the concrete. Transverse joints in highways are used per￾pendicular to the direction of traffc, while longitudinal joints are placed parallel to the traffc and 
between traffc lanes. Airport pavements are much wider and use square concrete slabs that are 
doweled on all four sides. 
4.8.2 LONGITUDINAL JOINTS 
Longitudinal joints are constructed between two slabs and allow the slabs to warp or deform with￾out signifcant separation or cracking of the slabs. Although load transfer at longitudinal joints 
is achieved through aggregate interlock, tiebars are commonly used across longitudinal joints to 
prevent slab separation and faulting. The tiebars are usually thinner and longer deformed steel 
bars, unlike the smooth and bigger diameter dowels. Tiebars can also be epoxy coated for corrosion 
protection. Longitudinal joints can be sawn or constructed similar to transverse joints. For sawn 
joints, the tiebars are preset in tiebar baskets similar to dowels. Otherwise they can be mechanically 
inserted at slab mid-depth to connect the old and new concrete slabs together. Longitudinal joints 
are highly recommended when slab widths exceed 15ft, although some cases with slabs that wide 
have performed satisfactorily with minor longitudinal cracks occurring. It is also recommended that 
longitudinal joints should coincide with pavement lane lines to improve traffc operations whenever 
possible (FHWA, 1990). 
Tiebar design guidelines are provided by AASHTO Design Guidelines, 1993. FHWA recom￾mends that when using Grade 40 steel, a tiebar diameter of 5/8 and 30 in. length or 1/2 in. diameter 
and 24 in. length should be used. Similarly, when using Grade 60 steel, a tiebar with 5/8 in. diameter 
and 40in. length or 1/2in. diameter and 32in. length should be used. Since tiebars are held tightly 
to the concrete by bond shear strength, the recommended lengths are necessary to develop adequate 
bond. Tiebar spacing varies directly with the thickness of the pavement and the distance from the 
joint to the nearest free edge. Tiebars longer than 48 in. are not recommended. A common tiebar 
design is the use of the No. 4 bar, 36in. in length and spaced 30–40in. at the center (Huang, 2004). 
Table 4.4 shows the recommended tiebar spacings guidelines from ACI 325. 
4.8.3 CONSTRUCTION JOINTS 
Construction joints are either transverse or longitudinal joints that result when concrete is placed 
at different times. A good practice is that transverse construction joints should be placed where a 
planned contraction joint should be located. Construction joints should not be skewed due to the dif￾fculty in construction and concrete consolidation. Transverse construction joints should be doweled 
and butted but not keyed. Experience with keyed construction joints shows a tendency toward exces￾sive spalling and are not recommended. However, it is recommended that transverse construction

joints be sawed and sealed with similar sealant reservoir dimensions as transverse contraction joints 
(FHWA, 1990). 
Figure 4.17a shows a photo of a header and an expansion doweled joint and a basket assembly at 
a future transverse construction joint. During the paving operation the concrete will be placed up 
to the header. The header will then be removed when the concrete has set. When paving operations 
resume, the new concrete will be placed butted against the old concrete. 
4.8.4 EXPANSION JOINTS 
An expansion (or isolation) joint is a joint placed at a specifc location to allow the pavement to 
expand without damaging adjacent structures such as bridges, drainage, utility structures, or the 
pavement itself (Figure 4.17b). Properly designed and maintained contraction joints have practically 
eliminated the need for expansion joints except at fxed objects such as structures. As the pavement 
expands due to temperature and moisture changes, the expansion joints will tend to close over a 
period of several years. As this happens, adjoining contraction joints may open, which may destroy

the joint seals and aggregate interlock. Typically the width of an expansion joint is approximately 
3/4in. or more, while fller material is typically placed 3/4–1in. below the slab surface to allow 
space for sealing material. A special type of dowel assembly is used to transfer load across expan￾sion joints. The special joint dowel system is fabricated with a cap on one end of each dowel to 
create a void in the slab to accommodate the dowel as the adjacent slab closes the expansion joint. 
Figure 4.16 shows a diagram of the capped dowel system for expansion joints, and Figure 4.17b 
shows the construction of an expansion joint. 
Keyed longitudinal construction joints have been used in the past. Figure 4.18 shows a typical 
keyed joint. Problems with keyed longitudinal construction joints in the past have prompted caution 
in using this type of joint detail. The top of the slab above the keyway usually fails in shear. When 
the slab thickness is less than 10 in., it is recommended that keys should not be used, and tiebars 
should be designed to carry the load. When the slab thickness is greater than 10 in., keyways maybe 
used with great caution in addition to the tiebars. Keyways should be placed in the center of the 
concrete slab. Alternatively, keyways maybe eliminated altogether, and bigger and more tiebars can 
be used to carry the load across the longitudinal joint (FHWA, 1990). 
The effectiveness of tiebars to carry the load across the longitudinal joint and tie the adjacent 
slabs together is greatly dependent on the bond between the tiebar and the concrete. Tiebars could be 
mechanically inserted into the plastic concrete or installed as a two-part threaded tiebar and splice 
coupler system. To ensure that tiebars are securely anchored into the concrete, pullout tests should 
be conducted periodically for verifcation. It is not recommended to bend the tiebars. However, if 
bending of tiebars is necessary (e.g., for construction purposes), it is recommended that a two-part 
threaded tiebar and splice coupler system be used in place of tiebars. If tiebars must be bent and 
later straightened during construction, Grade 40 steel is recommended since it is more ductile than 
the higher grades and would tolerate the bending better. It is also recommended that longitudinal 
construction joints be sawed and sealed, and the sealant reservoir dimensions should be the same 
as those used for the longitudinal joints (FHWA, 1990). Figure 4.19 shows the construction of bent 
tiebars. 
4.8.5 JOINT DESIGN 
Joints are provided in concrete pavements to reduce the curling and warping effects and premature 
slab cracking due to temperature and moisture changes. Joint spacing should be short enough so that 
curling stresses do not develop and transverse cracking and faulting do not occur. 
The spacing of both transverse and longitudinal contraction joints depends greatly on local con￾ditions, such as the materials used, and environmental conditions. The joint spacing required to 
reduce intermediate slab cracking will decrease with an increase in CTE, positive temperature

gradient, base stiffness, or subbase frictional resistance; however, the spacing will increase with an 
increase in concrete tensile strength. Joint spacing is also related to slab thickness and joint seal￾ant capabilities. As a rough guide, the joint spacing in feet for plain concrete pavements should not 
greatly exceed twice the thickness in inches. For example, the maximum spacing for an 8in. slab is 
16 ft. Also, the ratio of slab width to length should not exceed 1.25 (AASHTO, 1993). 
According to FHWA (1990), a maximum transverse joint spacing of 15ft is recommended for plain 
concrete slabs. Performance however will be greatly dependent on local conditions, and slabs with 
longer slab lengths in some cases have also performed satisfactorily. Research studies have shown that 
pavement thickness, base stiffness, dimensional properties of the concrete, and climate have a great 
effect on the maximum joint spacing beyond which potential transverse cracking can be expected. In 
addition, it was observed that a relationship between the ratio of slab length (L) to the radius of relative 
stiffness (ℓ) and the amount of transverse cracking exists (Smith et al., 1990). Research data indicate 
that there is an increase in transverse cracking when the ratio L/ℓ exceeds 5.0. Figure 4.20 was devel￾oped using the relationship L/ℓ = 5.0, Ec = 4 × 106 psi and a Poisson’s ratio μ = 0.15. For example, the 
pavement thickness is 10in., and the slab foundation support, k = 100 pci, the slab length L = 18ft. If 
the foundation support increases to k = 500 pci, then the joint spacing is shortened to L = 12ft. 
4.8.6 JOINT SPACING FOR AIRFIELDS 
Joint spacing recommendations for airfeld pavements are provided by FAA-AC 150/5320-6D. 
For unstabilized bases, the recommended joint spacing for slab thickness greater than 12in. is 
25 ft, and for a slab thickness between 9 and 12 in. the joint spacing is 20 ft. For stabilized bases,

which increase k-values and curling stresses, the joint spacing is limited to “5ℓ.” Airfeld pavement 
joints are typically constructed as squares and are usually doweled. The FAA recommendations for 
dowel bar diameter, length, and spacing for a given slab thickness are given in Table 4.5 (FAA-AC 
150/5320-6D). Dowels are typically solid bars, but other types may also be used, such as high￾strength pipe plugged on either end with a cap, a bituminous or mortar mixture. Tiebars should be 
deformed steel bars with 5/8 in. diameter and spaced 30 in. center-to-center (FAA-AC 150/5320-6D; 
FAA, 2004). 
4.8.7 VARIABLE JOINT SPACING 
Construction joints are usually placed at regular intervals and perpendicular to the centerline of the 
pavement. However, if evenly spaced joints are faulted, then this can introduce harmonic motion 
in vehicle suspensions at certain vehicle speeds. To mitigate this problem, some State Highway 
Agencies (SHA) have used variable joint spacing. A variable joint spacing of 13, 19, 18, 12ft became 
a standard. However, the 19 and 18 ft panels were too long and were prone to mid-slab cracking. A 
ISTUDY 
80 Pavement Engineering 
new spacing of 12, 15, 13, 14 ft was then adopted as the new norm. According to FHWA-1990, when 
using randomized joint spacing, the longest slab should not be longer than 15 ft (Dellate, 2008). 
4.8.8 SKEWED JOINTS 
Skewed joints are cut at obtuse angles to the direction of traffc or the pavement centerline 
(Figure 4.21). The advantage of skewed joints is that the right and the left wheels do not arrive at the 
joint at the same time, which reduces the load transfer stresses on the joint. If a contraction joint is 
properly skewed, the left wheel of each axle will cross the joint onto the leave slab frst. And only 
one wheel crosses the joint at a time. 
4.8.9 AGGREGATE INTERLOCK BETWEEN JOINTS 
Effective load transfer across joints is important to minimize defections at the joint. Reduced joint 
defections will decrease the potential for subbase material pumping and faulting. This can be 
achieved using load transfer devices such as dowels or aggregate interlock (Figure 4.16). Aggregate 
interlock is achieved through frictional shearing forces at the aggregate-paste interface that devel￾ops below a joint saw cut. If joints are typically saw-cut 1/4–1/3 of the way through the slab depth, 
then a crack develops naturally through the remainer of the slab depth. Hard, angular, and durable 
aggregates will contribute to an improved aggregate interlock and load transfer effciency. A con￾crete mix with a larger size coarse aggregate that has a reduced cement paste content will shrink 
less and therefore keep the joint widths small. Any factors that increase crack width and are coupled 
with heavy traffc loads will contribute to a decrease in aggregate interlock and joint load transfer 
effciency. Therefore, the use of aggregate interlock for load transfer is recommended for use on 
local roads and streets, which carry a low volume of heavy traffc (FHWA, 1990). 
FIGURE 4.21 Image of a typical skewed joint. 
ISTUDYStructural & Mix Design & Construction of Concrete Pavements 81 
 
 
4.8.10 DESIGN OF DOWELS 
Dowels are used in transverse joints to enhance load transfer across the joint and prevent pumping 
and faulting distress (see Figure 4.16). Dowels are typically smooth metal rods that are lubricated 
to permit movement along the dowel’s longitudinal axis and allow joints to open and close without 
stress buildup. The FHWA recommends that all highway pavements carrying more than a low vol￾ume of heavy trucks should use doweled joints (FHWA, 1990). 
Dowels are typically used for pavement slabs 8in. or more in thickness. When dowels are used, 
they are typically 18 in. long and spaced 12 in. at the center. In a typical 12 ft lane, 11 dowels are 
commonly installed. However, during a pavement retroft operation, only three dowels are usually 
placed in each wheel path (Dellate, 2008). 
4.8.11 DOWEL DIAMETER DESIGN 
The appropriate design of dowels for effective load transfer across joints requires the selection of an 
appropriate dowel diameter. This is required for effectively transmitting shear and bending forces 
between slabs and reducing the bearing stress between the steel dowel and the concrete material 
to an acceptable level. Usually the concrete bearing stress will be the limiting design parameter. A 
sustained high stress level that is cyclic between the dowel and the concrete will erode the concrete 
material and loosen the dowel, reducing load transfer effectiveness (Dellate, 2008). 
The dowel-bearing stress is theoretically dependent on the concrete strength (see the next sec￾tion). Using this relationship, dowel diameters can technically be much smaller for a very high 
strength concrete. In practice, this does not hold true. Recommendations for dowel diameter size 
should be based on the thickness of the pavement slab. FHWA recommends that the minimum 
dowel diameter should be at least one-eighth the pavement thickness. However, the dowel diameter 
should not be less than 1¼ in., the dowel length should be 18 in. with a dowel spacing of 12 in. The 
Portland Cement Association (PCA, 1991) recommends the use of 1.25in. diameter dowels for high￾way pavements less than 10 in. thick and 1.5 in. diameter dowels for pavements 10 in. or thicker. A 
minimum dowel diameter of 1.25–1.5 in. is needed to control faulting by reducing the bearing stress 
in concrete. Corrosion of dowels should be avoided so that dowel joints do not seize up and lock. To 
mitigate corrosion problems with dowels, epoxy-coated dowels and stainless steel dowels have been 
used with good results (FHWA, 1990). Table 4.5 shows recommended dowel bar diameter, length, 
and spacing for different pavement thicknesses. 
The Smith and Hall study (Huang, 2004) recommends dowel diameter size based on the traffc 
level. For a pavement designed to carry less than 30 million ESALs, 1.25 in. diameter dowels are 
recommended; for a pavement carrying 30–90 million ESALs, a 1.5in. diameter dowel should be 
used; for traffc over 90 million ESALs, a 1.625 in. diameter dowel is recommended. 
4.8.11.1 Allowable Bearing Stress 
Because concrete is much weaker than steel, the size and spacing of dowels required are governed 
by the bearing stress between the dowel and concrete. The allowable bearing stress can be deter￾mined by the following ACI equation (Huang, 2004): 
˛4 ° d˝ f ˜ f˙ 4.23 b 3 c
where 
fb is the allowable bearing stress, psi

ISTUDY82 Pavement Engineering 
4.8.11.2 Bearing Stress on One Dowel 
If the load applied to one dowel is known, the maximum bearing stress can be determined theoreti￾cally by assuming the dowel to be a beam and the concrete to be a Winkler foundation (Huang, 
1993). Based on the original solution by Timoshenko (Timoshenko and Goodier, 1934/1951), Friberg 
(1938) developed a relationship for determining the maximum bearing stress (Figure 4.22). These 
equations are discussed by Yoder and Witczak (1975) and Huang (2004). First, the deformation of 
the dowel at the interface of the concrete can be expressed by the following equation: 
Pt ˛2 ° ˙z˝ y0 ˜ 3 4.24 4˙ E Id d
where

The bearing stress obtained from this equation should compare with the allowable bearing stress 
in the equation given for fb. If the actual bearing stress is greater than allowable, then dowel bars 
with a bigger diameter or a smaller dowel spacing should be used.
When a load is applied at the joint, the dowel bar immediately below the load carries a major 
portion of the load, while adjacent dowels will assume proportionally lesser amounts. Based on 
Westergaard’s solutions, Friberg (1938) determined that the maximum negative moment for both 
interior and edge loadings occurs at a distance of 1.8ℓ from the load, where ℓ is defined earlier as 
the radius of relative stiffness. More recent research has shown the effective length to be at 1.0ℓ 
(Heinrichs et al., 1989).

Figure 4.23 shows a concrete pavement, 9 in. thick, having a joint width of z = 0.2 in. (5.1 mm), 
a modulus of subgrade reaction of k = 120 pci (32 KN/m3
), and a modulus of dowel support 
K = 1.6 × 106 pci (434 GN/m3

dowel at a distance of 6 in. (152 mm) from the edge. The dowels are 3/4 in. (19 mm) in diam￾eter and 12 in. (305 mm) center to center. Determine the maximum bearing stress between the

The actual bearing of 3514 psi > allowable stress of 3250 psi; therefore, the design is not 
adequate. 
Now, let’s modify some of the input parameters and observe the changes in the actual and 
allowable stresses. 
If the concrete compressive strength fc
′ is increased to 3600 psi, the allowable stress 
increases to 3900 psi. This now provides an 11% margin, and the designer should 
decide if this is an adequate margin. 
If the dowel diameter is increased to 1 in. (25 mm), then the actual bearing stress σb = 
2090 psi (14.4MPa) and the allowable stress fb = 3000 psi (20.7MPa). Using a dowel 
diameter of 7/8in. (22mm) is still acceptable since the actual bearing stress σb = 2660 
psi (14.4MPa) and the allowable stress remains the same, fb = 3000 psi (20.7MPa). 
If the foundation becomes stiffer, and k = 200 pci (54 KN/m3
), then the actual stress 
increases σb = 3930 psi (27 MPa) and the allowable stress stays the same fb = 3250 
psi (22.410 MPa). 
If the slab thickness h and the concrete stiffness Ec are increased, and the foundation 
becomes weaker k is lower, then the value for ℓ increases and now both truck wheels 
must be considered in determining the Pt

First, the left wheel load acting at point A will be considered. If the dowel at point A has a 
load factor of 1.0, assuming a linear relationship, then the values for the other dowels can be 
determined using similar triangles as shown in Figure 4.24b. The sum of these factors is 4.35 
effective dowels, and the load carried by the dowel at point A is 4500/4.35 = 1035 lb (4.6 KN). 
The loads carried by the other dowels can be determined by linear proportion. 
The next step is to consider the 9000 lb (40 KN) wheel load at point B. If the dowel at point 
B has a load factor of 1.0, then the load factor at the other dowels can also be determined 
from similar triangles as shown in Figure 4.24c. The sum of all load factors is 7.30 effective 
dowels. The dowels beyond the longitudinal joint are not considered effective in carrying the 
load and are not included in the summation. The load carried by the dowel at point B is given 
by 4500/7.30 = 616 lb (2.7 KN). The load carried by the other dowels is proportional to the 
load factor. Finally, the loads carried by the dowels due to the combined wheel loads at both 
points A and B are provided in Figure 4.24d. The most critical load is carried by the dowel 
located at the edge of the pavement. This load should be used for design purposes. Assuming 
similar values from the previous example, we then calculate the dowel-bearing stress σb = 
3070 psi (21 MPa). 
4.8.12 TIEBAR STEEL DESIGN 
Tiebars are placed along longitudinal joints to keep two adjacent concrete slabs tied together or 
across pavement slabs and concrete shoulders (see Figure 4.15 and Figure 4.16). Tiebars are also 
used to maintain load transfer across the joints. However, load transfer for tiebars across longitudi￾nal joints is less critical than for dowel bars across transverse joints since traffc load is applied only 
when traffc changes lanes. Tiebars also differ from dowel bar in that they are not expected to allow 
movement. 
The amount of steel required to ensure adequate load transfer is also dependent on stresses gen￾erated due to friction. The design for tiebars is similar to the design for longitudinal and transverse 
temperature steel. The amount of steel required is given by Huang (2004): 
˛ chL°fa As ˜ 4.26 fs
As is the area of steel required per unit length of slab. L′ is the distance from the longitudinal joint 
to the free edge where no tiebars are present. 
For two-to three-lane highways, L′ is the lane width. If tiebars are used in all three longitudinal 
joints of a four-lane highway, L′ is equal to the lane width for the two outer joints and twice the lane 
width for the inner joint.

The length of tiebar design is based on the allowable bond stress. For deformed bars, an allow￾able bond stress of 350 psi is used, and the length of the bar is determined using the following equa￾tion (Huang, 2004):

4.8.13 TRAFFIC AND LOADS 
Rigid pavements, as well as most other highway and airport pavements, are subject to a mixed traf￾fc stream. Slab thickness design is required to protect against various distresses including crack￾ing, faulting, pumping, punchouts, and joint spalling among other distresses. The AASHTO method 
relates the axle equivalency method to the pavement damage based on loss of pavement serviceability 
as related to the standard 18 kip single axle load (AASHTO, 1993). The PCA method (PCA, 1984) 
determines the damage caused by each vehicle type in the traffc stream and accumulates the total 
damage over the life span of the pavement. This method considers fatigue and erosion (subgrade 
pumping) as the failure criteria. Slab thickness design is determined based on either fatigue damage 
or erosion damage. It should be noted that pumping failures can be controlled with adequate base or 
subbase design. The MEPDG method also relates damage due to traffc loading but for a specifc load 
group or traffc spectra within a specifc season. For the MEPDG method, thickness design is more 
involved, but traffc damage is compared to failure criteria for cracking, faulting, and smoothness. A 
different approach is used by the FAA empirical method. The FAA method uses the maximum gross 
weight of the aircraft for pavement thickness design. Figure 4.26 shows an example for slab thickness 
design for the Boeing 767, which requires additional input data such as the concrete fexural strength, 
subgrade bearing capacity, aircraft gear load, and gear spacing (FAA AC150/532-6D).

4.9 CONCRETE PROPERTIES AND MIX DESIGN 
Portland cement concrete (PCC) consists of Portland cement, coarse and fne aggregates, water, 
chemical and mineral admixtures, and may or may not contain entrained air. Concrete mix design is 
the process of determining the proportions of the different components and achieving the desirable 
mix characteristics based on the most sustainable, economical, and practical combination of readily 
available materials that will sustain traffc loads and environmental conditions. Concrete properties 
that are most important for design include the strength and stiffness, dimensional stability to tem￾perature and moisture, durability, and constructability. Of course, these desirable qualities must be 
considered within economic and environmental sustainability considerations. 
The fexural strength of concrete is a direct input into the design process. This could be deter￾mined directly using the bending beam test (ASTM C 78; AASHTO T 97) or indirectly using 
the compressive strength test (ASTM C 39; AASHTO T 22) values. When using the compressive 
strength, a correlation study for the selected mix design is highly recommended. The modulus 
of elasticity or stiffness of the concrete (ASTM C 469) relates stress-strain behavior and predicts 
deformation under load. This is a good predictor for how the concrete slab will defect and distribute 
traffc loading. 
Dimensional stability of the concrete to expansion, contraction, warping, and curling stresses is 
more involved. Shrinkage properties in concrete are associated with the water content in the mix. 
But more specifcally, they are related to the paste fraction and the resulting microstructure of the 
paste phase in the concrete. Temperature curling and volume changes are highly dependent on 
the type of aggregate. Generally, slabs made with a limestone coarse aggregate will have a lower 
thermal coeffcient, while slabs made with quartz or sandstone have a higher thermal coeffcient. 
Drying shrinkage and contraction will depend on the movement of moisture in and out of the 
paste. Dimensional changes have a large effect on rigid pavements and control curling and warping 
stresses, which can result in distresses such as corner breaks and mid-slab cracking, erosion and 
pumping, widened joint opening, and faulting. 
Durability is a more complex desirable characteristic to attain over the life of the pavement. 
Producing durable pavements is a balancing act between mix design, available materials, strength 
needs, construction details, and dimensional and chemical stability with the surrounding environ￾ment. Freeze-thaw durability, for example, can be addressed by appropriate air-void structure (air 
bubble size and distribution within the cement paste), which in turn decreases the strength at a given 
cement content. Increasing the cement content will increase the water demand for a given workabil￾ity. However, this in turn increases the potential for drying shrinkage, joint opening, a reduction of 
load transfer across joints, and the potential for joint failure. 
The design of a quality concrete mixture should satisfy a number of competing desirable per￾formance requirements for construction such as workability, ease of placement, consolidation and 
fnishing, early age properties such as setting time, just enough bleeding to avoid drying shrink￾age cracking, appropriate strength gain, volume stability to minimize curling and warping, bond 
strength to reinforcement and tiebars, protection against steel corrosion, adequate aggregate shear 
friction for load transfer across cracks and joints, sustainability, durability, appearance, and cost. A 
mix design leads to a concrete specifcation that imposes limits on used materials and properties. 
Ultimately, a desirable mix will be one that uses the maximum amount of aggregate volume, the 
least amount of cement materials that provide the required structural properties, and follows dura￾bility and construction requirements. 
Prior to proportioning the ingredients, the desirable concrete properties must be determined 
based on the intended use of the concrete to handle load and environmental stresses and construc￾tion requirements. Strength requirements will dictate a minimum cement content and water-cement 
ratio. Workability needs require fner aggregate and a higher water demand. Durability concerns 
for freeze-thaw durability, D-cracking, and corrosion of reinforcement may require more aggregate 
volume, less cement, and more fy ash (or other supplementary cementitious materials), which raises 
ISTUDY90 Pavement Engineering 
the water demand for more workability. Mix design is an interesting optimization process that 
requires elements of mix design, local experience, and good engineering decisions. 
The selection of the appropriate water-cementitious materials ratio (W/CM) infuences the qual￾ity of the cement paste mixture and ultimately the concrete mix. More important than strength, a 
concrete must be designed for durability, impermeability or water tightness, wear, and abrasion 
resistance. Once these characteristics are achieved, usually the required strength is satisfed too. 
4.9.1 HYDRATION, STRENGTH, AND MATERIALS 
When water is added to cement, an exothermic reaction called hydration occurs, which results in 
the formation of a number of compounds, the main one being calcium silicate hydrate. This process 
and the resulting chemical compounds provide the glue to bind the components of the mix together 
and provide the strength to hardened concrete. 
The water-cementitious materials ratio is the mass of water divided by the mass of all cements, 
blended cements, and pozzolanic materials such as fy ash, slag, silica fume, and natural pozzolans. 
In most literature, water-cement ratio (W/C) is used synonymously with W/CM. 
Assuming that a concrete is made with clean sound aggregates and that the cement hydration 
has progressed normally, the strength gain is inversely proportional to the W/CM ratio by mass. 
The paste strength is proportional to the solid’s volume or the cement density per unit volume. 
Differences in strength may also be infuenced by aggregate gradation, shape, particle size, sur￾face texture, strength, and stiffness or may be due to factors associated with cement materials (i.e., 
different sources, chemical composition, and physical attributes), the amount of entrained air and 
air-void system, and the effects of admixtures and curing. The strength of concrete is measured in 
terms of compressive strength of cylinders, and the strength gain is evaluated by checking strengths 
at different periods of time from the mixing of the concrete. 
Aggregates have a signifcant effect on the workability of fresh concrete. The aggregate particle 
size and gradation, shape, absorption, and surface texture will infuence the type of concrete that is 
produced with a given amount and quality of paste (cement plus water). The selection of the maxi￾mum size aggregate is governed by the thickness of the slab and by the closeness of the reinforcing 
steel. The larger size aggregates should not be obstructed and should fow easily during placement 
and consolidation. The CTE of the aggregate will have a large infuence on the CTE of the resulting 
concrete and its dimensional stability to temperature. This, in turn, will infuence concrete expan￾sion and contraction and curling stresses. 
The purposeful entrainment of air in concrete provides tremendous protection against freezing 
and thawing action and against deicing salts. Hydraulic pressure is generated when water in the 
paste pore structure freezes and pushes against the unfrozen water. The tiny, entrained air bubbles 
act as relief valves for this developed hydraulic pressure. 
Fresh concrete must have the appropriate workability, consistency, and plasticity suitable for con￾struction conditions. Workability is a measure of the ease of placement, consolidation, and fnishing 
of the concrete. Consistency is the ability of freshly mixed concrete to fow, and plasticity assesses 
the concrete’s ease of molding. If a concrete is too dry and crumbly or too wet and soupy, then it 
lacks plasticity. The slump test is a measure of consistency and indicates when the characteristics 
of the fresh mix have been changed or altered. However, the slump is indicative of workability 
when assessing similar mixtures. Different slumps are needed for different construction projects. 
Slipform paving, for example, will require a much stiffer consistency than fxed form paving. 
The cementing materials content is usually determined based on the specifed water-to-cementitious 
materials ratio. However, usually a minimum amount of cement is also specifed to ensure satisfac￾tory durability, fnishability, and wear resistance of slabs even though strength needs may be satis￾fed at lower cement contents. For durability, the type of cement used is also important. And fnally, 
admixtures are used in concrete to enhance the desirable characteristics in the fresh and hardened 
concrete.

Concrete admixtures are commonly used for producing high-quality concretes with low W/C 
ratios. Common concrete admixtures include air-entraining admixtures, water reducers, and set 
modifers. Other admixtures that are less commonly in use include lithium base chemicals for miti￾gating alkali-silica reaction, shrinkage reducing modifers, and corrosion inhibitors. 
Air-entraining agents are the most commonly used in concrete, and they are typically derived 
from pine wood resins, vinsol resins, and other synthetic detergents. They contribute to stabilizing 
tiny air bubbles that are uniformly distributed in the cement paste. In addition to protection against 
freezing and thawing and salt scaling, air entrainment can also enhance concrete workability at a 
reduced water content. Concretes with an average spacing factor of 0.008in. (0.2mm) will generally 
have adequate freeze-thaw durability. 
Water reducers are the second most common admixtures used in concrete. Water reducers are 
specifed by ASTM C 494/AASHTO M 194 and will reduce the amount of water needed for a given 
consistency or slump. For a given cement content, air content, and slump, the concrete strength 
could be increased by 10% or more. High-range water reducers (HRWRs) also called superplasti￾cizers, designated as ASTM Types F and G, can be used to reduce the required water content by 
12%–30%. The rate of slump loss with HRWRs could be very high and may affect consistency for 
slipform operations. Water reducers work by altering the charge on cement particles and preventing 
cement particles from clumping, freeing up trapped water for more hydration. 
Set-modifying admixtures are used to control (i.e., retard or accelerate) the rate of setting and 
strength gain of concretes. Altering setting functions for concrete are important for hot and cold 
weather concreting operations. These admixtures can also be useful for fast-track construction con￾trolling production cycles and allow concretes to be hauled over longer haul times. They can also accel￾erate the slower strength gain of concretes made with some supplementary cementitious materials. 
A fowchart showing the basic steps in mix design for concrete is shown in Figure 4.27. 
4.9.1.1 Construction 
The subgrade must be prepared to provide a uniform level surface. Protection against erosion, 
pumping, and frost action is important. If necessary, compaction and/or modifcation with additives 
such as lime treatment or cement treatment is conducted. The subgrade does not need to provide a 
large bearing capacity since the concrete slab is rigid and carries most of the stresses. Uniformity 
is more important to avoid areas of soft material or hard material, which could cause local areas of 
high stress under traffc loading. 
The base or subbase that is the layer supporting the concrete slab should provide adequate sup￾port and drainage. Uniformity is again more important than strength or bearing capacity. The free 
fowing of water is critically important to durability, pumping, and frost action. Bases may be bound 
FIGURE 4.27 Flowchart for concrete mix design. 
ISTUDY92 Pavement Engineering
or unbound. A granular base or a cement or asphalt treated base may be used. If bound material is 
used, an open-graded mixture should be used to provide adequate drainage and water flow.
Prior to construction, the selection of the construction methods, materials, mix design, concrete 
production, quality control plan, and delivery should be studied and planned. Trial mixes should be 
used to optimize the mix that will provide the required concrete for the needs of the project. Large 
batch testing and field testing is recommended given the variability of materials and climatic condi￾tions that could affect the concrete properties and construction process.
A pavement is commonly constructed by a slipform or fixed form process. Proper placing, con￾solidating, finishing, curing, and jointing a pavement requires skilled and experienced people and 
is critical to producing a quality product. It is commonly said that “constructing a poorly designed 
pavement well, will outperform a well designed pavement that is constructed poorly” (Dellate, 
2008).

5 Traffc 
5.1 DIFFERENT TYPES OF HIGHWAY TRAFFIC 
Different types of vehicles use roadways, and different types of aircrafts use airport pavements. For 
roads, the main destructive effects come from trucks since other vehicles such as passenger cars 
are signifcantly lighter than trucks. Again, actual truck traffc on pavements consists of a variety 
of loads and axles. Trucks can be of the single-unit type or of the tractor-semitrailer or trailer type. 
In the United States, combination trucks with 53 ft trailers are the most common. The gross 
maximum permissible weight is dictated by road agencies (such as the states in the United States) 
and depends on the number of the truck’s axles. Gross weights can range from 70,000 to 164,000 
lb. There are specifc guidelines regarding maximum weights per axle. For example, for highways 
other than interstates in the United States, the single-axle maximum is 18,000 lb, and the tandem 
axle maximum is 32,000 lb. The nominal spacing between a pair of axles in a tandem is 4ft. Axles 
can be spread apart to accommodate different weights. The federal bridge formula in the United 
States specifes the maximum weights as follows: 
˝ LN ˇ W ˜ 500 ˛12N ˛ 36 . 5.1 ˙
ˆN °1 ˘

where 
W is the maximum weight in pounds carried by any group of two or more axles 
L is the distance in feet between the extremes of any group of two or more axles 
N is the number of axles under consideration 
The defnitions of truck dimensions as well as some typical values are shown in Figure 5.1 and 
Figure 5.2. 
5.2 MEASUREMENT OF TRAFFIC LOADS 
Automatic traffc recorders (ATR) with different technologies—inductive loop (change in magnetic 
feld), piezo sensors (signal-voltage or current), road tube (air pulse), or infrared/radar detectors— 
can constantly count the number of vehicles (traffc volumes) passing through a location. The aver￾age daily traffc (ADT), the annual average daily traffc (AADT), and monthly seasonal adjustment 
factors can be determined from the ATR data. The inductive loop is often used with piezo sensors 
for axle detection to obtain comprehensive data about traffc number, length, and speed (automatic 
vehicle classifcation system [AVC]). Data can be transmitted to a central location from the feld 
by telemetry. A good example of statewide program of the use of ATRs and examples of traffc 
data analysis is available from the Maryland State Highway Administration (SHA) at https://roads. 
maryland.gov/mdotsha/pages/Index.aspx?PageId=251. 
For highway pavements, with the help of a weigh-in-motion (WIM) system, the load on each 
and every axle of each and every vehicle can be determined. In a mechanistic or mechanistic￾empirical structural design process such data can be used directly to determine the damage on the 
pavement by linking the stress/strain caused by such loads and the stress/strain versus performance 
relationships.

100 Pavement Engineering 
ASTM Standard E 1318 describes WIM as a system to measure the dynamic tire forces of a 
moving vehicle and estimate the tire loads of the static vehicle. WIM is used to collect traffc data 
and classify them according to different time periods, such as days and weeks. The specifc type 
of WIM that is used depends on the intended applications of the data, for example, collection of 
traffc data for design and/or weight enforcement. There are three primary types of WIM systems 
in use—load cell, bending plate, and piezoelectric sensor. In the load cell system, the load is 
directly measured with a load cell on scales placed on the pavement. In the bending plate system, 
strain gages attached at the bottom of a plate (i.e., inserted in the road) record the strain from a 
moving vehicle. The strain data are used to calculate the dynamic load and then the static load 
(using calibration constants). Piezoelectric sensors operate on the basis of generation of electricity 
in quartz-piezo sensors as a result of application of pressure on them. The quartz units in a sen￾sor (placed in the pavement) are usually inserted in epoxy-flled aluminum channels. The electric 
charge generated from the sensor is detected, and the dynamic and hence the static load of the 
axles are calculated. 
The data from the WIM system are processed by a data acquisition system and software 
at the site to generate time and traffic information (e.g., speed, weight of axle, and classifica￾tion) and are transmitted to the office computer as data files (such as in ASCII format). These 
data files can then be processed, using separate software, to generate detailed reports, such as 
those required for checking and calibrating WIM and classification of the traffic according to 
days or weeks. Figure 5.3 shows the commonly used piezoelectric sensor, installation on the 
pavement, the on-site data acquisition system, the software output, and an example of traffic 
classification. 
As noted in Figure 5.3, the traffc can be grouped into different types. For example, Table 5.1 
shows the FHWA classifcation system. 
In mechanistic-empirical design processes, data from WIM and automatic vehicle classifcation 
(AVC) systems can be used to determine the number of axle applications for each axle type and 
axle load group (full axle load spectrum) over the design period. Generally, vehicles in the range of 
classes 4–13 (FHWA classifcation system) are considered. 
5.3 LOAD EQUIVALENCY FACTOR AND 
EQUIVALENT SINGLE-AXLE LOAD 
The mixed stream of traffc is often considered in empirical design processes by converting the 
different axles with different loads to an equivalent number of standard axles, for example, the 
18,000-lb-or 18-kip-load single axle. The equivalency is based on the assumption that the load 
equivalency factor (LEF; also known as the equivalent single-axle load factor [ESAL factor]) 
of a specifc load/axle combination is the ratio of damage caused by one pass of the load/axle 
to a single pass of a standard 18-kip single axle. The damage can be represented in different 
methods—each design method may use a different parameter. The AASHTO design process 
uses the loss in serviceability, which is represented in terms of the present serviceability index 
(PSI), as the selected parameter. 
In the AASHTO design process, the terminal serviceability index, pt
, and the rigidity of the 
pavement structure (denoted by structural number, SN, for a fexible pavement and slab thickness, 
D, for a rigid pavement) are utilized, along with the specifc axle/load information to determine 
a load equivalency factor. The equations that were used to generate the LEFs for different axle 
loads and confgurations (single, tandem, and extended for tridem) are as follows (given in the 1986 
AASHTO Guide, vol. 2, Appendix MM).

Consider a pt of 2.5 and SN of 4. The total ESAL for the vehicle is (from Table 5.2) 0.204 (2 * 0.102). 
Note that the effect (in terms of ESAL) of single tire (carrying the same load as dual tires) is 10% 
higher. 
For design of a pavement, it is important that the total ESALs expected over the design period of 
the pavement (that is being designed) are estimated. This is accomplished by determining the cur￾rent ESALs and applying a growth factor (provided in AASHTO Guide, vol. 1, Table D-20, p. D-23; 
AASHTO, 1986 and p. D-24, AASHTO, 1993) for the expected growth rate (percentage) and design 
life (years). Examples of growth factors are shown in Table 5.3.

Finally, the estimated accumulated ESAL should be split into two directions and split further 
considering the multiple lanes. The recommended lane-split factors are shown in Table 5.4. An 
example calculation is shown in Figure 5.4. 
Quite often, since load station data are not available everywhere, many agencies determine an 
ESAL factor (also known as a truck factor) for each type of vehicle, considering the total number 
of axles for that vehicle. The vehicle types can be selected on the basis of the FHWA vehicle clas￾sifcation system (13 different types of vehicles, ranging from Class 1 to Class 13). Furthermore, 
an average truck factor can be determined by adding all of the products of number of axles times 
LEF and dividing the product by the total number of vehicles of that specifc type. These data from 
weighing stations can then be used directly to estimate the expected total ESALs on the pavement 
(i.e., the design traffc, or design ESAL). AASHTO recommends the use of SN = 5/D = 9 in. and

5.4 ALTERNATIVE LOAD EQUIVALENT FACTOR CONCEPT 
The concept of LEF can also be approached in a different way (as mentioned in Yoder and 
Witczak, 1975). Note that the ratio of damage by a single pass of the axle in question to a 
standard axle is the LEF. If Na passes of an axle cause failure (note that the “failure” has to be 
defned) of a pavement, as do Ns passes of a standard axle, then the damage due to one pass of 
the axle and the standard axle can be denoted by 1/Na and 1/Ns, respectively. According to the 
defnition of LEF, 
1/ Na Ns LEF = = 5.11 1/ Ns Na
Tests with fatigue cracking and analysis of cracking data with respect to tensile strain data show 
that the number of repetitions to failure of a pavement by fatigue cracking, due to repeated tensile 
strain, can be expressed as follows: 
° k2
N ˜ k ˇ
ˆ
˙ ˝
˛
1 f 1 ˘ t
where 
Nf
 is the repetitions to failure 
εt
 is the tensile strain in the asphalt mix layer 
k1 and k2 are constants obtained by plotting the experimental data (log εt
 vs. log Nf) 
It follows that LEF can also be then expressed as follows: 
2
° ˘ ta ˙
k
LEF ˜ ˝ ˇ 5.13 
˘˛ ts ˆ
where εta and εts correspond to the strains for the axle in question and the standard axle. The value 
of k2 has been reported to be between 3 and 6, with most common values being 4–5. 
The simplest approach (and a proven good approximation) is to use the fourth power law to con￾vert any axle load to an LEF as follows: 
4
° W ˙ a
˝
˛
LEF ˜ ˇ Ws ˆ
For example,

(In comparison, the AASHTO LEF for a 40-kip single-axle load for a fexible pavement with SN = 
5 and pt
 = 2.5 is 21.1 and that for SN = 6 and pt
 = 2.5 is 23.0.) 
5.5 EQUIVALENT SINGLE-WHEEL LOAD 
For airport pavements, the concept of equivalent single-wheel load (ESWL, as opposed to ESAL 
for highways) has been used. For fxed levels of traffc (e.g., x number of departures), charts relat￾ing pavement thickness to CBR (California bearing ratio, a test property used to estimate strength

of soil, Chapter 7) of the subgrade have been developed for specifc wheel loads. This development 
has been done on the basis of conversion of multiple-wheel gear loads to ESWL. A critical aircraft 
is considered, and the ESWLs for all aircrafts are converted to those for the critical aircraft. The 
ESWL is defned as the load on a single tire that will cause the same response (such as stress, 
strain, or defection) at a specifc point in a given pavement system that results from multiple-wheel 
loads at the same point in the same pavement system. 
In determining the ESWL, either the tire pressure or the tire contact area of the ESWL is con￾sidered to be similar to those of the tires in the multiple-wheel gear. The choice of the response 
in developing the ESWL for different gears depends on the agency using it—specifcally, on its 
experience in correlating the response of choice to feld performance. Derivations of ESWL can be 
made according to various procedures, such as the Asphalt Institute (AI), U.S. Navy, and U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers methods. Examples are shown in Table 5.7. 
In the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airport pavement design process, there are two 
steps to determining the equivalent load. First, each of the aircrafts (single-gear, dual-gear, dual￾tandem-gear, and wide-body aircrafts) is converted into an equivalent gear, and then the number of 
departures is converted into the equivalent annual departures of the design aircraft. The sum of all 
of the equivalent annual departures is the design traffc. Furthermore, the departures are converted 
to “coverages” to take the lateral distribution of aircraft traffc into consideration. The following 
sections explain the process. 
5.5.1 CONVERSION TO EQUIVALENT GEAR 
The effects of a variety of aircrafts using an airport is considered by converting all aircrafts to 
the same landing gear type as the design aircraft, using conversion factors (same for fexible and

Assume an airport pavement is to be designed for the following forecast traffc (Table 5.10). 
Step 1: Determine design aircraft. Using the charts provided in Section 2, Flexible Pavement 
Design, in FAA Circular 150-5320/6D, Federal Aviation Administration (1995), determine the 
thickness required for each aircraft. In the example in Table 5.10, the thickest pavement is required 
for the 727-200 aircraft, which is therefore the design aircraft. 
Step 2: Convert all aircrafts to landing gear of the design aircraft. 
Step 3: Convert equivalent dual-gear departures to equivalent annual departures for the design 
aircraft. 
5.6 TIRE PRESSURE 
The contact pressure at the interface of the tire and the pavement is important for determination 
of the structural response of the pavement. Quite often, the tire infation pressure is assumed to be 
equal to the contact pressure. Either the tire infation pressure is used, or, using an assumed ellipti￾cal or more commonly used circular contact area, the contact pressure is calculated from the load. 
The hot infation pressure could be 10%–15% more than the cold pressure, and it can range from 
90 to 120 psi with loads ranging from 3,600 to 6,600 lb. Assumed tire contact areas are shown in 
Figure 5.6. The tire infation pressure controls the tire contact stress at the center of the tire, whereas

the load actually dictates the contact stress at the tire edges. An increasing trend is the replacement 
of duals with super-single tires, which have signifcantly higher pressures and hence more damaging 
effects on the pavement. 
Tire contact pressure could be nonuniform across the contact area depending on the condition of 
the tire. If the tire is underinfated, the pressure will be higher at the edges, and if it is overinfated, 
the pressure is higher at the center. The existence of high-shear stresses and/or tensile stresses due to 
anomalies in axle/loading/tire pressure can lead to top-down cracking in asphalt mix surface layers. 
Currently, this is not considered in the structural design of highway pavements. 
5.7 SPEED 
For asphalt mix layers, the effect of loading time, which is dictated by the speed of the vehicle, is 
similar to the effect of temperature. In general, shorter loading times result in more elastic response 
and lower strains, whereas longer loading times result in more viscous response and larger strains. 
For structural design, the dynamic modulus can be determined at appropriate loading times to 
simulate the response under a vehicle moving at different speeds. For the same speed, any point at 
a greater depth from the surface will have a higher loading time compared to a point nearer to the 
surface. For an asphalt mix layer, one option is to assume that at the middle of the asphalt layer, the 
load is uniformly distributed over a circular area with a radius, r, where 
h

5.7.1 EFFECT OF LOAD AND TIRE PRESSURE 
There have been numerous accelerated loading/testing studies related to the effects of tire pressure 
and loading/axle confguration on response and distress of pavements. It has been observed that the 
tensile strain at the bottom of asphalt layers and the compressive strain at base and subgrade are 
affected more by load, whereas the compressive stress within the asphalt layer is affected primarily 
by the tire pressure. The vertical stress in the center contact zone is primarily dictated by the tire 
pressure, whereas the edge zone stress level depends mainly on the wheel load. Rutting (primarily 
in the aggregate base) and fatigue cracking increase by up to 2.4 and 4 times, respectively, due to the 
use of wide-based single tires instead of dual tires. For rutting in HMA, the increase has been found 
to be proportional to the increase in tire pressure. Transverse tensile contact stress has been found 
to develop across tread ribs leading to a reduction in shear strength of the pavement material. Traffc 
speed affects the transient defection (under wheel load) signifcantly—the defection is reduced dras￾tically from static (0 km/h) to a speed of 20 km/h, and the change is much less beyond that speed.

5.8 AIRCRAFT LOADING, GEAR CONFIGURATION, 
AND TIRE PRESSURE 
As the amount of load that an aircraft can carry has increased over the years, so have the number of 
gears. At the same time, realizing that a higher number of gears means heavier weight and more fuel 
spent in carrying the aircraft itself, aircraft companies have also tried to reduce the number of gears 
with a resulting increase in tire pressure and contact pressure on the pavement surface. It is expected 
that in the future both range and payload of aircrafts will go up which will result in increased loads 
on airport pavements. Figure 5.8 shows the load, gear confguration, and tire pressure of a few

6 Drainage 
6.1 SOURCES AND EFFECTS OF WATER 
Precipitation, in the form of rain and snow, may result in accumulation of water on the surface and 
fnd its way through joints and cracks inside a pavement structure. Water can also enter the subgrade 
soils through capillary action from a nearby water table. Water puddles or flms on the surface, 
especially in ruts, can cause unsafe driving conditions with vehicles hydroplaning and skidding, 
whereas water inside the pavement structure can result in the deterioration of the mixtures and 
materials. If frost-susceptible soils are present, ice lenses can form due to freezing temperatures in 
the winter and cause heaves. Then the thaw in the spring causes a loss of support and consequent 
cracking on the surface. The sources and effects of water are summarized in Figure 6.1. 
The damage due to the presence of water includes the following: 
1. The aggregate/soil layers lose shear strength due to an increase in moisture content or 
saturation which results in an increase in deformation when subjected to traffc loads. 
2. Repeated stress generation is due to repeated freeze-thaw in asphalt and soil layers. 
3. In the presence of water, vehicle loads cause hydrostatic pressures in soil layers, which 
cause movement of soil particles, especially near joints and cracks, leading to the displace￾ment of soil and a loss of support. The end result is the failure of the pavement by cracking 
and deformation. 
Of these three ways, the frst two are managed in the drainage design, while the third one is 
considered in the materials selection and mixture design process. 
Drainage refers to the system of providing ways to remove water from a pavement. In general, 
a drainage system consists of two separate subsystems—surface and subsurface drainage systems 
to avoid water coming from rain and/or snow and to remove water coming in through surface voids 
and/or cracks and from groundwater, respectively. 
6.2 ESTIMATING FLOW 
It is necessary to understand some hydrologic concepts before starting the design of drainage struc￾tures. The amount of water that needs to be drained away comes as runoff over areas and is dictated 
by the characteristics of the rainfall and the surface over which the water fows. This is illustrated 
with the rational method formula, which is the most commonly used equation to determine the 
runoff in drainage areas less than 80ha. The individual parameters in the formula are explained in 
the subsequent sections. 
The rational method equation is as follows: 
Q = 0.00278CIA 6.1 
where 
Q is the discharge, m3/s 
C is the runoff coeffcient 
I is the rainfall intensity, mm/h 
A is the drainage area, hectares (ha) [1 ha = 10,000 m2

FIGURE 6.1 Sources and effects of water. 
Runoff coeffcient, C, is the ratio of runoff to rainfall. It is affected by many characteristics; the 
more important are the soil group, land use, and average land slope. If the drainage area consists of 
different types of surfaces, then a weighted C value is used as follows: 
A C1 1 ° A C2 2 ° A C3 3 ° Weighted C, Cw ˜ A1 2 3 ° A ° A °
where 
Al
, A2, and A3 are the subareas with different types of surfaces 
C1, C2, and C3 are the corresponding runoff coeffcients 
Typical values of runoff coeffcients are shown in Figure 6.2. 
The selected rainfall intensity depends on two other parameters that should be discussed before 
discussing rainfall intensity: the time of concentration (Tc) and the return period. Tc is the time 
required for water to travel from the most hydraulically distant point of the drainage area to the 
drain system. It is used in the determination of inlet spacing as well as pipe sizing. For inlet spac￾ing, Tc is the time required for the water to fow from the hydraulically most distant point of the 
drainage area to the inlet (inlet time). This is the sum of the time required for water to fow across 
the pavement of the overland back of the curb to the gutter plus the time required for fow to move 
through the length of the gutter to the inlet. If the total time of concentration to the upstream inlet 
is less than 7 min, then a minimum Tc of 7 min should be used. For pipe sizing, the Tc consists of 
the inlet time plus the time required for the water to fow through the storm drain to the point under 
consideration. 
The time to fow overland can be determined from the chart shown in Figure 6.3 or by estimat￾ing the velocity from Figure 6.4 and dividing the length of fow by the velocity; the time to fow 
within the storm drain can be determined simply by dividing the length of the pipe for runoff travel 
by the estimated normal velocity of water fow, which can be determined from Manning’s equation, 
presented later in this chapter. 
If there is more than one source of runoff to a given point in a drain system, the longest Tc is used. 
For municipal areas, a minimum Tc of 5min is recommended.

6.2.1 RETURN PERIOD 
It is not possible to design drainage structures for a maximum runoff that it could produce—say, in 
an interval of a long period of time. Therefore, for practical purposes, a realistic discharge, which 
could result from the biggest rainstorm that is probable (as opposed to possible) within the design 
life of the drainage structure, is considered. Of course, the probability and the size of the biggest 
storm/food would be different for different types of pavements—a lower probability and a big￾ger storm/food would be considered for a more important highway than a less important one. For 
design purposes, all of these considerations are made through two parameters: design frequency 
and return period (RP) or recurrence interval (RI). The frequency with which a given food can 
be expected to occur is the reciprocal of the probability that the food will be equaled or exceeded 
in a given year. For example, if a food has a probability of 2% of being equaled or exceeded each 
year, over a long period of time, then the frequency is 1/(2/100) = 50, which means that the food 
will be equaled or exceeded on an average of once in every 50 years. The RI or RP is also 50 years. 
Looking at this in another way, the probability of being exceeded = 100/RP. Suggested values of RP 
are provided in Table 6.1. 
6.2.2 RAINFALL INTENSITY 
Rainfall intensity, I, is the intensity of rainfall in mm/h for a duration equal to the time of concen￾tration. Intensity multiplied by the duration gives the amount of rain for that duration. The rainfall 
intensity-duration-frequency plots for any weather station could be generated from the weather 
database at the NOAA Hydrometeorological Design Studies Center, Precipitation Frequency Data 
Server (www.nws.noaa.gov/oh/hdsc/). An example is shown in Figure 6.5. 
6.3 HYDROPLANING AND SURFACE DRAINAGE SYSTEM 
If the water from rainfall exceeds the depth that is required for hydroplaning for a specifc pave￾ment width and rainfall intensity, hydroplaning can be expected. In a broad sense, the potential of 
hydroplaning depends on vehicle speed, tire condition (pressure and tire tread), pavement microtex￾ture and macrotexture, cross-slope and grade, and pavement conditions such as rutting, depression,

Note: Federal law requires interstate highways to be provided with protection from the 2% food event, and facilities such as 
underpasses, depressed roadways, and the like where no overfow relief is available should be designed for the 2% event.

and roughness. Apart from the driver’s responsibility to control speed, the following steps could be 
taken to reduce the potential of hydroplaning and/or prevent accidents: 
1. Maximize transverse slope and roughness and use porous mixes (such as open graded fric￾tion course). 
2. Provide gutter inlets at suffciently close spacing to minimize the spread of water and 
maximize interception of gutter fow above superelevation transitions. 
3. Provide adequate slopes to reduce pond duration and depth in sag areas. 
4. Limit depth and duration of overtopping fow. 
5. Provide warning signs in sections identifed as problem areas. 
The basic principle of surface drainage is to design the pavement surface and the adjacent areas 
in such a way as to facilitate the quick fow of water falling in the form of rain and/or snow on the 
surface to the sides, and then drain it away to a nearest point of collection. This involves two major 
ISTUDYDrainage 123 
components—providing the adequate slope to the pavement surface and drainage channels with 
suffcient fow capacity along the pavement on either side. 
The minimum grade for a gutter is 0.2% for curbed pavements. For sag vertical curves, a minimum 
of a 0.3% slope should be maintained within 15m of the level point in the curve. In a very fat terrain, 
the slopes can be maintained by a rolling profle of the pavement. For one lane, the minimum pave￾ment cross slope is 0.015 m/m with an increase of 0.005 m/m for additional lanes. Slopes of up to 2% 
can be maintained without causing driver discomfort, whereas it may need to be increased above 2% 
for areas with intense rainfall. A 1.5% slope is generally maintained in airport pavements. 
In a multilane highway, if there are three or more lanes inclined at the same direction, it is rec￾ommended that each successive pair of lanes from the frst two lanes from the crown line have an 
increased slope compared to the frst two lanes (by about 0.5%–1%) with a maximum pavement 
cross slope of 4%. Note that the allowable water depths on inside lanes are lower because of high￾speed traffc on those lanes, and hence the sloping of inside lanes toward the median should be done 
with caution. Pavements also have longitudinal slopes—with a minimum of 0.5% and a maximum 
of 3%–6%, depending on the topography of the region. 
A high level of macrotexture on the pavement is desirable to allow the rainwater to escape from 
the tire-pavement interface and reduce the potential of hydroplaning. Tining of PCC pavement 
while it is still in a plastic state could be done to achieve this. For existing concrete pavements, 
macrotexture can be improved by grooving and milling. Such grooving in both transverse and lon￾gitudinal directions is very effective in enhancing drainage. The use of porous asphalt mix layers 
such as an open graded friction course allows rapid drainage of water. It is important that such lay￾ers are daylighted at the sides and are constructed over layers that have been compacted adequately 
to prevent the ingress of water downward. Runway pavements are generally grooved. 
The coeffcient of permeability of the surface mixture is dependent upon many factors, the more 
important of which are aggregate gradation and density. If the gradation consists of a relatively 
higher amount of coarse aggregate particles (compared to fne and fller materials), then the perme￾ability is relatively high. On the other hand, permeability decreases with an increase in density. 
Generally, the gradation is decided upon from other considerations, and the only available way 
for the pavement engineer to lower the permeability of the surface layer is through compaction 
which will provide adequate density. Note that because of the effects of the gradation, the desirable 
density will be different for mixtures with different gradations. Also note that no matter how dense 
the surface layer is, some water will fnd its way through it; there must be a way to get rid of this 
water through the use of the subsurface drainage system (apart from the fact that the materials must 
be resistant to the action of water to a certain extent). The permeability of new rigid and asphalt mix 
pavements can be assumed to be 0.2 and 0.5 in./h, respectively. 
There can be different types of drainage channels such as ditches, gutters, and culverts. The 
design of these channels means the design of the cross section. This design is accomplished with 
the help of Manning’s formula (Daugherty and Ingersoll, 1954): 
K 1 2/ 2 3/ Q = S R A

where 
Q is the pipe fow capacity, m3/s

Note: These criteria apply to shoulder widths of 1.8m or greater. Where shoulder widths are less than 1.8m, a minimum 
design spread of 1.8 m should be considered. 
The practical considerations for design include the elevation with respect to the subgrade (same 
or lower level than the subgrade), low construction and maintenance costs, and safeguards against 
slope failure (slope of 2:1 or less). 
Curbs are concrete or asphalt mix structures provided along the side of low-speed urban high￾ways as well as bridge decks to facilitate the collection of drained surface water from the pavement 
surface and protect the pavement sides from erosion. Curbs are generally placed with gutters. In 
rural areas, roadside and median channels are provided instead of curbs and gutters. 
For pavement drainage systems, two parameters are selected (Table 6.2) depending on the type 
of the pavement, design frequency, and spread (accumulated fow in and next to the roadway gutter, 
which can cause interruption to traffc fow, splash, or hydroplaning problems). The spread (T) is 
constant for a specifc design frequency—for higher magnitude storms, the spread can be allowed 
to utilize most of the pavement as an open channel. 
The nomograph shown in Figure 6.6 can be used to design gutter sections. An example is shown 
on the plot. Manning’s coeffcients are provided in Table 6.3. 
EXAMPLE 6�1 
Find spread, given fow 
Step 1. Given: S = 0.01, Sx = 0.02, Sw = 0.06, W = 0.6 m, n = 0.016, and Q = 0.057 m3/s 
trial value of Qs = 0.020 m3/s. 
Step 2. Calculate gutter fow: Qw = Q − Qs = 0.057 − 0.020 = 0.037. 
Step 3. Calculate ratios of (Eo=) Qw/Q = 0.037/0.057 = 0.65, and Sw/Sx = 0.06/0.02 = 3. 
Using Figure 6.7, fnd an appropriate value of W/T; W/T = 0.27. 
Step 4. Calculate T: T = W/(W/T) = 0.6/0.27 = 2.22m. 
Step 5. Find spread above the depressed section: Ts = 2.22 − 0.6 = 1.62m. 
Step 6. Use Figure 6.6 to determine Qs: Qs = 0.014 m3/s. 
The next nomograph, Figure 6.7 (ratio of frontal to gutter fow), can be used to calculate the 
frontal fow for grate inlets and fow in a composite gutter section with width (W) less than 
the total spread (T), which can also be determined from Figure 6.8.

6.4 INLETS 
Inlets are provided at regular intervals to collect surface water and convey them to the storm drains. 
The inlets could be of the grate or curb opening type or a combination of both. Grate inlets are suitable 
for continuous grades and should be made bike safe where bike traffc is expected. Curb openings are 
more suitable for sag points because they can let in large quantities of water and could be used where 
grates are hazardous for bikes or pedestrians. Inlets are spaced at regular intervals, as explained later, 
and also at points such as sag points in the gutter grade, upstream of median breaks, entrance and exit 
ramps, crosswalks and intersections, immediately upstream and downstream of bridges, side streets 
at intersections, the end of channels in cut sections, behind curbs, shoulders or sidewalks to drain low 
areas, and where necessary to collect snowmelt and not in areas where pedestrian traffc is expected. 
The inlet spacing should be calculated on the basis of the collection of runoff. Inlets should be 
frst located from the crest working downgrade to the sag point by calculating the distance of the 
frst inlet from the crest and then computing the distances of the other successive inlets. The dis￾tance of the frst inlet from the crest is calculated as follows: 
10 000Q L = , t
6.4 0.0028CiW
where 
L is the distance of the frst inlet from the crest, m 
Qt
 is the maximum allowable fow, m3/s 
C is the composite runoff coeffcient for contributing drainage area 
W is the width of contributing drainage area, m 
i is the rainfall intensity for design frequency, mm/h 
6.5 SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE SYSTEM 
Subsurface drainage involves providing a subsurface system to remove subsurface water. This water 
can be from any of the following: 
1. Water coming from nearby groundwater 
2. Water infltrating the surface layers through voids and/or cracks 
3. Water seeping up from artesian aquifers 
4. Water resulting from the thawing of ice lenses in soil layers 
6.5.1 GROUNDWATER 
Groundwater fuctuations can cause ingress of water, but generally the water table is low or lowered 
enough so as to avoid its effects. For cases where the groundwater table does need to be considered 
for seepage of water into the pavement, the following method can be used to estimate the infow.

Refer to the general case illustrated in Figure 6.10. 
Step 1. Determine the parameter, Li
, radius of infuence: Li = 3.8(H − H0). 
Step 2. Estimate q1, infow from above the bottom of the drainage layer: 
k H˛ ˝ ° H0 q1 ˜ 6.5 2Li
where k is the permeability of the soil in the cut slope. 
Step 3. Determine the parameter, (Li+ 0.5 W)/H0. 
Step 4. Determine the parameter, W/H0. 
Step 5. Use the chart in Figure 6.11 to estimate the parameter: k(H− H0)/2q2. 
Step 6. Knowing k, permeability of the soil in the subgrade, H, and H0, determine q2, the seep￾age infow from the bottom of the drainage layer. 
Step 7. Determine the total lateral infow into the drainage pipe: qd = q1+ q2, for collector pipes 
on both sides, and qd = 2(q1+ q2), for a collector pipe on one side of the pavement only. 
Step 8. Determine the groundwater infow into the drainage layer per unit area: qg = 2q2/W, 
for pavement sloped on both sides and collector pipes on both sides, and qg = (q1+2q2)/W, for 
pavement sloped on one side with a collector pipe on one side. 
6.5.2 WATER ENTERING THROUGH CRACKS 
Water enters a pavement system through cracks and joints in the pavement surface or between the 
pavement and the shoulder, as well as in the shoulder and side ditches. The common method to 
determine the infltration rate in an uncracked pavement is to use the following equation: 
˛Nc Wc ˆ
qi ˜ Ic ˙ ° ˘ ° kp 6.6 ˝ W WCs ˇ
where 
qi
 is the rate of pavement infltration, m3/day/m2 (ft3/day/ft2
) 
Ic is the crack infltration rate, m3/day/m (ft3/day/ft); suggested value, (Ic) = 0.223 m3/day/m, 2.4 ft3/ 
day/ft of crack (Ridgeway, 1976) 
Nc is the number of longitudinal cracks 
Wc is the length of contributing transverse joints or cracks, m (ft) 
W is the width of permeable base, m (ft) 
Cs is the spacing of contributing transverse joints or cracks, m (ft)

kp is the pavement permeability, m/day (ft/day); suggested permeability of uncracked speci￾mens of asphalt pavement (AC) after being subjected to traffc and Portland Cement Concrete 
pavement (PCC) are on the order of 1 × 10−9 cm/s (15 × 10−5 ft/day) (Barber and Sawyer, 
1952).

6.5.3 ARTESIAN AQUIFERS 
For seepage of water from artesian aquifers, the following equation is used to estimate the infow: 
°H
qa ˜ K 6.7 H0
where 
qa is the infow from artesian source, ft3/day/ft2 of drainage area 
ΔH is the excess hydraulic head, ft 
H0 is the thickness of the subgrade soil between the drainage layer and the artesian aquifer, ft 
K is the coeffcient of permeability, ft/day 
6.5.4 MELTING SNOW 
Melting of snow and ice also contributes to water fow inside the pavement. Moulton’s chart 
(Figure 6.12) can be used to estimate the infow. 
The required parameters are overburden pressure that can be determined from the density of 
the materials in the layer above this layer, the permeability of the subgrade material, as well as the 
frost susceptibility of the soil. The average rate of heave can be determined experimentally or from 
Moulton’s table (Table 6.4).

6.6 DESIGN OF SUBSURFACE DRAINAGE STRUCTURES 
In general, the subsurface drainage system consists of a drainage layer in the subsurface part of 
the pavement and side drainage channels—the drainage layer of high-permeability material slopes 
away on both sides to intercept subsurface water and direct it sideways to drainage channels. It is 
important to provide flters in the drainage layer and channels that remove water and water only 
and do not let fner soil particles wash out with the water. The various components are shown in 
Figure 6.13. 
For rigid pavements, there is a separator layer between the subgrade (to prevent migration of 
fnes) and the permeable base over which the PCC layer is placed. In asphalt pavements, the perme￾able base layer is placed under adequate thickness of the asphalt mix layer. 
The resultant slope of the permeable base is given by the following:

SR is the resultant slope, ft/ft

The steps in designing a drainage system for pavements consist of determining the amount of water, 
designing a permeable base and the separation layer, determining the fow to edge drains and spac￾ing of outfows, and checking the outlet fow. 
The coeffcient of permeability, k, is an important factor and is primarily dictated by effective 
grain size, D10, porosity, n, and the percentage passing the 0.075mm sieve. The addition of stabilizer 
such as asphalt or Portland cement can counterbalance the effect of replacing the fne aggregate 
portion and the loss in stability. 
Although k can be determined in the laboratory, quite commonly k is estimated from empirical 
equations such as the following: 
k C= kD10
2 6.10 
where 
k is the permeability, cm/s 
D10 is the effective grain size corresponding to size passing 10% 
Ck is the Hazen’s coeffcient, 0.8–1.2 
Another equation proposed by Moulton (1980) is as follows: 
1.478 6.654 ˛6 214 °105 D10 . ˝ n
k ˜ 6.11 0.597 P200
where 
n is the porosity 
P200 is the percentage passing No. 200 sieve 
6.9 
ISTUDY 
134 Pavement Engineering 
The void ratio or porosity has a signifcant effect on k and the amount of water that can stay within 
the soil; this is important because all of the water within a soil cannot be removed since some of 
the water remains as thin flm. The porosity that is effective in determining how much water can be 
removed is called the effective porosity. 
The total porosity, or porosity, is defned as follows: 
Vv n = 6.12 VT
where 
VT is the total volume 
Vv is the volume of voids 
Vv = VT − VS 
VS is the volume of solid 
˛ V

If a test is conducted to determine the volume of water draining under gravity from a known volume 
of material, then the effective porosity can be computed as follows: 
Ve ne = 6.17 VT
where Ve is the volume of water draining under gravity. 
If WL is the water loss percentage—that is, water drained from the sample—then the effective 
porosity can be expressed as follows (FHWA, 1992): 
nWL ne = 6.18

6.6.1 DESIGN OF PERMEABLE BASE 
The permeable base can be designed according to one of the two available methods. The Moulton 
(1979) method is based on the idea that the thickness of the base should be equal to or greater than 
the depth of the fow, which means that the steady fow capacity of the base should be equal to or 
greater than the rate of infow. The design equations are as follows: 
k is the permeability 
S is the slope 
LR is the length of drainage 
qi
 is the rate of uniform infow 
H1 is the depth of water at the upper end of the fow path

The equations can be solved with the use of a chart (Figure 6.14). The chart can be used to deter￾mine the maximum depth of fow, or the required k of the material, when the other parameters are 
known. The use of the chart is based on the assumption that H1 equals Hmax, which is the maximum 
depth of the fow.

The second approach is based on the concept of time to drain, specifcally 50% drainage in

6.6.1.1 Materials for Permeable Base 
The time to drain of a soil depends primarily on its coeffcient of permeability, which is primarily 
dependent on the aggregate gradation. Gradations of typical materials (as suggested by FHWA, 
1999) are given in Table 6.6, Table 6.7, and Table 6.8. Generally materials with permeability exceed￾ing 1,000 ft/day are used for highways.

6.6.2 DESIGN OF SEPARATOR OR FILTER LAYER 
The separator layer can be made up of aggregates or a geotextile layer. The functions of this layer 
include preventing pumping of fnes from the subgrade to the permeable base, providing a stable plat￾form to facilitate the construction of the overlying layers, directing water infltrating from above to 
the side drains or edge drains and preventing it from entering the subgrade, and distributing the loads 
over the subgrade without defecting excessively. Separator layers with aggregates range in thickness 
from 4 to 12in. and can provide the stable construction platform as well as distribute loads over the 
subgrade without defecting. Generally, geotextiles are used over stabilized subgrades. The separator 
layer should be such that subgrade fnes do not move up to the separator layer and the fnes from the 
separator layer do not move into the permeable base. The following requirements must be met. 
D15 (separator layer) ≤ 5D85 (subgrade) 
D50 (separator layer) ≤ 25D50 (subgrade) 
D15 (base) ≤ 5D85 (separator layer) 
D50 (base) ≤ 25D50 (separator layer) 
The requirements of the aggregate separator layer are as follows: 
1. Should have durable, crushed, angular aggregate 
2. Maximum Los Angeles abrasion loss of 50% (see Chapter 8) 
3. Maximum soundness of 12% or 18% loss as determined by the sodium sulfate or magne￾sium sulfate tests (see Chapter 8) 
4. Density should be at least 95% of the maximum density 
5. Maximum percentage of materials passing the No. 200 sieve is 12% 
6. Coeffcient of uniformity is between 20 and 40. 
Examples of typical gradations used by state highway agencies are provided in Table 6.9. 
6.6.2.1 Geotextile Separator Layer 
The requirements for geotextile separators have been set as follows (FHWA, 1998): 
AOSor O95 (geotextile) ≤BD85 (soil) 6.26 
where 
AOS is the apparent opening size, mm 
O95 is the opening size in the geotextile for which 95% are smaller, mm 
AOS ≈ O95 
B is the dimensionless coeffcient 
D85 is the soil particle size for which 85% are smaller, mm

6.6.3 DESIGN OF EDGE DRAINS 
Guidelines from FHWA (1992) can be used for the design of edge drains. Generally, the edge drains 
are designed to handle the peak fow coming from the permeable base: 
Q Q˜ °p o L ˜ (kSx o H)L 6.28 
where 
Q is the pipe fow capacity, m3/day (ft3/day) 
Qp is the design pavement discharge rate, m3/day/m (ft3/day/ft) 
Lo is the outlet spacing, m (ft) 
k is the permeability of granular layer, m3/day (ft3/day) 
Sx is the transverse slope, m/m (ft/ft) 
H is the thickness of granular layer, m (ft) 
ISTUDYDrainage 141 
For designs based on the pavement infltration fow rate, the design fow capacity of the edge drain 
is as follows: 
Q Q˜ °p o L ˜(q Wi )Lo 6.29 
where 
qi
 is the pavement infltration, m3/day/m2 (ft3/day/ft2
) 
W is the width of the granular layer, m (ft) 
For designs based on the average fow to drain the permeable base, the design fow capacity is as 
follows: 
˛ ˛ 24 ˆˆ Q Q
where 
ne is the effective porosity of granular material 
U is the percentage drainage (as 1% = 0.01) 
t is the time for drainage, U, to be reached, days 
The pipe for the edge drain is designed according to the Manning’s coeffcient (Daugherty and 
˜
Ingersoll, 1954): 
Q = K 1 2/ 2 3 S R / A 6.31 
n
where 
Q is the pipe fow capacity, m3/s 
S is the slope of the pipe invert, m/m n is the pipe coeffcient of roughness (0.012 for smooth pipe, 
and 0.024 for corrugated pipe; FHWA, 1992) 
A is the pipe cross-sectional area, m2 
K = 1 
R = A/P = D/4, m 
P is the wetted perimeter of pipe, m

ISTUDY142 Pavement Engineering 
The equations are generally used to determine the spacing of the pipes by fxing a specifc type of 
pipe with a specifc diameter. This is done by setting the pipe capacity equal to the discharge from 
the unit length of the pavement times the distance between the pipe outlets (spacing). 
For infltration fow: 
Q Lo = 6.34 (q W) i
For peak fow: 
Q Lo = 6.35 kSxH
For average fow: 
(Q t) Lo = (24WHneU)
The spacing generally used is 250–300 ft. Pipe diameters and spacing are usually determined in 
consideration of maintenance requirements. 
A flter layer in the form of geotextiles (or, less commonly, aggregates of different gradations) 
could be wrapped around the pipe or used as an envelope to the edge drains to prevent the infow of 
adjacent soil into the pipes but allow the free fow of water into them; if slotted pipes are used, the 
flter material must be such that the adjacent soil does not enter the pipes. 
Koerner and Hwu (1991) recommend requirements of prefabricated edge drain flters (Table 6.10). 
It is recommend (NCHRP, 1994) that geocomposite edge drains should be placed on the shoulder 
side, and the pavement side should be backflled with suitable sand. The outlet drainpipe is selected 
to make sure that the capacity is equal to or greater than the capacity of the edge drain. 
Recommendations (FHWA, 1992) regarding edge drains and outlets are as follows: 
1. The preferable location of the edge drain is under the shoulder just adjacent to the pave￾ment/shoulder joint with the top of the pipe at the bottom of the layer to be drained in a 
12-in. trench. 
2. The flter fabric could be provided at the subbase-edge drain interface to prevent clogging 
of the flter by fnes, and the trench backfll material should have adequate permeability. 
3. Outlet spacing should be less than 500 ft, with additional outlets at the bottom of vertical 
sags; rigid PVC outlets are desirable along with headwalls to protect it, prevent erosion, 
and help in locating the outlets.

6.7 CONSIDERATION OF DRAINAGE IN PAVEMENT DESIGN 
Note that the effect of the quality of the drainage system provided in a pavement structure should 
be considered in its structural design. The basic idea is that if there is a good drainage system that 
removes water quickly from the pavement structure, then the total pavement structure will be thin￾ner than in the case where a good drainage system is not provided. For example, in the current 
AASHTO design procedure, “drainage coeffcients” are recommended to be used according to the 
quality of drainage provided. Figure 6.16 explains the steps, which include determination of the 
(From American Association of State Highway and Transportation Offcials [AASHTO], AASHTO Guide for Design of 
Pavement Structures, AASHTO, Washington, DC, 1993).

6.8 PUMPING IN RIGID PAVEMENTS 
Pumping is defned as the ejection of material from underneath the PCC slab as a result of water 
pressure. Water accumulated underneath a PCC slab will pressurize when the slab defects under 
traffc loads. The source of the ejected material can be from the base or subgrade. To initiate the 
pumping process, a small void space needs to be created beneath the slab. This could occur by 
the compression of plastic soil or due to warping of the PCC slab at the joint area. A free-draining 
soil will not accumulate the necessary water. A fne soil-water suspension underneath the slab 
is formed and aids in the ejection of the soil. After repeated cycles of slab defection and ejected 
soil-water suspension, a larger void space is created underneath the slab. At this stage faulting is 
observed and eventually cracking and corner breaks could occur if signifcantly higher stresses 
are developed in the PCC slab. To minimize pumping, pump-susceptible soils such as clays and 
high-plasticity fne grained soils should be avoided. Free-draining bases and erosion-resistant 
bases are highly recommended. A source of water is essential for pumping to occur. Water could 
be provided by the presence of a high water table, poorly functioning joint seals, or cracks in the 
PCC slab. In any event, a well-draining base could greatly decrease the potential for pumping 
distress. 
6.9 USE OF SOFTWARE FOR DESIGN OF DRAINAGE STRUCTURES 
Figure 6.17 explains the step-by-step procedures for the use of the Drainage Requirement in 
Pavements (DRIP) software for the design of a drainage system for an example pavement (DRIP 
User’s Guide, FHWA, 2002; also see Drainage Analysis and Modeling Programs [DAMP], FHWA, 
1990); Figure 6.18 shows the screenshots for the example. DRIP, version 2 can be downloaded from 
https://me-design.com/medesign/DRIP.html. 
Problem
A pavement section consists of two 12-ft (3.66-m) lanes of 9-in.- (225-mm-) thick PCC pavement with 10-ft 
(3.05-m) AC shoulders on each side with a uniform cross slope (not crowned), and the width of the perme￾able base is the same as the PCC pavement. The transverse joint spacing is 20 ft (6.1 m). The slope in both the 
longitudinal (S) and transverse (Sx) directions is 2%. The permeable base is made up of AASHTO #57 materi￾al and has a unit weight of 100 pcf (1600 kg/m3), specific gravity of 2.65, and a minimum permeability of 3000 
ft/day (914 m/day). The thickness of the permeable base is 4 in. (100 mm), based on construction consider￾ations. Assume a unit weight of 162 pcf (2595 kg/m3) for the PCC material. The subgrade is Georgia Red Clay, 
which is actually a well-graded clayey-silt. Laboratory tests indicate the particle gradation for the subgrade 
material as follows: 92%, 67%, 55%, 42% and 31% passing the No. 4, 10, 20, 50 and 200 sieve, respectively, and 
a permeability of 0.0033 ft/day (0.001 m/day). Corrugated pipe edgedrains having 4-in. (100-mm) diameter 
are used on the project. 
Solution
Step 1: Select unit (English), and Mode (Normal), Sensitivity (Length, Slope, Permeability, Inflow, Drain, 
Thickness, porosity), Plot Scale (Power 0.45) (Figure 6.18a) 
FIGURE 6.17 Flowchart for solving an example problem with DRIP. 
(Adapted from DRIP User’s Guide, FHWA, 2002). 
ISTUDY 
Moulton’s meltwater chart appears on the screen (Figure 6.18d). On this screen a horizontal redline 
appears marking the heave rate of the subgrade (in mm/day for 0.51 in./day). Use the mouse to slide the 
vertical tick line along the horizontal red line (0.51 in./day line) to an approximate location for a stress 
of 154.8 psf. The value for qm, 0.05 will appear in the appropriate box. When satisfied that the mouse is 
positioned at the proper stress value, click the left mouse button to produce a computed value of qm 
(0.05 ft3/day/ft2) 
Step 2: Enter information for roadway geometry (Figure 6.18b): Enter the value of b as 24 ft (2 lanes of 12 ft 
each). Since the problem statement assumes that the width of the permeable base is same as that of the PCC 
layer, enter the value of c as 0. Clicking the calculator icon for width of the permeable base W results in a 
computed value of 24 ft. Enter the longitudinal and transverse slopes in the S and SX edit boxes, respectively. 
Click the calculator icons for both SR (resultant slope) and LR (resultant length) to compute these parameters. 
The calculations should yield the following values: SR = 0.0283 ft/ft and LR = 33.94 ft/ft. Select a uniformly 
cross-sloped pavement section by clicking on the Geometry B radio button. 
Step 3: Enter information for inflow: 
Click on the Crack Infiltration Method radio button (since this method was required to be chosen to estimate 
inflow). Retain the default values of 2.4 ft3/day/ft for Ic and 0 for pavement permeability kp. Also retain the 
values for Wc and W that have been automatically carried forward from the calculations performed on the 
Roadway Geometry page. Enter the number of longitudinal cracks, Nc, as 3 (Nc = the number of contributing 
lanes + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3). Enter the given transverse spacing of contributing transverse joints Cs = 20 ft. Click the 
calculator icon to compute inflow qi
. This should yield a value of 0.42ft3/day/ft2 
Step 4: (Continuing information for Inflow): meltwater computation 
Activate the Meltwater sub-screen in the Inflow property page by clicking on the “Include Meltwater in the 
inflow calculations” checkbox. The heave rate (Heave) for the clayey-silt subgrade soil can be determined by 
clicking on the calculator button located to the left of the variable. This action calls up the heave rate table 
(Figure 6.18c). The heave rate table shows that the value for clayey silt soil is 0.51 in./day. This value can 
either be entered manually in the edit box on the Meltwater sub-screen or entered automatically by selecting 
the row corresponding to clayey-silt soil type. For materials with large heave rates, the mid-point values may 
be entered. Enter the given values for the subgrade permeability (ksub = 0.0033 ft/day), unit weight of the 
pavement surface (£p = 162 lb/ft3), the unit weight of the base material above the subgrade (£b = 100 lb/ft3), 
the thickness of pavement surface (Hs = 9 in., 0.75 ft.), and the thickness of the base material (H = 4 in., 0.33 
ft.) in the appropriate boxes. Click on the calculator icon next to the variable ¤ to compute the stress imposed 
by the pavement on the subgrade. This will yield a value of 154.5 lb/ft2 . Click the calculator icon for determin￾ing the quantity of meltwater (qm). 
Step 5: Enter information for Permeable Base (design using depth of Flow method): 
Select the Permeable Base tab to access the corresponding property page. Click on the Depth of Flow Method 
radio button. Most of the variables such as qi + qm, SR, LR, and H already have values carried forward from 
pervious screens. The term qi + qm is a summation of the inflow from rainfall and meltwater. Enter the 
coefficient of permeability of the base (k = 3000 ft/day). Compute the Hmin by clicking on the calculator icon. 
A Hmin value of 0.1437 ft is reported, which is lower than the selected permeable base thickness (H) of 0.3333 
ft. Therefore, the design is satisfied. If Hmin were much greater than H, the designer would make adjustments 
to the design by changing design variables such as base thickness or permeability. If the base thickness H can 
be revised, this parameter must be changed to be at least equal to the Hmin. Compute flow capacity of the 
permeable base (qd) by clicking on the appropriate calculator button. This yields a value of 44 ft3/day/ft. The 
flow capacity is estimated from Moulton’s chart (Figure 6.18f).

Additional discussion on depth of flow design 
If the user wishes to perform a sensitivity analysis to see the influence of different parameters on the required 
thickness, the graph icon to the right of Hmin variable in Figure 6.17f can be clicked. DRIP internally performs 
the calculations over a pre-selected range of the independent parameter (in this case the required base 
thickness) and computes and plots the dependent variables. The charts are plotted using the DripPlot. The 
DripPlot window appears as soon as the graph icon next to the Hmin variable is clicked and the following 
sensitivity plots are displayed: (Figure 6.18g) 
• Required Base Thickness (Hmin) vs. Pavement Inflow (qi
 or qi
 + qm). 
• Required Base Thickness (Hmin) vs. Base Course Permeability (k). 
• Required Base Thickness (Hmin) vs. Resultant Slope (SR). 
• Required Base Thickness (Hmin) vs. Resultant Length (LR). 
The user can control the type of plots to be displayed in the DripPlot window using the Options | Sensitivity 
menu command prior to clicking the graph icon. 
Step 8: Review input and output by clicking on File ˜ Export Summary (Figure 6.18m) 
Step 7: Enter information for Edgedrain (design): 
Select the Edgedrain tab. Select the Pipe Edgedrain radio button. Click the “Corrugated” checkbox and a 
value of nmanning = 0.024 is displayed. Type in a value of D = 4 in. The calculator icon is enabled for calculating 
the pipe capacity (Q). The computed pipe capacity should read 12,594 ft3/day. Click on the Lo button to 
compute the outlet spacing. This gives an Lo value of 391.6 ft. However, this value is based on the default 
selection of the Pavement Infiltration method for the pavement discharge rate. Two other methods are given 
to compute the maximum outlet spacing: Permeable Base and Time-to-Drain. Since the time-to-drain 
method was not used for designing the permeable base we will not examine this approach. For computing the 
outlet spacing Lo based on the Permeable Base approach, select the appropriate radio button from the 
“Discharge Rate Approach” options. Our previously computed base discharge qd of 44.81 ft3/day/ft appears 
automatically. This results in a maximum outlet spacing of 281 ft. Thus, the permeable base discharge result 
is the critical value, so the user should specify an outlet spacing of 281 ft (Figure 6.18l). 
Step 6: Enter information for separator layer (Design): 
Select the Separator Layer tab. Select the No Separator radio button to evaluate the need for a separator layer. 
Click on the calculator icon next to the Base Course variable. This shifts the user to the Sieve Analysis proper￾typage. (Figure 6.18h.) The permeable base is made up of the AASHTO #57 material. The gradation for this 
material is already in the sieve analysis library. To initialize this gradation to the program, click on the 
dropdown material library list box and select AASHTO #57. Click on the calculator icon to determine the 
particle sizes for D15 and D50. Select the Separator Layer tab again. The values of D15 = 0.2529 in. and D50 = 
0.5484 in. appear for the Base Course. Click on the calculator icon next the Subgrade variable to compute the 
subgrade particle sizes. The user is returned to the Sieve Analysis property page again and the Subgrade radio 
button is automatically activated (Figure 6.18i). Select the Value radio button and enter the subgrade 
gradation in the grid on the left-hand side of the property page. Compute the D50 and D85 by clicking on the 
particle size calculator icon. Return to the separator layer property page by selecting the Separator tab. The 
values of D50 = 0.0253 in. and D85 = 0.1498 in. are returned for the subgrade (Figure 6.18j). On the Sieve 
Analysis property page, check the filtration and uniformity criteria at the subgrade/base interface by clicking 
on the balance icon on the right-hand side. Both the criteria generate a Pass rating, which implies that no 
separator layer is required (Figure 6.18k).

7 Soil 
7.1 OVERVIEW 
Soil can be defned as unconsolidated earth material composed of discrete particles with gas or 
liquids between a relatively loose agglomeration of mineral and organic materials and sediments 
found above bedrock or any earth material except embedded shale and rock. 
The classifcation on the basis of particle size and gradation gives three groups of soils: coarse 
grained or granular soils consisting of sands and gravels; fne grained or cohesive soils consisting of 
clay; and silts, which lie in between. 
The dominant factors for the coarse grained soils are mass or gravitational forces between par￾ticles and that water has very little or no infuence. For fne grained soils, electrical and chemical 
forces dominate particle interaction, and the amount and nature of pore fuid (such as water) affect 
the particle interaction signifcantly. 
Particle size and gradation are important factors for coarse grained soils. Uniform gradation 
means the soils consist of predominantly one size and should have a high permeability. Well graded 
means the presence of different sizes in suffcient proportions, which results in higher density and 
strength. Gap graded means there is an absence of certain sizes of particles in the soil. 
Mineralogy also has a signifcant infuence on the properties of the soil, more so in the case of the 
clay particles than in the case of coarse grained soil. Coarse grained soils mostly consist of siliceous 
materials with quartz and feldspar particles. 
The physical properties that characterize clay particles are that they are very small, platy, and 
negatively charged. There are three primary clay minerals (Figure 7.1). Kaolinite ranges in size 
from 0.5 to 5 μm. The specifc surface area (particle surface area/particle mass) ranges from 10 
to 20 m2/g. In comparison, the specifc surface of silt-size particles is less than 1m2/g. Kaolinite 
has a stable structure with strong bonds and is electrically almost neutral. The electrical activity is 
expressed by its cation exchange capacity, which for Kaolinite is 3–10 meq/100 g. Illite ranges in 
size from 0.1 to 2 μm with a specifc surface of 80–100 m2/g. It has a moderately stable structure 
with a cation exchange capacity of 10–40 meq/100 g. Montmorillonite ranges in size from 0.1 to 
1 μm with a specifc surface of approximately 800 m2/g. It has an unstable structure with a cation 
exchange capacity of 80–120 meq/g. 
Water is bound to negatively charged clay particles (hydrated), and the absorbed cations (Li+, 
Na++, Mg++, Ca+) infuence the nature of the bound water layer. The bound water infuences particle 
interaction. 
7.2 SOILS IN SUBGRADE

1. Grain size distribution (through sieve analysis) 
2. Specifc gravity 
3. Atterberg limits 
4. Organic content 
5. Moisture retention and hydraulic conductivity 
6. Compaction 
7. Frost susceptibility

Classifcation of the subgrade soil type and approximate judgment regarding the usability of the 
material can be made according to the American Association of Highway and Transportation Offcials 
(AASHTO) and the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM). Subgrade soils (henceforth 
called soils) that are used for pavements can be primarily of two types—coarse grained (sands and 
gravel) and fne grained (silts and clays). Organic soils such as peat are generally not used in pavement 
subgrade. Tests are carried out on subgrade soils for characterization to select the proper materials, to 
develop specifcations and hence quality control guidelines, and for estimation of properties such as mod￾ulus, which can be used in the structural design procedure for determination of responses under load. 
The starting point in characterizing the subgrade soil is the development of a boring/coring location plan 
based on existing soil maps. The soil samples are then tested in the laboratory for the different properties. 
7.3 MASS-VOLUME RELATIONSHIPS 
Any soil mass typically consists of three materials or “phases”—solid soil particles (or solid), water, 
and air. The relative proportions of these components greatly infuence the other physical properties 
and load-carrying capacity of soils. Therefore, several parameters have been defned that help us 
determine one or two important parameters if a set of other parameters is known. Generally, a phase 
or block diagram is used to solve for such parameters. The parameters and different formulas are 
shown in Figure 7.2. It is important to note that these parameters help us to convert volume to mass 
and mass to volume, which is required for the estimation of materials during construction.

7.4 GRAIN SIZE DISTRIBUTION: GRADATION 
The grain size distribution or gradation of soil is one of its most important properties. A handful 
of soil from the ground would show us that the mass consists of particles of different sizes. The 
relative proportion of the particles of different sizes is very important in determining the soil’s 
load-carrying capacity. The method to determine this proportion is called particle size analysis. 
In this procedure, particles of different sizes are mechanically separated by passing the soil 
through a stack of sieves with progressively decreasing size openings from top to bottom. The dry 
weight of the soil in each sieve is then determined and through a few steps the percentage pass￾ing each sieve is determined and plotted against the logarithm of sieve size opening. Generally 
the data are plotted (as a gradation curve) with the percentage passing in arithmetic scale in the 
y-axis and the sieve sizes in logarithmic scale in the x-axis. Note that the gradation of the soil is 
used in classifcation as well as indicators of different engineering properties, as mentioned later 
in this chapter. 
For testing, either standard AASHTO 88 or ASTM D 422 can be used. The sieve sizes are 
selected on the basis of samples or specifcations, and the particle size analysis of soil particles pass￾ing the 2.0 mm sieve can be conducted using a hydrometer. Particles retained on a 0.075 mm sieve 
after hydrometer tests should also be subjected to sieve analysis, and then all of the results should 
be combined to produce one combined gradation plot for the soil. The data are analyzed as shown in 
Figure 7.3. 
The hydrometer analysis is conducted on the principle of Stokes’ law, which relates the terminal 
velocity of a particle falling freely in a liquid to its diameter, as follows: 
2 D ˙w ˛Gs ° GL ˝ v ˜ 7.8 18ˆ
where 
v is the velocity of settling soil particles 
D is the diameter of particle 
γw is the unit weight of water 
Gs is the specifc gravity of solid particles 
GL is the specifc gravity of soil-water mixture 
η is the dynamic viscosity of soil-water mixture

The soil sample is suspended in water in a cylinder using a dispersing agent such as sodium hexam￾etaphosphate. The hydrometer, with a graduated scale on it, is then placed inside the liquid, and 
hydrometer readings are taken at the end of 120 s, and then at time intervals such as 5, 15, 30, 60, 
250, and 1440 min as particles continues to settle (sedimentation) down in the liquid. The two equa￾tions used for the determination of percentage fner and diameters of the particle are as follows:

Depending on the gradation, the soil can be classifed as poorly graded (short range of sizes), well

7.5 EFFECTS OF WATER 
The presence of certain types of soil materials, such as clay, can cause the effects of water to be sig￾nifcant and may make the soil unsuitable for use in pavement subgrade. As the water content of the 
soil increases from very low to high, the soil properties change. The Atterberg limit parameters— 
the liquid limit, plastic limit, and plasticity index (PI) of a soil—tell us how sensitive the soil is to 
the effect of water. 
Shrinkage limit: Shrinkage limit is defned as the maximum calculated water content, at 
which a reduction in water content will not cause a decrease in the volume of the soil 
mass. AASHTO T 92 can be used for determination of shrinkage limit (SL). 
Plastic limit: Plastic limit (PL) is the moisture content below which the soil is nonplastic. 
Experimental defnition: Plastic limit is defned as the water content at which a soil thread 
crumbles when it is rolled down to a diameter of 3 mm (approximately): 
˝ °massof water˛ ˇ
Plastic limit ˆ
ˆ˙
˜  100%
˘ °massof oven dry soil˛
The AASHTO T 90 procedure is used for the determination of the plastic limit of the soils. 
Liquid limit: Liquid limit (LL) is the moisture content below which the soil behaves as a plastic 
material. Liquid limit is defned as the water content at which a part of soil placed in a brass 
cup, cut with a standard groove, and then dropped from a height of 1cm will undergo a groove 
closure of 12.7mm when dropped 25 times. A nearly linear plot of the water content (%) versus 
a log of the number of blows (N) is prepared. The moisture content corresponding to 25 blows is 
the liquid limit. The AASHTO T 89 procedure is used for the determination of liquid limit.

The following observations were obtained from a liquid limit test of a soil:
Number of blows: 10, 20, 31, 40.
Moisture content: 82.0%, 74.3%, 68.0%, 65.0%.
Two tests for plastic limit were done that gave values of 28.2 and 29.4, respectively.
Determine liquid limit and PI of the soil.
Plot the moisture content versus number of blows data as shown in Figure 7.6, with the

an arithmetic scale.
From Figure 7.6, LL = 71%.

One can use this system to classify soil and make a conclusion regarding its suitability as sub￾grade soil. The criteria for the AASHTO classifcation system are based on performance as highway 
construction material. There are two general groups—coarse grained and fne grained (or granular 
and cohesive). The distinction between coarse and fne grained soil is 35% passing the No. 200 
sieve. There is also organic soil. 
The groups range from A1 (best), which is the coarsest grained, to A8 (worst), which is the fnest 
grained. The parameter used for grouping is called the group index (GI), which rates soil as a pave￾ment subgrade material, as shown in Table 7.2: 
TABLE 7.2 
Rating of Soil on the Basis of Group Index 
Group Index (GI) Subgrade Rating 
0 Excellent 
0–1 Good 
2–4 Fair 
5–9 Poor 
10–20 Very poor 
The steps in classifcation consist of the following: 
1. Use grain size distribution and Atterberg limits data to assign a group classifcation system 
and a GI. 
2. Compute the GI using the following equation: 
GI ˜ F ° 35 ˆ
ˇ0 2 ˙ 0 005 LL ° 40 ˘
 ˛ ˝ . . ˛ ˝ ˙ 0 0. 1˛F °15˝˛PI °10˝
where 
F is the portion passing No. 200 sieve 
LL is the liquid limit 
PI is the plasticity index 
Express the GI as a whole number. 
A GI value of less than zero should be reported as zero. 
For A-2-6 or A-2-7 soils, use only the second term for the calculation of the GI. 
3. Express the AASHTO soil classifcation as the group classifcation followed by the GI in 
parentheses.

Plasticity tests: LL = 48%, PL = 26%. 
Determine the classifcation of the soil, and state whether this material is suitable in its 
natural state for use as a subbase material. 
Refer to Table 7.1. Since the percentage passing the No. 200 sieve is 69, the soil must be a 
silt-clay material. The LL is 48%; therefore, it should fall in either the A-5 or A-7 category. 
The PI = LL− PL = 22> 10, so it must be an A-7 soil. In this case, LL − 30 = 18; PI > (LL − 
30); therefore, the soil can be classifed as an A-7-6 material. 
GI = (69 − 35)[0.2 + 0.005 (48 − 40)] + 0.01(69 − 5)(22 − 10) = 14.6 (very poor) 
Conclusion: unsuitable as a subbase material in its natural state.

7.6.2 UNIFIED SOIL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (ASTM) 
The frst step in this system is to determine if the soil is highly organic (has a dark brown, gray, 
or black color; has an odor; is soft; and has fbrous materials) or not. If yes, it is classifed as 
ISTUDYSoil 167 
 
peat, and if not, the soil is subjected to particle size analysis and the gradation curve is plotted. 
The group symbols for fne grained soils are shown in Table 7.4. Based on the percentage of weight 
passing the 3-in., No. 4, and No. 200 sieves, the percentages of gravel, sand, and fnes are com￾puted on the basis of Table 7.5. If less than 100% of the material passes through a 3-in. sieve, 
then base the classifcation on the basis of the percentage of the material that passes through the 
3-in. sieve and note the percentage of cobbles and/or boulders. If 100% passes the 3-in. sieve, 
then check the percentage passing the No. 200 sieve—if 5% or more passes the No. 200 sieve, 
then determine liquid and plastic limits. Check whether more than 50% passes through the No. 
200 sieve—if it does (fne grained soil), then follow subsequent instructions for fne grained 
soils; otherwise (coarse grained soil) follow the instructions for coarse grained soils. 
Fine grained soils are primarily silt and/or clay, and Figure 7.7 should be used for classifcation. 
The soils falling above the A line are classifed as clays, and those falling below are classifed as 
silts. 
The tests needed to determine if a soil is organic are those that test the liquid limit on an unmodi￾fed and an oven-dried sample. The soil is considered to be organic if the liquid limit after oven 
drying is < 75% of the original. For classifcation of inorganic soils, use Figure 7.7 and Figure 7.8. 
For classifcation of organic soils, use Figure 7.7 and Figure 7.9. 
Coarse soils are primarily sand and/or gravel. The symbols for coarse grained soils are shown 
in Table 7.4. 
Use Figure 7.10 to classify coarse grained soils according to the following guidelines: 
1. Use two-letter groups to describe soils with < 5% passing the No. 200 sieve. 
2. Use four-letter groups to describe gradation and type of fnes for soils with 5%–12% pass￾ing the No. 200 sieve. 
3. Use two-letter symbols to describe the fnes for soils with > 12% passing the No. 200 
sieve. Plasticity index, Ip

7.7 DENSITY AND OPTIMUM MOISTURE CONTENT 
Compacting loose soil is the simplest way to improve its load-bearing capacity. Water is added to 
the soil, which is compacted in lifts, to lubricate the soil particles and aid in the compaction process. 
As water is added to the soil, the density of the soil increases due to compaction. However, beyond a 
certain water content, even though the soil becomes more workable, the unit weight of the soil will 
decrease. This is shown in Figure 7.11. 
This can be explained by the fact that beyond the “optimum” water content, the water cannot 
force its way into trapped air pockets, so it takes up the space originally taken by the soil solids— 
that is, it separates the soil particles and causes a corresponding decrease in density. 
Generally, the density of the soil solids (generally referred to as dry density) is taken as an 
indicator of the load-carrying capacity of the soil and as an indicator of the degree of compaction 
of the soil—a higher density relates to a higher stiffness and/or strength. Moreover, a high density 
also ensures low permeability and minimizes settlement and volume changes due to frost action, 
swelling, and shrinkage. A high density of the solids can be achieved in the feld only by applying 
compactive effort (through rollers) and moisture. To achieve this, it is important to determine in the 
laboratory the “optimum” moisture content of the soil—the word optimum here refers to that mois￾ture content which produces the highest dry density for a given compactive effort. In soils with 10% 
or more passing the No. 200 sieve, the change in dry density versus the change in moisture content 
can be expressed in the form of the curve shown in Figure 7.11. The moisture content corresponding 
to the maximum dry unit weight is called the optimum moisture content. 
Note that the moisture content versus dry density curve is different for different compactive 
efforts for the same soil. The test that is carried out to determine the optimum moisture content is 
commonly referred to as the Proctor compaction test. The compactive effort applied for compac￾tion of soils during the Proctor test is dependent on the level of compactive effort expected in the 
feld—the higher the expected effort, the higher is the effort in the laboratory. 
Accordingly, there are two standards—AASHTO T 99 (Moisture-Density Relations of Soils 
Using a 2.5 kg [5.5 lb] Rammer and a 305 mm [12 in.] Drop; energy level of 12,400 ft lb per ft3 of 
soil) and AASHTO T 180 (Moisture-Density Relations of Soils Using a 4.54kg [10 lb] Rammer and 
a 457mm [18 in.] Drop; energy level of 56,200ft lb of energy per ft3 of soil). 
Once the optimum moisture content and the maximum dry density are determined from the 
laboratory, these values are used for specifying moisture levels (generally a little dry of the opti￾mum) and density (generally a percentage of the maximum). One practice is to use a fll in the site to 
determine the soil lift thickness and number of passes of compaction equipment that is required for 
the available equipment (or, if necessary, with other equipment) to achieve the required compaction 
level, and then prepare the method specifcations accordingly.

7.8 HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY 
Based on the results of experiments conducted by D’Arcy (1856), the fow of water through soils is 
characterized by the following expression: 
v k = i 7.18 
where 
v is the velocity of fow 
i is the hydraulic gradient (head loss per unit length of fow) 
k is the coeffcient 
Generally k is referred to as a coeffcient of permeability, permeability, or hydraulic conductivity. 
The permeability of different types of soils is shown in Table 7.6. 
Permeability for soils can be measured in the laboratory by using either a constant head (ASTM D 
2434; AASHTO T 215) or a falling head method (ASTM D 4630). In the constant head test, a constant 
head of water is maintained in a soil sample, and the fow rate (volume divided by time) is used along 
with the sample cross-sectional area to determine the permeability. In a falling head test, the level

of water in a standpipe is noted at regular time intervals as the water is made to fow through a soil 
sample, and the permeability is calculated on the basis of the total length and area of the soil sample, 
the area of the standpipe, and the initial and fnal levels of water in the standpipe at the specifed times. 
In the absence of test data, correlations with gradation properties can be used to estimate the 
permeability of different types of soils. For example, 
k C= kD102 7.19 
where 
k is the permeability, cm/s 
D10 is the effective grain size (cm) corresponding to size passing 10% 
Ck is the Hazen’s coeffcient, 0.8−1.2 (applicable for 0.1 mm < D10< 3 mm, Cu < 5) 
In general, coarse grained soils have higher permeability compared to fne grained soils. As such, 
coarse grained soils have good drainage capabilities and are preferred for pavement applications 
compared to fne grained soils. 
7.9 FROST SUSCEPTIBILITY 
In certain areas where freezing cold weather is common during the winter months, frost heaves are a 
common sight. In spring these heaves break apart under traffc and lead to potholes. The main causes 
of this distress are the environmental conditions and the existing soil in the lower pavement layers. 
Soils that have low permeability and retain water and that change in volume in freezing tempera￾tures are known as being frost susceptible. The degree of heaving in such soils cannot be explained 
only on the basis of the expandion of water into ice. 
Portions of a pavement can experience a rise or “heave” (frost heaves) due to the formation of 
ice lenses in these frost-susceptible materials, which typically contain excessive amounts of fne 
materials (i.e., those < 0.02 mm). Formation of ice lenses leads to pressure exerted by the ice and 
soil. There is differential movement in the pavement structure, and as a result there is roughness 
and cracking. Most of the water that forms the ice lenses is drawn up by capillary action from water 
tables. When the soil thaws in warm weather in spring (from the surface downward), this new water 
cannot drain quickly and leads to a signifcant increase in the moisture content of the subgrade and 
a signifcant reduction in shear strength. This is illustrated in Figure 7.13. The effects are relatively 
more signifcant in pavements with untreated layers.

FIGURE 7.13 Freeze-thaw in soils. 
The process starts with the soil and a water table close to the soil. A soil such as silt, which has a 
relatively high ability to draw water through small pores (high capillarity, 0.9–9 m rise compared to 
0.15m rise in coarse sand) as well as the ability to move water in the pores relatively rapidly (moder￾ate permeability, 0.9 m/day compared to 0.0009 m/day for clay) is considered to be frost susceptible. 
Such soil would draw water from a relatively close water table, and this water would freeze in the 
wintertime as the freezing front moves downward. The expansion of water as it freezes into ice 
lenses exerts pressure on the layers above them, which results in surface heaves. With the coming 
of spring, as the temperature rises the ice lenses start to thaw from top downward. This water in the 
subgrade and the void created (by the difference in the volume of ice and water) result in a weaker 
saturated subgrade and a weaker pavement structure as a whole. 
Subsequently, when traffc moves over the heaved surface, which has no or little support under￾neath, it breaks down into smaller pieces and forms potholes. Frost-susceptibility tests can be

conducted by subjecting soils to freeze-thaw cycles, noting the heave rate during the frst 8 h, and 
then determining the CBR, a strength-indicating test property, on the thawed soil after allowing 
time for the drainage of the water from the soil. The criteria shown in Table 7.7 can be used for the 
classifcation of the soil. 
Plots of frost susceptibility and heaves, shown in Figure 7.14, can be used for the frost suscepti￾bility classifcation of a soil. The use of dielectric constant devices, both in place and in the labora￾tory, has been developed to evaluate and monitor freezing and thawing processes in the soil.

Note: The higher the frost group number, the more susceptible the soil, i.e., soils in frost group 4 (FG-4) are more frost 
susceptible than soils in frost groups 1, 2, or 3. 
The frost susceptibility of the soil is affected primarily by the size and distribution of voids 
(where ice lenses can form) and is determined through empirical correlations from the soil classif￾cation (Unifed Soil Classifcation System) and the percentage fner than 0.02 mm. Table 7.8 relates 
these parameters to the frost codes. 
Frost heaves are nonuniform and tend to make pavements rougher, and expressions have been 
developed to relate the variability of soil frost susceptibility and the winter roughness. Affected 
pavement surface profles can be characterized in terms of dominant wavelength, which has been 
found to range from 10 to 80 m. 
Seasonal frosts can cause nonuniform heave and loss of soil strength during melting, resulting in 
a possible loss of density, development of pavement roughness, restriction of drainage, and crack￾ing and deterioration of the pavement surface. Whether such effects are possible or not depend on 
whether the subgrade soil is frost susceptible, if there is free moisture to form ice lenses, and if the 
freezing front is deep enough to penetrate the subgrade soil. 
During the design of pavements, the effect of the frost susceptibility needs to be checked by 
determining the depth of frost penetration—measures should be taken if the depth is found to 
penetrate into the frost-susceptible soil layer. The frost penetration depth can be estimated from 
Table 7.9. The required inputs are the air freezing index (degree days °F) and the unit weight of the 
soil (in pcf). The frost penetration depth is calculated from the interpolation of the data in Table 
7.9 developed on the assumption of a 12-in. (300-mm) thick rigid pavement or a 20-in. (510-mm) 
thick fexible pavement. Note that the air freezing index is a measure of the combined duration and 
magnitude of below freezing temperatures occurring during any given freezing season. The average 
daily temperature is used in the calculation of the freezing index. For example, if the average daily 
temperature is 12°F below freezing for 10 days, the freezing index would = 12°F × 10 days = 120°F 
days. It is recommended that the design air freezing index be based on the average of the three cold￾est winters in a 30-year period, if available, or the coldest winter observed in a 10-year period. Air 
freezing indices are available at www.ncei.noaa.gov/sites/default/fles/2021-09/Air-Freezing-Index￾Return-Periods-and-Associated-Probabilities.pdf.

The steps that could be taken to avoid or reduce the potential of the freeze-thaw problem are 
replacing the frost-susceptible soil, lowering the water table, increasing the depth of the pavement 
with nonfrost-susceptible soil over the frost-susceptible soil, and providing a means of draining 
away excess water, such as that from thawing. 
Frost protection can be provided by completely or partially removing the soil to the depth of frost 
penetration or by assuming a reduced modulus of the soil during design (so as to result in a thicker 
pavement structure, which in turn would provide a cover of nonfrost-susceptible materials on the 
frost-susceptible soil). 
7.10 SWELL POTENTIAL 
Soils consisting of minerals such as montmorillonite would expand signifcantly in contact with 
water. The presence of such soils in the subgrade would lead to differential movement, surface 
roughness, and cracking in pavements. Dominant wavelengths of affected pavements have been 
reported to range from 3.0 to 10.0 m. 
The swell potential of a soil is primarily dictated by its percentage of clay-size particles and the 
PI, as illustrated in the following by one of the many equations developed (Gisi and Bandy, 1980): 
b 3 4. 4 S %˜ ° ˛ aA C 7.20

Note: The potential for moisture fuctuation is a judgmental determination and should consider proximity of the water table, 
likelihood of variations in the water table, other sources of moisture, and the thickness of the swelling soil layer. 
a When control of swelling is attempted by compacting on the wet side of optimum and reduced density, the design subgrade 
strength should be based on the higher moisture content and reduced density. 
The swelling potential can be determined as the percentage change in volume due to absorption 
of water when tested for the CBR or in a Proctor mold. In the latter test, a soil is placed in a stan￾dard Proctor mold at its optimum moisture content with a surcharge of 1 psi, and the mold with a 
perforated base is placed in a pan full of water. The test is actually conducted on two specimens at 
optimum moisture content (OMC) +3% and OMC −3% moisture contents, and the results are used 
to determine the percentage swell at the OMC. 
The use of total suction characteristic curves has also been developed for the identifcation of 
swelling potential of soils. 
The presence of swelling soil can affect the performance of the pavement and deteriorate its 
serviceability. The loss in serviceability with time due to the effect of swelling soils can be mod￾eled as an exponential equation. Generally, soils exhibiting a swell percentage of greater than 3 (as 
determined with the CBR test, ASTM D 1883) are required to be treated. The Federal Aviation 
Administration in AC 150/5320–6F (2016) recommends modifed compaction efforts and careful 
control of compaction moisture, as well as removal of such soils and replacement by stabilized 
materials, as shown in Table 7.10. 
7.11 STIFFNESS AND STRENGTH OF SOILS 
The most important characteristic feature that needs to be determined for a soil is its response, 
such as strain and deformation to load (or, more specifcally, stress) from the traffc. In this respect, 
both “stiffness” and “strength” are important parameters that need to be measured in the labora￾tory. However, note that some design methods may use stiffness only and do not require the use of 
strength tests, while others may require it. 
For a strength test, a triaxial testing system is generally used to simulate the triaxial state of 
stress in the feld. Shear failure in soils is caused by slippage of soil particles past each other, and 
ISTUDYSoil 179
the resistance against such failure (shear strength) is provided by two components: friction and 
cohesion.
Frictional strength, commonly denoted as Normal Force × Coefficient of Friction, is expressed 
in soils in terms of the effective friction angle (or effective angle of internal friction), φ′, which is 
defined as follows:
p u ' = tan-1 7.22
where μ is the coefficient of friction.
Shear strength, S, due to friction is defined as S = σ′ tan φ′, where σ′ is the effective normal stress.
The frictional strength is dictated by many factors, including density, mineralogy, shape of 
the soil participles, gradation, void ratio, and the presence or absence of organic materials. 
The other component of soil shear resistance, cohesion (C), present in some soils (cohesive), is 
defined as the strength that exists in the soil even if the effective stress (σ′) appears to be zero. C 
is a result of different factors such as cementation, electrostatic attraction, adhesion, and nega￾tive pore water pressures. It is significantly affected by factors such as density, moisture, and 
drainage conditions.
Therefore, the combined shear resistance of the soil can be expressed as follows:
S C= ' + - p ' ' tan 7.23
Shear stress-strain curves for sand and gravel soils generally show ductile curves, whereas those for 
clays show brittle behaviors. A difference in test conditions would result in a difference in stress￾strain behaviors, and as such, tests for the determination of shear strength are conducted under 
standard conditions or expected field conditions.
For evaluation of the shear strength of soils, tests are conducted at different normal stress levels, 
and the failure shear stress corresponding to each normal stress level is determined. A series of such 
data points are connected to obtain the Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope and determine the cohesion 
and frictional components of the shear strength equation. This is explained in Figure 7.15.

(Note: The τ-intercept of this line is the effective cohesion, C′. The slope of this line is the effective frictional angle, φ′. The 
Mohr-Coulomb line is often referred to as the failure envelope—points in the soil that have (σ′, τ) values that fall 
below this line will not fail in shear, whereas the points with (σ′, τ) values that fall above this line will fail in shear).
 
ISTUDY 
180 Pavement Engineering 
Laboratory shear strength measurements can be conducted using the Direct Shear Test (ASTM 
D 3080), the Unconfned Compression Test (ASTM D 2166), or the Triaxial Test (ASTM D 2850 
and ASTM D 4767). 
In the direct shear test, a cylindrical soil sample is subjected to a vertical force and a shear force, 
and the shear stress and shear displacements data are obtained. The test is repeated with different 
samples for different values of the normal force, and the peak shear stress in each case is obtained. 
A plot of peak shear stress versus the normal stress provides the information for the components of 
the shear strength equation. Although simple, inexpensive, and suitable for sandy soils, the draw￾backs include nonuniform strain, failure along a specifc plane, and the inability to control drainage 
conditions (especially important for clay soils). 
The unconfned compression test uses an unconfned cylindrical soil sample on which normal 
stress is applied and the failure stress is noted. The shear strength is obtained from the unconfned 
compression strength. It is a simple, inexpensive, and quick test, but it lacks the ability to apply con￾fning stress that is usually present in the feld and hence underestimates the shear strength (since 
confnement increases the shear strength). 
The triaxial compression test is the most sophisticated of the three tests; in it, a soil sample is 
subjected to confning stress (by pressurized water) and loaded to failure. This test enables the 
determination of pore water pressure, if any, and the calculation of the effective stress (effective 
stress = total stress-pore water pressure). Depending on the soil and the specifc project, triaxial 
testing can be conducted under unconsolidated undrained, consolidated drained, or consolidated 
undrained conditions. 
7.11.1 CALIFORNIA BEARING RATIO TEST (AASHTO T 193) 
This procedure was originally developed by the California Division of Highways in the 1920s, later 
modifed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and fnally adopted by ASTM and AASHTO. 
The CBR test is actually a penetration test that uses a standard piston (3 in.2
) which penetrates 
the soil at a standard rate of 0.05 in./min. A unit load is recorded at several penetration depths, typi￾cally 0.1 and 0.2 in. The CBR value is computed by dividing the recorded unit load by a standard 
unit load that is required to penetrate a high-quality crushed stone material (1000 and 1500 psi for 
0.1 and 0.2 in., respectively). The CBR test is conducted on a soaked sample of soil—the sample 
is soaked in water (for 96 h) to simulate the worst (saturated) condition under which the pavement 
would perform. Figure 7.16 shows a mold with compacted soil (soaking) in a water bath.

7.11.2 resilient modulus test (aashto t 307)
The main disadvantage of all of the strength tests presented is that the loading is static as opposed to 
dynamic, which is the case due to traffic loading in the field, and that the soil sample is subjected to 
failure, which is not quite the case in the field, where stress levels at the subgrade level are in most 
cases too small to cause failure. These two deviations from actual field conditions make the strength 
tests relatively less useful for predicting deformation and strains under real-world traffic applications.
The more appropriate test to characterize subgrade soil is the stiffness test—one which applies 
dynamic loads on a soil in a way in which the traffic loads are applied in the field and at levels that 
are more representative of those coming from the traffic. The resilient modulus test is one such 
widely recognized and increasingly used test procedure. Resilient modulus is the elastic modulus 
used with the elastic theory. The elastic modulus based on the recoverable strain under repeated 
loads is called the resilient modulus, or Mr. It is defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the repeated 
axial stress to the amplitude of the resultant recoverable axial strain:

ISTUDY182 Pavement Engineering 
The basic principle of this test is to apply a series of stresses (with rest periods in between) 
under triaxial conditions and measure the resulting strain. A haversine or a triangular stress pulse is 
applied in order to simulate the traffc loading on pavements. 
As the magnitude of the applied load is very small, the resilient modulus test is a nondestructive 
test, and the same sample can be used for many tests under different loading and environmental 
conditions. This modulus is input in the mechanistic part of the mechanistic-empirical design pro￾cedure to estimate the response (such as strain) due to a traffc load. Generally, pulse loading and 
rest periods of 100 and 900 ms are used, respectively. 
The resilient modulus of the soil is determined at different stress levels (to simulate different 
levels of traffc load). These differences happen in terms of the deviator stress as well as the confn￾ing stress. Generally, designers try to model the modulus (y) with respect to one or more relevant 
stresses (such as deviator stress, as x, and/or confning stress, as x). Note that fne grained soils gen￾erally show stress-softening behavior, which means modulus decreases with an increase in deviator 
stress; coarse grained soils show stress-hardening behavior, which means an increase in modulus 
with an increase in the sum of the principal stresses. These important observations indicate the 
signifcant difference that can be expected in the response from the same soil materials at different 
depths (and hence difference stress levels) of a pavement. In the resilient modulus test, the stress 
levels are kept low enough to ensure an elastic response of the soil. However, researchers have used 
experiments to correlate elastic strain with permanent strain of soils. 
Confning stress is applied in this method using a membrane and water pressure, whereas axial 
stress is applied through an actuator mounted on a reaction-loading frame. In the standard resilient 
modulus test for soils, a soil specimen is subjected to multiple (such as 16) stress stages, each con￾sisting of the application of a specifc confning stress and a fxed count of pulsed axial deviator 
stress. The software, which controls the test, begins testing the soil specimen for the next stress state 
as one state ends, until all of the stress states are completed. The frst stress state is a conditioning 
state. Using sensors and software for the vertical and confning stress, the vertical and lateral speci￾men displacements are measured; for each stress state the mean and standard deviation of the dif￾ferent parameters for the last fve pulses are reported. An ASCII fle is created with the data, which 
can then be imported to a spreadsheet for further analysis. 
Any outlier, such as negative deviator stress values, very high or low values of resilient modu￾lus, and deviator stress values, should be discarded before statistical analysis of the data is con￾ducted. Next, the resilient modulus and the various stress data are evaluated to develop models 
relating the resilient modulus to one or more of the stress variables, according to the following 
equation:

An example of raw data and analysis is shown in Figure 7.19. 
The resilient modulus also needs to be conducted at different moisture and density levels to 
determine their effect, such that the response of a soil layer under varying environmental/construc￾tion conditions can be determined during design. One way of considering the effect of differing 
moisture and stress level conditions on the resilient modulus is to determine an effective roadbed 
soil resilient modulus, by considering the reduction of the resilient modulus of the soils in the dif￾ferent months. 
The AASHTO (1993) standard guide for design of pavement provides relationships between 
resilient modulus and layer coeffcients, whereas the relationship between CBR and resilient modu￾lus is provided by the U.K. Transportation Research Laboratories (Powell et al., 1984). The relation￾ships are as follows:

7.11.3 DYNAMIC CONE PENETROMETER (ASTM D 6951) 
The dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) is a device that is used for the determination of resistance 
against penetration (and thereafter obtain CBR or unconfned strength or modulus, through cor￾relation) of granular materials. It consists of a steel rod with a pointed tip (cone) that is driven into 
the granular material with a weight that slides along the rod. In an existing pavement, a hole is dug, 
and the DCP is lowered onto the granular layer for carrying out the test. The penetration of the rod 
per blow of the weight is recorded from a scale attached to the rod and is then utilized to obtain an 
indication of the strength/stiffness of the layer (Figure 7.20). A drop of the weight is used to seat the 
device on the layer. Usually three people are needed to conduct the test—one person for holding the 
device perpendicular, the second person to lift and release the weight, and the third person for record￾ing the reading. An 8kg weight is standard, but a lighter, 4.6kg weight can be used for soft ground

light falling weight devices that consist of one geophone in the center of the loading plate. A modu￾lus (ELWD or EPFWD) is calculated on the basis of the deformation of the soil (see Chapter 22 for 
details). Gudishala (2004) has provided the following equations relating Mr

7.12 SUBGRADE SOIL TESTS FOR RIGID PAVEMENTS 
When considering the magnitude of stresses induced in a slab under loading, the infuence of the 
subgrade is defned by its modulus of subgrade reaction (k). The modulus of subgrade reaction 
is defned as the ratio of the pressure applied to the subgrade using a loaded area divided by the 
displacement experienced by that loaded area. (Figure 7.21 shows a slab with springs defecting 
under load.) 
7.12.1 PLATE LOAD TEST 
The plate load test (Figure 7.22) applies a load to a steel plate bearing on the subgrade surface. The 
plate load is usually applied using a hydraulic jack mounted against a vehicle used for the reaction 
frame. The resulting surface defection is read from dial micrometers near the plate edge but away 
from the loading point. The value of k is found by dividing the pressure exerted on the plate by the 
resulting vertical defection, and it is expressed in units of N/mm3, MN/m3, kg/cm3, or lb/in.3 (pci). k 
is established by plate-bearing tests with a load plate diameter of 750 mm (30 in.). A modifcation is 
needed if a different plate diameter is used: for a 300 mm diameter plate, k is obtained by dividing

the result by 2–3, and for a 160-mm diameter plate, it is divided by 3.8. The modulus of subgrade 
reaction is determined by the following equation:

where
k is the modulus of subgrade reaction
P is the applied pressure (load divided by the area of the 762-mm [30-in.] diameter plate) (or, stress)

A plate load test was conducted on two types of soils, a subgrade and a 10-in. base over the 
subgrade. Results from the test are shown in Figure 7.23. Determine (k) for the subgrade and 
(k) for the subgrade-base combination.
Solution: The modulus of subgrade reaction is determined from the slope of the stress 
versus deformation curve:

As can be seen from Figure 7.23, the subgrade curve has two slopes: a steep initial slope of 
350 pci and a shallower slope of 133 pci. At this stage, the designer must decide on the level 
of deformation the subgrade will be subjected to. Otherwise, a more conservative value of 
133 should be selected. For the base + subgrade behavior, a relatively constant relationship is 
observed, and the slope is approximately 277 pci.

Layers of granular soil, typically 6–12in. thick, can be placed on the subgrade to improve their 
supporting ability, provide uniform support over variable soils, improve drainage, increase eleva￾tion in areas with high water tables, decrease potential of subgrade rutting, reduce potential of 
pumping and erosion in concrete pavements, and reduce frost susceptibility. Geosynthetics are used 
in various cases including the improvement of poor, highly sensitive and low strength soils, high 
water table areas and to provide reinforcements and barriers, fltration, and drainage. The steps in 
the application of geosynthetics consist of subgrade cleaning and preparation, unrolling of geosyn￾thetics in the direction of the traffc, stretching and staking as needed, placement and spreading of 
aggregates (without vehicles driving directly on it), and compaction using a vibratory roller. 
Any remaining soft area after compaction can be identifed by loading with fully loaded dump or 
water truck. Common specifcation for density of subgrade is 95% of maximum density as obtained 
from the Standard or the Modifed Proctor test (AASHTO T 99 and AASHTO T 180, respectively). 
7.13 SUBBASE AND UNSTABILIZED BASE 
Subbase and unstabilized base materials are generally characterized in the same ways. The char￾acterization tests are the same as those mentioned for subgrades except that organic content is not 
generally determined. 
Base layers can consist of unbound, granular, and stabilized materials, and their main function 
is as a supporting layer to increase structural capacity and/or drainage and prevent frost action in 
subgrade in asphalt pavements, as well as to prevent volume change and pumping of fnes from 
subgrade and expedite construction in concrete pavements. Requirements of aggregates for base 
courses include at least 2 fractured faces, LA abrasion of ≤ 45 (AASHTO T 96), soundness loss 
of ≤ 12 and 18 for sodium or magnesium sulfate test (AASHTO T 104), material passing the No. 
40 sieve is nonplastic (AASHTO T 90), and a permeability of ≥ 150 ft/day for a permeable base 
course. The requirements of aggregates in asphalt-treated base (ATB) include 2 fractured faces, 
ISTUDYSoil 189 
 
 
LA abrasion loss of ≤ 45 (AASHTO T 96), soundness loss of ≤ 12 and 18 for sodium or magnesium 
sulfate test (AASHTO T 104), well coating of aggregates with a minimum of 2.5% (AASHTO T 
287 or AASHTO T 308), and moisture damage (AASHTO T 283). Lime can be added at the rate of 
0.5%–1% for moisture susceptible aggregates. Specifcations for quality control of ATB consist of 
density, thickness, and grade. 
Stiffer and stronger base layers can also be constructed with aggregates and cement known 
as cement-treated base (CTB; can also be designed as a permeable layer) and lean concrete base 
(LCB). The specifed properties of CTB and LCB include 2 fractured faces (AASHTO T 335), 
wear ≤ 45 (AASHTO T 96), soundness ≤ 12 and 18 for sodium and magnesium sulfate (AASHTO 
T 104), air content of 4%–8% (AASHTO T 152) for LCB, coating of cement (typically 220–285 lb/ 
yd3
; AASHTO M 85), strength of 400–800 psi (CTB) and 750–1200 psi (LCB), water-cement ratio 
of 0.3–0.5, and workability (slump of 1–3 in.; AASHTO T 119). 
The potential concern about using recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) in base layers is the 
risk of washing calcium hydroxide from RCA, the formation of calcium carbonate in the pres￾ence of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and the deposition of the CaCO3 in pavement drainage 
systems; the alkalinity of the drainage through a RCA base might also result in some destruction 
of vegetation. 
7.14 SOIL STABILIZATION CONCEPTS AND METHODS: 
CHEMICAL AND MECHANICAL 
Soil stabilization refers to improvement of soil so that it performs a required function. Soil stabiliza￾tion techniques can be classifed into two groups: mechanical and admixture. Mechanical stabili￾zation can be through densifcation or compaction, addition of granular material and compaction, 
and the use of reinforcements such as geotextiles. Admixture stabilization (which also includes 
compaction as part of the process) can be done with the use of additives, such as lime, Portland 
cement, and asphalt. 
The stabilization process or mechanism results in the modifcation of the properties of the soil. 
Compaction results in an increase in strength or stiffness and a decrease in permeability and com￾pressibility. The use of additives (admixtures or modifers) results in changes in basic properties of 
the soil. For example, the addition of lime and cement and granular materials reduces plasticity. 
Cementing agents such as asphalt help develop bonds between soil particles, increases cohesive 
strength and decreases the absorption of water. Water-retaining agents such as calcium chloride 
(CaCl2) reduce evaporation rates and help reduce dust in construction sites as well as unpaved roads. 
7.14.1 MECHANICAL STABILIZATION BY DENSIFICATION OR COMPACTION 
Compaction is the artifcial process of increasing the density or unit weight and decreasing the void 
ratio of a soil mass. The energy consumed during compaction is called compactive effort. 
The mechanism of compaction consists of reorientation of soil particles, fracturing soil particles 
and breaking of bonds between them, and the bending or distortion of soil particles. For coarse 
grained soil, the primary mechanism is reorientation with some fracture, and the compactive effort 
must be high enough to overcome the friction between particles to make them reoriented. Water 
helps in the compaction by lubrication of the contacts. Effective compaction requires a reduction 
in frictional forces between the particles. Vibration is effective in moving particles relative to each 
other and reducing the normal force and friction. 
In fne grained soil, the primary mechanism of compaction is reorientation and distortion. The 
compactive effort must be high enough to overcome the cohesive/interparticle forces. Increased 
water content can decrease cohesion. Effective compaction requires high pressure and a shearing 
or kneading action to overcome cohesion. Sheepfoot rollers (with small contact area), tamping foot 
rollers, and rubber tire rollers are effective. 
ISTUDY190 Pavement Engineering 
7.14.1.1 Effect of Compaction on Soil Properties 
For cohesionless soil (granular soils), the effects of compaction are in terms of increases in strength 
and stiffness and decreases in compressibility and permeability. The properties are not affected by 
moisture content. The density that could be achieved with a specifc compactive effort infuences 
the properties. For cohesive soils, there can be difference in properties, even at the same dry density 
(due to differences in the soil structure, which can be focculated or dispersed). Generally the higher 
the density, the higher the strength. Note that soils compacted dry of OMC will have higher perme￾ability. The swelling potential is higher when density is high and the degree of saturation is low. The 
potential for shrinkage is higher for low density and a high degree of saturation. 
7.14.1.2 Field Compaction 
It is important to know the desired soil properties and select a laboratory method for controlling 
density to develop specifcations on percent compaction or percent maximum density. The water 
content should range around the OMC. 
The equipment and procedure for compaction should be selected to allow the level of compaction 
at the desired moisture content to be achieved economically. 
The factors that infuence feld compaction are as follows: 
1. Type of roller (vibratory rollers may cause fuffng, so the last few passes are made with 
vibration turned off) 
2. Size of rollers—weight and contact area/pressure 
3. Lift (layer) thickness—the thicker the lift the less effective the compaction 
4. Number of passes 
5. Strength and stiffness of the underlying material. Whether the compaction effort densifes 
the soil or actually shears it depends on this factor. One can start with a lower compactive 
effort initially and then gradually go to a higher compactive effort. 
7.14.1.3 Field Control 
Compaction in the feld needs to be controlled to ensure adequate density. This is done with the help 
of specifcations and measuring devices. Specifcations are generally written to control density and 
moisture content. There is a target density and a target water content range around the OMC. The 
average may be close to the target, but there may be some variability. Standard deviation values 
from historical data are used to set tolerances. Generally, a one-sided acceptance limit is set for 
density and the specifcation might read 100% pay if relative compaction ≥ 93%. 
7.14.1.4 Measuring Devices 
For density, one can use sand cone or balloon density measurement. This involves direct measure￾ment of mass and volume to calculate density. The disadvantage is that it is time consuming. A 
better method, which can be used for both density and moisture content, is using a nuclear gage for 
which the key is calibration. These measurements are done instantaneously. 
The nuclear gage can be used either in direct or backscatter mode. In the direct method, a hole 
is drilled, and the probe is inserted in it. The signal coming out of the probe tip (hydrogen atom) 
is picked up and used to measure the average condition in between the depth of the probe and the 
surface. In backscatter mode, the device is kept on the surface and a defnite depth of measurement 
is associated with this method. 
7.14.1.5 Intelligent Soil Compaction System 
In recent years, a number of roller companies have developed intelligent compaction (IC) systems, 
which continuously measure the stiffness/modulus of the compacted soil in real time, provide 
automatic feedback to control of vibration amplitude and frequency, and have an integrated global

Figure 7.24 shows the schematic of an IC roller—the essential features consist of GPS, a continu￾ous measurement system, and an onboard report system. Accelerometers mounted on the center of 
roller drums are generally used for IC measurements. 
A NCHRP study (NCHRP 21-09, fnal report available at http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/ 
nchrp/nchrp_rpt_676.pdf) provides details of testing with smooth drums and pad foot rollers (con￾sisting of intelligent soil compaction and roller-integrated continuous compaction control sys￾tems) of different manufacturers—Ammann (www.ammann-group.com/en/home/), Ammann/Case, 
Bomag (www.bomag.com/usa/index.aspx?&Lang = 478), Caterpillar (www.cat.com), Dynapac 
(www.dynapac.com/), and Sakai (www.sakaiamerica.com/)—and present recommended specifca￾tions, fundamentals of the roller measurement systems, relationships between roller-measured stiff￾ness and in situ stress-strain-modulus behavior, evaluations of automatic feedback control-based 
intelligent compaction, correlations of roller measurement values to spot-test measurements, and 
case studies of implementation of recommended specifcations. Some of the key points that have 
come from this study are that the vibration-based roller measurement values, MVs (different MVs 
are shown in Table 7.11), are correlated to each other but are signifcantly affected by operational 
parameters, such as amplitude, and the effect is dependent on the soil and layer conditions. The MVs 
are representative of a much deeper area than that of common compaction lifts and are a composite 
indication of the stiffness of a structure, such as subgrade, base, and subbase, and the relative contri￾bution of each layer is dependent on layer thickness, relative stiffness of the layers, vibration ampli￾tude, and drum/soil interaction issues (contact area, dynamics). With the current frst-generation 
technology, recommendations are made for different types of specifcations, which may or may not 
involve the use of MVs for quality assurance through initial calibration. 
7.14.2 USE OF GEOSYNTHETICS 
Geosynthetics (planar products manufactured from polymeric materials) are also used for stabili￾zation of subgrades. Of the different types of geosynthetic, geotextiles and geogrids are primarily 
used, either for separation of the subgrade from the aggregate base (to avoid contamination of the

base with the subgrade materials) and/or for strengthening the subgrade (particularly for very poor 
and/or organic soils and unpaved roads). For strengthening the subgrade, a suffcient stiffness and 
good interlock with the surrounding materials is necessary. Sometimes nonwoven/grids are more 
effective than woven geotextiles. Hence, the selection of the geosynthetic should be done after 
careful consideration of the existing soil conditions and objective of stabilization. The construction 
process consists of rolling out the geotextile on the cleaned and leveled subgrade and pulling out to 
avoid wrinkles. Adjacent rolls are overlapped (by around 30 in.) and the fabrics are kept in place by 
pins or staples or base materials. A woven or nonwoven geotextile could be used for strengthening 
the subgrade, or a geogrid could be used in conjunction with a separator geotextile. The relevant test 
properties include tensile strength (ASTM D 4632 and D 4595), tear strength (ASTM D 4533), punc￾ture strength (ASTM D 4833), permittivity (ASTM D 4491), apparent opening size (ASTM D 4751), 
and resistance to ultraviolet light (ASTM D 4355). Geocell is a type of a “three-dimensional” struc￾ture formed by welding strips of high-density polyethylene into a honeycombed structure. Different 
types of thicknesses of the material, as well as height and aspect ratios, are used for geocells, and 
they can be backflled with aggregates. Geocells are utilized as effective means of improving soil 
confnement and hence for the improvement of the bearing capacity (for example, in poor quality 
subgrade). Good information is available from the International Geosynthetic Society (http://geo￾syntheticssociety.org/) as well as from the Geosynthetic Institute (www.geosynthetic-institute.org/). 
As an example, the reader can refer to www.tensarplus.com for software design and a description 
of Tensar Interax®, a multi-aperture material multilayer polymeric geogrid that could be used for 
subgrade stabilization. 
7.14.3 LIME TREATMENT OF SOILS 
Lime is often used for soil stabilization. Detailed information can be obtained from the National 
Lime Association, www.lime.org. Limestone, CaCO3 or Dolomite, and CaCO3 + MgCO3 is heated 
in a rotary kiln to produce quicklime, CaO + CO2 or CaO + MgO + CO2. Water is added to it to 
make it react, + H2O → producing hydrated lime, Ca(OH)2 + Mg(OH)2. In a unit amount of quick￾lime, there are more Ca++ ions than in hydrated lime, and therefore it is more effective. There is not 
much difference between dolomite or limestone, as far as stabilization is concerned. 
The mechanisms of the soil-lime reaction consist of the following: 
1. The modifcation process happens through cation exchange. Ca++ is substituted for absorbed 
cations in the clay soil-water system. This process is most effective when the absorbed cat￾ions are sodium, Na+. They are replaced by Ca++. Li+ are most easily replaced although they 
ISTUDYSoil 193 
 
 
 
are not that common. It is replaced by Na+, which is the most common, which is replaced 
by K+, which can be replaced by Mg++ and Ca++. Two valence materials have stronger 
replacing power. 
Replacement power: 
Li+ < K+ << mg++ <<Ca++ (Holtz and Kovacs, 1981) 
2. Flocculation and agglomeration process that allows the end-to-side contact, and soil par￾ticles behave as larger particles. 
3. Cementing of soil particles due to carbonation of lime. In the presence of CO2, CaCO3 
is produced from CaO. Also, there is a pozzolanic reaction, in which lime reacts with 
alumina and silica from the clay minerals to form cementitious compounds similar to the 
process during the hydration of Portland cement. This reaction occurs only when there is 
excess lime after the completion of the cation exchange process. 
The modifcation process (cation exchange) is a faster reaction compared to the other mechanisms. 
The lime content required generally ranges from 3% to 5% (of hydrated lime by weight of the soil). 
As a result of this mechanism, the PI is decreased; as the liquid limit decreases and the plastic limit 
increases. The effective particle size increases, and as the moisture content remains the same, it appears 
that the soil is drier and more workable. Volume change and swell potential also decreases. 
The cementing mechanism can occur only after Ca++ requirements for modifcation have been 
satisfed. The requirement generally ranges from 5% to 10% hydrated lime. Adding more than 10% 
lime is generally not economically viable. This mechanism results in an increase of strength as can 
be measured with unconfned compressive strength. It is also common to add pozzolona (fy ash) to 
the soil to provide silica for the cementing action. This process is called lime-fy ash stabilization. 
Lime treatment is used in subgrade soils, subbase, and base materials. For subgrade soils (clay), 
lime can be used to reduce the potential of a change in volume, whereas for marginal base and sub￾base materials it is used to improve their quality. The main beneft of lime is the reduction in plastic￾ity and hence the reduction in the effect of water. This leads to improvement in both constructability 
and performance of the pavement. Soils already containing Ca++ are not affected by lime treatment, 
and the secondary effect of strength gain is, in some cases (such as sand-gravel mix), less than what 
could be achieved with the addition of Portland cement. 
The amount of lime needed depends on whether it is to be used as a modifer alone or also for 
increasing strength. The modifcation process results in a reduction of soil plasticity, which is a 
measurement of the effect of water on the soil, and the applicable tests are the Atterberg limit 
tests, LL, PL, and PI. Occasionally, swell tests are run to note either pressure or volume change. 
The cation exchange occurs rapidly, and these tests can be performed quickly. The lime content is 
expressed as a percentage of hydrated lime by dry weight of the soil. For the same lime, generally 
33% more hydrate lime (by weight) is required compared to quick lime. There may or may not be 
considerations of the strength and stiffness increase in design, and how permanent the of a strength 
increase is unknown. 
The cementing action results in an increase in strength, and this can be evaluated by running 
unconfned compressive strength or indirect tensile strength tests. The addition of lime may result in 
increases in strength in a layer, such as in subbase, which could lead to a reduction of the designed 
layer. Generally, for subgrade materials, the lime is added purely as a modifer. 
The construction process of lime stabilization involves the following steps: 
1. Scarifcation and pulverization done after cutting down the material to the required slope 
and grade. The scarifcation process loosens up the soil and makes mixing easy. 
2. Spreading lime, dry or as a slurry, depending on whether the area is windy, as well as cost. 
Considerations include cost, environmental concerns, production rate, and natural water 
content of the soil. 
ISTUDY 
194 Pavement Engineering 
3. Preliminary mixing and watering, which can be eliminated for easily workable subgrades 
and subbase materials. Heavy clays requires two mixings, and rotary mixers are the most 
effcient. Water is required for compaction to get lime distributed uniformly through the 
soil and is needed for the pozzolanic reaction. 
4. Preliminary curing to give time to react throughout the soil. (The earlier two steps are 
mostly for high-plasticity subgrade to make them friable and workable.) 
5. Second lime application. 
6. Final watering and mixing. 
7. Compaction. 
8. Finishing; subgrade trimmers are used for proper grading. 
Curing, which may involve spraying asphalt binder, is required to prevent moisture loss, 
erosion and damage from traffc, and construction traffc. Construction can also be done with 
a central pugmill mixing for subbase and base course stabilization. In this process, the mixing 
of soil, water lime, and fy ash, if needed, are added in proportion and mixed in the pugmill. 
Spreading is done by trucks, and the rest of the processes are similar to in-place application of 
lime. 
Climatic consideration in the stabilization process is important. If the temperature is too low, 
hydration or modifcation reactions with lime will not occur. The rule of thumb is that lime stabili￾zation should not be started unless the temperature is 40°F–45°F and rising. 
Safety considerations are also important. Quicklime is dangerous for the skin and dusting in 
urban areas could be a problem. 
Lime slurry pressure injection (LSPI) is also used for stabilization. In this process, a lime slurry 
is injected into the soil under pressure, ranging from 20 to 200 psi, at a spacing of 5ft, for example, 
and to a depth of 7–12ft depending on the application, but it is generally deep enough to go below 
the depth of seasonal moisture fuctuations. 
The volume of slurry is generally 10 gal/ft of depth and 2.5–3 lb of lime per gallon of water. 
Because of the low permeability of clays (soils for which lime treatment is necessary), fractures, 
seams, and fssures in the soil are necessary for effective application of this process. This process is 
most effcient in the dry season when cracks and fssures are the widest. 
This process can be used as a pretreatment or a posttreatment for the stabilization of building 
foundations and subgrades for railroads, streets, and airport pavements (e.g., to prevent swelling) 
and also in levees and slopes to reduce shrinkage potential. 
Lime is used for the stabilization of soils with PI > 12 and without sulfates, and also for highly 
plastic soils before using cement for further stabilization. 
Examples of modern lime spreading and stabilization equipment are shown in Figure 7.25. 
7.14.4 CEMENT TREATMENT OF SOIL 
For low plasticity soils and granular soils, cement stabilization is used. Recommendations are to 
use in soils with PI < 20 and with ≥ 45% passing the no. 40 sieve. The cement content is 3%–10% 
of dry weight of soil. Specifcations include a ≥ 150 psi unconfned compressive strength after 
7 days of curing. In cement treatment, suffcient Portland cement is added to the soil to produce a 
hardened mixture resulting from a hydration reaction. Detailed information can be obtained from 
the Portland Cement Association, www.cement.org, as well as the American Concrete Pavement 
Association, www.pavement.com.) Portland cement, which is produced from a mixture of lime￾stone, clay, shales, and iron ore, contain Ca, Si, and Al, which reacts with water, to produce hydrated 
calcium silicate or aluminate. Unlike lime, cement soil reaction does not require an external source 
of Al, and Si, and is more effective in this reaction than lime.

ISTUDY196 Pavement Engineering 
Cement-stabilized soils can be categorized into a few groups: 
1. Soil cement, which consists of a mix of natural soil of low or marginal quality (such as 
natural clay or clayey sand) and cement. The objective of this stabilization is to make such 
soils usable as subgrade soils. The feasibility of using cement becomes an issue in such 
cases where the demand for the cement can exceed 20%. 
2. Cement-treated base (CTB) is a mix of granular materials of a reasonably high quality 
(often they meet base course specifcations) and cement, used as high-quality stiff base 
course in pavements with high loads and traffc volume. The mix can contain wither 
crushed or uncrushed base course aggregate or with a blend of both materials. The 
cement content is generally kept lower than 4% to prevent excessive refective cracking 
in pavements. 
3. Econocrete, which is a mix of low-quality aggregates (natural or reclaimed aggregates that 
do not meet the standard specifcations) and cement, used principally as a subbase (such as 
in airport pavements). 
The use of CTB under a relatively thin (say 3 in.) hot mix asphalt (HMA) surface layer would 
result in refection cracks. While breaking the bond between the CTB and the HMA with a crushed 
stone layer is one option, it results in a structure with a weaker layer above a stiffer layer. Since the 
option of using a very thick HMA is not economical, it is often advised not to use cement-stabilized 
materials in fexible pavements (with HMA surface layer). Alternatively, it is recommended to fol￾low the guidelines regarding the minimum thickness of HMA with CTB or use a stone (crushed 
aggregate) interlayer. Since the spacing of the cracks is a function of the strength of the CTB, a 
lower percentage of cement would result in a larger spacing of the cracks. Therefore, the maximum 
allowable cement content could be determined from the minimum thickness of the HMA layer that 
is needed for controlling the cracks. 
The modifcation with cement results in three things—a reduction in plasticity, a decrease in 
volume change capacity, and an increase in strength and stiffness. Because cementation may not 
be permanent, the reduction in plasticity is perhaps the most important process. The increase in 
strength due to cementation may be lost due to weathering, such as through repeated freeze-thaw 
cycles. The hydration reaction of Portland cement and water that results in cementitious compounds 
that cement soil particles together is a time-dependent process. In the initial cementation process, 
there is rapid strength increase; then there is a slow long-term strength gain. There is release of Ca++ 
ions as a result of Pozzolanic reaction, and the slow process is the carbonation reaction where Ca 
reverts back to CaCO3 compound. 
7.14.4.1 Mixture Design Process 
The mix design process for cement-modifed soils (meant for the reduction of plasticity and perma￾nent or temporary strength gain) is simple, whereas for cement-stabilized soils (meant for increasing 
the strength of the soil; change in strength is permanent; durability is important), it is more complex. 
7.14.4.1.1 Mix Design for Cement-Modifed Soils 
Atterberg limit tests are run on raw and then on modifed soils usually at 1, 24, and 48h after mix￾ing to establish plasticity modifcation. Note that most of the modifcation happens within an hour. 
Moisture density tests are conducted to establish compaction requirements. Strength increase is 
not considered but a compressive early strength test is run to check the requirements of minimum 
strength. 
7.14.4.1.2 Mix Design for Cement-Stabilized Soils 
The purposes of the mix design are to determine the amount of Portland cement to adequately harden 
soil (adequacy is determined by the development and maintenance of strength during weathering), 
ISTUDYSoil 197 
determine the amount of water needed for compaction (OMC is usually suffcient for hydration), and 
determine how density affects strength, stiffness, and durability of the mix. 
Step 1: Selection of preliminary cement content from design guidelines—the poorer the soil, 
the higher the amount of cement is required; the amount needed goes up signifcantly if 
there is organic material. 
Step 2: Conducting moisture-density tests—different for that of raw soil—this is given in 
ASTM D 558 and AASHTO T 134; this step helps in establishing OMC and maximum dry 
density for compaction durability, strength, and construction compaction control. 
Step 3: Conducting durability tests—wet dry tests—ASTM D 559 and AASHTO T 135; 
freeze-thaw tests—ASTM D 560 and AASHTO T 136. The purpose is to select cement 
content so that soil cement or CTB will stay hard and maintain strength when subjected 
to alternate wetting/drying or freezing/thawing cycles. Strength may be considered as a 
secondary requirement, but it has been determined that cement content established by 
durability ensures adequate long-term strength. Test procedure calls for three cement 
contents, one freeze-thaw, and one wet dry specimen at each cement content. Specimens 
are 4 in. in diameter and 1/30 ft3 in volume. The specimens are compacted to OMC and 
maximum dry density (from Step 2) and moisture density tests are performed on mate￾rial with median cement content. The specimens are moist cured for 7 days and then sub￾jected to wet dry or freeze-thaw tests as follows. For wet dry tests, samples are soaked 
for 5 h at room temperature (77°F) and then oven dried for 42 h at 160°F. A wire brush is 
used to apply two strokes per area. This is repeated for 12 cycles. After the 12th cycle, 
it is dried at 230°F and weighed. The weight loss is calculated as % of the original dry 
weight of the sample. Note that to fnd the dry weight, one will need the moisture content 
of the sample. 
The moisture density curve to get max dry density is plotted for the median cement content. The 
same compactive effort is needed when preparing wet dry, or freeze-thaw samples. 
For freeze-thaw tests, the following steps are used. Freeze at -10°F for 24h; thaw in a moist 
room at 70°F and 100% relative humidity for 23 h. Brush after each thaw cycle; repeat for 12 cycles; 
compute weight loss. 
Selection of the fnal cement content is based on the weight loss as follows (PCA method). Weight 
loss for different soil types (AASHTO group): 
A ˜1 A, ˜ 2 , ˜ 4 A ˜ 2 ˜ 5,A ˜ 3 ° 14%
A ˜ ˜2 6,A ˜ ˜2 , 7 A ˜ 4 A, ˜ 5 ° 10%
A ˜ 6,A ˜ 7 ° 7%
For the compressive strength requirement, supplementary tests to durability tests are conducted at 
cement contents selected on the basis of durability tests. 
For this test four 2in. diameter specimens are used. The samples are moist cured for 2, 7, and 
28 days and tested at various times. Strength criterion is based on minimum strength; additional 
requirement could be that strength increases with age. 
The construction process for soil cement is very similar to the process with lime. 
The objectives include pulverizing the soil, mixing it with the proper amount of cement, com￾pacting it to the maximum optimum water content to get the maximum dry density or a percentage 
thereof, and maintaining the moisture to allow hydration of cement. The steps are as follows: 
1. Shape to proper line and grade (this should be done prior to adding cement since once it 
starts to hydrate it is diffcult to line and grade). 
ISTUDY198 Pavement Engineering 
2. Scarify, pulverize, and prewet—this is important in dry windy condition since if the inter￾face is dry and windy a signifcant amount of cement is lost. 
3. Spread Portland cement—this is done with tanker with a spreader bar attached; small jobs 
may use bags of cement; each bag weighs 94lb (approximately 1 ft3
). 
4. Add water and mix—twin shaft rollers may be used just as in lime use. 
5. Compact—initially this is usually done with sheepsfoot or vibratory roller and to fnish it 
is done with a rubber tired or steel wheel roller. 
6. Final shaping and fnishing—to reestablish the line and grade—this must be accomplished 
quickly before hydration. Typical fnishing operations include shaping with a motor grader 
before rolling with a steel wheel roller and then with a rubber tired roller to seal the sur￾face. Curing is generally done for 7 days, either with moist cloth or burlap or by spraying 
with an emulsion (say 0.15–0.3 gal/yd2
). It is then sanded to protect the surface if traffc is 
expected. 
The mixing process can also be conducted in a plant. In this process, the subgrade is compacted 
and shaped to line and graded, and the cement and water are mixed in a central plant. A screw 
conveyor or compressed air is used to get cement from the silo to the pugmill in the plant. The mix 
is then transported to the job site in dump trucks. It must be spread by mechanical spreaders for 
uniform thickness. It is advisable to break up the construction area into smaller elements and do 
mixing and compaction. Such proper sequencing of construction operation is required to prevent 
damage to unfnished sections in the case of rain. 
Temperature is an important consideration—soil cement work is not started if it is not 40°F and 
rising (April to October is suitable for most parts of the United States). There should not be freezing 
for 7 days; otherwise preliminary strength gains will be destroyed. The surface must be protected 
from heavy traffc and erosion from rain. Application of emulsion provides abrasion resistance to 
protect from construction equipment. Rain is actually good as it prevents moisture loss; however, a 
prime coat is needed to resist erosion. 
For quality control, checks are required for compaction (dry density), water content, and cement 
content. Cement content can be checked by putting a 1 yd2 burlap on the pavement and weighing it 
after the cement has been spread. Figure 7.25 shows a cement slurry mixer that is used for cement 
stabilization. 
7.14.5 ASPHALT (BITUMINOUS) TREATED SOIL 
The main functions of asphalt stabilization are to decrease permeability in fne grained soils and 
improve cohesion in coarse grained soils. The three types of asphalt-stabilized soils include asphalt￾aggregate mix, used as base course; sand-asphalt mix; and a combination of subgrade soil of high 
plasticity, lime, and asphalt. 
Asphalt viscosity has to be reduced to be mixed with soil. In the hot process, heated asphalt 
cement is mixed with heated aggregate mixture to produce high-quality HMA. In the cold pro￾cess, a mix of asphalt emulsion and soil is produced to produce a low-quality material. Clean sand 
and natural gravels are used. (Note that foamed asphalt is also increasingly being used for asphalt 
stabilization—for details, see Section 20.5.2.3.2.) 
7.14.5.1 Stabilization Mechanism with Asphalt Treatment 
It improves the properties of the soil by the following mechanisms. 
1. Waterproofng: The soil particles are coated with asphalt, and water does not come in 
contact with the soil particles which makes the soil less sensitive to water and lowers the 
absorption of water. 
2. Cementation: The asphalt increases the cohesion of the mix. 
ISTUDYSoil 199 
Asphalt emulsion is used with fne grained soils primarily to make them waterproof. It may be 
used in conjunction with lime treatment. For fne grained soils with a maximum LL of 40, PI of 18; 
4%–8% asphalt is used. 
Clean sand is also used to produce sand asphalt for pavement layers as well as impervious liners 
or slope protection. Generally 4%–10% asphalt is used when the primary requirement is cementa￾tion. General rules include limiting the PI at 12% and a limit on the maximum passing of the #200 
sieve, such as 12% or 25%. 
Gravel and sand gravel mixtures are used to improve substandard materials having unaccept￾ably high fne content (#200 material). The primary function of such mixes is waterproofng and 
a reduced potential of strength change and volume change when exposed to water. General rules 
include a limit of 12% for the PI, and the maximum percent passing the #200 sieve is 15%. Generally 
2%–6% asphalt is used. 
7.14.5.2 Mix Design Procedure 
While the Marshall mix design procedure can be used for HMA (discussed in Chapter 12), the 
asphalt soil mixes could be designed using the Hubbard-Field mix design procedure (ASTM D 915 
and ASTM D 1138—note that both standards have been withdrawn from ASTM). The basic proce￾dure for the Hubbard-Field mix design consists of compaction using different asphalt contents and 
checking the strength with extrusion test. The extrusion requirements are as follows: 
Fine grained soils 
Room temperature—extrusion value before soaking 1000 min 
Extrusion value after soaking 7 days—400 min 
Expansion, 5% max, absorbed water—7% maximum 
Sand and gravel 
Sands: Extrusion value minimum, 1200 (tested while submerged at 140°F—there is an air 
curing period prior to testing). 
The properties considered in Marshall mix designs are stability, fow, air voids, and voids in mineral 
aggregate. 
Construction considerations for asphalt-treated soils are whether asphalt-treated soils should be 
mixed in-place or at a central mix operation, depending on the location of the material to be stabilized. 
The steps in the in-place mixing operation consist of establishing line and grade, pulverizing the 
material, adding emulsion, mixing, and compaction. The application of emulsion and the mixing 
can be done with a distributor truck with a spray bar and a mixer, or both steps can be accomplished 
with one single pass of specialized equipment. Adequate moisture in the soil is necessary for proper 
mixing, and the timing of compaction is critical to avoid rutting and shoving. 
A travel plant or a traveling pugmill can also be used for mixing and is used mostly for cold 
mix. Plant mix (central mix) operation is seldom used for fne grained soils. Emulsion and unheated 
aggregates are metered and blended in a pugmill. Generally a continuous plant is used where aggre￾gates and emulsion are fed and mixed continuously. Hauling, spreading, and compaction follow, and 
the timing of the aforementioned operations is critical. The timing should be made relative to the 
time of the break of the emulsion. The key is the consideration of the type of emulsion used—rapid, 
medium, or slow setting, which determines how fast the breaking occurs. 
Rapid setting emulsion is used in surface treatments or chip seals; it involves spraying a layer of 
asphalt by a distributor truck and putting aggregates with another truck behind it. In many cases, this 
happens in a traffcked road, so rapid setting emulsion is desirable. Medium setting emulsion is used 
for short haul jobs, and slow setting emulsions are used for long haul jobs. By varying the type and 
amount of the emulsifying agent, one controls the setting time (RS, MS, or SS) of the emulsion. For 
construction control, checking the density and asphalt content (e.g., with nuclear gage) are required. 
Examples of modern equipment used for soil stabilization are shown in Figure 7.25.

7.15 DUST CONTROL 
Dust control on unpaved roads is necessary because of the following: 
1. Dust decreases safety in roads by reducing visibility. 
2. Dust in roads causes environmental hazards. 
3. Loss of road materials causes increases in cost of maintenance of roads, as well as mainte￾nance of vehicles. 
For the results of several dust control studies in the United States (The Forest Service, U.S. 
Department of Agriculture [USDA], see www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/16/ 
nrcs143_008708.pdf) as well as other countries such as South Africa (Jones, 1999) and Australia 
(Foley et al., 1996) are available for guidance. The amount of dust that is generated depends on a 
number of factors such as silt content of the soil, speed, weight, the number of vehicles, and rain￾fall. Dust palliatives can be grouped into different types, such as water, water-absorbing chemicals 
(salts), organic petroleum products (e.g., asphalt and resins), organic nonpetroleum product (such 
as lignosulfonate), electrochemical products (e.g., enzymes), synthetic polymer products (such as 
polyvinyl acetate), and clay (e.g., bentonite). 
Water is readily available and is easy to apply, but it evaporates quickly and does not last long. 
Asphalt emulsions are also relatively easy to apply, but they are relatively expensive and could run 
off to side ditches. Hygroscopic materials, such as salts (NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2), draw water from 
the air and keep the ground moist and hence reduce the potential of the formation of dust. NaCl is 
not very effective since it requires relative humidity > 75% to work. CaCl2 and MgCl2 are effective 
in relative humidity as low as 30%–40%. They are capable of drawing moisture from atmosphere in 
low relative humidity and keep the soil moister than it would actually be without the salts. Generally 
CaCl2 or MgCl2 are put down in solution by distributor trucks and mixed in with the soil with a 
motor grader. The advantages of CaCl2 and MgCl2 are that they are relatively inexpensive and easy 
to apply. The disadvantages are that they are corrosive and cause equipment and vehicles to rust, and 
salts in ground water and surface water are not desirable, particularly in agricultural areas. Also, 
salts may dissolve in rain and get washed away, which does not provide a permanent solution to the 
dust problem. Sometimes the salts could make a road surface more slippery. 
Lignosulfonates are processed pulp liquor from paper mills, typically consisting of 50% solids. 
When sprayed down it acts as a binder and holds the particles together. Advantages are that it is 
relatively inexpensive, effective, noncorrosive, environmentally safe, and gives some hardening of 
the surface to make it more traffcable. The disadvantages are that it may leach away, and the treated 
material may not be easily degradable. Emulsifed petroleum resins are also used as a dust pallia￾tive. Containing about 60% resin, this product is generally diluted with water and applied at the rate 
of 1/2 to 3/4 gal/yd2. These commercial products are relatively expensive but provide the advantages 
of the ability to control the depth of penetration by varying the amount of concentrate and the abil￾ity to store products for long term (such as through winter). The buildup of resin residue in the soil 
allows decreasing the percentage of concentrate over succeeding applications. For example, see 
www.goldenbearoil.com/PDF%20Files/Coherex.pdf. 
New generations of dust control additives are being developed on the basis of sophisticated 
technology. One such example is TerraLOC®, based on nanotechnology, that has been devel￾oped by MonoSol. The material is environmentally safe, biodegradable, cures quickly, and can 
be applied without modifcation of conventional spraying equipment. The application of water 
can extend the life of the TerraLOC® that is already in the soil in between applications. This 
product has been successfully used in military applications such as landing areas for helicopters 
and in civil airports; it can be used for unpaved roads and industrial areas for dust control (for 
details, see www.jaylineaust.com/turf-protection-products/temporary-transportation-roadways/ 
temporary-transportation-j-l-a-terraloc-dust-abatement/).

8 Aggregates for Asphalt 
and Concrete Mixes 
8.1 DEFINITION, PARENT ROCK, AND TYPES 
Aggregate can be defned as natural or processed sand, gravel, crushed stone, or any combinations 
thereof. Natural aggregates are procured from pits or riverbeds whereas manufactured aggregates 
are obtained from quarries. The process of obtaining aggregates consists of blasting or dredging. 
Large-size particles are crushed to obtain usable sizes that range from 50 mm to less than 0.075 mm 
for most pavement mixes. Since aggregates are derived from parent rocks, their characteristics 
depend on the properties of the parent rocks. The parent rocks can be classifed in terms of their 
geologic origins, which dictate their chemical composition and hence many of the other key proper￾ties that affect their behavior and performance. Artifcial aggregates are obtained as by-products of 
other industrial processes (such as slag from the production of steel). 
Elements combine to form minerals, and minerals form different types of rocks. There are fve 
groups of minerals that make up most rocks: silicates (containing primarily silicon and oxygen), 
carbonates (with carbon, oxygen, and other elements), oxides (oxygen and various metals), sulfates 
(sulfur, oxygen, and metals), and sulfdes (sulfur and metals). Examples of minerals are quartz, 
SiO2; mica, K(Mg, Fe)3 (AlSi3O10)(OH)2 and feldspar, KAlSi3O8. 
Geologically, parent rocks can be divided into three types: igneous, sedimentary, and metamor￾phic. Extrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma—a viscous liquid composed of silicates that 
is erupted onto the earth’s surface as ash, lava fows, or solid chunks. These rocks are classifed 
according to their texture and mineralogy and are generally fner grained than the intrusive igne￾ous rocks (which are not visible on the earth’s surface but remain below it). Extrusive rocks include 
andesite, basalt, and rhyolite. In the case of intrusive igneous rocks, magma is forced into other 
rocks as crosscutting or parallel (to layers of other rocks) and may consist of large areas consisting of 
thousands of square miles. Such large masses tend to contain a greater amount of silica (50%–60%) 
compared to smaller dark-colored intrusions, which are sometimes referred to as trap rock. Intrusive 
rocks include granite, diorite, gabbro, and peridotite. Generally, good-quality aggregates can be pro￾duced from different types of igneous rocks, which may contain a wide variety of minerals. 
Sedimentary rocks are those that are formed as a result of the consolidation of sedimentary 
materials formed by the reduction (clastic processes) of rock particle size through weathering and/ 
or abrasion or through the consolidation of chemical precipitates such as marine plant and animal 
deposits (carbonate rocks). In the clastic process, the weathering and abrasion action can be caused 
by wind, water, ice, or gravity, whereas the cementation of the materials is caused by deposition of 
silica or carbonate materials carried by groundwater and compressed by the weight of the overlying 
materials. Examples of sedimentary materials formed by the clastic process are shale (from clay), 
siltstone (from silt), sandstone (from sand), and conglomerate (from gravel). 
Examples of carbonate rocks are limestone and dolomites, formed by the consolidation and 
cementation of shells of marine plants and animals and also from fne carbonate mud from marine 
water. Both silica-rich materials, such as sand and silt, and clastic sedimentary rocks can be found 
within or interlayered with carbonate rocks. 
Sedimentary rocks may also form under specifc chemical conditions and contain materials such 
as iron and gypsum. 
Metamorphic rocks are formed by the alteration (recrystallization) of igneous or sedimentary 
rocks through high pressure and temperature. Parallel orientation and platy appearance for such 
ISTUDY204 Pavement Engineering 
rocks are common as a result of shearing action. Sometimes, metamorphic rocks are formed by 
the action of heat resulting from their vicinity to large intrusive magma or other sources of heat. 
An example is the formation of marble from carbonate rock. A metamorphic equivalent of igneous 
rocks such as granite is gneiss, whereas metamorphic equivalents of sedimentary rock such as shale 
are slate and schist. 
Natural sand and gravel are unconsolidated sedimentary materials, which are formed from the 
breakdown of rocks through the action of ice, wind, or water and generally consist of smooth and 
rounded particles. The nature of the parent rock dictates the quality of sand and gravel that result 
from its weathering. Hence, sands produced from igneous and metamorphic rocks or those pro￾duced from the ice or water-weathering action of stronger rocks at higher elevations tend to be stron￾ger than those produced from shales or siltstones or those derived from weaker rocks in low-lying 
areas. Climate, under which weathering takes place, also has an important effect on the quality 
of sands and gravels. For example, those resulting from prolonged and deep chemical weathering 
under humid conditions are of better quality than those formed by the weathering of rocks by a 
continental ice sheet. 
Weathering can be physical, chemical, or combined. Physical weathering takes place as a result 
of changes in temperature, humidity, and cycles of freezing and thawing or wetting and drying. 
Chemical weathering always results in the release of salts and colloids, which may be deposited and 
infuence the quality of some rocks. 
8.2 SUITABILITY FOR APPLICATION 
For evaluation of suitability of aggregates from different parent rocks for different applications, it is 
important to understand that within the similar type of rocks (such as igneous), there could be wide￾ranging variations, such as in composition and texture. For example, igneous rocks can be porous 
or dense, and the hardness and abrasion resistance depend on the size of the individual crystals that 
make up these rocks (they are greatest when crystals are less than 2mm in size). Compositional 
factors are important; for example, certain high-silica glassy materials are unsuitable for use in 
Portland cement applications because of their tendency to react with the alkali in the cement. 
Rocks of the same group with similar materials but different textures produce different-quality 
aggregates. For example, although all of them belong to the igneous group, quartz have tightly inter￾locked mineral grains (giving good-quality aggregates), whereas micas are without interlocking 
mineral grains and are present as weak layer deposits; olivines consist of structures with rounded 
grains. Variations during the crystallization process of low-viscosity and low-silica igneous mate￾rial can also result in the segregation of minerals (magmatic differentiations), which results in varia￾tion in rocks. Variations in metamorphic rocks are also common. For example, slates, with platy 
structure, are formed as a result of shearing action at low temperature, whereas schists formed at 
higher temperatures may have more sound structure. For sedimentary rocks, variations can be in 
the form of the amount of clay (shale has high clay content) as well as in cementation, often within 
formations; the extent of cementation in many cases is dictated by the age of the sedimentary rock 
formation. 
In most cases, pavement engineers have to use locally available aggregates. There are certain 
characteristics of different types of aggregates that must be considered during the mix and struc￾tural design of pavements. Petrographic examination (ASTM C 295) of aggregates can be conducted 
to identify different parent rock materials and minerals in an aggregate sample. Such examination 
can provide valuable information regarding the suitability of aggregates for asphalt and concrete 
mixtures, particularly with respect to their durability, such as resistance against breakdown under 
freeze-thaw or moisture actions. Petrographic examination may include tests ranging from detailed 
visual examination to investigation using a polarizing microscope, differential thermal analysis, 
and X-ray diffraction. Figure 8.1 shows an example of results of petrographic examination of an 
aggregate sample.

8.3 PRODUCTION 
Natural aggregates are either obtained from rock quarries or sand/gravel pits. The production of 
aggregates is a complex process consisting of many steps. The process starts with the identifca￾tion of a viable deposit by a geologist. Many factors are considered before setting up a quarry. 
These factors include the development of the facility, hauling, processing, regulatory expenses, and 
administrative costs, as well as the expected sales and profts. A thorough step-by-step exploration 
is generally performed to identify the location of the quarry. 
Standard topographical quadrangle maps and aerial photos are used to identify sand and gravel 
deposits, and such deposits with coarser aggregate sizes are preferred over those with fner sizes. 
Maps of geological bedrocks are studied for the identifcation of different strata before deciding on 
a quarry location for crushed aggregates (stones). Information from aerial photos and geophysical 
methods and information from existing quarries in the area may also be used. Once a potential site 
is located, it is important to study and understand outcrops as well as to investigate the uniformity 
of the different strata (outcropping and not outcropping), and geologic mapping may be conducted 
especially if it is of a complex nature. To determine the reserves in a potential quarry, sampling can 
be taken from outcrops or pits or by taking a core after drilling. 
One important step is the determination of the total amount of overburden, which is the material 
above the mineable aggregate resource that should be removed. Such determination can be made 
with the help of exploration with drilling and/or with geophysical methods such as seismic or radar 
technology. 
The amount of aggregate reserve (volume) in a proposed quarry can be calculated by simply 
multiplying the thickness of the layers by the area or, as in the case of layers of variable thickness, 
calculated from the sum of reserve for separate cross sections drawn at regular intervals through 
the quarry. The tonnage of crushed aggregate is calculated by multiplying the volume by weight of 
usable rock per unit volume. Typical specifc gravities of common raw rock are shown in Table 8.1. 
3 2000 Yield (ft /ton) = 8.1 62. *4 Specific gravity
Volume of reserve (ft3
) Reserve tonnage = 3 8.2 Yield (ft /ton)
The usable tonnage is the in-place reserve less the unrecoverable material from buffer zones, pit 
slopes, waste, haul roads, and ramps.

The production of aggregates from rocks in a quarry consists of two primary steps: removal of 
rock from the quarry by blasting and sizing and separating different sized particles with the help of 
a series of crushers and screens. The blasted particles, for example, 8in. in diameter, are fed into a 
jaw crusher, after screening the minus-1-in. material that results from the breaking of the weathered 
rocks around the edges of the sound rock. The crushed material from the jaw crusher is screened 
and then separated into different size stockpiles, whereas the larger fraction (e.g., plus-1-in. mate￾rial) is fed into secondary cone crushers for further crushing. Although the type of crushing equip￾ment used is dictated by the rock and the properties of the end product that is desired, all crushers 
primarily use four types of mechanisms for reducing the size of particles: impact, attrition, shear￾ing, and compression. 
Generally, once production is started from a quarry, the aggregates are tested for their different 
properties (called source properties), and depending on the results of the tests, the aggregates are 
approved for use in specifc applications, such as by the state department of transportation. 
Excellent information on all types of aggregates used in the construction industry can be obtained 
from the National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association at www.nssga.org. 
8.4 OVERVIEW OF DESIRABLE PROPERTIES 
Specifc properties that are critical for good performance in different applications have been iden￾tifed, and tests have been developed to measure them. Such tests have also been standardized by 
agencies, such as the ASTM. Although there are common desirable features, specifc applications 
require specifc properties of aggregates. For pavements, such applications include use as structural 
layers (in roads as well as railroads), drainage layers, asphalt mixtures, and cement concrete. 
8.4.1 PROPERTIES CRITICAL FOR STRUCTURAL LAYERS 
Aggregates could be used as base layers to decrease the stress coming from traffc (above) to the sub￾base and subgrade layers (below). For proper functioning, aggregates must be of suffcient strength, 
and if used as unsurfaced roads, they must possess good wearing resistance as well. Aggregates 
must be resistant to degradation action of traffc and maintenance equipment, cycles of wet dry and 
freeze-thaw, accumulation of fnes or binding of the aggregate layers, and the potential of swelling 
or frost heaves. 
8.4.2 PROPERTIES CRITICAL FOR DRAINAGE LAYERS 
When used as drainage layers, the proportion of different sized particles in the aggregate (grada￾tion) must be such as to allow suffcient drainage of water and work as a flter to prevent erosion and 
clogging due to fner materials. 
8.4.3 PROPERTIES CRITICAL FOR ASPHALT MIX LAYERS 
For use in asphalt mixes, the general requirements include cleanliness, proper shape, and resistance 
against the effects of traffc and environment-related abrasion and weathering. 
8.4.4 PROPERTIES CRITICAL FOR CEMENT CONCRETE LAYERS 
In the blends used for cement concrete mixes, limitations are generally applied on the amount of 
fne aggregates to prevent the presence of clay particles. The aggregate must be resistant to the 
effects of abrasion and weathering due to the traffc as well as the environment and must be such as 
to make the mix suffciently workable and provide adequate strength and durability. 
The different properties that are relevant to the different applications and tests are presented next.

8.5 GRADATION FOR ASPHALT PAVEMENTS 
Gradation refers to the relative proportion of different sized particles in an aggregate blend. 
Gradation of a blend is determined from sieve analysis. Conversely, a blend can be separated 
into different sizes by sieving. Generally, in a quarry, the gradation of each stockpile aggregate 
material is determined frst, and then the gradations are analyzed to determine in what propor￾tion the aggregates from the different stockpiles can be combined to produce a specifc gradation. 
This gradation is generally specifed (in specifcations) by pavement project owners (such as state 
departments of transportation). The specifcations are developed on the basis of experience and 
results of laboratory and feld studies. Figure 8.2 shows a variety of gradations for dense graded 
asphalt mixes with the same nominal maximum aggregate size (NMAS), which is defned as 
one sieve size larger than the frst sieve to retain more than 10%. The maximum aggregate size 
is defned as one sieve size larger than the NMAS. The variation in gradation for the different 
NMASs is due to the fact that gradations are specifed to remain close to the maximum density 
gradation. 
Aggregate gradations are generally plotted on a 0.45 power chart, in which the abscissa is the 
particle size raised to the power 0.45 and the ordinate is the percent passing of any given sieve size 
in arithmetic scale. This chart has been developed through a series of studies that were conducted 
on achieving maximum strength and maximum density of aggregates (Fuller and Thompson, 1907; 
Campen, 1940; Talbot and Richart, 1923; Nijboer, 1948; Goode and Lufsey, 1962). The maximum 
density line is obtained by joining the 0% passing to the maximum aggregate size. Figure 8.2 shows 
the maximum density lines for the different NMASs in the FHWA 0.45 power plot. The maximum 
FIGURE 8.2 Different gradations and maximum density lines. 
Note: Sieve size raised to the power 0.45. 
ISTUDYAggregates for Asphalt and Concrete Mixes 209 
 
 
8.3 
density lines are based on the concept proposed by Fuller and Thompson (1907; also known as 
Fuller’s curve equation), which is as follows: 
° n
d ˙ P ˜ 100 *˝
˛ ˇ D ˆ
where 
P is the percentage passing 
d is the diameter of sieve 
D is the maximum size of the aggregate 
n is the coeffcient, frst proposed as 0.5 and then modifed to 0.45 
This line serves as a guide for the selection of aggregate gradations specifcally to avoid gradations 
that have too low VMA (Voids in Mineral Aggregates, see Section 12.1) (close to the maximum den￾sity line) or have tender/unstable behavior (cross the maximum density line at smaller sieve sizes). 
Aggregate gradation is the single most important factor in HMA design. A multitude of problems 
can appear if an appropriate gradation is not selected and/or used during production. Gradations close 
to the maximum density line have low VMA and are relatively more sensitive to changes in asphalt 
content. Mixes with gradations parallel to the maximum density line generally have low VMA due 
to tight packing of coarse and fne aggregates. Low VMA results in lower binder content, which 
leads to reduced workability and resistance to moisture damage, age hardening, and fatigue cracking. 
Tenderness is caused by instability, which can be due to excess fuid (asphalt or moisture) in the mix, 
humps in the fne aggregate portion of the gradation curve, or excess mat temperature. Tender mixes 
can be subjected to shoving or displacement of the mix during compaction. While tender mixes can 
be due to the presence of excessive amounts of round, smooth textured (natural) sand (which causes a 
noticeable hump between 0.6 and 0.15mm sieves), it can also be due to high sensitivity of the VMA to 
changes in asphalt content, insuffcient amount of fller, or excess amount of midsize fne aggregates 
(0.6–0.3mm). Movement of tender mix during compaction can lead to hairline cracks. The temperature 
range in which this problem has been observed is 65°C–115°C and may not be seen above or below this 
range. The mechanism of tender mix has been explained as pushing of the top portion of the mat over 
the bottom portion when the top part has cooled down and the middle and the bottom parts have not. 
A continuous maximum density gradation plot could be utilized to analyze gradation and evalu￾ate its deviation from the maximum density gradation line.

It can be used to compare similar gradations and determine changes in which sieve sizes could 
be made to have a more signifcant effect on VMA, if desired. An evaluation of the deviation 
and their effect on air voids and VMA can help the mix designer select the most appropriate 
blend of available aggregates from stockpiles to meet the volumetric requirements. Readers are

FIGURE 8.3 Gradations for different types of asphalt mixes. 
Several methods of developing gradations for providing aggregate interlock and adequate space 
for asphalt cement binder (to provide durability) have been developed. These methods, such as the 
voids in coarse aggregate (VCA) method as well as the Bailey method, are based on volumetric 
calculations with proper consideration of unit weight of individual aggregates. 
Gradations for different types of mixes are shown in Figure 8.3. Note that the gradations are 
different for different types of asphalt mixes, which are prepared for different applications. For 
common paving applications, dense graded mixes are used. To improve drainage of water and 
friction, open graded friction course (OGFC) is used; stone matrix asphalt (SMA) is used as a 
high-rut-resistant mix. The gap gradation (certain fractions missing) helps to achieve a high per￾meability in the OGFC mixes. In the case of SMA, the percentage passing the 4.75 mm sieve is 
important; it is kept at a relatively low number to allow the interlock of coarse aggregate particles 
and hence to develop a strong resistance against rutting. Note, however, that the percentage pass￾ing the 0.075 mm sieve is relatively high to provide a suffcient amount of fller material to stiffen 
the relatively large amount of asphalt binder used to provide a stable fne matrix and to prevent 
draindown of asphalt binder. 
8.5.1 AGGREGATE TESTS 
In the ASTM C 136: Standard Method for Sieve Analysis of Fine and Coarse Aggregates test, 
a weighed sample of dry aggregates is separated by running them through a set of sieves. The 
sieves are stacked in such a way so that the openings decrease from top to bottom. After separat￾ing the particles of the different sizes, the percentage of particle passing each sieve is calculated to 
determine the gradation or the particle size distribution. The weight of the test sample depends on 
the size of the aggregates used. Generally mechanical sieve shakers are used, which could impart 
vertical and lateral motion to the sieves during the sieving process. Guidelines for determining the 
adequacy of the sieving process are provided in the standard. Generally, 8 in. diameter round sieves 
ISTUDYAggregates for Asphalt and Concrete Mixes 211 
FIGURE 8.4 Stack of sieves in sieve shaker. 
are used. Dry sieve analysis provides an estimate of particle size distribution, whereas washed sieve 
analysis provides an accurate indication. A stack of sieves in a sieve shaker is shown in Figure 8.4. 
The steps required to combine aggregates from different stockpiles to produce a specifc grada￾tion are presented in Figure 8.5 with an example. 
Note that in an asphalt mix the surface of the aggregates is covered with asphalt binder. The total 
surface area of the aggregates dictates the amount of asphalt that is needed for covering the aggregates 
adequately, that is, as stated commonly, with an adequate flm thickness. Although the concept is 
purely theoretical, as there is no uniform or one flm thickness for the entire mix, it is a logical one 
and can be used to ensure an optimum “coating” of aggregates. Fine aggregates have larger surface 
area; blends with a higher amount of fne aggregates will have a higher surface area compared to 
those with a low amount of fnes. Relatively thin flms of asphalt can negatively affect the durability 
of the mix, whereas thick flms can adversely affect its resistance against rutting. An optimum flm 
thickness in the range of 8–12μm has been mentioned in the literature. 
The surface area of aggregates could be determined from surface area factors, as presented in 
Table 8.2. The factors are multiplied by the percentages and then added up. An example of calcula￾tion is also shown. For an alternative method, please see Nukanya et al. (2001). 
Aggregates have an important role in proportioning concrete. Aggregates affect the workability 
of fresh concrete tremendously. The aggregate particle size and gradation, shape, and surface tex￾ture will infuence the amount of concrete that is produced with a given amount of paste (cement 
plus water). The selection of the maximum size aggregate is governed by the thickness of the slab 
and by the closeness of the reinforcing steel. The maximum aggregate size should not be obstructed 
to fow easily during placement and consolidation. 
The maximum size of coarse aggregate should not exceed one-ffth of the narrowest dimension 
between sides of forms or three-fourths of the clear space between individual reinforcing bars or 
the clear spacing between reinforcing bars and form walls. For unreinforced slabs on grade, the 
maximum aggregate size should not exceed one-third of the slab thickness.

8.6 SPECIFIC GRAVITIES AND ABSORPTION 
The specifc gravity of a material is defned as the ratio of the weight of a unit volume of the 
material to the weight of an equal volume of gas-free distilled water at 23°C. This parameter is 
needed to calculate volumetric properties in a mix and any calculation that involves determination 
of mass from volume or vice versa. There are three different specifc gravities that could be used 
for determination of volumetric properties in asphalt mixes. The different specifc gravities are 
because of the effect of aggregate pores and absorption. The bulk and apparent specifc gravities 
are determined from the same test, whereas the effective specifc gravity is calculated. The appli￾cable ASTM standards are C-127 and C-182. Bulk and apparent specifc gravities are explained in 
Figure 8.6.

Effective specifc gravity is calculated from the theoretical maximum specifc gravity of asphalt mix. 
The absorption of an aggregate is defned as the water content of the aggregate in its saturated 
surface dry condition: 
Saturated surface dry weight of aggregate, g ° oven dried weight of aggregate, g Absorption, ˜ 8.8 
Oven dried weight of aggregate, g
This parameter is needed to determine how much of the total asphalt added is absorbed in the 
aggregates and how much remains on the surface of the aggregate as effective asphalt. Generally, 
the water absorption of aggregates is determined and used as an indicator of the asphalt absorption. 
The AASHTO T 84 (ASTM C 128) Specifc Gravity and Absorption of Fine Aggregates test 
procedure consists of the following steps. About 1000 g of oven-dried fne aggregate is immersed 
in water in a fask (pycnometer) with known weight. After 24 h of immersion, the aggregate is dried 
on a fat surface, using warm air, until saturated surface dry (SSD) condition is reached. The SSD 
condition is detected at that moisture content when a lightly compacted mass of fne aggregate in a 
cone frst slumps when the cone is removed. About 500 g of the SSD aggregate is then placed in the 
fask and weighed. The fask is then flled with water, and its weight is recorded. Finally, the fne 
aggregate is removed from the fask, oven dried, and weighed. 
In the AASHTO T 85 (ASTM C 127) Specifc Gravity and Absorption of Coarse Aggregates test 
procedure, about 5kg of washed coarse aggregate (retained on a 4.75mm sieve) is oven dried, weighed, 
and then immersed in water for 24h. The aggregates are then removed from water, drained, and surface 
dried (saturated surface dry) until there is no visible flm of water on the surface and then are weighed 
again. The SSD aggregates are next submerged underwater in a wire-mesh basket and weighed. 
The absorption of the aggregate blend (combined coarse and fne aggregates) is determined on 
the basis of a percentage of the two fractions. Maximum limits on absorption are specifed, which 
may range from 0.5% to 5%.

8.7 CLEANLINESS AND DELETERIOUS MATERIALS 
Deleterious or undesirable materials can be of different types, such as organic materials, vegeta￾tion (roots, sticks), clay lumps, clay coating on aggregates, and metal oxides. Such impurities are 
undesirable since they negatively affect the performance of asphalt mixtures. For example, organic 
materials can absorb water and lead to the deterioration of the mix; clay lumps can form during 
production and subsequently disintegrate in the asphalt mix; clay dust can coat aggregates and nega￾tively affect the bond between asphalt and aggregate; metal oxides can react with water and cause 
swelling, popouts, and staining in pavements. Petrographic examination can identify impurities in 
many cases, and washing the aggregates reduces the impurities to a great extent. However, tests 
must still be conducted to ensure that the aggregates are clean to a minimum acceptable level and/ 
or the amount of impurities is below a maximum acceptable level. 
In the AASHTO T 176 (ASTM D 2419) Plastic Fines in Graded Aggregates and Soils by Use of 
the Sand Equivalent test, aggregates passing the 4.75mm sieve are placed and stirred in a gradu￾ated, transparent cylinder flled with water and a focculating agent (a mixture of calcium chloride, 
glycerin, and formaldehyde). After settling, the sand in the fne aggregate separates from the clay, if 
any; the heights of the sand and clay columns in the fask are read off; the ratio of the former to the 
latter is determined as the sand equivalent. Depending on the layer, minimum sand equivalents are 
specifed, which can range from 25 to 60. 
The AASHTO T 90 (ASTM D 4318) Determining the Plastic Limit and Plasticity Index of Soils 
test involves the determination of a liquid limit, a plastic limit, and the plasticity index (PI), which is 
the difference between the liquid limit and the plastic limit, for materials passing the 0.42mm sieve. 
Maximum limits on PI (such as 4) are specifed on either the fraction passing the 0.42 mm sieve or 
that passing the 0.075mm sieve. 
In the AASHTO T 112 (ASTM C 142) Clay Lumps and Friable Particles in Aggregates test, 
washed aggregates are dried and sieved to remove the fraction passing the 0.075 mm sieve. 
Samples are then soaked in water for 24 h, after which particles are tested for removal by wet 
sieving and breaking with fngers. If a particle can be removed by wet sieving or breaking, it 
is classifed as a clay lump or friable particle, and the total percentage of such particles on the 
basis of the weight of the sample is determined. Maximum limits, such as 1%, are generally 
specifed. 
The AASHTO T 113 Light Weight Pieces in Aggregate test involves the determination of the per￾centage of lightweight pieces in coarse and fne aggregates by separating (foating) them in a liquid 
of suitable specifc gravity. Liquid such as zinc chloride solution (specifc gravity = 2.0) can be used 
to separate particles such as those of coal. 
The steps in the AASHTO T 11 Material Finer than 75 μm (No. 200 Sieve) in Mineral Aggregate 
by Washing test are washing and wet sieving aggregates to determine the percentage of material 
passing the 75 μm sieve. Allowable ranges of material fner than 75 μm are generally specifed, and 
depending on the layer and type of mix, they can range from 2% to 10%. 
In the AASHTO T P57 Methylene Blue Value test, a sample of material passing the 75 μm sieve is 
dispersed in distilled water using a magnetic stirrer, and the methylene blue solution is titrated into 
the dispersed mix until the sample cannot absorb any more reagent. This end point is indicated by 
a blue ring when a drop of the mix is placed on a flter paper. The methylene blue value (amount, 
MBV) is proportional to the amount of organic material or clay in the aggregate, and a maximum 
limit is generally specifed. 
8.8 TOUGHNESS OR RESISTANCE AGAINST ABRASION LOSS 
For both asphalt and concrete mixes, the resistance against degradation (breaking down of larger 
particles into smaller sizes) by abrasion, or toughness, can be measured by the Los Angeles (LA) 
abrasion (also sometimes referred to as the LA degradation) test. 
ISTUDY 
 
218 Pavement Engineering 
FIGURE 8.7 Micro-Deval equipment. 
In the AASHTO T 96 (ASTM C 131) Resistance to Degradation of Small Size Coarse Aggregate by 
Abrasion and Impact in the Los Angeles Machine test, a 5000g blend sample of coarse aggregate is 
placed in a steel drum containing 6–12 steel balls (each weighing 420g). The drum is rotated for 500 
revolutions at a speed of 30–33rpm, and during this time the steel balls and aggregates are lifted and 
dropped about 69cm from a shelf within the drum. The tumbling action leads to the shattering of brittle 
particles by impact and degradation of smaller particles by surface wear and abrasion. At the end of 
tumbling, the aggregates are sieved dry over a 1.70mm sieve (through which none of the aggregates 
passed before the sieve), and the percentage of the material passing this sieve is reported as the Los 
Angeles degradation value. A high value would indicate the potential of the generation of dust and 
breakdown during construction and in the feld, although it may fail to identify such potential in light￾weight aggregates such as slag. Maximum limits are specifed and may range from 30% to 50%. Values 
may range from 10 (for aggregates from hard igneous rock) to 60 (for aggregates from soft limestone). 
The ASTM D 6928, AASHTO T P58 Micro-Deval Abrasion Loss test consists of placing aggregates 
in a jar with water and 3/8in. diameter steel balls and rotating the jar (Figure 8.7) at 100rpm for 2h. The 
breakdown of the aggregate is then evaluated. The aggregate sample is soaked in water for 24h before 
tumbling in the jar. At the end of the tumbling, the sample is washed and dried, and the amount of mate￾rial passing the No. 16 sieve is determined. This value is then used as a percentage of the original sam￾ple weight to determine the percentage of abrasion loss. A maximum limit, such as 18%, is specifed. 
8.9 PARTICLE SHAPE AND SURFACE TEXTURE 
Angular particles tend to provide greater interlock and internal friction (and hence shear strength), 
and particles with rough texture (as found mostly in crushed aggregates) are desirable because of 
increased strength and voids for accommodating more asphalt (and hence more durability). Also, 
the occurrence of fat and/or elongated particles is undesirable because they affect compaction and 
tend to increase voids, break down during construction and under traffc, produce particles with 
uncoated (with asphalt) surfaces, and negatively alter the volumetric properties. 
For coarse aggregates, the ASTM D 3398 Index of Aggregate Particles Shape and Texture test 
can be used. The volume of voids between packed, uniform-size particles is an indicator of the 
combined effect of shape, angularity, and surface texture of the aggregates. Clean, washed, and 
oven-dried aggregates are separated into different sizes, and aggregates of each size are compacted 
in a separate mold with a tamping rod using frst 10 blows per layer of three layers and then 50 blows 
per layer of three layers. The voids are determined from the weight of the mold with the aggregate 
and the bulk-specifc gravity of the aggregates. The particle index is calculated for each fraction, 
and then a combined index is calculated on the basis of the relative proportion (percentage of the 
blend by weight) of the different sizes: 
Ia ˜ 1 2. 5V ° 0 25. V ° 32 0. 8.9 10 50
ISTUDYAggregates for Asphalt and Concrete Mixes 219 
 
where 
Ia is the particle index value 
V10 is the percentage voids in the aggregate compacted with 10 blows per layer 
V50 is the percentage voids in the aggregate compacted with 50 blows per layer 
Particle index values of blends may range from 6 (for rounded aggregates with a smooth surface) to 
20 (for angular crushed aggregates with a rough texture). For the same air voids, mixes with aggre￾gates with a higher particle index value tend to show higher strength. 
The ASTM D 4791 Flat or Elongated Particles in Coarse Aggregates test is also used. Flat or elon￾gated particles are defned as those aggregates by particles that have a ratio of width to thickness or 
length to width greater than a specifed value, such as 3:1, 4:1, or 5:1 (most common). Tests are conducted 
on particles of each size using a proportional caliper, on a representative sample, and then the total value 
is calculated as a percentage in terms of number or mass. Maximum limits on the percentages of fat and 
elongated particles are specifed, which may range from 5 to 20, for example, for a ratio of 5:1. 
The ASTM D 5821 Determining the Percentage of Fractured Particles in Coarse Aggregates test 
involves the determination of percentage of coarse aggregates (that are retained on the 4.75mm sieve) 
with one or more fractured face(s), which is defned as a face that exposes the interior surface of a 
particle. A particle is said to have a fractured face if, for example, at least 25% of the area (ASTM stan￾dard) of the face is fractured. During the test, from a specifc sample, the aggregate particles identifed 
as those with fractured faces are separated from those that are not, and the percentage of particles with 
one (or two) fractured faces is determined. Minimum limits on the percentage of fractured particles in 
an aggregate blend are specifed and may range from 30 to 90, for both one and two or more fractured 
faces, dependent on the layer, with surface layers having requirements for higher percentages. 
In the AASHTO T P56 Uncompacted Voids in Coarse Aggregates test, coarse aggregate is 
dropped through a hopper into a cylinder with a known weight and volume. The excess aggregate 
on top of the cylinder is struck off, and the weight of the flled cylinder, along with the known bulk￾specifc gravity of the aggregates, is used for determination of the uncompacted void content. 
For fne aggregates, the ASTM C 1252, AASHTO TP 33, Uncompacted Void Content test is used 
(Figure 8.8). The test consists of pouring the fne aggregate blend of specifed gradation through 
a funnel into a cylinder with a volume of 100 cm3. The cylinder is weighed after striking off the 
excess particles. Using this weight, the bulk-specifc gravity of the aggregate, and the known vol￾ume and weight of the cylinder the uncompacted void content is determined. A high uncompacted 
void content of, say, 45% indicates a fne aggregate with angular shape and rough texture and tends 
to produce asphalt mixes with a relatively high resistance against the potential of rutting.

8.10 DURABILITY/SOUNDNESS 
Aggregates could be subjected to repeated cycles of weathering action due to wetting and drying 
or freezing and thawing of trapped water (due to expansion upon freezing). Tests are conducted to 
determine the potential of breakdown when subjected to such stresses. 
In the AASHTO T 104 (ASTM C 88) Soundness of Aggregate by Use of Sodium Sulfate or Magnesium 
Sulfate test, the sample is immersed in a solution of sodium or magnesium sulfate of specifed strength 
for a period of 16–18h at a temperature of 21°C±1°C. The sample is removed from the solution and 
drained for 15±5min, and then dried at 110°C±5°C to a constant weight. During immersion, the sul￾fate salt solution penetrates into the permeable pores of the aggregate and drying dehydrates the sulfate 
salts in the pores. Upon further immersion, the sulfate salts rehydrate, and the resulting expansion and 
stress simulate the freezing of water and associated stress. The same sample is then subjected to four 
more cycles (for a total of fve cycles) of immersion and drying. The sample is then sieved, and the 
weight loss for each fraction and then the weighted average loss of the sample is determined. A higher 
loss indicates a potential of loss of durability through weathering actions of the environment. Maximum 
limits (such as 12% loss after fve cycles) are specifed. 
There are three different versions of the AASHTO T 103 Soundness of Aggregate by Freezing 
and Thawing test. In procedure A, samples are immersed in water for 24 h and then subjected to 
freezing and thawing, while in procedure B the samples are vacuum (25.4mm of mercury) saturated 
using a 0.5% (by mass) solution of ethyl alcohol and water before being subjected to freezing and 
thawing (in the same solution). Procedure C is similar to B, except that water is used instead of the 
alcohol-water solution. Samples are dried and sieved at the end of the fnal cycle (cycles may range 
from 16 to 50 cycles, depending on the procedure), and the weight loss for each size is determined. 
In the AASHTO T 210 (ASTM D 3744) Aggregate Durability Index test, a washed and dried 
sample of coarse aggregate is agitated in water for a period of 10min. The washed water and frac￾tion passing the 75 μm sieve are mixed with calcium chloride solution and placed in a plastic sand 
equivalent cylinder for 20min. Next, the level of the sediment column is read, which is used for 
calculating the durability index. 
8.11 EXPANSIVE CHARACTERISTICS 
Expansion of aggregates (such as steel slag) as a result of hydration can lead to swelling in asphalt 
mixes and results in disintegration of asphalt pavements. Tests can be conducted to identify the 
potential of expansion. 
The ASTM D 4792 Potential Expansion of Aggregates from Hydration Reaction test method 
involves compaction of the aggregate to its maximum density in a CBR mold and submerging it in 
water at 71°C ± 3°C for a period of at least 7 days. A perforated plate is kept on top of the compacted 
aggregate. Percentage expansion of the sample is determined from dial readings of the height of the 
sample submerged in water and the initial height of the sample. Maximum permissible expansion, 
such as 0.5%, is specifed. 
8.12 POLISHING AND FRICTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS 
Polishing is defned as the loss of microtexture and the gradual smoothing and rounding of exposed 
aggregates. High potential of polishing in aggregates by traffc is undesirable as it leads to lower￾ing of friction and a decrease in skid or frictional resistance, which is a measure of how quickly a 
vehicle can be stopped, say, under adverse/wet conditions. 
In the AASHTO T 278 (ASTM E 303) Measuring Surface Frictional Properties Using the British 
Pendulum Tester test, aggregate particles are placed in a small mold along with a bonding agent 
(such as epoxy). A thin flm of water is applied over the sample, and then a pendulum with a rubber 
shoe is released such that it touches and goes over the sample. The pendulum goes past the sample 
to a certain height depending on the friction offered by the aggregate sample. This height, or the 
ISTUDYAggregates for Asphalt and Concrete Mixes 221 
 
length of the arc, is read off. This zero-polishing reading is then used, along with readings taken 
after polishing the sample surface (for, say, 9h) with a British polish wheel (AASHTO T 279 and 
ASTM D 3319) or other polishing device, to determine the polishing resistance. 
In the ASTM D 3042 Insoluble Residue in Carbonate Aggregate test, the percentage of noncarbon￾ated (acid insoluble) materials in carbonate aggregates is determined. Five hundred grams of a sample 
(retained on a 4.75mm sieve) is placed in a glass beaker with 1L of hydrochloric acid solution, and the 
mix is agitated until effervescence stops. This is repeated with an additional 300mL of acid. Then the 
beaker is heated to 110°C with new acid added in increments until effervescence stops. Next, the aggre￾gate residue is washed over a 75μm sieve, the plus-75-μm material is weighed, and the weight is expressed 
as insoluble residue (as a percentage of the original sample weight). The higher the amount of insoluble 
residue, the higher the amount of siliceous material and the higher the resistance against polishing. 
8.13 AGGREGATE TESTS SPECIFICALLY FOR CONCRETE 
8.13.1 FINENESS MODULUS (ASTM C 125) 
This property assesses the coarseness of the fne aggregate, and it is used in combination with the 
maximum nominal size coarse aggregate to estimate the proportions of both fne and coarse aggre￾gates used in a concrete mix to satisfy workability requirements. The fneness modulus (FM) is 
calculated by summing the cumulative percentage retained in the following sieves and dividing the 
sum by 100: 9.5, 4.75, 2.36, 1.18, 0.6, 0.3, and 0.15 mm. It usually varies between 2.5 and 3.1. The 
higher the FM, the harsher and rougher the concrete mix is. However, it is more economical to have 
a mix with a higher FM because the mix will not require as much water, and therefore, a relatively 
lower amount of cement could be used for a specifc water-cement ratio. 
8.13.2 GRADATION 
The gradation requirements for aggregates used in concrete are provided in ASTM C 33 and 
AASHTO M 80 for coarse aggregates and ASTM C 33 and AASHTO M 6 for fne aggregates. 
These gradations assist the designer in providing a workable concrete in which the coarse aggre￾gates are coated and suspended in the mortar (sand, cement, and water). The gradations differ on the 
basis of nominal maximum size of the coarse aggregate. The maximum aggregate size is defned as 
the smallest sieve through which 100% of the aggregate passes. The nominal maximum aggregate 
seize is defned as the smallest sieve that can retain up to 15% of the aggregates. The larger the 
maximum size, the greater the percentage of coarse aggregates in a mix. The limits are imposed by 
the thickness of the slab and the gap between the reinforcements, if any. Figure 8.9 shows examples 
of gradations for coarse and fne aggregates along with ASTM limits.

8.13.3 BULK DENSITY AND VOIDS IN AGGREGATES TEST 
The Bulk Density and Voids in Aggregates (AASHTO T 19; also known as the dry-rodded unit 
weight) test is conducted for the volumetric mix design of PCC. The steps in this are flling a con￾tainer with a known volume (0.5 ft3
) with dry coarse aggregate using a specifed procedure, and then 
measuring the weight of the flled container and determining the bulk density by dividing the weight 
of the aggregates needed to fll the container by the volume of the container. 
8.14 AUTOMATED AGGREGATE ANALYSIS (AASHTO TP 81 AND PP 64) 
Modern imaging systems and image analysis software are being used to develop automated aggre￾gate image analysis for determining aggregate properties. Figure 8.10 shows one such piece of 
equipment. Both coarse and fne aggregate could be analyzed, and texture for coarse aggregate 
could also be determined. The system consists of a hardware that captures the 3D image of aggre￾gate particles and software that analyzes the image and estimates the angularity, form, and texture. 
8.15 ARTIFICIAL AGGREGATES 
Artifcial aggregates are those that are not naturally occurring but rather are formed from waste 
products or as by-products of industrial processes. The feasibility of producing lightweight aggre￾gates (synthetic lightweight aggregates, or SLA, weighing less than 70 lb/ft3
) suitable for use in 
pavements, from waste fy ash and mixed waste plastics, has been proven. Such products are gener￾ally formed through intense heating of several materials, such as heating shale/clay/slate in excess 
of 1000°C to produce ceramic SLA. Slag, a by-product of the iron and steel industry, is used in 
pavement mixtures and is noted for its good skid resistance (and relatively high absorption). Blast 
furnace (or iron) slags, most widely used in the pavement industry, are formed as a by-product in 
FIGURE 8.10 Automated aggregate imaging system.

ISTUDYAggregates for Asphalt and Concrete Mixes 223 
blast furnaces, whereas steel slags are formed in basic oxygen and electric arc furnaces. While blast 
furnace slag is lighter than natural aggregates, steel slags are heavier. The light weight of the blast 
furnace slag provides the advantage of fewer truckloads for the same volume of materials. Steel 
slags, on the other hand, have a high angle of internal friction, and are very suitable for rut-resistant 
pavement layers. The National Slag Association at www.nationalslag.org provides excellent infor￾mation on this topic.

9 Asphalt and Emulsions 
9.1 ASPHALT BINDER 
In the United States, asphalt refers to the binder, also known as bitumen. Asphalt can refer to a 
mixture of bitumen and aggregates (as in Europe), which is usually called asphalt mix in the United 
States. In this book, the U.S. defnition will be followed—asphalt will mean the binder. 
NCHRP Synthesis 511 (Daly, 2017) provides an excellent discussion of relationships between 
the chemical makeup and the engineering performance of asphalt. Asphalt is a material that is 
made up of predominantly hydrocarbons; small amounts of sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen; and trace 
amounts of metals such as vanadium, nickel, iron, magnesium, and calcium. Analysis of a typi￾cal asphalt would indicate the following: carbon, 82%–88%; hydrogen, 8%–11%; sulfur, 0%–6%; 
oxygen, 0%–1.5%; and nitrogen, 0%–1%. Asphalt consists of nonpolar aliphatic hydrocarbon and 
aromatic rings. Aliphatic hydrocarbons can be aliphatic or paraffnic molecules, hydrogen saturated 
rings, or naphthenic molecules. Aromatic rings are unsaturated rings which may have benzene 
or naphthalene. The range in size of the molecules in asphalt consists of 20 to 150 carbon atoms 
(molecular weight 300—2,000). 
The cost of crude oil and coking technology infuence asphalt supply which dictates asphalt cost. 
Earlier, distillation was conducted at refneries above 550oC, and 40% residuum or asphalt was obtained. 
In recent times, through hydrocracking, more lighter products are obtained, and 12–15% asphalt is 
obtained. Asphalt is no longer considered to be a by-product. The crude oil source dictates the largest 
size of the hydrocarbon, while the processing conditions dictate the smallest size. The crude source dic￾tates the polar components of the polycyclic molecules of the aromatic ring. The nonpolar components 
are the solvents or dispersing agents of the polar components which dictates compatibility. 
Traditional techniques of determination of composition of asphalt consist of UV (ultraviolet 
spectroscopy), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) 
and MS (mass spectroscopy). FTIR is being increasingly used for identifcation of carbonyl and 
sulfoxides that are formed due to aging and also for the detection of the presence of polymer in 
polymer-modifed binder. Techniques that help understand the effect of molecular interaction in 
asphalt on performance consists of TGA (thin layer chromatography), DTA (differential thermal 
analysis), GPC (gel permeation chromatography), SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and AFM 
(atomic force microscopy.) 
Traditionally “penetration,” “viscosity,” and “shear modulus” tests have been used to character￾ize asphalts. While discussing different types of asphalt, results from one of these tests are provided 
to make a relative comparison of the “softness/hardness” or “stiffness” of the material. In layman’s 
language, the higher the penetration or the lower the viscosity/modulus, the “softer” the asphalt 
binder is and vice versa. 
9.2 NATURALLY OCCURRING ASPHALTS 
Asphalt can be obtained in different forms, although refned asphalt from fractional distillation 
of crude oils is the most commonly used. The naturally occurring asphalts are lake asphalts, rock 
asphalt, and gilsonite. 
9.2.1 LAKE ASPHALT 
The primary source of lake asphalt is a deposit in a lake in the southern part of Trinidad. This 
asphalt has been deposited as a result of surface seepage in the bed of the lake. Asphalt is excavated 
ISTUDY 
226 Pavement Engineering 
from the lakebed and transported to various places. This asphalt is a mixture of different materials, 
including pure asphalt binder. This asphalt is also known as Trinidad lake asphalt (or TLA). The 
refnement of the excavated material is done by heating it to 160°C and vaporizing the water. The 
material is then sieved to remove large-size/other particles and organic matter. This refned product 
has about 54% binder, 36% mineral matter, and 10% organic material. TLA has a penetration of 
about 2mm with a softening point of 95°C. This material was once used alone or in combination 
with softer asphalt for regular use in asphalt pavement construction. These days, its use is confned 
to mostly high-stiffness asphalt mixes for pavements and roofng applications. 
9.2.2 ROCK ASPHALT 
Rock asphalts are obtained from rocks that are impregnated with asphalts. They are formed by 
the entrapment of asphalt in impervious rock formations. These asphalts are obtained from mines 
or quarries. Their deposits can be found in Switzerland, France, and Italy, as well as in Utah and 
Kentucky in the United States. The concentration of asphalt in such deposits can range from 7% to 
13%. Although used in some of the earliest roads in Europe and the United States, it is used very 
little at present, mostly in waterproofng and high-stiffness asphalt mix applications. 
9.2.3 GILSONITE 
Gilsonite is found in Utah in the United States. It has a penetration of zero with a softening point of 
115°C–190°C. It is used in combination with regular asphalt to alter its characteristics to reduce the 
penetration and increase its softening point. Its use is mostly limited to bridge and waterproofng 
applications and high-stiffness asphalt mixes. 
9.3 REFINED ASPHALT FROM CRUDE OIL 
Refned, regularly used asphalt for paving applications is produced from crude oil. Crude oil is formed 
as a result of the action of heat from within the earth’s crust and weight of many layers of deposits 
of remains of marine organisms and vegetation over millions of years. Natural gas and oil reservoirs 
are detected by surveys and recovered by drilling through impermeable rocks. The oil is produced in 
mainly four regions of the world—the Middle East, Russia, the United States, and Central America. 
The characteristics of the crude oil differ signifcantly from source to source. Of the 1500 different 
sources of crude oils in the world, only a few are actually found to be suitable for obtaining asphalt. 
Asphalt is manufactured from crude oil starting with a process called fractional distillation. 
This process separates the different hydrocarbons with different boiling points that make up crude 
oil. Fractional distillation is carried out in tall steel towers. The crude oil is frst heated in a fur￾nace to a temperature around 350°C, and the mix of liquid and vapor is then directed to the lower 
part of the tower, which has a pressure greater than the atmospheric pressure. The vapors rise up 
in the tower through holes in the horizontal layers that divide the tower vertically into segments. 
The vapors lose heat as they rise through the holes in the trays. When the temperature of the vapor 
falls below its boiling point, it condenses and the liquid that accumulates in one of the trays is then 
drawn off. The lightest fractions of the crude oil that remain as vapor are taken off from the top of 
the tower and include propane and butane. Further down the tower, kerosene and then gas oil are 
recovered. The heaviest fraction (long residue) that comes from the bottom of the tower is a complex 
mixture of hydrocarbons and is distilled again at a reduced pressure (10–15 mmHg and 35°C–45°C) 
in a vacuum distillation tower. One of the products of this step is the short residue, which is used 
as the feedstock for producing different grades of asphalt. As the viscosity of the short residue is 
dependent on the source of the crude oil and the temperature and pressure during the process, the 
conditions are adjusted on the basis of the source of the crude oil to produce an asphalt with a pen￾etration in the range of 35–300 dmm (1 dmm is 0.1 mm). 
ISTUDYAsphalt and Emulsions 227 
 
 
Air blowing or oxidation is used to modify the proportion of the short residue at a temperature of 
240°C–320°C. The result of such oxidation is a decrease in penetration, increase in softening point, 
and decrease in temperature susceptibility. Such modifcation, which can be in continuous, semi, or 
full (oxidation) mode, results in the formation of asphaltenes and an increase in size of the existing 
asphaltenes. 
The three processes that take place are oxidation, dehydrogenation, and polymerization. In the 
continuous blowing process, the penetration and softening point of the asphalt depend on the viscos￾ity of feedstock, temperature in the blowing column, residence time in the blowing column, origin 
of the crude oil, and air-to-feed ratio. Fully blown or oxidized asphalts are produced by vigorous air 
blowing or by blending with relatively soft fux. 
The properties in this case are dependent on the viscosity and chemical nature of the feed. The 
specifc grade of asphalt is produced by selecting a suitable feedstock, controlling viscosity of the 
feed, and the conditions in the tower. 
9.4 SAFE DELIVERY, STORAGE, AND HANDLING OF ASPHALTS 
Considerations must be made regarding delivery, storage, and handling of asphalts to make sure that 
adequate safety is maintained, and that asphalt properties are not adversely affected. The safety fac￾tors are discussed frst, followed by factors that could affect asphalt properties adversely. 
9.4.1 CAUSES OF HAZARDS AND PRECAUTIONS 
The main hazard from asphalt results from the fact that it is usually applied at high tempera￾tures, which facilitate the emission of fumes of hydrocarbons and H2S (the amount doubles for 
every 10°C–12°C increase in temperature). Exposure to even small amounts of H2S is fatal. 
Although relatively very high temperatures are required for spontaneous burning of asphalt 
(400°C), small amounts of H2S from asphalts can react with rust on tank walls to form iron 
oxide. This material reacts readily with O2 and can self-ignite and also ignite carbonaceous 
deposits on the roof and walls of the tank. Also, if water comes in contact with hot asphalt, it is 
converted into steam, and foam is produced in the asphalt with a volume increase of approxi￾mately 1400 times. In order to prevent these three hazardous conditions, the following steps 
must be taken: 
1. Test areas where H2S may be present, and check if they are gas-free before entering. 
2. Openings in asphalt tanks such as areas to roofs should be restricted, and the manhole 
should be kept closed to prevent entry of O2. 
3. Prevent water from entering asphalt tanks. 
9.4.2 HEALTH HAZARDS 
Some benzene compounds are found in polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), which are pres￾ent in crude oils—however, the concentration in asphalt that is refned from crude oil is very low. 
Intimate and prolonged skin contact of asphalt as well as asphalt emulsion should be avoided to 
prevent risk of irritation of skin and eyes. 
Specifc instructions on how to treat skin for frst, second, and third degree burns; eye burns; 
and inhalation should be clearly displayed and available in areas where asphalt is handled. Under 
normal working conditions, exposure to particulate asphalt, hydrocarbons, and H2S that are emitted 
during heating of asphalt is well below allowable maximum limits. However, inhalation can cause 
usually temporary irritation to the eyes, nose, and respiratory tract; headache; and nausea. Such 
exposure should be minimized, and if it occurs, the affected person should be removed to fresh air 
and, if necessary, given medical attention as soon as possible. 
ISTUDY 
 
228 Pavement Engineering 
9.4.3 PRECAUTIONS AND GOOD PRACTICES 
Proper equipment should be used for protecting against burns from hot asphalt. Standard gear 
includes helmet and neck aprons, heat-resistant gloves, safety boots, and overalls. Soiled garments 
should be replaced/dry cleaned as soon as possible. Persons handling asphalts can use barrier creams 
to help subsequent cleaning for which only approved skin cleaners and warm water should be used. 
Personnel should be properly equipped and trained to handle fres should one break out. Direct 
water jets should not be used since they may cause foaming and spread the hot asphalt. Dry chemi￾cal powder, foam, vaporizing liquid, or inert gases can be used to extinguish small fres. Portable 
fre extinguishers must be placed at strategic, permanent, and conspicuous areas. The local fre sta￾tion should be consulted to formulate a plan if initial efforts fail to extinguish a fre. 
Spills and splashes of hot asphalt should be avoided during sampling. Sampling areas should be 
well lit and have safe in and out areas, and adequate protective clothing must be worn. Sampling 
by dipping a weighted can should be done for only small samples and be avoided for cutback tanks 
because of the presence of fammable atmosphere in tank vapor spaces. The best way is to use prop￾erly designed sample valves from pipelines and tanks. The proper sample valve remains hot by the 
product so that there is no blockage in closed position, and also such that the plunger of the valve 
extends into fresh asphalt and allows obtaining fresh liquid asphalt when opened. 
Regarding leaching of components from asphalt, it has been shown that prolonged contact with 
water leads to leaching of PACs, but the levels reach equilibrium rapidly and the numbers are one 
order of magnitude below the limits of potable water. 
Users of asphalt (laboratories, plants, and job sites) should review materials safety data sheets 
and follow all Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards such as the 
OSHA Hazard Communication Standards (e.g., 29 CFR 1910.1200; see www.ilpi.com/msds/ 
osha/1910_1200.html). 
9.5 ASPHALT BINDER PROPERTIES 
Since asphalt binders are by-products of the petroleum distillation process, by nature, if heated to 
a very high temperature, they can give off vapors that can get ignited and pose safety hazards in 
plants. They can also become stiffer at low temperatures and relatively soft at high temperatures. 
Furthermore, asphalts lose components through volatilization as well as oxidation, when exposed to 
air/oxygen and/or high temperature, and as such, they may undergo a drastic change in properties. 
In fact, asphalts tend to become “harder” with time—what is commonly known as age hardening. 
Therefore, tests have been developed to characterize asphalts in terms of their relevant properties, 
such as those just described—safety, temperature susceptibility, and age hardening. These tests are 
presented in the following. 
9.5.1 SPECIFIC GRAVITY: ASTM D 70 
The specifc gravity of a material is defned as the ratio of the mass of the material at a given tem￾perature to the mass of an equal volume of water at the same temperature. For asphalt binder, the 
ASTM D 70 procedure, Density of Semi-Solid Bituminous Materials (Pycnometer Method), is used 
for the determination of specifc gravity and density. In this procedure, a calibrated pycnometer with 
a sample of known weight is frst weighed and then flled with water. The setup is then brought to 
the test temperature and weighed. The density (specifc gravity × density of water) is then calcu￾lated from the mass of the sample and the water displaced by the sample in the pycnometer, and the 
specifc gravity is calculated. Note that the density of gas-free distilled water varies between 999.1 
and 997 kg/m3 between a temperature of 15°C and 25°C. If the density of water is approximately 
taken as 1 gm/cm3, then the density is numerically equal to specifc gravity. The specifc gravity of 
the asphalt is expressed along with the temperature at which both asphalt and water were used in 
ISTUDYAsphalt and Emulsions 229 
 
 
 
 
the test. Specifc gravity is used in converting weight to volume and vice versa, in paying asphalt 
suppliers/contractors, as well as in determining the effective specifc gravity of aggregate. 
9.5.2 CLEVELAND OPEN CUP METHOD (FLASH POINT): ASTM D 92 
This test involves heating the asphalt in a brass cup, and passing a small fame over the cup periodi￾cally, until a quick fash occurs. The temperature at which the fash occurs is called the fashpoint. 
It is conducted to determine the temperature range that can be used during the production of HMA 
without causing safety hazards. 
9.5.3 SOLUBILITY TEST: ASTM D 2042 
In this test, a sample of asphalt is mixed with a solvent and then poured through a glass fber pad 
flter. The retained impurities are washed, dried, and weighed. This test is run to minimize the pres￾ence of such impurities as dust and organic materials in the asphalt. 
9.5.4 SPOT TEST: AASHTO T 102 
In this test, visual evaluation of a drop of asphalt and solvent mix on a flter paper is made. Results 
are reported as acceptable or not acceptable based on the absence or presence of a dark area in the 
spot on the flter paper. This test was developed to identify asphalts that have been damaged due to 
overheating (cracking—molecules thermally broken apart) during the asphalt production process. 
9.5.5 PENETRATION: ASTM D 5 
In this test, a container of asphalt maintained at 77°F is placed under a needle. The needle, under 
a weight of 100g, is allowed to penetrate the asphalt in the container for 5s. The depth of penetra￾tion, expressed in dmm, is reported as the penetration. The purpose of this test is to classify asphalt, 
check consistency, and evaluate the overheating of asphalt. Generally fve different grades are avail￾able: 40–50, 60–70, 85–100, 120–150, and 200–300. A 60–70 grade means an asphalt binder that 
has a penetration value ranging from 60 to 70 dmm is harder than the 85–100 grade and softer than 
the 40–50 grade. A binder with a lower penetration grade such as 40–50 would be used in a project 
in a warmer location, whereas those with higher grades (such as 120–150) would be used in a project in 
a colder region. 
9.5.6 VISCOSITY TESTS 
Viscosity is defned as the ratio of applied shear stress to shear strain. It can be measured by direct 
tests (such as a sliding plate viscometer), but it is generally measured by indirect procedures. This 
test helps in measuring the resistance of the asphalt to fow. Two types of viscosity tests are gener￾ally run: absolute viscosity, expressed in poise, fow in vacuum (ASTM D 2171 and AASHTO T 
202) at 140°F, and kinematic viscosity, expressed in centistokes, by gravity fow (ASTM D 2170 and 
AASHTO T 201) at 275°F. 
In the absolute viscosity test, a sample of asphalt is introduced through one side of a capillary 
tube, maintained in a bath at 140°F. After reaching 140°F, the asphalt is made to fow by applying 
a vacuum on the other side of the tube, and the time to fow through two marked points in the tube 
is measured. The time is then used, along with the calibration constant of the tube, to determine the 
viscosity. 
The kinematic viscosity test is similar to the absolute viscosity test, but runs at a higher tem￾perature at which the asphalt is suffciently fuid to fow. A different type of tube is used for this 
test, and after reaching the test temperature, only a small vacuum is applied on the other side of 
ISTUDY 
 
b
230 Pavement Engineering 
the tube to initiate the fow of asphalt due to gravity. The kinematic viscosity is then determined 
by multiplying the time taken by the asphalt to fow between two timing marks and the calibration 
factor of the tube. 
Viscosity tests are used for classifcation of asphalts (absolute viscosity), as well as on condi￾tioned asphalts to evaluate overheating/overaging of asphalt. ASTM D 3381 presents the specifca￾tions for the different types of viscosity-graded asphalt. Viscosity grades are generally expressed as 
an AC, followed by a number expressing its viscosity divided by 100. For example, an AC 20 asphalt 
binder means a binder with absolute viscosity of 2,000 P. Generally higher viscosity asphalts are 
used in warmer climatic regions, and lower viscosity materials are used in colder regions. 
Kinematic viscosity is used to determine suitable mixing and compaction temperature for 
HMA. An equiviscous temperature (temperature at which viscosities are similar) is used for mixing 
and compacting different types of mixes such that the effect of the asphalt can be made uniform. 
Generally, the viscosity for mixing and compaction is specifed as 170± 20 and 280± 30 cSt (for 
mixing and compaction, respectively; Asphalt Institute, 1984). Generally, the absolute viscosity is 
determined at 60°C and the kinematic viscosity is measured at 135°C, and then a plot of tempera￾ture (in Rankine) versus kinematic viscosity (log-log) is plotted with two data points, one with the 
measured value at 135°C and another one calculated from the absolute viscosity at 60°C as follows:

ASTM D 2493 provides viscosity temperature charts for asphalts. The two charts in this stan￾dard have the following ordinates and abscissa respectively: logarithm of logarithm of viscosity in 
mPa.S and logarithm of absolute temperature in degree Kelvin (degrees C + 273.2) and logarithm 
of logarithm of viscosity in centipoise and logarithm of absolute temperature in degrees Rankine 
(F + 459.7). 
9.5.7 SOFTENING POINT (RING AND BALL) TEST: ASTM D 36 
This test is conducted to determine the temperature at which asphalt starts fowing. This test involves 
the placement of a steel ball over a ring of asphalt in a bath and heating the assembly at 5°C/min. 
The temperature at which the asphalt cannot support the ball anymore and sinks is reported as the 
softening point. This is not used for paving asphalts that much but is used for roofng asphalts. 
9.5.8 FRAASS BREAKING POINT TEST: BS EN 12593, BS 2000-8 
This test is conducted to determine the very low temperature stiffness of an asphalt binder. In this 
test, a steel plate coated with a thin layer of asphalt binder is slowly bent and released repeatedly 
while the temperature is reduced constantly at the rate of 1°C/min until the asphalt binder cracks. 
9.5.9 DUCTILITY: ASTM D 113 
In this test, a sample of asphalt is stretched until it breaks or until the testing equipment limit is 
reached. The asphalt sample is stretched at a rate of 5 cm/min at 77°F, and the ductility is measured 
in cm. If run at a lower temperature, the rate of stretching is reduced. This test is run to ensure the 
use of nonbrittle asphalts.

9.5.10 THIN FILM OVEN TEST (TFOT): ASTM D 1754 
This is a conditioning procedure in which a 50 g asphalt sample is placed in a fat-bottom pan on a 
shelf in a ventilated oven maintained at 325°F. The shelf is rotated at 5–6 revolutions/min for 5h. 
The loss in penetration or increase in viscosity as well as change in weight of the sample are usually 
measured after the heating. The use of this test is to evaluate the effect of heat and air on asphalts 
and identify those that would harden excessively due to volatilization and/or oxidation. 
9.5.11 ROLLING THIN FILM OVEN TEST (RTFOT): ASTM D 
2872, BS EN 12591, AASHTO T 240 
In this test, eight bottles with asphalt are placed in a rack inside an oven maintained at 325°F (Figure 9.1), 
and the rack is rotated around a heated air-blowing orifce for 75 min. As the rack rotates, asphalt

binder inside each bottle fows inside, exposing the fresh surface to the air. The mass loss and 
viscosity after this process is checked. This test is run to classify asphalts (aged residue, or AR, 
process) and to ensure minimization of mass loss and a change in properties. 
9.6 ASPHALT BINDER PROPERTIES AND PAVEMENT 
DISTRESS AND PERFORMANCE 
For asphalt pavements, rutting at high temperature and cracking at low temperature are the two 
primary topics of interest regarding asphalt. During the production of HMA and during its life on 
the pavement, the asphalt could become too brittle. It is important to select an asphalt that would 
not become too brittle because of the asphalt itself, because of the mix components, or because of 
construction. Hence, there are several factors that must be checked to ensure this, such as the prop￾erties of asphalt, using the TFOT, using the correct amount of miner fller (aggregates < 0.075 mm 
in diameter) in the mix, and compacting the HMA to a minimum density such that the voids are 
below a maximum allowable level. 
9.6.1 AGING OF ASPHALT BINDER 
The composition of asphalt binder is affected by air (oxygen), ultraviolet radiation, and fuctuations 
in temperature. The primary effect is the hardening or stiffening of the asphalt binder, both during 
the production process as well as during the service life of the pavement. This hardening needs to 
be “predicted” and taken into consideration during the selection of the asphalt binder, since exces￾sive hardening of the binder increases the potential of cracking of asphalt mixes. Hardening of the 
binder takes place on the surface of the pavement as well as in the mix inside the pavement. 
Different mechanisms, caused by the different environmental factors, are responsible for the 
hardening of asphalt binder. Although 15 different factors have been identifed (as listed in the fol￾lowing), the frst four are considered to be the more important ones: 
1. Oxidation in the dark 
2. Volatilization 
3. Steric or physical factors 
4. Exudation of oils 
5. Photooxidation by direct light 
6. Photooxidation in refected light 
7. Photochemical reaction by direct light 
8. Photochemical reaction by refected light 
9. Polymerization 
10. Changes by nuclear energy 
11. Action of water 
12. Absorption by solid 
13. Absorption of components at a solid surface 
14. Chemical reactions 
15. Microbiological deterioration. 
The four important factors are explained as follows: 
1. Oxidation: Asphalt binder components oxidize and form heavier and more complex mol￾ecules, increasing the stiffness and decreasing the fexibility. The rate of oxidation is 
affected by the temperature and the asphalt binder flm thickness, with higher temperature 
and thinner flms facilitating oxidation. For temperatures above 100°C, the rate of oxida￾tion doubles for every 10°C increase in temperature. 
ISTUDYAsphalt and Emulsions 233 
2. Volatilization: Depending on the temperature and the surface area exposed, the asphalt 
binder loses lighter components by volatilization. 
3. Steric or physical hardening: Reorientation of molecules and slow crystallization of waxes 
are responsible for causing steric hardening of asphalt binder at ambient temperatures. 
4. Exudation of oils: Depending on its chemical nature as well as the porosity of the aggre￾gate, oils from the asphalt binder are exuded into the aggregates in an asphalt mix to a 
different extent. 
The hardening of asphalt occurs at different extents and because of different factors during stor￾ing, during mixing (during production), and in the pavement. When stored inside a tank in bulk and 
not exposed to oxygen, very little hardening occurs, even at high temperatures. Proper layout of 
storage tanks should be used to ensure avoiding exposure of a larger surface area of asphalt binder 
to oxygen during circulation of the binder in the tank. During the mixing process, asphalt binder 
is subjected to a relatively high temperature and is spread over aggregates in flms with thickness 
generally ranging from 5 to 15 μm. The time of mixing can be different for different types of mix￾ing plants (shorter for drum plants, and hence shorter exposure to oxygen and less hardening effect 
on the asphalt binder), and for specifc asphalt binder selected, the temperature and the amount of 
asphalt should be controlled properly to make sure that the asphalt flm is of suffcient thickness 
to minimize hardening. Hardening increases with a decrease in flm thickness. If the asphalt mix 
is stored in a silo, some hardening will take place as a result of the introduction of air along with 
the mix. The silo should, therefore, be airtight, and as full as possible to minimize the presence of 
air. Air within the silo may be removed by the introduction of inert gases, and any oxygen inside 
the silo could also react and form carbon dioxide and prevent further oxidation. If no fresh air is 
allowed inside the silo during storage, very little or no oxidation could occur between this time and 
transportation and laydown. 
It is important to note that any gain in lowering the viscosity of the asphalt binder by overheat￾ing the binder during mixing will be lost by the subsequent increased rate of oxidation and resulting 
high viscosity, and the increased viscosity will be detrimental to the performance of the asphalt mix. 
The hardening of the asphalt binder during storing, mixing, transportation, and laydown is 
grouped under short-term aging, whereas the hardening of the asphalt binder in the pavement, dur￾ing its service life is called long-term aging. This hardening is primarily affected by the amount of 
air voids in the compacted asphalt mix in the pavement. Since a higher amount of air voids would 
introduce a higher amount of air, oxidation and hardening can be minimized by providing adequate 
compaction and lowering voids, preferably below 5%. In practice, it may not be possible to compact 
to such an extent to lower the voids below 5% for all types of asphalt binder, and in general the 
average air voids of dense graded mixes are kept below 8%. Mixes with similar air voids may not 
have the same rate of hardening if the distribution of air voids in the mixes is different—mixes with 
interconnected voids would have higher air permeability and a faster rate of hardening. 
Note that the hardening of the asphalt binder in the asphalt mix on the surface of the pavement 
occurs at a faster rate than that of the asphalt binder in the mix inside the pavement because of the 
relatively higher amount of oxygen available, higher temperatures, and photo-oxidation by ultra￾violet radiation. This top oxidized layer of asphalt could be eroded by water and, while present, 
could prevent further oxidation. However, adequate thickness of the asphalt flm should be ensured 
through the provision of an adequate amount of asphalt binder. Generally, thicker flms (i.e., higher 
asphalt content) are provided for compacted asphalt mixes with relatively high amounts of air voids. 
Optimum flm thickness can range from 9 μm to above 12μm for dense and open graded asphalt 
mixes, respectively. 
Note that while excessive hardening of the surface mix is always detrimental to the performance 
of the pavement, the hardening of binder resulting in the increase in stiffness of the asphalt mix base 
course (“aging”) is also considered to be a benefcial effect with respect to the structural design of 
the pavement.

9.6.1.1 Hardening 
There are parameters, based on penetration and viscosity tests, that could be used to evaluate the 
“hardening” of asphalt due to volatilization as well as oxidation. 
Penetration after TFOT Retained penetration = 9.2 
Penetration before TFOT
Viscosity after TFOT Viscosity ratio = 9.3 Viscosity before TFOT
In order to ensure good performance of an asphalt pavement, the temperature susceptibility of 
asphalt must be controlled since it is always desirable to have an asphalt that would possess suf￾fcient stiffness at a high temperature to prevent rutting and possess suffcient ductility at a low 
temperature to prevent cracking. 
There are three parameters that could be used to measure temperature susceptibility of asphalts: 
the penetration index (PI), the pen-vis number (PVN), and viscosity temperature susceptibility 
(VTS), as explained next: 
20 ° 500A Penetration index (PI) ˜ 9.4 1 5 ˛ 0A
Log p° enetration at T ˛ ˝ Log p° enetration at T ˛ A ˜ 1 2 9.5 
T T 1 ˝ 2
The PI of asphalt generally ranges between −1 and +1, and a higher PI indicates lower temperature 
susceptibility. 
° Pen-vis number (PVN) ˜ L X ˛°1 5. ˝ 9.6 
L m°
where 
L is the log of viscosity at 275°F for PVN = 0.0 
m is the log of viscosity at 275°F for PVN = −1.5 
X is the log of viscosity at 275°F 
Typical values of the PVN range between −2 and 0.5, and a higher PVN indicates a lower tempera￾ture susceptibility. 
Log l˜ og viscosity at T2 ° ˛ Log˜log viscosity at T1 ° Viscosity-temperature susceptibility (VTS)= 9.7 
Log T1 ˛ Log T2
Typical values of VTS range from 3.36 to 3.98. The lower the VTS, the lower the temperature 
susceptibility. 
9.7 STIFFNESS 
A signifcant amount of research has been conducted on defning, measuring, and evaluating stiff￾ness of asphalt. Some of these are indirect, while the rest are direct measurement techniques, 
although the approach varies signifcantly. One method is to determine the stiffness of the asphalt 
from the stiffness of the mix from the nomograph shown in Figure 9.2.

Association Research and Education Foundation.) 
Another of the earliest developed methods is the use of the softening point (ring and ball test) and 
the PI, as shown in Figure 9.3. 
Van der Poel, who developed this procedure, showed that for the same time of loading, two 
asphalt binders with the same PI have the same stiffness at temperatures that are equidistant from 
their respective softening points. A modifcation of this method is to use the corrected PI and the 
corrected softening point, which is done as follows. The penetration is measured at three tempera￾tures, and the corrected PI (pen/pen) is determined from the plot of temperature versus penetration 
on the bitumen test data chart (BTDC). The BTDC is a chart that can be used to present penetration, 
softening point, Fraass breaking point, and viscosity data on the same chart. The chart (Figure 9.4), 
with two horizontal scales for the temperature and Fraass breaking point, and two vertical scales 
for penetration and viscosity, is prepared in such a way that data from asphalt binders with “normal” 
temperature susceptibilities plot as straight lines on the chart.

The corrected softening point is determined from the point at which the extended penetration 
straight line and the 12,000 poise ordinate on the BTDC intersect. A further modification of the 
process is the use of the PVN instead of the PI, as shown in Figures 9.5 and 9.6.
9.7.1 visCosity for stiffness
For asphalts, the viscosity parameter is often used as a measure of stiffness, using the definition 
of absolute viscosity—the ratio of shear stress to the rate of shear. A large number of viscometers 
have been developed over the years, which may be of rotational or capillary tube or sliding plate 
type. While high-temperature (> 140°F) viscosity is suitably measured with a capillary tube-type 
ISTUDYAsphalt and Emulsions 239 
 
viscometer, as mentioned earlier, for low temperatures cone and plate viscometers and sliding plate 
viscometers are most widely used. 
In the sliding plate viscometer, a sample of asphalt is sandwiched between two plates, one of 
which is clamped to a frame. A load applicator needle is placed onto the asphalt sample, using an 
adapter. At the start of the test, the support beneath the asphalt sample and the unclamped plate is 
removed, and the asphalt sample is subjected to shearing load. The shearing stress and the shear 
displacement, as measured by a transducer, are used to determine the viscosity of the asphalt. 
9.8 VISCOELASTIC NATURE OF ASPHALT AND 
DIRECT MEASUREMENT OF STIFFNESS 
The viscoelastic nature of an asphalt mix comes primarily from the viscoelastic behavior of the 
asphalt binder. Depending on the temperature and rate of loading, an asphalt binder could behave 
as an elastic material or as a viscous material or in a way that refects both its elastic and viscous 
nature. At low temperatures and short periods of loading the response is elastic, whereas at high 
temperature and long periods of loading the response is viscous. At intermediate temperatures and 
periods of loading, asphalt binders show viscoelastic behavior. The lag between the shear stress and 
shear strain (Figure 9.7) is called the phase angle, δ, and can range from 0, for a perfectly elastic 
material, to 90° (one-quarter of a cycle) for a perfectly viscous material. 
Several models that have been developed by researchers capture the dependence of asphalt binder 
stiffness on temperature and periods of loading. 
Conceptually, this can be expressed as follows: 
° Stiffness, St,T ˜ 9.8
˛ t,T
where 
St,T is the stiffness at loading time t at temperature T 
σ is the stress 
ɛt,T is the strain at loading time t at temperature T 
The stiffness relevant for asphalt binder is related to shear failure. To determine stiffness or modulus 
related to shear failure, one needs to measure shear stress and shear strain. The shear stress during 
a test can be applied in different ways to be consistent with the specifc mode of failure in the pave￾ment. For example, it can be applied as a sinusoidal wave (dynamic loading to simulate the effect of 
traffc), with varying stress, using a constant amplitude and frequency, or the load can be applied as

a constant load for a long period of time (as in a creep test to simulate the effect of the environment). 
The shear modulus can be determined as the ratio of shear stress to strain at a specifc frequency. 
Note that the frequency is related to the period or time of loading. Under dynamic conditions of 
loading, the stiffness (or modulus) is equal to three times the shear modulus. 
The dynamic tests could be conducted for shorter loading periods and creep tests for longer load￾ing periods, and the combined test data could be used for obtaining stiffness versus loading-time 
information over the range of loading times expected in a pavement (Figure 9.8). Note that stiffness 
versus loading time plots for a specifc asphalt binder obtained at different temperatures would coin￾cide if shifted by different factors on the same plot. This property of asphalt binder is often referred 
to when asphalt binders are said to be “thermorheologically simple.” 
9.9 TENSILE BEHAVIOR 
The behavior of asphalt binder in tension is usually expressed in terms of two parameters: break￾ing stress and strain at failure. At a higher stiffness, the strain at failure is a function of the elastic 
modulus. High stress due to low temperatures occurs when the asphalt binder has a relatively high 
stiffness and the strain at failure is very low. The strain at failure at a specifc temperature can be 
predicted from the PI, the softening, and a specifc time of loading.

In the toughness and tenacity test (Figure 9.9), which is similar to the tensile strength test, the 
stress to cause the elongation as well as the area under the stress/strain curve are determined. 
Generally this test is useful for polymer-modifed asphalt binders. The test results show two distinct 
areas under the stress/strain curve—the relatively small one under the beginning to the yield point 
of the asphalt, and the second larger area under a milder peak and prolonged elongation. The area 
of total curve (frst and second combined) is called toughness, whereas the area under the second 
(large) part, which comes mainly from the contribution of the polymer modifcation, is known as 
the tenacity. 
9.10 SUPERPAVE (SUPERIOR PERFORMING ASPHALT PAVEMENTS) 
Superpave is the HMA mix design system that resulted from the $150 million, 5-year-long Strategic 
Highway Research Program (SHRP) in the United States between 1987 and 1993. The major objec￾tives behind the development of Superpave were to identify and defne properties of asphalt binders, 
aggregate, and hot mix asphalt that infuence pavement performance and develop test methods for 
performance-based specifcations. Even though research continues to improve the Superpave sys￾tem, at present, the Superpave system is being used by most of the state departments of transporta￾tion in the United States. 
The major elements of Superpave are (1) Superpave performance-graded (PG) asphalt binder 
specifcations, (2) aggregate properties, and (3) the Superpave mix design and analysis system. The 
asphalt binder specifcations and tests are described in the following paragraphs. 
The two major outcomes in the area of asphalt binder specifcations are the introduction of 
performance-related tests and the shift from the traditional approach of testing asphalt at the same 
temperature for different specifed values of test results to testing asphalt at different temperatures 
for the same specifed values of test results. The new tests relate to three asphalt binder charac￾teristics—temperature susceptibility, viscoelastic behavior, and age hardening. The condition of 
the asphalt binders during the tests simulates the condition of the asphalt binder at supply, during 
production of HMA, and in service in the pavement. The modes of failure for which the asphalt 
binder characteristics are specifed include rutting and cracking (temperature and fatigue related). 
Several relatively new asphalt tests are used routinely now or are being implemented as a result of 
the introduction of the Superpave system (Anderson and Kennedy, 1993; McGennis et al., 1994).

9.10.1 HIGH-TEMPERATURE VISCOSITY 
High-temperature viscosity measurements, such as those required for the determination of suitable 
mixing and compaction temperature and to check for suitability of pumping during mixing, can 
be conducted with a rotational viscometer. The test consists of rotating a spindle with a sample 
of asphalt binder maintained at the test temperature, measuring the torque required to maintain a 
constant rotation speed, and calculating the viscosity from this measurement. For plotting the kine￾matic viscosity versus temperature data, this test could be used to determine the viscosities at 135°C 
and 165°C (and avoid the need to convert absolute viscosity to kinematic viscosity, as discussed 
earlier). Kinematic viscosity is measured in centipoises and reported in the Pa-s (SI) unit, and the 
viscosities used for determining the equiviscous temperatures are 0.17 ± 0.02 Pa-s for mixing and 
0.28± 0.03 Pa-s for compaction. The different parameters used for the calculation of kinematic 
viscosities are as follows.

Note that the feld compaction temperature should be based on the aforementioned guidelines but 
adjusted according to a number of factors such as air and base temperature, wind speed, haul dis￾tance, roller type, and lift thickness. One excellent tool for simulating different conditions and deter￾mining appropriate compaction temperature is the PaveCool software developed by the Minnesota 
Department of Transportation (2000–2006; www.dot.state.mn.us/app/pavecool/). 
9.10.2 COMPLEX MODULUS AND PHASE ANGLE 
The dynamic shear rheometer (DSR; test method: AASHTO T 315; see Figure 9.10) is used to 
characterize the viscoelastic behavior of asphalt binder and evaluate its rutting and cracking poten￾tial. The basic principle used for DSR testing is that asphalt behaves like elastic solids at low 
temperatures and like a viscous fuid at high temperatures. These behaviors can be captured by 
measuring the complex modulus (G*) and phase angle (δ) of an asphalt binder under a specifc 
temperature and frequency of loading. The G* and δ parameters (Figure 9.10) are measured by 
the DSR by applying a torque on the asphalt binder between a fxed and an oscillating plate and 
measuring the resultant strain. G* is defned as the ratio of shear stress to shear strain, and δ is the 
time lag between the stress and the strain in the asphalt binder. These properties are determined at

high and intermediate pavement service temperatures. The high temperature is determined from 
the average of maximum HMA pavement temperature over a 7 day period through summer, which 
is obtained from data from weather stations. The intermediate testing temperature is determined 
from an average of 7 day average maximum and minimum design temperature. Figure 9.11 shows 
results of DSR tests conducted on different asphalts at different temperatures. Dividing G* by the 
angular velocity (10 rad/s used in DSR testing), one can obtain complex dynamic shear viscosity 
from DSR tests.

9.10.3 aging tests
Short-term aging is done by subjecting the asphalt binder to the rolling thin film oven (RTFO) test, 
explained earlier. Long-term aging is simulated with the use of the pressure aging vessel (PAV; 
ASTM D 6521, AASHTO R 28; Figure 9.12). The PAV test consists of subjecting the RTFO residue 
to high pressure and temperature inside a closed vessel. The PAV is placed inside an oven for main￾taining the specified high temperature, and a cylinder of clean, dry compressed air is used to supply 
and regulate air pressure.
9.10.4 dsr tests ConduCted on aged asPhalt
The asphalt binder in its unaged condition, short-term aged condition (RTFO conditioned), and 
long-term aged condition (PAV conditioned) is tested with the DSR for evaluation of its rutting and 
fatigue characteristics. The rutting potential is evaluated by the rutting factor, defined as G*/Sin d, 
of which G* and d can be obtained from DSR testing. Since higher G* means greater resistance to 
rutting, and lower d means a more elastic asphalt binder, higher G* and lower d values are desirable 
to make the HMA less susceptible to rutting. Considering rutting as a stress-controlled and cyclic

loading phenomenon, it can be shown that the rutting potential is inversely proportional to G*/Sin δ. 
Hence, a minimum limit is set on the value of G*/Sin δ. Testing asphalt for the rutting factor prior 
to long-term aging is critical because with aging the stiffness of the asphalt binder increases and 
resistance to rutting increases (Bahia and Anderson, 1995). Hence, the DSR test for rutting poten￾tial is conducted on RTFO residue. It is also conducted on unaged asphalt binder because in some 
cases RTFO may not indicate the actual aging of the binder during the production and placement 
of HMA. 
The asphalt binder is also tested with the DSR to determine the fatigue cracking potential of 
HMA. The fatigue potential is measured by the fatigue factor, defned as G* Sin δ. This is done 
because it can be shown that under a strain-controlled process, the work done for fatigue is propor￾tional to G* Sin δ, and hence a lower value of G* Sin δ means a lower potential of fatigue cracking. 
This can be explained by the fact that as G* decreases, the asphalt binder becomes less stiff and 
is able to deform without building up large stresses, and as δ value decreases, the asphalt binder 
becomes more elastic and can regain its original condition without dissipating “energy.” An upper 
limit is set on the G* Sin δ value in the Superpave specifcation in order to minimize the potential of 
fatigue cracking (Bahia and Anderson, 1995). Since the asphalt binder becomes stiffer due to aging 
during its service life and becomes more susceptible to cracking, the DSR test for fatigue factor 
determination is conducted on PAV aged samples. 
9.10.5 LOW-TEMPERATURE STIFFNESS (ASTM D 6648, AASHTO T 313) 
The bending beam rheometer (BBR) is used to evaluate the stiffness of an asphalt binder and its 
cracking potential at low temperature. The BBR (Figure 9.13) consists of a loading mechanism in 
which an asphalt binder beam is subjected to a transient creep load at a constant low temperature. 
The creep stiffness and the rate at which the stiffness changes with loading time give an indica￾tion of its cracking potential at the test temperature. The higher the stiffness (s), the lower the rate 
(m), and the greater the potential for cracking. A lower slope or rate of change in stiffness means a 
reduced ability of the asphalt binder to relieve thermal stress by fowing (relaxation). Hence, in the 
Superpave specifcation, a maximum limit is set on the value of stiffness, and a minimum limit is 
ISTUDY 
 
246 Pavement Engineering 
FIGURE 9.13 Bending beam rheometer. 
set on the value of slope. Since the asphalt binder becomes stiffer with aging and more susceptible 
to thermal cracking, the BBR test is conducted on PAV aged samples. 
9.10.6 DIRECT TENSION TEST (ASTM D 6723, AASHTO T 314) 
In some cases, such as modifed binders, a measure of stiffness is not adequate to characterize the 
cracking potential. This is because these binders may have a higher stiffness, but they may not be 
susceptible to cracking, as they are more ductile and can stretch without breaking. The direct ten￾sion test (DTT; Figure 9.14) is used to characterize such binders. It is used for testing any binder 
that has a stiffness exceeding the specifed stiffness at low temperatures. The DTT consists of a 
tensile-testing machine, which measures the strain at failure of a dog bone shaped asphalt binder 
specimen, which is subjected to tensile load at a constant rate. A minimum limit is set on the strain 
at failure. 
9.10.7 SUPERPAVE REQUIREMENTS 
In the Superpave system of specifcations, the requirements for results from tests on asphalt binders 
are the same. However, the temperature at which the requirements are met is used to classify the 
asphalt binder. For example, a binder classifed as PG 64-22 means that the binder meets high-tem￾perature physical property requirements up to a temperature of 64°C, and low-temperature physical 
property requirements down to -22°C. There is also a provision of using higher grade asphalt (e.g., 
PG 76–22) for mixes to be used in slow transient or standing load areas.

A specifc asphalt is classifed (according to the PG classifcation system) through the following 
steps: 
1. Check fashpoint (minimum = 230°C). 
2. Check viscosity (ASTM 4402) at 135°C; maximum: 3 Pa-s. 
3. Check at which highest temperature, for the neat asphalt, G*/Sin δ ≥ 1.00 kPa, when tested 
with the DSR at 10 rad/s; note temperature (high pavement temperature: 46/52/58/64). 
4. Run RTFOT (AASHTO T 240) or TFO (AASHTO T 179). 
5. Check mass loss; maximum: 1.00%. 
6. Check at which highest temperature, for the RTFOT/TFO aged asphalt, G*/Sin δ ≥ 
2.2kPa, when tested with the DSR at 10 rad/s; note temperature (high pavement tempera￾ture: 46/52/58/64). 
7. Run pressure aging vessel test with the RTFOT/TFO aged binder at 90°C for PG 46/52 (as 
identifed earlier), 100°C (58/64/70/76/82), and 110°C (desert climate, 70/76/82). 
8. Check at which temperature, for the RTFOT/TFO-PAV aged asphalt, G* Sin δ ≤ 5000 
kPa, when tested with the DSR at 10 rad/s; note temperature (intermediate pavement ser￾vice temperature: 10/7/4 for PG 46, 25/22/19/16/13/10 for PG 52, 25/22/19/16/13 for PG 
58, 31/28/25/22/19/16 for PG 64, 34/31/2825/22/19/16/13 for PG 70, 37/34/31/28/25/22 for 
PG 76, and 40/37/34/31/28 for PG 82). 
9. Check lowest temperature at which the S value is ≤ 300 MPa and m value is ≥ 0.300 in the 
test BBR run for 60 s (low pavement temperatures: −36 to 0, in 6° decrements). 
10. If stiffness exceeds 300 MPa in Step 9, run DTT and check minimum temperature at 
which failure strain is ≥ 1%, when run at 1.0 mm/min (low pavement temperatures: −36 to 
0, in 6° decrements).

FIGURE 9.15 Plots of complex modulus and phase angle versus temperature for different grades. (a) 
Complex modulus (G*) versus temperature (°C) and (b) phase angle (δ) versus temperature. 
For continuous grading of the asphalt binder, the procedures presented in ASTM D 7643-16 
(Standard Practice for Determining the Continuous Grading Temperatures and Continuous 
Grades for PG Graded Asphalt Binders) should be followed. 
To illustrate the concept, Figure 9.15 is presented. It shows the complex modulus and phase 
angles at different temperatures for different asphalt grades. Note that the lower the high-tempera￾ture grade, the lower the complex modulus, and the higher the phase angle at a specifc temperature. 
Also note that the PG 82-22 binder is a polymer-modifed binder, and hence shows signifcantly 
different properties than the rest. Generally, asphalt binders with high range (range means the dif￾ference between the high and low temperatures) are polymer modifed. 
The asphalt binder to be used in a specifc project is selected on the basis of the geographical 
location of the project, the pavement temperature and air temperature, and the specifc reliability 
that the user wants to have in selection of the binder. The process is illustrated next.

9.10.7.1 Explanation 
The steps in the software are as follows. A high-temperature algorithm is used for the determina￾tion of the high-temperature PG. An equation, developed from a database of pavement tempera￾tures and rutting damage, is used to determine a PG damage (PGd, or a “base PG” with 50% 
reliability at the surface layer), then an estimate of variability of pavement temperature (CVPG) is 
obtained using an equation, and the base PG is adjusted for any other desired level of reliability. 
Finally, the PG is adjusted for any other depth of the pavement, using another equation. Note that 
the determined PG grade is valid for fast-moving traffc with a design volume of three million 
equivalent single-axle loads (ESAL), and that adjustments (known as grade bumping) could also 
be made to accommodate other traffc volumes and speed. The adjustment factor (a calculated 
ISTUDY250 Pavement Engineering 
average for different PG, traffc volume, and speeds), shown in Table 9.1, needs to be added to the 
base PG to determine the design PG:

Table 9.2 shows the different grades of asphalts generally available in the United States. Note 
that higher range asphalt binders are mostly modifed binders (such as with polymer, discussed in 
Chapter 23) and grades wider than the typical ranges presented in the table can be produced for spe￾cialty applications. Polyphosphoric acid (PPA) is often used (generally up to a maximum of 1.5%) to 
stiffen asphalt binders. The stiffening effect is dependent on the specifc asphalt binder and its crude 
source. PPA can increase the moisture sensitivity of certain binders; however, it has been reported 
that such increased sensitivity can be counteracted with the use of lime treatment of aggregates. 
The use of PPA can enhance the cross-linking and performance of styrene butadiene styrene (SBS) 
polymer in asphalt modifcation.

FIGURE 9.16 Calculations for parameters from the MSCR test. 
The steps in testing and evaluation of a binder are as follows: 
1. Use 10 creep/recovery cycles for stress levels of 0.1 and 3.2 kPa—each cycle consisting of 1 s 
loading and 9 s recovery. Determine two parameters—the nonrecoverable creep compliance, 
Jnr, and (percentage of) recovery—average of results from 10 cycles for each stress level. 
2. From the test data, determine Jnr values at 0.1 and 3.2 kPa shear stress and the correspond￾ing MSCR recovery values at the same stress levels. 
3. With the data from the 3.2 kPa shear stress portion of the test, plot the MSCR recovery as 
a function of Jnr, and compare with Figure 9.17. If the data points lie above the curve, then 
the inference is that there is suffcient delayed elastic response for an elastomeric-modifed 
asphalt binder. 
4. Calculate stress sensitivity parameter, Jnr,diff, from 
J ˜ ˛Jnr, . 3 2 kPa ° Jnr 1 , . 0 kPa ˝ nr,diff 9.15 Jnr, . 0 1 kPa
5. If Jnr,diff > 0.75, then the asphalt binder is considered to be stress sensitive; a maximum ratio 
of 0.75 is permitted by AASHTP M332; it is to be reported if the MSCR is being used with 
AASHTO M 320. 
The implementation of this test is through AASHTO M 332, which is required by state DOTs for 
polymer modifed binder. In this system no grade bumping is required, but the impact of traffc is 
considered through the recognition of the level of traffc—S (standard, < 10 million ESALs), H 
(heavy, 10–30 million ESALs), V (very heavy, > 30 million ESALs or standing traffc), E (extreme, 
> 30 million ESALs and standing traffc), and the corresponding requirements of Jnr (< 4.5, 1, 2, 0.5 
kPa-1, for S, H, V, and E type, respectively). 
Currently, states in the United States are working on adopting the MSCR criteria in place of 
the Superpave high temperature/rutting criteria (minimum G*/Sin δ) because of primarily two 
reasons—the MSCR parameter is better correlated to rutting, and its adoption will eliminate the 
need for grade bumping, which often results in improper use of base asphalt and polymer content.

9.11 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
Observations of premature low temperature cracking and the difference in performance of pave￾ments with binders from different crude sources but the same PG grade has led to a number of 
research and developments. Three recent developments in asphalt binder characterization include 
the use of Black Space diagram (King et al., 2012), the Glover cracking parameter (Glover et al., 
2005), and that of ΔTc. In the Black Space diagram the complex modulus, G* (y) is plotted as a func￾tion of the phase angle, δ (y). Results from different unmodifed asphalts show that the plots shift left 
with aging—that is, the asphalts exhibit lower phase angle with aging. This shift has been related 
to the onset of damage such as raveling and block cracking in asphalt pavements, specifcally due to 
premature aging. In the past the propensity of such failures has been related to the loss of ductility 
of asphalt binders. The ductility at 15 C and 1 cm/min (below 10 cm) has been found to be strongly 
correlated to the G′/(η′/G′) parameter, commonly referred to as Glover’s cracking parameter, where 
G′ and η′ are the storage modulus and dynamic viscosity values, respectively. The Gʹ/(ηʹ/Gʹ) values 
have been found to increase (decrease in ductility) with an increase in aging of the binders.

Ductility values of 5 and 3 cm have been reported to be indicative of impending cracking (warning) 
and cracking (limit), respectively (Kandhal, 1977). The corresponding critical Gʹ/(ηʹ/Gʹ) values are 
9.00E−04 and 3.00E−03 MPa/s, respectively. Note that the DSR measurements for Glover’s crack￾ing parameter were done at 15°C and 0.005 rad/s (time-temperature shifted to 44.7°C and 10 rad/s). 
Research has shown that the use of limiting stiffness (from BBR) test becomes less accurate as a 
binder becomes more “m” (slope from BBR test) controlled with aging. In “m” controlled binders the 
failure (low) temperature at the critical m value (0.30) is higher than the failure temperature predicted 
by the limiting stiffness (300 MPa). The two failure or critical temperatures can be found as follows:

The difference in these two values (T and T ) has been found to increase with an increase in c,m c,s 
aging—indicating a loss of relaxation properties. This difference (termed as ΔTc, Anderson et al., 
2011) has also been found to have a good relationship with ductility (ductility = 7.77e−0.27(ΔTc); 
R2 = 0.74). The warning and critical cracking limits for ΔTc (derived from the relationship with 
Gʹ/(ηʹ/Gʹ) have been reported to be 2.5 and 5.0°C, respectively. Note that the ΔTc is determined from 
BBR tests (which may be run at three test temperatures to avoid extrapolation) on PAV aged sam￾ples. Recent work has suggested the use of samples aged for 40 h (twice the duration of PAV aging) 
in BBR for the determination of ΔTc, since the rate of aging has been seen to increase signifcantly 
after the frst PAV aging period and not increase after 40 h of aging. 
Th Glover-Rowe (G-R) parameter (Rowe, 2011, AASHTO T 315) is based on the master curve at 
15oC and 0.005 rad/s conditions. Higher values indicate a higher potential of feld cracking caused 
by brittleness. Values of 180 kPa and 600 kPa indicate limits for onset and signifcant cracking 
potential, respectively.

9.12 RECOVERY OF ASPHALT BINDER FROM ASPHALT MIX 
The asphalt binder from an asphalt mix could be recovered for testing with the help of the solvent 
extraction method using a rotary evaporator (Figure 9.18). The asphalt mix is mixed with a solvent 
(such as methylene chloride) to remove the asphalt binder from the aggregates to the solution. In 
FIGURE 9.18 Rotary evaporator used for extraction of asphalt binder. 
ISTUDY256 Pavement Engineering 
FIGURE 9.19 Ignition test equipment.

the next step, the mineral fller and very fne aggregates are separated from the solution by fltration 
and centrifuging. In the fnal step, the asphalt binder-solvent mix is heated in a fask maintained at 
a specifc temperature in an oil bath, such that the solvent is evaporated and condensed elsewhere, 
while the pure asphalt binder remains in the fask. If the asphalt binder is not required for testing, 
then the amount of asphalt binder present in a mixture of asphalt and aggregate can be determined 
by the use of the ignition test (AASHTO T 308, Determining the Asphalt Binder Content of Hot 
Mix Asphalt [HMA] by the Ignition Method), in which the mix is heated to a very high temperature 
(500°C–600°C) to burn the asphalt off, and the difference between the initial and fnal weight of the 
mix is determined (Figure 9.19), using appropriate calibration factors for burnt aggregates. 
9.13 ADHESION PROPERTIES 
The primary function of the asphalt binder is to bind the aggregate particles together or work as an 
adhesive. The aggregate-asphalt binder adhesion is affected by a number of factors, and if not con￾sidered carefully, water can destroy it and adversely affect pavement performance. These factors are 
related to the properties of the aggregate, the asphalt binder, and the asphalt mix. External factors, 
such as rainfall and temperature, are also important. 
The surface energy concept has been used and researched to explain the adhesive bond between 
aggregate and asphalt binder and its failure. The use of liquid with a polarity opposite to that of an 
aggregate with unbalanced surface charge and energy leads to the formation of an adhesive bond. 
Water, if present in addition to asphalt binder, could meet the surface energy requirement of an 
aggregate, and hence displace asphalt binder (stripping) as the preferred coating. 
The nature of the aggregate is of primary importance. Generally, siliceous quartz and granite, 
which are also classifed as “acidic type,” have less affnity for asphalt binder (and make it more 
diffcult to provide a bond between the aggregate and the binder) than basic rocks such as basalts 
and limestone. A signifcant increase in the adsorption of asphalt can be caused by the presence of 
a fne microstructure of pores, voids, and microcracks on the aggregate surface. The surface texture 
ISTUDYAsphalt and Emulsions 257 
of the aggregate, viscosity of asphalt during mixing, and polarity of asphalt affect the adhesion 
signifcantly. 
9.14 ASPHALT EMULSIONS 
Asphalt emulsions are used in many applications as they allow the introduction of asphalt at ambient 
temperature, without the need for high temperature, because of the low viscosity (0.5–10 P at 60°C, 
compared to 100–4000 P at 60°C for asphalt). Furthermore, emulsions can be diluted with water for 
various applications, such as dust control and priming, and they are compatible with additives such 
as cement, lime, or latex. 
Emulsions are produced by dispersing asphalt binder as droplets of small diameter with the help 
of an emulsifying agent. The emulsifying agent(s) and other additives, if needed, provide the elec￾trical charges to the droplets of asphalt binder so that they repel each other and remain dispersed 
in water. Common anionic emulsifers, which impart negative charges, are made from the saponi￾fcation of fatty acid-type materials, such as rosins and lignins (wood by-products) with sodium or 
potassium hydroxide. Cationic emulsifers are generally made from fatty amines (such as diamines) 
and hydrochloric acids, as well as from fatty quaternary ammonium salts. 
Emulsifers are surfactants with nonpolar lipophilic and polar hydrophilic portions in the same 
molecule along with a counterion. When applied, the emulsifer concentrates on the interface 
between water and asphalt, and as the counterion diffuses into the water, the asphalt droplets are 
left with a net charge, which also depends on the pH. Cationic emulsifers have ammonium com￾pounds with positively charged N atom, whereas anionic emulsifers contain negatively charged O 
atoms. The presence of “excess” or free emulsifer in the water phase prevents coalescence after 
emulsifcation, during storage and transport, and affects the setting process. Manufacturers select a 
proper emulsion making “recipe” (emulsifer/asphalt/water/stabilizer) to meet specifc demands of 
aggregates (reactivity) and temperature during application. 
The successful use of a specifc emulsion depends on the type of the aggregate with which it is 
used. Depending upon the charge, there are primarily two types of emulsions that are used in pave￾ment mixes—anionic, containing negatively charged droplets of asphalt binder, and cationic, con￾taining positively charged droplets. The emulsifer keeps the emulsion in equilibrium (stabilizes the 
emulsion) and dictates the breaking (coalescing of droplets) rate and adhesion of the asphalt binder 
to the aggregate. Nonionic emulsions (without any charge) can also be produced. 
Emulsions are produced in a colloid mill containing a high-speed (1000–6000 revolutions/min) 
rotor through which hot asphalt binder and emulsifer solutions are passed at specifc temperatures. 
The shearing action of the rotor forms asphalt binder droplets, which get coated with emulsifer 
and, as a result, get charged, which prevents them from coalescing. High-pressure mills are used 
to facilitate the production of emulsion from higher viscosity grade asphalt binders, and static mix￾ers with baffe walls through which the materials can be pumped at a high speed can also be used 
instead of a colloid mill. Generally an emulsion may contain about 28% droplets smaller than 1 μm 
in size, 57% droplets 1–5 μm in size, and the rest 5–10 μm in size. In general, emulsions contain 
50%–75% of asphalt. 
9.14.1 PROPERTIES 
The desirable properties of emulsion include adequate stability, proper viscosity and breaking char￾acteristics, and strong adhesion. The emulsion must be stable during storage, transportation, and 
applications and must be suffciently fuid (but not too fuid to be optimum) to facilitate application. 
The emulsion should break in a timely manner, in contact with the aggregates, and form strong 
bonds. 
Stability of an emulsion refers to the ability to keep the asphalt droplets well dispersed through￾out the emulsion. Because the density of asphalt is slightly higher than the aqueous phase of the 
ISTUDY 
258 Pavement Engineering 
emulsion at ambient temperature, the droplets would tend to settle down over time, form clumps by 
agglomeration, and ultimately form larger globules by coalescing. Allowable ranges of storage tem￾peratures vary from 20°C–60°C (minimum) to 50°C–85°C. Slow and medium setting emulsions as 
well as high foats have a higher range of storage temperature. For storage, small diameter vertical 
storage tanks with adequate protection against freezing should be used. 
The viscosity of emulsion can be increased by increasing the amount of asphalt binder; increas￾ing the viscosity of the continuous phase, such as by increasing the emulsifer content; and decreas￾ing the droplet sizes, such as by increasing the fow rate through the colloid mill or decreasing the 
viscosity of the asphalt binder used for emulsion. Emulsion viscosity is measured with an orifce 
viscometer, in which viscosity is determined from the time required for a specifc amount of emul￾sion to fow through a standard orifce. 
The breaking characteristics of an emulsion can be affected by the asphalt content, composi￾tion of the aqueous phase, droplet size distribution, environmental conditions, type of aggregates, 
and use of breaking agents. The rate of breaking can be increased with an increase in asphalt and 
emulsifer content and by reducing the size of asphalt droplets. Note that the breaking process is 
accelerated by the evaporation of water from the emulsion, as well as by the absorption of the emul￾sifer into the aggregates. High temperatures and low humidity are favorable to breaking, while the 
presence of dust coating on the aggregate surface could accelerate the breaking process without 
causing any adhesion of the asphalt binder to the aggregate surface. The presence of calcium and 
magnesium ions on the aggregate surface would also accelerate the breaking process. If the emulsi￾fer is absorbed from the solution into the aggregates at the desired rate (such as through a rough￾textured porous surface), the lowering of the charge on the droplets causes rapid coalescence and 
good adhesion of the asphalt binder to the aggregate surface. The breaking can also be accelerated 
with the use of breaking agents, sprayed along with the emulsion or just after the application of the 
emulsion, as well as with the help of mechanical compaction (using a roller). 
The adhesive nature of emulsion is made possible by good “wetting” of the aggregate surface 
(high surface tension on the aggregate surface) and the creation of a thermodynamically stable 
system of minimum surface energy. There are many factors that affect this process, including the 
aggregate type (such as acidic or basic), type and amount of emulsifer (such as cationic or anionic), 
grade of the asphalt, and size of the droplets. 
It is important to note that although the viscosity of the asphalt binder has no effect on the viscos￾ity of an emulsion formed with it, there are several properties of the asphalt binder that do affect the 
emulsion properties signifcantly. These include its electrolyte content, which can cause an increase 
as well as a decrease in viscosity depending on its amount, density (a higher density causes lower 
stability), and acid content (depending on the type of the emulsion, it may improve or deteriorate 
stability). 
Emulsions are also made with polymer-modifed binders (polymer is generally added to reduce 
temperature susceptibility) that generally require higher temperatures for manufacturing. However, 
one benefcial effect of polymer is the ability to use a higher asphalt content in the emulsion without 
affecting its viscosity (and hence ease of use) adversely. 
9.14.2 TESTS FOR ASPHALT EMULSIONS 
Particle charge test: In this test, a current is sent through an anode and cathode immersed in an 
emulsion. If the cathode shows an appreciable layer of asphalt binder at the end of the test, then the 
emulsion is characterized as cationic. 
Viscosity test: The Saybolt Furol viscosity test is conducted to measure viscosity, either at 25°C 
or 50°C. 
Demulsibility test: This test is conducted to check the rate of breaking of rapid-setting emulsions 
when applied on aggregates or soils. The test consists of mixing an emulsion with a solution of water 
and either calcium chloride or dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (for anionic and cationic emulsions, 
ISTUDYAsphalt and Emulsions 259 
respectively) and sieving the mix. The concentration of the solution and the minimum amount of 
asphalt retained on the sieve (as a result of coalescence) are generally specifed. A similar test is 
conducted for the SS grades using fnely ground Portland cement and washing over a 1.40 mm sieve. 
Generally, limits are specifed on the amount of material that is retained on the sieve to ensure the 
ability of the emulsion to mix with the soil/aggregate with high surface area before breaking. 
Identifcation test for CRS (ASTM D 244): In this test, sand washed with hydrochloric acid and 
alcohol is mixed with emulsion for 2 min, and then the uncoated area is compared to the coated 
area. 
Identifcation test for CSS (ASTM D 244): In this test, washed and dried silica sand is mixed with 
the emulsion until they are completely coated, and the mix is cured for 24 h and then placed for 10 
min in a beaker with boiling water. Then the sample is spread on a level surface and the part of the 
mix coated, as percentage of the mix, is determined. 
Settlement and storage stability tests: In this test, a specifed volume of emulsion is made to 
stand in a graduated cylinder for either 24 h (for the storage test) or 5 days (for the settlement test), 
and then samples are taken from the top and bottom of the cylinder, weighed, and heated to evapo￾rate the water. The difference in weight of the residue from the top and the bottom parts, if any, is 
determined. 
Sieve test: In this test, an emulsion is poured over a 850 μm sieve, and the sieve is rinsed with 
mild sodium oleate solution and distilled water for anionic emulsions and distilled water only for 
cationic emulsions. Then the sieve and retained asphalt binder are dried and weighed, and the 
amount of asphalt binder that is retained on the sieve is determined. 
Coating ability and water resistance test: This test is conducted for MS emulsions to check their 
ability to coat aggregates, remain as a flm during mixing, and resist washing action of water after 
mixing. The test consists of two steps. In the frst step, the aggregate is coated with calcium carbon￾ate dust and then mixed with emulsion. Half of the mix is placed on an absorbent paper for visual 
inspection of coating. The rest is sprayed with water and rinsed until the water runs clear and then 
placed on the absorbent paper for inspection of coating. In the second step, the frst step is repeated, 
but the emulsion is added to the aggregate only after coating the aggregates with water. 
Field coating test: In this test, measured amounts of aggregate and emulsion are mixed with the 
hands, and the coating is observed during the 5 min mixing process. Then the coated aggregates 
are placed in a container, which is flled with water, and the water is drained off fve times (after 
reflling). Next the aggregates are checked for coating. A good coating indicates a full coating of 
aggregate; a fair coating indicates an excess of coated over uncoated area; a poor coating indicates 
an excess of uncoated over coated area. 
Unit weight test: The weight of an asphalt emulsion in a standard measure of a known volume is 
found out to determine its unit weight. 
Residue and oil distillate by distillation: The asphalt, oil, and water can be separated in an emul￾sion for subsequent testing by distillation, which consists of heating the emulsion in an aluminum 
alloy still at a temperature of 260°C for 15 min. 
Residue by evaporation: Residue from the emulsion can also be obtained by evaporating it in 
an oven at 163°C. This test should not be run if the residue needs to be tested for the foat test. The 
residue can be tested for specifc gravity (ASTM D 70, AASHTO T 228). 
Solubility in trichloroethylene (ASTM D 2042, AASHTO T 44): In this test, the residue is dis￾solved in a solvent, and the insoluble (contaminants) part is separated by fltration. 
Penetration test (ASTM D 5, AASHTO T 49), ductility test (ASTM D 113, AASHTO T 51), and 
ring and ball softening point test (ASTM D 36, AASHTO T 53): Similar to that described for asphalt 
binders. 
Float test (ASTM D 139, AASHTO T 50): This test, conducted to determine resistance to fow at 
high temperatures, consists of forming a test plug of residue asphalt (from emulsion) in a brass collar 
and screwing the collar at the bottom of an aluminum foat placed in a 60°C water bath. The time 
required by the water to break through the plug is determined, and a higher time indicates a higher 
ISTUDY 
260 Pavement Engineering 
resistance. Asphalt emulsions showing high foat test numbers (called high foats) possess a gel-like 
structure and are resistant to fow from high temperatures during the summer. 
Breaking index: In this test, which is run for rapid-setting (RS) emulsion, silica sand is added 
and mixed with the emulsion under controlled conditions of rate and temperature. Breaking index 
is defned as the weight of the sand needed in grams to break the emulsion. 
Vialit test: This test simulates the formation of chip seal—aggregate embedded by rolling onto 
an emulsion-coated surface—in a small metal plate. After curing, the aggregates are treated with 
water and dried. Finally, a 500 g steel ball is dropped from a specifed height three times on the 
reverse side of the plate, and the weight loss of the aggregate is measured. 
Zeta potential: In this test, the speed of movement of asphalt binder droplets in an aqueous 
medium is measured to determine the intensity of charge. 
Elastic recovery after ductility: This test follows the ductility test and involves determining the 
percentage recovery of the thread that has been used in the ductility test, when cut into half. 
Force ductility: The test is similar to the ductility test, but the force required to cause the elonga￾tion of the asphalt thread is measured. 
Tensile strength test: In this test, the force (stress) required to pull an asphalt thread in the verti￾cal direction to a specifed elongation (strain) is determined. 
Torsional recovery: In this test, a shaft and arm assembly are immersed in a heated sample of 
the residue asphalt and are twisted 180° inside the sample at a lower temperature. The percentage 
recovery after a specifed time is then determined. 
9.14.3 CLASSIFICATION OF EMULSIONS AND SELECTION 
Emulsions are classifed according to their charge (cationic [C] and anionic [no symbol]), as men￾tioned earlier. They are also classifed according to their rate of breaking or setting—rapid (rapid 
setting, or RS), quick (QS), medium (MS), or slow (SS). A number is used for denoting the relative 
viscosity of the emulsion. Hence, CRS-1 means a cationic RS emulsion with less viscosity than an 
MS-2 emulsion, which is anionic and medium setting. A h or an s following the emulsion name 
would indicate the use of hard and soft asphalt binder, respectively, whereas HF indicates “high 
foat” properties as measured in the foat test. 
The separation of water from the emulsion is called breaking, the coalescing of asphalt binder 
droplets is called setting, and the formation of a continuous adhesive layer of asphalt binder (through 
breaking) on the surface of the aggregates is called curing. Breaking is generally accompanied by 
the formation of black and sticky material from the more fuid and brownish emulsion. Too early 
coalescence of asphalt droplets can lead to the formation of “skin” that can prevent the evaporation 
of water that is also needed for the curing phase. Such a situation can arise in the case of an emulsion 
with smaller asphalt droplets with narrow size distribution. 
Emulsions are graded according to their rate of breaking (SS, MS, QS, and RS), the nature of 
their charge (cationic [C] and anionic [no symbol]), the presence of hard and soft asphalt (H or S), 
and the results of the foat test (HF if high results). The following are the ASTM and AASHTO 
specifed grades of emulsion.

ASTM D 2397, AASHTO M 208: CRS-1, CRS-2, CMS-2, CMS-2h, CSS-1, CSS-1h 
Generally, rapid setting emulsions are used for aggregates with low surface area (low reactivity) 
such as those for chip seals, whereas as slow setting emulsions are used for gradations with suf￾fcient surface area, such as for cold dense mixes. In the case of tack coat, a slow setting emulsion 
or medium setting emulsion is used after diluting with water. For stability and to prevent bleeding, 
rapid setting emulsions are not used in this case; however, because of low application rate (0.1 g/ 
square yard) and a resulting thin layer, it breaks quickly.

Distress and Performance 10
A brand new pavement at the start of its design life is expected to be one without any “distress” 
or undesirable features. Such features, which include rutting, cracking, patching, or roughness, 
are “undesirable” from the point of view of performance of the pavement—the more distress, the 
shorter the pavement’s life—and at some point, the distresses are so great in intensity (e.g., deep 
ruts) as well as extent (e.g., 75% of the wheel path area in a project area has cracks) that the pavement 
is considered to be “failed” or at the end of its design life. 
The following sections explain the possible distresses and their relationship to the performance 
of a pavement. 
10.1 DISTRESSES IN ASPHALT PAVEMENTS 
There are different forms of distresses in asphalt pavements, each tied to a specifc reason (such as 
poor mix design, construction, or environmental conditions) or a combination thereof, and most 
happening as a result of traffc. Figure 10.1 lists the common distresses in asphalt pavements. The 
different distresses are described in the following sections, in alphabetical order (FHWA, 2003). 
10.1.1 BLEEDING 
Bleeding is the appearance of asphalt binder on the surface of the pavement. This is a surface defect 
caused by excessive asphalt binder in the surface asphalt mix layer. It is measured in square meters. 
The different conditions of bleeding include discoloration, covering of aggregate with a thin refec￾tive surface, and loss of texture. 
10.1.2 BLOCK CRACKING 
Block cracking refers to a pattern of cracks that divide the surface into approximately rectangular 
pieces (> 0.1 m2
). Such cracks occur due to thixotropic hardening of the asphalt binder, mostly due 
to higher air voids, such as in areas with low traffc. It is measured in square meters, and its severity 
can be described as low (crack width ≤ 6 mm or sealed cracks whose width cannot be measured, 
with sealant in good condition), moderate (crack width > 6 mm but ≤ 19 mm or any crack with mean 
width ≤ 19 mm and adjacent low-severity random cracking), and high (crack width > 19 mm or any 
crack with mean width ≤ 19 mm and adjacent moderate to high severity random cracking). 
10.1.3 CORRUGATIONS 
Corrugations are ripples formed laterally across an asphalt pavement surface. These occur as a 
result of lack of stability of the hot mix asphalt (HMA) at a location where traffc starts and stops or 
on hills where vehicles brake downgrade. The causes of the lack of stability are too much or too soft 
asphalt, a high sand content, and an excessive presence of smooth and rounded aggregate in the mix. 
10.1.4 DELAMINATION 
Delamination is the separation of the top wearing layer from the layer underneath. It is caused by 
poor bond or by failure of the bond between the two layers. The poor bond can be due to improper 
surface preparation or tack coat before the application of the wearing layer and/or a relatively thin

wearing layer. The loss of bond can be caused by environmental factors such as ingress of water and 
repeated freeze-thaw cycles. 
10.1.5 EDGE CRACKS 
Edge cracks are found in pavements with unpaved shoulders. They are crescent shaped or fairly 
continuous cracks that intersect the pavement edge. The cracks are located within 0.6 m of the pave￾ment edge adjacent to the shoulder. Longitudinal cracks outside of the wheel path and within 0.6 m 
of the pavement edge are also classifed as edge cracks. 
The cracking is due to the lack of lateral (shoulder) support, base, or subgrade weakness 
caused by frost action and inadequate drainage. It is measured in meters, and severity is reported 
as low (cracks without breakup or loss of material), moderate (loss of material and breakup in 
up to 10% of the cracked area), or high (loss of material or breakup in more than 10% of the 
cracked area). 
10.1.6 FATIGUE CRACKS AND EDGE FATIGUE CRACKS 
Fatigue cracks generally begin at the wheel path. Edge fatigue cracks are formed due to poor under￾lying support at the edge of the pavements with paved shoulders. This distress, found on wheel 
paths, begins as a series of interconnected cracks and develops into a chicken wire/alligator pattern. 
Interconnected cracks give rise to many-sided, sharp-angle pieces, usually with a maximum length 
of 0.3 m. Repeated tensile stress/strain at the bottom of the asphalt mix layer, caused by traffc, leads 
to fatigue cracking. It starts from the bottom and moves upward. The cracked area must be quantif￾able in order to be counted as a fatigue crack. The cracked area should be measured in square meters 
for each of the three severity levels: low, medium, and severe. If, within an area, there are differ￾ent severity levels and they cannot be distinguished, the entire area should be rated for the highest 
severity rating. A low-severity area is one in which there are no or few connecting cracks, the cracks 
are not spalled or sealed, and there is no evidence of pumping. Moderate-severity areas are those in 
which the cracks are interconnected, forming a complete pattern, and cracks may be slightly spalled 
or sealed, with no evidence of pumping. In a high-severity area, the cracks are interconnected with 
moderate or severe spalls, forming a complete pattern; pieces may move under traffc; cracks may 
be sealed; and pumping may be evident. 
10.1.7 LONGITUDINAL JOINT CRACKS 
Longitudinal joint cracks develop at construction joints because of poorly paved joints or improper 
construction techniques. They are measured in meters, and their severity is expressed in the same 
manner as in block cracking. 
10.1.8 POLISHED AGGREGATE 
Polished aggregate is the exposure of coarse aggregate due to wearing away of the asphalt binder 
and fne aggregates from the surface asphalt mix. It is measured in square meters. 
10.1.9 POTHOLES 
Bowl-shaped holes, with a minimum plan dimension of 150 mm in the pavement surface, are called 
potholes. There are four main causes of potholes: (1) insuffcient thickness of the pavement to sup￾port traffc through winter-spring freeze-thaw cycles; (2) poor drainage, leading to accumulation of 
excess water; (3) failures at utility trenches and castings; and (4) paving defects and unsealed cracks. 
For a distress survey, the number of potholes and the square meters of affected area are recorded. 
ISTUDY268 Pavement Engineering 
Severity levels can be reported as low (< 25 mm deep), moderate (25 mm < depth < 50 mm), or high 
(> 50 mm deep). 
10.1.10 RAVELING 
Raveling refers to wearing away of the pavement surface by loss of asphalt binder and displacement 
of aggregates. The process starts as loss of fnes and can continue to a situation with loss of coarse 
aggregate and a very rough and pitted surface. Raveling is caused by the action of water that fnds 
its way through the surface of the pavement because of poor compaction and hence low density and 
relatively high voids, and it can initiate the potholing process. It is measured in square meters. 
10.1.11 REFLECTIVE CRACKING 
Refective cracks are those in asphalt overlays caused by discontinuities in the pavement structure 
underneath. This can be due to old, cracked asphalt pavement or joints in concrete pavement under￾neath. The severity levels are recorded in the same manner as in block cracking. 
10.1.12 RUTTING 
A rut is defned as a longitudinal depression in the wheel path with or without transverse displace￾ment. It can be measured with a straight edge or a profler at regular intervals. A rut is a physical 
distortion of the surface, and it also prevents the cross drainage of water during rains, which leads 
to the accumulation of water in the ruts and an increase in the potential of hydroplaning-related 
accidents. Generally a rut depth of 0.5 in. is considered a rutting failure. Rutting is the result of 
repeated loading, which causes accumulation, and increase of permanent deformations. Rutting can 
be (1) low to moderate severity rutting—one-dimensional densifcation or vertical compression near 
the center of the wheel path caused by densifcation of mixes with excessive air voids in the in-place 
mix under traffc; (2) moderate to high severity rutting—a depression in the wheel path along with 
humps on either side of the depression caused by the lateral fow due to plastic deformation and 
resulting from shear failure of the mix under traffc, and it is generally associated with very low air 
voids in the mix; and (3) rutting accompanied by cracks on the surface of the pavement caused by 
rutting in underlying layers, such as the subgrade or subbase. 
10.1.13 SLIPPAGE CRACK 
Slippage cracks are typically crescent or half moon shaped cracks produced when vehicles brake or 
turn, which causes the pavement surface to slide or push. This is caused by a low-strength HMA or 
a lack of bond between the surface and lower courses. 
10.1.14 THERMAL CRACKS 
Thermal cracking occurs in the form of transverse cracking, which is defned as cracks that are 
predominantly perpendicular to the pavement centerline. These cracks occur at regular intervals. 
Thermal cracks can be caused by the fracture of asphalt mix due to a severe drop in temperature 
or by thermal fatigue caused by repeated low and high temperature cycles. The severity of thermal 
cracking is measured by the width of the crack. A low-severity transverse crack is one with a mean 
width of ≤ 6 mm or a sealed crack with sealant material in good condition and a width that cannot 
be determined. A medium-severity transverse crack is one with a mean width > 6 and ≤ 19 mm or 
any crack with a mean width ≤ 19 mm and adjacent low-severity random cracking; a high-severity 
crack has a mean width > 19 mm or ≤ 19 mm but with adjacent moderate to high severity random 
cracking. Only cracks that are > 0.3 m in length are counted. The number and length of transverse 
ISTUDYDistress and Performance 269
cracks at each severity level are recorded. The entire transverse crack is to be rated at the highest 
severity level that is present for at least 10% of the total length of the crack. The length, in m, is the 
total length of the crack. If the cracks are sealed, then the length of cracks with sealant in good con￾dition (for at least 90% of the crack) should be measured at each severity level. Part of the thermal 
transverse crack extending into a load-induced fatigue crack area is not counted.
10.2 DISTRESSES IN CONCRETE PAVEMENTS
The different types of distresses found in PCC pavements are described next. Figure 10.2 summa￾rizes the different distresses.
10.2.1 Corner Breaks
A corner portion of the slab is separated by a crack. The crack intersects the adjacent transverse 
and longitudinal joints and is approximately at a 45° angle with the direction of traffic. The length

270 Pavement Engineering 
of the sides is from 0.3 m to one-half the width of the slab on each side of the corner. Corner breaks 
are measured by counting the number that is encountered per unit length. For a low-severity level, 
the crack is not spalled more than 10% of the length of the crack, and there is no faulting. For a 
moderate-severity level, the crack is spalled > 10% of its total length or the faulting of the crack or 
joint is < 13 mm and the corner piece is not broken into two or more pieces. For a high-severity level, 
the crack is spalled at moderate to high severity > 10% of its total length, the faulting of the crack 
or joint is ≥ 13 mm or the corner piece is broken into two or more pieces or contains patch material. 
10.2.2 DURABILITY CRACKING (OR “D” CRACKING) 
In this type of distress, the cracking is due to freezing and thawing and usually initiates at construc￾tion joints. These are usually closely spaced crescent-shaped hairline cracks that appear like the 
letter D. D-cracks are measured by recording the number of slabs with “D” cracking and the square 
meters of area affected at each severity level. The slab and affected area severity rating is based 
on the highest severity level present for at least 10% of the area affected. For low-severity distress, 
D-cracks are close together, with no loose or missing concrete pieces, and no patches in the affected 
area. For moderate severity, D-cracks are well defned, and some small concrete pieces are loose or 
have been displaced. For high severity, D-cracking has a well-developed pattern, with a signifcant 
amount of loose or missing material, and may have been patched. 
10.2.3 LONGITUDINAL CRACKING 
These are stress cracks that are predominantly parallel to the pavement centerline and are measured in 
meters. For low-severity distress, crack widths are < 3 mm in width, with no spalling and no measur￾able faulting, or are well sealed and with a width that cannot be determined. For moderate-severity 
distress, crack widths range between 3 and 13 mm, with spalling < 75 mm, or faulting up to 13 mm. 
For high-severity distress, crack widths are < 13 mm, with spalling < 75 mm, or faulting < 13 mm. 
10.2.4 TRANSVERSE CRACKING 
These are stress cracks that are predominantly perpendicular to the pavement centerline and are 
measured in meters. For low-severity distress, crack widths are < 3 mm, with no spalling and no 
measurable faulting, or are well sealed similar to longitudinal cracking. For moderate-severity dis￾tress, crack widths are > 3 and < 6 mm, with spalling < 75 mm, or faulting up to 6 mm. For high￾severity distress, crack widths are > 6 mm, with spalling > 75 mm, or faulting > 6 mm. 
10.2.5 SPALLING OF TRANSVERSE JOINTS 
This distress consists of cracking, breaking, chipping, or fraying of slab edges within 0.3 m from the 
face of the transverse joint and is measured in frequency of occurrence and meters. For low-severity 
distress, spalls are < 75 mm wide, measured to the face of the joint, with loss of material, or spalls 
with no loss of material and no patching. For medium-severity distress, spalls are 75–150 mm wide, 
measured to the face of the joint, with loss of material. For high-severity distress, spalls are > 150 
mm wide, measured to the face of the joint, with loss of material, or broken into two or more pieces 
or contain patch material. 
10.2.6 MAP CRACKING AND SCALING 
Map cracking is a series of interconnected cracks that extend into the upper surface of the slab. Usually, 
larger cracks are oriented in the longitudinal direction of the slab and are interconnected by fner 
transverse or random cracks. These are measured in frequency of occurrence and in square meters. 
ISTUDYDistress and Performance 271 
 
 
Scaling is the deterioration and faking of the upper concrete slab surface, normally in areas of 
3–13 mm, and may occur anywhere over the pavement. This is measured by the number of occur￾rences and the square meters of affected area. 
10.2.7 POLISHED AGGREGATE 
Exposed and polished coarse aggregate occur due to surface mortar and paste loss, which results in 
a signifcant reduction of surface friction. Distress is measured in square meters of affected surface 
area. The level of severity is not applicable for this distress. Diamond grinding also removes surface 
texturing, but this condition should not be recorded as polished aggregate. 
10.2.8 POPOUTS 
Popouts are small pieces of pavement broken loose from the surface, ranging in diameter from 25 
to 100 mm and ranging in depth from 13 to 50 mm. 
10.2.9 BLOWUPS 
Blowups are slab length changes resulting in localized upward movement of the pavement surface 
at transverse joints or face cracks and are usually accompanied by shattering of the concrete in that 
area. Distress is measured by recording the number of blowups. Severity levels are not applicable. 
However, severity levels can be defned by the relative effect of a blowup on ride quality and safety. 
10.2.10 FAULTING OF TRANSVERSE JOINTS AND CRACKS 
This occurs as a result of an elevation difference across a joint or crack. Distress is measured in 
millimeters to the nearest millimeter at a location 0.3 and 0.75 m from the outside slab edge (this is 
approximately the location of the outer wheel path). For a widened lane, the wheel path location will 
be 0.75 m from the outside lane edge stripe. Faulting is recorded as positive (+) if the “approach” 
slab is higher than the “departure” slab; if the approach slab is lower, faulting is recorded as nega￾tive (−). Faulting on PCC pavements can be measured using a Federal Highway Administration 
(FHWA)-modifed Georgia faultmeter. 
10.2.11 LANE-TO-SHOULDER DROP-OFF 
This is a difference in elevation between the edge of the slab and the outside shoulder and usually 
occurs when the outside shoulder settles. Distress is measured at the longitudinal construction joint 
between the lane edge and shoulder. Distress is recorded to the nearest millimeter at 15–25 m inter￾vals. The recorded value is negative (−) if the traveled surface is lower than the shoulder. 
10.2.12 LANE-TO-SHOULDER SEPARATION 
This is a widening of the joint between the edge of the slab and the shoulder. Distress is measured 
to the nearest millimeter at intervals of 15–25 m along the lane-to-shoulder joint. It should be docu￾mented if the joint is well sealed or not at each shoulder location. Severity levels are not applicable. 
10.2.13 PATCH/PATCH DETERIORATION 
A patch is a portion greater than 0.1 m2, all of the original concrete slab that has been removed and 
replaced, or additional material applied to the pavement after original construction. For a low-severity 
level distress, the patch displays low-severity distress of any type, there is no measurable faulting 
ISTUDY 
272 Pavement Engineering 
or settlement, and pumping is not evident. For a moderate-severity level, the patch has moderate￾severity distress of any type or faulting or settlement up to 6 mm, and pumping is not evident. For 
a high-severity level, the patch has a high-severity distress of any type, or faulting or settlement 
>6 mm, and pumping may be evident. 
10.2.14 WATER BLEEDING AND PUMPING 
This is the ejection or seepage of water from beneath the pavement through cracks. The residue of 
very fne materials deposited on the surface that were eroded (or pumped) from the support layers, 
causing staining, aids in recognizing pumping phenomenon. This is measured by recording the 
number of occurrences of water bleeding and pumping and the length in meters of affected pave￾ment with a minimum length of 1 m. The combined length of water bleeding and pumping cannot 
exceed the length of the test section. 
10.2.15 PUNCHOUTS 
Punchouts are broken areas enclosed by two closely spaced (commonly < 0.6 m) transverse 
cracks, a short longitudinal crack, and the edge of the pavement or a longitudinal joint. They 
also include “Y” cracks that exhibit spalling, breakup, or faulting. The number of punchouts 
should be recorded at each severity level. It should be noted that the cracks that outline the 
punchout are also recorded under “longitudinal cracking” and “transverse cracking.” Punchouts 
that have been completely repaired by removing all broken pieces and replacing them with 
patching material (rigid or fexible) are rated as patches. For low-severity distress, transverse 
cracks are tight and may have spalling < 75 mm or faulting < 6 mm, with no loss of material 
and no patching. For moderate distress, spalling > 75 mm and < 150 mm or faulting > 6 mm 
and < 13 mm exists. For a high-severity rating, spalling is > 150 mm, or concrete within the 
punchout is punched down by > 13 mm, is loose and moves under traffc, is broken into two or 
more pieces, or contains patch material. 
10.2.16 JOINT SEAL DAMAGE 
Joint seal damage is any condition that enables incompressible materials or a signifcant amount 
of water to infltrate the joint from the surface. Common types of joint seal damage are extrusion, 
hardening, adhesive failure (bonding), cohesive failure (splitting), complete loss of sealant, and the 
intrusion of foreign material in the joint such as weed growth in the joint. This distress is measured 
by recording the number of longitudinal joints that are sealed and the length of sealed longitudinal 
joints with joint seal. The severity level is not applicable. 
10.3 CONSIDERATION OF PERFORMANCE 
A pavement is constructed for the safe and smooth passage of traffc. There is a need to quantify 
the extent to which the pavement is serving its purpose or its “performance.” Such quantifcation 
can be done with respect to distress conditions exhibited by the pavement at any time after its 
construction. 
The AASHO Road Test introduced the concept of serviceability to measure performance. 
It was necessary to characterize the pavement sections in terms of their condition, in order to 
develop relationships between the performance and the factors affecting the performance. First, 
the concept of present serviceability rating (PSR) was introduced. PSR (Figure 10.3) is defned as 
the judgment of an observer as to the current ability of a pavement to serve the traffc it is meant 
to serve.

FIGURE 10.3 Concept of present serviceability rating. 
The PSR ranges from 1 to 5, starting from a perfect 5 and decreasing with the passage of traffc. 
To characterize pavements in terms of the serviceability rating, the pavement serviceability index 
(PSI) was then introduced on the basis of observed distress conditions: 
PSI ˜ . ° . log 1˛SV °1 38RD2 5 03 1 91 ˝ ˙ . ° 0 0. 1 C ˛ P (flexible pavement) 10.1 
PSI ˜ 5 4. 1 1° .80 log˝1˛ SV˙ ° 0 09. C ˛ P(rigid pavement) 10.2
where 
SV is the mean of the slope variance in the two wheel paths (measured with the CHLOE proflom￾eter or Bureau of Public Roads [BPR] roughometer) 
C, P are the measures of cracking and patching in the pavement surface 
C is the total linear feet of Class 3 and Class 4 cracks per 1000 ft2 of pavement area 
A Class 3 crack is defned as opened or spalled (at the surface) to a width of 0.25 in. or more over a 
distance equal to at least one-half the crack length. A Class 4 crack is defned as any crack that has 
been sealed. RD is the average rut depth (in.). P is expressed in terms of ft2 per 1000 ft2 of pavement 
surfacing. The basic idea was that just like PSR (numerically the same value as PSI), PSI would drop 
over time (i.e., with the passage of traffc), starting from an initial p0 to a terminal pt
. The curve can 
be expressed with an equation as follows (Figure 10.4):

where 
po = initial PCI 
pt

p = PCI at any time 
W is the cumulative load 
β and ρ are regression coeffcients 
Note that performance at any time can be expressed as the area under the serviceability curve from 
the beginning to the point under consideration. The serviceability of the pavement at any time can 
be “raised” by rehabilitation, such as an asphalt mix overlay.

10.4 DAMAGE 
In the AASHTO design process, the loss of serviceability (ΔPSI) is referred to as damage. This dam￾age is considered to be caused by traffc, environmental conditions, and age. In mechanistic-empiri￾cal pavement design processes, the performance of the pavement is expressed in terms of distresses. 
The distresses are predicted on the basis of models (commonly referred to as transfer functions) 
relating mechanistic response (stress/strain) to observed distress. Note that such models need to be 
calibrated for specifc regions, climate, materials, and construction conditions. In more sophisticated 
methods, a damage index is calculated from a mechanistic response, and the damage index is used to 
compute accumulation of distress with time. Damage is defned as the deterioration of the pavement 
due to the action of traffc over different environmental conditions. Such deterioration happens as a 
result of change in the engineering properties of the pavement layer materials. 
This damage does not happen altogether at the same time, but rather progressively—or, more pre￾cisely, in increments—with the passage of every vehicle or, if expressed in time, every hour during 
its service. Note that the damage at every hour is not the same—it can be higher, for example, due to 
a heavier vehicle moving over it at that hour or due to a lowering of the modulus of the asphalt mix 
layer due to a high temperature that hour. Therefore, the most rational approach is to consider and 
compute the damage in each and every increment by considering the relevant traffc (class of vehicle) 
and the pavement material properties (with respect to environmental conditions such as temperature) 
for that increment period (say, 1 h). The damage at any increment can be expressed as follows: 
n D = 10.4 
N
where 
n is the actual load applications 
N is the allowable number of load applications 
Note that the allowable number of loads is dependent on the condition of the pavement layer at any 
increment period—hence, N is different for different increment periods 
The total damage at any point is computed by summing up all of the damages over time, up to that 
time, as follows (commonly referred to as Miner’s hypothesis; Miner, 1945): 
n m o n
Total damage ˜ ° ° ° ijk 10.5 i l ˜ j l ˜ k l ˜ Nijk
where i, j, and k are the different categories over which the summation of the damage is made. 
ISTUDYDistress and Performance 275 
 
 
 
Such categories can include different time increments, traffc wander, and truck class. The basic 
idea is that for each and every time increment (i.e., for a unique set of material properties tied to 
a unique set of environmental conditions), the damage is determined for each and every type and 
movement of the vehicle. The more categories used in the calculation of increments, the more pre￾cise is the damage calculation. 
This total damage over time can then be related to distress, and then fnally the distress can be 
expressed as a function of time. For any specifc type of distress, when total damage (sometimes 
referred to as the cumulative damage factor or CDF) reaches 1, the pavement is said to have failed 
(say, by cracking). 
In a simpler approach, instead of considering the damage in each and every increment individu￾ally, effective or weighted values of each variable could be used to determine the total damage. For 
example, the concept of effective soil (roadbed/subgrade) resilient modulus is recommended in the 
AASHTO design procedure. The method consists of the laboratory or in-place determination (or 
prediction through the correlation of other properties) of resilient modulus of the soil for different 
moisture conditions (wet dry) that are expected in the different moisture seasons. Then an effective 
resilient modulus value is calculated that has the same (equivalent) effect as the combined effect of 
the different moduli under different moisture conditions. This effective modulus is calculated on the 
basis of relative damage due to variation of the soil modulus in different seasons. The procedure is 
illustrated with an example in Figure 10.5. 
10.5 FORENSIC INVESTIGATION FOR DETERMINATION 
OF TYPE AND CAUSE OF DISTRESS 
Forensic investigation to determine the cause of a specifc distress is very important in order to 
determine an effective rehabilitation plan. Because no two pavement sections are alike and the same 
distress can be due to a number of (or a combination of) problems, an appropriate forensic investiga￾tion plan must be made and implemented in each case. Prior to the development of the investigation 
plan, a copy of the report of distress, compilation of existing data, and as assessment of missing data 
need to be made available. A decision depending on the beneft of the forensic investigation, approx￾imate cost, and the assurance of the highway agency to cooperate with the forensic investigation has 
to be made by the forensic team, and preferably the deliberations be noted down for future reference. 
10.5.1 FORENSIC INVESTIGATION PLAN 
Based on a preliminary site inspection, a forensic investigation plan needs to be developed—the 
plan should aim at two things: (1) to determine the mechanism(s) and the cause(s) of the distress, and 
(2) to obtain the desired data, as well as missing and questionable data. The different activities that 
could be utilized for the investigation of different distress are summarized in Table 10.1. The plan 
for obtaining the missing data should include specifc tests that need to be conducted and samples 
that need to be retrieved to accomplish the testing. As far as it is possible, a testing and sampling 
plan should be based on existing standard protocols. A project manual with specifc data collection 
sheets should be developed. The investigation should also include sampling and testing of materials 
from good performing areas of the same pavement to determine and confrm the absence of factors 
that contributed to distress. The different steps in a forensic investigation as outlined by different 
researchers/organizations are shown in Table 10.2. 
10.5.2 NONDESTRUCTIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE TESTS 
For site evaluations, important considerations are topography, geology, drainage pattern, traffc vol￾ume and composition, history of construction and maintenance, and effectiveness of maintenance 
work. Defection testing, such as those with the falling weight defectometer (FWD), is commonly

used as a nondestructive test, although a ground-penetrating radar (GPR), spectral analysis of sur￾face waves (SASW) equipment, as well as a proflometer could be used. The location of the water 
table should be ascertained, and drainage conditions need to be evaluated. 
Coring and trenching are the two commonly used destructive sampling/evaluation methods. 
While coring allows visual evaluation and subsequent laboratory testing, trenching allows the 
investigators to determine exact location of failures (such as rutting), actual thickness of layers, 
presence of moisture in layers, if any, and bond between different layers. 
For soil and aggregate layers, the dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) test could be conducted,

One suggested method of determination of cause(s) of failure is to match the matrix of results 
of feld and laboratory evaluation against the different failure hypotheses and determine which one 
is the most satisfed. Based on the cause of failure, several alternatives for rehabilitation should 
be examined, and the best option should be selected with consideration of economics, design, and 
construction.

Consideration of Major 11 Distress Mechanisms and 
Material Characterization 
for Asphalt Pavements 
11.1 FATIGUE CRACKING 
Different types of distresses have been presented in Chapter 10. The major distresses are consid￾ered in the mix and structural design of asphalt mixes. This consideration consists of three basic 
parts: (1) explaining and formulating the problem, (2) conducting appropriate tests to determine the 
relevant material properties (characterization), and (3) using models to relate the amount/extent of 
distress to the relevant material properties and predict the distress. These three parts are presented 
in the following sections. 
The mechanism of fatigue cracking can be divided into two parts: (1) the occurrence of tensile 
stress/tensile strain in the asphalt mix layer, and (2) the repetitive occurrence of such tensile stress/ 
strain under traffc repetitions. The occurrence of tensile stress/strain results from the elastic behav￾ior of the pavement structure under traffc loading, whereas the initiation and formation of cracks 
result from “fatigue” behavior of the layer. The high tensile stresses/strains responsible for causing 
fatigue cracks can occur because of a relatively thin or weak asphalt mix layer, a very high load 
or tire pressure, or a relatively weak subgrade and/or base and/or subbase due to moisture or low 
density due to inadequate compaction. 
If a beam is subjected to loading from above, then directly under the load the beam would tend 
to assume a convex shape with compressive stresses/strains on the top part and tensile stress/strain 
in the bottom part. Due to the elastic nature of the pavement, in such a situation, it springs back to 
its original position, without the stresses/strains, when the load is removed. However, under the next 
load, it undergoes the same cycle. Under the heaviest possible load, if the pavement structure is such 
that the tensile stress/strain (which is responsible for causing cracks) is very small, then the pavement 
can sustain many such cycles/repetitions without any damage. If the tensile stress/strain is moderate, 
then it can sustain a certain number of repetitions without damage, and if the tensile stress/strain is 
very high, then it can sustain a relatively small number of repetitions before permanent damage. 
There are two analysis steps that are necessary to predict how many repetitions the pavement 
can sustain before it gets damaged. Assuming a standard (high load), one can determine the tensile 
stress/strain at the bottom of the asphalt mix layer of an assumed pavement structure (if there is 
tensile stress/strain in the layer, then it is the maximum at the bottom), using layered elastic analysis, 
as explained in Chapter 3. Then, conducting an experiment to determine how many repetitions the 
pavement can sustain before there is damage, one can determine how many repetitions it can sustain 
for this specifc tensile stress/strain. Now let us get into the details of these steps. 
If one assumes a pavement structure, the elastic moduli, thickness, and Poisson’s ratio of the 
different layers are needed to determine the tensile stress/strain under a specifc load. These prop￾erties can be used from experience. The load can be considered as the highest allowable load— 
say, 9000 lb—by considering a maximum allowable load of 18,000 lb per axle. The Poisson’s 
ratio of the generally used asphalt pavement materials does not differ greatly, and a value of 
0.35–0.4 can be assumed. 
ISTUDY 
280 Pavement Engineering 
Now if the pavement structure is such that the asphalt mix layer on the top is very thin, one may 
determine that there is no tensile stress/strain in the layer, and all through its depth there is only com￾pressive stress/strain. In that case, there is no potential of forming fatigue cracks, as explained here. 
There can be situations between two extremes: (1) the asphalt mix layer is such that it shows a very 
high level of tensile stress/strain at the bottom, and (2) the asphalt mix layer and the pavement struc￾ture are such that there is a very small amount of tensile stress/strain at the bottom. Note that whether 
or not there will be a high tensile stress/strain is dictated by the thickness and stiffness of the asphalt 
mix layer as well as the stiffness of the layers underneath (and supporting) the asphalt mix layer. 
Next comes the experimentation part to determine how many repetitions of the tensile stress/ 
strain the pavement can sustain before there is damage. This needs the development of a model, 
based on statistical analysis of experimental data, of the following form: 
Nf ˜ f°˝ ˙ or ˛ 11.1
where 
Nf
 is the number of repetitions to failure 
f(σ or ε) indicates “function” of initial stress or strain 
From this relationship, one can determine an Nf
 for a specifc σ or ε as determined with the layered 
elastic analysis. Before proceeding any further, note that Nf is a function of the tensile (σ or ε) for a 
specifc material or, more precisely, for a material with a specifc modulus (or stiffness). A simple 
analogy to illustrate this concept is that a stiffer paper clip can be bent fewer times before it snaps, 
compared to a more fexible paper clip, provided they are both “bent” (or strained) to the same 
extent. Indeed, a more complete way to express Nf
 would be to say, 
Nf ˜ f°˝ or ˙ and E˛ 11.2 
where E is the dynamic modulus. 
Note that the same asphalt mix has different E at different temperatures. So a test run with 
the same mix, but at different temperatures, would yield the required data for constructing the Nf 
model. How does one arrive at this model? 
Suppose one conducts an experiment with an asphalt mix beam over four supports and loaded 
at two points in the middle, commonly referred to as the third-point loading test. This loading con￾fguration results in a uniform bending moment over the middle portion of the beam. The loading 
is applied repetitively to simulate the repeated loading of traffc. Note that the intent of this testing 
is to cause cracking failure in the beam through initiation and propagation of the cracks by load￾ing. The test can be conducted in two ways. Either a load is applied such that the stress in the beam 
remains constant from the beginning, or the load is varied such that the strain in the beam remains 
constant. If a constant stress is used, as the beam gets damaged, the strain will keep on increasing, 
while in the constant strain model, as the beam gets damaged, the load will need to be decreased to 
keep the strain at the same level. 
Whether to use constant stress or constant strain depends on the thickness of the asphalt mix 
layer that is being considered for design. For thicker layers, strains would quickly increase with a 
decrease in the stiffness of the asphalt mix layer, and the constant stress mode is applicable; whereas 
for thinner layers, where strains would remain constant and are primarily dictated by the stiffness of 
the layers underneath the asphalt layer, constant strain is applicable. In a constant stress test in the 
laboratory, the strain will increase, and the beam would fail relatively quickly after the initiation of 
the crack. In a controlled strain test, the time for crack propagation is long, and failure would take a 
relatively long time. To end the test, sometimes “failure” is defned as the point where the modulus 
of the mix has decreased to one-half of its original modulus. For asphalt pavement layers less than 
6 in. in thickness, typically constant strain is generally used. 
ISTUDYDistress Mechanisms and Material Characterization for Asphalt 281 
Center-point loading is used for tests with a rubber pad underneath the beam to simulate an elastic 
foundation, while third-point loading (most commonly, AASHTO T 321, Method for Determining 
the Fatigue Life of Compacted Hot Mix Asphalt [HMA], Subjected to Repeated Flexural Bending) 
is generally used in tests without an elastic foundation. Note that other tests include the indirect 
tension test where a compressive load is used on the cylindrical specimen to develop tensile stresses 
along the diametral axis, tests with either rectangular or trapezoidal section cantilever beams, and 
the direct tension test of rectangular beams. 
Typically, 12–15in. long and 2–3in. wide and deep asphalt mix beam samples are used in this 
test, where the load is applied at the third points in the form of a haversine wave, with 0.1s duration 
and then 0.4s rest (Figure 11.1). Tests are run to span a range of stress such that the beams fail within 
a range of a small (1,000) to large (say, 1,000,000) number of repetitions. Each generates one data 
point, consisting of a strain and the number of repetitions to failure.

11.1.1 MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION TESTS 
Typically pneumatic, hydraulic, or electric equipment are used for testing unbound and bound pave￾ment material samples. These samples are either, typically, cylindrical, with a 1.5 to 2 diameter to 
height ratio or 100/150 mm in diameter with 38 to 76 mm in thickness. Test samples can be used 
either straight from compaction or cored out from compacted specimens. 
Generally, unbound material samples are tested with the repeated application of confning pres￾sure, using 0.1 s loading and 0.9 s rest. Samples can be 71 mm diameter/142 mm heigh or 150 mm 
diameter/300 mm high. Test temperature is generally 20–22oC, commonly referred to as room 
temperature, although tests below freezing are conducted. The applied axial stress and confning 
stresses are dependent on the test protocol—generally a range of combinations those parameters 
are used to determine resilient modulus (and its relationship with deviator and confning stress), 
the most commonly used design parameter for unbound materials. For confning stresses, a typical 
range is 14 to 140 kPa, whereas loads in the range of 5 to 25 KN may be required for axial loading 
depending on the sample size. Testing consists of obtaining a series of data points at each state and 
is terminated above a specifc strain limit in the sample, such as 5%. Usually only vertical defor￾mation is measured with two sensors unless horizontal deformation is needed for Poisson’s ratio 
estimate. 
For asphalt mixes, in the case of relatively tall cylindrical samples, usually 100 mm diameter by 
150 mm height are used. The test temperature may range from −10C to 60oC, with the higher range 
typically needed for the determination of master curve. The loading wave is of sinusoidal type, and 
the tests are conducted in stress-controlled mode to keep the dynamic strain within a range, such as 
75 to 125 µε, with a seating stress of 5% of dynamic stress. The frequency of loading ranges from 
0.1 to 25 Hz, with a loading up to 25 KN, depending on the sample size, with or without confning 
stress, generally up to 210 kPa. Some tests such as fow time may require a loading form of ramp 
up and steady/creep type, until there is a minimum creep rate or strain. Generally, z-axis strains are 
measured during the test. 
In some cases, typically for tests conducted in indirect tensile mode, the smaller cylinders/com￾pacted sampled are used. These include creep, resilient modulus, and fracture properties. Both z 
and x-axis strains are measured. Tests may involve either ramped up and creep loading or 0.1 to 
0.4 s load followed by a rest or repeated sinusoidal loading. Thermal fracture tests are generally 
conducted at low temperatures such as −10oC, whereas the highest temperature is usually 40oC. 
Pneumatic equipment is generally not capable of achieving adequate loading at lower temperatures, 
and hydraulic equipment is required. Test data are usually obtained at 1, 10, and 20 Hz frequencies. 
Generally, two criteria are considered during the selection of load capacity of testing equipment: 
maximum traffc induced stress that needs to be simulated, and the maximum strength (generally 
compressive or tensile or fexural) of the material being tested. For stabilized and asphalt mixes 
ISTUDYDistress Mechanisms and Material Characterization for Asphalt 283 
tensile and fexural strengths generally range from 15–35% of their compressive strengths. On the 
other hand, maximum traffc induces stresses range from about 25 psi (170 kPa) in base courses, 
to 100 psi (700 kPa) for truck tire pressure, and 350 psi (2,400 kPa) for military combat aircraft 
tire pressure. Note that the maximum pavement surface contact stress can be as high as almost two 
times the tire pressures (Sebaaly and Tabatabaee, 1989); however, it dissipates rapidly with depth. 
Maximum indirect tensile strength of asphalt and stabilized mixes are generally found to be around 
250 psi (1,700 kPa). 
Before moving on to the various fatigue cracking models, it is appropriate to discuss the four 
important tests that are run to characterize HMA. 
11.1.1.1 Indirect Tensile Strength: Test Method 
In the indirect tensile test (ASTM D 4123, SHRP Protocol P07), a load is applied diametrically to 
a cylindrical sample of HMA until it fails. The load is applied at a deformation rate of 2 in./min 
(Figure 11.2).

11.1.1.2 Resilient Modulus 
In resilient modulus testing (ASTM D 4123, SHRP Protocol P07), a haversine load is applied to a 
sample to determine the resulting deformation and calculate resilient modulus, which is defned 
as the ratio of stress and resilient strain (as opposed to viscous strain) in an asphalt mix sample. 
Generally, for asphalt mix samples, the test is carried out in indirect tensile mode, as shown in 
Figure 11.3. The haversine load utilized in the protocol has a period of 0.1s, followed by an appro￾priate rest period, generally 0.9 s. The tensile strength of each replicated set is determined prior 
to testing by performing an indirect tensile test on a companion specimen. The magnitude of the 
applied load causes tensile stress levels within the specimen equivalent to 30%, 15%, and 5% of 
the tensile strength at 25°C, at 5°C, 25°C, and 40°C, respectively; and the seating load is 3%, 1.5%, 
and 0.5% (10% of the applied load) of the specimen tensile strength measured at 25°C, at each of 
the three test temperatures, respectively. The sample is placed under a diametrical repeated load￾ing equipment with linear variable displacement transducers (LVDTs) placed on both sides of the 
horizontal diameter to measure horizontal deformations. The loading is applied on top through a 
horizontal metal bar, and the sample is rested at the bottom on a similar bar. The horizontal bar 
provides the distributed load along the edge of the sample. An example is shown in Figure 11.4. 
11.1.1.3 Dynamic Modulus (AASHTO TP 62–03) 
Dynamic modulus (E*) is defned as the absolute value of the complex modulus calculated by divid￾ing the maximum (peak-to-peak) stress by the recoverable (peak-to-peak) axial strain for a material 
subjected to sinusoidal (repeated vertical) loading (Figure 11.5).

Generally a (log) T (in Rankine) versus log-log viscosity plot is generated from asphalt test 
data obtained at a few temperatures, and then A (intercept) and VTS (slope) of the plot are 
determined to develop a regression equation relating viscosity to temperature. This equation is 
then used to predict the viscosity at temperatures spanning the relevant range. An example is 
shown in Table 11.1. 
Note that it is important to consider both temperature and loading time because of the fact that 
asphalt mixes are sensitive to those factors, as well as the fact that the temperature does vary over 
the months of a year (with changing seasons) at any specifc depth and, over the depths, at any 
specifc time. The loading time (which can be represented as the “width” of the loading pulse, in a 
time scale) varies with the depth of the pavement for any selected design speed of the vehicle. An 
example of variation of temperature with depth and months (for a pavement location in the state 
of Maine) is shown in Table 11.2, and the corresponding dynamic modulus values are shown in 
Table 11.3 (for a frequency of 10 Hz). Note that for practical purposes, all of the surface layer (and 
all of the base layer) HMA could be considered as one single layer, and dynamic modulus values 
are determined at a range of temperature that spans the highest and lowest temperatures that can be 
expected in that layer. 
Temperatures in pavements can be determined from available data, thermocouples, and/or equa￾tions, such as those shown in Table 11.4. 
The data of E* versus frequency obtained at various test temperatures are shifted with respect 
to frequency until the plots produced with E* versus frequency data at the different temperatures 
merge into one smooth curve, which is known as a master curve. Shifting means redrawing the 
plots at a “reduced frequency.” The shift is made with respect to a specifc temperature, called the

reference temperature. For example, data collected at −10, 0, 10, 20 and 30°C at frequencies of 0.1, 
0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 20Hz are shifted to a reference temperature of 20°C. The horizontal shifting in 
frequency at any specifc temperature is achieved through the use of a shift factor. The shift factor 
aT, is defned aT = fr
/f, where fr
 is the “reduced” frequency and f is the test frequency. The shift factor 
at the reference temperature is 0. 
There are a number of ways to estimate shift factors (a comparison given by Yusoff et al., 2011). 
The most popular method is by using numerical, nonlinear least squares method by assuming a 
sigmoidal ftting function of the master curve and MS Excel solver function. In this approach, 
no specifc form of relationship between shift factor and temperature is assumed (Pellinen et al., 
2002) and the shift factors are solved simultaneously with the coeffcients of the model. 
A freely available software, Mastersolver (available at https://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/ 
nchrp/docs/NCHRP09-29_mastersolver2-2.xls) can be used to read the raw data of E* at different 
frequencies and temperatures (generally three temperatures and four frequencies); see AASHTO

11.1.1.3.1 Asphalt Viscosity 
Note that η = viscosity of asphalt is needed in the predictive equation. The viscosity of unaged 
asphalt can be represented as follows: 
ISTUDYDistress Mechanisms and Material Characterization for Asphalt 291 
log log˜ ° A V˛ TSlog TR 11.16 
where 
η = viscosity of asphalt, cP 
TR = temperature, Rankine 
A = regression intercept 
VTS = regression slope (Viscosity Temperature Susceptibility) 
The A and the VTS parameters can be obtained from DSR tests or by using viscosity, softening 
points, and penetration test results. 
Note that as the HMA is produced and laid down and also as it stays on the pavement, it is 
continuously subjected to aging (production-laydown—short term aging, feld performance—long￾term aging) 
The Global Aging System (GAS) provides models to predict the change in asphalt properties due 
to aging that happens during mixing-laydown (short-term aging) and in the feld (known as surface 
aging), and also to account for the effect of VTM (construction VTM and its change over time) as 
well as the depth of the layer (asphalt binder closer to the surface will undergo a higher degree of 
oxidative aging). Note that the long-term aging model uses the results from the short-term aging 
model, which uses the original viscosity.

11.1.1.3.7 Semicircular Bending (SCB) Test 
The Semicircular bending (SCB) (AASHTO T 105-13, Determining the Fracture Energy of Asphalt 
Mixtures Using the Semicircular Bend Geometry [SCB]) test has become popular in the last few 
years as a test method for the evaluation of fracture properties of mixes containing high amounts 
of RAP (or high amounts of asphalt binder contributed by the RAP) to prevent fatigue cracking 
potential at intermediate temperatures. The test (Figure 11.8) consists of a simple three point bend￾ing at a loading at a rate of 50 mm/min conducted until the load drops down to 0.1 kN, which is also 
the initial contact load (the curve is extrapolated to 0.1 kN if the test is stopped before it reaches 
that load). 
For mixes with NMAS ≤ 19 mm, the specimens could be obtained from standard Superpave gyra￾tory compacted specimens or feld cores. The procedure consists of compacting a 160 mm thick SGC 
specimen and then slicing of two cylindrical specimens from the middle of the compacted specimen. 
Each of these cylindrical specimens is then cut in two identical halves-semicircular specimens. A 
notch is then cut along the axis of symmetry of each half, 15 ± 0.5 mm in length and ≤ 1.5 mm in 
width. 
The test has been shown to have good repeatability and can be conducted in a relatively simple 
test frame (used for Marshall or AASHTO T 283 indirect tensile test). The test is conducted on a 
semicircular specimen with a prefabricated notch at the center. The fracture energy (FE) is calcu￾lated from parameters obtained from this test at 25°C. A relatively new parameter, the fexibility 
index (FI) has been recently proposed by Illinois Center for Transportation (University of Illinois 
at Urbana-Champaign) and has been shown to have a better correlation with feld cracking results. 
While the work of energy and fracture energy is calculated by adding the two parts of the curve 
(left and right of the peak load by integrating the curve functions) of the load versus displacement

11.1.1.4 Texas Overlay Tester (Texas OT) 
The Texas Overlay Tester (OT) is a test equipment that is used to estimate the refective cracking and 
fatigue (bottom-up) cracking potential of HMA (Zhou and Scullion, 2004). During the test, repeated 
direct tension is applied to a HMA sample and the load, displacement, and temperature are recorded. 
In this equipment, a specially cut Superpave gyratory specimen or feld core (dense graded or PFC) is 
glued partly on a fxed block and partly on a movable block—the latter slides by a certain amount and 
comes back to its original position cyclically during the test. The test runs until the maximum initial

11.1.2 MODELS 
Fatigue cracking models relating the number of load repetitions to failure have been developed by 
different agencies, as shown in Table 11.6. Note that the models use different parameters, and each 
one is applicable for the specifc defnition of failure based on which model has been developed. 
Relationships between log failure strain and log resilient modulus have been developed, and a longer 
fatigue life is indicated by a relatively larger tensile strain at failure for a specifc modulus value. 
ISTUDYDistress Mechanisms and Material Characterization for Asphalt 299 
 
11.31 
The models shown in Table 11.6 are based on empirical test methods and parameters. The second 
approach for characterizing fatigue behavior of asphalt mix is with the use of the concept of dis￾sipated energy under dynamic loading, using either a fexural center-point or a third-point fatigue 
test. The following equation can be used (Tangella et al., 1990):

Another method is the use of concepts of fracture mechanics, in which stress and fracture toughness 
are utilized. The steps are based on the original work by Paris et al. (1961), and are as follows:

11.1.2.1 Simplifed Viscoelastic Continuum Damage (S-VECD) Model 
The use of the Simplifed Viscoelastic Continuum Damage (S-VECD) Model (Underwood et al., 
2012) has gained rapid momentum in the last few years as a method to characterize the cracking 
potential of HMA. The approach provides a mathematically rigorous way of combining the linear 
viscoelastic properties and damage potential to predict cracking parameter or number of cycles to 
failure, for both top-down and bottom-up fatigue cracking. The framework can be implemented 
in structural analysis tools such as FEM. Model parameters can be obtained from tests conducted 
on Superpave gyratory specimens in a relatively short period of time with the AMPT. Dynamic 
modulus test data are also required for the use of this model. The relevant standard is AASHTO 
T400 (Determining the Damage Characteristic Curve and Failure Criterion Using the Asphalt 
Mixture Performance Tester (AMPT) Cyclic Fatigue Test and AASHTO TP133 (Determining the 
Damage Characteristic Curve and Failure Criterion Using Small Specimens in the Asphalt Mixture

11.1.3 DEFINITION OF FAILURE 
Note that the number of repetitions at which the pavement will fail in the feld is signifcantly dif￾ferent from the number of repetitions that is indicated in the laboratory because of discrepancies 
ISTUDYDistress Mechanisms and Material Characterization for Asphalt 301 
 
between feld and laboratory loading conditions. These discrepancies include lateral wandering of 
the traffc in the feld versus loading over the same spot in the laboratory and rest periods in the feld 
being much longer than those in the laboratory. Also, while crack initiation and a resulting decrease 
in modulus, for example, are taken as failures in the laboratory, it is the visual manifestation of 
cracks that is considered as a sign of failure in the feld. To be visible on the surface, the cracks 
after initiation at the bottom need to propagate to the surface, and the process takes time. A funda￾mental discrepancy could also be that while according to elastic theory the tensile stresses/strains 
are always maximum at the bottom of the asphalt mix layer, due to rapid cooling of the surface and 
the formation of a rigid layer over a relatively soft layer, the cracks could initiate somewhere in the 
middle of the layer in the feld. 
Whatever the discrepancies may be, actually observed Nf
 could be 10–100 times that of labora￾tory-obtained Nf
. Hence, the laboratory-obtained Nf
 values are multiplied by an appropriate “shift 
factor” derived from feld experience. One question at this point is as follows: to determine Nf
 in 
the feld (which is required for predicting the shift factor for a specifc location and class of asphalt 
mixes used by an agency), how would one determine whether a pavement has failed or not—in other 
words, what is the criterion for failure? 
Fatigue failure has been defned earlier. Structurally, a pavement is said to have failed by fatigue 
when one or more of the following conditions are noted within the scope of the project. Note that the 
more conservative criteria are used for interstate and freeway pavements, whereas the less conserva￾tive ones are used for primary or secondary routes. 
1. Over 45% of the wheel path shows fatigue cracking and crack deterioration around the edges. 
2. Over 20% of the wheel path area has severely deteriorated cracks with pieces moving 
under traffc. 
3. Around 20% of the entire pavement area has fatigue cracks. 
4. Around 37% of the wheel path area has fatigue cracks. 
11.1.4 USE OF MODELS 
The next step is to utilize the fatigue equations in design processes. Note that with changing sea￾sons, critical properties such as moduli of layers change cause a change in the tensile stresses/strains 
in the asphalt mix layer, and hence cause a change in the way damage occurs. Furthermore, if the 
traffc is different in different seasons, then the relative proportion of damage throughout a year dif￾fers also. To consider all these factors, the concept of cumulative damage (Miner, 1945) is used. It is 
assumed that accumulation of damage causes ultimate “failure” of a pavement, damage by fatigue 
failure is cumulative, and a cumulative damage factor or index is defned such that when it reaches 
a value of 1, the pavement is assumed to “fail.” 
The damage factor for the ith loading is defned as the number of actual repetitions (ni
) of load 
divided by the “allowable” repetitions (Ni
) that would cause failure. The total damage index, or the 
cumulative damage factor (CDF), for the parameter is given by summing the damage factors over 
all of the different loadings in the different seasons. 
Mathematically, this can be expressed as follows:

Nf(ij) is the allowable number of load repetitions for a specifc season (i) and load (j) determined from

The concept of an endurance limit has been proposed, which assumes that under a very small repeti￾tive strain, an asphalt mix layer can sustain infnite or a very large number of loads (such as > 10 
million). The concept of long life or perpetual pavement is based on this theory. Suggested values of 
such low strains include 100, 70, and 65 microstrains. Details of a study conducted by NCHRP can 
be found at http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_rpt_646.pdf. 
11.1.5 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MIX DESIGN AND FATIGUE PERFORMANCE 
The fatigue characteristics of an asphalt mix are dictated by its materials—types and relative pro￾portions, as well as mix volumetric properties—and are refected in its mechanical properties. The 
different materials and properties are discussed next. 
Aggregate: The effect of percentage of material passing the No. 200 sieve is signifcant—this 
material increases the fatigue resistance up to an optimum content and then reduces it beyond 
that content. The more angular the fne aggregate is, the more resistant it is to fatigue failure. 
Asphalt: Both asphalt properties and amount (asphalt content in the mix) are signifcant. As 
discussed in Chapter 9, the stiffness and the phase angle are controlled [(G*) * (Sinδ)] to 
maintain suffcient fatigue resistance through limiting the stiffness (G*) and the phase 
angle (δ). A higher asphalt content provides greater fatigue resistance. 
Air voids/density: A high density (low air voids) is better for fatigue cracking resistance. 
Note that some of the properties also affect the aging of the binder and hence affect its fatigue 
properties indirectly, since a higher rate of aging increases stiffness and reduces the resistance 
against fatigue failure. For example, a higher asphalt content and/or a higher density reduces the 
potential of aging of the binder and reduces the potential of deterioration of fatigue resistance. 
11.1.6 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAVEMENT STRUCTURE AND 
FATIGUE PERFORMANCE 
The fatigue resistance of the asphalt mix layer is also affected by the structure of the asphalt 
pavement—the thickness of the asphalt mix and base course layer. Depending on the magnitude of 
the load and tire pressures, a very thin asphalt mix layer (e.g., less than 2in.) will not generate tensile 
stresses/strains and will not be susceptible to bottom-up fatigue failure; a moderately thin asphalt 
layer will be susceptible to fatigue failure; a thick asphalt pavement (e.g., > 8in.) will defnitely be 
very resistant to fatigue failure because of the low tensile stress/strain. Both thickness and modu￾lus of the base course are important since they contribute to the overall stiffness of the pavement 
structure—a high modulus and a thicker layer improve fatigue resistance. 
Finally, the wheel load is an important factor—a higher load naturally increases the potential of 
fatigue cracking. 
11.1.6.1 Steps for Avoiding Premature Fatigue Cracking 
To consider all of the important factors, the following steps can be taken, in general, to provide 
adequate resistance to fatigue cracking: 
1. Adopt a standard maximum load. 
2. Select appropriate materials for different layers so that they have desirable fatigue resis￾tance properties. 
ISTUDYDistress Mechanisms and Material Characterization for Asphalt 303
3. Design the mixes (for the base as well as asphalt mix layers, for example) such that the 
volumetric properties are at the desirable level for adequate fatigue resistance.
4. Considering the mechanical properties of the designed mixes, design the pavement struc￾ture such that the overall stiffness of the structure is adequate.
5. Construct the pavement such that the controllable properties are brought up/down to desir￾able levels, as determined in Step 3.
Readers are advised to refer to a very comprehensive discussion of fatigue cracking evaluation 
that has been presented by Underwood and Braham (2016; www.andrewbraham.com/AAPT_
Fatigue_2016.pdf).
11.2 THERMAL CRACKING
Thermal cracking occurs in two ways: (1) when the thermal stresses due to a drop in tempera￾ture exceed the fracture strength of the material (low-temperature cracking), and (2) when, due to 
repeated thermal cycles, the strain in the asphalt layers causes thermal fatigue cracking. The poten￾tial of thermal cracking of a mix is evaluated by evaluating the mix stiffness and fracture strength 
characteristics with respect to temperature and time of loading.
The tensile strengths of asphalt mixes change with a change in temperature. As the tempera￾ture in the pavement drops (from the surface, which is in contact with the cold air that causes the 
drop in temperature), the tensile strength keeps increasing, but beyond a point, due to microcracks 
at the aggregate-asphalt interface, it does not increase anymore and actually begins to decrease 
(Figure 11.9). On the other hand, as the temperature drops, the asphalt mix layer tends to shrink 
but is restrained by friction with the layers underneath. If the stress builds up relatively slowly, 
then it can be dissipated through stress relaxation in the viscoelastic asphalt mix at temperatures 
above 70°F. However, at lower temperatures, depending on the rate at which temperature drops and 
the properties of the asphalt mix components and the mix, the built-up stress exceeds the tensile 
strength (at that specific temperature), causing a crack on the surface.
Similar to load-related fatigue cracking, repetitive alternate cycles of high stress (due to a drop in 
temperature at night) and low stress (due to warmer temperatures during the day) can cause crack￾ing (thermal fatigue cracking). The number of stress cycles required to cause failure depends on the 
magnitude of the repeated high stress and the thermal fatigue-related properties of the mix, which 
include the effects of viscoelastic properties as well as aging.

11.2.1 MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION 
For low-temperature cracking, the drop in temperature and the rate at which it drops are both impor￾tant. The effect can be quantifed with the creep modulus parameter—a higher value indicates a 
lower relaxation of stress, and hence a higher potential of buildup of thermal stress and cracking. 
The creep modulus is affected primarily by the low-temperature properties of the asphalt binder, 
and appropriate tests have been discussed in Chapter 9. The tests include the bending beam rhe￾ometer test (to evaluate stiffness and rate of relaxation) and direct tension test (to evaluate strain at 
failure). 
Asphalt mix properties: The low-temperature indirect tensile creep test is used to determine 
the two properties that are used: the indirect tensile strength and the creep modulus. The 
test is run by applying a load at the rate of 1.25 mm/min at a temperature ranging from 
0°C to −20°C, for 100–3600 s. 
Indirect tensile strength/creep compliance test: This test (AASHTO T 322) is conducted to 
determine the tensile strength (as discussed earlier) as well as the indirect tensile creep 
compliance, which is defned as the ratio of time-dependent strain to the applied stress. 
The sample setup is shown in Figure 11.10. In the test for creep compliance, a stress is 
applied quickly and then maintained constantly throughout a period of time. The applied 
load and the resulting vertical and horizontal deformations are measured (as a function of 
time), and the creep compliance D(t) is calculated as follows:

The compliance, D(t), is used to calculate the relaxation modulus, E, which is used for predicting 
thermal stress in the asphalt mix. Paris’ law is then used to determine the development of cracks.

Typical values of coeffcient of thermal contraction of asphalt mixes have been reported as 1.17– 
2.05 * 10−5/°F (2.11–3.69 * 10−5/°C). 
As part of the SHRP, the thermal stress restrained specimen test (TSRST) was developed to 
determine fracture temperature and fracture strength for low temperature thermal cracking of 
asphalt mixes (Vinson et al., 1989). In this test, a specimen is restrained in a chamber in which the 
temperature is dropped at a constant rate. As the specimen tries to contract, it is maintained at a 
constant length through a computer-controlled feedback loop system, and the time, temperature, 
tensile load, and deformation are measured up to the point at which the specimen fails. Several 
inferences can be made from the thermally induced stress versus temperature data and their plot 
(Figure 11.11). 
11.2.2 MODELS 
The thermal cracking prediction models are based on the approach of predicting a critical tem￾perature below which an asphalt mix layer is expected to crack, and most methodologies combine 
the effect of low temperature and thermal fatigue cracking. The use of these methods requires 
the determination of environmental conditions (for the project site) and asphalt mix properties, 
some of which are determined, while the others are commonly taken from available values in the 
literature. 
11.2.2.1 Environmental Conditions 
The pavement temperature, in response to air temperature, could be determined with the help of the 
enhanced integrated climatic model (EICM; developed by Larson and Dempsey, 1997), based on 
the integrated climatic model (ICM; developed by Lytton et al., 1990). The model is based on the 
balance of heat transfer between the pavement and the environment, considering the three different

Using the predicted conditions and the asphalt mix properties, either regression equations or frac￾ture mechanics-based equations could be used to predict the extent of low temperature related 
cracking in an asphalt mix layer.

11.2.2.3 Fracture Mechanics Approach: SHRP Thermal Cracking Model 
There are three components of the thermal cracking distress model, which work on the basis of each 
other. The stress intensity model determines the stress at the tip of a local vertical crack, which is 
used to predict the depth of crack propagation, and, based on that, the crack amount model predicts 
the number of thermal cracks per unit length of the pavement. 
The time and temperature dependent relaxation modulus of asphalt mix, which refects its vis￾coelastic property, dictates the thermal stress developed in an asphalt mix layer during temperature 
drop. Mathematically, this is expressed as follows: 
dˆ ˇ ˛ ˜ °( ) ˝  0
°
E(° °’) ˘ ˙ d°˘ 11.45 
d°
where 
σ(ξ) is the stress at reduced time ξ
E(ξ − ξ′) is the relaxation modulus at reduced time (ξ − ξ′) 
ε is the strain at reduced time ξ = α(T(ξ′) − T0)) 
α is the linear coeffcient of thermal contraction 
T(ξ′) is the pavement temperature at reduced time ξ′
T0 is the pavement temperature when σ = 0 
ξ′is the variable of integration 
The relaxation modulus of asphalt mix can be represented by the Maxwell model for viscoelastic 
materials: 
N˘1 ˇ˜ ˛/ i E˝ ˙ ˜ ˆ ° Ei

where 
ξ is the reduced time = t/aT 
E(ξ) is the relaxation modulus at reduced time

Ei

 are the Prony series parameters 
ISTUDY308 Pavement Engineering 
The creep test is performed at multiple temperatures to determine the creep compliance D(t), from 
which the relaxation modulus function is obtained. 
The data are shifted from different temperatures to one continuous “master” creep compliance 
curve using a shift factor. 
˜ ˝/ i ˜ D˙ ˆ ˜ ˇD 0˙ ˆ˘ ° i ˘ n
D 1˙  e ˆ 11.47 i 1ˇ ˛v
where 
D(ξ) is the creep compliance at reduced time ξ
ξ is the reduced time = t/aT 
aT is the temperature shift factor 
D(0), Di
, τi
, ηv are the Prony series parameters 
A series of steps are needed to develop the master curve for creep compliance, using regression. 
1. Creep tests are conducted for different times of loading and temperature, and the results 
are plotted, with log D(t) and log(time), for the different temperatures (T). 
2. A reference temperature is selected, and all of the curves at the other temperatures are 
shifted onto this curve to result in one smooth master curve. The determination of the shift 
factors (as a function of the temperature) as well as of Prony series parameters is done with 
regression, using a least-square criterion. Four Prony series coeffcients are determined for 
data obtained at three temperatures. To complete the master curve, shift factors for tem￾peratures at which tests were run are determined on the basis of the regression relationship 
between the shift factor and temperature. 
3. An equation for the compliance curve is then developed to determine m, the slope of the 
linear portion of the log time versus log compliance curve: 
m D° ˛ ˜ ˝ D0 ˙ D1˜ 11.48 
where 
D0, D1, and m are the coeffcients of the equation 
m is the primary parameter that characterizes the low-temperature cracking potential of an 
asphalt mix 
The next step is the determination of the relaxation modulus, which enables one to determine 
the stress for causing thermal cracks. While the relaxation modulus can be approximated as just the 
inverse of the creep compliance, the more precise relationship is the following: 
sL[D(t)]*sL[E(t)] = 1 11.49 
where 
L[D(t)] is the Laplace transform of creep compliance, D(t) 
L[E(t)] is the Laplace transform of relaxation modulus, D(t) 
s is the Laplace parameter 
t is the time or reduced time, ξ
Using a computer program, the master relaxation modulus can be determined from the master creep 
compliance equation.

thermal stresses (as mentioned earlier):

where 
σ(ξ) is the stress at reduced time ξ
E(ξ − ξ′) is the relaxation modulus at reduced time, ξ − ξ′
ε is the strain at reduced time ξ (= α(T(ξ′) − T0)) 
T(ξ′) is the pavement temperature at reduced time ξ′
T0 is the pavement temperature when σ = 0 
ξ′ is the variable of integration 
The assumptions are that the HMA material is a thermorheologically simple material, allowing the 
use of the time-temperature superposition principle, and that the layer behaves as a uniaxial rod. 
The form of the equation with real time, t, is as follows:

The total crack depth is estimated by computing and summing up the change in crack depth (ΔC)

11.2.3 CRACKING AND PROPERTIES OF ASPHALTS AND AGGREGATES 
The resistance of an asphalt mix layer to thermal cracking can be controlled by a variety of param￾eters, which affect tensile strength and relaxation properties. Apart from the asphalt grade, which 
has the primary infuence, parameters such as asphalt content, air voids, and aggregate type and 
gradation have signifcant infuence. Based on multiscale analysis, low temperature creep properties 
ISTUDYDistress Mechanisms and Material Characterization for Asphalt 311 
 
of asphalt mastic have been found to be dependent on the volume fraction of the fller and not on the 
shape or mineralogy (Lackner et al., 2005). 
The effect of asphalt type has been discussed in Chapter 9. A high asphalt content results in a low 
creep modulus and hence lower potential of thermal cracking. Note that the effective asphalt content 
can be lowered by an absorptive aggregate (if not considered properly during mix design), which can 
increase the potential of cracking directly (or indirectly, by allowing the asphalt to age faster). The 
aging can also be accelerated by the presence of relatively high air voids, which can also decrease 
the tensile strength and increase the potential of cracking. The increase in tensile strength can be 
achieved by using appropriate gradation as well as aggregate with crushed faces. 
Table 11.7 shows a summary of the different types of tests that are currently being used regularly 
or in research for characterization of asphalt binders and HMA (for details, see Newcomb, 2021;

11.3 RUTTING OR PERMANENT DEFORMATION 
Rutting is the result of repeated loading, which causes accumulation, and increase of permanent 
deformations. The one-dimensional densifcation-consolidation rutting, resulting from a decrease 
in air voids, occurs with volume change and is vertical deformation only (primary rutting), whereas 
the two-dimensional rutting is caused by shear failure and is accompanied by both vertical and 
lateral movement of the material (secondary and tertiary rutting). 
The densifcation-consolidation rutting may be caused by the action of high stress load at high 
temperatures near the surface of the pavement which leads to a decrease in air voids of the asphalt 
mix, especially if they are too high compared to desirable air voids; and/or due to the densifcation 
of the underlying layers if they are at densities lower than the maximum dry density or desirable 
densities; or due to the consolidation of fne grained soils in the subgrade, for example, with high 
levels of moisture. The one-dimensional rutting mechanism can be relatively easily simulated in the 
laboratory. 
In the structural design of pavement, the rutting in a pavement is assumed to be caused by either 
or both of two causes—excessive strain in the subgrade or permanent deformation in any of the 
layers in the pavement. 
11.3.1 MATERIAL CHARACTERIZATION 
Any element in any layer in a pavement subjected to a moving load experiences a variety of stresses, 
which change as the load moves. Figure 11.12 shows the different stresses acting on an element— 
vertical, horizontal, and shear stress—as well as the phenomenon of stress reversal as the load 
changes position. 
For example, when the load is “near” any point near the bottom of a stiff surface layer, the 
point experiences compressive stress in the horizontal direction—this stress changes to a tensile 
stress when the load is directly above it. Because of the variety of stresses and stress reversals, it 
is extremely diffcult, if not impossible, to completely simulate such a stress state in the laboratory 
with any test procedure. As such, any one or more of different types of tests, varying in complexity 
and ability of simulation of in-place conditions, are used, depending on the level of sophistication 
required. Such tests may be “fundamental” or “simulative.” Fundamental tests create in-place load￾ing conditions with the help of complex loading equipment and allow the determination of funda￾mental parameters such as modulus, whereas simulative tests simulate in-place loading conditions, 
not necessarily with consideration of scale effects, but specifcally to “compare” the performance 
between different asphalt mixes. 
The relevant parameter that resists the assumed shear failure due to shear stress is the shear 
modulus:

where 
G is the shear modulus of an elastic material 
τ is the shear stress 
γ is the shear strain—angle, in radians, of deformation of the material due to the shear stress 
E is the Young’s modulus 
μ is the Poisson’s ratio 
Since G is affected by both time of loading (longer the time of loading lower is the G) and tempera￾ture (higher the temperature lower is the G), rutting is also affected by these parameters. 
11.3.1.1 Creep Testing 
The deformation of a pavement material in any of the layers begins with elastic deformation and 
then changes over to partly elastic and partly plastic (elastoplastic) and then changes to completely 
plastic deformation. In the case of asphalt mixes that consist of asphalt, which is a viscoelastic 
material, the elastic and plastic deformations also consist of viscoelastic and viscoplastic deforma￾tions. The deformations resulting from the temperature and time of loading-dependent viscoelastic 
and viscoplastic behavior cause rutting and can be simulated in the laboratory using either static or 
repeated load creep tests. In the creep test, the vertical strain in an asphalt mix sample subjected to 
ISTUDY320 Pavement Engineering 
a constant load (or repeated load), at a specifc temperature, is measured during and after the appli￾cation of the load. The static creep tests can be done either in uniaxial mode or with triaxial mode, 
which applies confning stress. 
The total strain, εT, consists of different components, as shown in Figure 11.13:

where 
εT is the total strain 
εe is the elastic strain, recoverable and time independent 
εp is the plastic strain, irrecoverable and time independent 
εve is the viscoelastic strain, recoverable and time dependent 
εvp is the viscoplastic strain, irrecoverable and time dependent 
Note that in creep tests, it is very important to have the loading faces of the sample smooth, par￾allel, and perpendicular to the loading head. The creep test can be run with one load-unload cycle or 
with incremental load-unload cycles, and the results provide the different deformations mentioned 
earlier. From the creep test, the creep modulus is calculated to determine the increase in elastic and 
plastic deformations at specifc loading times. The creep test is used specifcally for asphalt mixes 
(and not for other layer materials such as soils) because only the asphalt mixes generally have vis￾cous components with time-dependent stiffness and deformation properties: 
˝c E t˜ ° ˛ 11.59 c ˙T ˜ °t
where 
Ec(t) is the compressive creep modulus at time t 
σc is the compressive stress 
εT(t) is the compressive strain at time t 
Also measured is the percentage of recovery of the deformation in the elastic-plastic region of the 
deformation, for which a higher number indicates lower permanent deformation or lower potential 
of rutting:

where εr
 is the recoverable strain.
For viscoelastic material, the term compliance D(t) is used rather than modulus since D(t) allows 
the separation of the different deformation components. D(t) is approximately equal to the inverse of 
the modulus. Just like the deformation, the D(t) can be divided, with respect to time, into a primary, 
secondary, and tertiary component (Figure 11.14).
The secondary part of the curve can be modeled as follows, using a power regression curve:
D D ' = - (t) D = a(t)m
0 11.61
where
D′ is the viscoelastic compliance
D(t) is the total compliance at time t
D0 is the instantaneous compliance
t is the loading time
a, m are the coefficients for specific asphalt mix
The coefficients a and m are used to predict the mix’s rutting potential. A low a value is desirable 
since a large a value means a large D value and lower modulus value, and also, for a specific a, the 
higher the m value, the higher is the potential of permanent deformation.
11.3.1.2 Triaxial Test
From the triaxial repeated load tests, resilient modulus, ER; total plastic strain, εp; plastic strain per 
load cycle, εp(N); and strain ratio, εp/εr
, can be obtained. The resilient strain, εr
, is the recoverable 
strain during the rest period of the load cycle. The resilient shear modulus is the ratio of compressive 
stress to resilient axial strain. The strain ratio is the ratio of plastic strain to resilient strain.
In the triaxial shear strength test, a modification of AASHTO T 167 can be used with confining 
stress to develop a Mohr–Coulomb failure envelope, which is expressed as follows:
t - = +c t( ) anp 11.62
ISTUDY322 Pavement Engineering 
where 
τ is the shear stress 
σ is the normal stress 
c is the cohesion 
φ is the angle of internal friction, or the slope of the failure envelope 
This simulation is based on the assumption that the shear strength of HMA develops from cohe￾sion (c) from the asphalt binder and interlock of the aggregates matrix, which is characterized by 
the angle of internal friction (φ). The relative contributions of c and φ toward the shear strength of 
the mix are dependent on the time of loading, temperature, and volumetric properties of the mix. 
The results of triaxial tests can also be used for characterizing the behavior of the asphalt mix 
according to the Drucker-Prager failure envelope. In this model, the combined effect of failure 
stresses is represented in terms of the frst invariant stress tensor and the second invariant deviatoric 
stress tensor:

k is the intercept 
γ1/2 is the slope 
11.3.2 MODELS 
The use of the subgrade strain model ensures that there is suffcient cover over the subgrade to 
resist plastic deformation of the subgrade and, hence, resulting “ride-on” deformation in all of the 
layers above it. This is based on the assumption that the layers above the subgrade are designed and 
constructed properly so that there is no rutting in any of those layers. The form of the model is as 
shown next:

where 
Nf

Chapter 7)

b1, b2, b3 are the coeffcients derived from triaxial tests 
β is the feld calibration factor 
The predominant way of using this model is to limit the vertical subgrade strain to a specifc value 
such that the Nf

developed their own models based on this model—some of which do contain MR, and the rest con￾tain εv only. It is important to note that the models are developed for a specifc range of site, materi￾als, and environmental conditions, and that failure criteria (or, more specially, the specifc depth 
of rutting which is called a rutting failure) are different for the different models; one must use the 
same criteria for failure as those in the specifc model that is being used. Examples of such models 
are shown in Table 11.8. 
11.3.2.1 Consideration of Rutting in Asphalt Mix Only 
Rutting in the asphalt mix layer is caused specifcally by high temperature and standing traffc. 
At high temperatures, such as those above 60°C, the effect of repeated loading on the mix can be 
considered to be primarily dictated by the properties of the binder, such as viscosity. The infuence 
of binder and the measures taken to select an appropriate binder with adequate resistance against 
rutting have been discussed. 
The penetration index (PI) has been shown to relate (inversely) well with rutting. Rutting results 
from wheel tracking tests have been correlated well with creep stiffness measured from a uniaxial 
unconfned creep test. The deformation is inversely proportional to the stiffness of the mix, which 
is proportional to the stiffness of the binder, that can be derived from the PI of the binder. 
1 Deformation k = 11.67 1 Smix
Smix ˜ k2 °S ˛ 11.68 asphalt binder
where k3 has been suggested as 0.25; increasing the PI results in a signifcant increase in viscosity 
and decrease in rutting potential. 
For strains that cause rutting, the binder is assumed to remain in zero shear viscosity regime, 
with Newtonian fuid characteristics, in which stress and strain are linearly proportional to each 
other and the stiffness modulus is independent of the stress or strain level and the viscosity is 
independent of the shear rate. Such viscosity can be measured by a dynamic shear rheometer. 
A practical upper limit of zero shear viscosity has been proposed as 105 Pa s. The value of the 
zero shear viscosity or the shear complex modulus and elastic component of the binder, as rep￾resented by G*/sin delta, for example, can be used to evaluate the rutting potential of an asphalt 
binder.

The effect of asphalt mix properties can be modeled for rutting prediction in different ways, such 
as through the use of statistical (regression) equations or through the use of material characteriza￾tion parameters, as shown next.

11.3.2.3 Layered Vertical Permanent Strain Approach 
In the layered vertical permanent strain approach, the permanent strain in each layer is determined 
as a function of load repetitions, the deformation is calculated by multiplying the strain times the 
layer thickness, and then the deformation in different layers is added up to determine total rutting 
which is visible on the surface of the pavement. One such model recommended by Barenberg and 
Thompson (1992) is of the form: 
Log° ˛ ˜p ˝ ˙a b lˆ og° ˛ N ˘ 11.71 ˇ 
where 
εp is the permanent strain 
a, b are the empirical coeffcients 
N is the number of load repetitions 
ISTUDYDistress Mechanisms and Material Characterization for Asphalt 325 
As suggested by Huang (1993), the steps consist of (1) dividing the pavement structure into a number 
of layers, (2) estimating vertical and radial stresses at the mid-depth of each layer, (3) conducting 
repeated load tests in the lab using the estimated vertical stress and radial stress plus overburden 
stress as confning stress, (4) determining permanent strain, (5) computing vertical deformation by 
multiplying permanent strain by thickness, and (6) adding the permanent strains in all of the layers 
to obtain rutting at the surface. 
Examples of such models are shown in Table 11.9.

11.3.2.7 Alternate Model Relating Tertiary Flow Characteristics 
to Mix Properties 
Since many of the aforementioned equations use regression coeffcients derived from the secondary 
rutting part of tests, the rutting resulting from tertiary rutting is ignored, resulting in a lower than 
actual rutting prediction. An alternative method is as follows. 
In the tertiary zone, the material does not undergo any volume change, but there is a large 
increase in compliance, D(t). The starting point of tertiary deformation, known as fow time (FT; 
see Figure 11.13; see also Witczak et al., 2000), has been shown to be a signifcant indicator of the 
mix’s rutting potential. Flow time is defned as the time at which the shear deformation without any 
volume change starts. 
Another parameter that has been used to relate to the mix’s permanent deformation potential is 
the fow number, FN (Figure 11.15), which is defned as the number of cycles at which tertiary per￾manent strain begins when the permanent strain is plotted against the number of cycles. This type 
of plot is generated from data obtained in an unconfned or confned repeated load test in which a 
haversine load is applied for, say, 3 h of 10,000 cycles with a loading time of 0.1 s and rest period of 
0.9s. The results of these tests are plotted on a log (N) versus log εp scale, and the linear portion is 
modeled as a power curve with intercepts as a and slope as b:

The equilibrium moisture content of an unbound material can be predicted from the groundwater 
table depth and in-place modulus using regression models which were developed on the basis of 
variables used with the enhanced integrated climatic model (EICM). The EICM uses the soil water 
characteristic curve (SWCC; variation of water storage capacity within the macro and micro pores 
of a soil, with respect to suction), which is generally plotted as variation of water content with soil 
suction. The SWCC prediction can be made by the use of equations proposed by Fredlund and 
Xing (1994). To avoid direct measurement of soil suction, the parameters of the Fredlund and Xing 
equation were ftted to soil index properties—percentage passing the No. 200 sieve (P200), D60, and 
plasticity index (PI). When the PI of a soil > 0, the SWCC parameters are correlated with P200 * PI; 
if the PI is zero, the parameters correlated with D60. Other important properties are specifc gravity 
of solids (Gs) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (ksat), both of which can be estimated from P200 * 
PI and D60 values if no feld or laboratory value is available. 
The steps in the calculation of equilibrium moisture corresponding to different CBR and GWT 
depths content are shown in Table 11.12 (NCHRP, 2004). 
11.3.3 DEFINITION OF FAILURE 
An asphalt pavement is said to have failed by rutting when the rut depth at the surface exceeds 
13 mm or 0.5 in. 
The concept of incremental rutting in each layer and summing up rutting in all of the layers to 
get the total rutting has been used in several models. The steps include determination of the resilient 
strain, then the plastic strain, and then the rut depth at each depth, and fnally summing up the ruts 
through the layer to get the total rutting in the layers:

11.4 SMOOTHNESS CONSIDERATION 
Smoothness is a measure of ride quality as perceived by the user. Smoothness is affected signifcantly 
by rutting, rut depth variance, and fatigue cracking. The smoothness of the initial (newly constructed) 
pavement is an indicator of the future smoothness since it indicates the overall quality of construction 
of the pavement as well as the rate of deterioration of smoothness over time. Different researchers have 
come up with different lists of factors affecting smoothness. They include initial smoothness, ESAL, age, 
base thickness, freezing index, initial international roughness index (IRI), type of subgrade, thickness of 
overlay, maximum and minimum temperatures, and the annual number of wet days. Researchers have

11.5 TOP-DOWN CRACKING 
Top-down cracking initiates at the surface, generally in the wheel path. It can extend up to 1in. or 
the depth of the top layer and leads to ingress of water and the raveling and formation of potholes. 
The primary cause of top-down cracking is the failure of the surface mix as a result of excessive 
surface shear and tensile stresses from tires (generally truck tires). The excessive stress can be due to 
one or many factors, including anomalies in load distribution, axle confguration, axle loadings, tire 
types, rigidity, as well as tire condition and pressures. The failure could be accelerated because of 
poor mix qualities that could result from many factors, including segregation, inadequate density, and 
premature aging of asphalt binder. 
The best approach to avoid such problems, where high tensile and shear stresses on the surface 
are expected, is to use HMA mixes with adequate resistance against such stresses—such as those 
with polymer-modifed binders. Top-down cracks, once found, should be sealed as soon as possible 
to avoid ingress of moisture and further rapid deterioration of the layer. 
A fracture mechanics-based design method to consider top-down cracking has been developed 
in NCHRP project 01-42A (fnal report available at http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/ 
nchrp_w162.pdf). 
The researchers have proposed two separate mechanisms to explain and predict the initiation 
of top-down cracking in thin and medium HMA layers and thicker HMA layers. The mechanism 
governing the initiation of a crack in thin HMA is related to bending-induced surface tension 
away from the tire, while the other that infuences the initiation of crack in thicker HMA is related 
to shear-induced near-surface tension at the tire edge. For both mechanisms, the exacerbating 
factor is aging of the mix. The other infuential factors are the presence of thermal stresses and 
damage zones. Two models have been presented by the researchers as part of a unifed predictive 
system: a viscoelastic continuum damage (VECD) model to predict crack initiation by model￾ing damage zones and their effect on response prior to cracking (i.e., damage zone effects) and 
an HMA fracture mechanics (HMA-FM) model to predict crack propagation by modeling the 
ISTUDYDistress Mechanisms and Material Characterization for Asphalt 339 
 
 
presence of macrocracks and their effect on response (i.e., macrocrack effects). The models are 
yet to be developed to a state at which they could be integrated into a mechanistic-empirical pave￾ment design method. 
11.5.1 PAVEMENT SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS 
The important pavement surface characteristics include pavement surface friction, pavement-tire 
noise, and splash and spray during rains. Macropavement and micropavement surface texture have 
the most signifcant effect on these characteristics, whereas megatexture and roughness have more 
infuence on ride quality, rolling resistance, vehicle wear, and in-vehicle noise. 
Pavement microtexture is largely infuenced by the surface properties of the aggregate particles 
within the asphalt or concrete paving material and is characterized by wavelength of 1 μm–0.5 mm 
and amplitude of less than 0.2 mm. Two portable friction testers are utilized to get a surrogate 
indication of microtexture in pavements: the British portable tester (BPT) and the dynamic friction 
tester (DFT). In the BPT test, (AASHTO T 278) a pendulum with a rubber shoe is swung while 
touching the surface of aggregates that are embedded in a holder. The British pendulum number 
(BPN) gives an indication of the friction of the aggregates (and hence its microtexture) in terms of 
the resistance offered by the aggregates in slowing the swinging pendulum down across its surface. 
In the DFT, torque required to rotate three small, spring-loaded rubber pads in a circular path over 
a wetted pavement surface at different speeds (ASTM E 1911) is measured. Correlations between 
torque measurements and BPN are available. 
Pavement macrotexture wavelengths range from 0.5 to 50 mm with vertical amplitudes between 
0.1 and 20 mm. Macrotexture in HMA pavements is determined by the shape, size, and gradation of 
aggregates. In PCC pavements it is infuenced by small surface channels, grooves, or indentations 
that are intentionally formed (plastic concrete) or cut (hardened concrete) to allow water to escape 
from beneath a vehicle’s tires. A high mean texture depth (MTD) (such as > 1.5mm) is necessary for 
avoiding traffc-related accidents. Macrotexture can be measured by traditional volumetric meth￾ods as well as sophisticated high-speed laser proflers. In the “sand patch” method (ASTM E 965), 
a specifed volume of very small glass spheres (ASTM D 1155) is spread on the surface, and the 
MTD is estimated by dividing the known volume of the glass spheres used by the area of the circle 
(whose average diameter is calculated by measuring on four axes). For laser profling, the MTD is 
estimated from the mean profle depth (MPD), which is determined by the measurement of pave￾ment surface elevations (ASTM E 1845). Generally, a combination of a horizontal distance measur￾ing device, a very high-speed laser triangulation sensor, and a portable computer are utilized. In 
the outfow meter method (OFM, ASTM E 2380), the time required for a known volume of water to 
pass from a vertical cylinder resting on a rubber annulus through the pavement is determined. The 
outfow time (OFT) is used as an indicator of macrotexture (smooth or rough). Another method of 
measuring the macrotexture is the use of the circular texture (track) meter (CTM) (E 2157). In this 
method, a noncontact laser device is used to measure the profle of a 11.2 in. diameter circle. The 
MPD is calculated after dividing the measured profle into eight segments of 4.4 in. The MPD is 
highly correlated to MTD.

Mix and Structural Design 12 of Asphalt Mix Layers 
Structural design of asphalt pavements can be done primarily in two ways—either through the use 
of charts and nomographs that have been developed on the basis of experiments and/or experience 
(empirical method) or in part through the use of principles of mechanics and in part through results 
obtained from experiments and/or experience (mechanistic-empirical [ME]). 
Note that while the tendency for structural design has been to move from purely empirical to 
mechanistic-empirical methods (to reduce uncertainties regarding extrapolation of data), mix design 
has more or less remained primarily dependent on empirical relationships between volumetric prop￾erties and distress levels in asphalt mixes (although more sophisticated models relating volumetric 
properties to mechanistic properties have been developed). The two major advancements made in 
mix design are the development and adoption of better mix compaction methods and mix evaluation 
methods in the laboratory. For structural design, the major advancements have been in terms of bet￾ter testing methods, sophisticated data analysis techniques, and feld calibration of models through 
instrumentation and accelerated loading and testing. 
12.1 PHYSICAL AND VOLUMETRIC PROPERTIES OF ASPHALT MIX 
Physical and volumetric properties are used extensively in mix design as they help us to convert 
weight to volume and vice versa, and they have been shown to have signifcant correlations with the 
performance of asphalt mixes. Correlations between volumetric properties and structural properties 
are also used in structural design when testing is not possible or actual test data are not available. 
Figure 12.1 shows a simplifed schematic of a compacted asphalt mix (i.e., what we fnd in pave￾ments). It consists of three primary components—the aggregate, the asphalt binder, and some air 
voids. Before the asphalt is added to the aggregates, there are only aggregates and some voids within 
the aggregate structure. Part of the total voids is flled with asphalt binder and the rest remains as air 
voids. Of the asphalt binder, part of it is absorbed by the aggregate and part remains as an effective 
asphalt binder on the aggregate surface. The relative proportions of the volume of the air voids with 
respect to the total volume and with respect to the volume of the total voids, and the relative propor￾tion of the volume of the effective asphalt binder with respect to the volumes of the total voids, are 
important volumetric parameters—those that have been shown to have signifcant effects on the 
performance of the asphalt mix. In addition, the proportion of mass of the effective asphalt with 
respect to the total mass is also important because it tells us how much of the asphalt binder that 
we add to the aggregates is actually effective in providing all the good properties that the asphalt 
binder is supposed to provide. 
The different parameters discussed earlier can be separated into the following (as explained in 
Figure 12.1). 
Voids in total mix (VTM): Total volume of pockets of air in between the asphalt-coated aggre￾gates in a compacted asphalt mix, expressed as a percentage of the total volume of the 
mix. Neither a high nor a very low VTM is desirable in a compacted asphalt mix—a VTM 
of 3–5 is the optimum range for adequate stability and durability. 
Absorbed asphalt (Pba): The mass of asphalt binder that is absorbed by the aggregates, 
expressed as a percentage of the mass of the aggregate. There is no specifc limit on absorp￾tion except the fact that highly absorptive aggregates (> 2% absorption) may not be used for

economical reasons (would need a relatively high amount of asphalt binder). However, if 
aggregates with relatively high absorption are used, the “aging” process during mix design 
in the laboratory needs to be modifed to accurately simulate the expected high absorption 
during production in the plant. 
Effective asphalt (Pbe): The mass of the asphalt binder that is not absorbed by the aggregate 
(total-absorbed), expressed as a percentage of the mass of the total mass of the mix. 
Voids in mineral aggregate (VMA): Total volume of the void spaces in between the aggregates 
in a compacted asphalt mix, part of which is flled with effective asphalt binder and part 
with air, expressed as a percentage of the total volume of the mix. Generally, a minimum 
VMA is desirable to provide space for adequate asphalt binder for durability and air voids 
for stability; although a very high VMA would lead to unstable mixes as well. Generally, for 
surface and base course paving mixes, the specifed minimum VMA values range from 12 
to 16, depending on the nominal maximum aggregate size (NMAS) of the mix—the higher 
the NMAS, the lower the minimum VMA. This is based on the principle that a gradation 
ISTUDYMix and Structural Design of Asphalt Mix Layers 347 
with a higher NMAS has a relatively lower surface area (of aggregates) and would require a 
relatively lower amount of asphalt to provide an optimum flm thickness of asphalt binder.
Voids flled with asphalt (VFA): The part of the total void spaces in between the aggregates in 
a compacted mix that is flled with asphalt binder, expressed as a percentage. A low VFA 
indicates an inadequate amount of asphalt binder or too high VTM, which are undesirable 
for durability; a high value indicates a relatively low VTM, which can cause stability prob￾lems. A range, generally 65–80, is specifed on the basis of traffc levels—a higher volume 
of traffc would need a mix with lower asphalt content for stability and a lower VFA. Note 
that the volumetric properties need the determination of density or specifc gravity. 
Next consider Figure 12.2, in addition to Figure 12.1. They show defnitions of the different parame￾ters discussed earlier, in equations, and point out the properties that we need from tests to determine 
these volumetric properties. These are listed next.

12.1.1 BULK-SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF COMPACTED ASPHALT MIX (GMB) 
This test determines the ratio of weight in air of a compacted asphalt mix specimen at a certain 
temperature to the weight of an equal volume of water at the same temperature. For dense graded 
asphalt paving mixes, the test can be run according to AASHTO T 166 (Bulk-Specifc Gravity of 
Compacted Hot Mix Asphalt Using Saturated Surface Dry Specimens). The test consists of measur￾ing the weight of the sample in air and in water (after immersing for 3–5min) and then measuring 
the saturated surface dry (SSD) weight (after patting the surface dry). The bulk-specifc gravity is 
determined from the following formula. 
A G ˜ 12.1 mb B C°
where 
A is the weight in grams of the specimen in air 
B is the weight in grams of the saturated surface dry specimen in air 
C is the weight in grams of the specimen in water 
The bulk-specifc gravity is multiplied by the density of water to obtain bulk density 
Specimens that contain open or interconnected voids or absorb more than 2% water (or both) 
can be tested by using either ASTM D 1188 (Bulk-Specifc Gravity and Density of Compacted 
Bituminous Mixtures Using Coated Samples) or AASHTO TP 69 (Bulk-Specifc Gravity and 
Density of Compacted Asphalt Mixtures Using Automatic Vacuum Sealing Method). Note that 
for testing of feld cores that have been obtained by sawing or coring and that contain a signifcant 
amount of water, the procedure is the same except that the dry mass (mass in grams of the speci￾men in air) is obtained last after drying the specimen at 110°C to constant mass. 
12.1.2 THEORETICAL MAXIMUM DENSITY OR MAXIMUM SPECIFIC 
GRAVITY OF THE MIX (GMM)/RICE SPECIFIC GRAVITY 
This test determines the ratio of weight of a unit volume of an uncompacted asphalt mix sam￾ple to the weight of an equal volume of water at the same temperature. This test can be run 
according to ASTM D 2041 (Theoretical Maximum Specifc Gravity and Density of Bituminous 
Paving Mixtures) or AASHTO T 209 (Theoretical Maximum Specifc Gravity and Density of 
Hot-Mix Asphalt Paving Mixtures). A specifed amount of mix (ranging in weight from 1.1 to 
5.5 lb for a range of maximum size of aggregate of #4-1 in.) is warmed in an oven and taken 
out, and the particles are separated from each other. The mix is weighed in air, and then placed 
in a pycnometer with suffcient water to cover it. A vacuum pump is then connected to the pyc￾nometer and turned on to remove entrapped air from the mix. The mix is agitated during this 
procedure to help remove the air. At the end of this step, the pycnometer is submerged in a water 
bath, and its weight (along with the mix inside it) is noted. The following expression is used for 
the calculation of Gmm.

The following equation can be used to compute an average specific gravity of a 
blend of aggregates consisting of different seize fractions:
1 G = 
P1 + P2 – Pn 
100G1 100G2 100Gn 
where 
G is the average specifc gravity 
G1, G2, ...,Gn is the appropriate specifc gravity of each size fraction 
P1, P2, ...,Pn is the percentage (by mass) of each fraction in the total sample 
Note that there is a check for making sure that porous aggregates without an adequate amount of 
asphalt binder cover are not getting saturated with water during the vacuum procedure. 
The different specifc gravities of aggregates and asphalt binder have been discussed in Chapter 8 
and Chapter 9, respectively. The importance of the three specifc gravities of aggregate is discussed 
in the following paragraphs. 
The need for the determination of the different specifc gravities of aggregate arises from the fact 
that all aggregates absorb water (and hence asphalt as well) to some extent. Determination of the 
different specifc gravities allows the estimation of such absorbed water, and then the estimation of 
absorbed asphalt. Whatever the specifc gravity might be, the testing procedure always has the basic 
fundamental objective of determination of weight (or, more precisely, mass) divided by volume. 
The weight is either dry (for Gsb) or saturated surface dry (for Gsb-SSD), and the volume is (volume of 
aggregate + surface voids) for Gsb, and volume of aggregate only for apparent specifc gravity (Gsa; 
Figure 12.3). Using Gsb and Gsa, as shown in Figure 12.2, one can determine the absorption. 
Note that when the specifc gravities of different size fractions are used (for a blend of aggre￾gates), the average specifc gravity value of the blend needs to be calculated and used in the deter￾mination of the volumetric properties of the mix. The procedure is explained in Figure 12.3. 
The concept of effective specifc gravity arises in an asphalt-coated aggregate. In this case, for 
the mass divided by volume parameter, the mass is still the dry aggregate, but the volume consists 
of the volume of the aggregate plus the volume of the surface voids that are not flled with asphalt. 
This defnition is important since the “effective” aggregate volume is used to calculate the absorbed 
asphalt and hence the effective asphalt binder content. Effective specifc gravity is a calculated 
parameter, from Gmm, as shown in Figure 12.2.

12.2 MIX DESIGN METHODS 
In the following paragraphs, three different mix design systems are presented. Note that all of the 
mix design systems have the same objectives of selecting the most desirable aggregates and asphalts 
and combining them in the most appropriate ratio to obtain the optimum volumetric properties. 
12.2.1 HVEEM METHOD (ASTM D 1560, D 1561) 
The Hveem method was developed by Francis Hveem of the California Division of Highways in the 
1920s. It is intended for mixes with a maximum aggregate size of 1in. and has been used primarily 
for the design of dense graded mixes. 
The primary steps in this procedure are the following: 
1. Select suitable aggregates, gradation, and asphalt binder for the project. 
2. Determine the approximate asphalt (binder) content as a percentage of dry aggregate using 
the centrifuge kerosene equivalent (CKE) test procedure and aggregate gradation. 
3. Prepare specimens, 2.5in. high and 4in. in diameter, for a range of asphalt contents at, 
below, and above the estimated asphalt content from Step 1, using a kneading compactor, 
at recommended temperatures (for specifc asphalt grades). 
4. Test using a stabilometer and a swell test apparatus. 
5. Compute stabilometer value, swell, density, and air voids (using maximum specifc gravity).

3. Determine Kf from Chart 1, and Kc from Chart 2 
4. Determine the correction to Kf using Chart 3 
5. Calculate K as: K = Kf+ correction (correction is negative if k – kf m m ) is negative, otherwise positive c 
6. Determine the oil ratio for a cutback asphalt from Chart 4 
7. Determine oil ratio for the paving grade asphalt binder from Chart 5 and compute asphalt content as follows: 
Oil ratio Asphalt content = 100 * 100 + Oil ratio 
8. Mix asphalt and aggregates using mixing temperature as follows:

AC-20, AR 8,000, or 60–70 Pen 300–325 
AC-40, AR 16,000, or 40–50 Pen 300–325 
Prepare 4 specimens - One at asphalt content determined in Step 7, 2 at 0.5% increments above, and one at 0.5% 
increment below - for stabilometer test; 2 at asphalt content determined in Step 7 for swell test 
6. Determine the optimum asphalt content by selecting the maximum asphalt content that 
meets the minimum air voids and stabilometer value criteria. The other criteria that must 
be met are those for maximum swell and observed fushing of asphalt. 
The key steps are illustrated in Figure 12.5 with the relevant charts in Figure 12.6. A kneading 
compactor is shown in Figure 12.7. The criteria are shown in Table 12.1.

12.2.2 MARSHALL METHOD 
The Marshall method was developed by Bruce Marshall of the Mississippi Highway Department in 
the 1930s and was refned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 1940s and 1950s. Although 
intended for use of mixes with a maximum aggregate size of 1 in., the procedure has since been 
modifed to accommodate large-size aggregates (up to 1 1/2 in.). This method continues to be used 
widely in airport pavement design jobs and has been used for designing asphalt emulsion mixes, as 
well as for compaction and testing of quality control samples during construction. 
Following are the main steps in this method. 
1. Select aggregates using available test methods and gradation, considering VMA; select 
appropriate viscosity-grade asphalt, conduct viscosity tests at different temperatures, and 
determine mixing and compaction temperature from temperature versus viscosity data. 
ISTUDYMix and Structural Design of Asphalt Mix Layers 357 
1. Conduct viscosity tests at different temperatures and plot viscosity versus temperature; 
select mixing temperature corresponding to 170 + 20 cSt 
select compaction temperature corresponding to 280 + 30 cSt 
2. Mix 18 specimens - six at each of three asphalt contenst, optimum (from guidelines), 
0.5% above optimum, 0.5% below optimum 
3. Compact specimens using a marshall hammer, with numbers of blows as shown in the table in Figure 12.9, 
after curing mix, if required 
4. Determine bulk specifc gravity and compute VTM, VMA and VFA 
5. Test specimens for stability and fow using the marshall stability-fow equipment 
6. Plot asphalt content versus unit weight, VMA, stability, VFA, fow and VTM, as shown in Figure 12.9 
7. Select the optimum asphalt content on the basis of criteria for specifc method used; National 
Asphalt Pavement Association (NAPA) and Asphalt Institute (AI) guidelines are provided below 
NAPA procedure 
Select the asphalt content of the mix with the VTM equal
 to the median VTM in specifcation (for example, 4%) as 
the optimum asphalt content 
Determine stability, fow, VMA and VFA at the optimum 
asphalt content and check to ensure compliance against 
criteria 
If any one of the criteria is not met, redesign the mix 
AI procedure 
Determine 
Asphalt content at mid-point of Asphalt content at maximum stability Asphalt content at maximum density allowable range of VTM 
Determine the average of these three asphalt contents 
Determine stability, fow, VTM, VMA and VFA at the 
optimum asphalt content from the plots and check to 
ensure compliance against criteria 
If any one of the criteria is not met, redesign the mix 
Note: Change aggregate gradation and redesign the mix if VMA criterion is not met 
2. Prepare specimens using a Marshall compactor (handheld or mechanical) with an appro￾priate number of blows per side (considering the traffc level of the project) at the mixing 
and compaction temperature determined in Step 1. 
3. Determine bulk-specifc gravity. 
4. Condition the specimens and run a Marshall stability and fow test. 
5. Compute VTM, VMA, and VFA using maximum specifc gravity of the mix and specifc 
gravity of aggregates, and stability and fow from test data obtained in Steps 3 and 4. 
6. Determine the optimum asphalt content using criteria from the appropriate method, on the 
basis of VTM, VMA, VFA, stability, and fow values for the expected traffc level in the 
project. 
The method is explained in Figure 12.8, with the relevant charts and criteria in Figure 12.9. The 
fabrication of a Marshall specimen consists of placing a specifed amount of mix in a mold assembly

height of 18 in., which could be raised automatically by a mechanism or manually (Figure 12.10). 
The mold assembly sits on a compaction pedestal which consists of an 8 in. × 8 in. × 18in. wooden 
post capped with a 12 in.× 12 in.× 1 in. steel plate. The post is secured to a concrete foor by brack￾ets, and the cap should be level. The mold assembly and compaction hammer face are heated to 
300°F before compaction. The mix is transferred carefully inside the mold, with the collar on top 
of it, and spaded vigorously around the perimeter and at the center. After a paper disk is put on top 
of the smoothed surface of the mix in the mold, the mold assembly is transferred to the pedestal, 
and compaction starts when the temperature of the mix reaches a temperature at which the asphalt 
binder has a specifed viscosity, for example, 280 ± 30 Cs. Each side of the specimen is compacted 
by the specifed number of blows, the paper disks are peeled off the surface, and the specimen is left 
to cool down to a temperature that can be handled easily, after which the specimen is extruded out 
of the mold with an extruder.
 The procedure for checking the stability and fow starts with conditioning the specimen in 
a 140°F water bath for 30–40 min. Testing is conducted using a stability and fow tester (Figure 
12.11) at a temperature of 70°F–100°F. The peak load at which the sample breaks and the fow are 
recorded. Stability correlation ratios are provided in AASHTO T 245 to adjust the values of the 
stability if a specimen with height different from 2 1/2 in. is used.

recommendation form blending chart (M323) if RAP% > 25; If percent binder 
replacement is specified, percent binder replacement is determined by the ratio of 
reclaimed binder to the total binder in the mix; evaluate mixes (M323) on a geographical 
or project by project basis to determine maximum RAP% or minimum % of virgin binder. 
3. Select aggregate nominal maximum aggregate size (M323, NAPA IS128). 
4. Select combined aggregate gradation (M323, T11, T27) and classify the gradation. 
5. Ensure aggregate test requirements—coarse aggregate angularity (T335), fine aggregate 
angularity (T304, Method A), sand equivalent (T176), flat and elongated particles 
(ASTM D 4791); extract RAP aggregates (T164 or T308) and include in gradation for 
evaluation of test property requirement except sand equivalent test. 
6. Compact HMA (R35) and design HMA (T312) to meet relative density, VMA, VFA, and 
dust to binder ratio requirements (see Table 14.2). 
7. Compact samples at design binder content (T312) and test (T283) to ensure minimum 
tensile strength ratio.

12.2.3 SUPERPAVE METHOD 
The Superpave (Superior Performing Pavement) method was developed as a result of the Strategic 
Highway Research Program (SHRP) research effort in the United States during the late 1980s and 
early 1990s. The system includes the newly developed performance-graded (PG) asphalt binder 
classifcation system, aggregate properties identifed as “consensus” properties, new mix compac￾tion, and mix analysis procedures. The key steps (AASHTO R 35-15) in the mix design method are 
the following: 
1. Select aggregates, binder, and RAP material that meet environmental and traffc requirements. 
2. Determine the bulk-specifc gravity of the proposed blend of aggregates and the binder. 
3. For RAP, assume asphalt absorption, determine Gmm, and using both calculate the bulk￾specifc gravity; the Gse of the RAP could be used instead of the Gsb, if permitted by the 
agency, in which case an adjustment to the specifed VMA may be needed to account for 
the error in assuming Gse = Gsb. 
4. Prepare at least three trial blends form the selected aggregate stockpiles unless a design b 
lend is available from previous experience. 
5. Estimate the initial trial binder content for each blend. 
6. Prepare at least two specimens for each blend at estimated binder content using T312. 
7. Check the specimens for V , VMA, VFS, dust-to-binder ratio at Ndesign and relative density a 
at Ninitial, using AASHTO M 232 and select a design aggregate structure. 
8. For the selected blend prepare specimens at the estimated design binder content and at ± 
0.5% and ± 1.0%. 
9. Select the design binder content on the basis of Va, VMA, VFA, dust-to-binder ratio 
at Ndesign, and relative density at Ninitial and Nmax from AASHTO M 323. 
10. Oven condition mix according to AASHTO R 30, Section 7.1 and compact specimens to 
7.0 ± 0.5% air voids according to AASHTO T 312. 
11. Group the specimens, run moisture condition test, and evaluate moisture susceptibility 
according to AASHTO T 283 to ensure meeting tensile strength ratio requirement of 
AASHTO M 323. 
The method is illustrated in Figure 12.12, with the relevant plots and criteria in Figure 12.13 and 
Table 12.2, respectively.

2. Entering the plot of percent air voids versus percent binder content at 4.0% air voids, the design binder content is detetmined

3. Entering the plots of percent VMA versus percent binder content and percent VFA versus percent binder content at 5.7%
 binder content, the mix meets the VMA and VFA requirements.

AASHTO 312 specifes the method for using a Superpave gyratory compactor for compaction 
of 150 mm diameter HMA specimens for subsequent determination of bulk-specifc gravity. The 
equipment consists of a loading system within a frame, which applies a specifed load for compac￾tion of the mix in a mold, which sits between the loading ram and a rotating base. The loading ram 
applies a stress of 600kPa, and the base rotates with a tilt of 1.25° (Figure 12.14), for a specifed 
number of gyrations (depending on the level of compaction, which is dependent on the design traffc 
as well as high temperature), at 30 gyrations per minute. The fnal height is approximately 115mm, 
and during compaction the height is continuously measured to 0.1 mm. 
Generally mix in the amount of approximately 5000g is obtained following the AASHTO 
specifed quartering procedure from fresh samples and is used for compaction. The mix should

be compacted at a temperature at which the asphalt binder in the mix possesses a viscosity of 
0.28± 0.03 Pa s. The mix is transferred to the preheated (to compaction temperature) steel mold 
(150 mm high with an inside diameter of 150 mm) with a base plate. Protective paper disks must be 
placed at the bottom of the mold before placing the mix, and at the top of the mix before placing it 
inside the gyratory compactor. The number of gyrations is then set, and the compaction started. The 
number of compactions could be set at N or Ndesign max , depending on the agency-specifc require￾ments. The number of gyrations versus specimen height data is generally stored to a disk via the 
equipment computer and/or printed out at the end of the compaction process. The specimen is then 
extruded out of the mold, and the paper discs are removed as quickly as possible. The specimens are 
left to cool down for subsequent tests. 
The height data at the fnal compaction are used to estimate the volume of the sample, and hence 
the bulk-specifc gravity, which is then corrected on the basis of the actual bulk-specifc gravity, 
which is determined by testing of the specimen. The correction factor is then used to determine the 
corrected bulk-specifc gravities at all gyrations. The corrected bulk-specifc gravity can be used 
along with the TMD or maximum Rice gravity (Gmm) to calculate the air voids. The densities at 
Ninitial, Ndesign, and N are of primary importance, and the determined values are checked against max 
specifed values for compliance with mix design. The data can also be used for calculation and 
checking of voids in mineral aggregates (VMA) and voids flled with asphalt (VFA). 
A test for resistance against moisture damage (AASHTO T 283) is then conducted on samples 
compacted with the optimum asphalt content. In this test, the resistance to moisture damage is 
evaluated by measuring the tensile strength of a dry set of HMA samples and another set of wet/

conditioned samples and comparing the two. The tensile strength ratio (strength of conditioned 
specimens divided by the strength of the unconditioned/dry specimens) is checked against a speci￾fed minimum limit (such as 80%). Note that a low average tensile strength of conditioned samples, 
when compared against a low average strength of unconditioned samples, can give a high tensile 
strength ratio and make the mix meet the specifcations; to prevent against such misleading conclu￾sions, it is advisable to specify a minimum average strength of conditioned samples as well (such as 
60 psi, 414kPa). The conditioning phase is supposed to simulate the destructive action of moisture/ 
freezing/thawing, through which bonds inside the specimen are destroyed, and the tensile strength 
is lowered. This conditioning can be simply soaking and drying, or it can be freezing or thawing, 
depending on the environmental conditions that are expected in the location of the pavement being 
constructed. Specimens used in this test are compacted after conditioning the mix for 16 h in an 
oven at 60°C. The mix is compacted at the specifed compaction temperature such that the resulting 
specimens have 7%± 1% air voids. These specimens need to be stored for 72–96h at room tempera￾ture before the next step. 
FIGURE 12.14 Compaction using the Superpave gyratory compactor. 
ISTUDY364 Pavement Engineering 
Based on the air voids (determined from bulk-specifc gravity and maximum specifc gravity, 
which are measured from an additional sample), the specimens are divided into two groups (each 
group with three samples) such that the average air voids of the two groups are approximately the 
same. Thickness and diameter measurements are made. The dry subset samples are placed inside a 
water bath maintained at 25°C after placing them in leak-proof plastic bags. After 2 h, the samples 
are removed from the bags and tested for their tensile strength. Load is applied at a rate of 50 mm/ 
min. The peak load is recorded and is used along with the diameter and the thickness of the sample 
to calculate the tensile strength. The wet subset samples are vacuum saturated to at least 55%–80% 
of saturation (which should be checked by measuring the SSD weight), after which they are covered 
with plastic wrap and placed in a plastic bag with 10mL of water inside the bag. The bag is then 
placed inside a freezer at −18°C for 16h, after which the specimen is placed in a 60°C water bath for 
24h. Then the specimen is conditioned at 25°C water and then tested for tensile strength. 
After breaking, the aggregates inside the sample could be examined to determine the degree 
of stripping or loss of asphalt, if any. Some agencies (such as the Georgia DOT) specify a method 
of evaluating the degree of stripping by this method. Note that one freezing and thawing cycle is 
described earlier—agencies could also require multiple freeze-thaw tests, depending on the sever￾ity of the environment in which the pavement is expected to serve. Figure 12.15 shows a typical 
agency job mix formula resulting from a mix design. In more and more cases, designed mixes are 
being “proof” tested for such properties as resistance against rutting and/or moisture effects, or they 
are compared between each other with the help of simulative tests. The asphalt pavement analyzer 
(APA), shown in Figure 12.16, is such a test procedure, in which gyratory-compacted samples can 
be subjected to a pressure of 100 psi and a load of 100 lb in a temperature-controlled chamber with 
or without moisture (AASHTO T 340-10). The steel wheels apply the load through pressurized 
rubber hoses, and the deformation in the HMA samples after a specifc number of “passes” of the 
wheels is used as the indicator of strength against rutting. Another popular “proof testing” equip￾ment is the Hamburg Wheel Tracker (also shown in Figure 12.16), which uses a loaded steel wheel 
on samples (either slabs or gyratory compacted) submerged in the water (AASHTO T 324-16). The 
two parts of the plot that relate rutting to the number of wheels passes are utilized to determine a 
stripping infection point and the contribution of moisture damage toward the total deformation. 
The equipment is being widely used in the United States to evaluate moisture susceptibility of HMA 
and the effectiveness of anti-strip agents. 
The Moisture Induced Stress Tester (MIST, shown in Figure 12.16) which applies water pressure 
cyclically for a desired amount of time, pressure, and water temperature (ASTM D 7870) is also 
being increasingly used for the evaluation of moisture susceptibility of asphalt mixes. 
12.2.3.1 Mix Design Systems of South Africa, France, the United Kingdom, and Australia 
A harmonized European system of mix design has been introduced by the European Committee for 
Normalization, or Comité Européen de Normalisation [CEN], and readers are encouraged to view 
CEN pages at www.cen.eu/cen/pages/default.aspx. 
The South African mix design system is based on the conventional Marshall mix design system 
and also includes performance simulative tests such as indirect tensile strength, dynamic creep, static 
creep, and immersion index. New test methods have been added, such as rutting tests with the model 
mobile load simulator (MMLS3), especially for slow moving heavy loads. Field trials are also men￾tioned to ensure the applicability of the mixing and the compaction procedure. The design consider￾ation consists of preventing rutting, fatigue damage, excessive permeability, moisture susceptibility, 
noise, and skidding and ensuring constructability. These considerations are ranked in order to deter￾mine the specifc performance tests that need to be carried out. Before conducting the performance 
tests, however, the gradation and the target binder content are selected, and a volumetric analysis is 
conducted to fnalize the binder content. The selection of the specifc gradation is based on the con￾sideration of either of the two mechanisms—substitution or flling. For substitution the space flled 
by the fne aggregates is replaced by an increase in the coarse aggregate fraction whereas in flling,

FIGURE 12.15 Results of a mix design in a standard format (Job Mix Formula). 
(Courtesy of Rick Bradbury, Maine Department of Transportation, Augusta, ME.) 
the space between the coarse aggregate is flled by an increase in the fne aggregate concentration. 
The selection of one mechanism over the other depends on the priority given to the different design 
objectives, such as ensuring stability or durability and compactability. The various performance tests 
and criteria may consist of dry and wet rutting under MMLS3, CSIR wheel tracking test, gyratory 
refusal density (air voids at 300 gyrations of the Superpave gyratory compactor), gyrations to 93%

of feld density, dynamic creep test (stiffness at a specifc temperature), strain in four point bending 
beam fatigue test, indirect tensile strength, modifed Lottman test, Marshall stability, and fow and 
fller to asphalt binder ratio. A viscosity graded binder system is used. 
The French mix design system consists of four different levels, from 1 to 4, with increasing 
number of tests. The asphalt binder tests are penetration and ring and ball temperature, as well as 
ISTUDYMix and Structural Design of Asphalt Mix Layers 367 
RTFOT loss, and the asphalt content is based on a minimum content (richness factor) that is similar 
to the flm thickness concept. The feld compactability of the mix is checked by the determina￾tion of air voids after a specifc number of gyrations in a gyratory shear compactor, whereas the 
moisture sensitivity is evaluated with the Duriez (resistance to unconfned compression for dry and 
water conditioned samples) test. For higher level mixes, the rutting potential is evaluated with the 
wheel tracking test, whereas the modulus and the fatigue properties are estimated from the complex 
modulus (or uniaxial tensile) test, and the two point bending tests, respectively. A slab compactor 
with infated tires is used for preparation of samples for all of the tests. The rutting test is conducted 
with the LCPC wheel tracking rut tester, which consists of a pneumatic tire infated to 600 kPa and 
a vertical load of 5 kN. A two-point bending test with a trapezoidal shaped HMA sample is utilized 
for the complex modulus test at a set of frequencies and temperature and a master curve is produced. 
Alternatively, the uniaxial direct tensile test at a constant strain is conducted on a cylindrical speci￾men at a range of temperatures and frequencies. The two-point bending test is conducted for fatigue 
tests with trapezoidal shaped samples at different strain levels at 10°C and 25 Hz, and the fatigue 
curves for strain versus number of load cycles to failure are constructed. The fatigue and modulus 
tests are conducted for Levels 3 and 4 for which the structural design properties are required. 
The British mix design system uses a penetration graded asphalt binder, and the Marshall ham￾mer is utilized for preparation of samples from which the volumetric and Marshall mix design 
properties (stability and fow) are determined. Compaction to refusal is also utilized with either a 
Marshall hammer or with an electric vibrating hammer. The mix stiffness modulus is determined 
with the British Nottingham Asphalt Tester at 20°C. A repeated load axial test could be conducted 
to determine the resultant strain and creep stiffness modulus at a temperature of 30°C. A wheel 
tracking test is conducted for the evaluation of rutting potential, with either cylindrical or slab 
samples, at 45°C (moderate to heavily stressed) or 60°C (very heavily stressed) to check against a 
maximum allowable rut depth. 
The Australian mix design system has three levels, 1 through 3, with increasing number of tests. 
The mix is compacted with a gyratory compactor, and the asphalt content is determined from the 
criteria of volumetric properties. For heavy traffcked pavements, wheel tracking and refusal density 
tests are performed, with options of additional test, such as those for fatigue and moisture sensitiv￾ity. Resilient modulus and dynamic creep properties are determined for heavy traffcked pavements 
(or slow traffc pavements). A wheel tracking test at 60°C is also conducted at Level 3. If fatigue 
properties are required, tests are conducted with third point loading of beams at constant strain at 
20°C. In the refusal density test, the density of sample compacted to 350 cycles in a gyratory com￾pactor is determined, and the air voids are calculated and checked against a minimum allowable 
(3%) to prevent rutting. 
12.3 BALANCED MIX DESIGN (BMD) 
The Balanced Mix Design for overlays, originally developed for the Texas DOT (Zhou et al., 2007), 
aims to balance the mix components in such a way that adequate resistance against both rutting and 
cracking are obtained. The development of this method was triggered by the fact that many of the 
dense graded overlay HMA mixes were meeting the rutting criteria, as obtained from the Hamburg 
Wheel Tracking Test (HTT) but failing in the overlay Tester (OT), which evaluates mixes for refec￾tive, as well as fatigue and low temperature, cracking. It was proposed that instead of being selected 
on the basis of the traditional 4% air voids, the asphalt content be selected from the data/plot where 
the requirements of a maximum rut depth (from HTT) and minimum cracking life, cycles, (from OT) 
are satisfed. Subsequently, a U.S. FHWA Expert task Group (ETG) defned BMD as “asphalt mix 
design using performance tests on appropriately conditioned specimens that address multiple modes 
of distress taking into consideration mix aging, traffc, climate and location within the pavement 
structure,” and a BMD framework, in AASHTO specifcation format (see AASHTO PP 105-20) was 
developed as part of NCHRP 20-07/Task 406 research work (West et al., 2018). In the current BMD, 
ISTUDY368 Pavement Engineering 
four alternative approaches are specifed, as shown in Table 12.3. The approaches (from A through 
D) progressively deviate from a primarily volumetric properties based design (with checking whether 
the performance meets the criteria) to a primarily performance property based design. 
The tests that are included in the BMD are shown in Table 12.4. 
TABLE 12.3 
Four Approaches for BMD 
Approach A: Volumetric design with performance verifcation; designed according to AASHTO R 35, and meets additional 
performance test criteria. 
Approach B: Volumetric design with performance optimization: designed according to AASHTO R 35, and asphalt content 
adjusted within ± 0.5% to meet target performance criteria. 
Approach C: Performance modifed volumetric design: designed according to AASHTO R 35, but both gradation and 
asphalt content can be adjusted to meet performance criteria, even without meeting all Superpave volumetric criteria. 
Approach D: Performance design: the mix is designed completely on the basis of performance analysis, with minimal 
requirements for asphalt and aggregate properties, but none on volumetric properties.

(Courtesy of InstroTek, Inc.) 
In support of BMD, two tests, which can also be used for quality control (Zhou et al., 2020), have 
been developed which deserve attention: the IDEAL-CT (Zhou et al., 2017) and the IDEAL-RT test 
for the evaluation of cracking and rutting susceptibility, respectively. These tests are desirable because 
they are fast, can be conducted with relatively cheap equipment, and the sample preparation process is 
fast and simple. Furthermore, results from these tests have shown excellent correlations with effective 
but much more complex/time-consuming tests, such as the Semi-Circular Bending (SCB) tests, the 
Asphalt Pavement Analyzer (APA), and the HWTT tests. Both of these tests can be conducted on the 
same loading frame (similar to a Marshall testing frame, Figure 12.17), however, the sample holders 
for the two tests (cracking and rutting) are different. For the rutting test, the setup is such that the shear 
ISTUDY 
370 Pavement Engineering 
stresses are generated (support on two sides of the cylindrical specimen at the bottom), while for the 
cracking test, the setup is suitable for generating tensile stresses (one support at the bottom). 
12.4 STRUCTURAL DESIGN 
The basic methods of consideration of the major distresses have been discussed in Chapter 11. 
Recall that some of the models are based on statistical regression with empirical data, whereas oth￾ers are based on mechanics. In an empirical structural design method, only empirical models are 
used, whereas in a mechanistic-empirical method, both empirical and mechanistic expressions are 
utilized. The following paragraphs present examples of both types of design method. 
12.4.1 EMPIRICAL METHODS 
The empirical methods include mostly those based on the soil classifcation system and subgrade 
type (U.S. Bureau of Public Roads) and those based on road tests conducted by AASHO. In both 
cases the design methods are based on experience—either from in-service pavements or from 
controlled experiments. The advantages of such methods are that suffcient data are available and 
design procedures are relatively simple and less time consuming. The primary disadvantage is that 
the design cannot accommodate traffc, environmental conditions, and materials for which experi￾ence and/or results of experiments do not exist. 
12.4.1.1 California Bearing Ratio Method 
This method is based on charts relating the required thickness of pavement over the subgrade to the 
strength of the subgrade—the strength being represented in terms of a parameter called the California 
Bearing Ratio (CBR; ASTM D 1883-99, AASHTO T 193). The CBR concept and test method were 
originally developed by the California Division of Highways in the 1920s, later modifed by the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers, and fnally adopted by the American Society of Testing and Materials 
(ASTM) and the American Association of Highway and Transportation Offcials (AASHTO). 
The CBR test is a penetration test that uses a standard piston (3 in.2
) which penetrates the soil at 
a standard rate of 0.05 in./min. A unit load is recorded at several penetration depths, typically 0.1 
and 0.2in. The CBR value is computed by dividing the recorded unit load by a standard load that 
is required for penetration for a high-quality crushed stone material. The CBR test is conducted on 
a soaked sample of soil—soaking in water (for 96 h) is conducted to simulate the worst (saturated) 
condition under which the pavement would perform. 
Figure 12.18 shows the original curves for CBR versus thickness for two different traffc levels, 
and an example to illustrate its use. 
12.4.1.2 American Association of State Highway and Transportation Offcials (AASHTO) Method 
The AASHTO design procedure introduced a number of important design concepts. The design 
procedure came out of statistical analysis of data from an extensive road test carried out between 
1955 and 1960 near Ottawa, Illinois. Traffc, consisting of trucks with different loads and axles, 
were run to failure over different pavement sections, consisting of different materials and thick￾ness. Two important concepts—serviceability and reliability—were utilized in the development of 
the design process (AASHTO, 1986). This design procedure has been subsequently revised to add 
more mechanistic components over the years. The latest version is the AASHTO Guide for Design 
of Pavement Structures, published in 1993 (AASHTO, 1993). 
The procedure started with the AASHO Road Test. The concept of Present Serviceability Index 
(PSI) was developed, and an equation relating traffc to thickness was developed. This equation was 
mapped into a nomograph, which is often used in this method. The tests were carried out in Ottawa, 
Illinois, between the years of 1958 and 1961. In total, there were six test tracks, with both HMA 
and reinforced concrete sections. For the test location, the mean temperatures in January and July

For average traÿc, for a subgrade

were 27°F and 76°F, respectively. The annual average rainfall and frost depth were 34 and 28 in., 
respectively. The subgrade soil consisted of A6 (silty clay), with 82% of the material passing the No. 
200 sieve, and an average CBR of 2.9 and optimum moisture content of 13%. The subbase and base 
courses consisted of a sand/gravel mixture (CBR = 28–51) and crushed limestone (average = 108), 
respectively. The HMA was made up of 85–100 penetration grade asphalt. 
There were multiple HMA sections with subbase courses varying in thickness from 0 to 16in., base 
courses 0–9in., and HMA 1–6in. The majority of the HMA sections failed, with most failing due 
to the effect of spring thaw, which was found to decrease with the use of a thicker base and subbase.

Base 10 logarithm of the predicted number of ESALs over the lifetime of the pavement. The loga￾rithm is taken based on the original empirical equation from the AASHO Road Test. 
12.4.1.2.2 Structural Number 
An abstract number expressing the structural strength of a pavement required for given combina￾tions of soil support (Mr
), total traffc (ESALs), and allowable change in serviceability over the 
pavement life (ΔPSI). 
The structural number is used to determine layer depths by using a parameter called layer coef￾fcient, such that 
where 
ai
 is the layer structural coeffcient 
Di
 is the layer depth, in. 
mi
 is the layer drainage coeffcient 
Typical values of layer coeffcients are as follows. HMA (surface layer): 0.44; base course (crushed 
stone): 0.14; stabilized base course material: 0.30–0.40; subbase (crushed stone): 0.11. Values of 
drainage coeffcients can range from 0.4 (slow-draining, saturated layers) to 1.4 (fast-draining layers 
that do not get saturated). The term can be neglected by using m = 1. An example chart relating the 
various stiffness/strength measuring for subbase materials is shown in Figure 12.19. 
FIGURE 12.19 Variation in granular subbase layer coeffcient. 
ISTUDYMix and Structural Design of Asphalt Mix Layers 373 
 
The concept of reliability is based on the assumption that the distribution of variables such as 
stress, resulting from uncontrollable factors such as loading and the environment, and strength/ 
stiffness of materials/layers, resulting from controllable factors such as variations in construction 
quality and materials, can be assumed to be of the normal distribution type. Reliability refers to the 
probability that the predicted design life will exceed the required design, or, more specifcally, the 
strength of a material will exceed the stress on the material. Two factors are considered for reliabil￾ity: ZR is the standard normal deviate 
S0 is the combined standard error of the traffc prediction and performance prediction. 
Table 12.5 shows the different values of ZR for the different levels of reliability, which could be 
selected on the basis of guidelines that have been provided in the AASHTO Design Guide. 
12.4.1.2.3 S0 
The typical values for a fexible pavement are 0.40–0.50. S0 cannot be calculated from actual traffc 
or construction numbers, so it is almost always assumed to be 0.50. 
12.4.1.2.4 Solution of the AASHTO Equation 
The equation is solved using an iterative process. The equation is often solved assuming ESAL 
values. The process consists of the following steps: 
1. Determine the total ESALs. 
2. Determine Mr
, or, using the following formula, convert existing CBR values to Mr
. 
AASHTO method: Mr
, psi = 1500*(CBR) 
NCHRP 1–37 method: Mr
, psi = 2555(CBR)0.64 
3. Select reliability (selecting a reliability means selecting a specifc value of ZR). 
4. Select po, pt
. 
5. Decide on a basic structure and select the Mr
 of the materials of the layers. 
6. Solve the equation for two layers (e.g., combine lower two layers and upper two layers); 
solve each layer using the Mr
 of the layer directly underneath. 
7. Determine total SN; SN required from lower two layers (combined) and from upper two 
layers. 
8. Use guidelines and experience to select thickness of the different layers to satisfy the SN 
requirement.

The AASHTO standard guide for design of pavement provides relationships between the resilient 
modulus and layer coeffcients, whereas the relationship between the CBR and resilient modulus is 
provided by the U.K. Transportation Research Laboratories (TRL). The relationships are as follows:

12.4.2 MECHANISTIC-EMPIRICAL METHODS 
A typical mechanistic-empirical design procedure basically consists of two parts—a mechanis￾tic part or an analytical part which helps in the determination of pavement response under load, 
and an empirical part that relates the response to pavement performance or (more specifcally) to 
distress, such as rutting. The complete fow chart for a mechanistic-empirical design is shown in

FIGURE 12.21 Flowchart in a typical mechanistic-empirical design.
A typical schematic of a layered pavement structure with material properties relevant for ME 
design is shown in Figure 12.22. The layers are shown with typical values for a specific location. 
The layer thicknesses as well as the material properties are then changed within reasonable ranges. 
The effects of these changes on a critical response, the tensile strain at the bottom of the HMA sur￾face layer, are also shown in Figure 12.22.
Once the critical responses are determined, they are used in relationships between such 
responses and critical performance conditions or distresses to predict the number of load repetitions 
that the pavement can sustain before reaching the threshold/critical values of the distress conditions. 
Alternatively, if the number of load repetitions is given for a specific design period, the cumulative 
“damage” to the pavement for the given number of load repetitions is determined. This cumulative 
“damage” is then checked against the appropriate criteria, and if found unsuitable, the layer thick￾nesses and/or material properties are changed, and the process is repeated until an acceptable “dam￾age” is obtained—and this represents the end of the “structural design” step.
In the design methods, the damage from each group of traffic (for each season) is consid￾ered, and the damage factor for the ith loading is defined as the number of repetitions (Nactual)

of a given response parameter divided by the “allowable” repetitions (Nallowable) of the response 
parameter that would cause failure. The cumulative damage factor (CDF) is obtained by sum￾ming the damage factors over all the loadings in the traffc spectrum. If the CDF reaches 1.0, 
then the pavement is presumed to have reached the end of its design life. Hence, the objective of 
the design process is to change the different factors until the computed CDF is found to be close 
to, but less than, 1.0. 
A simple application of the two steps is illustrated in the following example.

Since the CDFs are both less than 1, the pavement is suffciently strong to withstand the 
expected design traffc. In fact, since the CDFs are very low compared to the limiting value of 
1, there is scope for redesigning the pavement for the design traffc. 
Note that in this case fatigue cracking and rutting and relatively simple models relating 
tensile strains and compressive strains to them (respectively) have been used. A design could 
involve more sophisticated models and/or other distresses such as thermal cracking, as dis￾cussed in Chapter 11. 
12.4.2.1 Design of Low Volume Roads 
Low volume roads are important as they serve many critical “lifelines” of transportation such as 
those need for transporting crops from the agricultural felds or materials that are mined or quarried 
and brought to cities or work sites. Examples include farm to market roads as well as heavy haul 
roads that are used by trucks carrying forest products or products from oil and gas industries. Note 
ISTUDYMix and Structural Design of Asphalt Mix Layers 379 
that there are roads which are used by both kinds of vehicles—heavy and light, such as those with 
haul-trucks and employee cars for a specifc mining area. Low volume roads are defned by differ￾ent agencies as roads with ADT of 200–400 vehicles or less. The Low Volume Roads information 
resource center for Transportation Research Board’s (TRB’s) is at www.trb.org/AFB30/AFB30.aspx. 
The following equation (Douglas, 2016; Hoque and Jameson, 2006) has been proposed by 
Austroads for the determination of the thickness of a low volume road with high quality crushed 
aggregate base over the subgrade and a thin, non-structural asphalt mix layer.

]log14Vt 
t = granular base layer thickness (mm), minimum 100 mm 
CBR = CBR of subgrade 
Vt
 = traffc volume (ESAL) 
Design based on critical strain has been proposed for roads with very heavy loads (such as those 
from haul trucks used in the mining industries). The method consists of the determination of the 
critical vertical strain (anywhere in the pavement structure) on the basis of number of passes of the 
design axle, the use of the load, resilient modulus of layers and assumed thicknesses of the layers 
and layered elastic analysis or fnite element analysis to compute the maximum strain, and the 
checking of this computed strain to the critical strain. The analysis is repeated until the computed 
strain is lower than the maximum allowable critical strain. The following equation can be utilized 
for calculating the critical strain (εcritical, often considered to be 1500–2000 uε), where N is the num￾ber of passes of the design axle load.

12.4.2.2 Example of Structural Design Procedure Using Mechanistic Principles 
The Asphalt Institute (AI) procedure (Asphalt Institute, 1991) contains multilayer elastic theory; is 
built on the basis of data from the AASHTO Road Test, the Western Association of State Highway 
Organizations (WASHO) Road Test, and other different state and local road tests; and considers 
rutting and fatigue cracking as the distresses. For rutting the vertical compressive strain (εc) at the 
top of the subgrade is considered, whereas for fatigue cracking the horizontal tensile strain (εt
) at 
the bottom of the lowest asphalt mix layer is considered. Rutting in the asphalt mix layer only is 
considered to be due to consolidation due to improper compaction of the layer during construction. 
Design charts are the basis of this design procedure. The design charts were generated with the 
use of the computer program DAMA, originally developed in 1983 (Asphalt Institute, 1983), which 
determined the largest of the two strains and recommended the thickness of the layer to meet the 
higher (or more critical) of the two strains on the basis of inputs which include resilient modulus of 
the subgrade, selection of type of surface and base layers, traffc information, and mean annual air 
temperature. 
The procedure is illustrated with an example in Figure 12.23. In the AI method, a minimum 
thickness of asphalt mix surface layers is provided for different types of bases—emulsion treated 
and untreated. Charts are provided for different mean annual air temperatures—45°F, 60°F, and 
75°F. Limits of CBR, Atterberg Limits, and percentage passing the No. 200 sieve for subbase/base 
are also provided.

design period, the pavement can be constructed in stages. The initial thickness can accommodate

a certain number of years of traffc, and the second construction adds the thickness required for 
sustaining the remaining traffc for the full design period. 
The principle of design in staged construction is that the second construction will take place 
(say, as an overlay) before the frst pavement has reached the end of its life. Based on the concept of 
cumulative damage (discussed earlier), it is often assumed that the second overlay will be applied 
when the frst pavement has at least 40% of its life left (i.e., damage is a maximum of 60%).

12.4.2.3 NCHRP 1-37A Mechanistic-Empirical Design Guide 
The NCHRP 1-37A Mechanistic Empirical Design Method (commonly referred to as the 2002 
Design Guide), currently known as the AASHTOWare Pavement ME Design was developed in 
NCHRP Project 1-37A (Development of the 2002 Guide for the Design of New and Rehabilitated 
Pavement Structures) (NCHRP, 2004). The guide presents a very comprehensive method with con￾siderations of appropriate sophisticated models and uses state-of-the-art testing procedures. 
The guide suggests three different levels of design: Level 1, which requires very basic infor￾mation and the use of correlations; Level 2, which requires some test data; and, fnally, Level 
3, for which most of the data needed to be input are obtained from testing. The basic prem￾ises of this guide are the same as the mechanistic principles discussed in Chapter 11. Note that 
the models have been calibrated against national data (in the United States and Canada)—it is 
extremely important that those models be calibrated against locally available data before the 
guide is adopted by any specifc state or local transportation department. In the meantime, the 
guide/software serves as a very useful tool for checking the sensitivity of the performance/dis￾tress of the pavements to the different control variables. The most powerful feature of the guide is 
the ability to cycle through variations in material properties as a function of changes in seasonal 
conditions and compute the incremental damage due to cumulative traffc loading through the 
different seasons for long design periods. This concept is illustrated with an example output in 
Figure 12.24. Note that it shows three relevant factors—cumulative traffc, changes in modulus 
of asphalt mix, and total rutting during the entire 20-year design period. Such plots can also be 
generated for other types of distresses.

The different parameters that need to be input are shown in Table 12.6, and the steps in running 
the software (for a Level 1 design) for the guide are presented thereafter. A brief description of the 
different steps is provided in the following paragraphs. 
12.4.2.3.1 Overview of the Software 
The software is a Windows-based application for the simulation of pavement structures. It can 
be used to simulate pavement structures under different traffc and climatic conditions. The soft￾ware has the ability to predict the amount of damage that a structure will display at the end of its 
simulated design life. In addition to using laboratory test results, predicting properties for pave￾ment mixes can be done by using correlations. Values (either default or entered by the user) that 
represent structural, climatic, or traffc properties are used in calculating distresses. The following 
example demonstrates how to provide the different inputs for a design project. The project is based 
in Guilford, Maine, and is designed for a 20-year life. 
12.4.2.3.2 Creating a New Project 
To create a new project, frst open the Design Guide 2002 software. Click on File, then New; a 
window, as shown in Figure 12.25, will pop up. Here you can specify the name of the project, the 
folder to create it in, and the measurement system (currently the software can only handle U.S. 
Customary). After this is complete, clicking OK will bring you into the main software console 
(shown in Figure 12.26). When running the software, the red boxes next to each section indicate that 
information needs to be entered; yellow boxes indicate that there are default values for that section 
which need to be either accepted or changed.

Before running the analysis, there are two simple steps that need to be taken care of: 
Check all values that you entered. This ensures that there will be no surprises or inaccuracies 
on your part when the simulation is fnished. 
Save your work before running the simulation. If anything happens to the computer or the 
software, you will not have to reenter all of your work. 
ISTUDY396 Pavement Engineering 
Once you have verifed your inputs and saved the program, run the simulation by clicking Run 
Analysis. Depending on the speed of your computer and the design life that you have entered, the 
software can take anywhere from 30 to 90 min or more (based on runs on a laptop computer, Dell 
Inspiron 8100, with Microsoft Windows XP 2002 Professional, 1200 MHz Intel Pentium III, 256 
MB of RAM, and 20 GB hard drive).

12.5 THICKNESS OF HOT MIX ASPHALT LAYERS TO AVOID 
EXCESSIVE PERMEABILITY 
Several studies have shown that excessive permeability of surface layers lead to premature 
damage of pavements through moisture damage/stripping, raveling, oxidation and cracking. 
Because air voids have signifcant effect on permeability, typically, in the feld mixes are 
compacted to higher than 92% of theoretical maximum density, that is below 8% voids to 
avoid excessive permeability. However, many mixes, especially coarse graded and with high 
Nominal Maximum Aggregate Size (NMAS), exhibit relatively high permeability even below 
8% voids (Figure 12.57). Note that Brown et al., (2004) have considered 125 X 10−5 cm/s as a 
critical feld permeability. 
While the lift thickness of a HMA layer is determined through structural design, it is impor￾tant to consider the combined impact of lift thickness, gradation, and air voids on permeability. 
For the same amount of voids, thicker lifts tend to have less interconnectivity of voids, and hence 
lower permeability (Brown et al., 2004). Therefore, for coarse gradations, which typically cor￾respond to mixes with high NMAS, relatively thicker lifts are desirable to avoid excessive perme￾ability. Since thicker lifts facilitate tighter packing of aggregates and smaller aggregates reduce 
the interconnectivity of voids, either thicker lifts or, if not possible, using smaller aggregates is 
desirable for surface HMA layers, and in general the lift thickness should be at least greater than 
3 times the NMAS for fne graded mixes and 4 times the NMAS for coarse graded mixes (Brown 
et al., 2004). To avoid rapid cooling (recall the use of PaveCool software mentioned earlier) and 
subsequent problem with compaction, a minimum thickness of 38 mm has been recommended 
for HMA lists (Brown et al., 2004). Recommendations regarding desirable lift thicknesses for 
different mixes are given in Table 12.7. Note that although fne and coarse graded mixes can be 
defned as those with gradations lying above and below the maximum density line (in the FHWA 
0.45 power plot of gradation), guidance regarding this classifcation is provided by NAPA (2001), 
as shown in Table 12.8. During construction, the use of rubber tired rollers for fnishing compac￾tion is more effective in tightly kneading the surface and hence reducing surface infltration than 
steel wheel rollers.

Construction of 13 Asphalt Pavements 
13.1 OVERVIEW 
The essential steps in the construction of asphalt pavements consist of selecting proper materi￾als and conducting a proper mix design, ensuring drying and mixing of aggregates from properly 
maintained stockpiles, mixing aggregates with asphalt binder, delivering the mix in insulated trucks 
in a smooth way so as to match with paver speed, laying down with a paver, and using a properly 
selected combination of rollers of desirable weight and type, with correct vibration frequency and/ 
or tire pressure, in a correct rolling pattern. The rollers should be close to the paver and operating 
with desirable speed and manner of reversing and turning. All of the equipment should be in good 
operating condition. And, very importantly, good quality control must be ensured at every step in 
the plant and during laydown and rolling operations. There must be clear communication of any 
problems between the plant and the site, and if required, adjustments should be made in mix design, 
plant production, transportation, and laydown and rolling operations. Provisions should be made 
to use additives in the materials, such as natural rounded sand to reduce the harshness of a mix, 
and/or employ special equipment, such as a material transfer vehicle to reduce temperature-related 
segregation, if required. 
13.1.1 PRODUCTION 
The production of loose hot mix asphalt (HMA) starts in the HMA plant—which can be of 
either batch (Figure 13.1) or drum type (parallel or counterfow, depending on whether the 
aggregates enter the drum from the burner fame side or from the opposite side, respectively; 
Figure 13.2). 
In both plants, the steps consist of heating and drying aggregates and mixing them with heated 
liquid asphalt binder. In a batch plant, the production happens in “batches”—one batch of aggre￾gates of different sizes is dried in a drum, moved up in a hot elevator, and mixed with asphalt in a 
pugmill. In the case of a drum plant, the production is a continuous process—aggregates of differ￾ent sizes are dried in the front part of the dryer drum and then mixed with the liquid asphalt binder 
in the back part of the drum. In a batch plant, aggregates are collected on cold feed conveyors, 
heated in a dryer drum, moved up a hot elevator, rescreened over a screen deck and separated into 
hot bins, and then mixed with asphalt in the pugmill. In the drum plant, the tower, consisting of the 
hot elevator, hot bins, and pugmill, is eliminated; mixing is done in the drum. Hybrid plants, using 
some features of both batch and drum plants, are also being used. 
Drum plants are continuous as opposed to batch plants where every batch of aggregate should 
be weighed and mixed individually. However, batch plants are also more effcient in cases of short 
production runs or delays in hauling or when multiple types of mixes are required (such as paving 
for highways, parking lots, and driveways) in urban areas. Batch sizes in typical hot mix asphalt 
batch plants are 2–8 tons per batch. 
The production of HMA is a complex process and requires preparation and continuous supervi￾sion by experienced and trained people. Once the HMA is produced, it is either stored in a silo or put 
in trucks for transportation to the job site. The silo must be properly insulated to prevent oxidation 
and heat loss from the HMA. The trucks also need to be insulated (sometimes heated) to minimize 
heat loss from the HMA during transportation.

13.1.2 TRANSPORTATION AND LAYDOWN 
Once the trucks arrive at the job site, the HMA is transferred either directly to the paver or to a paver 
through a material transfer device (MTD). The role of the MTD is to remix the HMA to avoid or 
reduce the potential of segregation; an added beneft is that it allows continuous paving—it can be 
used when the paver hopper becomes empty and before more trucks arrive with new HMA. 
The paver lays down the HMA at a specifc thickness with the help of the screed. It also provides 
some compaction to the mix. The remaining compaction is provided by the roller(s) following the 
paver. Generally, rollers with these distinct features are used. A double drum steel roller is used for 
breakdown rolling, a static steel drum or pneumatic roller is used for intermediate rolling, and usu￾ally a static steel drum roller is used for fnishing. 
Generally, a mix will get compacted by 20%–25%. Generally used thicker lifts are 2–4 in., and 
thinner lifts are 1–2 in. Thicker lifts are easier to compact since they retain heat longer and also 
help avoid the bridging tendency of thinner lifts. Thinner lifts, though, provide good results through 
better smoothness and help avoid shoving, which could happen in thicker lifts. 
Tack coats in the form of sprayed asphalt or emulsion (typically diluted slow set) are used to pro￾vide a bond between the old surface and the new asphalt mix layer. This is applied on the existing 
surface before the application of the HMA. Prior to the application of the tack coat, the surface should 
be clean, dry, and free from loose materials, and the coat is applied preferably at surface temperatures 
> 80°F and not applied under cold and/or wet conditions. The right kind and amount should be used, 
and adequate time should be given for curing before the HMA is laid down. The typical application 
rate is residual asphalt content of 0.03–0.04 for a new layer, 0.04–0.06 for an oxidized layer, 0.06– 
0.08 for milled HMA and concrete layers, and 0.04–0.06 gal/yard2 for concrete pavement. The actual 
application rate is generally determined by multiplying the residual content by 1.5, assuming 2/3 
residual asphalt and 1/3rd water in an emulsion. Typically it is applied in double lap with a distributor 
truck, in a thin coat, and uniformly to cover the entire surface, including all vertical surfaces of joints 
and structures. Some agencies also use PG grade asphalt binder for tack coat. The HMA overlay 
should be placed only after the tack coat breaks as evident from a color change form brown to black. 
13.2 DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS OF COMPONENTS 
IN HOT MIX ASPHALT-PRODUCING PLANTS 
13.2.1 AGGREGATE STOCKPILES 
Aggregate stockpiles (Figure 13.3) should have uniform gradation of aggregates in all parts and 
must be free from foreign materials and excessive amounts of moisture. The moisture content 
should be fairly constant throughout the depth of the stockpile. 
FIGURE 13.3 Aggregate stockpiles. 
(Courtesy of Matthew Teto, All States Asphalt, Sunderland, MA.) 
ISTUDY 
408 Pavement Engineering 
Stockpiles should be constructed in the proper sequence using power equipment. Proper stock￾piling should include remixing of materials, layering of remixed materials, and dispersion of newly 
delivered materials into existing piles. Front-end loaders are generally used. If trucks are used, then 
the pile should be built in layers with each pile being one truck load of material. Manipulation by 
dozers should be limited. The stockpiles should be separated from each other and built on a surface 
with good drainage, and all parts of the stockpiles should be accessible and reachable from all sides. 
13.2.2 COLD FEED BINS 
The purpose of the cold feed bin system, which consists of multiple bins, is to provide a controlled 
distribution of aggregate in the conveyor system. The cold feed system (Figure 13.4) is controlled 
by manipulating the relative amounts of the different constituents as well as by the rate at which the 
material is fed into the drum. Cold bins contain the aggregates and direct them toward the cold feed 
through their sloping sides. The cold feed can be of the belt, vibratory, or apron type. The rate of fow 
from a bin into the cold feed is controlled by the adjustable gate at the bottom of the bins as well as 
by the rpm of the belt feeders or the frequency/amplitude of the vibratory feeders. The actual fow rate 
has to be calibrated for different aggregates with difference in gradation, shape, and moisture content. 
From the cold feeder the aggregate drops into a moving belt, which collects aggregates from 
multiple bins, which deliver the materials directly or through a scalping screen to the drum, as well 
as to sampling chutes. The fnal drop into the drum happens through an inclined belt, with scales 
for measuring the amount of aggregate, which dictates the amount of asphalt that should be added 
to the aggregates in the drum, if it is a drum plant. 
The aggregate feeders need to be calibrated to determine the speed required to feed aggregates at 
a desired rate during production. The following steps are conducted to calibrate the feeders: 
1. Close all feeders except the one being calibrated. 
2. Run materials into the belt. 
3. Determine the amount of material in a given length of the belt. 
4. Adjust the feeder and repeat steps 2 and 3. 
5. Calibrate the next feeder using steps 1–4. 
6. Determine the speed of the belt. 
The relationship between the different parameters can be expressed as follows (Roberts et al., 1996):

13.2.3 DRUM MIX PLANT 
In a batch plant the drum acts as a dryer. The drum is tilted, and the aggregates enter the upper 
end of the drum and fow toward the lower end where the burner provides the heat for drying the 
aggregates (Figure 13.5). The burner works on oil and/or gas with a regulated fow of air from a 
blower. The system for supplying fuel and air needs to be checked to ensure complete combustion 
of the fuel. The fow of hot air is further increased by an exhaust fan. The long thin fame of the 
burner as well as the hot gases leaving the drum near the entry point of the aggregates dry off their 
moisture and heat them to a high temperature. The aggregates tumble through the fame through a 
set of fights inside the drum as it turns during the drying process. The time for which the aggregate 
remains in the dryer drum is known as the dwell time. It is important to use a proper dwell time, 
taking into consideration the amount of moisture in the aggregates, and the temperature to which 
it should be heated to mix with the asphalt binder. This temperature is equal to the temperature of 
the asphalt binder at which it has the optimum viscosity for mixing. For the proper dwell time, the 
moisture content of aggregates leaving the drum must not exceed 0.5%. Dwell time can be increased 
by slowing the drum rotation (not done typically because of inconvenience; generally between 
7–12 rpm), lowering the tilt angle of the drum, rearranging the fights inside the drum, or increasing 
the total length of the dryer drum. If required, the amount of aggregate that is fed into the dryer, 
per unit time, should be decreased. Note that aggregates with higher moisture content will require 
more heat and hence more fuel to drive the moisture, and it is always advisable to store aggregates 
in enclosed storage areas. 
13.2.4 HOT ELEVATOR AND BINS 
The hot aggregates leave the dryer drum in a chute and are picked up by buckets in the hot eleva￾tor (Figure 13.6), which delivers it to the screen deck in the tower. The screen deck has a number 
of vibrating screen decks, arranged in a way such that the screen with the largest opening is at 
the top and the smallest opening is at the bottom. The screen sizes may range from 1½ to 5/32 in. 
The screened aggregates land in hot bins that are placed beneath the screens. The screens help to

FIGURE 13.6 Hot elevator.

separate the composite aggregate sample batch into different portions, depending on their size. Note 
that it is the fnal screening in this step that determines the blend of the aggregate in the mix, and 
hence the screens must operate effciently without getting blinded due to processes such as high 
rates of loading or loading of improperly sized aggregates or due to blinding of the screens them￾selves due to poor maintenance. The malfunctioning of screens causes the dumping of aggregates 
into inappropriate bins (“carryover”), and this affects the quality of the asphalt mix. 
The function of the hot bins is to provide adequate temporary storage for the separate hot aggre￾gates before mixing with the asphalt binder in the weigh hopper below them. Narrow hot bin gates 
open into the weigh hopper. Quality control samples should be taken at this point from hot bins to 
ensure proper functioning. To ensure a smooth fow of materials from the screen decks to the bins 
and into the hopper and avoid segregation, it is important that the aggregates are supplied through 
the cold feed at a rate that is consistent with the demand for production. The plant operator could 
check on the relative amounts of materials in the different bins and, if needed, adjust the cold feed. 
A predetermined mass of aggregate from each hot bin (based on the mix design of the asphalt mix 
being produced) is dropped from the hot bins, one by one, to a hopper on a scale (weigh hopper). The 
batch is complete when all of the constituent aggregates have been dropped on the weigh hopper, 
and the cumulative mass is printed on a batch ticket, which is used as supporting documentation for 
verifcation of compliance with mix design. 
13.2.5 PUGMILL 
In the next step, the weigh hopper empties the aggregates into the pugmill (Figure 13.7), where they are 
mixed with each other and with the asphalt binder with two mixing shafts with paddles, which rotate in 
opposite directions. It is important to make sure that the paddles are in good condition (and not worn 
out) and that the pugmill is flled to its optimum height (bottom to top of the paddles—the “live zone”) 
to ensure good mixing. There are two stages of mixing in the pugmill: dry, when the aggregates are 
mixed with each other, typically 2 s or less, and wet, when the asphalt binder is introduced either by 
gravity or through a pressurized spray, typically 25–35 s. The total mixing time, which includes dry 
mixing time, wet mixing time, opening time of the pugmill gates below, discharge time of the mix, 
and closing time of the pugmill gates, affects the quality of the mix as well as the rate of production. 
ISTUDYConstruction of Asphalt Pavements 411 
 
 
Pugmill 
FIGURE 13.7 Pugmill, view from the bottom with discharge door removed. 
(Courtesy of Matthew Teto, All States Asphalt, Sunderland, MA.) 
13.2.6 HAULING AND STORAGE 
The mix from the pugmill is either carried away by hauling trucks to a job site or taken to a storage 
silo through a chute in a drag slat conveyor. The truck must be positioned underneath the pugmill to 
avoid spillage and one-sided drops, and ensure proper discharge, which is generally made by loading 
the front end of the truck frst, then the back end, and fnally the middle portion, to avoid segregation. 
Drag slat conveyors (Figure 13.8) move the asphalt mix from the pugmill to either surge silos 
(Figure 13.8) for temporary storage (a few hours) or storage silos for long-term storage (overnight 
to several days). Drag slat conveyors have steel plates set at a 90° angle to the drag chain and are 
typically enclosed to prevent any loss of heat from the mix. 
Whenever there is movement of HMA mix, there is a tendency of coarser aggregate particles 
to roll down and get separated from the fner aggregates. This not only separates the aggregates of 
different sizes, but also creates an uneven distribution of asphalt binder in the mix, since it is the 
fner particle/matrix that contains more asphalt than the coarse aggregates. To minimize movement, 
sometimes a batcher is used for loading the silos from the slat conveyor. The batcher has a small 
hopper, which gets flled through a chute at the center, with a batch of mix. This batch of mix is then 
released to fall into the silo through gates at the bottom of the batcher. This way the silo is flled 
up in batches, and not in a continuous stream of HMA (thus limiting movement and segregation). 
To minimize segregation from loading out from the silo, the trucks must be positioned properly 
beneath it, and loaded front frst, then back, and fnally the middle. Mix from the silo should not be 
used unless there is adequate mix inside the silo above the bottom cone portion of the silo. Also, if 
required, heated oil-carrying pipes throughout the shell of the silo could keep the mix warm, and 
inert gases could be used to reduce the oxidation of the mix inside. 
13.2.7 DRUM PLANT 
In a drum plant, the aggregates are dried, heated, and mixed with the asphalt binder in the same 
drum, which is usually longer than the dryer drum used in a batch plant. Vast majority of currently 
used drums are of counter fow type, because of better emission controls and greater effciency of 
heating reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) material. The drum has three distinct zones—the dry￾ing, heating, and mixing zones. The fame in the drum is shorter and wider, and the aggregates are 
kept in fights along the perimeter of the drum in the frst zone, to prevent them from coming in 
direct contact with the fame. In the second zone, the fights cascade the aggregates through the cen￾ter of the drum and through the hot burner gases; as a result the aggregates get heated up to a high

temperature. The confguration of the fights as well as the geometry of the drum could be varied in 
this zone to achieve this objective. Finally, in the mixing zone, fights are used to coat the aggregates 
with asphalt binder which is injected into the drum. 
Although a typical drum is as it is described earlier, numerous variations, as a result of continuous 
development processes, have resulted over the years, specifcally to improve the effciency of the heating 
process and often to accommodate the use of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) materials (Figure 13.9). 
Two such developments are the concepts of the double-barrel drum and the triple-barrel drum, which 
have outer “shells” that improve the heating process of aggregates and at the same time cut down the 
potential of excessive oxidation of the asphalt binder–RAP materials. Another important development, 
in the context of paving jobs in remote areas, is the availability of portable drum plants, which can be 
transported from one site to another and readied for operation in a relatively short period of time. Note 
that counterfow drums are indeed used in many of these newly developed drum mix plants. 
ISTUDYConstruction of Asphalt Pavements 413 
 
 
13.2.8 DUST COLLECTION FROM HMA PLANTS 
Dust is created during the drying, heating, and mixing of aggregates and asphalt. The dust primarily 
results from the existing fne portions of the aggregate; is created by abrasion during mixing, blown 
out by gases, or created by the air used for the burner; it comes from steam from the evaporation 
of water from the aggregates. The dust is actually captured through a collecting mechanism and 
prevented from polluting the environment. Air quality codes from regulatory agencies direct the 
plants to test for particulate emissions in the exhaust gases from the plant to ensure the effciency 
of the dust-collecting system. 
The dust-collecting system consists of a primary and secondary mechanism. In the primary sys￾tem, the relatively bigger size particles are separated from the exhaust gases. This is accomplished 
by either expanding the gases, reducing their velocity, and making the heavier particles drop out 
in the “knockout box” (expansion chamber process) or by speeding up the gases by directing them 
in a spiral fow through a chamber and separating the bigger particles by centrifugal force (cyclone 
method). The particles collected in the knockout box or the cyclone chamber are directed to a min￾eral fller silo where they could later be reused for producing HMA. 
In the secondary system of dust collection, either a baghouse (Figure 13.10) or a wet scrubber 
method is employed. In the baghouse method, bags stacked in vertical rows capture the particles as 
exhaust gases fow through them. The bags need to be cleaned periodically (generally by fexing, 
shaking, and blowing air pulses), and the recovered particles could be reused. 
13.2.9 ASPHALT STORAGE TANKS 
Asphalt tanks (Figure 13.11) maintain asphalts in a plant at a required temperature such that they 
can be supplied steadily to the pugmill or the drum at the desirable viscosity. Coiled pipes carrying 
hot oils around the periphery of the tanks maintain the high temperature. Delivery pipes are insu￾lated to prevent loss of heat. It is important to note the grade and level of the binder before pumping 
new asphalt from a tanker to a storage tank.

13.3 EQUIPMENT USED FOR TRANSPORTATION, 
LAYDOWN, AND COMPACTION 
13.3.1 TRUCKS 
For long-distance hauling, trucks should be insulated. A tarpaulin (canvas) should be used to hold 
heat, keep light rain showers off the HMA, and keep away dust. However, note that the tarp needs 
to be tied down properly—otherwise it will tend to fap in air and will actually cool down the mix 
by fanning as the truck moves down the road. Truck beds should be clean, and trucks should be 
loaded properly to avoid segregation. Typically, trucks should be loaded in the front frst, then in the 
back, and fnally in the middle. Trucks can be of different types—end dump, bottom or belly dump 
(high capacity) and live bottom (fow-boy; delivers HMA by a conveyor). The frst one is suitable for 
paving on congested streets as it has better maneuverability because of its size and the absence of a 
trailer; the second one is suitable for paving on rural roads; the third one can be used for mixes with 
a potential of segregation. The bed in the end dump truck generally extends past the rear wheels 
such that the mix could be dumped into the paver hopper or else an apron is attached to the bed. The 
bed should ft the hopper without having to press down on the paver, and the truck should not make 
contact with the paver during delivery of the mix to avoid forcing the screed back into the mat and 
causing a bump on the pavement. To avoid segregation of the mix, the truck bed should be raised 
slowly. A windrow blender can be attached to end dump truck to place mix in a windrow. 
Mix from the bottom or belly dump trucks are deposited directly onto the pavement in a wind￾row, either through a spreader box under the dump gates or through chains used to control dump 
gate openings. A windrow elevator picks up the mix and transfers it to the paver. The length of the 
deposit should be controlled to make sure that the temperature of the mix does not drop below the 
desirable placement and compaction temperatures. 
A conveyor belt or a slat conveyor is used to deposit mix from a live bottom (fow-boy) through 
the bottom of the truck bed, either directly onto a hopper or in a windrow. Before transportation, 
generally load tickets are issued at the plant that contain the project number, type of mix, origin, 
weight, time of load, and its temperature. 
Sometimes a material transfer vehicle is used to receive the mix from the truck or pick up from 
a windrow, store it, remix it with augers, and then transfer it to the paver. This helps in maintaining 
ISTUDYConstruction of Asphalt Pavements 415 
the uniformity of the mix and reduce temperature differences, avoid bumping of haul trucks onto 
pavers, and maintaining constant paving operations. 
Note that prior to the placement of an HMA layer, a tack coat of emulsion (at the rate of 0.01–0.2 
gal/square yard, residual, depending on the type of surface) is generally applied on the existing 
surface to help bond it with the new layer (Figure 13.12). The surface must be cleaned prior to the 
application of the tack coat. Figure 13.13 shows a view of an HMA paving site with the different 
equipment.

416 Pavement Engineering 
13.3.2 PAVERS 
The HMA is placed and compacted to a certain degree with the paver (Figure 13.14). The paver 
is rubber or steel-track mounted and consists of a hopper to receive the material from the truck 
or a material transfer vehicle, conveyors to send the material to the back, augers (with available 
extensions) to distribute the mix transversely across the width of the pavement, and a screed (often 
heated, capable of vibrating, and with extensions), which ensures a specifc depth of the material and 
preliminary compaction. Maintaining a constant head (depth) of the material in front of screed is 
required for good quality control (including smoothness) and is generally achieved through the use 
of properly placed defector plates and auger fights. The screed provides a compaction of 75%–85% 
of theoretical maximum density (pre-compaction). Paving widths with available equipment can 
range from 8 to 48 ft. The plant and hauling operations should be adjusted to ensure uniform and 
continuous operation of the paver. Screed setting and confguration adjustments, such as increasing 
weight, amplitude of the tamper bar, or reducing paving speed, should be done in small increments, 
only when necessary, to avoid problems in paving adjacent lanes and to improve pre-compaction. 
To facilitate dynamic compaction, the vibratory screed may consist of one or both of tamper bars 
and pressure bars; however, adding them generally slows down the paving speed. Modern screeds 
are electrically heated to achieve uniform temperature and facilitation of smoother paving surfaces. 
The paver should be operated with a uniform forward speed and avoid quick starts and stops. A 
hydraulic system can be utilized to hold the screed form sinking down into the material when the 
paver has to wait for HMA from the haul trucks. 
Grade control is usually done with a stringline/mobile ski, sonic/laser, and GPS system. Recent 
developments in paver technology include the use of a variable speed engine to save fuel and reduce 
noise whenever possible, specially designed pipes to remove heat and exhaust from the crew, better 
turning capability, design of paver components to reduce the chance of segregation of the mix, and 
redesign of the paver to improve operator visibility. 
Placement of mixes in certain areas may be impossible with pavers and handwork is needed 
for spreading the mix. Placement and spreading generally involve shovels and lutes, respectively. 
Materials should be loosened before spreading and hard lumps should be discarded; prior to rolling 
the area should be checked with template and straightedge. 
FIGURE 13.14 Paver.

ISTUDYConstruction of Asphalt Pavements 417 
13.3.3 ROLLERS 
Compaction of layers is achieved by reducing the volume of air in the mix and also by reorienting 
the aggregate particles. The two methods that are effective for densifcation are compression and 
the creation of shear stress between compressed and adjacent uncompressed materials. Rollers are 
used for breakdown and intermediate rolling, compaction, and fnish rolling to remove roller marks. 
Available drum widths (rolling widths) range from 3 to 7 ft, approximately. Generally, a vibratory 
or static steel-wheel roller, with the frst drum as the driver, is used for breakdown. The contact 
pressure that ensures compaction can be altered by changing the ballast load or dynamic force (in 
the case of a vibratory roller) or the tire pressure (for a rubber-tired roller). Rollers (Figure 13.15) 
can be rubber tired (these rollers are usually 15–20 tons in weight, and their tire pressure is gener￾ally around 90 psi, with 4500 lb per tire), a vibratory steel-wheel roller (usually 10 tons in weight 
with high-frequency and low-amplitude vibrations), and a static steel-wheel roller (10–12 tons). 
Increasingly, echelon rolling with two rollers of the same make and model behind the paver is being 
used to take the advantage of higher mat temperature and avoid the need for different types of roll￾ers and roller marks on the mat. Recent developments in rollers include the provision for oscillation 
(for compaction of thin layers and sensitive areas such as bridge decks) or vibration in both drums 
and sensors for continuous monitoring of compaction of the mat. Another type of roller is one that 
consists of three wheels of the same diameter and with equal compressive force per linear inch—all 
of which are powered. Such rollers are suitable for compaction of thin lifts and city pavements built 
of fragile structures where vibrations are not appropriate. Such rollers reduce shoving during com￾paction and also provide the option of increasing the forces using water ballast. Short radius high 
vibration with smaller drums (e.g., 35.4 in., Sakai CR 270, https://spectehnikan.com/wp-content/ 
uploads/pdf/tandemniy-katok-sakai-cr-270.pdf) are available for compaction around utilities as well 
as for compaction of driveways, bike paths, and road maintenance areas. Intelligent compaction (IC) 
rollers (concept originally developed for soil and subbase compaction) are also being used for com￾paction of HMA. These (vibratory steel wheel) rollers are equipped with GPS, infrared temperature 
sensors, accelerometers (on roller frame near drum), a processing unit, data storage, and a display. 
As the roller moves over the mat, the operator gets a live display of the “Intelligent Compaction 
Measurement Value” (ICMV), which is a measure of the stiffness of the material. The data helps 
the operator identify weak spots, maintain uniformity of compaction, and determine the optimum 
number of roller passes for a specifc job.

13.4 IMPORTANT FACTORS 
Several factors infuence the asphalt pavement construction process, and their proper consider￾ation is absolutely necessary to ensure good construction. The factors, with discussion, are listed 
as follows: 
1. Meet specifcations for aggregates and binders. 
2. Control quality with properly trained and equipped personnel. 
3. Maintain the fow of materials to the paver at a speed so as to limit the time the paver is 
kept waiting. 
4. Ensure the smooth transfer of materials from the truck to the paver while the paver is moving. 
5. All the mechanisms, such as the conveyor, hopper gate, and auger in the paver should be 
working properly to maintain a good and consistent amount of HMA at the correct tem￾perature in front of the screed. 
6. Ensure paving with a minimum number of transverse joints. 
7. The reference point for screed operation should not be readjusted too much—avoid con￾stant/frequent readjustments of the paver’s automatic controls. 
8. Use proper guidelines to select the correct rolling techniques—the types and number of 
rollers, number of passes, and rolling pattern. 
9. Make sure that the equipment, such as the paver and rollers, is in good operating condition. 
10. During laydown or rolling, if a problem is identifed as a material or mix design related 
problem, then it must be reported to the laboratory/plant as quickly as possible to ensure

13.5 CONSTRUCTION OF GRANULAR LAYERS 
The main steps in the construction of subgrade consist of compaction at optimum moisture content, 
grading, and mixing soils as needed for uniformity and stabilization. The edge of the subgrade can 
be extended 3 ft outside the edge of the pavement for providing a stable platform for supporting 
construction equipment. For construction of base course, the steps consist of material transporta￾tion to the site (with minimal transfer points to minimize segregation), spreading and grading, and 
compaction with vibratory drum rollers. 
The specifcations for aggregate bases generally consist of gradation, thickness, and density. 
Lean concrete base (LCB) is produced in plants, whereas cement treated base (CTB) can be 
produced in plants or in place. A slipform paver is used for the placement of materials produced in 
the plant. CTB can be constructed in-place by using cement spreading and mixing equipment or an 
equipment train. Curing of CTB is achieved by the light fog spray of water and bituminous curing 
material at a rate of 0.15–0.25 gal/yd2. LCB is cured with an application of double coats of wax￾based curing materials, which prevent evaporation of water and acts as a bond breaker between the 
LCB and the concrete layer above. 
Quality control specifcation for CTB and LCB may include thickness and grade, density, cement 
content, gradation of aggregates, and strength. 
The equipment used for constructing asphalt-treated base (ATB) can be used for constructing 
base course with RAP materials. 
13.5.1 RECYCLED CONCRETE AGGREGATE (RCA) AND RECYCLED CONCRETE 
MATERIAL (RCM) IN GRANULAR OR STABILIZED BASE COURSE 
When used in stabilized layers, the properties of the RCA should be considered with respect to the 
surface texture, absorption, and angularity. Standard equipment and acceptance tests that are used 
for construction of base courses are also used for RCA base courses. 
The use of RCA can result in differences in properties as compared to standard aggregates in 
a number of ways which include lower specifc gravity, higher surface texture, higher absorption, 
optimum moisture content, sulfate soundness loss, higher CBR, higher shear strength, resilient 
modulus, and rutting resistance. 
13.5.2 STEPS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN ASPHALT PAVEMENT 
For horizontal and vertical grade control of the subgrade—identify centerline, place grade and line 
stakes on either side and parallel to the centerline at a fxed distance, with a spacing of 100 ft or less, 
in curves. Motor graders are used for achieving proper grades. For the construction of base layers 
any signifcant deviations from proper grades (such as 1/4 in. to 1/2 in.) is corrected. 
The placement of the new HMA layer may be preceded by crack sealing/flling, patching, lev￾eling course (shim), or recycling of the existing HMA, if any. Generally, any existing HMA is 
milled before the placement of the new HMA. A prime coat is applied over a prepared subgrade 
or an aggregate base layer to minimize raveling under traffc, bind the fner particles near the sur￾face, prevent the ingress of moisture, and bond (improve adhesion) the frst HMA layer (binder 
layer) to the unbound layer. Before the application of the prime coat the surface should be swept to 
remove dust. The prime coat generally consists of a sprayed application of medium cure cutback 
(0.2–0.5 gal/yd2
) or an asphalt emulsion (0.1–0.3 gal/yd2
); the emulsion is generally mixed with top 
1 inch of the base with a rotary mixer or a motor grader. The prime coat should penetrate within the 
subgrade or the base and should not break too quickly. Typically the curing period can be 24 h, and 
the coat should cure completely before the application of the next layer. Beyond 24 h excess prime 
coat material should be removed by the application of blotter sand (ice chat, materials used for sand￾ing roads and bridges during snow or ice), crushed rock, or stone screenings smaller than Grade 5

rock, defned by the Texas DOT as materials with nominal size of 0.19 in. (number 4 sieve), smaller 
than 1/4 in. but larger than 0.09 in. (number 8 sieve), bottom ash (by-product of coal-fred electricity 
generation plants), fne to medium grained sandy materials from road shoulders or creek banks, or 
bottom ash and sand blended materials. In cold weather, because of the risk of not curing, the prime 
coat is generally avoided, as is also done when no wet weather is expected, the layer is covered 
within 7 days or when the next HMA layer is > 4 in. in thickness, over stabilized base or subgrades, 
or when there is a signifcant risk of runoff of the prime coat to nearby waterways. 
A comprehensive guideline on the use of prime and tack coat by Cross and Shrestha (2005) is 
available at http://hawaiiasphalt.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Prime-Tack-Coats-FHWA-July-2005. 
pdf. 
Problems and visual clues associated with transportation of mix from plant to job site include 
overheated load (blue smoke), cooling (stiff appearance), excessive moisture (steam), excessive 
binder (fat instead of dome shaped), low asphalt content, or excess fne aggregates (lean or dull). 
A safety edge can be constructed in pavements without a HMA shoulder such as low volume 
roads with gravel shoulders. The edge consists of a 30° angle at the side, constructed with an angled 
shoe fxed to the paver. For thicknesses > 5 in., a 2 in. straight edge is maintained at the bottom. 
13.6 SPECIFICATIONS 
Specifcations include description of construction materials, methods, and/or end product. There 
are primarily three types of specifcations: performance-based specifcations, end product based 
method specifcation, and proprietary specifcation. 
There are advantages and disadvantages of different kinds of specifcations. For example, a 
performance or end result based specifcation could be shorter but relatively diffcult to prepare; 
although it is easy to write a method specifcation, the results may not correlate well with perfor￾mance. While writing a proprietary specifcation is relatively easy, it does not allow the use of equal 
or better materials and does not encourage innovations and competition. 
An example of method based specifcation for compaction of an HMA pavement is as follows. 
Use two passes with a vibratory roller weighing at least 10 ton. Vibrations per minute must 
exceed 1000, and the roller shall not travel faster than 4 miles/h. 
For the same purpose, a performance based specifcation could be written as follows: compact 
the HMA to at least 98% of laboratory density. Most specifcations combine aspects of both method 
based and performance based specifcations. 
Contracts for construction of asphalt pavements can be made through the low-bid system, best￾bid system, or negotiated contract. In the low-bid system, generally the lowest bidder is selected. 
Although this system provides a fair and rational method of decision, it could lead to cutting cor￾ners. In the best-bid system, more emphasis is placed on the performance and experience of the 
contractor. In a negotiated contract, the owner negotiates the work with a specifc contractor. 
In the construction process, standards and specifcations from ASTM and AASHTO are also 
followed. Most agencies would prepare a project specifcation from a list of guideline specifcations 
from ASTM or AASHTO. Specifcations and standards are particularly important with respect to 
sampling and testing for quality control and quality assurance. 
A good specifcation must include a description of the following: 
1. Lot size is the amount of materials that needs to be evaluated for acceptance or rejection. 
For example, 1 day of production of HMA. 
2. Test properties indicate the properties that need to be tested. For example, density, aggre￾gate gradation, asphalt content, and smoothness for an asphalt pavement. 
3. Number of tests for each lot. 
4. Point of sampling for tests. For example, aggregates from stockpiles and belt. 
5. Method of sampling. For example, random sampling or representative sampling. 
ISTUDY 
 
 
 
 
 
 
422 Pavement Engineering 
6. Number of tests to be reported. For example, an average of fve tests should be reported. 
7. Test method to be used for each property. For example, the density of the HMA layer 
should be measured with a nuclear density gage test. 
8. The target value for each test property. For example, the target density is 95% of the labo￾ratory density. 
9. Tolerance of test results around the target value. 
10. Actions to be taken if specifcation requirements are not met. 
A good specifcation should be free of vague and confusing words (such as “aggregate should be 
clean or to the satisfaction of the engineer”). Some other examples of words that should be avoided 
are as follows: 
1. “. . . promptly and uniformly compacted . . .”—should state time of compaction or that 
before the temperature drops to a certain value compaction should be completed. 
2. “. . . heavy equipment or rollers . . .”—should state minimum weight of the roller. 
An example of a specifcation for density of the HMA, including all of these features, can be 
written as follows. 
The lot size of the construction for density evaluation is 1 day of production. The property to be 
tested is density. The lot will be divided into four equal sublots, and one random sample should be 
taken from each sublot. The in-place density should be measured. A 4 in. diameter core will be taken 
at each location. Use one test for each sample. Use ASTM D 2000 for determination of density. The 
average of the four core samples shall be 98%–100% of laboratory density. When the density is 
below 98%, the contractor will be paid at the percentage shown in Table 13.2.

13.6.1 VARIABILITY OF MATERIALS 
Test results are always variable because of errors of sampling and testing as well as material vari￾ability. Material variability will always be there, but the errors due to sampling and testing can be 
minimized by following specifed methods of sampling and using competent and qualifed testing 
personnel and appropriate testing equipment. 
The variability of a number of test properties, such as density, can be approximated by a normal 
distribution. Using the different parameters, as listed in the following, allows the determination of 
variability of materials and making decisions regarding acceptance or rejection in quality control 
and assurance.

Typical standard deviation values have been determined as shown in Table 13.3. 
In many specifcations, the evaluation of a job for acceptance or rejection is based on the percent 
within limits (PWL) of results for each lot of the pavement. PWL (or percent conforming) is defned 
as the percentage of the lot falling above the lower specifcation limit (LSL), beneath the upper 
specifcation limit (USL), or between the USL and LSL. Although tests can be applied to verify it, in 
general, the population of most test results is assumed to be normally distributed, and the use of this 
procedure ensures the consideration of both average and variability of the test results for evaluation 
of the “quality” of the product. The PWL concept is based on the use of the area under a standard 
normal distribution. 
A Z value, where Z = (y—μ)/σ, can be used to determine the percentage of population that is 
within or outside a certain limit, using Table 16.4. Note that Z is the statistic that is to be used 
with the table, Y is the point within which the area is determined from the table, and μ and σ are 
the mean and standard deviation of the population, respectively. For example, consider the fol￾lowing test results for an in-place density measurement (as a percentage of theoretical maximum 
density).

Now, in the case of the PWL procedure, the quality index value, Q, is used in instead of Z, and 
the sample mean, x , and sample standard deviation, s, are used instead of the population mean and 
standard deviations. Also, instead of the “Y” value used for the calculation of Z, the USL and LSL 
values are used, as follows: 
QL ˜ x ° LSL
s
USL ° x QU ˜ s
where 
QL is the quality index for lower specifcation limit, used when there is a one-sided lower specif￾cation limit 
QU is the quality index for upper specifcation limit, used when there is a one-sided upper specif￾cation limit 
LSL is the lower specifcation limit 
USL is the upper specifcation limit 
is the sample mean 
s is the sample standard deviation 
The use of the quality index is illustrated through the following example. Consider the in-place 
density data as follows: 
n = number of samples = 10 
x = sample mean = 97.5% of density of samples compacted by the Marshall procedure in the 
laboratory 
S = sample standard deviation = 1.25 
The specifcation states that in order to get 100% paid, 90% of the test results should be above 
96.3% of density of the samples compacted by the Marshall procedure in the laboratory. That is, a 
90% PWL is required for 100% pay. In this case, can the contractor expect 100% pay?

83%, which is less than 90%. Hence, the contractor cannot expect to get paid 100% of the pay for 
the lot being tested. 
Note that when two-sided specifcations are used, the PWL is calculated as follows: 
PWLT = PWLU + PWLL − 100 
where 
PWLU is the percentage below the upper specifcation limit (based on QU) 
PWLL is the percentage above the upper specifcation limit (based on QL) 
PWLT is the percentage within the upper and lower specifcation limits 
Generally, pay adjustments, on the basis of pay factors, are made on the basis of the PWL of a lot. 
It is desirable that the pay factors are tied to the quality and resulting performance of the pavement 
on a rational basis. Generally, payments are reduced for substandard work and increased (above

shown in an example in Table 13.6.

PF is the payment factor as a percentage of contract price

13.6.2 USE OF QUALITY CONTROL CHARTS 
During construction, it is important to summarize and analyze the test results. A quality control chart 
is a plot of test results and numbers. The control chart can be used to summarize the data, identify 
trends, show specifcation limits and percentages within limits, and evaluate changes in any process. 
Different data sets can be shown in quality control charts: 
1. Plot of individual values: The advantage is that it shows all the data, and the disadvantage 
is that it is diffcult to identify trends. 
2. Plot of running average: It shows trends but does not show actual data. 
3. Plot of running variability: It shows the variability of the mix. 
Typical test properties that are plotted include the density and water content for the subgrade; the 
density, water content, and gradation for the subbase and base; and the gradation, asphalt content, 
in-place density, laboratory density, and voids for the HMA. 
An example of a quality control chart for individual data values is shown in Figure 13.16.

13.7 PREPARATION OF SUBGRADE AND CONSTRUCTION 
OF BASE AND SUBBASE LAYERS 
The subgrade can consist of relatively high-quality materials such as sand and gravel or poor-quality 
materials such as silt and clay. The pavement structure is designed to protect the subgrade from 
excessive deformation. However, the subgrade may need improvement before pavement construc￾tion begins. The improvement is done with compaction and/or stabilization. 
Compaction can be measured by the nuclear density test, using a sand cone or a water balloon, or 
by testing samples recovered with cylinders. Density of the subgrade is specifed as a percentage of 
Proctor or modifed Proctor density or as a percentage of density of a control strip. The laboratory 
test data on optimum moisture content and maximum dry density are used. 
Low density in subgrade can be due to the following factors: 
1. Inadequate weight of rollers 
2. Unsatisfactory roller patterns 
3. Improper moisture content 
4. Incorrect laboratory density due to wrong compactive effort and/or use of nonrepresenta￾tive samples 
5. Poor testing, because of uncalibrated equipment or untrained personnel. 
The following tests could be run for characterizing the subgrade for performance: 
1. California bearing ratio (CBR) 
2. Plate bearing test 
3. Unconfned compression test 
4. Resilient modulus. 
Subbase and base materials generally consist of higher quality materials, such as clean, well-graded 
aggregates with fractured faces. Mixing is generally done in a portable pugmill with close con￾trol on water content. Subbase and base materials are placed using a grader, spreader, or paver. 
Compaction of the subbase and base can be accomplished using a static and/or vibratory steel-wheel 
roller as well as rubber-tired rollers. Potential problems with the base and subbase include low den￾sity, segregation, grade control, and gradation of aggregates. 
13.8 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
An important part of the production process is the testing of plant-produced material as part of the 
quality control (QC) methods. QC sampling and testing are done on a regular basis to continuously 
evaluate the produced material by the material producer. The results of the QC process can be fed 
back to the plant to correct or modify any setting as required. Quality assurance (QA) tests are gen￾erally conducted by the owner or a consultant agency (or sometimes even by the producer) at longer 
time intervals to make sure that the produced material meets the specifcation. 
The important tests and methods are presented in the following: 
1. Standard test method for random sampling (ASTM 3665): This standard outlines the pro￾cess that can be used to eliminate bias during sampling. Sampling can be done either by 
random procedure or stratifed random procedure. In the latter process, the lot is divided 
into sublots and then the random method is used to pick samples from each sublot. Tables 
for picking random numbers, by selecting any two numbers and rows and columns, are 
provided in ASTM 3665. Sampling should be done from different points, for example, 
aggregates from a belt or truck or from in-place paving material. 
ISTUDYConstruction of Asphalt Pavements 429 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Checking temperature of asphalt, HMA, and air: HMA and asphalt temperatures are 
measured using dial or digital type thermometers (two thermometers) made with metal 
stems (which are inserted into the material) and armored glass. AASHTO T 245 speci￾fes the requirements of the thermometers, which must be calibrated before use. Infrared 
thermometers, when calibrated against conventional thermometers, could be used. HMA 
temperatures are generally taken for each sample as well as at the start of the day, by 
pushing the stem to its full depth into the material and waiting for 3 min or when there is 
no appreciable temperature difference between two readings at 1 min intervals. The same 
type of thermometer could be used to check the temperature of the asphalt binder from 
sampling valves from the asphalt tank. For measuring air temperature, the thermometer 
should be kept out of direct sunlight. 
3. Preparing Marshall hammer compacted specimens: AASHTO T 245 specifes the pro￾cedure for compacting specimens with a Marshall hammer and testing the specimens for 
stability and fow after running bulk-specifc gravity (AASHTO T 166). The bulk-specifc 
gravity could be used along with the theoretical maximum density to determine the per￾centage of density and air voids. 
4. Preparing a specimen with a Superpave gyratory compactor: AASHTO 312 specifes the 
method for using a Superpave gyratory compactor for the compaction of 150 mm diam￾eter HMA specimens for subsequent determination of bulk-specifc gravity. 
5. Determination of bulk-specifc gravity of a compacted HMA specimen: AASHTO T 166 
specifes the procedure for the determination of bulk-specifc gravity of a laboratory￾compacted HMA specimen and in-place cores from pavement. Note that cores should be 
dried at 110°C to constant mass before running this test. 
6. Maximum specifc gravity of HMA: AASHTO T 209 specifes the method for determination 
of maximum specifc gravity of HMA specimens by determining the ratio of the weight of 
a void that is less than the mass of HMA and the mass of an equal volume of water. 
7. Determination of thickness of HMA specimen: ASTM D 3549 specifes the method of 
determination of thickness of a compacted HMA specimen. The devices that can be used 
are metal tape, a rule, a measurement jig, and a set of calipers. Required accuracy for 
measurements is specifed in the standard. Measurements are made between the horizon￾tal planes of the upper and lower surfaces of the specimens or between lines of demarca￾tion (as in a thickness of a layer inside a full-depth core). The measurements are taken at 
four different points around the periphery, and the average of the four numbers is reported 
as the thickness of the specimen. 
8. Determination of asphalt content of HMA by ignition method (AASHTO T 308): In this 
test, an HMA sample (generally ranging in weight from 1.2 to 4 kg, for a range of nomi￾nal maximum aggregate size [NMAS] of 4.75–37.5 mm) is weighed, it is placed inside an 
oven maintained at 650°C, the asphalt binder is burned off, the remaining aggregates are 
weighed, and the asphalt content is determined on the basis of the two weights. Aggregate 
calibration information, which accounts for loss of aggregates by burning, if any, can be 
input in the ignition oven computer. The ignition oven reports the weight of the sample 
to the nearest 0.1 g, taking into consideration the temperature correction, and prints out 
the asphalt content (using an onboard computer program) from the pre-ignition and post￾ignition weights and taking the aggregate calibration factor into consideration. Important 
items to have are provision of methods for reducing furnace emissions, availability of a 
self-locking oven door (which will not open until the end of the test), an audible alarm and 
lights for indication of completion of the test, as well as safety equipment such as a face 
shield and thermal gloves for the operator. The asphalt-free aggregates can be used for 
running a sieve analysis and checking gradation, although care must be taken to consider 
the breakdown of some aggregates and the creation of some fnes (if any) during the igni￾tion test of some types of aggregates.

430 Pavement Engineering 
9. Determination of asphalt content by the nuclear method (AASHTO T 287): In this test 
the amount of asphalt is indicated by the amount of hydrogen in a mix as measured with 
a neutron source in the nuclear gage. The gage needs to be calibrated with both aggregate 
and mix samples before using. A pan flled with consolidated HMA is placed inside the 
nuclear gage, and the asphalt content is read off the equipment. 
10. Quantitative extraction of asphalt from HMA (AASHTO T 164): In this test, a solvent 
is used to dissolve the asphalt binder out from an HMA sample, and the aggregates are 
recovered. The weight of the mix sample before and after the washing out of the asphalt 
is used to calculate the asphalt content, and the recovered aggregates can be used for sieve 
analysis. A special bowl is used to soak a specifed amount of mix (ranging in weight 
from 0.5 to 4 kg, for an NMAS of 4.75 to 37.5 mm) in a solvent. A flter ring is placed 
on the base of the bowl, and the lid is clamped down. A centrifuge is used to spin the 
sample in the bowl at a speed of 3600 rpm (slowly increasing the speed to the maximum). 
The extraction fuid is run off the bowl, and the process is continued with fresh charges 
of solvent until all of the asphalt has been washed away. At the end of this step, the fnes 
adhering to the flter paper can be scraped out on the remaining aggregate sample. The 
flter paper and the sample are then dried at 110°C to constant mass. 
11. Resistance of a compacted HMA specimen to moisture-induced damage (AASHTO T 283) 
as discussed in Chapter 12. 
13.9 CONSTRUCTION OF LONGITUDINAL JOINTS 
A longitudinal construction joint occurs when a lane of HMA is constructed adjacent to previously 
placed HMA. Longitudinal joints are inevitable in both highway and airfeld pavements, unless pav￾ing is done in the echelon formation (which is generally not the case). Damaged longitudinal joints 
are of very serious concern in airfeld pavements. Loose materials from such areas can cause foreign 
object debris (FOD) and cause damage to aircrafts, leading to loss of life and equipment. Potential 
sharp edges along open longitudinal joints can also endanger the aircrafts. In addition, such joints 
can lead to ingress of moisture and undesirable materials and lead to premature failures in the sub￾surface and ultimately the entire pavement, leading to a cycle of costly and time-consuming repairs. 
For these reasons, engineers, consultants, and contractors have continuously tried to develop methods 
for constructing better performing longitudinal joints in pavements. Such methods include overlapping 
and luting operations; different types of rolling patterns for compacting the joint; and the use of special 
joint construction techniques and equipment, such as cutting wheels, restrained edge devices, notched 
wedge joints, and joint heaters. At the same time, many agencies have started using specifcations that 
are written specifcally for the construction of better joints, such as density requirements at joints. 
There are several steps in the construction of a good-quality joint. These include paving the frst 
lane in a uniform, unwavering line; compacting the unsupported edge of the frst lane (cold lane) 
properly; controlling the height of the uncompacted HMA in the hot lane; and proper overlapping 
during the paving operation. Raking or luting at the longitudinal joint can be eliminated if minimal 
overlapping is done. An excessive overlap will require the removal of extra material from the cold 
lane onto the hot lane; otherwise, the aggregate in the mix remaining on the compacted lane will get 
crushed which would result in raveling. When that happens, the excessive overlapped material on 
the cold lane may be “bumped” with a lute onto the hot mat just across the joint. The bump should 
lie just above the natural slope or the wedge at the edge of the cold lane. Sometimes, there is a ten￾dency to broadcast the raked material onto the HMA in the hot lane. This not only is undesirable for 
obtaining a good longitudinal joint but also affects the surface texture of the mat adversely. 
Obtaining adequate compaction at the joint is the fnal key to obtaining a durable longitudinal 
joint. Joints with high densities generally show better performance than those with relatively low 
densities. By paying attention to construction details, it is possible to obtain a joint density within 
1.5% of the mainline density. 
ISTUDYConstruction of Asphalt Pavements 431 
 
 
 
Using proper specifcations is another key requirement for obtaining good-quality joints. Joint 
density is best measured by obtaining a 6 in. (150 mm) diameter core centered on top of the visible 
line between the two lanes. It is recommended to make the compaction level at both the joint and 
mat based on theoretical maximum density (TMD) rather than the bulk-specifc gravity of a daily 
compacted Marshall specimen, which is more variable. 
Section 401–5.2 of Engineering Brief EB59A of the FAA, dated May 12, 2006, provides a good 
example of a specifcation of constructing longitudinal joints. The acceptance criteria are as follows. 
Evaluation for acceptance of each lot of in-place pavement for joint density and mat density shall 
be based on PWL. The contractor shall target production quality to achieve 90 PWL or higher. 
The percentage of material within specifcation limits (PWL) shall be determined in accordance with 
procedures specifed in Section 110 of the General Provisions. The acceptance limits shall be as follows: 
Mat density, % of TMD 92.8 minimum 
Joint density, % of TMD 90.5 minimum 
13.9.1 TECHNIQUES OF CONSTRUCTING GOOD LONGITUDINAL JOINTS 
It is preferable to produce hot longitudinal joints by operating two or more pavers in echelon. If 
echelon paving is not possible, then any of the following good techniques can be used (Figure 13.17). 
13.9.1.1 Combination of Notched Wedge Joint, Rubberized Asphalt 
Tack Coat, and Minimum Joint Density Requirements 
Construct a notched wedge longitudinal joint. The unconfned edge of the frst paved lane has a vertical 
notch at the edge generally ranging from 1/2 in. (13 mm) to 3/4 in. (19 mm) in height depending upon 
the nominal maximum aggregate size of the HMA mixture. Generally, a vertical notch of about 1/2in.

432 Pavement Engineering 
(13mm) height is considered adequate for most surface course mixtures. It is recommended to end 
the taper with a minimal height such as 3/8 in. (9.5mm) to avoid dragging of the material. Usually a 
loaded wheel, which is attached to the paver, is used to compact the taper. Typically, the roller weighs 
100–200lb (45–91 kg) and is approximately 14in. (356mm) wide by 12in. (305mm) in diameter. 
There is no need to compact the taper with a conventional steel or pneumatic tired roller because it 
will simply destroy the vertical notch. The overlap layer of the adjacent paving lane is required to be 
placed and compacted within 24h unless delayed by inclement weather. The vertical notch and taper 
are tack-coated with rubberized asphalt binder prior to placing the overlap wedge, as described later. 
The notched wedge joint can be formed by using a homemade sloping steel plate or commercial 
devices attached to the inside corner of the paver screed extension. The notched wedge joint does not 
always work well for thinner HMA lifts. Ideally, it gives the best results with a minimum lift thickness 
of 1½–2 in. (37–51 mm). On the other hand, excessively thick lifts produce a long taper, which may 
not be desirable. In those cases, the length of the taper is generally restricted to 12 in. (305 mm). The 
top-course taper shall overlap and slope in the opposite direction of the lower-course taper. 
After the frst lane (cold lane) is paved with a notched wedge and compacted, a rubberized asphalt 
tack coat is applied on the face of the unconfned edge of the cold lane. The thickness of the tack coat 
is about 1/8 in. (3mm) on the slope of the HMA edge. The rubberized asphalt tack coat need not be 
applied on the entire taper. It is considered adequate to apply it on the vertical notch and the top 3–4 
in. (76–102mm) wide band of the taper. Application excesses should not exceed more than 1/2in. 
(13mm) at the top of the joint. The sealant should preferably be applied within 4h of the time that 
the adjacent HMA lane is placed. The heat from the HMA in the adjacent lane and the roller pressure 
causes the sealant to adhere strongly along the joint face, resulting in a strong bond between the two 
lanes and providing a built-in sealer at the joint. After the rubberized asphalt tack coat is applied, 
the adjacent lane (hot lane) is placed. The height of the uncompacted HMA should be about 1¼in. 
(32mm) for each 1 in. (25mm) of the compacted lift thickness in the cold lane. The end gate of the 
paver should extend over the top surface of the previously placed HMA by a distance of approxi￾mately 1–1½in. (25–38mm) unless there is an existing vertical face, in which case the overlap should 
be 1/2in. (13mm). The most effcient joint compaction method is to roll the longitudinal joint from 
the hot side, overlapping the cold lane by approximately 6in. (150mm). The steel-wheel roller can 
be operated in vibratory or static mode, preferably the vibratory mode to obtain better compaction. 
For the following procedures, the best practices for paving and compacting the frst lane, paving 
the second lane, and overlapping, raking and luting, and compacting the longitudinal joint, as well 
as minimum joint density and mat density requirements, are similar to those mentioned earlier. 
13.9.1.2 Rubberized Asphalt Tack Coat and Minimum Joint Density Requirements 
This practice is similar to that in Section 13.9.1.1 except that no notched wedge joint is used. The 
frst lane (cold lane) is paved as usual with the normal, unconfned edge slope. A rubberized asphalt 
tack coat is applied on the entire face of the unconfned edge of the cold lane using the procedure 
described earlier. 
13.9.1.3 Notched Wedge Joint and Minimum Joint Density Requirements 
This practice is similar to that in Section 13.9.1.1 except that a conventional tack coat material 
(which is used on the main line) is applied to the entire face of the notched wedge joint in lieu of 
rubberized asphalt material. 
13.9.1.4 Cutting Wheel and Minimum Joint Density Requirements 
The cutting wheel technique involves cutting 1.5–2.0in. (38–51mm) of the unconfned, low-density 
edge of the frst paved lane after compaction while the mix is plastic. The cutting wheel is usually 
10in. (254mm) in diameter, with the cutting angle about 10° from the vertical toward the mat to be 
cut and about 45° on the open side to push the trimmings away. The cutting wheel can be mounted on

an intermediate roller or a motor grader. The HMA trimmings can be collected and recycled. A rea￾sonably vertical face at the edge is obtained by this process, which is then tack-coated before placing 
the abutting HMA. It is important to restrict the overlap to about 1/2 in. (13 mm) while placing the 
adjacent lane, and remove all low-density material at the edge of the frst paved lane. Some contrac￾tors remove as much as a 3 in. (75 mm) strip to meet and exceed joint density requirements. It is very 
important to have a skilled cutting wheel operator, who must cut straight without wavering, and a 
skilled paver operator, who must closely match the cut line with minimal overlap. 
13.9.1.5 Infrared Joint Heating and Minimum Joint Density Requirements 
The objective of the infrared joint heating system is to obtain a hot joint during conventional longi￾tudinal joint construction. The infrared joint heating system consists of two or three preheaters and 
one paver-mounted heater. The preheaters, which are connected in series, are towed with a small 
tractor over the joint approximately 100 ft (30 m) ahead of the paver. Propane cylinders are used to 
feed the infrared heaters. Both the preheaters and paver-mounted heaters are placed about 2–3 in. 
(51–76 mm) above the pavement surface and straddle the joint. The infrared heaters usually target 
a fnal surface temperature of 340°F (171°C) behind the paver-mounted heater. The target surface 
temperature can be achieved by changing the number of preheaters, the distance between the pre￾heaters and paver, and the height of the heaters above the pavement surface. All these variables need 
to be adjusted, taking into account prevailing ambient conditions such as air temperature and wind 
velocity. The preheaters run continuously as long as the towing vehicle is operated at a speed high 
enough to prevent overheating the HMA at the joint. If the towing vehicle slows down too much, the 
preheater is designed to shut down automatically. The paver-mounted heater has also been designed 
to shut down once the HMA at the joint exceeds a specifed temperature.

Concrete Fundamentals 14 for Rigid Pavements 
14.1 CONCRETE 
Portland cement concrete (PCC) is the most commonly used construction material in the world. 
Approximately half of all PCC used in the United States is consumed in the construction of PCC 
pavements. 
The constituents of PCC include coarse aggregates (natural stone or crushed rock), fne 
aggregate (natural and manufactured sand), Portland cement, water, and mineral or chemical 
admixtures. The paste phase is made up of the Portland cement, water, and air (entrapped and 
entrained). The paste phase is the glue or bonding agent that holds the aggregates together. The 
mortar phase is the combination of paste and fne aggregate. Aggregates occupy approximately 
60%–75% of the total volume of the concrete. The aggregates should be well graded to effciently 
utilize the paste. It is desirable that each aggregate particle is coated with paste. The quality of 
the concrete is therefore highly dependent on the quality of the paste, the aggregates, and the 
interface or bond between the two. 
The quality of the hardened concrete is strongly infuenced by the quality of the paste, which in 
turn is highly dependent on the amount of water used in mixing the concrete. Therefore, the water￾to-cement ratio by mass (W/C) is an important parameter that relates to many concrete qualities 
(Abrams, 1919). Excessive amounts of mix water (a higher W/C ratio) will increase the porosity, 
lower the strength (compressive, tensile, and fexural), increase the permeability and lower water 
tightness and durability to aggressive chemicals, decrease bond strength between concrete and rein￾forcement, and increase volume changes (more cracking) due to moisture changes (wetting and dry￾ing) and temperature changes. Therefore, it is important to use the least amount of water for mixing 
the concrete, provided that it can be placed and consolidated properly. Stiffer mixes with less water 
are more diffcult to work with; however, mechanical vibration is available for proper consolidation 
(ACI Committee 211, 1991). 
To produce a concrete that is strong, resists abrasion, and is watertight and durable, the follow￾ing sequence should be followed: proper proportioning, batching, mixing, placing, consolidating, 
fnishing, and curing. 
The ease of placing, consolidating, and fnishing concrete without segregation of the coarse 
aggregates from the mortar (paste and sand) phase is called workability. The degree of workability 
is highly dependent on the concrete type and method of placement and consolidation. Mechanical 
placement and consolidation can handle much stiffer mixes. Other properties related to workability 
include consistency, segregation, pumpability, bleeding, and fnishability. The slump test is used 
to measure consistency, which is closely related to workability. A low-slump concrete has a stiff 
consistency and may be diffcult to place and consolidate properly. However, if the mix is too wet, 
segregation or separation of large-size aggregates and honeycombing could occur. The consistency 
should be the driest that is most practical for placement using the available equipment (Powers, 
1932). 
Concrete mixtures with the larger aggregate size and a continuous gradation will have less space 
to fll with paste and less aggregate surface area to coat with paste; therefore, less cement and water 
are needed. Stiffer mixtures usually result in improved quality and economy, granted the concrete 
is properly consolidated (ACI Committee 211, 1991).

14.2 AGGREGATES 
Aggregates should be of suffcient quality with adequate strength, soundness, and environmental 
durability so as not to negatively impact the performance of the hardened concrete. The larger por￾tions of crushed rock, stone, and sand are called coarse aggregate with sizes larger than the No. 4 
sieve (4.75 mm). Fine aggregate is natural sand or crushed rock that has a particle size smaller than 
the No. 4 sieve. 
For concrete pavements subject to cycles of freezing and thawing, aggregate and cement paste 
durability is critical to the pavement performance. For aggregates, the frost resistance is related to the 
porosity, absorption, permeability, and pore structure. If an aggregate particle absorbs enough water 
to reach critical saturation, then the pore structure is not able to accommodate the hydraulic pres￾sures associated with the freezing of water. If enough inferior aggregates are present in the concrete, 
concrete distress and disintegration may occur. If the problem aggregate particles are present at the 
surface, popouts can occur. Popouts appear as conical breaks that are removed from the concrete 
surface. 
Cracking of concrete pavements caused by freeze-thaw deterioration of the aggregate within 
the concrete is called D-cracking (see Figure 10.2). The visual distress of D-cracking resembles 
the letter D, where closely spaced cracks emerge parallel to the transverse and longitudinal joints 
and progress outward toward the center of the slab. Assessing aggregates for freeze-thaw durabil￾ity can be done by past performance or by laboratory testing of concrete. The freeze-thaw test￾ing of concrete (ASTM C 666, AASHTO T 161) involves conditioning concrete beams through 
cycles of freeze-thaw (freeze in air and thaw in water, or freeze and thaw in water), and testing 
for dynamic modulus of the beam before and after conditioning. If the conditioned modulus 
falls below 60% of the unconditioned modulus, then the mix is not accepted. Other tests include 
resistance to weathering using immersion cycles in sodium or magnesium sulfate solutions. Salt 
crystal growth in the aggregate pores creates a pressure similar to the hydraulic pressure from 
freezing water. A rapid pressure-release test developed by Janssen and Snyder (1994) has also 
been correlated to D-cracking potential. In this test, aggregates are placed in a high-pressure 
chamber. The pressure is released rapidly, and unsound aggregates with ineffective pore struc￾tures fracture. 
14.3 CEMENT 
Portland cements are hydraulic cements that chemically react with water to produce calcium sili￾cate hydrates, which are considered to be the glue that gives PCC its strength. Portland cement 
is produced by combining raw material (or feed) containing calcium, silica, alumina, and iron 
compounds. Appropriate amounts of this raw feed are combined in pulverized or slurry form and 
sintered or burned in an inclined rotary kiln. (Figure 14.1 shows a schematic of the cement produc￾tion process.) 
The raw feed is introduced into the kiln, and as the kiln rotates, the materials will slide down 
the kiln at a slow rate. The kiln temperature ranges from approximately 200°C at the entry to 
1450°C at the exit and burner location. Table 14.1 shows the clinkering (solid solution) reactions 
FIGURE 14.1 Schematic of cement production process. 
ISTUDYConcrete Fundamentals for Rigid Pavements 437 
in the kiln. At the end of the clinkering process, clinker nodules measuring 1–25 mm are pro￾duced. To produce Portland cement, the clinker and approximately 5% gypsum are combined 
and ground to a very fne powder averaging 15 μm in diameter (and a surface area of about 
300–600 m2/kg). 
Since the chemical equations for cement chemistry are long and complex, a shorthand (abbrevi￾ated) notation was developed and is in use today by cement and concrete technologists, as shown 
in Table 14.2. 
A clinker chemical analysis is typically given in oxide form, as shown in Table 14.3. From the 
chemical analysis, the quantity of each of the four main minerals (C3A, C4AF, C3S, and C2S) may 
be calculated using the “Bogue” equations (Taylor, 1997). 
Clinker contains four main compounds that constitute over 90% of Portland cement. Table 14.4 
shows the compound name, the approximate chemical formula (note: cement chemistry stoichiometry

14.3.1 TYPES OF PORTLAND CEMENT 
There exist many different types of Portland cements in the world to meet the needs for specifc pur￾poses. Manufactured Portland cements usually meet the specifcations of ASTM C 150 (Standard 
Specifcations for Portland Cement), AASHTO M 85 (Specifcation for Portland Cement), or 
ASTM 1157 (Performance Specifcation for Hydraulic Cements). ASTM C 150 provides standards 
for eight different Portland cements, as shown in Table 14.5. 
Type I: General-purpose cement suitable for all uses where special properties or other cement 
types are not required. 
Type II: Used where precaution against moderate sulfate attack is warranted. Type II cements 
should be specifed where water-soluble sulfate (SO4) in soil is between 0.1% and 0.2% or the con￾centration of SO4 in water is between 150 and 1500 ppm. The moderate sulfate resistance of Type 
II cement is due to its limited C3A content (< 8%). Sulfate degradation of hydrated Portland cement 
is due to the formation of additional ettringite when external sulfate is introduced. Additional for￾mation of ettringite and other calcium aluminate products in the paste may cause cracking and 
degradation of the concrete. 
Type III: Provides higher strength at an early age (1 week or less) compared to Types I and II. 
The strength is comparable to that of Type I in the long term (months and years). Type III cement is 
chemically similar to Type I; however, it is ground much fner. The increase in surface area allows 
for more reaction contact sites between the cement and water and, therefore, results in a faster 
hydration product formation. 
Type IV: Used where the rate and amount of heat generated from hydration must be minimized. 
Strength rate development is much lower than in other types. This type of cement is specially 
ordered and is not readily available. 
Type V: Used where precaution against severe sulfate exposure is warranted. Type V cements 
should be specifed where the water-soluble sulfate (SO4) in soil is greater than 0.2% or the 
concentration of (SO4) in water is greater than 1500 ppm. The high sulfate resistance of Type V 
cement is due to its limited C3A content (< 5%). The sulfate degradation mechanism is similar 
to that for Type II cement. ASTM C 150 and AASHTO M 85 allow both chemical and physical 
standards to assure the sulfate resistance of Type V cement. However, only one approach may be 
specifed but not both. ASTM C 452 is used to assess the potential expansion of mortar specimens 
exposed to sulfate.

14.4 WATER 
Potable water without any pronounced taste or odor is suitable for making PCC. If the water is not 
potable, it can also be used if the 7 day compressive strength of mortar cubes with this water is at 
least 90% of the 7 day compressive strength of mortar cubes made with distilled water (ASTM C 
109 and AASHTO T 106). The suitability of the water can also be checked using tests for setting 
time of the cement according to ASTM C 191 and AASHTO T 131. 
14.5 HYDRATION 
Cement reacts with water to form a hydration product that is the basis for the “glue” that gives 
hydrated Portland cement its bonding characteristics. This is a chemical reaction that involves four 
main cement compounds: tricalcium silicate, dicalcium silicate, tricalcium aluminate, and tetracal￾cium aluminate-ferrite. 
When water is added to cement and mixed together, the reaction is exothermic, and heat is gen￾erated. Monitoring the rate of heat generation produced is a good indicator of the rate of reaction 
of Portland cement compounds. An illustrative example of the heat evolution curve produced by 
cement using a calorimeter (ASTM C 186) is shown in Figure 14.2. It shows the stages of heat evolu￾tion during Portland cement hydration as determined by a calorimeter. 
As water is added to cement, some of the clinker sulfates and gypsum dissolve, producing an alka￾line and sulfate-rich solution. The C3A phase reacts vigorously with water to form an aluminate-rich 
gel (stage 1 in Figure 14.2). The gel reacts with the sulfates in solution to form small rodlike crystals of 
ettringite (see Figure 14.3). The hydration of C3A is a strongly exothermic reaction but only lasts a few 
minutes (approximately 7min) and is followed by a period of a few hours of relatively low heat evolu￾tion. This is called the dormant, or induction, period (stage 2). The frst part of the dormant period corre￾sponds to when concrete can be placed, and it lasts a couple of hours. As the dormant period progresses, 
the paste becomes stiff and unworkable. This period is related to initial set in concrete. 
At the end of the dormant period, the alite (C3S) and belite (C2S) compounds start to hydrate with 
the formation of calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) and calcium hydroxide (CH). This corresponds to 
the main period of cement hydration (stage 3), rate of strength increase, and fnal set for concrete. 
The cement grains react from the surface inward as water diffuses through layers of formed hydra￾tion product, and the anhydrous particles decrease in size. In stage 4, C3A hydration continues as 
well, as water diffuses through cement particles and newly exposed crystals become accessible to 
water. The rate of early strength gain is infuenced in this period. In addition, conversion of ettrin￾gite crystals to monosulfate aluminate crystals is also occurring. This peak occurs between 12 and 
90 h. In stage 5, the slow steady formation of hydration products establishes the rate of later strength. 
The ferrite compounds continue their slow hydration at this phase, although their contribution to

approximately between 12 and 20 h after mixing and then dissipates. For blended cements and the 
use of pozzolans such as fy ash, silica fume, and slag, the heat evolution periods may be different.

14.6 STEEL IN CONCRETE 
Steel-reinforcing bars (commonly known as rebar) are produced by pouring molten steel into cast￾ers and then running it through a series of stands in the mill. Most bars are deformed, which means 
that a raised pattern is rolled along the perimeter. The deformed ribs improve the bond between 
ISTUDYConcrete Fundamentals for Rigid Pavements 441 
the steel and the concrete and help transfer the loads between the two materials. Plain bars are also 
fabricated. Some are used for dowels, since at least one-half of a dowel bar should be smooth and 
lubricated to allow for free expansion and contraction. The specifcations for concrete rebar are 
given in the following ASTM standards. 
A615/A615M-05a: Standard Specifcation for Deformed and Plain Billet-Steel Bars for 
Concrete Reinforcement (covers grades 40 and 60/soft metric grades 420 and 520) 
A616: Standard Specifcation for Rail-Steel Deformed Bars for Concrete Reinforcement 
(covers grades 50 and 60) 
A617: Standard Specifcation for Axle-Steel Deformed Bars for Concrete Reinforcement 
(covers grades 40 and 60) 
A706/A706M-96b: Standard Specifcation for Low-Alloy-Steel Deformed and Plain Bars for 
Concrete Reinforcement (grade 60 only) 
The commonly used steel grades are given in Table 14.7. The allowable stress is usually given as 
two-thirds of the yield strength. 
The size designations (Table 14.8) are the number of eighths of an inch in the diameter of a plain 
round bar having the same weight per foot as the deformed bar. So, for example, a No. 6 bar would 
have the same mass per foot as a plain bar 6/8in. in diameter. The metric size is the same dimension 
expressed to the nearest millimeter. 
Table 14.9 shows steel type, yield strength (40–75 ksi, 300–520 MPa), and ASTM standards for 
the different types of steels used for reinforcement.

Welded wire mesh is steel wire welded together to form a fat sheet with a square grid pattern. 
A common grid size is 150× 150mm (6 in. × 6 in.), and a common steel wire thickness is 4mm 
(1/8in.). Wire fabric or bar mats are used in PCC slabs to control temperature cracking. The stresses 
developed in the concrete slab during these volume changes are mainly due to friction that develops. 
However, these reinforcements do not increase the structural capacity of the slab. The wire fabric 
aids in holding the cracked concrete pavement together and allows for load transfer through aggre￾gate interlock. Additionally, the reinforcement allows for greater spacing between joints.

Distress Models and 15 Material Characterization 
for Concrete Pavements 
The major distresses of concrete pavement against which the pavement is designed consist of crack￾ing, faulting, pumping, and punchouts. Degradation of smoothness and ride quality over time will 
severely affect the functionality of the pavement. These distresses are commonly caused by exces￾sive stresses, strains, and defections. The goal of the mechanistic-empirical (M-E) approach to 
pavement design is to reduce these stresses, strains, and defections, and maintain the pavement 
below a “critical” threshold to minimize deterioration and prevent failure. 
To prevent cracking, the stresses are limited by a certain value. Stresses develop as a combination 
of factors such as expansive stresses due to temperature and moisture changes, curling and warping, 
or fatigue stresses caused by repeated loading. To counter the cracking problem, some of the major 
test properties required are modulus of elasticity, the static and dynamic fexural strength, and coef￾fcients of thermal expansion. The tests are discussed in the second part of this chapter. 
Faulting is prevented by providing a stiff base with relatively low deformation under load. 
Minimizing curling and warping also helps in preventing faulting. Pumping is prevented by pro￾viding a free draining base, preventing moisture intrusion into the joints, and minimizing curling. 
Tests on fresh concrete are conducted for quality control and achieving consistency in the mix. The 
purposes are also to ensure good placement and fnishing of the concrete. 
Hence, the pavement design features that require the appropriate selection of slab thickness, base 
type and thickness, joint spacing, dowel design, and drainage, all contribute to reducing induced 
stresses, strains, and defections and minimizing observed distress. 
15.1 DISTRESSES AND MODELS 
15.1.1 CRACKING 
Cracking in concrete pavements can occur due to excessive static stresses or strains due to fatigue 
stress/strain failure. The high stresses that can cause cracking can be induced by a combination of 
factors, including restraint forces that are developed due to temperature and/or moisture volume 
changes that cause warping and curling and traffc loads. Figure 15.1 shows the defected pavement 
shape at the onset of cracking with a combination of attributes that contribute to cracking. 
15.1.1.1 Fatigue Cracking in JPCP 
For JPCP, contraction joints are provided at close intervals to prevent the development of mid-slab 
cracks resulting from excessive stresses induced by loading, temperature, and moisture changes. 
The consequences of these stresses are an accumulation of damage in a critical portion of the slab. 
Enough accumulated stress will eventually initiate cracking, and further propagation of cracks will 
manifest at the bottom or surface of the PCC slab over time. Depending on the critical factors 
involved in crack propagation, fatigue cracking in JPCP can be divided into four major categories: 
Bottom-up transverse cracks 
Top-down transverse cracks 
Longitudinal cracks 
Corner breaks

FIGURE 15.1 Defections in concrete pavement. 
Bottom-up transverse cracks occur when a critical combination of loading and temperature curl￾ing creates summative stresses. For example, when truck axles are applying loads near the lon￾gitudinal edge of a slab and midway between the transverse joints, a critical tensile bending 
stress occurs at the extreme bottom fber of the slab. This bending stress increases greatly when 
coupled with a positive thermal gradient that produces downward curling. The process initiates 
micro-cracks that eventually grow and propagate with repeated loading stresses that manifest 
into visible transverse cracks that affect the pavement performance. Bottom-up cracking models 
must therefore account for the accumulation of fatigue damage caused by every truck axle load 
within a specifed time increment, including appropriate thermal stresses and summed over the 
total design period. 
Top-down transverse cracks also occur when a critical combination of loading and temperature 
curling creates summative stresses. In this case, when the truck front axle (steering axle) approaches 
a transverse joint within 10–20 ft, a large tensile stress is induced in the top of the slab between 
axles. This top tensile stress increases greatly when there is a negative thermal gradient through the 
slab, a built-in negative gradient from the slab construction, or signifcant drying shrinkage at the 
top of the slab. Negative thermal gradient is defned when the top of the slab is cooler than the bot￾tom and upward curling occurs. Similar to the aforementioned case, repeated loading stresses will 
eventually manifest into visible transverse cracks that affect the pavement performance. Models for 
top-down transverse cracks should account for similar stresses as presented for bottom-up trans￾verse cracks. 
Longitudinal cracks and corner breaks also occur due to combined stresses. The mechanism 
for this type of distress is similar to that of top-down transverse cracking except for the location of 
the critical stresses that develop. The critical induced stresses occur along both the longitudinal and 
transverse joints but near the corner. 
Assessment of damage accumulation is essential for structural design to properly consider all 
the different load magnitudes that are applied to highway pavements. The fatigue damage concept 
as presented by Miner (1945) allows the designer to sum the fatigue damage from different loads of 
various magnitudes and to compute the resulting combined fatigue damage, as shown next: 
p nijk Fatigue damage ˜ °ijk ˜1 Nijk
where 
nijk is the number of actual load applications under conditions represented by i, j, and k 
Nijk is the number of allowable load applications under conditions represented by i, j, and k 
The subscripts i, j, and k represent factors such as PCC strength and modulus, load, axle type, tempera￾ture gradient, location of applied load, and k, among others. PCC pavements almost never fail due to a 
ISTUDYDistress Models and Material Characterization for Concrete 445 
single application of load. Field and laboratory experience has shown that fatigue failure of PCC slabs 
and beams occurs due to repeated fexural stresses. Representative modeling of fatigue stresses should 
include more than loading, and this includes critical fatigue location, critical traffc load stresses, criti￾cal curling and warping stresses, seasonal variation in support, load transfer, warping and curling, 
concrete strength over time, and appropriate use of the concept of accumulated damage. 
Based on numerous published data, it has been observed that the concrete will not reach failure 
by fatigue if the stress ratio (applied stress divided by maximum fexural stress) is less than 50% 
after approximately 20 million cycles or repetitions (Mindess and Young, 1981; Neville, 1981). 
Since concrete continues to gain strength with age, the fexural strength of normal concrete 
reaches only about 70% of its long-term potential strength at 28days and approximately 90% at 
90days. Based on Wood (1991), a 20% increase in fexural strength above the 28day strength can 
be used for analysis purposes. 
Fatigue damage in PCC pavements can be determined using Miner’s equation when the allow￾able number of load repetitions is known. Various models have been developed to determine the 
allowable number of load repetitions as a function of the stress ratio (σ/Sc). These models are pre￾sented next. 
15.1.1.2 Zero-Maintenance Design Fatigue Model 
The zero-maintenance design model presents the relationship between the number of stress appli￾cations to failure and the stress ratio in JPCP. The model was developed by Darter and Barenberg 
(1976, 1977), and is presented in the following equation: 
˛  ˆ logNf ˜ 17 61. °17.61˙ ˘ ˝ Sc ˇ
where 
N is the number of stress applications 
(σ/Sc) is the stress ratio 
σ is the applied cyclic stress 
Sc is the maximum static fexural strength 
This relationship represents a 50% probability of failure, which is too high a risk for design purposes. 
Another equation was later developed that reduced the probability of failure to 24%. Developing 
an expression with a lower probability of failure in fatigue life was not possible due to the inherent 
variation in strength: 
˛  ˆ logNf ˜ 16 61. °17.61˙ ˘ ˝ Sc ˇ
15.1.1.3 Calibrated Mechanistic Design Fatigue Model 
This model was developed from data obtained from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ full-scale 
accelerated traffc tests and from the AASHTO Road Test. The model presents the relationship 
between the number of edge stress repetitions, the stress ratio, and the probability level (P) as pre￾sented by Salsilli et al. (1993):

The PCA fatigue model is similar to the zero-maintenance model. However, the PCA model assumes 
that no fatigue failure will occur below a stress ratio of 45% even at an infinite number of cycles.

15.1.1.9 Transverse Cracking 
Transverse cracks occur in both JPCP and JRCP. The cracking mechanism is, however, different 
for each type. Transverse cracks in JPCP are commonly caused by thermal curling or fatigue 
loading induced by traffc loads. However, transverse cracks in JRCP are commonly caused 
by thermal curling and shrinkage. As described in the previous section, the incremental dam￾age induced by traffc and environmental conditions is converted to physical pavement distress 
such as transverse cracks, longitudinal cracks, and corner breaks using a calibrated damage-to￾distress correlation model. Some of the models developed for predicting transverse cracking are 
presented next. 
15.1.1.9.1 Transverse Cracking Prediction Models 
15.1.1.9.1.1 Ripper The RIPPER model is based on a fatigue life depletion approach similar to 
the one used in the zero-maintenance design model. The maximum number of allowable repetitions 
˘
“N” was computed using fatigue damage. The cumulative fatigue damage (n/N) is then computed 
and plotted against the corresponding percentage of slabs cracked. The model is as follows:

15.1.1.9.1.2 Ripper 2 This model is the follow-up to RIPPER and was developed by Yu et al. 
(1998) from the largest national-scale PCC pavement performance study. The approach was similar 
to that of RIPPER. In addition, the effect of wander was given more emphasis. A ratio termed the 
pass-to-coverage (p/c) ratio was defned, which gives the number of traffc passes needed to pro￾duce the same amount of fatigue damage at the critical location as one pass that causes the critical 
loading condition (e.g., edge location). For example, if the (p/c) has a value of 100, this means that it 
takes 100 traffc passes to cause the same amount of damage as one load placed directly at the edge. 
The (p/c) is represented mathematically as follows: 
p FD ˜ Dii
c ° P(COV ) Dj FDDij
where 
FDDii is the fatigue damage at a location Di
 due to load at Dj 
P(COVDj) is the probability that the load will pass through location Dj 
FDDij is the fatigue damage at a location Di
 due to load at Dj 
ISTUDY 
448 Pavement Engineering 
The results from RIPPER 2 show that fatigue cracking is sensitive to slab thickness, joint spacing, 
and shoulder type. A reduction in fatigue cracking in JPCP is achievable by increasing the slab 
thickness and/or reducing the joint spacing. A tied PCC shoulder and wider slabs can signifcantly 
reduce the amount of slab cracking. A stabilized bonded base can also reduce slab cracking. Hotter 
climates can cause more cracking because of the greater temperature gradients induced in the slab. 
The fexural strength or modulus of rupture (MOR) of the PCC will affect cracking. A higher MOR 
will result in less slab cracking. The modulus of subgrade reaction has a minor role, except for 
extreme conditions. 
15.1.2 TRANSVERSE JOINT FAULTING IN JOINTED PLAIN CONCRETE PAVEMENTS 
Transverse joint faulting is the difference in elevation between adjacent slabs across a joint. Excessive 
faulting reduces the performance of JPCP by increasing roughness and user discomfort and result￾ing in ultimate cracking and corner breaks. Faulting is caused by the erosion beneath the leave slab 
and the buildup on the approach slab of base fnes by the action of pumping (Figure 15.2). For fault￾ing to occur, the right combination of factors must exist, and they include heavy axle loading, poor 
load transfer across joints, base materials that are erodible, and free water in the base (water is the 
medium to transport fnes under the slab). Faulting is commonly measured using a faultmeter (such 
as the Georgia Digital Faultmeter). 
Although it is commonly agreed upon that pumping is the basic mechanism that leads to 
faulting, other factors can still infuence faulting. Faulting increases in the cold months since 
joints open up due to PCC contraction and aggregate interlock is reduced. Joints with adequate 
dowel support increase joint load transfer and decrease faulting. However, if doweled joints are 
defcient or become so, faulting can result and has been observed in doweled joints. In addition, 
the base can usually have a higher moisture content that contributes to pumping. Conversely, in 
the warmer months the concrete expands, and the joints are tighter, which increases aggregate 
interlock. Upward curling can contribute to slab corner defection when subjected to heavy axle 
loads.

15.1.2.1 Models to Predict Faulting 
M-E faulting models tend to incorporate the following parameters that contribute to faulting: slab 
corner defections, base or subbase erodibility, and free water within the pavement structure. For 
example, a typical model is as follows: 
Fault = C1DEαERODβWTRγ
where 
Fault is the average joint faulting, in. (or total joint faulting per mile) 
DE is the factor representing slab corner defection 
EROD is the factor representing base/subbase erodibility 
WTR is the factor representing the amount and frequency of free water within the pavement system 
C1αβγ are the regression constants 
The models developed for faulting use mechanistic principles to predict slab corner defections; how￾ever, base or subbase erodibility and moisture conditions are estimated using empirical methods. 
15.1.2.2 Slab Corner Defections 
15.1.2.2.1 NAPCOM Approach 
The Purdue method for analysis of rigid pavements (PMARP) uses energy methods to determine 
the volume of materials pumped from beneath a loaded slab given a deformation energy induced 
by wheel loads: 
n
˝2 TE ˜ ˛ k Ai i i i°1
where 
TE is the deformation energy imposed by an axle load, psi/in. 
Ki is the modulus of subgrade reaction, psi/in. 
Ai is the area associated with node i, in.2 
Δi is the defection at node i, in. 
The deformed area under the loaded PCC slab with the potential for pumping is shown in 
Figure 15.3.

450 Pavement Engineering 
To model the energy that contributes to water movement under a slab, the differential deforma￾tion energy was defned as the difference in energy (pore water pressure) experienced at the inter￾face of adjacent slabs beneath the joint: 
DE = EL − EUL 
where 
DE is the differential elastic deformation energy per unit area between the loaded and the unloaded 
slab, kN/mm 
EL is the elastic deformation energy per unit area imposed on the loaded slab, KN/mm 
EUL is the elastic deformation energy imposed on the unloaded slab, kN/mm 
The expression for DE can be rewritten as follows: 
DE ˜ 1 k W˛ L ° W W UL ˝˛ L ˙ WUL ˝ 2
where the term (WL + WUL) is the differential defection between the loaded and unloaded slabs. 
The higher the difference, the higher the probability of movement of material from beneath the 
leave slab to beneath the approach slab. 
DE is used as the mechanistic parameter for computing the allowable number of axle load appli￾cations, N: 
logNijk = α1 − α2log (DE + 1) 
where 
Nijk is the allowable axle load repetitions of axle “type i” and load j for foundation condition k 
α1, α2 are the regression constants 
DE is the differential slab defection due to axle “type i” and load j for foundation condition k 
The damage due to repeated differential slab defections and pumping can be calculated using 
Miner’s damage equation: 
n
DAMAGEijk ˜ ° ijk
ijk Nijk
where 
DAMAGEijk is the damage for axle type i and load j for foundation condition k 
nijk is the expected number of axle load repetitions for each axle group i and load j for 
foundation condition k 
Nijk is the allowable number of repetitions for each axle group i and load j for foundation 
condition k to a maximum faulting 
15.1.2.2.2 PCA Model 
In the PCA model, erosion damage is related to power. Power is defned as the rate of work each 
axle pass over the PCC slab joint exerts on the underlying pavement base/subbase materials. The 
PCA defnes power exerted by each axle pass at the slab corner as the product of corner defection 
(w) and pressure (p) at the slab base-subbase interface divided by the length of the defection basin, 
which is a function of the radius of relative stiffness. The equation is as follows: 
ISTUDYDistress Models and Material Characterization for Concrete 451 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2 p P = 268 7.
hk0 7. 3
where 
P is the power (rate of work) 
p is the pressure at slab-foundation interface, psi 
h is the slab thickness, in. 
k is the modulus of subgrade reaction, psi/in. 
The allowable axle load repetitions for a given axle type and foundation condition can then be deter￾mined using the following: 
Nijk = 10(14.52−6.77[C1P –9]0.103) ijk 
where 
Nijk is the allowable number of axle load repetitions for axle type i and load j for foundation condi￾tion k 
C1 = 1 − (k/2000 × 4/h)2 (approximately equal to 1 for granular materials and 0.9 for high-strength 
non-erodible materials) 
P is the power of axle type i and load j for foundation condition k. 
Erosion damage can be calculated using Miner’s equation as follows: 
100C n2 ijk EROSIONijk ˜ °ijk Nijk
where 
EROSIONijk is the percentage of erosion damage for axle type i and load j for foundation condition k 
C2 is the 0.06 for pavements without a shoulder and 0.94 for pavements with a tied con￾crete shoulder 
n is the expected number of axle load repetitions for each axle group i and load j for ijk 
foundation condition k 
Nijk is the allowable number of repetitions for each axle group i and load j for foundation 
condition k to a maximum faulting 
15.1.2.2.3 Yao (1990) Model 
Prior to determining the number of repetitions to failure, the Foundation Damage Index is frst 
determined and is expressed as follows: 
W2
DI = 1 2. 7 hk
where 
DI is the Foundation Damage Index 
W is the corner defection, in. 
h is the pavement thickness, in. 
k is the modulus of subgrade reaction, psi/in. 
ISTUDY 
 
 
 
452 Pavement Engineering 
For DI > 1.862 × 10−4: 
0.5064 Nijk = 0.312 DIijk
where 
Nijk is the allowable number of repetitions for each axle group i and load j for foundation condition k 
DIijk is the defection index for axle type i and load j for foundation condition k 
For DI < 1.862 × 10−4: 
3 7. 5 1° 0˛22
Nijk ˜ 5.96 DIijk
Using Miner’s damage equation, the damage at a slab corner is as follows: 
n
DAMijk ˜ ° ijk
ijk Nijk
where 
DAMijk is the total damage for axle type i and load j for foundation condition k 
nijk is the expected number of axle load repetitions for each axle group i and load j for founda￾tion condition k 
Nijk is the allowable number of repetitions for each axle group i and load j for foundation condition k 
The damage calculated in Yao’s model may be used to assess the potential for erosion, pumping, 
and the loss of slab support due to void creation beneath the PCC slab. This damage index, however, 
was not correlated to feld faulting data to predict transverse joint faulting. Yao et al.’s model shows 
that corner defection could be used as a predictor for joint damage, erosion, and pumping that could 
ultimately induce transverse faulting. 
15.1.2.2.4 NCHRP 1-26 (RIPPER Model) 
This model was developed for transverse joint faulting in doweled jointed pavements. This was done 
since it is the belief that previously introduced joint-faulting models are not appropriate for doweled 
joints. Faulting in doweled joints is attributed to free vertical movement between the dowel and the 
contiguous or surrounding concrete. This can be attributed to excessive deformation of the concrete 
when its localized bearing strength is exceeded. The bearing stress between dowels and concrete 
has been introduced earlier and is presented here for completeness. 
Dowel defection is defned as follows: 
P ˛2 ° ˙z˝ D ˜ t
o 4 3 ˙ E Id d
where 
Do is the deformation of the dowel at the face of the joint 
Pt is the shear force acting on the dowel (load on one dowel) 
z is the joint width 
Ed is the modulus of elasticity of the dowel 
Id = πd4/64 is the moment of inertia of the dowel 
ISTUDYDistress Models and Material Characterization for Concrete 453 
Kd ˜ ° 4
4E Id d
The bearing stress σb is proportional to the deformation: 
KPt ˙2 ˝ °zˆ ˜ b o ˛ KD ˛ 3 4° E Id d
An estimation of the amount of load transferred by the dowel is commonly selected as 1,500,000 
psi/in. (as adopted by NCHRP 1-26). For the NCHRP 1-26 study, the critical pavement response 
parameter, which is the maximum bearing stress at the concrete dowel interface, was directly cor￾related with measured transverse joint faulting. 
15.1.2.2.5 Byrum et al. (1997) Model 
Byrum et al. developed a mechanistic-based transverse faulting model for nondoweled jointed 
pavement. This model is based on the NAPCOM and PCA approaches and coupled with thermal 
gradients and shrinkage to accentuate the faulting due to upward slab curvature. Byrum pro￾posed a curvature index to quantify the slab curvature due to thermal gradients and shrinkage. 
There was a good correlation between CI and transverse joint faulting. Hence, this approach 
may have a good potential for predicting joint pumping and faulting in the future (Byrum, 
1999): 
CI = 0.5(LCI + RCI) 
where 
CI is the slab curvature index 
LCI is the left curvature index 
RCI is the right curvature index 
Curvature is defned as follows: 
Slope ° Slope n+1 n Curvature ˜ Xn+1 ° Xn
where 
Curvature is the slab curvature for a given interval or segment 
Xn is the horizontal distance along a given slab 
Slope is defned as follows: 
Yn+1 ° Yn Slope ˜ Xn+1 ° Xn
where 
Slope is the slope along the slab surface for a given interval or segment 
Yn is the vertical elevation along a given slab 
Xn is the horizontal distance along a given slab

15.1.3 EROSION CHARACTERIZATION OF BASE/SUBBASE 
The erodibility of a base is an important factor contributing to the potential pumping and faulting 
that may occur. Understanding, measuring, and predicting foundation material erodibility is, there￾fore, critical for developing accurate pumping and faulting models. Many factors may contribute to 
quantifying erodibility; they include soil compaction, shearing, friction, water pressure and mobil￾ity, and treatment for bound materials. 
Characterization of material erodibility was attempted by many. PIARC (the World Road 
Association) developed specifcations for characterizing the erosion potential of base and subbase 
material into fve classes (PIARC, 1987). This is presented in Table 15.1. 
Other methods for developing more reliable predictors for erodibility include the rotational 
shear device, which uses water for erosion after applying a critical shear stress (this does not evalu￾ate cohesive materials); the jetting erosion device, which is a modifed rotational shear device that 
can evaluate cohesive soils; the brush test, which assesses the erosion due to a standard brush and 
load of a soil by measuring weight loss; and the South African erosion test, which uses a loaded 
wheel on a submerged confned soil specimen and quantifes erodibility using the Erosion Index (L). 
15.1.4 CHARACTERIZING FREE WATER WITHIN A PAVEMENT STRUCTURE 
The enhanced integrated climatic model (EICM) is a one-dimensional couple heat and fow pro￾gram that is used for analyzing pavement soil systems with climatic conditions. EICM can model 
numerous climate-related parameters such as rainfall, solar radiation, cloud cover, wind speed, and 
air temperature, but the prediction of moisture at the interface between the PCC slab and base is 
essential to modeling pumping and faulting. 
TABLE 15.1 
PIARC Recommendations for Erosion Potential of Base/Subbase Material 
Class Description 
A: extremely erosion Class A materials are extremely resistant to erosion. The typical material of this category is lean 
resistant concrete with at least 7%–8% cement (or 6% with special addition of fnes) or bituminous 
concrete with a bitumen content of at least 6%. 
B: erosion resistant Class B materials are fve times more erodible (on average) than class A materials, but they still offer 
good guarantees of erosion resistance because they are far from the threshold at which erodibility 
increases exponentially. The typical material of this category is a granular material that is cement 
treated in the plant and contains 5% cement. 
C: erosion resistant Class C materials are fve times more erodible (on average) than those in class B, and they are close 
to the threshold under which erodibility increases very rapidly in inverse proportion to the amount 
of binder. The typical material of this category is a granular material that is cement treated in the 
plant and contains 3.5% cement or a bitumen-treated granular material with 3% bitumen. 
D: fairly erodible Class D materials are fve times more erodible (on average) than those of Class C. Their low binder 
content makes their erosion-resistance properties highly dependent on construction conditions and 
the homogeneity of the material. The typical material of this category is a granular material treated 
in place with 2.5% cement. Also falling within this category are fne soils treated in place, such as 
cement treated silt-lime and cement treated sand. By extension, clean, well-graded, good-quality 
granular materials would also fall in this category. 
E: very erodible Class E materials are over fve times more erodible (on average) than those of class D. Class E 
materials are untreated or very poorly treated mixes. The typical material of this category is an 
unprocessed treated material rich in fne elements, and especially untreated silt.

The PRS M-E model estimates JPCP transverse joint faulting in two ways: estimating faulting with￾out considering the amount of consolidation around dowels and estimating faulting while consider￾ing the amount of consolidation around dowels. 
The model is presented as follows: 
FAULT = DAMAGE0.275 × [0.1741 − 0.0009911 × DAYS90 + 0.001082 × PRECIP] 
where 
FAULT is the average transverse joint faulting per joint, in. 
DAMAGE = n/N 
n is the actual number of applied cumulative 18 kip ESALs 
N is the allowable number of applied cumulative 18 kip ESALs 
DAYS90 is the number of days per year with the maximum temperature greater than 32°C (90°F)

DE is the differential energy density at a corner 
DE at a corner is defned as the energy difference in the elastic base/subgrade deformation under 
the loaded leave slab and the unloaded approach slab. Another parameter used in the calculation of 
DE is that for the nondimensional aggregate interlock stiffness (AGG*) factor. When the percentage 
of consolidation around dowels is not considered, AGG* is computed using the following equation:

The computation of DE involves completing a multistep process in which maximum corner defec￾tions are computed for loaded and unloaded conditions. 
15.1.6 PUNCHOUTS IN CONTINUOUSLY REINFORCED CONCRETE PAVEMENTS 
Punchouts are the main structural distress of continuously reinforced concrete pavements 
(CRCP). Punchouts initiate as transverse cracks. Continued traffc loading on the pavement 
edge, coupled with loss of support for the slab, will eventually lead to a loss of load transfer at 
the transverse cracks. This scenario results in a section of the PCC slab between the transverse 
cracks to behave like a cantilever beam when subjected to wheel loads at the slab edge. When 
excessive stresses build up, micro-cracking develops and eventually top-down cracking leads to 
punchouts (Figure 15.4). 
Load transfer effciency (LTE) at the transverse crack is critical to potential tensile stresses that 
develop at the cantilever joint due to wheel edge loading. If adequate aggregate interlock exists at 
the transverse crack, the progression of punchouts could be retarded. Adequate load transfer is pro￾vided by aggregate at the crack interface, suffcient steel reinforcement in the CRCP, and PCC slab 
thickness that may increase the surface area of aggregate interlock faces. 
Loss of foundation support will increase the shear at the crack faces, reduce aggregate interlock, 
and increase the tensile stresses at the cantilever section, resulting in increased potential for pun￾chouts. Therefore, it is critical to maintain a non-erodible base. This can be accomplished by using 
cement or asphalt-treated bases.

15.1.6.1 Development of CRCP Punchout Models 
Punchouts are commonly formed between transverse cracks spaced less than 2ft apart. This, cou￾pled with tensile stress development, LTE, and edge loading, could be used as a framework for 
developing CRCP punchout models. The following process is recommended: 
Assemble relevant pavement properties 
Determine transverse crack spacing 
Estimate number of crack spacing less than 2 ft 
Estimate transverse crack width and mean LTE over time 
Compute tensile stress at top of slab 
Compute tensile stress-to-strength ratio and allowable number of load repetitions 
Use Miner’s damage model to compute fatigue damage for 2ft crack spacing 
Calibrate cumulative fatigue damage with feld punchout distress data to predict punchouts. 
Procedure for determining transverse crack development (after Abou-Ayyash, 1974): 
Determine tensile strength of CRCP slab at time tn 
Compute drying shrinkage Zn, change in temperature ΔT1 at time t1 
Calculate maximum tensile stress generated in CRCP 
Compare computed CRCP stress to concrete tensile strength; cracking will occur if actual 
concrete slab stress exceeds concrete tensile strength 
Increase time to t2 and repeat the process. If failure occurs between time n and (n+ 1), then use 
iterative tools to determine the exact time of cracking between intervals 
Repeat the process at a later time and search for additional cracks, modifying the slab con￾fguration to account for initial cracks. 
Crack spacing in CRCP is affected by numerous factors such as concrete properties, age, envi￾ronmental conditions, reinforcement content, placement and steel properties, slab geometry and 
boundary conditions, and construction factors, among others. 
The bending tensile stress at the cantilever joint in the transverse direction is used to compute the 
critical pavement response parameter stress ratio (SR), and is calculated as follows: 
° SR ˜ MR
where 
σ is the top tensile stress in the transverse direction along the longitudinal crack for CRCP 
MR is the PCC fexural strength 
The number of allowable load repetitions is computed using the stress ratio by the following: 
logNij = ∀(SR)Ω 
where 
SR is the stress ratio 
Ω∀ are the regression constants 
Fatigue damage is then determined using Miner’s damage accumulation equation and can account 
for incremental damage due to traffc, concrete properties, age, foundation, and seasonal and climate

458 Pavement Engineering 
variables. The cumulative fatigue damage due to all transverse crack spacings can be accumulated 
over the entire crack spacing distribution using Miner’s approach: 
i FD ˜ °n n
i˜1 Ni
where 
FD is the accumulated fatigue damage for ith crack spacing 
ni is the number of applied ESALs 
Ni is the number of allowable ESALs 
i is the counter for crack spacing 
15.1.6.2 Punchout Distress Model 
An example of an M-E based distress model that predicts punchouts as a function of accumulated 
fatigue damage due to bending in the transverse direction is given by the following: 
PO = 100e−(FD/α)β
where 
PO is the total predicted number of punchouts per mile 
FD is the accumulated fatigue damage (due to slab bending in the transverse direction) assuming 
ith crack spacing 
α, β are the calibration constants for punchout prediction 
It can be seen that punchouts occur due to the deterioration of transverse cracks that develop in CRCP 
slabs. The transverse cracks are induced by climate-related tensile stresses and built-in curling and warping 
stresses, and they deteriorate due to traffc loading, loss of base support, and loss of load transfer through 
the transverse crack. Fatigue cantilever stresses due to repeated wheel edge loads will eventually fracture 
the slab and cause it to settle into a moderate to severe punchout. Punchouts are infuenced to a certain 
degree by the following parameters: PCC slab thickness, PCC stiffness or elastic modulus, base/subbase 
support, amount and depth of reinforcing steel, coeffcient of thermal expansion for steel, shrinkage of 
PCC, PCC creep characteristics, slab-base friction, age, temperature, and humidity during construction. 
15.1.7 SMOOTHNESS CONSIDERATIONS 
Smoothness or roughness is a rider-perceived judgment of pavement ride quality. A pavement’s 
functionality is based more on ride quality and user comfort than on structural performance. Road 
roughness does not have one standard defnition. Road roughness can be described as the lack of 
smoothness. The American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) defnes roughness as follows: 
“The deviations of a pavement surface from a true planar surface with characteristic dimensions 
that affect vehicle dynamics, ride quality, dynamic loads, and drainage, for example, longitudinal 
profle, transverse profle, and cross slope.” Or it has been described as the “irregularities in the 
pavement surface that affect the smoothness of the ride or induce vibration in traveling vehicles.” 
Road roughness is caused by either longitudinal or transverse distortions in the roadway, where 
longitudinal is in the direction of travel and transverse is perpendicular to the direction of travel. 
Longitudinal distortions can occur in either long wavelengths or short wavelengths. Long wave￾lengths are caused by consolidation of the pavement’s foundation material and usually occur with 
high amplitudes but low frequency. Transverse distortions are usually the result of rutting or settle￾ment within the road. Roadways with various frequencies and amplitudes of distortions cause oscil￾lations in vehicles traveling over the pavement, and these oscillations are referred to as roughness. 
ISTUDYDistress Models and Material Characterization for Concrete 459 
To determine roughness or smoothness, a pavement profle must be obtained. A profle can be 
defned as the elevation profle representation of a two-dimensional slice of pavement surface. To 
obtain a profle, one can use a rod and level, a Dipstick™ (walking elevation measuring device), or 
an inertial profler. 
An inertial proflometer is a vehicle that is equipped with an accelerometer mounted to an axle 
and provides inertial reference by measuring the vertical acceleration of the vehicle. A sensor 
mounted to the vehicle’s body measures the distance from a set point on the vehicle to the pavement. 
This is the vehicle’s relative elevation displacement. Different types of distance measuring sensors 
are commonly used such as laser, optical, and ultrasound. Since the sensors are digital instruments, 
they only measure on a set interval. This interval, expressed in terms of the longitudinal vehicle 
motion between readings, is known as sample spacing. 
To determine the profle, the accelerations are frst integrated twice to determine the vertical 
displacement of the axle. The change between the height and relative displacement is the pavement 
profle. The longitudinal distance is measured using a distance measuring device (DMI). 
There are two different types of inertial proflers—high speed and lightweight. High-speed 
devices are those which are usually van mounted and operate at highway speeds. Lightweight iner￾tial proflers are mounted on a smaller vehicle, similar to a golf cart. The high-speed proflers are 
typically used for network condition assessment, while the lightweights are used for pavement con￾struction quality acceptance. 
The International Roughness Index (IRI) is an index computed from the cumulative elevation 
changes over a distance, as determined from a longitudinal road. This is correlated to a standard 
quarter-car (one wheel’s suspension) model and measures the cumulative output of the suspension 
travel. It was developed for the World Bank in 1982 to establish a relevant, transportable, and time￾stable measure of road roughness. 
The IRI is an important ride quality statistic used for M-E smoothness modeling. The M-E 
design procedures include performance prediction models to predict the progression of certain key 
pavement distresses over the design life of a pavement. 
Pavement smoothness or ride quality has been used since the AASHO Road Test. The present 
serviceability rating (PSR) concept was a subjective assessment of ride quality, while the PSI was 
developed as an objective quantitative assessment. The longitudinal portion of the PSI contributed 
greatly to the PSI value. And, therefore, smoothness has become used as the parameter that most 
closely relates to serviceability. 
The frst model to relate serviceability and distress was developed for the AASHO Road Test (as 
developed by Carey and Irick, 1960). The PSR was defned as follows: 
PSR = C + A1R1 + B1D1 + B2D2 
where 
C, A1, B1, B2 are the regression coeffcients 
R1 is the function of longitudinal profle 
D1 is the function of transverse profle 
D2 is the function of surface distress 
The rigid pavement model used for the AASHO Road Test was given as follows: 
PSR = 5.41 − 1.78log(1 + SV)−0.09(C + P)0.5 
where 
PSR is the present serviceability rating or panel mean rating 
SV is the slope variance 
is the major cracking in ft per 1000 ft2 area 
P is the bituminous patching in ft2 per 1000 ft2 area 
C 
ISTUDY 
460 Pavement Engineering 
Slope variance is defned as follows: 
2
˙ Y ° 1
˛˙ Y˝
2
SV ˜ n
n °1
where 
Y is the difference between two elevations 9 in. apart 
n is the number of elevation readings 
Correlation statistics show that PSR is highly correlated with smoothness and distress for rigid 
pavements. It was also observed that distress greatly affects smoothness or profle measurements. 
Other researchers have studied and developed various models to correlate smoothness to pavement 
distress features. Unfortunately, the models vary widely based on the type and extent of distress. 
Increasing quantities and severities of distresses such as cracking, faulting, joint spalling, crack 
and joint deterioration, and punchouts will greatly infuence smoothness degradation in pavements. 
Hence, the development of M-E pavement distress models will be an initial step to the development 
of smoothness models. Therefore, input parameters for distress models, such as traffc, construction, 
and environment over time, will also be applicable for smoothness predictor models. 
Initial smoothness was found to be highly correlated to future smoothness and degradation of 
smoothness. Pavements that are built with a smoother profle tend to last longer and will remain 
smoother longer. This probably relates to the quality of the construction, where smoother pave￾ments are a result of good construction practices. In addition, smoother pavements will be subject 
to less truck-dynamic loads than a rougher pavement surface (NCHRP 1–31). This can be seen in 
the incorporation of smoothness specifcations that are part of many state highway agencies’ new 
pavement construction projects. Smoothness of new pavements has become so important to the 
owners and riding public that many new construction specifcations have included a bonus/penalty 
clause. If the contractor exceeds expectations, he or she is paid a bonus. If the contractor has not met 
smoothness specifcations, he or she must pay a penalty or reconstruct the pavement if it is below a 
certain threshold. 
Any factors that will contribute to changing the pavement profle will contribute to smoothness 
loss. This includes foundation movement (consolidation and swelling of soils, and frost-susceptible 
soils), maintenance activities (such as patching and crack flling), and initial smoothness. Therefore, 
these conditions must be addressed when developing predictor models for pavement smoothness. 
A model to predict smoothness could be structured as follows: 
S(t) = S0 + ai
D(t)i
 + bi
Mj
 + ci
SF 
where 
S(t) is the pavement smoothness over time (IRI, m/km) 
S0 is the initial smoothness over time (IRI, m/km) 
ai
 bi
 ci are the regression constants 
D(t)i is the ith distress at a given time 
Mj are the maintenance activities that signifcantly infuence smoothness (e.g., patching and 
crack flling) 
SF are the site factors, which are defned as follows: 
SF = AGE(SC1 × SC2 × SC3) 
ISTUDYDistress Models and Material Characterization for Concrete 461 
 
 
 
 
A model example using the proposed structure described earlier was developed under a FHWA 
study (Hoerner et al., 2000). Input parameters include initial IRI, cracking, spalling, and faulting. 
A site factor (SITE) was added to account for the effects of age, Freezing Index, and percentage of 
subgrade passing the 0.075mm (No. 200) sieve. The model that predicts smoothness in IRI is given 
as follows: 
IRI = IRI0 + 0.013 × %CRACKED + 0.007 × %SPALL + 0.001 × TFAULT + 0.03 × SITE 
where 
IRIi is the initial smoothness measured in m/km 
%CRACKED is the percentage of slabs with transverse cracking and corner cracks (all severities), 
expressed as a number between 0 and 100 
%SPALL is the percentage of joints with spalling (medium and high severities), expressed as a 
number between 0 and 100 
TFAULT is the total joint faulting cumulated per km, mm 
SITE is the site factor = AGE (1 + FI)1.5 (1 + P0.075) × 10−6 
AGE is the pavement age since construction 
FI is the Freezing Index, °C days 
P0.075 is the percentage of subgrade material passing the 0.075 (No. 200) sieve, expressed 
as a number between 0 and 100 
This model can predict future smoothness in IRI as a function of initial IRI, transverse slab crack￾ing, transverse joint spalling, transverse joint faulting, and pavement site condition. 
15.2 TESTS FOR CONCRETE 
15.2.1 FLEXURAL STRENGTH TESTS 
The fexural strength (also called the modulus of rupture, or MOR) is a specifed design parameter 
for rigid pavements. This is due to the fact that pavements are stressed in bending during traffc 
loading and under curling stresses. The fexural strength can be determined using two different 
tests: a center-point load (Figure 15.5) and a third-point load. The beam size is typically 6 × 6 × 20 in. 
for an aggregate maximum size less than 2 in. 
The difference between the two test methods is that the third-point method provides pure 
moment in the middle third of the span with no shear. In the center-point load, the point of frac￾ture is unknown, and there is both moment and shear contributing to the failure. The standard 
fexural strength test is given by AASHTO T 97 and ASTM C 78, (Flexural Strength of Concrete 
[Using Simple Beam with Third-Point Loading]), and AASHTO T 177 and ASTM C 293, (Flexural 
Strength of Concrete [Using Simple Beam with Center-Point Loading]). 
The MOR of rupture is calculated using the following equation: 
Mc MOR = I
where 
M is the moment 
c is the distance from neutral axis to the extreme fber 
I is the moment of inertia 
ISTUDY 
 
462 Pavement Engineering 
FIGURE 15.5 Center-point fexural strength test. 
Usually, mix designs are typically tested for both fexural and compressive strength; they must meet 
a minimum fexural strength, which is then correlated to measured compressive strengths so that 
compressive strength (an easier test) can be used in feld acceptance tests. 
15.2.2 COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH 
The compressive strength test is performed using a 6×12in. cylinder after 28days of curing. The test is 
shown in Figure 15.6 and is conducted in accordance with AASHTO T 22 and ASTM C 39 (Compressive 
Strength of Cylindrical Concrete Specimens). Although the MOR is the specifed strength for structural 
design in rigid pavements, the compressive strength is a much easier test to conduct and can be correlated 
reliably to the MOR. Hence, compressive strength is used by certain agencies for acceptance criteria. The 
compressive strength test is also less prone to testing variation than the fexural strength tests. 
15.2.3 TENSILE STRENGTH 
PCC tensile strength is important in pavement applications. Tensile strength may be used as a PCC 
performance measure for pavements because it best simulates tensile stresses at the bottom of the 
PCC surface course during traffc loading. Because of secondary stresses generated during grip￾ping and pulling of a sample, a true direct tensile strength is diffcult to conduct. Therefore, tensile 
stresses are typically measured indirectly using a splitting tension test. 
A splitting tension test (AASHTO T 198 and ASTM C 496, Splitting Tensile Strength of 
Cylindrical Concrete Specimens) uses a standard 6 × 12 in. cylinder laid on its side. A diametral 
compressive load is then applied along the length of the cylinder until it fails (see Figure 15.7). 
ISTUDYDistress Models and Material Characterization for Concrete 463 
 
FIGURE 15.6 Compressive strength test. 
FIGURE 15.7 Tensile strength test. 
Because PCC is much weaker in tension than compression, the cylinder will typically fail due to 
horizontal tension and not due to a vertical compression. 
The modulus of elasticity for normal weight concrete (Ec) ranges between 2,000,000 and 
6,000,000 psi. It can be determined by calculating the stress-to-strain ratio in the elastic range in 
accordance with ASTM C 469. Alternatively, it can be approximated using the ACI empirical equa￾tions by Ec = 57,000√f′c (f′c in psi) or Ec = 5, 000√f′c (f′c in SI units). 
The value of Poisson’s ratio for concrete will range between 0.15 and 0.25 but is commonly 
selected as 0.20–0.21. 
15.2.4 COEFFICIENT OF THERMAL EXPANSION TEST 
In this test (AASHTO TP 60), a concrete sample is placed in a temperature-controlled chamber, 
and its expansion is monitored at different temperatures. The values range from 6 to 13 × 10−6/°C. 
ISTUDY 
 
464 Pavement Engineering 
15.2.5 FATIGUE TESTING FOR PCC 
In a fatigue test for PCC, a repeated fexural loading is applied on a prismatic beam specimen mea￾suring 3 × 3 × 15 in. Loading is usually applied at the third points with a rate of 1–2 repetitions per 
second (2 Hz) for a duration of 0.1 s. 
The stress (σ) in the extreme fber of the beam is calculated using the following equation: 
3aP
˜ ° bh2
where 
a is the distance from the edge support to the inner support 
P is the total applied load 
b is base of the beam 
h is height of the beam 
Note: when the third points are equidistant and a = L/3, then the stress equation reduces to PL/bh2. 
The results are plotted on a semilog plot where the number of cycles to failure are plotted on the 
log scale—(log Nf) is plotted versus the fexural stress ratio (the quotient of the applied cyclic stress, 
σ, and the modulus of rupture, Sc, as determined by ASTM C 78-84). 
Based on numerous published data, it has been observed that the concrete will not reach failure 
by fatigue if the stress ratio is less than 50% after approximately 20 million cycles or repetitions 
(Mindess and Young, 1981; Neville, 1981). Based on data published by others, Huang (1993) found 
that the relationship representing a 50% probability of failure is expressed as follows: 
˛  ˆ logNf ˜ 17 61. °17.61˙ ˘ ˝ Sc ˇ
Similarly, the Portland Cement Association recommends the use of the following fatigue equations:

15.3 COMPOSITE PAVEMENTS 
The main problem in composite pavements that has been identifed is the wide transverse refec￾tive cracks; the best method that has been identifed to prevent this is the use of crack inducers or 
“joints” at an interval of 15 ft or less. Both dry sawed and wet formed joints have been used, and 
some experience showing the utility of joints every 8–13 ft in reducing defection and improving 
load transfer, in addition to reducing refective cracking, is available. 
One reason for using composite pavements in urban areas (example, New York city) is the good 
load carrying capacity of PCC, and the ability to avoid rehabilitation work (and the associated 
lane closures, delays, and problems) for longer periods of time, as well as for providing a low noise 
ISTUDYDistress Models and Material Characterization for Concrete 465 
 
surface (providing Asphalt Rubber Friction Course, ARFC over PCC in Arizona and porous HMA 
over PCC in the Netherlands). Another reason to use composite pavement is that it offers a way 
to optimize the structure and utilize materials by using superior quality material near the top and 
relatively lower quality materials in the bottom layers without sacrifcing the quality of the pave￾ment and have good friction and longer life of the pavement. Because of the covering of HMA, 
and reduction in the moisture and temperature gradient in the underlying PCC slab, there is the 
potential of reduction of thickness (compared to bare PCC slab) and, hence, a reduction in cost. 
This structure also allows the use of polish susceptible aggregates in the PCC and offers the ability 
to recycle old existing concrete pavements. 
15.4 DISTRESS MECHANISM FOR DESIGN OF COMPOSITE PAVEMENTS 
In composite pavements, specifcally in jointed PCC pavements, the most prevalent type of dis￾tress is refective cracking, which happens due to horizontal and/or differential vertical movements 
between different layers at a discontinuity in the underlying PCC layer. The problem may not be 
present in properly designed CRC pavement with adequate thickness and reinforcement. 
The different techniques that are available for avoiding or limiting refective cracking include the 
use of bond breakers such as stone layer between HMA and PCC, stress-absorbing membrane inter￾layer or strain-relieving interlayer and cushion courses, geotextiles, geogrids, refection crack relief 
interlayer (RCRI; layer of open graded HMA with 25%–35% voids), thicker HMA layer, dowel bars 
at the JPC joints for adequate load transfer, polymers in HMA, and saw and sealing of the HMA 
layer above the joints using CRC. The last two approaches have been found to be the most effective 
in controlling refective cracking in HMA/PCC composite pavements. 
An inadequate bond between the HMA and the PCC can lead to debonding, loss of interlayer 
friction, and resultant fatigue cracking, slippage cracks, and potholes. Application of tack coat, 
therefore, is critical, as well as texturing the PCC layer. If recycled concrete aggregates are used, 
then freeze-thaw durability could be an issue.

Mix Design and 16 Structural Design for 
Concrete Pavements 
16.1 MIX DESIGN 
The absolute volume method detailed in ACI 211 is commonly used to proportion the local concrete 
materials to achieve the desired fresh and ultimate hardened concrete properties. This includes 
selecting the water-cement ratio, coarse and fne aggregate, cement and supplementary cementitious 
materials, water, and admixture requirements. The effects of all of these volumetric properties are 
interrelated. Their selection depends on many factors, including the compressive strength, which is 
the simplest and easiest to measure. 
16.1.1 CONCRETE STRENGTH 
According to ACI 318 (American Concrete Institute, ACI Committee 318, 2002), a concrete 
strength test is defned by the average compressive strength of two concrete cylinders. The run￾ning average of three consecutive tests must be equal to or greater than the specifed compressive 
strength (f′c) at 28 days. ACI 318 also requires the (f′c) to be at least 2500 psi (17.5 MPa), and no 
individual test (average of two cylinders) can be more than 500 psi (3.5 MPa) below the specifed 
strength (ACI 318). To allow for variability in materials, batching, mixing, placing, fnishing, 
curing, and testing the concrete, the ACI recommends a higher target strength that would assure 
the designer to achieve the minimum specifed strength, which is called (f′cr) (see Table 16.1, 
Table 16.2, and Table 16.3).

16.1.2 WATER-TO-CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS RATIO 
The water-to-cementitious materials ratio (or water-cementitious ratio; W/CM), is the mass of water divided 
by the mass of all cements, blended cements, and pozzolanic materials such as fy ash, slag, silica fume, and 
natural pozzolans. In most literature, water-cement ratio (W/C) is used synonymously with W/CM. 
Assuming that a concrete is made with clean sound aggregates and that the cement hydration 
has progressed normally, the strength gain is inversely proportional to the water-cementitious ratio 
by mass. The paste strength is proportional to the solids volume or the cement density per unit 
volume Abrams, D.A. (1919) Design of concrete Mixture, Vol 1, Structural Materials Research 
Laboratory, Lewis (Abrams, 1919) and is shown schematically in Figure 16.1. It should be men￾tioned, however, that the cement hydration process is more complex in its microstructural develop￾ment of calcium silicate hydrates and pore structure. But even at a given water-cementitious ratio, 
differences in strength may result based on the infuence of aggregate gradation, shape, particle 
size, surface texture, strength, and stiffness, or factors associated with cement materials (e.g., dif￾ferent sources, chemical composition, and physical attributes), the amount of entrained air, and the 
effects of admixtures and curing. A typical relationship between W/C, compressive strength, and 
air entrainment is shown in Figure 16.2.

16.1.3 SELECTION OF THE WATER-TO-CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS RATIO 
The selection of the W/CM is infuenced by strength requirements and exposure conditions. The 
W/CM will govern the permeability or watertightness that is necessary for preventing aggres￾sive salts and chemicals from entering the paste pore system and causing deleterious effects 
in the concrete or reinforcing steel. For different exposure conditions, ACI recommendations 
ISTUDY 
 
 
 
470 Pavement Engineering 
for a maximum W/CM and minimum design compressive strengths are provided in Table 16.4 
and Table 16.5. For pavement design, fexural strength is recognized as the more appropriate 
strength characteristic and is specifed for pavement design. However, the ACI uses only com￾pressive strength in its specifcations because of the lower variability associated with compres￾sive strength testing.

When durability does not govern, the W/CM should be selected based on compressive strength. 
In this case, adequate knowledge about strength and mix proportions should be obtained through 
trial mixes or feld data. For example, Figure 16.2 and Table 16.6 and Table 16.7 show the relation￾ship between the W/CM and compressive strength for a given concrete mix and curing conditions. 
It should be noted that the ACI-recommended values given in subsequent tables and fgures should 
be a starting point from which to initiate the mix design process. Variations in mix ingredients may 
require a few iterations to optimize the desired properties.

16.1.4 AGGREGATES 
Aggregates have an important role in proportioning concrete. Aggregates have a great effect on the 
workability of fresh concrete. The aggregate particle size and gradation, shape, and surface texture 
will infuence the amount of concrete that is produced with a given amount of paste (cement plus 
water). The selection of the maximum size aggregate is governed by the thickness of the slab and by 
the closeness of the reinforcing steel. The maximum size aggregates should not be obstructed and 
should fow easily during placement and consolidation. 
Guidelines provided by ACI state that the maximum size coarse aggregate should not exceed 
one-ffth of the narrowest dimension between the sides of forms, or three-fourths of the clear 
space between individual reinforcing bars or the clear spacing between reinforcing bars and 
form walls. For unreinforced slabs on grade, the maximum aggregate size should not exceed 
one-third of the slab thickness. For pavements, typically 1–1.5 in. maximum size aggregate is 
used. 
The most desirable gradation for fne aggregate will depend on the properties of the con￾crete the designer is trying to seek and will depend on coarse aggregate volume and maximum 
size, and amount of paste. Figure 16.3 and Table 16.8 provide the recommended bulk volume 
fraction of coarse aggregate per unit volume of concrete based on the maximum nominal size 
of the coarse aggregate and the fneness modulus of the sand or fne aggregate. PCC for pave￾ments may have a stiffer consistency and therefore coarse aggregate volumes may be increased 
by 10%.

16.1.5 AIR CONTENT IN CONCRETE 
The purposeful entrainment of air in concrete provides tremendous protection against freezing and 
thawing action and against deicing salts. Hydraulic pressure is generated when water in the paste 
pore structure freezes and pushes against the unfrozen water. The tiny, entrained air bubbles act as 
relief valves for this developed hydraulic pressure. Figure 16.4 shows the recommended relationship 
between the target percentage air content, the maximum nominal aggregate size, and the severity 
of exposure. 
16.1.6 SLUMP 
Fresh concrete must have the appropriate workability, consistency, and plasticity suitable for con￾struction conditions. Workability is a measure of the ease of placement, consolidation, and fnish￾ing of the concrete. Consistency is the ability of freshly mixed concrete to fow, and plasticity 
assesses the concrete’s ease of molding. If the concrete is too dry and crumbly, or too wet and 
soupy, then it lacks plasticity. The slump test is a measure of consistency and indicates when the 
characteristics of the fresh mix have been changed or altered. However, the slump is indicative of 
workability when assessing similar mixtures. Different slumps are needed for different construc￾tion projects. Table 16.9 provides recommendations for slump for different types of construction. 
For pavements, state DOTs may use different slump specifcations for fxed form and slipform 
construction. 
16.1.7 WATER CONTENT 
The water demands for a concrete mix depend on many variables, including mix proportions, air 
content, aggregate gradation, angularity and texture, and climate conditions. Table 16.10 and Table 
16.11 and Figure 16.5 present the relationship between mix water, different slumps, and nominal 
maximum size aggregates (NMSAs). The recommendations given in Table 16.10 and Table 16.11 
and Figure 16.5 are for angular aggregates, and the water estimates may be reduced by 20–45 lb for 
subangular to rounded aggregates, respectively.

16.1.8 CEMENTING MATERIALS CONTENT AND TYPE 
The cementing materials content is usually determined based on the specifed water-to-cementitious 
materials ratio. However, usually a minimum amount of cement is also specifed to ensure satisfactory 
durability, fnishability, and wear resistance of slabs even though strength needs may be satisfed at 
lower cement contents, as shown in Table 16.12. However, economic mixes are obtained with the least 
amount of cement. To accomplish this, the concrete should be as stiff as possible, should use the larg￾est practical maximum coarse aggregate, and should use the optimum ratio of coarse to fne aggregate. 
For durability, the type of cement used is also important. When the concrete will be exposed to 
signifcant amounts of sulfates, cements with low C3A contents should be used, as presented in Table 
16.5. When the potential for corrosion of reinforcing bars exists due to a favorable chloride condi￾tion, then blended cements and a low W/CM should be considered. ACI 357R should be consulted 
for designing for corrosion protection. Table 16.13 shows limits on the amounts of pozzolans and

mineral admixtures to be used when designing concrete exposed to deicing chemicals. It should be 
noted that these ACI recommendations should be used as a starting point for trial mixes. However, 
local experience should be consulted whenever it exists. 
16.1.9 ADMIXTURES 
Admixtures are used in concrete to enhance the desirable characteristics in the fresh and hardened 
concrete. This includes reducing the W/CM, entraining air, retarding or accelerating the set time, 
increasing the slump without increasing the W/CM, inhibiting corrosion, and self-leveling. Some 
admixtures are calcium chloride based and may affect steel corrosion. ACI 318 places limits on the 
maximum chloride ion content for corrosion protection, as presented in Table 16.14.

The design of a concrete mix using the ACI method is explained with the following example. 
16.1.10 EXAMPLE OF MIX DESIGN 
Concrete is specifed for a 10-in. pavement slab that will be exposed to severe freeze-thaw condi￾tions and a moist environment. The required 28 day compressive strength is 3500 psi. 
Cement: Type II, Sp. Gr. 3.15. 
Coarse aggregate: well-graded gravel containing some crushed particles. The maximum 
nominal size is 3/4in., with a specifc gravity of 2.65 and an oven dry-rodded unit weight 
of 100 pcf; the moisture content for the trial batch is 3%; and the absorption is 0.7%. 
Fine aggregate: a natural sand with a specifc gravity of 2.60; moisture content for the trial 
batch is 1.2%; the absorption is 2.8%; and the fneness modulus is 2.50. 
The required W/CM is determined by strength (or structural design) and durability requirements. 
Our strength requires a 3500 psi concrete. Since no statistical data exist, Table 16.3 is used to estab￾lish a target strength, f′cr = f′c + 1200 psi. Our new target compressive strength is (3500 + 1200 = 
4700 psi). For an environment with moist freezing and thawing, the maximum W/CM is 0.45 (Table 
16.4). From Figure 16.2, the recommended W/CM = 0.42 for a compressive strength of 4700 psi. 
Or it could be interpolated from Table 16.7. Table 16.4 suggests a W/CM of 0.45 to protect against 
moisture and freeze-thaw conditions. However, since the lower W/CM governs, the W/CM = 0.42 
is based on strength. 
Select slump when it is not specifed according to the desired application from Table 16.9. For 
a pavement slab, choose a slump of 3 in. Note that you can add 1 in. to the maximum values when 
placing by hand or rodding. For slip forming construction, the slump could be as low as zero. 
Specifed maximum coarse aggregate size: 3/4 in. This could be dictated by availability and the 
ACI, which states that the maximum coarse aggregate size should be less than one-third of the slab 
thickness or not more than three-fourths of the distance between reinforcements, and not more than 
one-ffth of form dimensions. 
The water content requirement depends upon the coarse aggregate maximum size, particle shape 
and grading of aggregates, and amount of air entrainment. From Table 16.11 for a 3-in. slump, a 
3/4-in. maximum coarse aggregate, and an air-entrained concrete, we need 305 lb of water per yd3. 
Since our aggregate is a gravel with some crushed particles, the water content may be reduced by 
35 lb. Therefore, (305 − 35 = 270).

Air content: for a severe freeze-thaw exposure, Table 16.11 recommends a target air content of 
6%. Since it is diffcult to achieve a target value for air, a range of +2% and −1% is acceptable, hence 
a range of 5%–8%. Use 7% air. 
Cement content: calculate based on the maximum W/CM.

Coarse aggregate content: estimate the quantity of 3/4-in. maximum size coarse aggregate with a 
sand fneness modulus of 2.5. 
From Table 16.8 and Figure 16.3, an amount of 0.65 yd3 may be used. Since our coarse aggregate 
weighs 100 pcf, the required dry weight per yd3 is as follows: 
100 pcf*27 ft3/yd3*0.65 = 1755 lb (dry) 
Admixture content: for a 7% air content, the air-entraining admixture manufacturer recommends a 
dosage of 0.9 f oz per 100 lb of cement.

So far, the mixture proportions are as follows in Table 16.15 (per 1 yd3
): 
Moisture corrections: since the mix water is based on oven-dried aggregate, the batch weights 
must be corrected for absorbed and free moisture in aggregates. For the aggregates with the indi￾cated moisture content (MC), the wet batch weights are as follows: 
Coarse aggregate (MC = 3%):1755*1.03 = 1808 lb/yd3 
Fine aggregate (MC = 1.2%)1119*1.012 = 1132 lb/yd3 
Note: absorbed water should be excluded from mix water, and surface moisture should be included 
in mix water. 
Coarse aggregate absorption = 0.7% 
Fine aggregate absorption = 2.8% 
Coarse aggregate contribution = 3% − 0.7% = +2.3 moisture (subtract from mix water) 
Fine aggregate contribution = 1.2%−2.8% = −1.6% moisture (add to mix water) 
Corrected mix water: 
270 − 1755*(0.023) + 1119*(0.016) = 247 lb/yd3 
The revised batch weights for 1 yd3 are as follows in Table 16.16: 
Trial batch: at this point, trial batches are used to check if the target parameters such as slump, 
air, and workability are met. In addition, concrete cylinders for strength testing at 28days are made

at this point. For a laboratory batch, mixing a smaller volume is adequate. For this example, a 2 ft3 
or 2/27 yd3 batch will be made (Table 16.17). 
Air-entraining admixture: 5.8 * (2/27) = 0.43 f oz 
(Note: usually admixtures are batched in milliliters). Therefore, 5.8 * 29.573 mL/oz = 171.52 mL* 
(2/27) = 12.71 mL. 
After mixing the trial batch, the measured slump was 4 in., the air content was 8%, and the fresh 
concrete density was 140.3 pcf. During mixing, not all of the mix water was used. The net water 
used was 18.30 − 0.5 = 17.8 lb. Therefore, the updated batch weights are as follows in Table 16.18: 
The yield for the trial batch is as follows: 
283.21 = 2 18 ft0
3 . 140.3
The mixing water content is determined from the added water plus the free water on the aggregates, 
and is determined as follows in Table 16.19: 
(The negative sign indicates that the fne aggregate is drier than the absorption moisture content, 
and therefore additional water should be added to the mix to compensate for it.)

Batch adjustments: the measured slump of the trial mix was 4 in. This is higher than the target 
slump of 3 in. and is unacceptable. The measured air content was also too high (more than target of 
7%± 0.5%), and the yield was higher, too. Therefore, we shall adjust the yield, air entrainment, and 
water content to obtain a 3in. slump. 
When adjusting the mix design from the trial batch to the mix proportions for the large batch, 
use the following rule of thumb: increase the water by 5 lb for each 1% air reduction to maintain 
a similar slump and reduce the water by 10 lb for each reduction in slump by 1 in. Therefore, the 
adjusted mix water for the reduced slump and air is as follows: 
(5*1) − (10*1) + 247 = 242 lb/yd3 
Now that the water is reduced, the cement content should decrease for a constant W/CM: 
242 Cement = = 576 lb
0.42
Since the workability is adequate, the coarse aggregate content will not be readjusted. The new 
adjusted batch weights are as follows in Table 16.20:

16.2 STRUCTURAL DESIGN 
16.2.1 AASHTO METHOD (AASHTO, 1993) 
The rigid pavement design guide was developed similarly to the fexible pavement design guide 
based on the AASHO Road Test’s results and knowledge gained. 
The basic equations developed for rigid pavements are similar to and of the same form as the 
fexible pavements but with different regression equation constants.

Gt is the logarithm of the ratio of the loss in serviceability at time t to the potential loss in service￾ability taken at a point in time where pt= 1.5; pt
 is the serviceability at any time t and therefore 
Gt = log[4.5 − pt
/4.5 − 1.5] 
β is the function of design and load variables that dictates the shape of the ρ versus Wt
 curve 
ρ is the function of design and load variables that relates the expected number of load applications 
to a pt
 of 1.5 and ρ= Wt 
Wt is the axle load application at the end of time t 
L1 is the load on one single axle or a set of tandem axles (in kips); for example 18 for an equivalent 
18 kip single axle load; 32 kip for a 32 kip equivalent tandem axle load 
L2 is the axle code; 1 used for single axle; 2 used for tandem axle, and 3 used for tridem 
In the AASHO Road Test, the initial serviceability for rigid pavements was assigned a value of 4.5. 
This value is slightly higher than for fexible pavements which was taken as 4.2; D is the slab thick￾ness which replaces the term SN for fexible pavements. The equation simplifes greatly when using 
an equivalent 18 kip single axle load with L1= 18; L2= 1.

Wt18 predicts the number of 18 kip single axle load applications to time t. The original equation is 
only applicable to the conditions present at the AASHO Road Test. The conditions at the road test 
included: the concrete modulus of elasticity Ec= 4.2 × 106 psi, the modulus of rupture of concrete 
Sc= 690psi, modulus of subgrade reaction k = 60 pci, the joint load transfer coeffcient J = 3.2, and 
the drainage coeffcient Cd= 1.0. 
Over the years, other modifcations were made to the original equation to take into consideration 
factors such as different subgrades and conditions other than those that existed during the AASHO 
Road Test. In 1972, AASHTO adopted a modifcation developed using the Spangler (1942) equation 
to consider corner loading and to extend the original AASHO Road Test equation to other condi￾tions. Other modifcations include the drainage coeffcient Cd, Z = Ec/k and the reliability term ZRSo, 
replacing the term (4.5− pt
) by ΔPSI.

484 Pavement Engineering 
16.2.2 DESIGN INPUT PARAMETERS 
16.2.2.1 Reliability 
The original AASHO equations were based on the mean values, which means that there is a 50% 
chance that the actual pavement would not reach its design life. This is not an acceptable risk for 
large capacity highways that carry a signifcant traffc volume and are essential to the economy. 
Therefore a higher reliability should be expected. 
The reliability term in the AASHTO equation is the product of the ZRSo. The overall standard 
deviation So should be based on the variability of the local conditions. AASHTO recommends a 
value range for So between 0.3 and 0.4. When variability in traffc is considered, then So= 0.39, oth￾erwise an So= 3.4 is typically used. The recommended level of reliability and the standard normal 
deviate ZR are provided by AASHTO and reproduced in Table 12.2. For interstate highways, the 
reliability R% = (85%–99.9%) corresponding to ZR = (−1.037 to −3.75) (AASHTO, 1993). 
16.2.2.2 Serviceability 
The initial serviceability po is an estimate of the perceived smoothness condition of the pavement by 
the user. For the AASHO Road Test conditions, a value of po=4.5 was established for rigid pavements 
and po=4.2 for fexible pavements. These values may vary based on local conditions and SHA recom￾mendations. The terminal serviceability index pt
 is the lowest acceptable level of perceived ride and 
comfort that a SHA will tolerate before major rehabilitation is performed. Values of pt
 of 2.0, 2.5, or 
3.0 are commonly used based on the highway function. The ΔPSI term is the total loss in serviceability. 
This could be due to traffc or foundation support deterioration based on environmental conditions. 
16.2.2.3 Drainage Coeffcient (Cd) 
The effect of drainage is critically important to the performance of rigid pavements. The quality 
of drainage could affect the severity and extent of pumping distress, bearing capacity loss, frost 
damage, and D-cracking among others. Table 16.22 (reproduced from AASHTO, 1993) shows the 
recommended drainage coeffcients based on the quality of drainage and the percent of time that the 
pavement moisture levels approach saturation. 
16.2.2.4 Load Transfer Coeffcient (J) 
The load transfer coeffcient J accounts for the ability of the rigid pavement joint to distribute the load 
across the joint. The value of J depends on the pavement type (JPCP, JRCP, or CRCP), if transfer 
devices such as dowels are used, and the type of shoulder-tied concrete or asphalt. Table 16.23 provides 
the load transfer coeffcient values with the lowest J value for a CRCP with tied concrete shoulders. In 
general the J value for a given set of conditions will increase with an increase in traffc volume since 
aggregate interlock decreases with load repetitions. As a guide, higher J values should be used with 
lower k-values, high values for CTE, and large temperature variations. The most common value J=3.2 
is for a JPCP or JRCP that is doweled but not tied to a concrete shoulder (AASHTO, 1993).

16.2.2.4.1 Modulus of Subgrade Reaction 
The effective modulus of subgrade reaction k-value is a composite value based on a seasonally 
adjusted annual average k-value that is modifed for subbase type and thickness, loss of support due 
to erosion, and proximity to rigid foundation and bedrock. AASHTO recommends the following 
process for determining the composite k-value. The AASHTO 1993 Guide for determining compos￾ite k-value is shown in the next example. 
16.2.2.4.2 Concrete Flexural Strength (Sc) 
The modulus of rupture (Sc) or fexural strength for concrete is required for pavement design. The 
modulus of rupture is determined by using the third point (ASTM C 78) bend test for a 28day cured 
sample. AASHTO recommends that if a SHA commonly uses the center point bend test for deter￾mining the modulus of rupture, then a correlation between the two methods should be performed. 
16.2.2.4.3 Concrete Modulus of Elasticity (Ec) 
The modulus of elasticity Ec for Portland cement concrete is estimated using the ACI equation: 
Ec ˜ 57 000 f° psi ˜ 4 730 fc , ° c , MPa
The value for Ec does not vary substantially over the range of concrete strengths used for slab con￾struction and does not commonly have a large infuence over pavement thickness design. 
16.2.2.4.4 Traffc, ESALs 
AASHTO provides methods for converting single, tandem, and tridem axle loads to ESALs using 
the axle equivalency factor which is covered in Chapter 5. As presented in Chapter 5, the LEF 
can be approximated by the fourth power rule. Appendix D of the AASHTO Guide for Design 
of Pavement Structures (AASHTO, 1993), provides tables of the axle equivalency factors which 
depend on the type of axle (single, tandem, and tridem), the axle load magnitude, the slab thickness, 
and the terminal serviceability, pt
. Ultimately, the AASHTO equation predicts W18 the number of 
18 kip ESAL that will be carried by a pavement over its design life. 
When the AASHO equations were developed in the 1960s and the use of computers was not yet 
common, nomographs were developed to aid in solving the complex equations. Figure 16.6 shows 
the nomograph for solving the following AASHTO equation:

2. Starting at 74 on the Match Line in Figure 16.6b, a line is drawn through ΔPSI = 1.7 
until it reaches the vertical axis. 
3. Using the reliability axis, start with R = 95% and draw a line through So= 0.29, and 
then draw a line through Wt= 5.1 ∗ 106 until it intersects the horizontal axis. 
4. A horizontal line is drawn from the last step in Step 2. A vertical line is drawn from 
the last step in Step 3. The intersection of these two lines gives D = 9.75 in. (246 mm). 
The nomograph can also be used to determine the amount of traffc that will produce a certain 
degradation in the Present Serviceability Index (PSI). 
The property of the subgrade used for rigid pavement design is the modulus of subgrade 
reaction k instead of the resilient modulus Mr
. Therefore, it is necessary to convert Mr
 to k. 
Values of k are also season dependent and will vary over the course of the year. Therefore, 
the relative damage parameter that includes the effect of seasonal change in k-value needs 
to be evaluated. If the PCC slab is placed directly on the subgrade without the use of a base 
or subbase, AASHTO recommends the use of the following theoretical relationship between 
k-values from a plate load bearing test and the resilient modulus, Mr

If a subbase exists between the slab and the subgrade, the composite modulus of subgrade reac￾tion can be determined from Figure 16.7 (AASHTO, 1993). The composite modulus value is based 
on a subgrade of infnite depth, k∞. The chart was developed using the same method as for a homo￾geneous half-space except that the 30-in. plate is applied on a two-layer system. Hence, the k-values 
obtained from the chart are too large and are not representative of values obtained in the feld. 
EXAMPLE 16.2 
Given a subbase thickness DSB of 6 in. (152 mm), a subbase resilient modulus of ESB of 20,000 
psi (138 psi), and a roadbed soil resilient modulus Mr
 of 7000 psi (48MPa), determine the 
composite modulus of subgrade reaction k∞. 
Solution 
The composite of the subgrade reaction can be determined as follows. 
Using Figure 16.7, draw a vertical line from DSB = 6 in. to the curve of ESB = 20,000 psi. The 
same line is drawn downward until it intersects with Mr= 7000 psi, and then the line is turned 
horizontally until it intersects with the turning line. 
First, draw a horizontal line from the point; next, draw a vertical line from the point on the 
turning line. The intersection of these two lines gives a k∞ of 400 pci.

16.2.3 RIGID FOUNDATION AT SHALLOW DEPTH 
If the rigid foundation lies below the subgrade and the subgrade depth to rigid foundation DSB is 
smaller than 10 ft (3m), then the modulus of subgrade reaction must be modifed using the chart 
in Figure 16.8 (AASHTO, 1993). This chart can be used to modify PCC slabs with or without a 
subbase.

it intersects the curve with a DSG = 5 ft. The line is then drawn horizontally until it reaches a

EXAMPLE 16.4
Given D = 9 in. and k = 540 pci, determine the ur
 using the aforementioned equation and 
Figure 16.9.
Solution
From the equation u = [90.75 − 0.3(540)0.725 r ]3.42 = 60.3, which is similar to the value obtained 
using Figure 16.9.
To account for a potential loss of support by foundation erosion or differential vertical soil 
movement, the effective modulus of subgrade reaction must be reduced by the loss of sub￾grade support (LS) factor as shown in Figure 16.10. Table 16.24 provides recommendations 
for LS values for different types of subbases and subgrades.
Table 16.25 shows an example for determining the effective modulus of a subgrade reac￾tion for a slab thickness of 9 in. The slab is to be placed directly onto the subgrade with the 
monthly resilient moduli shown in Table 16.25. Note that the year is divided into 12 months, 
each with different moduli. The normal summer modulus is 7000 psi, and the maximum of 
modulus of 20,000 psi occurs in the winter months when the subgrade is frozen (December–
February). The k-values are obtained from the equation K = Mr
/19.4.

16.2.4.1 Software Solutions 
The AASHTO design equation may be solved using the nomographs or using a spreadsheet or equa￾tion solver software. Two commercial software packages are also available to design pavements 
using the AASHTO 1993 guide. DarWIN is an AASHTO product that is no longer available through 
AASHTO. The AASHTO bookstore currently sells only the new AASHTOWARE Pavement ME 
software to support the new MEP-Design Guide (MEPDG) (http://bookstore.transportation.org). 
WinPAS is available through ACPA (www.acpa.org/winpas/). Both softwares are versatile and can 
solve for pavement thickness and other unknowns and can conduct a reliability analysis. 
The MEPDG Design Guide and software were adopted as the Interim AASHTO pavement 
design standard in 2007 (Von Quintus and Moulthrop, 2007). 
16.2.4.2 AASHTO 1998 Supplement to Design Guide 
The AASHTO Design Guide was developed over the years after the AASHO Road Test was com￾pleted in 1960 and the Interim Guides published in 1961 and 1962 (HRB Special Report, 1962). 
Various enhanced versions of the AASHTO Design Guide were published in 1972, 1986, and 1993. 
The Design Guidelines for Rigid Pavements were similar from 1986 to 1993. The development of 
the AASHTO equations over the years is provided by Huang (2004). 
The original AASHTO equations were developed to predict the number of axle loads (18 kip EASLs) 
for a given slab thickness and loss in serviceability (ΔPSI). These empirical regression equations were 
valid for the specifc pavement and environmental conditions at the AASHO Road test; namely a con￾crete modulus Ec=4.2×106 psi, a modulus of rupture of the concrete Sc=690 psi, a modulus of subgrade 
reaction k=60 pci, a load transfer coeffcient J=3.2, and a drainage coeffcient Cd=1.0. Extension of the 
AASHTO equation to predict traffc loading for a given serviceability beyond those conditions was in 
many cases not adequate. Over the years, the equation was modifed to take into consideration varia￾tions in strength, drainage and environmental conditions, load transfer, and reliability. 
In 1998, AASHTO published a supplement to the 1993 guide; entitled Part II—Rigid Pavement 
Design and Rigid Pavement Joint Design. These new modifcations were based on the study con￾ducted under NCHRP Project 1-30 that used the data from GPS-3, GPS-4, and GPS-5 (JPCP, JRCP, 
and CRCP) sections in the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) studies for model calibra￾tion. The supplement and design procedure were incorporated in a spreadsheet software funded by 
FHWA, and it is now a user-friendly online software which can be accessed through LTPP Products 
Online (https://infopave.fhwa.dot.gov). 
The Rigid Pavement Design Software features four new or modifed design inputs: subgrade 
support, joint spacing, slab/subbase friction, and temperature differential throughout the slab. In the 
1998 guidelines, the subgrade support is characterized by the effective elastic k-value (or seasonally 
adjusted k-value) of the subgrade, compared to the “composite” k-value of the subgrade/base system 
used in the 1993 guide. 
Figure 16.11 shows a screen shot of the input page. The user inputs concrete properties, base 
properties, reliability and standard deviation, climatic properties, subgrade k-value, design equiva￾lent single-axle loads (ESALs), pavement type, joint spacing, and edge support through the input 
screen. A sensitivity analysis feature can allow the designer to change input conditions based on 
design constraints. 
A design example using the AASHTO 1998 supplement procedure for a pavement in Worcester, 
Massachusetts, having a mean annual temperature of 46.8°F, a precipitation of 47.6 in. per year, 
and an average wind speed 12.4 mph is presented in Figure 16.11, Figure 16.12, Figure 16.13, 
Figure 16.14, and Figure 16.15. 
The thickness design for the JPCP with a 15ft joint spacing, an adjusted seasonal composite k-value 
of 120 pci, a base stiffness of 20,000 psi, a thickness of 6in. and a friction factor of 1.4, with an equiva￾lent traffc loading of 20.3 million ESALs and a 95% reliability is determined to be 11.68in. as shown 
in Figure 16.11. The next step is to determine the dowel diameter that will limit the faulting check to

in./°F), a shrinkage strain of −0.00015 in./in., a freezing index of 500°F degree days, and a drainage 
coeffcient Cd of 1.0. Figure 16.12 shows an example of a pavement with a dowel diameter of 1.25in. 
that fails, and Figure 16.13 shows an example of a pavement with a diameter of 1.75in. that just passes. 
Improving the drainage coeffcient Cd to 1.25, will allow a dowel diameter size of 1.25in. to also pass 
the faulting criteria. Sensitivity analysis may also be performed using the Rigid Pavement Online 
Software. Figure 16.14 and Figure 16.15 show sensitivity analysis plots for effective subgrade support 
using the composite k-value with traffc demands and joint spacing, respectively. 
16.2.4.2.1 PCA (1984) Design Procedure 
The PCA design method for concrete roads and streets evaluates a pavement design with respect 
to two potential failure modes: fatigue and erosion. For fatigue failure, the concrete will fail due to 
cumulative damage when the stress to strength ratio exceeds a threshold. For erosion, the pavement 
fails by pumping and erosion of the foundation and joint faulting. The procedure was developed 
using the results of the fnite element computer program JSLAB (Tayabji and Colley, 1986) to deter￾mine the critical stresses and defections induced in concrete pavements by joint, edge, and corner 
loading. The PCA method considers the degree of load transfer provided by dowels or aggregate 
interlock and the degree of edge support provided by a concrete shoulder. 
The PCA procedure uses the “composite-k” concept in which the design k is a function of the 
subgrade soil k, base thickness, and base type (granular or cement treated), similar to the 1986 and 
1993 AASHTO design procedure. 
Fatigue analysis in the PCA method is based on the edge stress midway between transverse 
joints. The fatigue analysis assumes that approximately 6% of all truck loads will pass suffciently 
close to the slab edge to produce a signifcant tensile stress. However, this critical tensile stress is 
reduced considerably when the main traffc lane and the concrete shoulder are tied. Stresses due to 
warping and curling are not considered in the PCA method. 
The fatigue model relates the log of allowable load repetitions versus the stress-to-strength ratio 
and is given by

In the AASHTO Road Test, the principal mode of failure was the erosion or pumping of the granu￾lar base supporting the concrete slab. Although a positive correlation was not found between corner 
slab defections and performance, a better correlation was found when relating the power or rate of 
work with which a slab corner is defected by a wheel load as a function of the slab thickness, foun￾dation k-value, and estimated pressure at the slab-foundation interface (Huang, 2004).

The solution for the PCA method was originally developed for hand solutions with charts and tables. 
The procedure was developed using the results of the fnite element computer program JSLAB 
(Tayabji and Colley, 1986) to determine the critical stresses and defections induced in concrete 
pavements by joint, edge, and corner loading. The PCA method considers the degree of load transfer 
provided by dowels or aggregate interlock and the degree of edge support provided by a concrete 
shoulder. 
The PCA (1984) design procedure is presented in depth by Huang (2004) and others, with com￾plete tables and charts and worksheets to use with the tedious hand calculation method. The PCA 
design procedure and charts will not be provided here. The PCA software PCAPAV or StreetPave 
was developed and can be used to quicken the process. Although the PCA design procedure is not 
as commonly used for highways compared to the AASHTO method, it still is used for lighter duty 
pavements, and used to develop design tables for parking lots (ACI Committee 330) and for streets 
and local roads (ACI Committee 325). 
An example from the PCA (1984) Design Guide will be summarized here (Table 16.26).

Fatigue analysis 
A doweled pavement has a thickness = 9.5 in. 
k for subgrade = 130 pci 
Equivalent stress for single axle = 206 psi 
Equivalent stress for tandem axle = 192 psi 
Concrete modulus of rupture Sc = 650 psi 
Stress ratio single axle = 206/650 = 317 
Stress ratio tandem axle = 192/650 = 295 
Projected 30 kip single axle loads = 6310 
Load safety factors (LSF) = 1.2 for interstate highway 
30 k × 1.2 = 36 kip single axle 
Using PCA (1984) Nomograph 
For 36 kip single axle; stress ratio = 0.317; allowable load repetitions = 27,000 
% fatigue life consumed = 6,310/27,000 = 23.3% 
Repeat process for all axle loads 
For 28 kip; % fatigue life = 14,690/77,000 = 19.1% 
For 26 kip; % fatigue life = 30,140/230,000 = 13.1% 
For 24 kip; % fatigue life = 64,410/1,200,000 = 5.4% 
For 22 kip; % fatigue life = unlimited 
Tandem axle 
52 k × 1.2 = 62.4 kip tandem axle 
For 52 kip; % fatigue = 21,320/1,100,000 = 1.9% 
For 48 kip; % fatigue = unlimited 
Total fatigue life used = 23.3 + 19.1 + 13 + 5 + 1.9 = 62.8% < 100% for fatigue; design acceptable 
Erosion analysis 
Use chart for doweled joints, no concrete shoulders 
For a slab thickness = 9.5 in.; k = 130 pci; erosion factors 2.59 single; 2.79 tandem 
For a 36 k single axle; erosion factor 2.59; allowable load = 1,500,000 
For 36 kip;% erosion life used = 6,310/1,500,000 = 0.4% 
Repeat for all axle loads 
Total erosion life used = 38.9% < 100% for erosion; design is acceptable

16.2.4.3 MEPDG Design Guide 
The MEPDG Design Guide (Applied Research Associates, 2004) was developed under NCHRP 
Project 1-37A. The guidelines were introduced in Chapter 14. Similarly for rigid pavements, the 
MEPDG Design Guide evaluates the effects of various pavement materials, traffc loading condi￾tions, design features, and construction practices. It considers both long-term (age) and short-term 
(temperature and moisture) changes in material properties and provides more accurate performance 
predictions so that the frequency of premature failure is reduced. 
A rigid pavement design example showing the use of the MEPDG Design Guide is presented in 
Table 16.27 and Figure 16.16, Figure 16.17, Figure 16.18, Figure 16.19, Figure 16.20, Figure 16.21,

16.2.4.4 Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavements 
Continuously reinforced concrete pavements (CRCP) are heavily reinforced concrete slabs as shown 
in Figure 16.27 that contain continuous longitudinal reinforcement and do not have transverse 
joints except when needed for construction purposes. These include end-of-day construction header 
joints or joints at bridge approaches or transitions to other pavement structures (see Figure 16.28). The

concrete in CRCP will have similar behavior to concretes used for JPCP or JRCP. Meaning that that 
the concrete matrix will undergo similar volume and dimensional changes with changes in tempera￾ture and moisture in addition to traffc load stresses. And since concrete is weak in tension, even new 
concrete pavements will crack if the appropriate induced stress conditions exist. Transverse cracks 
will develop to relieve these tensile stresses that may build up due to normal cement hydration, chemi￾cal shrinkage, and variations in temperature and moisture gradients. These transverse hairline cracks 
can develop through the entire depth of the slab. The continuous steel reinforcement in CRCP is used 
to keep the hairline cracks held tightly together to ensure adequate shear transfer through aggregate 
interlock between contiguous cracked slabs, as well as reduce the applied bending stresses due to traf￾fc loads and due to curling and warping stresses. Following construction of a CRCP, a number of 
mechanisms infuence development of stresses in the slab and thus the formation of cracks. Figure 16.29 
provides a schematic representation of some of the factors infuencing CRCP behavior. During the early 
age, temperature and moisture fuctuations induce volume changes in the concrete that are restrained by 
reinforcement and base friction, leading to the development of stresses and closely spaced cracks. The 
addition of repeated traffc loading and possible undermining of the foundation support can result in the 
typical CRCP distress called punchouts. 
An important factor in preventing punchouts is the use of a non-erodible pavement base material 
to minimize loss of foundation support. Other factors that contribute to reducing the risk of punchouts 
include using an adequate amount of steel reinforcement to maintain tight cracks, reduce load stresses, 
and enhance load transfer across cracks; a minimum slab thickness to reduce traffc load stresses; the 
use of hard angular and large size coarse aggregate with a low CTE to enhance load transfer; the use of 
a bond breaker between slab and base such as plastic sheeting; well controlled concrete mix design and 
concrete curing to avoid over heating of the PCC slab and subsequent cooling and shrinkage stresses 
that develop; and, fnally, tied shoulders and widened lanes (Rasmussen, Rogers, and Farragut [CRCP 
Manual, 2012]). 
Keeping the hairline cracks tightly held together is benefcial since this will prevent water infltra￾tion and prevent the intrusion of incompressibles from entering the cracks and resulting in crack joint 
damage. Crack spacing that develops will vary with concrete properties, environmental conditions, 
wheel loads, and age of the pavement. It’s observed that the crack spacing decreases rapidly during the 
early age of the pavement, up until about 1 or 2years. After this stage, the transverse cracking pattern 
remains constant until the slab reaches the end of its fatigue life. The addition of transverse reinforce￾ment is commonly used to tie any longitudinal cracks that develop. However, longitudinal joints are 
typically used when pavement widths exceed 14ft (CRCP Manual, 2012).

510 Pavement Engineering 
A recent survey on CRCP design practices in the United States (Rasmussen, Rogers, and Farragut 
[CRCP Manual, 2012]) has shown that most states that commonly build and use this type of pavement, 
use the AASHTO design procedure published in 1986 (and later in 1993). One exception is the state 
of Illinois, which uses a modifed version of this method. Therefore, the guidelines referred to in the 
CRCP Guidelines (2012) and summarized here refer to this method as the “AASHTO-86/93” design 
procedure. 
The CRCP Guide (Rasmussen, Rogers, and Farragut [CRCP Manual, 2012]) reports that since the 
development of the AASHTO-86/93 design procedures, a number of new fndings have been reported 
based on research conducted worldwide. These studies on CRCP sections were conducted based on a 
FHWA research studies, LTPP database studies, and others. 
The Design and Construction Guidelines provided in CRCP Manual (2012) (Rasmussen, 
Rogers, and Ferragut [CRCP Manual, 2012]) summarizes some key factors that ensure successful 
CRCP design and construction practices that build upon successful projects in states like Texas 
and Illinois. 
Decisions related to mix design, steel reinforcement design, and construction practices should maxi￾mize load transfer effciency and minimize fexural stresses in the slab. 
Cracks should be closely spaced together but not more than approximately 3–4ft apart; and cracks 
that are held tightly together with a crack width of 0.02in. at the depth of the reinforcement will result 
in a maximized load transfer effciency and minimize fexural stresses, while maintaining steel stress 
below the yield strength. 
Closely spaced cracks with crack widths within 0.02in. will result when CRCP has adequate longitu￾dinal steel content of approximately 0.6%–0.8% of the slab cross-section area, optimum reinforcement 
diameter, adequate lapping of reinforcement splices, reinforcement placed at an appropriate depth, and 
adequate consolidation of concrete around the reinforcement bars. 
Reinforcement design should consider possible fracture and/or excessive plastic deformation. 
Stresses developed in the reinforcement are usually conservative and limited to a stress level usually 
75% of the ultimate tensile strength to avoid fracture and limit the amount of plastic deformation. 
Large, hard, and abrasion-resistant aggregates will force tortuous crack patterns around the coarse 
aggregates and promote good aggregate interlock and thus enhance load transfer effciency. 
Adequate minimum slab thickness is required to accommodate transverse tensile and longitudinal 
stresses due to truck traffc and curling and warping stresses. 
The supporting foundation must be uniform and stable, provide adequate drainage, should extend 
beyond the slab edge through the shoulder area and through special transitions at bridge approaches, 
cuts, and flls. 
As with JPCP, JRCP, the integration of pavement design, mix design, and construction practices used 
for CRCP should maximize load transfer effciency and minimize bending and fexural stresses. 
Concrete curing should be appropriate and adequate to each CRCP application, construction require￾ments, temperature, moisture, and wind conditions. 
Longitudinal construction joints must be tied to adjacent pavement at the centerline or shoulder. 
Longitudinal contraction joints at shoulders should be sawed directly over the transverse reinforcement. 
Similar to JPCP or JRCP, the design of CRCP also involves the dimensioning of a pavement structure 
that includes slab thickness and mix design, construction joints, reinforcement details, slab width, shoul￾ders, pavement transitions, and foundation support that can handle the required traffc loads, climate, 
and environment conditions and provide the expected level of performance at the desired cost. Figure 
16.30 shows the cross-section of a typical CRCP pavement that conforms to good practices observed in 
the feld. 
16.2.4.5 CRCP Design Criteria 
The AASHTO-86/93 Guide recommends controlling crack spacing to fall within 3.5–8ft (1.1–2.4m). 
However, the new CRCP design procedure described in the AASHTO MEPDG does not provide

recommendations on the control of minimum crack spacing. It does however recommend a maximum 
average crack spacing of 6ft (1.8m) and advocates for small crack widths to ensure long-term perfor￾mance (Rasmussen, Rogers, and Farragut [CRCP Manual, 2012]). 
The AASHTO-86/93 guide limits the crack widths to 0.04in. (1 mm) to avoid spalling. Additional 
studies and observations since the AASHTO-86/93 guide have shown that crack widths of 0.024in. 
(0.6 mm) have been found to be more effective in reducing water penetration, minimizing corrosion 
of the steel, maintaining the integrity of the support layers, and ensuring high load transfer eff￾ciency. However, the AASHTO Interim MEPDG predicts and requires a maximum crack width of 
0.020 in. (0.5 mm) over the entire design period (Rasmussen, Rogers, and Farragut [CRCP Manual, 
2012]). 
Table 16.29 shows the maximum allowable working stress for steel with yield strength of 60 ksi 
(420MPa) that is recommended by the AASHTO-86/93 Guide. It can be noted that in some cases, the 
AASHTO-86/93 guide allows a working stress above the yield strength that could result in a possibil￾ity of some plastic deformation. This could result in somewhat wider crack openings when permanent 
deformation is allowed (CRCP Guide, 2012). 
16.2.4.6 Structural Performance 
In mechanistic-empirical design procedures such as those developed for the AASHTO Interim MEPDG, 
structural performance for CRCP is typically expressed in terms of allowable punchouts per unit of dis￾tance (i.e., punchouts/mile) before rehabilitation is needed. 
Recommended threshold values for the allowable number of punchouts are commonly expressed 
as a function of the functional highway classifcation or traffc level. The limit that is selected is also 
a function of the design reliability (risk). The AASHTO Interim MEPDG recommends a maximum 
of 10 medium and high severity punchouts per mile (6 punchouts/km) for interstates and freeways, 15 
punchouts per mile (9 punchouts/km) for primary highways, and 20 (12) for secondary highways. The 
American Concrete Pavement Association (ACPA) recommends a maximum of 10 punchouts per mile 
(6 punchouts/km) for average daily traffc (ADT) greater than 10,000 vehicles/day, 24 punchouts per 
mile (15 punchouts/km) for ADT between 3000 and 10,000 vehicles/day, and 39 punchouts per mile (24 
punchouts/km) for ADT below 3000 vehicles/day (Rasmussen, Rogers, and Farragut [CRCP Manual, 
2012]).

16.2.4.7 Functional Performance 
Like structural performance, functional performance threshold levels in terms of international 
roughness index (IRI) as a function of time or load applications are commonly defned based on 
the functional highway classifcation or traffc level. The AASHTO Interim MEPDG recommends 
a maximum IRI of 175 in./mile (2.7 m/km) for interstates and freeways, 200 in./mile (3.2 m/km) 
for primary highways, and 250 in./mile (4 m/km) for secondary highways. The ACPA recom￾mends a maximum IRI of 158 in./mile (2.5 m/km) for ADT greater than 10,000 vehicles/day, 
190 in./mile (3.0 m/km) for ADT between 3000 and 10,000 vehicles/day, and 220 in./mile (3.5 m/ 
km) for ADT below 3000 vehicles/day. In the AASHTO Interim MEPDG, the threshold value is 
selected based on the design reliability (risk) (Rasmussen, Rogers, and Farragut [CRCP Manual, 
2012]). 
16.2.4.8 Reinforcement for CRCP 
The most common type of reinforcement in CRCP is deformed steel bars. However, other new materials 
including solid stainless steel, stainless steel clad, and other proprietary materials such as fber-reinforced 
polymer (FRP) bars have also been used on a smaller and experimental scale but mostly for dowel bars. 
Stresses generated in the CRCP due to volume changes from the steel to concrete depend on the steel 
surface area and the shape of the surface deformations on the reinforcing bar (rebar). Therefore, it is criti￾cal that the rebar used comply with requirements specifed in AASHTO M 31, M 42, or M 53 for billet￾steel, rail-steel, or axle-steel deformed bars respectively. Alternatively, ASTM A 615 for billet-steel, and 
ASTM A 996 for rail-steel and axle-steel deformed bars may be used (Rasmussen, Rogers, and Farragut 
[CRCP Manual, 2012]). 
Bar designations as well as requirements for deformations and steel tensile strength or steel grade are 
provided in both the AASHTO and ASTM specifcations. Table 16.30 shows weight and dimensions of 
ASTM standard reinforcing steel bars. The required yield strength of reinforcing steel for use in CRCP 
is typically 60,000 psi (420MPa), designated as English Grade 60 (metric Grade 420). Higher strength 
steels may be used, but this does not imply that the concrete cracks will be held tighter together. This 
function of controlling crack widths still depends on the MOE or stiffness of the steel which is still 
around 29 million psi. 
Another property of interest for CRCP reinforcement design is the coeffcient of thermal expansion of 
the steel. Depending on the difference in the steel and concrete CTE, varying restraint will result, leading 
to different crack patterns. The AASHTO 86/93 guide recommends the use of a steel CTE of 5×10−6 in./

in./in./°F and 11 to 12×10−6 m/m/°C. 
16.2.4.9 Design Methods for CRCP 
In the past, it was common practice by some states to design CRCP thickness based on jointed concrete 
pavement methodology and then reduce the thickness by as much as 20% to account for the effect of 
increased load transfer effciency at the cracks. In some cases, this resulted in an under-design with 
subsequent failure. This practice is no longer being applied. Today, typical CRCP thicknesses vary from 
7 to 15in. (178–381mm) depending on the level of traffc and environmental conditions, although most 
common practice is between 10 and 12in. (254–305mm) (Rasmussen, Rogers, and Farragut [CRCP 
Manual, 2012]). 
The two most common design methods for determination of slab thickness and the amount of rein￾forcement required in CRCP are the (1) ASSHTO-86/93 Guide for Design of Pavement Structures, and 
(2) the AASHTO Interim MEPDG. 
16.2.4.10 AASHTO MEPDG 
The National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) has taken the lead on a major effort 
to develop the next generation of pavement design procedure based on mechanistic-empirical methods. 
This has been conducted under the funded research project 1-37A and has resulted in the proposed 
AASHTO Interim MEPDG. In this design procedure, specifc mechanistic-empirical models for predic￾tion of CRCP performance have been developed. Figure 16.31 shows the fow diagram of the AASHTO 
Interim MEPDG CRCP design process. The process starts with the selection of a trial design includ￾ing layer thicknesses, materials, reinforcement, shoulder characteristics, and construction information. 
Site-specifc conditions including environment, foundation, and traffc are also considered. Performance 
criteria in terms of punchouts and IRI are then specifed along with the reliability level for each criterion. 
The MEPDG also has limiting design criteria on crack width (over design period), crack spacing, 
and crack load transfer effciency (over design period as well). The procedure predicts punchout failure 
development as a function of the crack width and load transfer effciency due to aggregate interlock at 
transverse cracks. Stresses due to loading are predicted as a function of load transfer effciency at cracks, 
and they continuously evaluated and modifed throughout the design period. Fatigue damage as a func￾tion of the stress level and concrete strength is evaluated and accumulated and punchout development is 
subsequently predicted. Pavement roughness using the summary statistic in IRI values is also predicted 
throughout the design period as a function of the initial smoothness conditions, punchout development,

and site-specifc conditions. Once the trial design is evaluated, its predicted performance is checked 
against design criteria at the specifed reliability level. If the design requirements are satisfed, the trial 
design is considered as a viable alternative that can later be evaluated in terms of life-cycle costing. 
Otherwise, a new trial design is evaluated (Rasmussen, Rogers, and Farragut [CRCP Manual, 2012]). 
16.2.4.11 AASHTO-86/93 Design Procedure 
The AASHTO-86/93 Guide procedure for CRCP uses the same consideration as for jointed concrete 
pavements. It does not, however, consider punchout failure which is a major CRCP distress. In addition,

due to the heavy reinforcement which keeps the cracks tight in CRCP, an improved load transfer coef￾fcient is commonly used, which typically results in a moderate reduction in thickness for this pavement 
type under similar traffc and environmental conditions. 
The AASHTO-86/93 method also includes design procedures for the selection of steel reinforcement 
in CRCP. These procedures are based on a desired range of crack spacing, maximum crack width, and 
maximum steel stress. It should be noted that it has been reported that this design procedure tends to 
underestimate the required steel. 
16.2.4.12 Reinforcement Design 
Reinforcement design for CRCP involves selecting the proper percentage, bar size, and bar confguration 
for optimum CRCP performance. Proper reinforcement design provides the minimum reinforcement 
necessary to develop the desired crack spacing and desired crack widths, while maintaining the steel 
stresses at an acceptable level. 
Longitudinal steel reinforcement content is defned as the ratio of the area of longitudinal steel to the 
area of concrete (As/Ac) across a transverse section, commonly expressed as a percentage. Figure 16.32 
shows a conceptual design approach for CRCP showing higher amounts of steel reinforcement will result 
in shorter crack spacings, smaller crack widths, and lower steel stresses. An increase in the percent of 
longitudinal reinforcement will result in an increase in restraint. As the level of restraint increases, so 
does the number of cracks that develop, resulting in shorter crack spacings. In addition, as the amount of 
reinforcement increases, the average steel stresses are reduced, producing less reinforcement elongation 
(Rasmussen, Rogers, and Farragut [CRCP Manual, 2012]). 
16.2.4.13 Design Variables for Longitudinal Reinforcement: AASHTO Method 
The input variables required for the design of longitudinal reinforcement in CRC pavements are pre￾sented next.

516 Pavement Engineering 
16.2.4.13.1 Concrete Tensile Strength 
The 28-day concrete indirect tensile strength as determined using ASTM C 496 or AASHTO T 198 
splitting tensile should be used to determine the longitudinal steel reinforcement. The indirect tensile 
strength may be approximated from the modulus of rupture or the fexural strength used for thickness 
design from the third-point loading test. The indirect tensile strength can be approximated as 86% of the 
modulus of rupture value at 28days. 
16.2.4.13.2 Concrete Coeffcient of Thermal Expansion 
The coeffcient of thermal expansion for concrete depends on a number of variables such as the mix 
design, the water-cement ratio, the duration of curing, the relative humidity and moisture content, and 
coarse aggregate type. But the most infuential factor is the type of coarse aggregate since it occupies a 
signifcant volume of the concrete. Values of the coeffcient of thermal expansion for Portland cement 
concrete as a function of aggregate type is provided in Table 16.31. 
16.2.4.13.3 Reinforcing Bar Diameter 
Typical bar sizes used in CRCP range from # 4 (0.5 in.) to # 7 (0.875 in.) (#13 [13 mm] to # 22 [22 
mm]) (Rasmussen, Rogers, and Farragut [CRCP Manual, 2012]). 
16.2.4.13.4 Steel Coeffcient of Thermal Expansion 
A steel CTE of 5±10−6 in./in./°F (9±10−6 m/m/°C) is recommended for longitudinal reinforcement 
design unless specifc knowledge of the CTE for the steel to be used in the project is known. 
16.2.4.13.5 Design Temperature Drop 
The design temperature drop is determined based on the difference between the average concrete curing 
temperature after placement and a design minimum temperature and can be expressed as: 
Design temperature drop, ΔTD = TH − TL 
TH is the average daily high temperature during the month the pavement is constructed 
TL is the average daily low temperature during the coldest month of the year where the CRC pave￾ment will be constructed 
16.2.4.13.6 Concrete Drying Shrinkage 
Concrete drying shrinkage is an important design parameter for design of the reinforcement for CRCP. 
Concrete shrinkage depends on many factors, but ultimately it depends on the properties of the paste 
phase and the moisture and temperature environment of the concrete. The water content, the water￾cement ratio, and the strength will affect the shrinkage greatly. A correlation between the indirect tensile 
strength of the concrete and shrinkage is presented in Table 16.32.

16.2.4.13.7 Wheel Load Tensile Stress 
The wheel load tensile stresses that develop in the concrete pavement due to construction traffc or wheel 
loads during its early age may impact the crack spacing pattern and should be accounted for in longitudi￾nal reinforcement design. Figure 16.33 shows an example of wheel load stress as a function of the design 
slab thickness, magnitude of wheel load, and effective k-value. 
16.2.4.14 Limiting Criteria 
There are three limiting criteria that are considered for the design of longitudinal steel in CRCP. These 
include crack spacing, crack width, and stress developed in steel.

1. Limiting crack spacing between 3.5 and 8ft (1.2 and 2.4m) for the purpose of reducing the risk 
of punchout failure. 
2. Limiting the width of cracks to 0.04in. (1mm) for reducing the risk of water infltration and 
concrete spalling. According to Huang (2004), this can be accomplished by the selection of a 
higher steel percentage or smaller diameter reinforcing bars. 
3. Limiting the steel stress developed to not more than 75% of the yield stress. 
The design procedure adopted by AASHTO was developed by McCullough and Elkins (1979) and 
McCullough and Cawley (1981). The design equations and nomographs are provided in the AASHTO design 
guide. All three criteria must be checked to determine the required percent of longitudinal steel.

16.2.4.15 Longitudinal Reinforcement Design Procedure 
The following procedure should be followed to determine the amount of longitudinal reinforcement 
needed for CRCP. 
If P is greater than or equal to Pmin max , continue with the next step in the design process. When P max 
is less than Pmin, the design is considered unsatisfactory, and the input variables should be modifed until 
Pmax is greater than Pmin. 
The following equations can be used to determine the range in the number of reinforcing bars or wires 
required for design: 
W Ds Nmin ˜ 0.01273Pmin 2 °
W Ds Nmax ˜ 0.01273Pmax 2 °
where 
Nmin is the minimum number of reinforcing bars = reinforcing bar or wire diameter (in or required, 
mm) 
Nmax is the maximum number of reinforcing bars required 
Pmin is the minimum required steel percentage 
Pmax is the maximum required steel percentage 
Ws is the total width of pavement section, in. or mm 
D is the slab thickness (in or mm) 
ϕ is the reinforcing bar or wire diameter, in. (may be increased if potential for corrosion exists) 
The fnal steel design is determined by selecting the total number of bars or wires N; where the value of N 
is a whole number between Nmin and Nmax. To check if the fnal design is appropriate, the number of bars or 
wires may be converted to the percentage of steel P and then used in the equations and nomographs to back￾calculate the approximate values for crack spacing, crack width, and steel stress. 
16.3 COMPOSITE PAVEMENTS STRUCTURAL DESIGN 
For details on recent research and guidelines on analysis, design, and construction of HMA/ 
PCC composite pavements, the readers are referred to the SHRP2 report, S2-R21-RR-2 at 
http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/shrp2/SHRP2prepubR21Volume1.pdf 
The refective cracking part is discussed here as that is the major distress in this type of pavement. It 
is caused by the propagation of cracks through HMA layer—the cracks are initiated by movement near 
the crack and joints in the PCC. The cracks can be due to vertical movement due to loading, horizontal 
movement due to temperature change, or both. The factors infuencing the load induced movements are 
thickness of the HMA layer, thickness, modulus, and load transfer of PCC slab whereas those infuencing 
the temperature elated movements are daily and seasonal temperature variations, coeffcient of thermal 
expansion of both layers, and spacing of cracks or joints. The SHRP2 report mentions that although the 
phenomenon could be modeled and used for design, they encourage the use of the saw and seal method. 
The following model has been proposed in the MEPDG to predict the percentage of refection cracks 
that will refect through a HMA layer over time:

—3)−0.915469 for poor load transfer, a=3.5+0.75 (hac−3), b = −0.68854—3.37302(hac 
NCHRP 669 (http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_rpt_669.pdf) presents the latest 
approach (also, background and software) for the evaluation of the potential of refective cracking. The 
mechanisms considered in this approach include thermal fatigue due to daily temperature change and 
resultant opening and closing of joints and cracks, growth of cracks caused by traffc induced bending of 
the HMA layer above the PCC slab, and crack growth caused by traffc induced shearing of the HMA 
layer above a joint.

Construction of 17 Concrete Pavements 
17.1 OVERVIEW 
The most important aspect of constructing high-quality pavements is producing a quality concrete 
mix that uses good quality materials. The construction process is just as critical for producing 
high-quality pavements. The importance of having skilled contractors, operators, and construction 
personnel cannot be overemphasized. The properties of the fresh or plastic concrete will affect the 
construction operation including mixing, transporting, placing, paving, texturing, curing, and joint￾ing. Early-age properties will affect plastic shrinkage and early-age behavior and should be consid￾ered as seriously as strength requirements. The hardened properties of the concrete will eventually 
affect long-term pavement performance including strength, dimensional stability, and durability. 
In addition, the use of good performing construction equipment and quality skilled operators and 
contractors is critical. Poor materials and poor construction quality will never produce a high￾quality pavement. The importance of having skilled personnel in all aspects of the production, 
construction, and quality control operations is worth emphasizing. A quality control plan must be 
implemented to recognize problems if they arise. Skilled contractors in the production or the paving 
process must recognize and/or anticipate problems arising and be able to make quick changes to still 
yield a positive outcome and an acceptable product. 
Concrete pavements are commonly produced using two types of paving technology: slipform 
paving and fxed form paving. Producing quality pavements that are long lasting requires quality 
concrete, skilled paving contractors, proper placement, consolidation, fnishing, curing, and joint￾ing. Preplanning and coordination between all stakeholders and the project delivery team is critical. 
This will ensure that concrete production, continuous delivery, and paving operations are performed 
as planned and that pavement quality is not compromised. 
Once a concrete mix has been optimized in the lab using trial mixes, feld verifcation should be 
conducted. Depending on the type of paving operation selected, slipform or fxed form paving, feld 
verifcation of concrete mixtures should use the production equipment anticipated for the job and, if 
possible, should also include the construction of a test strip. 
The concrete plant can be either a permanent stationary facility or a portable facility. The deci￾sion will depend on many factors such as access to the volume of concrete production needed, the 
distance from the job, and economical factors. Plant location and setup will depend on site factors 
such as zoning, access to utilities, availability of materials, and public traffc (urban or rural). 
A detailed presentation of concrete paving operations is provided by the AASHTO-FHWA-Industry 
Joint Training Participants Manual, Construction of Portland Cement Concrete Pavements (ACPA, 
1996); The Integrated Materials and Construction Practices for Concrete Pavement: A State-of￾the-Practice Manual, FHWA-HIF-07-004; and other agency specifcations such as the FAA P-501 
(Standards for Specifying Construction of Airports, AC 150/5370-10G (FAA, 2014); Texas Design and 
Construction Manual; http://onlinemanuals.txdot.gov/txdotmanuals/pdm/pav_operations.htm). 
17.2 CONCRETE PRODUCTION 
The production of concrete is a manufacturing process that incorporates different materials with 
inherent variability. Therefore, producing a concrete mix with consistent properties is very impor￾tant. A quality control process should be in place to manage all aspects of material stockpiles, 
ISTUDY526 Pavement Engineering 
transport and delivery, batching, mixing, and concrete delivery. Aggregate stockpiles should main￾tain uniform gradation and moisture content and good coordination between the mixing plant and 
materials supply chain. 
All Portland cement concrete used for pavement applications is ready-mix concrete. ASTM 
C 94-AASHTO M 157 provides the standard specifcations for the manufacture and delivery of 
freshly mixed concrete. Usually customers have a few options regarding the manner in which they 
can order the concrete. A performance-based option is where the customer specifes the strength, 
slump, and air, and the producer selects the mix proportions needed to achieve the desired perfor￾mance. A prescribed option is where the customer specifes the mix proportions; a combination 
option allows the producer to select the mix proportions with the minimum amount of cement and 
strength specifed. 
Batching is the process of combining the mix ingredients to produce the desired concrete. Batching 
is done by either volume or mass. Batching by weight, as specifed in ASTM C 94-AASHTO M 
157, is desirable and yields more accurate measurements since fne sands usually change apparent 
volume with a change in moisture content. Volumetric batching (ASTM C 685-AASHTO M 241) is 
used primarily for concrete mixed in continuous mixers. 
Mixing is the process of mixing all the ingredients thoroughly without overloading the equip￾ment above its capacity. When a concrete is adequately mixed, it should have a uniform appearance 
with all ingredients uniformly distributed. And when samples are taken from different portions 
of a batch, they should have the same slump, density, air content, and coarse aggregate content. In 
a central mix concrete plant, the ingredients are batched into a stationary mixer. The mixer then 
completely mixes the components before discharging the concrete into a delivery vehicle for trans￾porting to the paving site. The delivery vehicle can be a truck mixer operating at low mixing speed, 
a truck agitator, or a non-agitating fatbed truck. A shrink-mixed concrete is partially mixed in a 
stationary mixer, transported, then mixing is completed during delivery in a truck mixer. A truck￾mixed concrete is mixed entirely in the truck mixer during the delivery to the site. 
The challenging aspect about concrete hauling and delivery is negotiating the traffc in congested 
areas. Any delays in delivery could adversely affect the concrete properties and the paving process. 
For example, a constant rate of supply of concrete is needed slipform paving; operations should be 
continuous and moving at a constant rate to produce a quality smooth pavement. Another example is 
that concrete delivery trucks should not be backed up or waiting to deliver the concrete. This could 
affect concrete setting, laydown operations, and compromise or affect the quality of the fnal slab. In 
any event, the complete cycle of mixing, discharging, transporting, and depositing concrete must be 
coordinated for the capacity of the mixing plant, hauling and transport distance, and spreader and 
slip-paver capabilities. Figure 17.1 shows a typical concrete ready-mix plant.

17.3 PREPARATION OF SUBGRADE AND BASE 
Prior to concrete placement and the construction of the PCC slab on grade, preparation of the base 
and subgrade is essential. This includes compacting, trimming, and wetting the subgrade. It is 
assumed that the subgrade has adequate bearing capacity, is suitable for structural loads, and is read￾ied for construction. The subgrade should be moistened in dry conditions so that the dry subgrade 
soil does not draw too much moisture from the concrete. For base placing, the appropriate materi￾als and compaction are important. For bound base, the material could be placed with a paver and 
compacted with rollers. For concrete pavements, it is more critical to have a uniform and consistent 
subbase and subgrade than to have higher bearing capacity. The consistency is extremely important 
in paving operations. Figure 17.2 shows different stages of subgrade and base preparation. 
17.4 PRESETTING REINFORCEMENTS SUCH AS DOWEL BARS, 
TIEBARS, AND CONTINUOUS REINFORCEMENT 
17.4.1 DOWEL BARS 
Dowel bars and tiebars are used to provide support at transverse and longitudinal joints. The use of 
dowel bars for proper load transfer at PCC pavement joints is highly dependent on proper placement. 
Dowels can be placed either before PCC placement by using dowel baskets or after PCC placement by 
using an automatic dowel bar inserter. Incorrect placement of dowels resulting in skewed alignment, 
ISTUDY 
 
528 Pavement Engineering 
shallow positioning, or excessively corroded dowels can cause failure and lead to faulting and crack￾ing at the joints. The placement of dowel bars can be evaluated with nondestructive testing (magnetic 
induction tomography equipment, discussed in Chapter 20). To maintain long-term functionality and 
durability for PCC pavements, dowel bars must be kept in good functioning condition and protected 
from corrosion. This can be accomplished by sealing the joints and minimizing the amount of water 
that can seep through the joint. However, this is impossible to achieve since water will seep through 
the concrete over time and, combined with deicing salts, may corrode unprotected steel bars. Typically 
dowel bars are protected from corrosion by the application of epoxy coating or stainless steel cladding. 
However, the best approach is to have a free draining base, so water does not collect at the joints. 
Prior to placing the concrete, dowels should be lightly coated with a lubricant such as grease or 
oil to prevent bonding with the PCC. Traditionally only half the bar was greased. The FHWA rec￾ommends greasing the entire bar, since partial greasing may still cause a tight bond in one slab and 
prevent free movement (FHWA, 1990). 
Dowel baskets are used to hold dowel bars at the appropriate location and elevation before con￾crete placement. The baskets are simple truss structures fabricated from thick gage wire and are left 
to remain as part of the PCC pavement structure. The FHWA recommends that a minimum of eight 
stakes be used to secure the baskets, and that the steel stakes must have a minimum diameter of 
0.3 in. (8 mm) embedded at least 4 in. (100 mm) in stabilized bases, 6 in. (150 mm) in treated perme￾able bases, and 10in. (250mm) for untreated bases or subgrade (FHWA, 1990). Figure 17.3 shows 
dowel bars preset for PCC pavement construction.

Dowel bar inserters are automated attachments to slipform pavers that allow the paver to insert 
transverse joint dowel bars as part of the paving process. Figure 17.4 shows a dowel bar and tiebar 
inserter. Dowel bar insertion usually occurs after the vibrator but before the tamper bar. Dowel bars 
are placed on the fresh PCC surface, then pushed down to the correct elevation by forked rods. The 
rods are usually vibrated while they insert the dowel bar to facilitate insertion and consolidation 
around the dowels. Regardless of the technique used to position dowel bars or tiebars, the locations 
must be accurately marked for sawing joints later (ACPA, 1995).
17.4.2 tieBars
Tiebars are placed along the longitudinal joint to tie the two slabs together. Tiebars are not consid￾ered load transfer devices and should not be designed as such. Typically, tiebars are deformed bars 
about 0.5 in. (12.5 mm) in diameter and between 24 and 40 in. (0.6 and 1.0 m) long.
Tiebars can be placed into position using chairs ahead of paving or inserted after concrete place￾ment either by hand or using a tiebar inserter attachment in the slipforming process. When one 
lane at a time is paved, tiebars are inserted at mid-slab depth and bent back until the adjacent lane 
is ready to be paved. When using slipform pavers, tiebars are inserted through slab edges that will 
become future longitudinal joints. If two lanes are being paved in one paver operation, then the 
tiebars are inserted or pushed into a mid-slab area that will be cut as a future longitudinal joint 
similar to dowel bar construction. In fixed form construction, standard tiebars or two-piece bars 
with a threaded coupling are inserted through holes in side forms for longitudinal construction 
ISTUDY530 Pavement Engineering 
joints. Proper consolidation of the concrete around these bars is needed. And similar to dowel bars, 
tiebars should be protected from corrosion. Figure 17.4 shows slipform paving with a tiebar inserter.
17.4.2.1 Reinforcing Steel (CRCP)
Proper placement of reinforcing steel is critical to the performance of CRCP. Failures in CRCP and 
inadequate performance are commonly associated with reinforcing steel issues and inadequacies. 
These include insufficient reinforcement bar lapping, inadequate consolidation of the fresh concrete 
around the steel, improper position of the steel in the slab, and extreme hot weather during con￾struction. Placement of reinforcing steel for CRCP can be achieved using the manual method or the 
mechanical method (CRCP Manual, 2012).
The manual method involves hand-placing the reinforcing steel before the fresh concrete is 
placed and finished. The rebar is placed in the proper location using supporting plastic or metal 
anchors called chairs. The chairs must be well anchored with adequate metal stakes to withstand the 
concrete placement and consolidation. Once the chairs are secured, transverse bars are placed on the 
chairs as support for the longitudinal rebar. The longitudinal rebar is placed on the transverse bars 
and secured firmly using appropriate ties, typically every 4–6 ft (1.2–1.8 m). The advantage of the 
hand placement method is that it allows for easy verification of rebar placement, including elevation 
and lap distances. However, the manual method is slower and more labor-intensive than mechanical 
methods. Figure 17.5 shows reinforcing steel before placement of concrete in a CRCP pavement.
Reinforcing steel can also be placed using the mechanical method or using tube feeders. This 
involves placing rebar in a prepositioned location while the paver places and consolidates the fresh

ISTUDYConstruction of Concrete Pavements 531
concrete around it. Great care should be taken to assure proper placement of the longitudinal rein￾forcement since the precision of the mechanical systems could deviate by inches from intended loca￾tions. A double-lift construction method would help in placing the reinforcing steel more precisely; 
however, this method could be costly. Reinforcing mesh or bars for JPCP can also be placed using 
the double-lift method or pushed into the plastic concrete using a mesh depressor (ACPA, 1995).
When connecting two longitudinal rebar together using a splice, these splices should not occur at the 
same longitudinal location. Transverse cracks that occur at the surface of the concrete at the location 
of the splice could cause steel bonding failure, resulting in wide cracks and performance problems. To 
make sure that all the splices do not occur at the same longitudinal location, staggering splices to avoid 
having more than 1/3 of the splices within a 2 ft longitudinal length of each lane of the pavement is 
recommended (Texas Design and Construction Manual; http://onlinemanuals.txdot.gov/txdotmanuals/
pdm/pav_operations.htm). Figure 17.5 shows rebar prepared for skewed splicing (ACPA, 1999, 2002).
17.5 PCC SLAB CONSTRUCTION
17.5.1 sliPform Paving
There are two methods of constructing PCC pavement slabs: using a slipform paver and fixed form 
paving. In slipform paving, the paving train is a term that refers to the combination of mechanical 
systems that place, consolidate, and finish the concrete slab. For highway applications, a typical 
paving train includes a spreader with belt placer, a slipform paver, a texturing machine, and a curing 
cart that is usually combined with the texturing unit (IMCP Manual, 2007). Figure 17.6 shows a

ISTUDY 
532 Pavement Engineering 
typical paving train. The major functions of a slipform paver are to receive and manage the concrete 
head. An auger distributes the concrete uniformly; a striker bar is used to remove excess concrete 
ahead of the vibrators that consolidate and fuidize the concrete for the slipform and the profle pan. 
The paving machine rides on treads (or pad line) over the area to be paved. The paver is guided 
using previously set stringlines and paver sensing wands (or new laser-and GPS-guided sensors). 
Fresh concrete is deposited in front of the paving machine, which then spreads, shapes, consolidates, 
screeds, and foat-fnishes the concrete in one continuous operation. Great coordination between 
concrete production, delivery, and placement is needed to maintain adequate forward progress of 
the slipform paver, which is required for producing smooth pavements. Slipform paving is an extru￾sion process that uses very low slump concrete and allows for high-production paving on the order 
of 1 mile (1.6 km) per day. 
Depositing the correct amount of concrete in front of the paving machine (termed the head) must 
be controlled to ensure that it does not get too high or too low. If the head gets too high, it creates a 
pressure surge under the paving machine and could result in a surface bump. If there is not enough 
material in front of the paving machine, then the concrete head may run out or the grout box may 
run empty, creating a low spot and voids or pockets in the pavement surface. Experienced pavers 
can manage the head appropriately by using a placer/spreader machine or by carefully depositing 
concrete from the haul trucks. 
Slipform pavers use mechanical vibration to consolidate the concrete. A series of vibrators fuid￾ize the concrete and remove large air voids. For normal paving operations and common concrete 
mixtures, a frequency from 5000 to 8000 vibrations per minute, at paver speeds greater than 3 ft/ 
min, can adequately fuidize and consolidate the concrete without loss of entrained air or segrega￾tion of large particles. Figure 17.7 shows a typical slipform vibration system (ACPA). 
17.5.2 STRINGLINES FOR SLIPFORM PAVER 
Stringlines are used to guide and provide a reference for the slipform paver and the profle pan. 
The profle pan is the part of a slipform paver that controls the pavement surface. String lines are 
placed along the grade and on both sides of the paver as shown in Figure 17.8. The paver’s elevation

sensing wand rides beneath the string, and the alignment sensing wand rides against the inside of 
the string. The string line material may be wire, cable, woven nylon, polyethylene rope, or another 
similar material. The stakes should be no more than 25 ft apart and closer for horizontal and verti￾cal curves. The resulting smoothness and quality of the resulting pavement surface depends greatly 
on the tolerances and the stability of the stringline construction. Ultimately, the paver follows the 
elevation input from the sensor wand that’s guided by the stringline position. Alternatives to string￾line guiding systems include laser and GPS systems. Also, another system referred to as “locked 
to grade” uses a ski system, which rides off of a previously paved surface (IMCP Manual, 2007).
17.5.3 fixed form Paving
In fixed form paving, stationary metal forms are set, aligned, and staked rigidly on a solid founda￾tion. Final compaction, preparation, and shaping of the subgrade or subbase are completed after 
the forms are set. Forms are cleaned and oiled to ensure easy release after the concrete hardens. A 
variety of fixed form paving machines are available, from simple hand-operated and self-propelled 
vibratory screeds, single-tube finishers, and revolving triple tubes. Other larger and more complex 
form-riding machines can place and consolidate the concrete between forms in one pass. These 
machines ride on the forms or on pipes laid outside the forms (IMCP Manual, 2007). Figure 17.9 
shows typical fixed form construction operations.
The ACPA (1996) recommends the use of metal forms for pavement applications. The forms 
should be stable and may not warp or bulge under the concrete pressure. The metal forms should be 
1/4 in. thick and 10 ft long with adequate flange bracing. The forms should lock together tightly and 
be flush when assembled contiguously. The depth of the forms should be the depth of the slab. The 
tops of the forms should have adequate flange strength to support paving equipment.
17.5.4 ConCrete PlaCement
Concrete should be placed as close to its final location as possible. This holds true for both paving 
types: slipform and fixed form. This is done using concrete-placing equipment. Concrete should not 
be moved excessively once deposited to minimize the potential for segregation. Concrete should not 
be placed in large piles and moved horizontally over long distances since the mortar fraction tends 
to flow ahead of the coarse aggregate and would increase segregation. Figure 17.6 shows concrete 
being placed ahead of the paver using a transfer device.
ISTUDY 
534 Pavement Engineering 
17.5.5 CONSOLIDATION 
Consolidation is the process of compacting the fresh concrete by removing the entrapped air and caus￾ing it to mold without gaps and honeycomb around reinforcement and forms. In a slipform paver, this 
occurs during the vibration phase after the auger and screed operation (Figure 17.7). In fxed form pav￾ing, usually the vibration that a vibratory or roller screed produces is adequate to consolidate the surface 
of most pavement slabs (Figure 17.9b). Additional internal vibration with hand-operated spud vibrators 
is usually necessary for adequate consolidation of unreinforced concrete slabs thicker than 3in. The 
spud or poker vibrators are a fexible shaft vibrator probe, which consists of a vibrating head connected 
to a driving motor by a fexible shaft. An unbalanced weight inside the head rotates at high speed, caus￾ing the head to rotate in a circular orbit. During vibration, the friction between aggregate particles is 
temporarily destroyed and the concrete behaves like a liquid; solids settle under the infuence of gravity, 
and large entrapped air bubbles rise. The vibrated sphere of infuence depends on the vibrator size and 
frequency of operation, and ranges between 3 and 14in. for a vibrator head diameter between 0.75 and 
3.0in., respectively. An insertion time of 5–15s will usually provide adequate consolidation. A vibrator 
head should not be dragged when inserted in the concrete because it will cause segregation. 
Improper vibration may be harmful to long-term durability of the concrete by removing entrained 
air required for freeze-thaw durability. Some effects of under-vibration include honeycombing; 
an excessive amount of entrapped air voids that are called bugholes; sand streaks (which result 
when heavy bleeding washes mortar out from along the form, or due to segregation from striking

ISTUDYConstruction of Concrete Pavements 535 
 
reinforcement steel without adequate vibration); cold joints (from delay in placing adjacent concrete 
lifts or insuffcient vibration of the initially placed concrete before the second lift is added); and 
placement lines or “pour” lines (darker lines between adjacent placement of concrete batches that 
are not knit together due to insuffcient vibration). 
17.5.6 SCREEDING 
Screeding or strike-off is the process of cutting off excess concrete to bring the surface in line with the 
desired slab elevation and grade. This is usually done using a template called a straightedge. This is 
moved across the concrete in a sawing motion with approximately a 1in. surcharge ahead of the straight￾edge to fll in low areas. There are also a number of mechanical systems that use a straightedge combined 
with a vibrator (called a vibratory screed) to ease the consolidation and strike-off effort (Figure 17.6d). 
17.6 FINISHING 
Finishing operations include foating and texturing. However, hand fnishing of the pavement surface 
using bull foats is necessary only where the surface left from the paving equipment contains voids or 
imperfections. Mechanical longitudinal foats should not be overused behind the screed or slipform 
equipment. Commonly, the slip forming operation is optimized to include fnishing. If consistently 
excessive additional hand fnishing is required, then the paving contractor should make concrete mix 
and equipment modifcations. Figure 17.10 shows fnishing operations (IMCP Manual, 2007).

(c) (d)

ISTUDY 
 
 
 
 
 
 
536 Pavement Engineering 
A hand-operated straightedge 10–20ft (3–6 m) should be used for checking the surface behind 
the paving equipment. Successive straightedge checks should overlap by one-half the length of the 
straight edge to help ensure that the tool detects high and low spots in the surface. 
A slight hardening or stiffening of the concrete surface is necessary before fnishing can take 
place. Usually fnishing can proceed when the bleed water sheen has evaporated, and the concrete 
surface can withstand foot pressure with no more than a 1/4 in. depression or indent. 
17.6.1 BULLFLOATING 
Bullfoating is the process of smoothing the surface, leveling off high and low spots, and embed￾ding large aggregate particles just below the slab surface (Figure 17.10). A long-handle bullfoat is 
typically used in pavement construction since the slabs are too wide to fully reach by a short-handle 
darby. For non-air-entrained concrete, a wood bullfoat is used. However, for air-entrained concrete, 
an aluminum or magnesium alloy tool should be used. 
Consolidation, screeding, and bullfoating must be completed before excess bleed water collects 
on the surface of the concrete. Care should be taken to avoid overworking the concrete surface and 
preventing undesirable segregation and increasing the W/C ratio of the concrete surface by incorpo￾rating the bleed water. Increasing the surface W/C ratio has signifcant consequences on durability 
since it may reduce the strength and watertightness and increase the potential for crazing, dusting, 
and scaling. 
17.6.2 TEXTURING 
Texturing is the process of increasing the roughness of the concrete surface to improve trac￾tion, skid resistance, and reduce hydroplaning. The pavement texture also affects tire-pavement 
noise. Texturing of PCC pavements can be achieved using different methods. Dragging a rough 
textured burlap or cloth along the surface produces striations that are 1/16–1/8 in. (1.5–3 mm) 
deep (Figure 17.10). A tining machine drags a metal wire comb-like device or metal rake along 
the transverse or longitudinal direction of the pavement (Figure 17.10). Tining practices will 
vary by state agency; however, many require transverse grooves that are 3–5 mm (0.12–0.20 in.) 
deep, 3 mm (0.12 in.) wide, and spaced 12–20 mm (0.47–0.79 in.) apart. Artifcial turf drag is 
produced by dragging an inverted section of artifcial turf and produces 1.5–3 mm (1/16–1/8 in.) 
deep striations. Brooming in the transverse or longitudinal direction uses either a hand broom 
or mechanical broom device that lightly drags the stiff bristles across the surface and produces 
striations that are 1/16–1/8 in. (1.5–3 mm) deep. Other methods such as exposing aggregate by 
washing the surface or diamond grinding and grooving have also been used occasionally (IMCP 
Manual, 2007). 
Texturing should be provided uniformly on the concrete surface and is affected by numerous 
factors such as concrete consistency and workability, the amount of bleed water present on the fresh 
concrete surface, pressure on the texturing tools, tool variability, burlap variability, and cleanliness. 
At times, the area over the future joint locations is not textured in order to provide a good sawing 
and sealing surface (ACPA, 1995). 
17.6.3 PROTECTION OF PAVEMENT SURFACE FROM RAIN 
Rain protection of the concrete should be anticipated, and the contractor should be well prepared 
when it occurs during the concrete-placing operation. When rain occurs, all batching and placing 
operations should stop. The fresh or plastic concrete should be protected by plastic sheeting so that 
the rain does not wash the cement from the surface or indent the surface. Resurfacing should pro￾ceed as needed after the rain stops and operations resume.

(b) fnishing header at joint intersection, (c) location of future joint for header. 
(Courtesy of Wouter Gulden, ACPA-SE Chapter, Duluth, GA.) 
17.6.4 CONSTRUCTION HEADERS 
The construction and fnishing of headers (transverse construction joints) are consistently a poten￾tial problem area contributing to the roughness of concrete pavements. Headers occur at the end of 
a workday or at an interruption for a bridge, intersection, or leave-out. Figure 17.11 shows the fnish￾ing of a construction header at the end of the day. 
The paving machine must stop at these locations, and the most common practice is to place a 
wooden form to create the joint. The forming of a header in this manner increases the chance of a 
bump in the surface due to the hand work necessary to blend the mechanized paving surface with the 
hand-placed area. A “cut back” method can be used to create a joint and avoid hand-forming headers. 
The paver operator continues paving until all of the concrete is used. The following day a transverse 
saw cut is made about 5ft (1.6m) from the end of the hardened concrete slab and dowels are grouted 
into holes drilled into the smooth saw face. This method, when done correctly, produces a smoother 
riding construction joint than is typically achieved with hand-forming. (IMCP Manual, 2007). 
17.7 CURING 
Curing is the process of providing a satisfactory moisture and temperature condition that allows the 
concrete to develop its “timely” desirable properties. Curing allows the hydration process of Portland 
cement and other pozzolanic materials to proceed in a timely manner, avoid plastic shrinkage, drying

shrinkage, thermal stress cracking, and continue with strength gain properties. The amount and rate 
of curing will vary based on the mix properties (specifcally the paste and cement fneness), the mois￾ture and temperature environment at the surface of the concrete, base drainage, the wind velocity, use 
of admixtures and pozzolanic materials, and any other parameters that will affect the cement hydra￾tion process. Curing in a timely manner is critical for pavement slabs since they have a large surface￾to-volume ratio. Improper curing will negatively affect the following properties: strength gain, water 
tightness, abrasion resistance, volume stability due to temperature and moisture, and ultimate dura￾bility with resistance to cycles of freezing and thawing and scaling due to deicing chemicals. 
Curing in a timely manner will depend on the bleeding and the evaporation characteristics at the 
surface layer of the concrete slab. If the evaporation rate exceeds the bleed rate, then the potential 
for plastic shrinkage increases. The average rate of bleeding in kilograms per square meter per hour 
(kg/m2/h) can be estimated by an empirical equation proposed by Poole (2005). 
Bleed Rate(kg/m2/h) = [0.051 * w/cm − 0.015]*h 
where 
w/cm is the water-to-cementitious ratio 
h is the pavement thickness in centimeters 
The evaporation rate in concrete is a function of air temperature, concrete temperature, relative 
humidity, and wind speed. To approximate the evaporation rate from the surface of a concrete slab, 
the PCA and ACI 308 nomograph shown in Figure 17.12 can be used. This however does not predict 
plastic shrinkage, which is more complex and depends on the environment at the surface of the 
concrete and the behavior of a particular fresh cement paste.

The most common curing method is the application of a liquid membrane. The objective of using 
liquid membranes is to seal the surface and minimize moisture migration into the air. This in turn 
reduces the potential for plastic shrinkage, drying shrinkage, slab curling, and warping. A liquid 
membrane-forming compound that meets ASTM C 309/AASHTO M 148 material requirements 
and application rate of 200 ft2/gal (5.0 m2/L) is adequate for most normal paving situations (ACPA, 
1995). Application timing of curing compound is also critical and should be applied as soon as pos￾sible after texturing and just as the water sheen on the surface is disappearing. 
The two common methods used for applying liquid membranes are the sprayer bar and the 
handheld wand. Figure 17.13 shows the application of curing material using the handheld wand and 
(a) (b)
(c)
FIGURE 17.13 Application of curing compound using the (a) handheld wand, (b) sprayer bar, and (c) sprayer bar. 
ISTUDY 
540 Pavement Engineering 
the sprayer bar. The sprayer bar traverses the width of the fnished concrete slab and applies the 
membrane through sprayer jets evenly spaced across the pavement width. The handheld wand is 
person controlled and should only be applied for small surfaces. Due to coloring pigmentation, the 
applied liquid membrane is designed to leave a white residue on the pavement to assist the opera￾tor to be assured of complete surface coverage. The white color can also enhance solar refections 
and minimize slab overheating. It is important that the entire surface is covered, since even a small 
area could be a source of concrete weakness and damage. A single coverage for either method does 
not guarantee complete coverage. However, a double or triple application of liquid membrane can 
lead to an even-covered surface and lower the potential for moisture loss related stresses and plastic 
shrinkage cracking. 
Plastic sheeting used in addition to curing compounds is an effective method in retaining and 
trapping the moisture in PCC slabs and protecting the concrete from cold temperatures and rain. 
Plastic sheeting can also act as a thermal insulator due to the thin air layer trapped between the 
plastic and the concrete. This property can be benefcial if the construction site is subjected to rapid 
cooling following construction. However, it can be detrimental if used improperly. The insulation, 
in concert with the excess heat produced by fast-track PCC mixes, can result in too great a curing 
temperature, causing cracking later when the slab cools. The plastic sheeting must be well secured; 
otherwise, strong winds may cause the sheeting to become insecure and increase the potential for 
slab cooling, temperature shock, and early-age cracking. 
Curing blankets can also be used for curing. Caution should be used when removing curing 
sheeting or blankets from a recently placed concrete pavement. If the concrete is still warm when 
the blankets are removed, and the ambient temperature is low, thermal shock can occur, which may 
cause cracking (Huang, 2004). 
17.8 PAVING IN HOT AND COLD WEATHER CONDITIONS 
Hot or cold weather paving should be planned in advance. This can be achieved by making trial 
batches in the laboratory under similar feld temperature conditions to be aware of anticipated 
changes in concrete properties and anticipate modifcations in paving, fnishing, and curing opera￾tions. Problems that could arise during hot weather concreting include rapid slump loss, reduced air 
content, premature stiffening, plastic shrinkage cracking, and thermal cracking. For cold weather 
paving, the primary concern is to keep the temperature of the concrete above freezing so that 
the hydration reaction and strength gain continues, and to control cracking through proper joint 
placement. 
Planning for hot weather paving conditions should begin as soon as the contractor is aware of 
upcoming hot weather conditions. The contractor should take precautions to limit the evaporation 
rate from the concrete surface. Plastic shrinkage cracking results when the loss of moisture from the 
concrete exceeds the rate of bleed water reaching the surface as described previously. 
If the evaporation rate exceeds 0.2 lb/ft2/h (1.0 kg/m2/h), it is recommended to provide a more 
effective curing application, such as fog spraying, or to apply an approved evaporation reducer such 
as a lithium-based compound. Other precautions include keeping aggregates moist, keeping the 
concrete temperature low by cooling aggregates and mixing water with ice; erecting temporary 
windbreaks to reduce wind velocity over the concrete surface; erecting temporary sunshades to 
reduce concrete surface temperatures. In cases where surface evaporation conditions are extreme 
and plastic shrinkage mitigation efforts are not successful, paving operations should be stopped 
until weather conditions improve. For additional measures to mitigate plastic shrinkage, drying 
shrinkage, and hot weather concreting, refer to ACI 305, Hot Weather Concreting. 
Preplanning for low-temperature concreting should be anticipated in advance as forecasts for 
freezing temperatures are known. Some recommendations for cold weather concreting include the 
use of higher Portland cement content; the use of less pozzolanic materials such as ground, granu￾lated blast furnace slag or fy ash unless they are required for durability; use accelerating admixture 
ISTUDYConstruction of Concrete Pavements 541 
 
but not chloride-based due to potential for corrosion of reinforcement, admixtures will react differ￾ently in cold temperatures and mix trial batches should confrm this. Since strength gain is slow, the 
potential for shrinkage cracking increases. Use heated water and materials, if possible, for the size 
of the pour. The use of insulating blankets is highly recommended for curing the concrete in freez￾ing temperatures, although concrete should not be placed if the air temperature is less than 40°F. 
Strength gain will be delayed due to the slow hydration process in cold temperatures. Joint sawing 
and opening to traffc should be monitored closely to prevent premature failure. For additional 
information on cold weather concreting, refer to ACI 306. 
17.8.1 EDGE SLUMP 
Edge slump is the term referred to when the top edge of a freshly placed, slipformed concrete pave￾ment sags down after the slab is extruded from behind the paver. Figure 17.14 shows the two com￾mon types of edge slump. A small amount of edge slump is more tolerated at the absolute free edge 
of the pavement than along the longitudinal joint, which will have some traffc moving across it. 
The most common form of edge slump is when the top edge slumps down. When the bottom edge 
slumps out, this usually indicates a more serious problem with the mix design and is often associ￾ated with higher slump mixtures that are not appropriate for slipform paving. The factors that affect 
concrete workability, consistency, and rheology will affect edge slip behavior. When this type of 
edge slump occurs, paving should be suspended until the concrete mixture has been modifed to 
work with slipform paving (IMCP Manual, 2007). 
17.8.2 SMOOTHNESS 
Pavement smoothness is important to the traveling public. Smoothness is a measure of pavement 
quality and should be considered seriously in pavement construction. Factors affecting pavement 
smoothness include such things as the construction of a level base and subbase. Horizontal align￾ment, curves, and cross-slopes must be well aligned to minimize roughness. Preconstruction

surveying and staking must be accurate. Embedded fixtures such as manholes and reinforcement 
bars must be well positioned and aligned. The concrete mixture should have the right consistency to 
flow smoothly through the slipform paver. Headers, block-outs, and leave-outs all add to roughness 
and should be minimized if possible. Figure 17.15 shows a smoothness measuring device and the 
output with a simulated straight edge and blanking band.
17.9 JOINTING
After placing and finishing the concrete slab, joints are constructed to control cracking and to provide 
relief for concrete expansion and contraction caused by temperature and moisture changes. Joints 
are usually constructed using special saw-cutting equipment. If designed and constructed properly, 
joints in concrete pavements create vertical weakening planes in the concrete pavement to induce 
controlled cracks just below the saw cut. Properly constructed joints will be easier to maintain than 
uncontrolled random cracks. Once PCC joints have cured sufficiently, they should be cleaned and 
sealed with jointing compound to prevent noncompressible foreign debris from harming the con￾crete’s contraction and expansion cycle. The FHWA HIPERPAV software (FHWA, 2005) provides 
guidelines for timing joint construction based on concrete properties and environmental conditions.
FHWA (2005) recommends that joint sawing should be timed correctly before stresses develop 
in the pavement that are large enough to cause cracking. These stresses are the result of restrained 
volumetric changes from both temperature and moisture changes in the new pavement. Joint con￾struction should not begin until the new PCC pavement has gained enough strength to support the 
weight of the sawing equipment and operator and to minimize excessive raveling due to the forces 
introduced by the cutting blade. This provides a short window where the concrete conditions are 
right for joint sawing.
Selecting the appropriate time to saw a joint is influenced by many factors, including mix proper￾ties, weather, subbase, and the type of sawing and saw blade. Concrete mixtures that increase the 
potential for plastic shrinkage will shorten the potential window for joint sawing. This includes 
mixes with a high water demand, more fine materials, and a small maximum coarse aggregate size 
that reduces the amount of course aggregate in the mix. Large weather changes that may increase 
the potential for rapid moisture evaporation from the surface of the concrete will also increase the 
potential for plastic shrinkage cracking and therefore shorten the window for joint sawing. This 
includes sudden temperature drop or rain shower, sudden temperature rise, high winds and low 
humidity, cool temperatures and cloud cover, and hot temperatures and sunny conditions.

The coarse aggregate type infuences the temperature sensitivity of the concrete. Concrete that is 
more temperature sensitive with high CTE will expand or contract more with temperature change, 
which increases cracking potential. A dry and porous base will have similar effects of drawing 
moisture from the concrete. The friction level between the concrete slab and the subbase has an 
effect on the plastic shrinkage potential. A large friction level and a strong bond between the con￾crete slab and subbase will shorten the window for successful joint operations. Figure 17.16 shows 
joint sawing operations in PCC pavements. 
17.10 HIPERPAV SOFTWARE 
HIPERPAV (HIgh PERformance concrete PAVing) is a simulation tool of early-age concrete pave￾ment behavior (Ruiz et al., 2001). The software was funded by the Federal Highway Administration 
(FHWA) and developed by The Transtec Group, Inc. (Qinwu et al., 2009) Version III of HIPERPAV 
can be downloaded free of charge from www.hiperpav.com/. 
The HIPERPAV software simulates how pavement design features, materials, climate, and con￾struction procedures impact strength and stress development and predicts the potential for crack￾ing. The predicted concrete temperatures drive a number of key behavior models in HIPERPAV 
including strength and stiffness gain (based on the Arrhenius maturity concept), creep, and thermal 
expansion properties. The software can be used to manage pavement early-opening to traffc, opti￾mal mix characteristics, saw-cutting windows, and curing methods for specifc conditions. 
ISTUDY544 Pavement Engineering 
The HIPERPAV program models the behavior of concrete given numerous inputs about the con￾crete materials, construction information, climate information, and slab-base restraint. 
The HIPERPAV program estimates the allowable stress, which is the predicted strength develop￾ment over the initial 72h and the applied stresses developed due to climate and restraint conditions. 
If the predicted stress exceeds the allowable stress, then cracking conditions are favorable and are 
indicated as likely to occur. Therefore, it is recommended that changes to the concrete mix, con￾struction practices, and/or protection from the environment must be made. 
HIPERPAV III includes several improvements over versions I and II and include the following 
(Qinwu et al., 2009): 
Simple versus advanced strategy view: The user can toggle between simple view (less inputs) 
and advanced view (more inputs). In the simple view, a minimum number of inputs are required for 
an analysis and all other inputs are estimated by the software that reduces the time for analysis. In 
the advanced view, more input parameters are needed for a more detailed analysis. For example, 
some of the input parameters required include axial restraint, PCC stiffness, PCC drying shrinkage, 
maturity, and heat of hydration. 
Multiple strategy batch mode: Multiple strategies can run at once by selecting “batch mode” 
from the strategy menu. 
Quick compare: The quick compare screen offers the user options to quickly make comparisons 
of up to four strategies simultaneously. Once the strategies of interest are selected, the user can 
compare differences in input data, strength, stress, and cracking risk plots. 
Sensitivity comparisons: Multiple sensitivity analysis can be performed varying one input at a 
time for a given base case strategy. 
Enhanced moisture characterization: HIPERPAV III uses a one-dimensional fnite-difference 
model that relates materials, environmental effects, and curing procedures to predict the poten￾tial for PCCP early-age cracking due to moisture changes. This is a signifcant enhancement over 
HIPERPAV versions I and II. Changes in moisture content in the concrete are the result of drying due 
to hydration, evaporation, or moisture transport into the base or subbase. Moisture removal from the 
concrete results in concrete shrinkage. Concrete shrinkage, coupled with temperature gradients, may 
cause axial, curling, and warping stresses in the concrete and the potential for early-age cracking. 
Heat evolution characterization: HIPERPAV III characterizes the heat of hydration of concrete 
mixtures from semi-adiabatic calorimetry testing. This is an improvement over previous versions 
and improves the software accuracy in predicting thermal stress and strength development. 
A brief demonstration of the software is presented here by showing an example and selected out￾put windows, starting with an example for an Early Age JPCP using default values in the software. 
Strategy information window: Information and background is logged in this window. 
Design window: Reliability can be a set or defaults at 90%. Information on slab geometry, 
joint spacing, and slab support is provided (see Figure 17.17). The window shows a 10 in. 
slab, with 15 ft joints and a smooth asphalt base. 
Mix design window: Information on the concrete mix design, type of cement, binders and 
admixture, strength at 28 days is provided (see Figure 17.18). 
Construction window: Information on concrete initial mix temperature, layer support tem￾perature, curing method, saw-cutting, and strength gained for opening to traffc is provided 
(see Figure 17.19). 
Climate window: From the location of the project, climate data are provided from a database 
and maybe updated hourly for analysis (see Figure 17.20). 
Analysis window: The analysis is performed based on all previous inputs. Figure 17.21 shows 
strength gain development in the concrete (top curve) and the tensile stress built in the con￾crete (bottom curve) for the frst 72h after construction. The evaporation rate analysis during 
the plastic state is also presented on the same window. The two strength and stress curves 
are intersecting at 17h after construction and the stress exceeds the concrete strength. This 
ISTUDYConstruction of Concrete Pavements 545 
indicates a high risk for cracking and merits investigating a change in mix design and/or 
construction process. Changing the base conditions from a rough asphalt base to a smoother 
asphalt base changes the stress versus strength prediction curve and the risk for cracking is 
reduced. The design engineer can change numerous variables and evaluate the parameters that 
will signifcantly increase the risk for cracking. HIPERPAV III is a powerful tool but should 
be used with caution and should be coupled with local experience if possible. Numerous SHA 
are using this tool in the design and construction process, including Texas and Ohio DOT.

17.11 JOINT SEALING 
The purpose of sealing joints is to minimize infltration of surface water and incompressible mate￾rial into the pavement layers (ACPA, 1993). Excess water contributes to subgrade or base softening, 
erosion, and pumping of subgrade or base fnes over time. This degradation and erosion results in a 
loss of structural support, pavement settlement, and/or faulting. 
Sealing of joints prevents hard or incompressible objects from entering joint reservoirs. During 
hot weather when slabs need to expand and joints need to move, stresses develop when hard incom￾pressibles restrict this movement. Incompressibles contribute to spalling and, in extreme cases, may 
induce blowups. In either case, excessive pressure along the joint faces results as incompressibles 
obstruct pavement expansion in hot weather. 
There are many types of materials that are acceptable for sealing joints in concrete pavements. 
Sealants are either placed in a liquid form or are preformed and inserted into the joint reservoir. 
Sealants installed in a liquid form depend on long-term adhesion to the joint face for successful 
sealing. Preformed compression seals depend on lateral rebound for long-term success. 
The selection of an appropriate sealant material depends on the environment of use, perfor￾mance, joint type, and spacing and cost. Figure 17.22 shows different forms of joint sealant. 
The following factors affect the function and the performance of some joint sealants. 
Concretes with a large CTE and containing harder coarse aggregates, such as gravel or granite, 
will expand and contract more with a given temperature change than a concrete containing 
limestone. Therefore, the sealant material will be strained more and stretched farther for a given 
joint spacing. An appropriate shape factor (width/depth ratio) for the sealant is recommended. 
Silicone sealants are known to have poor adhesion to concrete containing dolomitic lime￾stone. Use of a chemical primer application to the sealant reservoir walls will ensure that 
the silicone adheres and functions. 
A reservoir shape factor (width/depth ratio) of one is recommended for hot-poured asphalt￾based sealants. 
Silicone and two-component cold-poured sealants typically need a reservoir shape factor of 0.5. 
Compression sealants are selected such that the maximum compression of the seal is 50% 
and the minimum is 20% through the anticipated ambient temperature cycles in the area.

17.11.1 QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QC/QA) 
As discussed in Chapter 13, quality assurance (QA) is the set of tests and activities conducted by the 
owner or highway agency to confrm that the product delivered is in compliance with the specifca￾tions. AASHTO defnes quality assurance as “All those planned and systematic actions necessary 
to provide adequate confdence that a product or service will satisfy given requirements for quality.” 
Quality control (QC) is the set of tests and activities conducted by the contractor or service pro￾vider to monitor the process of material delivery, batching, placing, and fnishing the concrete to be 
sure that the pavement will meet the minimum QA test criteria. 
QA testing can be done for acceptance by the owner, or it can also be done by the contractor 
and verifed by the owner. As presented in Chapter 16, statistical acceptance procedures, such as 
percent within limits (PWL) specifcations, should be used to monitor the QC process continuously. 
For example, a target air content can be specifed at 6%; however, a ±95% range could be between 
4.9% and 7.3%. The QC/QA operators should keep good records that will track the test results and 
are able to fag the problem areas as they become evident. Typically the tests used are those that can 
be easily verifed such as air content, strength, thickness, and smoothness. Others that are equally 
important such as distribution of voids and curing tests are less emphasized. 
A suite of tests for use during the planning and construction of concrete pavements has been 
identifed in the TPF-5(066) project (Fick, 2008), and some of the tests are presented in Table 17.1. 
The recommended test methods should be used during the three phases of a mix’s evolution during

stage. The tests are categorized according to fve concrete properties: workability, strength develop￾ment, air content, permeability, and thermal movement. Some of these tests are briefy described 
here. The fnal tests selected for a project will depend on the magnitude of the project and the needs 
for the QC/QA program. 
17.11.2 DIFFERENTIAL SCANNING CALORIMETER (DSC) 
The DSC is used to determine the form and content of calcium sulfate in the cement. Setting prob￾lems associated with false set and fash set are caused by unbalanced amounts of gypsum (calcium 
sulfate dihydrate) and plaster (calcium sulfate hemi-hydrate). Monitoring the level of calcium sulfate 
and adjusting the mix appropriately will prevent setting problems during construction, strength 
development, and long-term durability. 
17.11.3 BLAINE FINENESS 
The fneness of cement affects the rate of reaction and cement hydration, water demand, workabil￾ity, strength gain, and permeability. Monitoring the cement fneness will provide for better quality 
control in adjusting for mix water and potential strength gain. Monitoring the cement fneness and 
adjusting the mix and curing conditions accordingly will reduce the variability in concrete pro￾duced and resulting pavement quality.

550 Pavement Engineering 
17.11.4 GRADATION 
As mentioned earlier, the gradation of the aggregates will have a big infuence on the plastic prop￾erties of the concrete. The gradation will infuence the workability, water demand, cement paste 
requirements, segregation, bleeding, and ultimate shrinkage. A uniform gradation with all particles 
coated with a paste layer is a desirable outcome for a rigid pavement concrete. 
17.11.5 PENETRATION RESISTANCE 
Some Portland cements and cement blends can experience false set. False set is the condition when 
the concrete loses workability without strength gain. Remixing of the concrete without the addition 
of water can restore workability. Performing the penetration resistance test can provide valuable 
information on whether a particular cement may be prone to false set. 
17.11.6 CEMENT MATERIALS TEMPERATURE PROFILE (THE “COFFEE CUP TEST”) 
When Portland cement hydrates, it generates heat. The coffee cup test is a simple test to monitor the 
chemical reaction during the hydration process. Variations in the temperature profles may indicate 
problems with cement hydration, workability and uniformity, and compatibility with admixtures. 
17.11.7 WATER-CEMENT RATIO (MICROWAVE OVEN TEST) 
The water-cement ratio of the resulting concrete mix has a big infuence on the ultimate strength 
and durability of the hardened concrete. The microwave test method provides a quick way (within a 
couple hours) of determining the water-cement ratio. A concrete sample is dried in the microwave 
oven. From the moisture content and assumptions that the sample tested is representative of particu￾lar concrete mix, then the w/cm can be determined. 
17.11.8 CONCRETE AND SUBGRADE TEMPERATURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS 
Temperature and environmental conditions have a big effect on early-age concrete behavior and 
ultimate strength gain. Monitoring temperature and project temperature and weather conditions 
will allow the pavement construction decisions makers to respond appropriately and minimize 
problems that would be detrimental to the concrete’s strength gain and long-term durability. For 
example, knowing the temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, solar radiation, and tempera￾ture changes will affect the rate of drying, setting time, and strength gain of the concrete, changing 
the saw-cutting window will reduce the chances of cracking and curling in the slab. 
17.11.9 CONCRETE STRENGTH (EARLY AGE) 
Assessing the concrete strength at an early age is a good indicator for concrete quality and the 
potential for carrying stress. Concrete strength, however, should not be taken as a guarantee for 
durability and long-term performance. A concrete with adequate strength, for example, may not 
have the correct entrained air volume and air bubble size distribution, and would perform poorly 
under freeze-thaw conditions. Details of concrete compression and fexural testing have been pre￾sented in Chapter 15. 
17.11.10 AIR VOID ANALYZER 
The air void analyzer (AVA) is a sophisticated testing apparatus that can determine the air void 
system in fresh mortar. The AVA determines the air void distribution by taking the mortar 
ISTUDYConstruction of Concrete Pavements 551 
 
fraction of the concrete and stirring it gently in a solution. The air bubbles are released and rise to 
the top where they are captured by a submerged bowl. A very sensitive scale monitors the change 
in mass of the bowl as its buoyancy changes. According to Stokes Law, the larger bubbles will 
rise faster than the smaller bubbles, and this theory is used to estimate the air size distribution 
of the fresh concrete. The test equipment was developed under the SHRP program in the 1990s. 
Since the freeze-thaw resistance of concrete depends largely on the spacing factor of the air void 
system, knowing this while the concrete is still plastic would provide the decision-makers dur￾ing the construction project a powerful tool to reject inferior concrete that could become a big 
problem later on. 
17.11.11 MATURITY TEST 
The maturity test is a nondestructive test method for estimating in-place concrete strength. The 
maturity method can be used as criterion for opening a pavement to traffc, for estimating strength 
gain, and for quality control purposes. The principle behind the maturity test is that strength gain 
of concrete is a function of time and temperature that follows the extent of cement hydration in a 
given mix. Therefore, samples of the same concrete will have equal strength if they have the same 
maturity index independent of their actual time histories. 
The maturity curve is developed by casting, curing, and testing standard strength specimens 
while measuring and recording the temperature of those specimens over time (ASTM C, 1074). 
The maturity index is computed by the summation of the time interval times the temperature. Only 
temperatures above 14°F are used in the maturity index since hydration is virtually inactive at very 
low temperatures. 
In the feld, a maturity test is conducted by inserting a temperature probe in the concrete 
slab as shown in Figure 17.23. A computerized data acquisition system is used to download the 
slab temperature data, which is then compared to the maturity curve. The maturity correlation 
FIGURE 17.23 Field testing of concrete temperature using the maturity test.

ISTUDY552 Pavement Engineering 
curves are developed for a particular mix design that estimate concrete strength based on its 
maturity. 
The procedure for developing the maturity correlation curve for a specifc concrete involves the 
following: 
Cast at least 15 strength specimens from a mixture that will be the same as what will be used 
for pavement construction. 
Embed temperature sensors in at least two of the specimens. These specimens are used only 
for recording the temperature over time and will not be broken. 
Cure all the strength specimens in the same location with exposure to a constant temperature 
and similar relative humidity. 
Test the strength of the specimens at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days. Break and average three specimens 
at each age. 
From the temperature data, determine the maturity index for each set of strength specimens. 
Plot the strength and Maturity Index data for the strength specimens on a graph, with Maturity 
Index on the x-axis and concrete strength on the y-axis. 
Fit a smooth curve through the plotted points. This can now be used to estimate the strength 
from the feld pavement Maturity Index. 
17.11.11.1 Consistency 
The slump test, ASTM C 143 (AASHTO T 119), is the most commonly accepted method used to 
measure the consistency of concrete (see Figure 17.24). The test is conducted by flling a metal 
conical mold 12 in. high with an 8 in. diameter base and a 4 in. diameter top. The slump cone is 
placed upright on a fat rigid surface, dampened, and flled in three layers of approximately equal 
volume. Each layer is rodded 25 times using a steel rod that is 5/8 in. in diameter and 24 in. long 
FIGURE 17.24 Field testing of concrete consistency using the slump test. 
(Courtesy of James Cable.) 
ISTUDYConstruction of Concrete Pavements 553 
 
with a hemispherically shaped tip. Following the rodding, the last layer is screeded off, and the cone 
is slowly raised in approximately 5± 2 s. As the concrete subsides or settles to a lower elevation, the 
empty slump cone is inverted and gently placed next to the settled concrete (note: any additional 
vibration at this stage will induce additional subsidence in the slumped concrete). The “slump” 
is measured as the vertical distance of the concrete settles, measured to the nearest 1/4 in. Since 
concrete loses slump with time, the entire slump test should be completed in 2.5 min. Note that if 
a portion of the molded concrete falls away or shears off another test should be run on a different 
portion of the sampled concrete. 
17.11.11.2 Air Content 
A number of methods for measuring the air content of freshly mixed concrete are available. ASTM 
standards include the pressure method (C-231; AASHTO T 152), the volumetric method (C-173; 
AASHTO T 196), and the gravimetric method (C-138; AASHTO T 121). The pressure method 
(Figure 17.25) is based on Boyle’s law, which relates pressure to volume. The air pressure meters are 
calibrated to read air content directly when a predetermined pressure is applied. The pressure meter 
method is the most commonly used method for determining air content in fresh concrete. The test 
requires less time than other methods, and the specifc gravities for the concrete ingredients need 
not be known compared to the gravimetric method. The volumetric method is outlined in ASTM C 
173 (AASHTO T 196) and requires removal of air from a known volume of concrete by agitating 
the concrete in an excess of water. The addition of alcohol accelerates the removal of air. The gravi￾metric method is based on determining the density (unit weight) of concrete. The measured density 
of concrete is subtracted from the theoretical density as determined from the absolute volumes of 
the ingredients, assuming no air is present (ASTM C 138 or AASHTO T 121). 
17.11.11.3 Density and Yield 
The unit weight of the concrete is a good indicator of uniformity of a concrete mix from mix to mix. 
The density (unit weight) and yield of freshly mixed concrete are determined in accordance with 
ASTM C 138 (AASHTO T 121). A calibrated known-volume bucket (usually 1/2 ft2
) is flled with 
FIGURE 17.25 Field testing of air content in concrete using the air pressure meter. 
(Courtesy of James Cable.) 
ISTUDY554 Pavement Engineering 
the fresh concrete in approximately three equal layers and rodded 25 times per layer. The quotient 
of weight (or mass in SI units) and volume is the unit weight or density. The volumetric quantity 
of concrete produced per batch is called the yield and is determined by summing the weights of 
all ingredients in the batch and dividing by the density of the fresh concrete. An approximate cal￾culation of the volumetric air in concrete can be conducted by using the density and yield values 
provided the relative densities of the ingredients are known. 
17.11.11.4 Sampling Fresh Concrete 
It is critically important to obtain truly representative samples of freshly mixed concrete for quality 
control tests; otherwise, the test results will be misleading. Samples should be obtained and handled 
in accordance with ASTM C 172 (AASHTO T 141). It should be noted that a sample composed of 
two or more portions should not be taken from the very frst or last portion of the batch discharge 
and should be protected from sunlight, wind, and other sources of rapid evaporation during sam￾pling and testing. 
Concrete for PCC pavements can be produced in one of two ways—dry batch plant and wet (cen￾tral) batch plant. In dry batch plant, the raw materials of PCC are metered (batched) in a plant and 
discharged into a truck, which provided both mixing and transportation. The sequence of discharge 
into the truck consists of water, coarse aggregates, and the remaining materials, and fnally water 
for cleaning and washing materials deposited in the fns and chutes. In the wet (central batch plant) 
the raw materials are metered into a stationary mixer and mixed, and then the mix is discharged into 
a truck. The truck can be with an agitator or mixer set at slow speed. 
Mixing times in dry batch mixing is typically 60–90s, and the factors affecting mixing times 
are gradation, amount of admixture, materials and their proportions, as well as the type of the 
equipment. 
Table 17.2 shows recommendations for maintaining batch to batch consistency. 
PCC required for slipform paving needs to be of low slump that will help the mix retain its com￾posure after extruding from the paver. PCC for fxed form paving needs to be of higher slump that 
will let the mix fll up the forms. 
The factors that dictate the extrusion pressure in slipform paving include weight of the machine, 
side form tapers (as compared to desired pavement edge), angle of the profle pan (compared to the 
desired pavement surface plane), power and frequency of the vibrator, speed of the paver and the 
workability of the mix. 
The placing screed and the vibration frequency should be kept uniform as much as possible, and 
the paver should spread and consolidate the mix as it moves forward consistently and at a uniform 
speed to provide a smooth riding surface. In typical PCC for pavements at paver speed > 3ft per 
minute the vibration frequency ranges from 5000 to 8000 vibrations per minute, to fuidize and 
consolidate the PCC without segregation or loss of entrained air.

The different types of fxed form pavers include those with hand-operated, self-propelled vibra￾tory screeds, single tube fnishers, revolving triple tubes, and form-riding machines. For smooth 
and effcient paving the proper amount of material should be maintained in front of the paver. A 
proper application of oil should be ensured (except on the reinforcements) in the form for removal 
of materials and cleaning. 
For unreinforced slab of thickness >3 in., hand-operated spud vibrators are necessary for ensuring 
proper consolidation of concrete, and its use, along with surface vibration has been recommended 
for slabs of any thickness with reinforcements. Recommended practices of using the vibrator include 
vertical plunges for thick slabs and angled or horizontal placement in thin slabs, avoid dragging the 
vibrator or moving the material with the vibrator and its use for 5–15 s. 
The slipform paver is guided for elevation and alignment through the stringline (wire, cable, 
polyethylene rope, woven nylon) on each side of the paver, against which the elevation sensing wand 
and the alignment sensing and rides in the paver. Stakes, typically 1.5–2.5ft exposed length should 
be used at close spacing (25 ft on tangents) should be used for the string lines. 
Recommendations for using a liquid membrane forming compound (ASTM C 309) for curing 
are 200 ft2/gal for normal paving applications, 150 ft2/gal for fast-track concrete, and 100 ft2/gal for 
thin overlays. 
Generally for low volume roads without paved shoulders, the safety edge of concrete pavements 
is generally constructed as a slope of 1.2:1 to 1.8:1 with a bottom 2in. straight edge, with a shoe 
attached to the paver. 
Placement of PCC under hot or cold conditions require special considerations for avoiding mix 
problems and resultant distresses. The recommendations are given in Table 17.3. 
In addition to proper pre-project planning and communication, Table 17.4 shows the recommen￾dations for the construction of smooth concrete pavements.

Precast Concrete Pavements 18
Pavement rehabilitation in congested urban areas is a serious challenge for highway agencies 
because of construction-related traffc congestion and safety issues. Many transportation agencies 
are struggling with the challenges of pavement reconstruction and repair and traffc congestion 
associated with lane closures. This is especially acute in urban areas where traffc congestion has 
increased tremendously in the past 20 years. Transportation agencies have investigated strategies for 
pavement rehabilitation and reconstruction that are faster but can still produce durable pavements. 
The use of modular pavement technologies, such as precast concrete pavement (PCP) systems, is 
gaining wider acceptance in recent years for rapid repair and rehabilitation of concrete pavements 
as well as for heavily traffcked asphalt concrete pavements and intersections. 
Under the SHRP 2 program, an extensive study on Precast Concrete Pavements (SHRP 2 Renewal 
Project R05, Modular Pavement Technology) was conducted (Tayabji et al. 2013). The study found 
that the use of modular PCP technology has been increasing at a healthy pace over the last 15 years. 
Transportation agencies have recognized the benefts of using precast concrete pavement systems to 
speed up reconstruction on critical roadways that may not allow construction traffc disturbances. 
PCP systems can be installed expeditiously, and roadway sections can be reopened immediately, 
minimizing disruption to the users. However, they also found that although precast concrete pave￾ment technologies exist, there was a lack of shared or available information for transportation agen￾cies on the design, fabrication, and installation of precast concrete pavements. Further, because 
many PCP systems are proprietary, users in this industry have found them diffcult to specify. The 
purpose of this SHRP 2 study was to provide guidance on the design, fabrication, construction, 
and maintenance of precast concrete pavement systems and offers tools to develop a cost beneft 
assessment. In addition, documentation of the performance of precast concrete pavements that are 
currently in service will be of great value to the transportation community. 
Under the SHRP 2 R05 project (Tayabji et al. 2013), sixteen PCP projects at locations with 
a wide range of climates such as the Michigan DOT, Texas DOT, California Department of 
Transportation (DOT), Illinois Tollway, New Jersey DOT, New York DOT, and Utah DOT 
assessed how the PCP systems were used (on ramps, toll plazas, at-grade roadways, and air￾ports). Field surveys included short, intermittent repairs as well as longer, continuous pavement 
applications. It found that modular pavement technology is still evolving, but that over the past 
15 years that it has been used, well-designed and well-constructed PCP systems have provided 
high-quality, long-term service and are often a good choice for rapid repair and rehabilitation of 
existing pavements. The SHRP2 PCP solution offers a series of guidelines and model specifca￾tions to help agencies effectively select projects for PCP and to design, fabricate, and install long￾life jointed and prestressed PCP systems. 
PCP systems consist of high-quality, prefabricated concrete panels that are formed offsite under 
controlled conditions and installed during off-peak travel times. Applications for PCP systems and 
this fexible approach can be used for rehabilitation of existing roadways, urban streets (that can be 
concrete or asphalt pavements), toll plazas, ramps, intersections, bridge approach slabs, tunnels, and 
new roadway construction. Cast in plants under ideal conditions, precast panels are subjected to 
high quality control standards during the fabrication process, which results in a durable and ready￾for-traffc road surface. Smoothness requirement can typically be achieved by routine grinding of 
the panels soon after placement. PCP systems offer transportation agencies short and long term 
advantages, which include: (a) shorter installation time; (b) reduced construction-related lane clo￾sures, which reduced exposure of workers and drivers to work zone hazards; (c) pavement is ready 
for traffc upon installation because no concrete curing is necessary; (d) slabs are cast in plants 
ISTUDY 
 
 
560 Pavement Engineering 
under ideal conditions for optimum quality and durability; (e) installation can take place at night or 
under adverse weather conditions, extending the construction season; (f) typically longer-life per￾formance than traditional cast-in-place (CIP) pavement solutions (Tayabji et al. 2013). 
A number of specifc advantages exist when using PCP systems versus CIP concrete pave￾ments including: (a) concrete quality is better, and there are no issues related to the quality of 
fresh concrete delivered to the project site, CIP paving equipment operations, or achieving a uni￾form placement of concrete; (b) curing of the precast panels occurs under controlled conditions 
at the precast concrete plant which improves concrete curing conditions; (c) minimal weather 
restrictions on placement which extends the construction season as panels can be placed in cooler 
weather or during acceptable light rainfall; (d) on-site curing of concrete is not required, and 
PCPs can be installed during nighttime lane closures and be reopened to traffc the following 
morning which reduces the delay before opening back up to traffc; and (e) elimination of con￾struction-related early-age failures because issues related to early cracking due to late or shallow 
sawing do not develop. 
PCP systems are most effectively used in highway corridors with high traffc volumes and where 
lane closures are diffcult to implement. For production use, PCP work is performed during the 
night. The production rate per lane closure is approximately 15–20 repair locations and about 400– 
600 ft (122–183 m) lengthwise for continuous rehabilitation. The most important issues of concern 
for PCPs are constructability, concrete durability, and pavement performance as primarily affected 
by joint load transfer and panel foundation support condition. Recent advances in PCP technology 
have contributed to reliably achievable high quality: 
• Constructability: where construction techniques and equipment are available to ensure 
acceptable production rates for rapid installation of PCP systems. 
• Durable concrete products: can be attained through plant fabrication of the precast panels 
which can result in high quality concrete with very good strength and durability. 
• Load transfer systems at joints: that are reliable with high quality and economical can be 
incorporated effectively at the transverse joints of jointed PCP systems. 
• Panel support: conditions can be achieved with new construction techniques to provide 
adequate and uniform support. 
• Effciency: panels can be thinner than standard CIP concrete and last longer due to pre￾stressing and/or reinforcing in the panels. 
PCP systems, once they are installed, can be expected to behave similarly to comparable CIP 
concrete pavement systems under similar traffc and environmental loadings. The primary dif￾ference in the two technologies is that PCP technology is a truly rapid rehabilitation technology 
that can also result in longer-lasting treatments. In addition, prestressing techniques allow PCP to 
achieve higher load-carrying capacity within a constrained pavement cross section when recon￾structing existing pavements. 
18.1 PRECAST PAVEMENT APPLICATIONS 
PCP technology can be used for projects of different sizes such as: (a) Localized repair of dis￾tressed areas of existing jointed concrete pavements (JCPs) and continuously reinforced concrete 
pavements (CRCPs). Such distresses may include deteriorated joints and cracks and shattered slabs 
in JCP and punchouts and deteriorated cracking in CRCP. (b) Rehabilitation of shorter lengths of 
distressed concrete pavements; such rehabilitation may include pavement lengths of approximately 
200 ft (61 m) to more than 1,000 ft (305 m) and usually within individual lanes. (c) Rehabilitation of 
longer lengths of existing distressed concrete or asphalt pavements that may extend several miles in 
length and could include more than one lane. 
ISTUDYPrecast Concrete Pavements 561 
 
 
18.2 PRECAST CONCRETE PAVEMENT CONCEPTS 
The application of PCP technology can be classifed into two types of categories: intermittent 
repairs of concrete pavements and continuous application. All systems require use of dowel bar slots 
or ducts. The following propriety or generic systems are available in the United States for jointed 
PCP: The Fort Miller Company, Inc. Super-Slab system; the Illinois Tollway’s generic PCP system; 
the Roman Stone Construction Company’s Roman Road System; the California Rapid Roadway 
System; the Kwik Slab system; and the Caltrans generic PCP system that incorporates a narrow￾mouth teardrop shaped surface slot feature for load transfer at transverse joints. These systems 
have two approaches for dowel slots: the generic top slot and the SHRP2 narrow-mouth top slots 
(one sided or two sided); the Illinois Tollway’s version uses narrow-mouth top slots for repairs (one￾sided); and the Caltrans version of narrow-mouth top slots (one sided). 
18.2.1 INTERMITTENT REPAIRS OF CONCRETE PAVEMENTS 
Under this approach, isolated pavement repairs are conducted using precast concrete slab panels. 
Two types of repairs are possible: 
1. Full-depth repairs (FDRs) are used to repair deteriorated joints or cracking. This repair 
technique can also be used to repair punchouts and deteriorated cracks in CRCP. 
2. Full-panel replacement to replace severely cracked or shattered slab panels. 
These repairs are always full-lane width. The process is similar for FDRs and full-panel replace￾ment, except for the length of the repair area. A schematic model of the repair is shown in Figure 18.1. 
The dowel bars are embedded in the precast panel. Slots for the dowel bars are cut in the existing 
concrete pavement, similar to the dowel bar retroft (DBR) method, as illustrated in Figure 18.2. 
The dowel slots are then flled with fast-setting patching material or grout. In a variation of this 
scheme, no dowel bars are embedded in the precast panel, and dowel bars are installed after panel 
installation using the DBR technique, as shown in Figure 18.3. For alternative intermittent repairs, 
the dowel bars are positioned in the existing concrete pavement by drilling and epoxy grouting. This 
is similar to CIP FDRs or full slab repairs where the slots for the dowel bars are fabricated in the 
repair panels along the bottom of the transverse sides, as shown in Figure 18.4. The slots and the 
joint perimeter gaps are then flled with fast-setting grout material.

To ensure adequate load transfer between panels, appropriate installation of panels and base sup￾port under the panels must be achieved. Some recommended techniques include the following: (a) 
panel placed directly over the prepared base; (b) panel placed and raised to proper elevation using 
expandable polyurethane foam; (c) panel held in place using strong back beams and bedding mate￾rial injected under the panel; and (d) panel positioned at the proper elevation using setting bolts and 
bedding material injected under the panel. 
18.2.2 CONTINUOUS APPLICATION 
Under this approach, full-scale project-level rehabilitation (resurfacing) or reconstruction is per￾formed using precast concrete panels. Under this approach, reconstruction or overlay application of

asphalt and concrete pavements is performed using precast concrete panels. Two types of systems 
have been used in the United States: 
1. Jointed precast concrete pavement (JPrCP) systems 
a. Reinforced concrete panels 
b. Prestressed (pretensioned) concrete panels. 
2. Precast prestressed concrete pavement (PPCP) systems. 
Under SHRP 2 Project R05 study, a third category of continuous PCP systems has been introduced. 
This category is referred to as the incrementally connected precast concrete pavement (ICPCP) 
systems and includes systems that simulate hinged jointed reinforced concrete pavement (JRCP) 
behavior. The panels for the ICPCP systems may be reinforced or prestressed. 
18.2.2.1 Jointed Precast Concrete Pavements 
Jointed Precast Concrete Pavements (JPrCPs) are similar to CIP-JCPs and behave similarly to CIP-JCPs. 
However, some specifc differences that infuence the performance of the JPrCP include the following: 
(a) The panels are installed fat and do not exhibit construction-related, built-in curl or warp behavior; (b) 
The panels incorporate steel reinforcement and any in-service cracking that may develop over time due 
to traffc loading can be tightly constrained; (c) The panel transverse joint faces are smooth (due to fabri￾cation process), and hence aggregate interlock should not be counted on for load transfer at these joints. 
The wide-mouth dowel slots used in this scheme (Figure 18.4) require patching of the dowel slots 
during the same lane closure as the panel installation. The primary reason for not using this scheme 
is not related to performance but to avoid leaving open, wide-mouth slots exposed to highway traffc 
for a few days (Tayabji et al. 2013). 
18.2.2.2 Precast Prestressed Concrete Pavements 
Precast prestressed concrete pavements (PPCP) systems are similar to CIP prestressed concrete pave￾ments (CIP-PCP). These systems incorporate longer lengths of posttensioned sections (PTSections) 
and expansion joints between these sections. The PTSections are formed by posttensioning together a 
series of panels that could vary in length from approximately 150 to 250ft (46–76m). The individual 
panel width may be single lane or multiple lanes, and panel lengths can vary from 8 to 10ft (2.4–3m) 
for multi-lane panels to 10–30ft (3–9m) or more for single-lane panels. The posttensioning of a series 
of panels induces compressive stress in the connected panels that produces a reduction in the panel 
thickness by 2–4in. (50–100mm) compared to a JCP. In addition, because PPCP panel thickness is 
less than that of CIP-JCP or JPrCP, less concrete material is used, which makes this PPCP technology 
cost less in terms of sustainability and with respect to carbon footprint (Tayabji et al. 2013). 
Three types of PPCP systems have been developed in the United States and are presented in 
SHRP2-R05, and summarized in Table 18.1 (shown in Figure 18.5 and Figure 18.6). 
Each panel may also be pretensioned in the transverse or the longitudinal direction, or both, 
during fabrication. During fabrication of the panels, ducts for longitudinal posttensioning are cast 
into each of the panels during fabrication. Pretentioning and posttensioning introduce compressive 
stress in the concrete that helps offset some of the tensile and fexural stress that develop in the pre￾cast panels under traffc and environmental loadings. 
The compressive stress (or the prestress) introduced by the longitudinal posttensioning var￾ies along the length of the PTSection, with a maximum prestress developing at the ends of the 
PTSection and a minimum (effective) prestress developing near the midsection. The reduction in 
the prestress is caused by the panel-base friction and other prestress losses. Therefore, the effective 
prestress in the concrete allows for a reduction in the thickness of the panel for PPCP systems. 
The basic features of the PPCP system are summarized in Tayabji et al. 2013 and presented in 
Table 18.2.

18.3 INCREMENTALLY CONNECTED PRECAST CONCRETE PAVEMENTS 
The Incrementally Connected Precast Concrete Pavements—ICPCP—is a new category of PCP 
systems that has been introduced as part of SHRP 2 Project R05. These ICPCP systems simulate 
a JRCP with hinged joints. They incorporate panels of varying lengths and typically range from 
15 to 30 ft (4.5–9 m). The panels are connected to achieve a continuous section length of 60–100 ft 
(18–30 m). The panels are connected using deformed dowel bars that lock up the connected joint 
and provide the required load transfer across these joints. The advantages of ICPCP are the reduc￾tion in the number of active joints and the use of smaller-width expansion joints. The differences 
between the JPrCP, PPCP, and ICPCP systems are summarized in Tayabji et al. 2013 and presented 
in Table 18.3. 
18.4 PCP LOAD TRANSFER SYSTEM 
As describe earlier, transverse joint faulting can negatively affect ride quality of jointed concrete 
pavements and signifcantly impact the life cycle costs of the pavement in terms of rehabilitation 
and vehicle operating costs. Therefore, effective load transfer devices at transverse joints using 
dowel bars are necessary. The transverse joint spacing should be optimized for intermittent repair 
and for continuous applications by considering the constraints on panel size fabrication, structural 
performance and shipping. Adequate load transfer must be available at all active transverse joints, 
including posttensioned PCP expansion joints to ensure the desired level of service under truck traf￾fc. Tiebars for longitudinal joints may be required to prevent panel or lane drift, particularly for 
continuous panel placements greater than about 15 m.

18.5 TRANSVERSE JOINT SPACING REQUIREMENTS 
Transverse joint spacing requirements for PCP systems are similar to the requirements for cast-in￾place (CIP) concrete pavement: 
Intermittent repairs—Panel length is considered; however, transverse joint spacing is not directly 
considered for intermittent repair projects. Panels are typically single-lane width and panel length 
may range from approximately 1.8 to 4.6m, and longer panels can be up to 6.1m. 
Continuous jointed applications—A typical joint spacing that is used in the United States for 
CIP-JCP is 4.6 m and has signifcantly reduced the risk of early-age cracking for CIP-JCP. For 
panels with thicknesses of 200–330 mm, a joint spacing of 4.6 m is recommended for jointed PCP. 
However, a longer joint spacing up to 6.1m or more may be used for individually prestressed panels 
that are 250–330 mm thick. Panel lengths as high as 10.8 m have been used in California on recent 
projects (Tayabji et al. 2013). 
18.5.1 LOAD TRANSFER PROVISIONS 
Load transfer provisions for jointed PCP systems are similar to the provisions for dowel bar retro￾ftting. The process involves the use of dowel bar slots on either one or both sides of a joint. The 
dowel bar slots may be located at the panel surface or the panel bottom. The surface slots typically 
incorporate the narrow mouth at the surface and may be fully open at the surface or open along a 
partial length of the slot. The technique and features associated with dowel bar slots that are com￾monly used in the United States are presented here. 
1. Dowel bar slots located in the panel bottom: the Fort Miller Company Super-Slab sys￾tem incorporates dowel bar slots at the bottom of the slab, as shown in Figure 18.4. 
Flowable grout is needed to fll the vertical gap (about 13 mm) along the four sides of 
the panel. 
2. Narrow-mouth dowel bar slots located in the panel surface as shown in Figure 18.7. This 
concept was developed as part of the Strategic Highway Research Program 2 (SHRP2) 
Project R05, Precast Concrete Pavement Technology. The slots are narrow and measure 
approximately 25 mm wide at the surface of the panel and tapering out to about 75 mm 
in width about an inch below panel mid-depth. The slots are approximately 180–450 mm 
long to accommodate a 180 to 450 mm dowel bar within the slot. For repair applications, 
dowel bars are inserted into the slot just before the slab is placed on the base/bedding. 
During the same or the next lane closure, the dowel bars are then slid into predrilled 
holes in the existing pavement after the holes are partially flled with epoxy. For con￾tinuous applications, the dowels are slid into companion dowel bar slots in the adjacent 
precast panel. The dowel bar slots are then patched or grouted using the dowel bar retro￾ftting technique. 
The narrow-mouth application options include the following: 
Full dowel bar retroft—Narrow dowel bar slots along both sides of the joint for continuous 
applications. 
Partial dowel bar retroft—Dowel bar slot along one side of the joint. For repair applications, 
narrow-mouth surface slots are located in the panel side of the joint. For continuous applications, a 
panel will have embedded dowel bars along one side of the panel and the matching surface dowel 
slots (with the narrow mouth) along the other side of the panel. Figure 18.4 shows a version of the 
narrow-mouth surface slot system (Ref-SHRP2-R05). 
Rapid Roadway System’s Barra Glide load transfer feature—In this proprietary system, the, 
dowel bars are preplaced in narrow-mouth slots that are partially open at the surface, as shown in 
Figure 18.8. After the panel is installed, the dowel bar is inserted into a circular or oblong hole in

the adjacent panel or existing slab. The dowel bar slots are then patched using a fast-setting, high￾strength cementitious grout using the dowel bar retroftting technique. 
Caltrans Generic Teardrop Surface Slot Feature—This feature is similar to the SHRP2 system, 
except for the slot shape, as shown in Figure 18.9. This feature requires dowel bars to be embedded 
in the adjacent (next placed) panel. The embedded dowel bars are slid into the teardrop slots of the 
previously placed panel, as shown in Figure 18.10. The slots are then patched using the dowel bar 
retroft technique as shown in Figure 18.3 (Ref-SHRP2-R05). 
Kwik Slab System—The Kwik Slab system includes a patented Kwik joint steel coupler, inter￾locks reinforced precast concrete panels, allowing reinforcement continuity throughout the length 
of the connected section as shown in Figure 18.11. The system is basically similar to JRCP sections 
which will limit the total length of the connected panels, as well as a need to provide expansion 
joints between connected sections. Use of active or expansion joints has not yet been incorporated 
into the Kwik Slab system.

18.5.1.1 Design of Load Transfer System 
The dowel bar design is dependent on the axle load location for both repair and continuous PCP 
applications. A precast panel measuring 3.65 m would require consideration of approximately a 13 
kN load transferred by the critical corner dowel bar, and a widened panel would require consider￾ation of only about a 5.3 kN load transferred by the critical dowel bar. Therefore, it is very important 
that the dowel bar spacing is considered in the critical axle loading condition. As a rule of thumb, 
dowel bars should not be placed more than 0.3 m from the outside corner location for a 3.7 m lane 
(Tayabji et al. 2013). 
To ensure the long-term effectiveness of load transfer systems, several dowel bar features 
are critical which include dowel diameter, dowel length, dowel spacing, and dowel coating. 
Recommendations for overall dowel design are presented in SHRP2-R05 program and summarized 
in Table 18.4. 
18.5.1.2 Dowel Bar Slot Patching Material 
Typically dowel bar slots are patched right after the panel installation or during the next night’s 
lane closure. The patching material must develop adequate strength rapidly. Typical strength 
requirements are 13.7–20.7 MPa within 4 h or by the time of opening the PCP section to traffc. 
These patching materials are typically rapid-setting proprietary materials and may be free-fowing 
cementitious or polymer-based and must have adequate bonding and durability to ensure adequate 
dowel-bearing strength (SHRP2-R05). 
ISTUDY572 Pavement Engineering 
TABLE 18.4 
Recommendations for Dowel Design (Ref SHRP2-R05) 
Dowel diameter For precast panels less than 250 mm thick, a dowel diameter of 32 mm is recommended; for 
slab thicknesses between 250 and 360 mm, a dowel diameter of 1.5 in. is recommended 
Dowel length Typical dowel length used in the United States is 450 mm; the use of 380-mm dowel bars is 
considered adequate, allowing for embedment of at least 175 mm at each side of the joint 
and allowing for a joint width of up to 13–25 mm 
Dowel spacing Dowels are typically placed at a spacing of 300 mm; however, since the middle dowels do 
not contribute greatly to the load transfer at a joint. A cluster of four dowels per wheel 
path, spaced at 300 mm, is considered adequate for both intermittent and continuous PCP 
applications as shown in Figure 18.2 
18.5.2 PCP SUPPORT SYSTEM 
For new construction, as well as for repair applications, pavement support is extremely important 
to the long-term performance of PCP systems. The proper seating of the panels on the base is a 
critical design and construction element. The support under the panels needs to be frm (strong) and 
uniform. All PCP applications require some form of interlayer of material between the base and the 
bottom of the precast panels since these two surfaces will typically not match. In most cases, the 
existing base surface will not be accurate enough to provide the necessary grade control for the new 
panels. To compensate for this, a bedding layer (interlayer) must be used to serve as grade control 
and as void fller to ensure the panels are fully or adequately supported. Some interlayer materials 
are installed prior to the installation of the panels; however, in all cases, the completion of the inter￾layer will take place after panel installation. 
The following support alternatives need to be considered for most PCP repair, rehabilitation, or 
reconstruction applications, as presented in SHRP2-R05 and summarized in Table 18.5. 
18.5.2.1 Bedding for Repair Applications 
For PCP repair applications, the bedding system must be well designed and installed to reduce any 
potential for consolidation. If consolidation of the bedding material occurs, the panel will experi￾ence a bridging effect and will be held in place only by the joint load-transfer mechanism. If this 
occurs, the potential for panel failure will be high. In addition, any repairs that would lead to poor 
drainage and a “bathtub” effect will result in pumping and other structural failures. 
For existing concrete pavements with a granular base, extreme care should be taken not to dam￾age the base during the pavement removal process. In addition, when a granular bedding material 
is used over an existing granular base, the thickness of the bedding should be limited to 6 mm to 
limit the potential of applying non-compactable granular material that could negatively affect the 
long-term pavement performance. When a granular bedding material is used, the panels should be 
undersealed using a fowable cementitious grout to fll in any voids or gaps under the panel. 
Recommendations for providing thicker non-granular bedding, up to 25mm, that may be con￾sidered for repair applications is presented in SHRP2-R05 program and summarized in Table 18.6. 
18.5.2.2 Bedding for Continuous Application 
The support requirements for jointed and posttensioned PCP systems are quite similar. A good sup￾port condition is always necessary for long-term performance. For continuous PCP applications, the 
following considerations for base support are necessary. 
For an existing base: The base can be used as is or with shallow trimming to allow the placement 
of panels having about the same thickness as the existing pavement. The base may also be trimmed

Cement treated or asphalt-treated bases are not considered viable options (due to 
required curing time) for PCP installed during typical nighttime lane closures, 
but they may be considered if the duration of the lane closure is not a concern.

• A rapid-setting fowable grout is placed in the repair area and 
is screeded to the desired elevation. The panel is then installed 
while the grout is still in a fresh or plastic state, allowing it to 
conform to the shape of the bottom of panel providing full 
support to the panel. 
• High-density polyurethane foam is injected under the panel 
after it is placed in the prepared repair area. An approximately 
25 mm layer of the polyurethane foam is used and becomes 
part of the permanent bedding for the panel. The polymer resin 
components are injected through small, drilled holes (5/8in. 
[16 mm] in diameter) directly through the concrete. The resin 
material expands inside the voids, until a controlled mold 
pressure develops that stabilizes the panel and if needed will 
lift it back to proper elevation. The polyurethane cures quickly 
within hours.

Note: Material compressive strength for both subsealing and cementitious bedding materials is typically about 3.4 MPa at the 
time of opening to traffc, and these materials should be non-erodible. 
to allow for a panel thicker than the existing pavement to be installed; and additional material can 
be used to achieve the necessary design grade (Ref-SHRP2-R05). 
For a new base: The PCP may be supported by a granular base or a rapid-setting lean 
concrete base (LCB). Granular bedding materials, approximately 6 mm thick, may be used to 
provide a uniform grade for PCP panel placement, and a damaged base must be repaired and 
regarded. 
An existing granular base that is damaged during the removal of the existing pavement or that 
is trimmed needs to be reworked, regraded, and recompacted. As described earlier, a 6 mm thick 
granular bedding material may be used to provide a uniform grade for panel placement. Placement 
of a new granular base should follow agency requirements, which includes those for compaction 
equipment, granular material moisture control, and compaction testing.

A number of PCP systems incorporate a leveling system for panel installation for continuous 
applications. This method requires the use of a rapid-setting high-strength cementitious grout mate￾rial under the panels. The grout is injected through a series of ports through the slab while the 
panels are maintained at the desired elevation using the leveling lift system. The strength of the 
grout should be a minimum of 3.5 MPa at 1h and at least 17 Mpa at 7 days. This is similar to 
the strength levels required for rapid-setting LCB. The specifcations required by Caltrans require 
the grout strength to be at least 17Mpa at 1h and 52Mpa at 7days, both at 22°C (Tayabji et al. 2013). 
Additional information on PCP systems, applications, guidelines, and usage, is provided in the 
FHWA publication FHWA-HIF-15-022 (FHWA 2015). 
18.5.3 PCP PANEL FABRICATION 
The production of precast concrete is a well-established practice. Industry practices have been 
developed to regulate the quality of precast concrete products and precast concrete production pro￾cesses. Most highway agencies also have developed requirements for the production of precast con￾crete. As a result, the fabrication of the precast panels for PCP applications is the most controllable 
process in PCP technology. 
Table 18.7 summarizes the process for PCP panel fabrication.

18.6 PERFORMANCE OF INSTALLED PRECAST CONCRETE PAVEMENTS 
Prior to the SHRP2 R05 study, there was a lack of documented data on the performance of installed 
PCP projects. This has raised many questions related to PCP feld performance and has detracted 
from wider implementation of PCP technology. However, there were two signifcant efforts to evalu￾ate PCP performance which included the accelerated pavement testing sponsored by Caltrans and 
the instrumentation of the PPCP project in Missouri sponsored by the Missouri DOT and FHWA. 
To obtain a better understanding of the performance of PCP projects, feld testing was conducted 
under Project R05 at selected PCP installations. The following testing and data were collection at 
each project to assess the structural and functional performance of the installed and in-service pre￾cast pavement systems (Tayabji et al. 2013). 
ISTUDY 
578 Pavement Engineering 
Under the R05 SHRP study, a number of highway agencies supported feld testing of the installed 
PCP projects. The feld testing program is summarized in Table 18.8. 
The following SHRP2-R05 program testing data were collected at each project to assess the 
structural and functional performance of the installed and in-service precast pavement systems as 
shown in Table 18.9. 
18.6.1 DEFLECTION TESTING OF JPRCP 
Defection testing for the JPrCP systems was conducted at the outer wheel path locations at trans￾verse joints and at the mid-slab location of the precast panel and control slabs of the existing pave￾ment, as shown in Figure 18.12. For JPrCP intermittent repair projects, a two-part procedure was 
followed. A precast panel test was conducted at locations a–e, as shown in Figure 18.12. Testing was 
also conducted at the frst existing slab panel that was not adjacent to a precast panel, using only 
locations f–h as shown in Figure 18.12. For continuous PPCP applications, testing was conducted for 
as many precast panels as possible during the traffc closure period. The sequence of testing for each 
panel was locations a, b, and c, as shown in Figure 18.12. The number of load drops and the target 
load levels used are 6K (26.7 kN), 9K (40 kN), 12K (53.4 kN), 15K (66.7 kN) with a 9K seating. 
Testing for the LTE evaluation was conducted with defection sensors located approximately 6 in.

(150 mm) from the center of the joint on each side and the load located tangential to the joint on the 
loaded side of the joint (Tayabji et al. 2013). 
The LTE was determined as follows: 
LTE (%) = (defection unloaded joint side/defection joint loaded side) × 100% 
The interior (basin) load test was conducted at an approximate mid-slab location for locations c and 
f. The test loads were the same as indicated above. Defection sensors were spaced at intervals of 
12 in. (305-mm), the load plate sensor and an additional fve sensors were used. 
For PPCP systems, testing was conducted at the outer wheel path locations at transverse expan￾sion joints of the outside lane and at mid-slab locations of the PTSections, as shown in Figure 18.13. 
The target load levels for the PPCP testing were 6K (26.7 kN), 9K (40 kN), 12K (53.4 kN), 15K 
(66.7 kN) with a 9K seating; and the number of load drops was in duplicate of two. Testing for LTE 
was performed similarly to the procedure used for the jointed precast pavements. The interior (basin) 
tests were conducted at locations c, d, and e. Defection sensors were spaced at 12in. (305mm); simi￾larly, a minimum of fve sensors in addition to the load plate sensor were used. LTE testing was con￾ducted for all expansion joints, and basin testing was conducted for all PTSections (Ref-SHRP2-R05). 
Three PCP repair projects will be highlighted in the following section.

The PCP panels were replaced in 2003. Panel details are shown in Table 18.10. The I-675, Michigan PCP 
Rehabilitation Project was tested during the daytime in April 2010. Five precast panels (remaining of 
the nine installed) and six existing pavement slab panels adjacent to the precast panels were tested. The

performance of the repairs was mixed. A few of the panels had deteriorated and were replaced, and one, 
shown in Figure 18.14, was being replaced. The remaining fve panels were still considered to be in good 
shape and performing well, as shown in Figure 18.15. The defection at the transverse joints between 
the precast panels and the existing pavement for the precast panels in service averaged about 8 mils 
(0.20mm) for a normalized 9000-lbf (40-kN) load; LTE at these joints averaged about 80%.

18.6.1.2 The I-15 in Ontario, California (Continuous Jointed 
PCP—Fort Miller Super-Slab JPrCP System) 
The I-15 in Ontario, California, is an example of a continuous jointed PCP. The outside two lanes 
of a fve-plus-lane roadway on northbound lanes were rehabilitated using PCP. The existing pave￾ment incorporated randomly skewed joints, and the PCP project details are presented in Table 18.11. 
The I-15, Ontario, California, project was tested during the daytime in June 2010. The tested 
panels were behind a traffc safety barrier and had not been subjected to traffc prior to defection 
testing. Testing was conducted along two sections. The longer section had 30 panels with the dowel 
slots grouted and the panel undersealed. The second section, with 12 panels, had only the dowel slots 
grouted. The difference in defection behavior for the interior of the panels is shown in Figure 18.16. 
The fully grouted precast panels had an average interior defection of 3 mils less than the precast 
panels with only the dowel slots grouted. Figure 18.17 shows the normalized defections for the panel 
joint testing. The fully grouted precast panels had on average of 5 mils less joint defection than the 
precast panels with only the dowel slots grouted. In addition the panels with only dowel slot grouting 
exhibited higher variation in the joint defection (Tayabji et al. 2013). 
In summary, the load transfer along the joints was well established, and all tested precast panels

this project, the defection testing indicated that the bedding grout (undersealing) signifcantly 
reduced both the interior and joint defection. The interior load test data suggest that the sand bed￾ding at the undersealed locations did not appear to affect the structural response. The interior test 
defection values measured at this project were similar to values measured at other PCP projects. 
However, the sections tested had not been traffcked at the time of testing. Subsequently, a few 
months after the PCP installation was completed, a large number of panels developed cracking 
(Tayabji et al. 2013). 
18.6.1.3 The I-57 in Missouri (PPCP Projects Based on the Texas PPCP System) 
The I-57 in Missouri PPCP project was constructed during December 2005. Pavement details are 
as follows in Table 18.12. 
The project was tested during daytime in March 2010. Based on the SHRP2 (Tayabji et al. 
2013), the condition of the project was good. The expansion joints along this project had been 
reconstructed during October 2009. The pavement condition is shown in Figure 18.18. A number of 
panels exhibited transverse or longitudinal cracking or both. The transverse cracking was generally 
located within the two driving lanes and did not continue all the way to the edges of the shoulders. 
The joint width at the time of the daytime testing was about 2 in. (51 mm), and the temperature 
during testing was about 60°F (16°C). The sealant material was in good condition. Spalling was 
observed at the intermediate transverse joints at a few locations. A spall resulting from high steel 
location and steel corrosion is shown in Figure 18.19. 
The LTE at the expansion joints averaged approximately 70%. The joint defections at the expan￾sion joints ranged from approximately 7 to 8 mils (0.178–0.203mm) for the 9000-lbf (40.0-kN) 
load level. Figure 18.20 shows the joint defections for the 9000-lbf (40.0-kN) load at the PPCP 
expansion joints, the PPCP interior keyway joints (between individual 10-ft [3-m]-long panels), 
and at transverse joints of the adjacent JPCP section. The defections at the PPCP expansion joints 
are about twice the defections at the transverse joints of the adjacent JPCP section. In addition,

the defection at an interior joint in PPCP Section 2 was very high, as shown in Figure 18.20. A 
transverse crack in one of the panels adjacent to that joint is evident. LTE at this interior joint was 
approximately 30%, compared with an LTE of about 90%–95% for the other PPCP interior joints 
tested. The defection data indicate that there may not be adequate residual prestress at the midsec￾tion location in this section. 
18.6.2 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS FROM FIELD TESTING 
Evaluation of feld observations and data from the SHRP R05 study shows that that well-designed 
and well-installed precast pavements perform well and have the potential to provide long-term ser￾vice for both intermittent and continuous applications. Service life expectations for continuous PCP 
applications would be approximately 40 years and would be similar to current expectations for 
new CIP concrete pavements. For intermittent repair applications, the proprietary systems (such as 
FMC’s Super-Slab system) and generic systems (such as the Michigan system or the Illinois Tollway 
system) both appear to have the potential to provide service life ranging from approximately 15 to 
20 or more years. 
For PPCP systems, good LTE with values of 90% or greater is essential for new construc￾tion for highways that carry higher levels of truck traffc. Wider joint opening of the expansion 
joints results in variable LTEs. However, limiting the length of the PTSections may provide 
a reduction in the expansion joint width and improve the LTE at these joints. Although some 
PPCP panels have exhibited cracking, this cracking is tightly bonded by the reinforcement used 
in each panel. However, adequate prestress must be maintained in the midsection area of the 
panels. 
Observations of spalling over the reinforcement at some sites requires the reinforcement should 
be epoxy-coated and should have at minimum of 2–2.5 in. (51–64 mm) of concrete cover to mini￾mize the potential for steel corrosion and subsequent surface spalling. In PCP projects where higher 
defections and loss of support at the expansion joints exist, this may be a result of nighttime slab 
curling over the full length of the PTSections, the use of thicker stone dust bedding and leveling 
material, or a combination of both (Tayabji et al. 2013). A more complete summary of projects can 
be found in SHRP2-R05 Report.

18.7 CONCRETE REQUIREMENTS 
Concrete requirements for PCP and CIP are quite similar for the highway agencies with gov￾erning authority. However, since PCPs are used in highly traffcked areas, with high traffc vol￾umes and where lanes closures are at a premium, concrete durability is signifcantly important. 
Usually the fabricator will optimize the aggregate size and gradation to achieve an economical 
and sustainable concrete mixture that is workable for fabrication of the panels. However, it is 
extremely important that the hardened concrete material does not fail because of materials￾related distress or poor quality construction (during fabrication). It is recommended that the 
maximum size aggregate should not be less than 0.75 in. (19 mm). This will ensure that load 
transfer by aggregate interlock is provided at panel cracking locations if any panels develop 
cracking under long-term traffc loading. Use of larger-size aggregate is desirable since this 
will reduce the cement requirements for a specifed mixture resulting in a more sustainable 
mixture and a more stable mixture with respect to volume changes and potential shrinkage. 
However, it should be noted that concrete volume changes related to early-age drying shrinkage 
are not of signifcant concern since these effects take place over a smaller panel length and typi￾cally before panel installation. A typical PCP concrete specifcation is presented in Table 18.13 
(Tayabji et al. 2013). 
Another important strength requirement for panel fabrication is the stripping-strength require￾ment. Most precasters need to strip the panels within 24 h to maintain panel production. The con￾crete strength at the time of stripping is determined by conducting a panel lifting stress analysis. 
Most precasters try to achieve concrete strength of about 2000 psi (13.8MPa) at 16–24h of age or 
at the time of form stripping. The early strength level generally results in higher ultimate strength 
of the concrete. 
Concrete shrinkage is another important concrete property that affects the long-term behavior 
of concrete pavements. For PCP applications, concrete shrinkage is not signifcant since a large 
portion of shrinkage occurs while the precast panels are in storage prior to placement. Also, there 
is little concern related to early-age moisture warping or built-in curling as the precast panels are 
cured for about a day under a controlled environment inside a precast plant. It is assumed in PCP 
system design that the precast panels will not exhibit signifcant concrete shrinkage after panel 
installation.

4. Aggregate gradation Well-graded aggregate will require less cementitious materials and therefore can be more 
economical. Requiring well graded aggregates for workability may not be necessary, 
but could be important during slipforming with low slump concrete 
5. Durability Durability of concrete is extremely important; the concrete should not be susceptible to 
materials-related distress, such as alkali-silica reactivity, sulfate attack, or D-cracking. 
Scaling resistance of the precast panel is also important and requires the panels to be 
cured under controlled conditions and not be overfnished

19 Pavement Surface 
Characteristics
19.1 OVERVIEW
Pavement surface characteristics, including surface texture, pavement surface friction, pavement￾tire noise, splash and spray during rains, and smoothness are of paramount significance for safe 
roads and highway user comfort. When properly designed and constructed, both asphalt and con￾crete pavements can provide safe, durable, and low noise surfaces. This chapter provides back￾ground information of pavement surface characteristics, measuring techniques commonly used to 
determine these surface characteristics, guidance for properly designing adequate surface char￾acteristics, and guidance for developing pavement surface characteristics management (PSCM) 
program.
19.1.1 Pavement surfaCe textures
Pavement surface textures, both micro and macro, have the most significant effect on surface fric￾tion, tire-pavement noise, and splash and spray. Depending on texture characteristics (i.e., vertical 
amplitude and wavelength), pavement surface texture can be divided into microtexture, macro￾texture, megatexture, and roughness/unevenness. Figure 19.1 shows the classification of pavement 
surface textures, based on their wavelength, and their respective pavement-tire interactions. Among

them, microtexture, macrotexture, and roughness that are closely related to other pavement surface 
characteristics are discussed in the following paragraphs. 
19.1.1.1 Microtexture 
Microtexture is defned by wavelengths of 0.0004–0.02in. (1 μm–0.5 mm) and vertical amplitudes 
less than 0.008 in. (0.2 mm). Microtexture is a function of the surface properties of the aggregate 
particles within the asphalt or concrete paving material (Henry, 2000). The relative roughness of 
the aggregate particles in asphalt mixtures contributes to microtexture in hot mix asphalt (HMA) 
pavements, while microtexture in Portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements is generally provided 
by the fne aggregates in the concrete mix. 
19.1.1.1.1 Measurement Techniques of Microtexture 
Currently, there is no system capable of measuring microtexture profles at highway speeds. Because 
of the diffculty in measuring microtexture profles, a surrogate indicator for microtexture is usually 
obtained. For this purpose, the following two portable friction measurement devices are often used: 
• The British Portable Tester (BPT) is often used to evaluate microtexture based on British 
Pendulum Number (BPN). The BPT test involves swinging a pendulum-based rubber 
slider that strikes a pavement surface. The elevation to which the pendulum swings after 
contacting with the surface provides the basis for BPN (AASHTO T 278, ASTM E 303). 
• The Dynamic Friction Tester (DFT) is an electronic system measuring the torque required 
to rotate three small, spring-loaded rubber pads in a circular path over a wet pavement sur￾face at different speeds (ASTM E 1911). The torque measurements taken at the slip speed 
of 12 mi/h (20 km/h) are highly correlated with BPN value (based on the results from the 
Wallops Flight Facility (Henry, 2000). It has also been found that the variability among the 
results from the DFT is signifcantly lower than those from the BPTs. 
19.1.1.2 Macrotexture 
Macrotexture is defned by wavelengths of 0.02–2 in. (0.5–51 mm) and vertical amplitudes between 
0.004 and 0.8in. (0.1 and 20mm). In HMA pavements, adequate macrotexture stems from a proper 
HMA mix aggregate properties (shape, size, and gradation), whereas macrotexture in PCC pave￾ments is most commonly produced through small surface channels, grooves, or indentations that 
are intentionally formed (plastic concrete) or cut (hardened concrete) to allow water to escape from 
beneath a vehicle’s tires. PCC pavements constructed for traffc speeds of 50 mi/h (80 km/h) or 
greater require good macrotexture to prevent hydroplaning. 
19.1.1.2.1 Measuring Techniques of Macrotexture 
Pavement macrotexture is also important for providing adequate surface friction. For example, a 
research study in North Carolina demonstrated signifcantly fewer accidents if the mean texture 
depth (MTD) was 0.06in. (1.5mm) or greater. A number of different methods have been used to 
measure macrotexture with the most commonly used ones described as follows: 
• The traditional volumetric method (commonly referred to as the “sand-patch test,” shown 
in Figure 19.2) measures the MTD. As specifed in ASTM E 965, the volumetric method 
uses a special tool to spread a specifed volume of very small glass spheres (similar to the 
size of sand particles) on the pavement in a circular motion (ASTM D 1155). The MTD is 
computed by dividing the known volume of glass spheres by the calculated average of four 
equally spaced diameters of the circular patch. 
• High-speed laser proflers, such as the FHWA Road Surface Analyzer (ROSANv), use a 
combination of a horizontal distance measuring device, a very high-speed laser triangulation 
ISTUDYPavement Surface Characteristics 589 
 
 
 
 
FIGURE 19.2 Sand-patch test (Hanson and Prowell, 2004). 
sensor, and a portable computer to collect and store pavement surface elevations [vertical 
resolution usually 0.002 in. (0.5 mm) or better] at intervals of 0.01 in. (0.25 mm) or less. 
From these elevation measurements, the system calculates the mean profle depth (MPD), 
which is an overall measure of macrotexture. The measured MPD may be used to estimate 
the more traditional MTD measurement. 
• The Outfow Meter (OFM), which consists of a transparent vertical cylinder resting on a 
rubber annulus placed on a pavement, measures the water drainage rate through surface 
texture and interior voids. The OFM measures the time required for a known volume of 
water to pass under the seal or into the pavement, which is reported as outfow time (OFT), 
defning the macrotexture. Higher OFTs indicate smooth macrotexture and lower OFTs 
indicate rough macrotexture (ASTM E 2380). 
• The Circular Texture Meter (CTM) (ASTM E 2157) is a noncontact laser device that mea￾sures the profle of an 11.2 in. diameter circle. The measured profle is then divided into 
eight segments of 4.4 in., and the mean depth of each segment or arc of the circle is calcu￾lated as MPD. The MPD obtained from CTM is found to be highly correlated with MTD 
(Henry, 2000). 
To provide adequate surface friction, the average MTD should be 0.03 in. (0.8 mm) with a minimum 
of 0.02in. (0.5mm) for any individual test (Hibbs and Larson, 1996). A recent survey found that 
New Zealand, Quebec, and South Australia specifed MTD intervention levels in the 0.015–0.035in. 
(0.4–0.9 mm) range on higher speed roadways, while Great Britain has also reported a goal of pro￾viding an MTD of 0.06 in. (1.5 mm) on their newly constructed PCC pavements. 
19.1.1.3 The Next Generation Concrete Surface (NGCS) Texture 
The Next Generation Concrete Surface (NGCS) is the quietest and smoothest concrete pavement 
surface with manufactured surface providing downward or negative texture while providing desir￾able friction characteristics, which can be applied to both new and existing concrete pavements. The 
noise level of the NGCS is typically 99 dBA when newly constructed and has a typical range up to 
102 dBA over time (Scofeld, 2012). 
It is recommended that NGCS be manufactured with the following technology: Microtexture is 
created by grinding the surface during the frst stage of the process; and then grooves are created 
with a 12.7–15.9 mm spacing and a depth of 3.2–4.8 mm (Anderson et al., 2011; Cable and Wiegand, 
2010; Guada et al., 2013; Scofeld, 2009, 2012; Skarabis and Stockert, 2015). Aggregates with the 
polished stone value (PSV) lower than 50 can be used, and a durable macrotexture and an optimal

microtexture are both ensured with the optimal placement of the diamond grinding discs based on 
the recommended technology. 
19.1.2 PAVEMENT SURFACE FRICTION 
Pavement surface friction (or skid resistance) is the retarding force developed at the tire-pavement 
interface that resists sliding when braking forces are applied to the vehicle tires. While adequate 
surface friction generally exists on dry pavements, the presence of water reduces the direct contact 
between the pavement surface and the tire and thus the surface friction. In addition, this flm of 
water combined with the high speed of vehicle may result in hydroplaning, which leads to a loss 
of the surface friction (or traction). A number of quantitative friction indices have been developed 
since the late 1940s, when the skid number (SN) was frst introduced. The preferred term is now 
friction number (FN). 
19.1.2.1 Friction Number 
The FN or SN produced by the AASHTO T 242 or ASTM E 274 locked-wheel testing device rep￾resents the average coeffcient of friction measured across a test interval. It is computed as follows: 
FN ˜ 100° ˙ ˜ 100°˛F W/ ˝, 19.1 
where FN is the friction number at the measured speed; μ is the coeffcient of friction; F is the trac￾tive horizontal force applied to the tire, lb; and W is the vertical load applied to the tire, lb. 
The reported FN values range from 0 to 100, with 0 representing no friction and 100 repre￾senting complete friction. FN values are generally designated by the speed at which the test is 
conducted and by the type of tire used in the test. For example, FN40R = 36 indicates a friction 
number of 36, as measured at a test speed of 40 mi/h (64 km/h) and with a ribbed (R) tire. Similarly, 
FN50S = 29 indicates a friction number of 29, as measured at a test speed of 50 mi/h (81 km/h) 
and with a smooth (S) tire. 
19.1.2.1.1 Measurement Techniques of Surface Friction 
• The Locked-Wheel Friction Tester (as shown in Figure 19.3): It is the predominant 
high-speed device used on the U.S. roads. This device requires a tow vehicle and a 
locked-wheel skid trailer, equipped with either a standard ribbed tire (AASHTO M 
261, ASTM E 501) or a standard smooth tire (AASHTO M 286, ASTM E 524). Friction 
measurements are obtained by locking the test tire (ribbed or smooth) on a wetted 
pavement surface while traveling at a specifed speed [40 mi/h (64 km/h) is the stan￾dard speed given in AASHTO T 242]. The smooth tire is more sensitive to pavement 
macrotexture changes, while the ribbed tire is more sensitive to microtexture changes 
in the pavement. 
• Side-Force Meter: Another way to evaluate tire-pavement friction is to measure side fric￾tion. In this case, the test wheel is maintained in a plane at the yaw angle (usually 20°) 
to the direction of motion, and a side force perpendicular to the plane of rotation is mea￾sured. There are two devices currently available for measuring side friction. The frst— 
the Mu-Meter (ASTM E 670), was developed in the United Kingdom and is designed 
not only for use on airports, but also has been used on highways. The second device is 
the Sideway-Force Coeffcient Routine Investigation Device, which was developed in the 
United Kingdom and is used in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, New Zealand, and 
other countries. 
• Fixed Slip Device: It is equipped by a braked wheel that is operated at fxed slip (usu￾ally 10%–20%). The horizontal and vertical components of friction can be continuously 
ISTUDYPavement Surface Characteristics 591

(Courtesy of Dynatest Consulting.) 
monitored without excessive wear of tire. A low-speed friction at the slip speed V (percent 
slip divided by 100) is reported in the test. However, there is no ASTM standard currently 
available, which restricts the use of those devices. Nevertheless, they are often used on 
airports for runway friction evaluation. 
• Variable Slip Device: It performs a controlled sweep through a range of slip ratios, as 
required by ASTM E 1859. These devices are referred to as “variable slip” testers and 
are not used in the United States (except for winter maintenance) but are used in a few 
European countries (France, Norway, and Denmark) as well as Japan. One variable slip 
tester, the Norsemeter SALTAR, is being used on a winter maintenance research project 
in Minnesota and Michigan with the objective of optimizing the amount of salt used by 
continuously monitoring the friction during salt application. 
19.1.2.2 International Friction Index 
International friction index (IFI) is a composite pavement surface friction index that incorporates 
simultaneous measurements of surface friction and macrotexture. The IFI is dependent on two 
parameters that describe the pavement surface friction: a speed constant (Sp) derived from the mac￾rotexture measurement that indicates the speed dependence of the friction, and a FN (F60) that is a 
harmonized level of friction for a speed of 36 mi/h (60 km/h). The IFI can be estimated (in metric 
form, as outlined in ASTM E 1960) by following the steps below: 
1. Measure pavement friction and macrotexture—using a selected friction measuring device, 
measure pavement friction FR(S) at a given slip speed S (in km/h). Also, using a selected 
texture measuring device, measure pavement macrotexture and compute MPD (ASTM E 
1845) or MTD (ASTM E 965) (in mm). 
2. Estimate the IFI speed number SP—using the computed MPD or MTD, calculate SP (in 
km/h) as follows:

3. Convert friction measurement FR(S) at slip speed S to friction at 60 km/h—adjust the 
friction FR(S) measured by the selected friction device at slip speed S using the following 
equation: 
ˆ S˙60 

where FR(60) is the adjusted value of friction measurement FR(S) at a slip speed of S to a slip speed 
of 60 km/h; FR(S) is the friction value at selected slip speed S; and S is the selected slip speed, 
km/h. 
4. Calculate the IFI friction number F(60)—using the speed-adjusted friction value FR(60) 
and the following equation, compute F(60): 
F 60 ˜ ° ˛ ˝ A B F˙ R˜ ° 60 ˝ ˙ C TX, 19.5
where A, B, and C are the calibration constants for the selected friction measuring device. The 
values of A, B, and C for various devices are given in ASTM E 1960. TX is the value of MPD or 
MTD, as determined in Step 1. 
19.1.3 PAVEMENT SURFACE-TIRE NOISE 
Tire-pavement noise becomes increasingly important for highway agencies during pavement plan￾ning and design. Although many sound sources contribute to the overall noise level in the highway 
environment, the noise produced from tire-pavement interaction is generally the largest individual 
source at vehicle speeds of more than 20 mph [mile per hour (32 kph)] for cars and more than 30 
mph (48 kph) for trucks. Many factors are involved in tire-pavement interaction and the resulting 
generation of sound, including tire design, size, condition and loading, vehicle speed, and pavement 
texture.

The on-board sound intensity (OBSI) method measures pavement-tire noise by directly installing a 
sound intensity probe on a test vehicle using an appropriate fxture. Sound intensity levels are mea￾sured at the leading and trailing edge contact patch of a test tire over a 440-ft section of pavement 
at a test speed of 60 mph. The results from the leading and trailing edge positions for each run are 
averaged together and then the tire averages for individual runs are averaged, resulting in the overall 
A-weighted OBSI level and one-third octave band levels that are reported for each pavement section 
(AASHTO TP 76). 
19.1.4 RIDE QUALITY 
Ride quality is a function of the road megatexture (i.e., surface texture with wavelengths from 2 
to 20in. [50–500 mm] and vertical amplitudes ranging from 0.004 to 2in. [0.1–50mm]), the road 
roughness (i.e., surface texture with wavelength longer than 20 in. [500 mm]), and dynamic charac￾teristics of the vehicle’s suspension. Smooth roads provide driver comfort, minimize wear and tear 
on vehicle components, increase driver safety, and increase overall pavement life and performance 
by reducing dynamic loads. Therefore, one must address the smoothness criteria for pavements not 
only from the ride point of view by using ride indices such as International Roughness Index (IRI) 
or the Present Serviceability Index, but also from the induced dynamic load point of view by using 
an appropriate pavement damage index. 
ISTUDYPavement Surface Characteristics 593 
 
The IRI is used to defne a characteristic of the longitudinal profle of a traveled wheel track 
and commonly used as a pavement roughness statistic. The IRI is computed as a fltered ratio of a 
standard vehicle’s accumulated suspension motion divided by the distance traveled by the vehicle 
during the measurement. The commonly used units for the IRI include meters per kilometer (m/km) 
or millimeters per meter (mm/m). 
There are fve steps in the determination of IRI. 
1. IRI is computed from a single longitudinal profle. The sample interval should be no larger 
than 300 mm for accurate calculations. The required resolution depends on the roughness 
level, with fner resolution being needed for smooth roads. A resolution of 0.5 mm is suit￾able for all conditions. 
2. The profle is assumed to have a constant slope between sampled elevations. 
3. The profle is smoothed with a moving average whose base length is 250mm. 
4. The smoothed profle is fltered using a quarter-car simulation with specifc values (Golden 
Car) at a simulated speed of 80 km/h (49.7 mi/h). 
5. The simulated suspension motion is linearly accumulated and divided by the length of the 
profle to yield IRI. Thus, IRI has units of slope, such as in/mi or m/km. 
Some commonly used devices to obtain a pavement profle are outlined as follows: 
Dipstick Profler: It consists of an inclinometer enclosed in a case supported by two legs sepa￾rated by 12 in. (305 mm) (as shown in Figure 19.4). Two digital displays show the elevation 
difference between the profler’s two separated legs. During measurement, the operator 
simply “walks” the profler along a premarked pavement section by alternatively pivot￾ing the instrument about each leg. The dipstick profler is good for collecting a relatively 
small quantity of pavement profle measurements. 
FIGURE 19.4 Dipstick.

ISTUDY594 Pavement Engineering 
Proflographs: It consist of a mounted sensing wheel to provide free vertical movement at 
the center of the frame (as shown in Figure 19.5). A pavement profle is derived from the 
recorded deviation against a reference plane established from the proflograph frame. 
Response Type Road Roughness Meters (RTRRMs): RTRRMs measure the vertical move￾ments of the rear axle of an automobile or the axle of a trailer relative to the vehicle frame. 
The meters are installed in vehicles with a displacement transducer on the body located 
between the middle of the axle and the body of a passenger car or trailer. The transducer 
detects small increments of axle movement relative to the vehicle body. 
Inertial reference systems: The profling device measures and computes longitudinal profle 
through the creation of an inertial reference by using accelerometers placed on the body of the 
measuring vehicle to measure the vehicle body motion. The relative displacement between the 
accelerometer and the pavement profle is measured with either a “contact” or a “noncontact” 
sensor system. Systems used nowadays are often installed in vans that contain microcomputers 
and other data handling and processing instrumentation (Figure 19.6). The noncontact systems 
use probes, either acoustic or light, to measure differences in the pavement surface.

19.2 PAVEMENT SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS DESIGN 
The objective of pavement surface characteristics design is to achieve desired pavement surfaces 
with adequate surface friction and low noise level through properly designed microtexture and 
macrotexture. To this end, the design process will focus on selection and use of (a) aggregates for 
achieving microtexture, and (b) paving mixtures and surface texturing techniques for achieving 
macrotexture. 
19.2.1 AGGREGATE TESTING AND CHARACTERIZATION 
Aggregates are the predominant components of both asphalt and concrete mixtures, which also 
directly interact with the vehicle tires and affect pavement friction as well as pavement-tire noise. 
Consequently, properties of aggregates dominate frictional performance and other surface charac￾teristics of asphalt and concrete pavements. Below is a brief discussion of aggregate properties that 
have a signifcant impact on pavement surface friction and a description of testing procedures to 
quantify these properties. 
19.2.1.1 Aggregate Composition/Structure and Mineral Hardness 
Aggregates that exhibit the highest levels of polish resistance and resistance to wear are typically 
composed of hard, strongly bonded, interlocking mineral crystals (coarse grains) embedded in a 
matrix of softer minerals. The differences in grain size and hardness provide a constantly renewed 
abrasive surface because of differential wear rates and the breaking off of the harder grains from 
the softer matrix of softer minerals. The Mohs scratch hardness test is recommended for determin￾ing mineral hardness while the information of mineral composition and structure can be obtained 
through petrographic analysis (ASTM C 295). 
19.2.1.2 Aggregate Angularity, Shape, and Texture 
Fine aggregates that exhibit angular edges and cubical or irregular shapes generally provide higher 
levels of microtexture, whereas those with rounded edges or elongated shapes generally produce 
lower microtexture. For coarse aggregates, sharp and angular particles interlock and produce a deep 
macrotexture as compared with more rounded, smooth particles. Moreover, in asphalt mixes, platy 
(i.e., fat and elongated) aggregate particles tend to orient themselves horizontally, resulting in lower 
macrotexture depth. The uncompacted voids (UV) test (AASHTO T 304, ASTM D 1252) is the 
most commonly used test for assessing fne aggregate angularity, sphericity, and texture. The frac￾tured face particles test (ASTM D 5821, AASHTO TP 61) is commonly used for assessing coarse 
aggregates, and the UV test (AASHTO T 326) is also used for evaluating coarse aggregates, which 
is similar to the UV test for fne counterpart except that proportionally larger equipment is used. 
19.2.1.3 Abrasion/Wear Resistance 
Abrasion/wear resistance of aggregates is referred to the resistance against breakdown when sub￾jected to traffc shear forces or forces during handling, stockpiling, mixing, placing, and compaction. 
While the Los Angeles Abrasion is the most commonly used test for assessing coarse aggregates, 
the Micro-Deval test (AASHTO T 327, ASTM D 6928) is suggested to be a better indicator of the 
breakdown potential of coarse aggregates. The Micro-Deval test is also used for assessing abrasion/ 
wear resistance of fne aggregates by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA [CSA A23.2–23A]). 
19.2.1.4 Polish Resistance 
Polish resistance is referred to the resistance of aggregates against grinding and shearing effects of 
repeated traffc loadings. No direct tests are available for assessing polish resistance of fne aggre￾gates, but the acid insoluble residue (AIR) test (ASTM D 3042), which indicates the amount of softer 
ISTUDY 
 
 
596 Pavement Engineering 
polishing carbonate material in an aggregate, is used. For coarse aggregates, both the AIR test and 
the polished stone value test (AASHTO T 278 and T 279, ASTM D 3319) have been used with good 
success and are recommended. 
19.2.1.5 Soundness 
Soundness refers to an aggregate’s ability to resist degradation caused by climatic/environmental 
effects (i.e., wetting and drying, freezing and thawing). Sulfate soundness test (AASHTO T 104, 
ASTM C 88) has been widely used for assessing soundness of aggregates, with either sodium sulfate 
or magnesium sulfate. 
19.2.1.6 Aggregate Test Criteria 
Based on a series of previous research studies, a range of typical values of above aggregate proper￾ties that will enhance pavement surface friction and friction durability are given in Table 19.1.

19.2.2 SURFACE MIX TYPES AND TEXTURING TECHNIQUES 
Adequate surface macrotexture is essential to ensure pavement safety. Examples of such actions 
include enhancing sliding resistance via hysteresis and reducing hydroplaning potential of vehicle 
by facilitating drainage. Adequate macrotexture can be provided through an appropriate aggregate 
gradation for asphalt pavements, while a number of techniques are available in Portland Cement 
pavements to create desirable macrotexture. Several surface mix types and fnishing/texturing tech￾niques commonly used in constructing new pavements and overlays or for restoring friction on 
existing pavements are given in Table 19.2 and Table 19.3. 
19.2.3 FRICTION DESIGN CATEGORIES 
Friction design categories should at least be established according to highway design speed 
and traffic (or design loadings in terms of equivalent single axle loads) because these factors 
have large impact on microtexture and macrotexture needs. Other factors that could be used 
in establishing categories include roadway facility type (i.e., functional or highway class, 
access type), facility setting (rural, urban), climate (e.g., wet, dry), number of lanes, and truck 
percentages. 
19.2.4 PROJECT-LEVEL DESIGN GUIDELINES 
This section provides guidance on pavement surface characteristics design so that a cost-effective 
surface can be provided to satisfy the following criteria: 
• Adequate levels of microtexture over the life of the pavement, as produced by sharp, gritty 
aggregates with low polish and high wear-resistance characteristics 
• Adequate levels of macrotexture over the life of the pavement for effcient displacement of 
water on the pavement surface 
• Low levels of splash/spray, noise generation, glare, tire wear, and rolling resistance.

A fve-step procedure is outlined as follows: 
Step 1. Determining Design Friction Level 
For each new construction or restoration project, a design friction level [expressed as F(60) if 
IFI is used or as FN] must be selected to satisfy agency policy requirements. The selected 
design level must ensure that adequate amounts of microtexture and macrotexture are 
available throughout the design period. 
Step 2. Selecting Aggregates 
To select appropriate aggregates, one should comply with the aggregate testing requirements 
established by highway agencies or those discussed above. In addition, it is important to be 
mindful of the following facts: 
• Microtexture in asphalt surface mixes is provided by the coarse aggregate surface 
texture 
• Microtexture in concrete surfaces is generally provided by the fne aggregates in the 
cement mortar/paste (for concrete mixes with exposed aggregates, the surface proper￾ties of the coarse aggregate will dictate microtexture) 
• Aggregates comprised of a matrix of both hard and soft minerals will ensure friction 
durability. 
Step 3. Establishing Surface Mix Types and/or Texturing Techniques 
As described previously, desired surface texture can be achieved through properly combining 
aggregate sources and mix type/texturing techniques. The required microtexture can be 
approximated by using DFT(20) as a surrogate: 
ˇ 60˝20 
DF ˘14.2 8ˆ 9 7. ˙MPD  T˜ ° 20 F 60 ˝ 0 081. ° / . ˙e
 
˛ ˜ ˜ ° 0 732 t 19.6
While DFT(20) is used to yield adequate microtexture, MPD is employed to achieve macrotexture 
so that the design friction level can be established for a project. 
Step 4. Development of Construction Specifcations 
Although all agencies have standard specifcations for construction of pavement surfaces that 
provide guidance on requirements for aggregates, mixes, handling, placement, compac￾tion, curing, and protection of newly constructed surfaces, special provisions may still be 
needed that clarify special requirements during blending (blending two or more sources 
ISTUDY 
 
600 Pavement Engineering 
to meet the specifcation limits), quality assurance (the frequency and extent of testing 
aggregate sources), and construction issues (control of aggregate and mix quality during 
production, handling, stockpiling, mixing, placing, and fnishing). 
Step 5. Formulation of Design Strategies 
To select the preferred pavement design strategy from various feasible alternatives, the follow￾ing major factors should be taken into consideration: (a) estimates of costs, (b) estimates of 
benefts (if the beneft cost option is selected, note that beneft cost analysis is required only 
if there is a signifcant difference in benefts between alternatives), and (c) nonmonetary 
factors. Specifc details of these major factors can be found from the AASHTO (2008) 
Guide of Pavement Friction. 
19.3 PAVEMENT SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS MANAGEMENT 
To ensure proper and timely responses to potentially unsafe pavement surfaces, a PSCM program 
should be developed through the following essential steps: 
• Collection and processing of friction and/or crash data 
• Identifcation and prioritization of sites for investigation and/or restoration 
• Performance of detailed site investigation. 
Described below is a procedure to establish a PSCM program. 
Step 1. Defning the Pavement Network 
Pavement Section Defnition: Involves identifying friction demand, which is defned as the 
level of friction (microtexture and macrotexture) needed to safely perform braking, steer￾ing, and acceleration maneuvers. Factors that affect friction demand include pavement 
alignment (both horizontal and vertical alignment), highway features/environment (i.e., 
traffc fow, the presence of controlled intersections, the presence of specially designated 
lanes, the presence and type of median barriers, and the setting [urban versus rural] of the 
roadway facility), and highway traffc characteristics (traffc volume, traffc composition, 
and traffc speed). Subsequently, different friction demand categories can be established 
for individual highway classes, facility types, or access types. 
Step 2. Network-Level Data Collection 
Collection of Friction Data: It should include the following components: (1) testing protocol 
and equipment, (2) testing frequency, (3) testing conditions, and (4) equipment calibration 
and maintenance. 
Collection of Crash Data: Inputs to classify and describe crashes may include: (1) the location 
(route, milepost, direction) of each crash, (2) vehicles involved along with their charac￾teristics, (3) drivers and passengers involved along with their characteristics, (4) ambient 
weather conditions at the time of the crash, and (5) injury levels and property damage as 
a result of the crash. 
Step 3. Network-Level Data Analysis 
Establishing Investigatory and Intervention Friction Threshold Levels: There exists a general 
relationship between pavement friction and crashes. The establishment of investigatory 
and intervention friction levels requires detailed analyses of microtexture and macrotex￾ture data and crash data, if available. Specifcally, the following three methods can be used 
for this purpose: Establishing Thresholds Using Historical Pavement Friction Data Only 
ISTUDYPavement Surface Characteristics 601 
(Method 1); Establishing Thresholds Using Both Historical Pavement Friction Data and 
Crash Data (Method 2); and Establishing Thresholds Using Pavement Friction Distribution 
and Crash Rate-Friction Trend (Method 3). The description of each of the above methods 
can be found in the NCHRP 1–43 report, Guide for Pavement Friction (www.nap.edu/ 
catalog/23038/guide-for-pavement-friction). 
Identifying Pavement Sections Requiring Detailed Site Investigation or Intervention: If the 
IFI is being used, a quick assessment can be made of the friction and texture measure￾ments to determine if microtexture or macrotexture, or both, are inadequate and in need 
of improvement. 
Step 4. Detailed Site Investigation 
If a pavement section is deemed at or below the investigatory or intervention level, it is neces￾sary to (a) identify other factors besides surface friction that negatively affect road safety, 
and (b) determine specifc causes of inadequate microtexture and/or macrotexture. 
A detailed site investigation: Involves at a minimum two steps, which are described as follows: 
(1) Conduct visual/video survey on such aspects as horizontal and vertical alignment, the 
layout of lanes, intersections, and traffc control devices, the presence, extent, and severity 
of pavement distresses (e.g., potholes, rutting, bleeding, and deteriorated patches), longi￾tudinal pavement smoothness, and transverse pavement profle, glare, splash and spray, 
and hydroplaning potential. (2) Evaluate microtexture and macrotexture involving test￾ing the pavement surface for microtexture and macrotexture using techniques described 
previously. 
Step 5. Selection and Prioritization of Friction Restoration Treatments 
Using the data collected from Steps 2–4, highway agencies can identify and prioritize main￾tenance or restoration treatment for a pavement site: 
• More frequent monitoring or forensic investigation 
• Friction restoration (short-term remedial [maintenance]) work or comprehensive res￾toration treatment (e.g., diamond grinding, cold milling, thin overlays, and chip seals) 
aimed directly at improving friction.

Maintenance and 20 Rehabilitation of Pavements 
Pavement Management Systems 
20.1 OVERVIEW 
Maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R) of pavements should ideally be conducted through the use 
of pavement management, which can ensure the optimum use of tax dollars through the selec￾tion and use of the most cost-effective design, construction, and rehabilitation strategy. Pavement 
management involves all activities regarding the planning, design, construction, maintenance, and 
rehabilitation of pavements. It is based on the pavement management system (PMS), which consists 
of a set of tools or methods that help pavement managers to plan for constructing and maintaining 
highway or airport pavements in a serviceable condition over a given period of time. 
Pavement information management systems (PIMS) or PMSs were mentioned in the 1986 
AASHTO Design Guide. This guide defned PMS, indicated its importance, and presented the steps 
needed to adopt and implement it. The guide also discussed the information needed, the importance 
of quantifcation of pavement performance and optimization in selecting strategies, different levels 
of PMS, and steps for improving PMS. The Pavement Management Guide, published by AASHTO 
in 2012, is the latest guide on PMS from AASHTO. 
Pavement management is often considered as part of a bigger management scheme—such as 
asset management (by the U.S. Federal Highway Administration System)—and requires the consid￾eration of a more holistic approach in the consideration, analysis, and implementation of highways. 
In the PMS, the implementation activities can be separated into three distinct parts: corrective 
maintenance, preventive maintenance, and rehabilitation. Corrective maintenance is provided in 
response to an existing problem, such as flling existing cracks; preventive maintenance is imple￾mented in anticipation of a drop in the quality of the pavement, such as providing a thin overlay to 
extend the life of the pavement by another 5years; and rehabilitation is adopted when a major struc￾tural improvement of the pavement is required, such as by recycling, placement of a new overlay, or 
total reconstruction. 
PMS is implemented in two different levels—network and project. At the network level, PMS is 
utilized to select the best strategies for design, construction, and rehabilitation of all the pavements 
within an agency and to result in the best beneft-to-cost ratio within a given analysis period. At the 
project level, PMS is used to select the best design, construction, or rehabilitation alternative for a 
specifc project within the network such that the project results in the maximum beneft-to-cost ratio 
over the given analysis period. 
20.2 STEPS IN PMS 
The information on the traffc, existing condition, environmental data, and construction history of 
the pavement network provides the basis of all subsequent activities in a PMS. Particular attention 
needs to be given to accurate but practical testing of existing pavements—the use of automated and 
nondestructive testing is gaining more and more favor. This information/data can be used to develop 
models for predicting the future condition of the pavements. This condition can be with respect to a 
conditioning index or residual life. Linked to this information is user input information on available 
M&R techniques, and their relative benefts and costs. The benefts and costs could be expressed 
ISTUDY606 Pavement Engineering 
simply in terms of extension of life or improvement in condition and money or in terms of those fac￾tors as well as others like fuel consumption of vehicles, user delays, and tire wear. The information 
collected and obtained by analysis up to this point can then be used to select the most appropriate 
M&R activity for any specifc pavement at the most appropriate time so as to make the best use of 
the available budget. This step is carried out, in increasing order of sophistication, through ranking, 
prioritization, and optimization. This involves consideration of the “consequence” of adaptation of 
several alternative strategies on the condition of the different pavements. The optimization can be 
based on different criteria, for example, either on the concept of minimizing the total cost while 
keeping all pavements at or above a minimum condition, or on maximizing the total beneft, with 
the available budget in the PMS. Finally, mathematical modeling is used to select the most optimum 
strategy. 
Therefore, the steps in PMS can be broadly divided into the following: 
1. Collect information on pavements (distress survey). 
2. Set up criteria for making decisions. 
3. Identify alternative strategies. 
4. Predict cost and performance of alternative strategies and compare them. 
5. Select and implement the most cost-effective strategy. 
20.3 DIFFERENT PMS APPROACHES 
Although the same in principle, there are different types of PMSs software, with appropriate models 
available to the user. For example, the World Bank has developed the Highway Development and 
Management System (HD-4) as a tool to evaluate pavement construction and maintenance strate￾gies using technical and economical considerations. Its successful use depends on the calibration of 
pavement performance prediction models to local conditions for each agency. 
MicroPaver, based on the work by Shahin et al. (1976–1977), is a pavement management soft￾ware that can be used for selection of cost-effective maintenance and repair (M&R) strategies for 
highways and airfeld pavements. It allows the user to prepare a network inventory with condition 
ratings, develop pavement condition deterioration models, predict the condition of a pavement at 
a specifc time and determine M&R needs, and evaluate the effect of different budget strategies. 
MicroPaver (also referred to as Paver) can be obtained from the University of Illinois at Urbana￾Champaign, Technical Assistance Center (phone: 800-895-9345; e-mail: techctr@uiuc.edu). The 
key steps in the PMS are illustrated next, with reference to the MicroPaver approach. 
A complete PMS consists of a series of steps, which starts with setting up a pavement inventory 
for the network that needs to be analyzed (e.g., all of the pavements in a city or county or in an 
airport). The network is made up of several branches, each of which consists of several pavement 
sections. Each section should have specifc information regarding its inventory, maintenance, and 
inspection information. Images of distresses could be stored and retrieved for each section. Input 
of work, traffc, and test (nondestructive and destructive) data could also be stored for each section. 
The results of a pavement inspection are then input for each “sample unit,” several of which make 
up one section. Using inbuilt tables of distresses (which are also coded with two-digit numbers for 
speedy entry) specifc to the type of the pavement being inspected, the type, severity, and quantity of 
the distresses observed during inspection could be input. Video inspection data could also be input. 
An example of a pavement survey form as used in MicroPaver is presented in Table 20.1. 
The next step is the determination of the Present Condition Index (PCI) of the entire section, 
using the inbuilt condition calculator in the software (for an example, see Table 20.2). PCI is a 
numerical indicator that rates the surface condition of the pavement and is used as a measure of the 
present condition of the pavement. It can be used as a basis for establishing maintenance and repair 
needs. The procedure for determination of PCI is explained in ASTM D 6433-03 for roads and in 
ASTM D 5340-04 for airfelds. The procedure consists of the following: conducting a survey of

distress (quantity and density); determining a “deduct value” for each distress and computing the 
total corrected damage value according to guidelines given in the standard; and then subtracting 
the total corrected damage value from 100 to obtain the PCI at any time. The PCI can range from 0 to 
100, corresponding to a condition of “failed” to “excellent,” respectively. 
MicroPaver uses a hierarchical structure with networks, branches, and sections in its inventory 
management. The results of an inspection can be input through an interface, and the online distress 
guide can be consulted to aid in the inspection and input. The distress type, quantity, and severity 
are combined to determine the PCI and then the condition of the pavement. 
The results give the condition index and values along with distress summaries (and projected 
distresses). Based on minimum condition criteria or projected deterioration rates, an inspection 
schedule report can be generated. Finally, summary charts can be used to develop a graph and com￾pare any two attributes of the pavement network. The software allows the user to query the whole 
database or for specifc sections to generate specifc reports. Geographical Information Systems 
(GIS) tools have been integrated into MicroPaver from its 5.1 version, which allows the user to link 
individual pavement sections to available GIS databases and display summaries and PCI reports in 
graphical format. 
ISTUDY 
608 Pavement Engineering 
For the purpose of building predictive models relating age with condition/performance, Paver 
identifes and groups families of pavements that are constructed in the same way and are subjected 
to similar conditions such as traffc and environment. This process is called family modeling. Each 
pavement section is assigned to a family, and the family model is used to predict the section’s future 
condition. Options of using unique knowledge about specifc pavement sections, and viewing (such 
as outliers, equations, and coeffcients of regression) and selecting the statistics (such as constraints) 
used to generate the models, are available. An existing model can be modifed or updated with new 
data. The data are used to form predictive equations/models relating age with PCI, and then view 
the condition of the entire pavement network or any specifc portion of it. The models (see an exam￾ple in Figure 20.1) can be used to view the condition of any pavement section (condition analysis) at 
any given time, as well as to view the deterioration of the condition of the pavement with age—the 
results are provided in the condition analysis report. 
Several forms of information can be viewed in this report, including the average condition of 
pavement for each year in the reporting period and a histogram for each year with sections grouped 
into several PCI groups (which range from excellent to failed). Critical PCI is defned as the PCI 
value at which the rate of PCI loss increases with time or the cost of applying localized preventive 
maintenance increases signifcantly. 
One of the methods adopted for predicting PCI over pavement age is using the following equa￾tion (Smith, 1986): 
˙ PCI ˜ 100 ° 1 . 20.1 
ˇ ˛ln˛ ˝ ˆ ° ln˛ AGE˝˝
Where, α, β and ρ are the constants for a PCI versus age curve that determines the age at which PCI 
reaches 0, shape of the curve and infection point of the curve, respectively. 
In the Markovian process (Butt, 1991; Shahin, 2006) for PMS, the probability of a pavement 
section remaining in the given condition state or deteriorating to the next state after one duty cycle 
(such as 1 year of weather and traffc) is determined, with a state vector, and a probability transition 
matrix. The main assumption in this technique is that the present state of the pavement is the sole 
determinator of the probability of transition from one state to the other. 
20.3.1 CRITERIA FOR MAKING DECISIONS 
MicroPaver provides a “work plan” tool that helps the user in planning, scheduling, budgeting, and 
analyzing alternative M&R activities for specifc sections and analysis periods. There are three

ways in which the analysis can be conducted: (1) critical PCI methods, which optimize the M&R 
activity against a specifc available budget or determine the budget needed to maintain a specifed 
condition level; (2) minimum condition, which works by rationing M&R by pavement condition; 
and (3) consequence model, which works by measuring the impact of localized M&R action over 
the frst year. 
Inbuilt in the Paver database is a list of global maintenance work types, along with application 
interval, improvement in the condition every year (delta), and cost (which can be edited as required). 
Cost of major M&R is determined by the PCI at the time the work is performed. Global M&R is 
defned as activities applied to entire pavement sections with the primary objective of slowing the 
rate of deterioration. This policy is applied to pavements above the critical PCI. The work quantity 
is counted using “multipliers” listed for specifc distress types and quantities. Paver allows the user 
to evaluate the effect of a selected budget and compare it with that for unfunded M&R on the condi￾tion of a pavement (Figure 20.2). Options are also available to overlay the section condition plot with 
family condition plots, view the difference between the predicted condition and that with the M&R 
option, and the difference in condition from year to year. 
20.4 DISTRESS SURVEY 
Distress surveys involve the measurement and evaluation of type, extent, and intensity of various 
types of distresses—surface defects, rutting or distortion, cracking, and patching. Such surveys 
can be conducted by an individual walking along a section of the pavement or by using multiple 
cameras from a moving specialized vehicle. An example of a vehicle used for such surveys is shown 
in Figure 20.3. The vehicle is equipped with sensors and video cameras for continuous record￾ing of different types of distresses such as cracks, which can be analyzed by pavement managers. 
Guidelines for identifying and quantifying different types of distresses are provided in ASTM D 
6433 for roads and ASTM D 5340 for airfelds. 
Structural evaluation of pavements can be done in a number of different ways. In general, the 
defection or the curvature of a pavement when subjected to a specifc load is used for such mea￾surement. Such evaluation can be frst done with large spacing, followed by testing at closer loca￾tions to quantify the structural capacity, taking into consideration the variability of the results. The 
falling weight defectometer can be used according to ASTM D 4694; the equipment is shown in 
Figure 20.4. The basic principle is the use of impulse load to measure the resulting defection in the 
ISTUDY 
610 Pavement Engineering 
FIGURE 20.3 Automatic road analyzer. 
FIGURE 20.4 Falling weight defectometer. 
pavement—the higher the defection for a specifc load, the worse the structural condition of the 
pavement. 
Skid resistance of pavements is measured as an evaluation of pavement safety. Skid resistance is 
usually measured in terms of friction factor, f, defned as F =F/L, where F is frictional resistance to 
motion in the plane of the interface, and L is the load acting perpendicular to the interface. Since the 
friction factor is dependent on many parameters such as tire type, speed, temperature, and water flm 
on pavement thickness, standards are followed to measure it. Measurements can be done according to 
ASTM E 274 (using a full scale tire). In this test, a locked tire is towed by a vehicle on a wet pavement 
(water is sprayed in front of the tire), and friction force between the tire and the pavement surface and 
ISTUDYMaintenance and Rehabilitation of Pavements 611 
FIGURE 20.5 Skid tester. 
(Courtesy of David Morrow, Dynatest Consulting Inc., Ventura, CA.) 
the speed of the vehicle are recorded (Figure 20.5). The testing results in the determination of a skid 
number (SN), which is calculated as follows: 
F SN = *100
W 20.2 
where 
F is the tractive horizontal force applied to the test tire at the tire-pavement contact patch, lbf 
W is the dynamic vertical load on the test wheel, lbf 
Note that the type of tire used in the test (ribbed or smooth) must be noted in the results by following the 
appropriate designation in the standard. In general, instrumentation in modern equipment automatically 
and continuously measures the SN for a specifc test time period and averages it for reporting. 
For pavements such as those in airports, under icy conditions, or in winter, spot measurement 
of frictional properties can also be conducted with the use of a skid tester, according to ASTM E 
2101. This is important to detect otherwise hidden effects of contaminants on the pavement surface 
that can lead to unsafe conditions. In this test (valid only for icy conditions where the depth of loose 
snow does not exceed 1 in.), the steps consist of accelerating a vehicle over the pavement and apply￾ing brakes to lock all the wheels and measuring the deceleration (which is related to the friction 
between the tire and the pavement surface) of the vehicle during braking. 
For airports, the International Runway Friction Index (IRFI) is reported as a harmonized value 
of the friction characteristics of the pavement (ASTM E 2100). The parameter is calculated from 
friction numbers determined by local friction devices through established correlations and can be 
used to monitor winter frictional characteristics of runways for maintenance. 
Surface roughness can be measured using different types of proflometers, such as through a 
multiwheel > 23-ft-long proflometer (ASTM E 1274). The test consists of moving the proflom￾eter over the pavement at less than 3 mph and determining the roughness and rate of roughness of 
the pavement as the height of each continuous “scallop” or excursion of the surface records above 
and below the base reference level. Roughness can also be measured by vehicular response to 
pavement roughness (ASTM E 1082). In this type of device, the response of a spring mass system 
supported by a vehicle suspension system in response to pavement roughness is measured using 
sensors. 
ISTUDY612 Pavement Engineering 
The following steps are suggested by Shahin (2006), for the calculation of PCI of different types 
of roads. (Readers are advised to see Shahin’s (2006) Chapter 3: Pavement Condition Survey and 
Rating Procedure for the appropriate fgures and detailed procedures.) 
1. Sample units for unsurfaced and asphalt surfaced roads: 2500 ± 1000 square feet 
Asphalt surfaced airfeld: 5000 ± 2000 square feet 
Concrete roads and airfeld with joints ≤ 25 feet spacing: 20 ± 8 slabs 
Concrete roads and airfelds with joints > than 25 feet, use imaginary joints ≤ 25 feet and 
in perfect condition should be assumed 
Example, if joints are 60 feet apart imaginary joints assumed at 20 feet; count each slab as 3 
slabs for pavement inspection 
2. Not all sample size needs to be the same, but they all have to ft the guidelines for recom￾mended sample size to ensure accurate PCI

B. Select the starting section randomly between unit 1 and i; for example, if i = 3, the ran￾dom starts (s) in between 1 and 3 
C. Sample units to be surveyed are s, s + i, s+2i; for example if i =3, selected random start, 
s =3, then the units to surveyed are 3, 3+3 =6, 3+2*3 = 9 
5. Network level inspection 
A. Number of samples to be inspected (n) 
Increase number n by 1 for every increase of 5 units in the section until N = 15 
For N = 16–40, n = 4, for n > 40, n = 10% of N, rounded off to the next whole sample unit 
B. Select samples to inspect: selected sample units should be representative (not random) of 
the overall condition of the section; the objective is to get a meaningful rating with least cost

A. Higher standards than roads 
B. Inspect 50% or even every sample unit in the center, 50 to 75 feet of runways, (keel section)

C. On taxiways and aprons, inspect 25 to 33%

20.5 MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION OF ASPHALT PAVEMENTS 
The choice between maintenance and rehabilitation is generally made on the basis of the existing 
surface and structural condition of the pavement. For example, if the surface condition is above 
a certain level, maintenance can be selected, whereas if it is below that level, both maintenance 
and rehabilitation can be considered. For the latter case, depending on the structural condition of 
the pavement, either a signifcant maintenance activity (such as a thin overlay) or rehabilitation 
(reconstruction) can be selected. Table 20.3 shows a general guideline for the selection of different 
techniques. 
20.5.1 MAINTENANCE 
Proper maintenance of pavements is vital for the safety and comfort of the traveling public, and 
the overall economy of a nation. Furthermore, appropriate maintenance work results may result in

ISTUDY616 Pavement Engineering 
signifcant enhancement of pavement life and/or lowering of rehabilitation cost in the future. The 
importance of proper maintenance has been recognized worldwide, and steps are being taken to 
develop better techniques for selecting appropriate techniques and new techniques. For example, 
in the United States since 1997, the FHWA, along with the Foundation of Pavement Preservation 
(FPP) and AASHTO, have vigorously started the adoption of good practices of pavement main￾tenance under the common theme of “pavement preservation” (www.fhwa.dot.gov/preservation, 
FHWA, n.d.; www.fp2.org, FPP, n.d.). A wealth of information can be accessed from the reference 
library section of the National Center for Pavement Preservation (NCPP, n.d.) at www.pavement￾preservation.org/reference/. Some of the more important corrective and preventive maintenance 
activities are discussed later. 
20.5.1.1 Primary Corrective Maintenance Activities 
Crack sealing is the placement of specialized materials into working cracks (horizontal movement 
> 2 mm) to reduce the intrusion of incompressible materials and prevent intrusion of water into the 
underlying pavement. The sealant material must be an agency-approved product, selected on the 
basis of temperature and traffc, and applied properly (e.g., with a backer-rod) on a clean and dry 
surface. The preparation equipment (such as a melter for hot applied sealant materials) must be 
in good working condition, and the operation must be completed in dry weather conditions with 
minimum temperature (typically 4°C and rising). Crack flling is the placement of materials into 
nonworking cracks (horizontal movement < 2 mm) to substantially reduce infltration of water and 
reinforce adjacent pavement. 
For pothole repairs, pothole patches must be made with good-quality HMA or cold mix, using 
a fne mix with adequate binder for workability, compaction, and durability after cleaning, drying, 
and applying a tack coat in the existing potholes. The patching material could be of locally avail￾able cold mix, mix produced according to specifcations, or a propriety cold mix. The compatibility 
between aggregate and asphalt binder must be ensured for mixes. In the conventional method, a 
pothole is patched by placing the materials and compacting, say, with truck tires to keep at least a 
3–6mm crown on the pothole. Prior to placing the materials, the water and loose debris from the 
pothole must be removed. Cutting the pothole sides to nearly vertical surfaces, applying tack coat 
on the sides, and utilizing a small roller or plates for compaction would result in a better patching. A 
large variety of spray injection techniques are now becoming available for pothole patching. 
20.5.1.2 Primary Preventive Maintenance Activities 
Slurry seal: A slurry seal consists of a mixture of well-graded fne aggregates and mineral fller 
with dilute asphalt emulsion, often with additives or modifers such as hydrated lime. The mix is 
generally produced by a slurry machine at the site and applied to the pavement with a squeegee. 
Slurry seal is effective in sealing minor cracks, reducing the potential of raveling, preventing further 
oxidation of the asphalt of the surface layer, and improving the friction properties of the pavement. 
Slurry seals with specifc gradations are applied for specifc pavements with different types of traf￾fc (low, moderate, and heavy). The process requires a curing period of 2–6 h, is not effective in 
pavements with heavy cracking, and should be used with caution in areas with superelevation where 
the equipment may not have good control over the fow of the slurry. Compaction by a light rubber￾tired roller may be needed. 
Chip seal: A chip seal consists of an application of asphalt binder or rapid-setting emulsion 
followed with an application of aggregate layer (Figure 20.6). If multiple layers are used (such as 
double or triple seal coats), fner gradations are used in each successive layer. Precoated aggregates 
could also be used, and one-size aggregates are often used. Compaction of the aggregate layer is 
required by a steel-wheeled or rubber-tired (preferred) roller. The minimum pavement temperature 
for the use of a chip seal is 15°C. Chip seals can be used as only wearing layers in pavements with 
light traffc. If aggregates are not properly embedded, windshield damage can result. A rubberized 
ISTUDYMaintenance and Rehabilitation of Pavements 617 
FIGURE 20.6 Chip seal. 
(Courtesy of Maureen Kestler, USDA Forest Services, Washington, DC.) 
chip seal contains ground tire rubber in addition to the usual components of a chip seal. Better 
resistance against climate and traffc-induced stress is obtained in this seal, as well as resistance 
against refective and minor fatigue cracks. It is referred to as a stress-absorbing membrane (SAM) 
or stress-absorbing membrane interlayer (SAMI) when used underneath an HMA overlay. 
Sandwich seal: This is the application of a chip seal using two layers of aggregate with one 
application of asphalt in between. Enhanced frictional properties can be obtained with this method. 
Cape seal: A cape seal (originally from Cape Province of South Africa) consists of a chip seal 
covered with a slurry seal. It prevents the occurrence of loose stones in chip seals and could be used 
in pavements with high traffc volumes. It does require a curing period of 2–6 h. 
Fog seal: A fog seal consists of the application of a diluted asphalt emulsion (slow or medium 
setting) without the application of any aggregate. It is used for preventing raveling and for sealing 
surfaces to resist oxidation of the surface layer. The temperature should be above 16°C for applica￾tion, and the layer needs some curing time before opening to traffc. The pavement should be porous 
enough to absorb some of the asphalt emulsion, and until some of the emulsion of the surface is 
worn away by traffc, friction may be reduced. A better friction can be obtained by the use of sand 
seal, in which the sand is applied over a rapid or medium setting emulsion layer. 
Microsurfacing: Microsurfacing consists of the application of a mixture of high-quality aggre￾gates and polymer-modifed emulsion binder with additives. The components are mixed in a travel￾ing pugmill, and areas with traffc do not require any compaction. Microsurfacing is used to seal the 
pavement and prevent raveling. It can also be used to resist oxidation of the surface layer, improve 
friction, and fll in minor ruts. This process uses relatively fast-setting emulsions and requires mix 
design for determination of the asphalt content, and specialized paver for laydown. The paver has a 
continuous-fow metering and mixing unit with a multi-blade, double shafted mixer. Type II micro￾surfacing consists of commonly used aggregate sizes, whereas the Type III uses larger aggregates 
to provide higher levels of skid resistance Mix design is conducted according to ISSA A 143/ASTM 
D 6372 specifcations. Tests for aggregates consists of Sand Equivalency, Soundness, LA Abrasion, 
gradation, and bulking effect (AASHTO T 19M/T 19 Standard Method of Test for Bulk Density 
[“Unit Weight”] and Voids in Aggregate). The asphalt emulsion is tested for settlement and stor￾age stability (AASHTO T 59), distillation (AASHTO T 59), softening point (AASHTO T 53), and 
penetration (AASHTO T 49). The mix tests include mix time (ISSA TB 113), wet cohesion (ISSA 
TB 139), wet stripping (ISSA TB 114), wet track abrasion loss (ISSA TB 100), lateral displace￾ment (ISSA TB 147), excess asphalt by loaded wheel test and sand adhesion (ISSA TB 109), and 
classifcation compatibility (ISSA TB 144). Prior to the placement of a microsurfacing layer, the 
existing pavement surface distresses must be addressed with patching and crack flling, and the 
thermoplastic pavement markings must be removed. The quick-set properties of the mix must be 
ISTUDY618 Pavement Engineering 
taken into consideration during mix design to allow for adequate workability during placement. 
Microsurfacing is recommended only when the pavement and air temperatures are > 7°C and ris￾ing, and no impending rain in forecast. Construction quality control measures require checking of 
the surface prior to placement, ambient temperature and the gradation of the aggregate, checking of 
application rate, and sampling and testing of the mix that is discharged from the paver for asphalt 
content (PPRA, 2020). 
Thin HMA overlay: Thin asphalt overlay: A thin (< 1.5 inch) or an ultra-thin (< 1 inch) HMA 
overlay is generally used for pavement preservation—rectifying pavements with minor cracking, 
raveling, and rutting or to restore smoothness. They can also be used to improve wet weather skid 
resistance and reduce tire-pavement noise. Such a layer should be placed on a structurally sound 
pavement structure, and existing potholes, excess crack sealants, and fatigue cracking should be 
patched before the placement of thin overlay. Milling prior to the placement of the think overlay 
can improve ride quality and drainage and remove existing distresses. This type of layer should be 
placed on a pavement whose performance is still good, but close to fair (assuming that the pavement 
has three distinct phases of performances—good, fair, and poor). Although a thin asphalt overlay 
specifcally refers to dense graded mix with nominal maximum aggregate size (NMAS) of 4.75 or 
9.5 mm (ThinlayTM, term used by NAPA), the concept has been utilized with other mixes such as 
open graded and stone matrix asphalt (SMA). Some agencies use polymer modifed binder for thin 
overlays (for example, New Jersey Department of Transportation used 4.75 mm NMAS mix with 
PG 76-22 binder). Standards for the design of 9.5 mm and 4.75 mm NMAS mixes are provided in 
AASHTO M 323. Generally, these mixes have a higher asphalt content (due to fner gradation) and 
a higher percent passing the 75μ material (dust-to-binder ratio) than conventional lifts. The grade of 
the binder should be selected to resist rutting, and moisture susceptibility test (AASTHO T283, for 
example) should be conducted before the selection of the mix design. The lift thickness should be 
equal to or greater than three times the mix NMAS. A proper amount of tack coat (0.04 to 0.08 gal/sy) 
on a cleaned surface should be applied for proper bonding of this layer with the existing layer, and 
the layer is placed using conventional equipment. Conventional rolling equipment (generally in 
static mode) can be use, but the layer may need rolling within a short period of time as the thin layer 
cools down rapidly. Experience with thin overlays indicate that properly paced mixes can slow￾down the aging of binder and water ingress into lower layers. Performance lives of thin overlays 
have been reported to be between 5–8 years (wet-freeze climate) to 7–10 years (warm-dry climate) 
(FHWA, 2019). 
Ultrathin friction course: This is a procedure in which an HMA layer made with polymer-modifed 
asphalt and gap graded aggregate is placed on a heavy tack coat of polymer-modifed emulsion 
asphalt. Products such as Novachip are applied in one pass (binder, aggregates, and screeding) by a 
single specialized piece of equipment. It is used for sealing the surface and minor cracks, increasing 
friction, and reducing tire noise. 
The reader is advised to view the latest NCHRP publication on emulsion-based chip seals, avail￾able at http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_rpt_680.pdf. 
High Friction Surface treatments (HFST) can be applied to increase friction signifcantly, and 
hence improve safety in high crash potential areas, with specifc geometries, high vehicle speeds, and 
under wet conditions (FHWA, 2019). The most applicable areas of such treatment consists of areas 
with sharp horizontal curves that require excessive braking, high volume intersection approaches, 
interchange ramps and bridges, and any pavement surface where there is a potential of premature 
polishing of aggregates. The treatment consists of polish and abrasion resistant aggregates with 
polymer modifed binders. Manual or mechanized placements of this treatment can be used, and 
the treatment can be applied in small or spot stretches that are especially vulnerable to aggregate 
polishing, surface water accumulation and ice buildup, and reduce safety. The texture of the HFST 
prevents the holdup of water, and hence reduces the potential of hydroplaning. The thickness of the 
layer can be as low as −1/8 inch—1/4 inch (3–6 mm). Mechanized placement of HFST is conducted 
ISTUDYMaintenance and Rehabilitation of Pavements 619 
 
at the same speed as conventional HMA paving operations. There are many commercial types of 
HFST available in the market, both for roads with vehicular and pedestrian traffc. An example is 
TyregripTM, (Ennis-Flint, 2020) which consists of a thermosetting modifed epoxy/amine binder, 
and natural or pigmented calcinated bauxite, with a polish stone value (PSV) of 70 and aggregate 
abrasion value (AAV) of 4. The binder is applied at a typical rate of 1.8 kg/m2, at a temperature 
above 5°C. Specifcations for the binder includes tensile strength at 25°C of 1.5 N/mm2 minimum, 
and an elongation at break at 23°C of 30% minimum, after 7 days of curing at 23°C. The aggregate 
has a gradation of 5% (max) passing the 1.18 mm BS sieve and 5% (max) retained on the 3.35 mm 
BS sieve for the standard road grade application, and 5% max passing the 0.71 mm BS sieve and 5% 
max retained on the 1.70 mm BS sieve for the pedestrian grade application The average coverage 
rate of the aggregate is 7–8 kg/m2. 
Examples of specifcations of HFST from Alabama and California (Caltrans) DOT can be found 
at www.atssa.com/Portals/0/Specifcations_AlabamaDOT.pdf and www.atssa.com/Portals/0/ 
Caltrans_10-1.18_ThinHFST.pdf, respectively. The reader is also requested to explore the American 
Traffc Safety Services Association (ATSSA) website at www.atssa.com/Tech-Innovation/High￾Friction-Surface-Treatment/PgrID/592/PageID/1, and the High Friction Roads webpage at www.

20.5.2 RECYCLING 
The Asphalt Recycling and Reclaiming Association’s (ARRA) publication Asphalt Recycling 
Manual (ARRA, 2003; and see www.arra.org) is a good source of information on asphalt 
pavement recycling. The common types of recycling operations include hot mix recycling, hot 
in-place recycling (HIR), cold in-place recycling (CIR), and full-depth reclamation (FDR). 
Of these, hot mix recycling is used very commonly for producing hot mix asphalt, which 
can be used as overlays in preventive maintenance or as thick layers in rehabilitation. Hot in￾place and CIR are commonly used for preventive maintenance operations, whereas full-depth 
reclamation is generally used for rehabilitation work. The preventive maintenance applica￾tions are discussed first, followed by the rehabilitation methods. (The FHWA guidelines 
for recycling for state and local governments are available at www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/ 
recycling/98042/.) 
20.5.2.1 Hot In-Place Recycling 
Hot in-place recycling has been described as an on-site, in-place method that rehabilitates deterio￾rated asphalt pavements and thereby minimizes the use of new materials. Basically, this process 
consists of four steps: (1) softening of the asphalt pavement surface with heat; (2) scarifcation and/ 
or mechanical removal of the surface material; (3) mixing of the material with recycling agent, 
asphalt binder, or new mix; and (4) laydown and paving of the recycled mix on the pavement sur￾face. The primary purpose of hot in-place recycling is to correct surface distresses not caused by 
structural inadequacy, such as raveling, cracks, ruts and holes, and shoves and bumps. It may be 
performed as a single-pass operation or a multiple-pass operation. In a single-pass (Figure 20.7 and 
Figure 20.8) operation, the virgin materials are mixed with the restored reclaimed asphalt pavement 
(RAP) material in a single pass, whereas in the multistep process, a new wearing course is added 
after recompacting the RAP materials. 
The advantages of hot in-place recycling are that elevations and overhead clearances are pre￾served, it is comparatively economical, and it needs less traffc control than the other rehabilitation 
techniques. This process can also be used to recoat stripped aggregates, reestablish crown and 
drainage, modify aggregate gradation and asphalt content, and improve surface frictional resis￾tance. Hot in-place recycling is usually performed to a depth of 20–50 mm (3/4–2in.), with 25 mm 
(1in.) being a typical depth.

FIGURE 20.8 Hot in-place recycling. 
20.5.2.2 Cold Recycling 
Cold recycling can be divided into two main parts—CIR and central plant (cold mix) recy￾cling. CIR can further be divided into two parts—CIR (limited to the asphalt surface or/ 
surface plus binder layer) and full-depth reclamation (recycling of asphalt layer plus part of 
the granular base material). Cold milling is also used for obtaining materials for hot mix 
recycling. 
20.5.2.3 Cold Milling 
The advent of cold milling (cutting) has revolutionized the recycling of asphalt pavements. Cold 
milling has been defned as the method of automatically controlled removal of pavement to a

desired depth with specially designed equipment, and restoration of the surface to a specifed grade 
and slope, free of bumps, ruts, and other imperfections. The Asphalt Recycling and Reclaiming 
Association guideline specifcations for cold milling require that the milling machine be power 
operated, self-propelled, and self-suffcient in power, traction, and stability to remove a thickness 
of HMA surface to a specifed depth. The alternative to cold milling is ripping and crushing opera￾tions with earthmoving equipment, scarifers, grid rollers, or rippers, which are not commonly used 
today. 
The modern cold-milling equipment has tungsten carbide teeth on drums, with variable cutting 
width for a variety of pavements/lanes, and excellent maneuverability for diffcult milling situations 
like around utility inspection covers in city streets. Figure 20.9 shows a few examples of milling 
equipment. In many cases, such equipment has been integrated with a system of spraying recycling/ 
stabilizing materials, mixing, and compacting, in recycling equipment, as shown in Figure 20.10.

20.5.2.3.1 Cold In-Place Recycling 
CIR is defned as a rehabilitation technique in which the existing pavement materials are reused 
in place. The materials are mixed in-place without the application of heat. The RAP material is 
obtained by milling (cutting), planning, or crushing the existing pavement. Virgin aggregate or 
recycling agent or both are added to the RAP material, which is then laid and compacted. The use 
of CIR can restore old pavements to their desired profle, eliminate existing wheel ruts, restore the 
crown and cross slope, and eliminate potholes, irregularities, and rough areas. It can also eliminate 
transverse, refective, and longitudinal cracks. Some of the major reasons for the increased use of 
CIR are the increased scarcity of materials, particularly gravel and crushed rock; the method’s 
high production rate and potential of cost savings; minimum traffc disruption; the ability to retain 
the original profle; the reduction of environmental concerns; and a growing concern for depleting 
petroleum reserves. 
The steps in CIR consist of preparation of the construction area, milling of the existing pave￾ment, the addition of recycling agent and virgin materials, laydown, compaction, and placement of 
the surface course. Average speed of the process is about 15–30 ft/min. If overlap is necessary dur￾ing multiple passes, some of the nozzles of sprayer that is used for additive can be switched off so as 
not to have a double dose. The recycled layer surface (before it is overlaid with HMA) is generally 
fog sealed (for example, CSS1H diluted 50% by volume of water, 0.05–0.15 gal/yd2, 0.2–0.7 l/m2
) and 
ISTUDYMaintenance and Rehabilitation of Pavements 623 
covered with sand dust (sand blotter 1–2 lb/yd2, 0.5–1.0 kg/m2
) before opening to traffc. Vibratory 
drum rollers are used for compaction, with four passes in vibratory mode and one in static mode. 
For greater thickness sections, part of the existing pavement can be milled and sent as RAP to plants 
while the remaining section can be recycled. 
The addition of new aggregates may not be necessary in some projects. At present, two dif￾ferent methods are used for CIR: the single machine and the single-pass equipment. The single 
machine or single-pass equipment is capable of breaking, pulverizing, and adding recycling agents 
in a single pass (Figure 20.11). The single-pass equipment train consists of a series of equipment,

each capable of a particular operation. The usual components are a cold-milling machine, portable 
crusher, travel-plant mixer, and laydown machine. 
Sometimes cold central plant recycling is conducted to make use of existing RAP stockpiles and/ 
or make recycled mixes for later use. Sophisticated equipment is available to prepare such mixes, 
using one or more recycling additives, as shown in Figure 20.12. 
20.5.2.3.2 Full-Depth Reclamation 
Full-depth reclamation has been defned as a recycling method where all of the asphalt pavement 
section and a predetermined amount of underlying materials are treated to produce a stabilized base 
course. Different types of additives, such as asphalt emulsions, and chemical agents, such as calcium

chloride, Portland cement, fy ash, and lime, are added to obtain an improved base. The fve main 
steps in this process are pulverization, introduction of additive, shaping of the mixed material, com￾paction, and application of a surface or a wearing course. If the in-place material is not suffcient to 
provide the desired depth of the treated base, new materials may be imported and included in the 
processing. This method of recycling is normally performed to a depth of 100–300mm (4–12in.). 
The major advantages and benefts of full-depth reclamation are as follows: 
1. The structure of the pavement can be improved signifcantly without changing the geom￾etry of the pavement and shoulder reconstruction. 
2. It can restore old pavement to the desired profle, eliminate existing wheel ruts, restore 
crown and slope, and eliminate potholes, irregularities, and rough areas. Pavement￾widening operations can also be accommodated in the process. A uniform pavement struc￾ture is obtained by this process. 
3. It can eliminate alligator, transverse, longitudinal, and refection cracking. Ride quality 
can be improved. 
4. Frost susceptibility may be reduced. 
5. The production cost is low, and only a thin overlay or chip seal surfacing is required on 
most projects. 
6. Engineering costs are low. 
7. Materials and energy are conserved, and air quality problems resulting from dust, fumes, 
and smoke are eliminated. The process is environmentally desirable since the disposal 
problem is avoided. 
Full-depth reclamation has been recommended for pavements with deep rutting, load-associated 
cracks, non-load-associated thermal cracks, refection cracks, and maintenance patches such as spray, 
skin, pothole, and deep hot mix. It is particularly recommended for pavements having a base or sub￾grade problem. In this method, the frst step is to rip, scarify, or pulverize or mill the existing pavement 
to a specifed depth. The resulting material can be processed further for size reduction and mixed with 
recycling agents and new materials, if required. These include the multiple-step sequence, two-step 
sequence, single machine, and single-pass equipment train. Modern equipment is available for single￾pass FDR, with the option of using water, emulsion, foamed asphalt, or cement slurry as the recycling 
additive. Figure 20.13 shows an example of an FDR process with cement slurry. 
Foamed asphalt is being used increasingly in FDR. Foaming facilitates better dispersion of the 
asphalt into the materials to be recycled. A small amount of water is sprayed into hot asphalt as it 
is mixed with pulverized recycled pavement and soil. As the hot liquid and water mix, the liquid 
expands in a mini-explosion, creating a thin flm of asphalt with about 10 times more coating poten￾tial. In modern single-pass equipment, foamed asphalt is created within the equipment in a separate 
foaming chamber and is directly added to the pulverized road material. An example of such equip￾ment is shown in Figure 20.14. 
20.5.2.3.3 Multi Recycling/Stabilization 
In certain cases where there is a signifcant thickness of HMA over a poor quality base material that 
is causing repeated distress in the pavement, a combination of recycling work or multi recycling/ 
stabilization may be needed. An excellent example is the work conducted on rehabilitating a stretch 
of I-81 in Virginia, United States (details at http://www.virginiadot.org/vtrc/main/online_reports/ 
pdf/15-r1.pdf). This section had 10–12 in. of HMA over a base course with clay materials. First, the 
top 10 in. was milled off, leaving only about 1 in. of HMA on the base course. The milled material 
was recycled in a central cold recycling plant using foamed asphalt, while the in-place thin layer of 
HMA and the base, was subjected to full depth reclamation up to a depth of 12 in., with lime at the 
rate of 5% by mass. The foamed asphalt recycled material (2.2% foamed asphalt with 1% cement) 
was placed over the FDR reclaimed base and then overlaid with 2 lifts of HMA, each 2 in. thick.

20.5.2.4 Hot Mix Recycling
Hot mix recycling has been defined as a method by which RAP is combined with new aggregate 
and an asphalt cement or recycling agent to produce HMA. The RAP may be obtained by pavement 
milling with a rotary drum cold-milling machine or from a ripping/crushing operation.
The objective of the next step, crushing, is to reduce the RAP to the maximum acceptable particle 
size. One example of such a limit is that at least 95% of the RAP passes the 2 in. sieve. Cold-milling 
ISTUDYMaintenance and Rehabilitation of Pavements 627 
 
 
machines can crush the RAP in place, whereas in the ripping/crushing operation, front-end load￾ers are generally used to break up the pavement material so that it can be loaded into a truck for 
crushing at a central plant. The amount of aggregate degradation by cold milling is a function of the 
aggregate top size and gradation of the HMA pavement. For crushing in a central plant, different 
types of crushers are available, for example, compression crushers and impact crushers. 
A “RAP breaker” or “lump breaker” is also used between the bin and the belt for size reduction. 
Impact crushers are most widely used in recycling. To produce a homogeneous RAP product, the 
RAP material is frst blended thoroughly with a front-end loader or a bulldozer, and then crushed to 
downsize the top stone size in the RAP to one smaller than the top size in the HMA being produced 
(e.g., 16mm for a 19.5mm top-size mix). This is to ensure that the asphalt-aggregate blend is broken 
as much as possible and there is no oversize material. 
RAP from different sources and containing different asphalt content and aggregates with dif￾ferent gradations should be stockpiled separately. RAP can be stockpiled either before or after 
processing, and a front-end loader or a radial stacker can be used for the purpose. The two major 
problems associated with stockpiling are consolidation and moisture retention. In the past, it was 
believed that low, horizontal stockpiles are better than high and conical stockpiles, which can result 
in reagglomeration of RAP. However, experience has actually proven that large, conical stockpiles 
are better, and RAP does not recompact in large piles. Actually, there is a tendency to form a crust 
over the 20–25cm (8–10 in.) of pile depth. This crust can be easily broken by a front-end loader. 
Also, the crust tends to shed water and prevent the rest of the pile from recompacting. In the case of 
a low, horizontal stockpile, this 20–25 cm (8–10 in.) crust is also present. 
Modifcations are required in the batch plant to recycle RAP since attempts to introduce RAP 
directly with the virgin aggregates result in excessive smoke and material buildup problems in the 
dryer, hot elevator, and screen tower. The most widely used method for batch plant hot mix recycling 
is the “Maplewood method.” Even though variations exist, basically a separate cold feed bin intro￾duces the RAP into the weigh hopper or the pugmill by a chute and belt conveyor (Figure 20.15). 
There the RAP is joined by the virgin material coming from the cold feed bins through the dryer 
and the screen decks. The temperature to which the virgin aggregates are superheated depends on 
the properties of the RAP material. 
The RAP material cannot be processed in normal drum mix plants since excessive “blue smoke” 
is produced when the RAP comes in contact with the burner fame. The condition is further aggra￾vated by the buildup of fne aggregates and asphalt binder on metal fights and end plates. It has 
FIGURE 20.15 Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) feeder in a batch plant. 
ISTUDY628 Pavement Engineering 
been suggested that most of the smoke problem is caused by the light oils in soft grades of asphalt 
binder used to rejuvenate the aged asphalt in the RAP. Although the smoke problem could be solved 
by various processes such as lowering the HMA plant’s production rate, decreasing the moisture 
content of the RAP, lowering the discharge temperature of the recycled mix, introducing additional 
combustion air, and decreasing the percentage of RAP, it was found that a more effective way to 
rectify the problem was to modify the drum mix plant. 
Although variations exist in the process, basically the center entry method (Figure 20.16) is the 
most widely used method for hot mix recycling in a drum mix plant. In this method, the RAP is 
introduced into the drum downstream of the burner fame to mix with the superheated new aggre￾gates. The hot virgin aggregates heat up the RAP material by conduction. The RAP is protected 
from coming in direct contact with the burner fame by a dense veil of aggregate added prior to the 
point where the RAP is added. It is very important to have the veil of virgin aggregate. Otherwise, 
overheating of RAP can result in blue smoke, and it may not be possible to use the design amount of 
RAP material. Sometimes special fight design, steel ring dams, or circular steel fame shields are 
utilized to force the RAP to mix with the virgin aggregates before being subjected to the high gas 
treatment. These techniques eliminate the “blue smoke” problem. 
Since the late 1980s, two new drum designs for more effcient heat transfer to RAP material dur￾ing mixing have been developed. These are the double-barrel and triple-drum design. The double￾barrel counterfow drum mix plant has more mixing space than a conventional drum mixer. The 
shell of the drum is used as the shaft of the coater. A 3.0–3.3 m (10–11-ft) diameter coater is created 
with an extremely large, insulated mixing area. The virgin aggregate material is dried in the inner 
drum and superheated to 315°C–343°C (600°F–650°F) (when running 50% RAP). It then drops 
through the wall of the drum and meets with the RAP in the annular space. Approximately 1½ min 
of mixing time occurs in this outer shell. Since the outer shell does not rotate, easy access is avail￾able to add various other recycle components to the process as they become necessary and available. 
The heat of the inside barrel is transferred through the rotating shell to mixing in the annular space. 
The outer shell of the double barrel remains at approximately 49°C (120°F) at all times, leading to 
a very effcient plant. In this method, the virgin and the RAP material are not exposed to the hot 
gases or to the steam of the drying process, and thus the light oils are not removed from the mix. In 
the outer section of the double barrel, due to the moisture removed from the RAP, a steam or inert 
atmosphere occurs, resulting in a much lower oxidation or short-term aging of the recycled HMA 
mix in the mixing chamber. Another beneft derived from this type of plant is the much longer life 
FIGURE 20.16 RAP feeder in a drum plant. 
ISTUDYMaintenance and Rehabilitation of Pavements 629 
occurring with the bags in the baghouse due to the relatively lower temperature of the exhaust gases. 
As dust is discharged from the baghouse through a rotary airlock on the double-barrel plant, a screw 
conveyor is used to transfer the mix back into the outer shell. The holes through which the virgin 
aggregates are directed into the outer shell are also responsible for channelizing any smoke from 
the inner mixing section to the outer space. The pollutants go directly to the fame, where they are 
burned. This results in reduced emission and blue smoke. The counterfow dryer design also leads 
to higher production rates with much lower fuel consumption. The triple-drum design also uses an 
outer shell; however, a stainless steel cylinder is used to enclose the combustion chamber. This cyl￾inder (without any fight or steps of a regular drum) is believed to be effective in transferring heat 
to the RAP material through conduction and radiation. The virgin aggregate is introduced from the 
opposite end of the burner fame. The RAP material is introduced in the annular space formed by 
the outer shell. The superheated virgin aggregates fall into the annular space and mingle with the 
RAP material. The factors controlling the production limit in a drum mix plant are the moisture 
content and ambient temperature of the RAP and new aggregate. A practical limit of 30:70 (30% 
RAP and 70% new aggregate) has been recommended in the available literature, although research 
continues to enable the use of a higher percentage of RAP. 
The latest FHWA state-of-the-art report on recycling RAP is available at www.fhwa.dot.gov/ 
publications/research/infrastructure/pavements/11021/11021.pdf. 
20.5.2.4.1 Hot Mix Recycling 
While the recycling of asphalt pavement has been in use since the beginning of the twentieth century 
(frst documented Hot Mix recycled pavement was laid down on 1–15 in 1971, in Nevada, near Las 
Vegas), its practice in the United States increased dramatically during the 1970s because of the oil 
crisis and the introduction of milling machines. Since then, many pavements have been constructed 
with RAP—some as experimental DOT or Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)-sponsored 
demonstration projects and the others as part of routine operations. Simultaneously, many applied 
and theoretical research projects have been carried out (and are still continuing) to understand the 
process of recycling such that the controllable factors could be recognized, and recycling could be 
carried out with full confdence. Furthermore, research is also being carried out to extend the enve￾lope of recycling—allowing DOTs and other users to use more and more RAP in the mixes, and 
hence enjoy further savings in their budget. 
After an initial spurt in the 1970s and 1980s, recycling declined signifcantly after the introduc￾tion of Superpave, since new gradation specifcations were introduced and coarser gradations are 
encouraged, which is diffcult to meet with RAP materials, and users became concerned about the 
effect of variability of RAP on the quality of construction. In many parts of the country though, the 
successful use of RAP at relatively high percentages did continue for owners such as municipali￾ties, who did not have to comply with Superpave requirements. However, since the middle part of 
the last decade, with increases in asphalt binder costs, and dwindling aggregate resources, research 
on recycled mixes at the DOT level again picked up. These efforts included National Cooperative 
Highway Research (NCHRP) programs, FHWA-sponsored studies and demonstration projects, as 
well as DOT-sponsored projects. As DOTs started pushing for the use of more and more RAP, many 
of the assumptions that were made in the earlier research, which gave out guidelines for the use of a 
relatively lesser amount of RAP, began to be questioned. This is primarily because the feld perfor￾mance of recycled mixes has been widely varying throughout the country. While general concepts 
can be hypothesized, proved in the laboratory, and modeled on a small scale, the recycling of RAP 
in HMA is a very complex process that involves several steps, and there are multiple factors in each 
and every step that need to be addressed. As has been pointed out (Schreck, 2007), recycling is not 
simply inserting more RAP in a batch or drum plant, but it involves signifcantly more input and 
investment. There has been an ongoing debate on whether there is a complete blending of a virgin 
binder with the aged binder or not. Equally important are other questions such as, does the RAP 
binder really “melt” away from the RAP particles and mingle with the virgin binder (or recycling 
ISTUDY630 Pavement Engineering 
agent), and if it does, how much of the binder from the RAP is effectively available? There are 
answers available in the literature, but most of them may not be universally applicable. Incomplete 
blending can make the recycled mixes much stiffer (Foxlow et al., 2011), and hence with increased 
cracking potential. There is clear evidence that the percentage of RAP and the grade of the aged 
RAP binder affect the properties of the recycled mix in a signifcant way (Daniel et al., 2009, 2010; 
Mallapudi and Reddy, 2020). The results of the above diffculties have been refected in several 
cases where durability issues have become apparent—for example, raveling and cracking in RAP 
mixes. This becomes somewhat frustrating for the users, as these pavement distresses are seen in 
perhaps isolated instances but repeatedly, in spite of adherence to guidelines and specifcations that 
are available nationally or regionally. In light of these facts, the reluctance of specifying agencies to 
allow a high percentage of RAP seems to be quite justifed, especially since most road construction 
is through the spending of public funds. 
The major challenge associated with using high RAP content in HMA is the restoration of the 
desired rheological properties of aged binders in RAP (Zaumanis et al., 2014). Overcoming this 
challenge requires an enhanced understanding of rejuvenation mechanisms and the relationships 
among chemical composition, and the rheological properties of asphalt binders, and between the 
changes in the binder and the performance-related properties of the mix. An additional critical factor 
is the consideration of long-term feld aging and moisture damage potential, as both of these factors 
lead to an increased potential of durability problems. Because these factors are highly dependent 
on local materials and climatic conditions, it is essential that a mix design system that considers the 
locally available factors is available to the users. 
20.5.2.4.2 Hot Mix Recycling Mechanism 
Asphalt binder ages over time primarily due to oxidation and volatilization of the lighter frac￾tions (Vallegra et al., 1957; Finn, 1967; Petersen, 2009). As a result, chemical and microstructural 
changes occur in the binder and in the mix, which makes them brittle and prone to cracking. The 
objective of a successful recycling program is to restore the properties of the binder to the pre-aging 
level, such that it performs as a virgin binder. For relatively low amounts of RAP percentage and 
viscosity-based specifcation, one practice that has been adopted so far is the use of low viscosity 
asphalt binder (recycling agent) in connection with the aged RAP binder. This is based on the laws 
of a mixture, which states that the natural log of the viscosity of a mix is the sum of the natural log 
of each component times its concentration in the mix (Kari et al., 1979; Asphalt Institute, 1986); 
recommendations have also been made to use a similar approach with Superpave binder param￾eters (Kandhal and Foo, 1997). Successful attempts have also been made to incorporate Warm Mix 
Asphalt (WMA) technology in recycling to allow the use of higher RAP percentages (Mallick et 
al., 2008; Mogawer et al., 2009). The utility of this method is in reducing the mix temperature and 
further oxidation of the aged RAP binder. This approach has worked relatively well for mixes with 
a RAP content of as high as 20% (and 50% in the laboratory) over the years but does not appear to 
work for mixes with higher RAP percentages. 
This is because the higher percentage of RAP in a mix results in an excessively high pro￾portion of stiff RAP binder, which cannot be offset by even the lowest viscosity commercially 
available asphalt binder. In such a case, specially formulated chemicals, commonly referred to 
as rejuvenating agents (or rejuvenators) are typically needed (Boyer, 2000; Reinke and Glidden, 
2004; Brownridge, 2006; Mallick et al., 2010). The chemical formulation of the rejuvenator 
enables it to restore the lost fraction of the RAP asphalt binder (maltenes, which contribute 
to its fexibility and which is susceptible to oxidation), and restore the asphaltene percentage 
(asphaltenes provide the structural stiffness to the binder and are formed as a result of oxidation) 
to its original number (Figure 20.17a). An effective rejuvenator is also able to restore the adhe￾sion force and dissipated energy of the aged binder. The net result of a successful rejuvenation 
process is the restoration of the performance-related properties of the recycled mix to a level of 
a virgin mix (See Figure 20.17b). 
ISTUDYMaintenance and Rehabilitation of Pavements 631 
FIGURE 20.17 (a) Restoration of component fractions through rejuvenation (Redrawn from Brownridge, 
2010); (b) Effect of rejuvenation on stiffness of asphalt mix (Redrawn from Yu et al., 2014). 
There is a signifcant amount of recycling related research that has been completed in the recent 
past, and that is continuing at this time. Much of this research has immediate practical implications, 
while other research is at the cutting edge of science and discovering new materials and techniques 
that will probably not be implemented in the near future. However, from many such latter groups 
of studies, new understanding and discovery of fundamental concepts should be taken into consid￾eration in the light of their practical implication. This is because a good understanding of concept, 
with a frm footing on reality, is the best approach for any engineering decision. Of particular inter￾est to the practitioner is the concept of blending and chemical compatibility of asphalt—how much 
“rejuvenation” is taking place? Are the recycling agent and aged asphalt fundamentally compatible? 
Here, it is appropriate to clarify the different terms that are commonly used for additives for HMA 
recycling. As shown in Figure 20.18, the additive could be a commonly available asphalt binder of 
“softer” grade (such as lower viscosity) or a specifc recycling agent (of much lower viscosity than 
ISTUDY632 Pavement Engineering 
FIGURE 20.18 Types of recycling additives. 
that is found in commonly used asphalt binders) that can either act as a “softener” (reduce viscosity) 
or an additive that contains active ingredients, which cause a change in the chemical composition of 
the aged binder and thereby restore its properties to its original/desirable state. For a proper “reju￾venation,” the latter kind of product is generally preferable because it has been shown conclusively 
that chemical changes cause a change in the mechanical properties, and appropriate recycling agents 
can restore the properties of the aged binder to such a state that would let the recycled mix perform 
in an adequate manner both in the short and long term. 
The use of an appropriate rejuvenator has been shown to be successful in producing laboratory 
recycled HMA with 50% RAP with similar or better properties compared to HMA with 20% RAP 
(Veeraragavan et al., 2017). However, note that the effects of rejuvenators depend signifcantly on 
their type and dose (Zaumanis et al., 2014), and it is important to study the specifc types of rejuve￾nators that are likely to be used in a project and not to draw generic conclusions. 
In general, a relatively small amount of rejuvenating agent (for example, 0.9% of total mass) is 
frst utilized to bring the aged RAP binder to a certain stage, and then a conventional asphalt binder 
is added to the (Rejuvenator+RAP binder) to achieve the desired fnal grade of the binder. In prin￾ciple, a compatible rejuvenator of adequate amount will diffuse into the aged RAP binder flm and 
cause the desired changes in the aged RAP binder within the mixing time in the plant. In reality, 
the above process presents a number of challenges, primarily because of the compatibility of the 
three different types of binders that are now present in the system—aged RAP binder, rejuvenator, 
and virgin asphalt binder (NASEM, 2020). Added to this is the fact that the rejuvenation process 
(for example, the diffusion step) is signifcantly affected by temperature—generally, the process is 
better at a higher temperature (Karlsson and Isacsson, 2003; Mallick et al., 2012). However, there 
is only a limited time for which the system remains at a high temperature (during mixing). Also, 
crucial is the fact that because of the presence of the lighter fractions, the rejuvenator itself could 
become susceptible to changes (for example, resulting in a high mass loss) and should have the 
chemical integrity to complete the rejuvenation process. Failure to satisfy such criteria often leads 
to the potential of poor durability and premature failure of recycled mixes through raveling, rutting, 
cracking, and/or moisture damage. 
20.5.2.4.3 Durability Problems and Causes for High RAP Percentage Recycling 
The main problems of high RAP recycling (Recycled binder ratio of > 0.3) are associated with 
early rutting failure and long-term durability failures, which can be due to a number of reasons 
ISTUDYMaintenance and Rehabilitation of Pavements 633 
FIGURE 20.19 Durability problems in recycled mixes. 
(Figure 20.19). The primary reasons for such failures include deterioration of effectiveness with 
aging and incomplete or nonuniform rejuvenation due to incompatible materials (RAP binder, vir￾gin binder, and rejuvenating agent). Therefore, adequate testing and evaluation need to be made 
during the mix design process to screen out potentially poor-performing materials, and then opti￾mize the virgin binder and/or the rejuvenating agent content, such that the recycled mix is durable 
and performs adequately over the long term without showing rutting, cracking, or moisture damage 
under traffc and environmental conditions. 
20.5.2.4.4 Use Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) with RAP 
RAP has been incorporated into WMA using a number of technologies such as Sasobit, foamed 
asphalt, and emulsion. Performance of WMA using Sasobit and up to 45% RAP in recycled 
mixes has been reported to be satisfactory in Virginia in 2006 (Diefenderfer et al., 2007) and in 
Maryland in 2007 (Kristjánsdóttir et al., 2007). Several feld studies with Sasobit have also been 
reported by Prowell and Hurley (2007). From laboratory studies with 100% RAP mixes prepared 
at 125°C, with PG 64-28 binders containing Sasobit, Mallick et al. (2010) showed similar work￾ability, resilient modulus, and retained strengths as those from mixes which were prepared without 
Sasobit at 150°C. From another laboratory study conducted with 75% RAP and asphalt containing 
Sasobit H8 (which has a slightly lower molecular weight and a correspondingly lower melt point 
than regular Sasobit and would reduce the viscosity of the binder to a lower temperature), Mallick 
et al. (2008) concluded that it was possible to design mixes with high RAP with workability and 
mechanical properties that are similar to those of conventional HMA. Feasibility of producing 
high RAP content mixes with warm mix technology was also confrmed by Howard et al. (2009) 
from an extensive laboratory study that was carried out on Mississippi HMA mixes. Boggs (2008) 
reported a demonstration study that was carried out in South Carolina with 50% RAP using the 
Double Barrel Green System, and it indicated similar densities as HMA sections and lower rut 
depths for WMA as determined with an Asphalt Pavement Analyzer (APA) using plant-produced 
material. One important feature of this project was that the RAP was fractionated into three sizes 
prior to its use in the recycled mix. Rashwan and Williams (2012) conducted an experimental study 
to investigate whether WMA additives enable the production of high RAP content (30%) mixtures 
with comparable performance to HMA. Advera, Evotherm J1, and Sasobit were used to prepare 
samples containing 30% RAP in comparison to a control HMA mixture with respect to dynamic 
ISTUDY 
634 Pavement Engineering 
modulus and permanent deformation (fow number). The used binder was a PG 64-22, and the 
WMA mixtures were prepared at 120°C. The incorporation of RAP increased the dynamic modu￾lus of all mixtures, but the HMA mixtures were still higher than the WMA mixtures with 30% 
RAP content. Finally, the rutting resistance of WMA-aided RAP mixtures was still much lower 
compared to HMA mixes via fow number testing. Zhao et al. (2012) evaluated the performance 
difference between WMA mixtures with various RAP contents (from 0% to 50%) and HMA mix￾tures with 0% or 30% RAP in terms of the rutting resistance, moisture susceptibility, and fatigue 
resistance. A PG 64-22 binder was used to prepare the mixtures, and the Marshall mix design 
procedure was employed to design the mixture. Testing results indicated that WMA with high 
percentages of RAP exhibited higher rut resistance, better moisture damage resistance, and better 
fatigue performance. Guidelines and best practices for the use of RAP in WMA are available from 
National Asphalt Pavement Association (West, 2015). 
20.5.2.4.5 Recent Developments in Mix Design of Recycled 
Mixes with High RAP Percentage 
In the United States, although a large number of states follow the practice recommended from 
NCHRP Report 452 (McDaniel and Anderson, 2001, See Table 20.4), the latest recommendations 
are from NCHRP Report 752, which suggest the use of binder replacement ratio or RAP binder 
ratio instead of RAP percentage. If RAP is to be used in the mixture, it may be specifed accord￾ing to the percent dry weight (mass) of the mixture or by reclaimed asphalt pavement binder ratio 
(AASHTO M323, 2017). The reclaimed asphalt pavement binder ratio (RAPBR) is defned as the 
ratio of the RAP binder in the mixture divided by the mixture’s total binder content. In most cases, 
states in the United States are using a maximum of 30% RAP (or 30% RAP binder) in HMA surface 
course mixes and a higher percentage in the intermediate/base course HMA. Currently, NCHRP is 
conducting a study to increase the percentage of RAP in recycling mixes by ensuring the durability 
of such mixes (NCHRP 9-65). The recommendations from NCHRP Report 752 (NASEM, 2013, 
Figure 20.20) are to determine the critical and high and low-temperature grades of asphalt for recy￾cling, on the basis of performance tests. 
Two separate procedures have been recommended for the selection of the binder grade (when 
RAP content is known) and RAP content (when the available virgin binder grades are known), as 
shown in Figure 20.20 (McDaniel and Anderson, 2001). 
The latest recommendations regarding hot mix recycling are from NCHRP Report 752, which 
is the product of NCHRP 9-46 (Improved Mix Design, Evaluation, and Materials Management 
Practices for Hot Mix Asphalt with High Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement Content), which was spe￾cifcally conducted for improved mix design of high RAP content (25–50% or great) HMA. The

report focuses on accurate determination of RAP properties through appropriate sampling and the 
determination of virgin asphalt binder grade with the help of improved procedures (from AASHTO 
R 35 and M 323). It makes the following recommendations. 
1. Use of proper term for mix design: Use the term of RAP binder ratio instead of RAP per￾centage or “RAP binder replacement.” 
2. Improve accuracy of prediction of variability of RAP properties: Use loader or other 
power equipment to make miniature stockpiles from RAP stockpiles and fatten them with 
equipment blade using back dragging. Take a sample from at least three portions of the 
fattened surface with a square ended shovel. Repeat this technique for different areas of 
the RAP stockpile. Reduce samples to appropriate test size portions using a mechanical

is known (b) the virgin binder grade is known. 
Note: The Tvirgin equation is obtained from the blending chart, an example of which is shown inset; Tvirgin = critical tem￾perature of the virgin asphalt binder; TBlend = critical temperature of the blended asphalt binder (fnal desired); %RAP = 
percentage of RAP expressed as a decimal (0.3 for 30% RAP); TRAP = critical temperature of recovered RAP binder. The 
%RAP equation is derived from the blending charts, examples of which are shown inset. The high and low critical tem￾perature charts are drawn in the same way.

stockpiles, and Table 20.5 for the test methods, frequency, number of tests, and maximum 
standard deviation. 
3. Determination of grade of virgin binder if the RAP binder ratio is known: Select on the 
basis of true grade of the RAP binder, the high and low critical temperatures for the project 
location, and the pavement layer (use LTTPBind software) and one of the following: A. 
approximate ratio of RAP binder divided by the total binder content or, B. the high and low 
critical temperatures for the available virgin binders. The determination of the appropriate 
virgin binder grade is suggested according to equation 1. 
ISTUDYMaintenance and Rehabilitation of Pavements 637

Tc(virgin) = critical temperature (high or low) of the virgin asphalt binder 
Tc(need) = critical temperature (high or low) needed for the climate and pavement layer 
RBR = RAP Binder Ratio—the ratio of the RAP binder in the mix divided by the mix’s 
total binder content; the mix’s total binder content is an unknown prior to mix design but 
can be estimated based on historical data for the aggregate type and NMAS 
Tc (RAP Binder) = Critical temperature (high or low) of the RAP binder determined from 
extraction, recovery and PG grading.

5. Require moisture damage potential testing: Irrespective of RAP content, specify either 
AASHTO T 324 (Hamburg) or AASHTO T 283 (or variations), with appropriate criteria 
based on historical performance. 
6. Require a rutting test if a softer grade of virgin binder or rejuvenator is used: Specify 
AASHTO TP 63-07 (Asphalt Pavement Analyzer) or AASHTO T 324 (Hamburg), or 
AASHTO TP 62-07 (Flow Number); use NCHRP Report 673 for HMA, NCHRP Report 
691 for WMA. 
7. Assess low temperature properties: Use either Semi-Circular Bending (SCB) test or the 
disc-shaped compact tension (DCT) test. 
Note that no fatigue test was recommended by the authors. Currently, NCHRP is conducting a study 
to increase the percentage of RAP in recycling mixes by ensuring the durability of such mixes 
(NCHRP 9-65). 
NAPA QIP 131 (Hand and Martin, 2020) provides the latest asphalt industry guidelines for 
utilizing high percentages of RAP in recycled mixes. Recycled Binder Ratio (RBR) is defned as 
follows. 
PbRAP X PRAP PbRAS X PRAS RBR ˜ °
100 X Pb 100 X Pb total total
where 
PbRAP = binder content of RAP 
PRAP = RAP content by weight of mixture 
PbRAS = binder content of RAS (Reclaimed Asphalt Shingles) 
PRAS = RAS content by weight of mixture 
Pbtotal = total binder content of the combined mixture 
The common practice to recycled mixes with high recycled asphalt materials (RAM) is to use a 
softer virgin asphalt binder or one with a lower performance grade (PG), and/or use a recycling 
agent. The term recycling agent (RA) includes softening agents and rejuvenators. While softeners 
are low viscosity oils that reduce the stiffness of the blend of the aged binder and the added virgin 
binder, rejuvenators can additionally restore the chemical balance of the aged binder and/or reduce 
the impact of aging. Some RA may also include anti-stripping agents and/or materials to enable the 
production of warm mix asphalt (WMA). The RA dose is generally expressed as a percentage of the 
total binder, which includes the recycled and the virgin binder.

The benefts of using Recycled Asphalt Meterials (RAM) and recycling in HMA are dependent 
on the availability and cost of virgin materials, RAM, recycling agent (RA) and investments needed 
for plant equipment. 
The selection of the correct type and dose of the virgin binder and/or the RA can be done in 
two steps—binder evaluation and mix evaluation. First, the rheological properties of the blend of 
the aged binder and the added components (this includes any modifer, such as polymer) can be 
ISTUDYMaintenance and Rehabilitation of Pavements 639 
tested after aging, to ensure compatibility, and the meeting of expected target properties. Second, 
the mix, prepared with the selected type and dose of virgin binders and/or RA need to be tested 
for meeting the desired mix properties, after short and long term aging. In this respect, the use 
of the balanced mix design (BMD) testing and evaluation is currently becoming popular in the 
United States. The BMD includes appropriate tests for ensuring adequate resistance against both 
rutting and cracking (before and after aging)—short-term for rutting, and long-term for cracking. 
Moisture susceptibility tests also need to be conducted. With respect to tiers of mix design, the 
simplest consists of no extraction and evaluation of binder or blends and testing of mix only. The 
intermediate tier involves the extraction of binders (ASTM D 2172, D 8159) and testing of indi￾vidual binders and mix tests, but no testing of the blends. The third tier (comprehensive) consists of 
testing of individual binders and blends, as well as the mix. The short-term aging can be simulated 
by subjecting the mix to 135°C (AASHTO R 30) before compaction, while the long-term aging 
can be simulated by keeping compacted samples at 85°C for 5 days (AASHTO R 30). More recent 
recommendations are subjecting loose mix at 95°C for a specifc number of days, depending on 
the location. 
The earliest RAs (ASTM D 4552) were petroleum based and consisted of blends of low viscosity 
oils and virgin asphalt binders. Modern RAs consist of recycled oil and bio-based materials. 
Examples of the relevant test/properties, along with the relevant aging processes, for the binders 
include the following: 1. High PG (AASTO T 315), high temperature, unaged RTFO (AASHTO 
T 240); 2. ΔTc (AASHTO T 313), low temperature, long-term aged (RTFO and PAV, 20 hours, 
AASHTO R 28); 3. Glover-Row (G-R) parameter (AASHTO T 315), intermediate temperature, 
aged (RTFO and PAV, 20 hr and 40 hr). 
Examples of tests/evaluations for mix includes the following: 1. Number of load cycles to 12.5 mm 
rut depth (N12.5) with the Hamburg Wheel Tracking Test (HWTT) (AASHTO T 324), High 
Temperature (50°C) after short term aging (AASHTO R 30); 2. Cracking tolerance Index (CTindex) 
with the IDEAL-DT (indirect tension asphalt cracking test, ASTM D 8225), intermediate tempera￾ture (25°C), after short and long term aging (AASHTO R 30); 3. Flexibility Index (FI) with the 
I-FIT (Illinois Flexibility Index Test, AASHTO TP 124), intermediate with the Uniaxial Thermal 
(25°C), and short and long term aging; 4. Cracking Resistance Index (CRIENV) with the Uniaxial 
Thermal Stress and Strain Test (UTSST) (ASTM WK 60626) at low temperature (10°C/hr from 
20°C), after short and long term aging (AASHTO R 30). 
Note that similar to the design of virgin mixes, the mix design process of recycled mixes should 
also consider the volumetric properties (VTM, VMA, VFA). The VMA (AASHTO M 323) consists 
of the volume of air voids and the volume of the effective binder. The volume of the effective binder 
should be calculated on the basis of the dry bulk-specifc gravity (Gsb) of the virgin aggregates and 
that of the RAM aggregates. The VMA will be erroneously increased if the effective specifc grav￾ity (Gse) of the RAM aggregates is used instead of the Gsb (the absorbed binder is not taken into 
account), and the amount of error will be dependent on the difference between the Gsb and the Gse 
and the amount of RAM used. If the total binder content (Pbtotal) is used instead of the effective 
binder content (Pbe), or Pbe is calculated with Gsb and Gse (for RAM aggregates), then the dust pro￾portion (DP, ratio of percent aggregates passing the 75 μm sieve to the effective binder content) will 
be decreased. Note that an earlier specifcation recommends the use of an estimated Gsb instead of 
a measured one. 
The amount of binder that is effectively available from the RAM in the mix is also a matter 
of debate. Based on research and experience, a suitable Binder Availability Factor (BAF) (such 
as 60–90%) can be used. A less than 100% BAF, increment of minimum VMA, and optimum 
binder content are recommended for mixes containing RAS (AASHTO PP 78). These recommenda￾tions may not be followed if a suitable RA is used to conform laboratory performance (specifcally, 
cracking) after long-term aging. Recommendations may also include specifying a minimum binder 
content, decreasing design air voids and lowering the number of gyrations during the compaction 
ISTUDY640 Pavement Engineering 
of mix design samples in a Superpave gyratory compactor. Options to consider if the BMD require￾ments are not met include the following: 1. Use a different type or dose of RA; 2. Use a lower PG 
grade virgin binder with a lower Tc; 3. Change the aggregate gradation to increase the total binder 
content; 4. Reduce RAS content and reduce overall RBR. 
Plant modifcations and proper materials management are necessary to utilize RAM, specifcally 
at high contents (> 0.3) and recycle HMA effectively. These include the following: 1. Equipment 
(properly calibrated, AASHTO M 156-13) and integrated controls to blend RA in the plant (unless 
done in the tanks or at terminals); 2. Crushing, fractionating, and management of (preferably mul￾tiple) RAP stockpiles (sloped and covered, for example) for moisture and quality control during 
production (NAPA QIP-129, NAPA QIP-126); 3. Additional feed bins, drum modifcations, external 
mixer, modifed burner confguration and fighting, scalping screens, bin vibrators; 4. Counterfow 
drums, double drums (such as the Double Barrel), suitably placed RAP collars and external heaters 
and mixers, as well specialized silo and control systems for handling higher amounts of dust that are 
generated from RAP; 5. Consistent source/supply of virgin binder (two binders with the same PG 
grade but two different sources/with different composition can show signifcantly different results); 
6. Use of proper compaction equipment, training and WMA materials, if needed, for maintaining 
appropriate workability. 
20.5.2.4.6 Practical Concerns with High RAP/RAS Recycling 
The most important concern about recycling RAP and RAS is the amount of effective asphalt 
that is available from the recycled materials in the new mix. This is more of a concern for the 
RAS, which consists of less than 80% of aggregates and the remaining of very stiff binder that 
are specifcally made for serving in roofng shingles. Furthermore, because of inaccuracies in 
determining the specifc gravity of RAP aggregates, the amount of effective asphalt in a recycled 
mix could be signifcantly less than calculated, assuming full blending of the recycled asphalt. 
This could lead to the production of relatively “dry” mixes, with a potential of early failure. 
Recommended guidelines to overcome these problems include the use of solvent extraction of 
RAP and RAS aggregates to estimate the specifc gravities more accurately, use of realistic 
specifc gravities based on data from local aggregates, and using more accurate knowledge of 
the amount of the RAP/RAS binder that is actually blending in the recycling process (Davis 
and Blankenship, 2017). Examples of available guidelines for hot mix recycling are provided in 
Table 20.6.

20.6 MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION 
OF CONCRETE PAVEMENTS 
20.6.1 JOINT AND CRACK SEALING 
Cracks and joints are sealed to prevent water and noncompressible materials from entering and 
causing potential damage. Different types of sealants are used for this purpose. 
Hot-pour liquid sealants are heated and liquefed and then poured into cracks and joints. They 
can be opened to traffc after they have cooled and gained enough rigidity. They have a service life 
of 3–5 years. 
Silicone sealants are silicone polymer compounds that are poured into joints at ambient tem￾peratures. They are commonly ready for traffc loads within 30–60 min of application and have a 
service life of 8–12years. 
Compression seals are preformed rubber compounds (commonly neoprene materials) that are 
forced into a joint under compression. They form a seal by pushing against the walls of the joint, are 
immediately ready for traffc, and have a service life exceeding 15 years. 
20.6.2 SLAB STABILIZATION 
The purpose of slab stabilization is to fll voids that have been created beneath the slab due to 
a combination of pumping, erosion, or consolidation of the base. If left untreated, these voids 
could grow in size and could potentially contribute to faulting, corner breaks, or cracking. These 
voids are best flled by pumping grout (cement and fy ash slurry) through predrilled holes 
through the slab. 
20.6.3 DIAMOND GRINDING 
Diamond grinding is used to restore pavement surface friction or smoothness. The process uses 
gang-mounted diamond saw blades to grind off a thin surface layer approximately 2–20 mm thick. 
The undesirable roughness may have been caused by faulting, studded tire wear, or slab curling. 
Although not desirable for new construction, diamond grinding can also be used in newly con￾structed slabs to attain initial specifed smoothness. 
Patches constructed in rigid pavements are used to treat localized slab problems such as spalling, 
popouts, scaling, joint deterioration, corner breaks, and punchouts. A partial-depth patch is used 
if the pavement distress is limited in depth; otherwise, a full-depth patch should be used. HMA is 
commonly used for emergency patches. However, fast-setting cements are available and can be used 
to reduce the setting time to a few hours. When constructing permanent patches in PCC pavements, 
Portland cement or high early strength gain cement should be used. 
Spalls may be caused by the infltration of incompressible materials into joints when they con￾tract and open during cold weather. During warm weather the pavement expands, closing the joints. 
However, the presence of incompressible materials in the joints will prevent the joints from closing 
and produce high compressive stresses along the joint faces or walls. As these compressive stresses 
build up, they may cause spalling of the concrete along the joints. Force may cause spalling at both 
the top and bottom of the pavements. Other causes of spalling include dowel bar misalignment, cor￾rosion of metal joint inserts, reinforcing steel that has been placed too near the surface, D-cracking, 
alkali-silica reactions, and lack of consolidation of concrete near the joints. 
Partial-depth patches are used to restore localized areas of slab damage that are confned to the 
upper one-third of slab depth. This is commonly used for moderate spalling and localized areas of 
severe scaling that do not exceed 3 in. depth and that cover an area less than 12 ft2. 
Full-depth patches are used to restore localized areas of slab damage that extend beyond the 
upper one-third of slab depth or originate from the slab bottom. Full-depth patches are commonly 
ISTUDY 
 
 
642 Pavement Engineering 
used for repairing severe spalling, punchouts, corner breaks, severe slab cracking, and localized 
areas of severe scaling (ACPA, 1995). 
Additional information on methods for determining the optimal timing for the application of pre￾ventive maintenance treatments in rigid pavements can be found in NCHRP Report 523 (Optimal 
Timing of Pavement Preventive Maintenance Treatment Applications; http://onlinepubs.trb.org/ 
onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_rpt_523.pdf). 
20.6.4 LOAD TRANSFER DEVICES 
Rehabilitation of load transfer devices between two adjoining slabs involves cutting a slot perpen￾dicular to the joint between the two slabs, inserting a dowel, and reflling the slot with a fast-setting 
polymer concrete. Combined with other pavement restoration methods, rehabilitation of load trans￾fer devices has the potential to extend the service life of rigid pavements by 10–20 years, depending 
on the pavement condition at the time of the repair and subsequent pavement traffc loading and 
environmental conditions. 
In 1992, the FHWA Special Project (SP-204; FHWA, 2006) was undertaken to encourage indus￾try to develop equipment for economically constructing slots for retroft load transfer. This equip￾ment would make load transfer across faulted joints or working cracks a cost-effective maintenance 
and rehabilitation technique and would extend the service life by providing positive load transfer for 
undoweled or transversely cracked JPCP or for working cracks in under-reinforced JRCP. 
20.6.5 PRECAST PANELS FOR REPAIR AND REHABILITATION 
The use of precast concrete pavements is being evaluated for the application of rapid repair of local￾ized failures in concrete pavements (such as full-depth repairs) and to rehabilitate long lengths of 
existing poorly performing asphalt and concrete pavements. Other benefts include better control 
over concrete batching, forming, and curing; increased performance and durability from postten￾sioning; savings through reduced pavement thickness; and reduced construction time lane closures. 
FHWA demonstration projects in Michigan and Colorado using precast paving for full-depth 
repairs of jointed concrete pavements were opened to traffc within 6–8h of lane closure. Precast 
6 × 12 ft panels were used to repair deteriorated joints and slabs along sections of the interstate 
highway system. The repairs involved removal of deteriorated concrete, preparation of the base 
support, placement of a fast-setting bedding material, installation of precast panels, and installation 
of retroftted dowel bars at the transverse joints. These projects are under evaluation to determine 
long-term performance. 
In 2002, the Texas DOT successfully completed the frst pilot project utilizing precast panels for 
pavement construction. Numerous lessons were used in this pilot project, including the following 
design and construction techniques: (1) Use of longitudinal posttensioning to tie together a series 
of precast panels to provide a jointless slab length of 250 ft, where each precast panel was also 
pretensioned in the transverse direction; (2) Use of a thinner precast slab compared to the need for 
a thicker conventional jointed slab; (3) Novel posttensioning techniques; and (4) Placement of the 
precast panels directly over an asphalt concrete base or leveling course. 
Concrete Pavement Technology Program (CPTP) Task 52 is the continuation of the FHWA’s 
SP-205 feld demonstration program. The SP-205 is developing feld-tested guidance on concrete 
pavement rehabilitation and repair techniques as well as strategies that emphasizes the do’s and 
don’ts and whys and whens for concrete pavement restoration (CPR) and preventive maintenance of 
concrete pavements. The rehabilitation and maintenance strategies considered are full-depth patch￾ing, partial-depth patching, subsealing, joint resealing, retroftted load transfer, and grinding and 
grooving. Periodic evaluation of the feld test sites is being carried out under CPTP. About 40 sites 
are under evaluation.

20.6.6 PORTLAND CEMENT CONCRETE OVERLAYS 
PCC overlays are increasingly being used as a rehabilitation technique for both existing PCC and hot 
mix asphalt pavements by potentially extending service life, increasing structural capacity, reducing 
maintenance requirements, and lowering life cycle costs. Improvements in PCC paving technology 
such as the use of zero-clearance pavers, fast-track paving concepts, and high early strength PCC 
mixtures have greatly increased the ability of PCC overlays to serve as a viable rehabilitation alter￾native. The FHWA in cooperation with the American Concrete Institute (ACI) has developed a syn￾thesis report, “PCC Overlays State of the Technology Synthesis Report.” This material presents the 
latest information on the design, construction, and performance of PCC overlays. It describes design 
and construction techniques for the four types of PCC overlays that are commonly used in highway 
pavement applications: bonded, unbonded, conventional whitetopping, and ultrathin whitetopping. 
Information is also provided on the selection of PCC overlays as a possible rehabilitation alternative 
for existing pavements. 
Whitetopping is a Portland cement concrete overlay on existing asphalt concrete pavement. It can 
be used as a road surface course where other paving materials and methods have failed due to rut￾ting or general deterioration. There are three types of whitetopping: conventional (thickness greater 
than 8 in.), thin (thicknesses over 4 in. but less than 8 in.), and ultrathin (2–4in.). Ultrathin whitetop￾ping (UTW) is a bonded, fber-reinforced concrete overlay. UTW is designed for low-speed traffc 
areas or areas with a lot of stop-and-go traffc, such as street intersections, bus stops, or toll booths. 
Joint spacing is critical to a good performing UTW. The use of a short joint spacing is common in 
both directions of the slab. In effect, a mini-block paver system is formed. The limited experience 
with UTW indicates that joint spacing should be no more than 12–18 in. each way per inch of white￾topping thickness. For example, a 3-in. UTW surface should be jointed into 3 × 3 or 4 × 4 ft2. Joints 
are sawed early to control surface cracking. 
20.7 WARRANTY PROJECTS 
In many cases, pavement agencies are now requiring contractors to provide warranties for a 
given time period. Such warranties can range from a 2 year life for a chip seal to an extended 
period of say 20 year life for a pavement structure. A warranty is the contractor’s assurance 
(generally through posted bonds) that the pavement will last the number of years for which it 
has been designed and built. Warranted projects could cost higher initially but the life cycle 
cost is generally lower. The standards of performance are generally set by the agency, but the 
quality control job could be borne mainly by the contractor. Design-build jobs that are con￾ducted by one or a group of contractors are becoming more common in the area of warranted 
projects. The use of innovative concepts is widely encouraged in such projects. Contractors 
generally need to be prequalifed to bid for warranty projects, and the contractor is evaluated 
in terms of a number of factors such as quality, safety, timeliness, and contract execution for 
prequalifcation.

Airport Pavements 21
21.1 TYPES, IMPORTANCE, AND SPECIFICATIONS 
Essentially there are three different pavement areas in an airport airside—runways, taxiways, and 
ramps or aprons. Runways (Figure 21.1) are used for takeoff and landing of aircrafts; taxiways are 
pavements that connect the aprons to the runways; aprons are areas that are used for aircraft park￾ing, loading, and unloading. Generally runways can be distinguished by white marks on them, while 
taxiways have yellow markings. Helipads, used for the landing and take-off of helicopters, have a 
distinct H sign marked on the area. 
Airport pavements must be constructed under strict guidelines and specifcations to avoid dam￾age to aircrafts as well as injuries to passengers. For example, loose particles of damaged airport 
pavement mix or materials (foreign object debris, FOD) can damage aircraft engines and injure 
airport or air carrier personnel. 
An example of specifcations for airport pavement hot mix asphalt (HMA) is the Federal Aviation 
Administration’s (FAA) Item P401 (Plant Mix Bituminous Pavement; 150/5370-10G—Standards for 
Specifying Construction of Airports, https://www.faa.gov/documentlibrary/media/advisory_circular/ 
ac-150-5370-10g-updated-201605.pdf). It specifes materials, composition, construction methods, 
materials acceptance, contractor quality control, method measurement, basis of payment, as well as 
relevant ASTM and AASHTO standards. 
The FAA provides guidance for the design, construction, and maintenance of airports through 
their specifcations (www.faa.gov/airports/engineering/). AC 150/5320-6G (2021) is for air￾port pavement design and evaluation, whereas AC 150/5100-13B (2011) is for nonprimary air￾ports. The airport pavement design process has been developed from a nomograph/chart-based 
empirical procedure to spreadsheet-based design as well as the latest layered elastic analysis and 
FEM based pavement design method, FAARFIELD 2.0 (www.airporttech.tc.faa.gov/Products/ 
Airport-Pavement-Software-Programs/Airport-Software-Detail/ArtMID/3708/ArticleID/2841/ 
FAARFIELD-202). AC 150/5380-6C (2014) gives guidance on the maintenance of airport pave￾ments. Standard 150/5370-10H (2018) gives standards for the construction of airports; it contains

important updates on existing specifcations. Note that the newly released FAARFIELD 2.0 incor￾porates a number of updates from the previous version, which includes a new graphical user inter￾face; a new 3D fnite element computational library; FAASR3D; support for the new ICAO ACR; 
PCR system; the ability to add, save, and edit user defned vehicles; the ability to work with multiple 
jobs/sections at once; and an updated aircraft library (see www.faa.gov/about/offce_org/headquar￾ters_offces/ang/redac/media/airports/2021/march/airports-mar2021-FAARFIELD2.0Update.pdf). 
21.2 STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF AIRPORT ASPHALT MIX PAVEMENTS 
The FAA-specifed structural design method of airport pavements has evolved from an empirical 
CBR-based “spreadsheet” design method, which was based on the concept of equivalent load and 
departure to a layered elastic (for fexible pavements) and fnite element (for rigid pavements) based 
methods. The former method was specifed in AC 150/5320-6D, which was canceled in 2009 and 
replaced by AC 150/5320-6F that contains the new method (discussed in Section 21.5). However, in 
this book, both procedures are presented. 
The design of airport pavements can be done with airfeld pavement design software following 
the Advisory Circular AC 150/5320-6D (Airfeld Pavement Design and Evaluation). The design pro￾cess started with the basic shear failure-based California Bearing Ratio (CBR) method developed 
and modifed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 1960s and 1970s. The main drawback 
with this design method is its inaccurate representation of specifc aircraft loads/gears and limited 
outputs with a lack of ability to conduct sensitivity analysis. 
The formula for relating thickness of pavement to CBR is as follows: 
3  2  0 5. ˙ CBR ˘ ˙ CBR ˘ ˙ CBR ˘ ˜  ° ˛ ˝
where 
α is the load repetition factor 
Ac is the tire contact area, in.2 
CBR is the CBR of the layer being considered 
P is the tire pressure (psi) at depth t used in calculating the ESWL 
The basis for this formula is equal defection between the ESWL and multiple gear, assuming equal 
contact area. 
Currently, a spreadsheet-based design (based on the CBR method, with gear confgurations 
related through empirical data and theoretical concepts) is used, which has been made user-friendly 
with the use of Visual Basic macros. The design software is available at www.faa.gov/airports/ 
engineering/design_software/previous/. 
This spreadsheet-based design allows for inputs for subgrade compaction requirements, layer 
conversion, multiple subbase layers, and charts on thickness versus CBR and thickness versus 
annual departures. For the aircraft mix, the design is based on “critical aircraft,” and allows consid￾eration of frost in design. Note that the design curves on the basis of which this spreadsheet software 
has been developed are provided in Figures 3.2 through 3.15 of Advisory Circular AC 150/5320-6D. 
This design method is intended to result in pavements that would last for 20 years without needing 
any major maintenance if no major changes in forecasted traffc are encountered. 
For asphalt pavements, there are 14 design curves that give the total pavement thickness as well 
as the thickness of the HMA surface for different types of aircrafts over a particular subgrade. 
These thicknesses are provided for both critical areas (with concentrated/departing traffc) and non￾critical areas (with arriving traffc). The thickness of the HMA surface courses for noncritical areas 
is provided on the charts, whereas those for the base and subbase courses for noncritical areas can 
be considered as 0.9 times the thickness of the corresponding layers in the critical areas.

The software provides two options—the main module for designing airports with aircrafts 
heavier than 30,000 lb and a submodule one for designing airports with aircrafts weighing less 
than 30,000 lb. The design for the main module is based on a pavement structure consisting of a 
pavement surface layer (HMA), a stabilized or unstabilized base layer, a stabilized or unstabilized 
subbase layer(s), and a subgrade. 
There are 10 basic steps in the main module. For the proper completion of the design process, 
it is important that the steps are completed in the proper numerical order. (Please use Circular AC 
150/5320-6D to refer to the fgures and tables mentioned in the following steps.) 
Step 1. Enter airport name and data: this step involves the input of the airport name, city and 
state, Airport Improvement Program (AIP) project number, as well as designer’s name and 
comments, if any. 
Step 2. Enter subgrade CBR and frost code: it has been suggested that the design CBR value 
should be equal to or less than 85% of all the subgrade CBR values, which corresponds to a 
design value of one standard deviation below the mean CBR value. Knowing the type of the 
soil (such as gravelly soil), the percentage fner than 0.02mm by weight (say, 5%), and the soil 
classifcation (say, GW), one can determine the frost code (FG-1) from Table 2.4 in Advisory 
Circular AC 150/5320-6D. The frost code is used along with the frost penetration depth 
(Table 21.1) information to decide on a specifc frost protection system for the pavement. 
Note that for specifc aircraft types and loads, requirements regarding the compaction of subgrade 
of cohesive and noncohesive soils are provided in Table 3.2 in Advisory Circular AC 150/5320-6D. 
Step 3. Enter subbase information. For the subbase, the number of subbase layers, CBR, and 
frost code are required. 
Step 4. Select default aggregate base. For FAA design (P209), crushed aggregate base is the 
default which can be substituted by either aggregate case (P208) only if the gross weight 
of the design aircraft is less than 60,000 lb and the thickness of the surface HMA layer is 
increased by 1 in. or with lime rock base (P211) material. 
Step 5. Calculate frost penetration depth. This step is optional, to compare against the required 
frost protection depth. In this step, the required inputs are the Air Freezing Index (degree 
days °F) and the unit weight of the soil (in pcf). The frost penetration depth is calcu￾lated from the interpolation of the following data, developed on the assumption of a 12 in. 
(300 mm) thick rigid pavement or a 20 in. (510 mm) thick fexible pavement.

Note that the Air Freezing Index is a measure of the combined duration and magnitude of below 
freezing temperatures occurring during any given freezing season. The average daily temperature 
is used in the calculation of the Freezing Index. For example, if the average daily temperature is 12° 
below freezing for 10 days, the Freezing Index would be= 12° × 10 days = 120 degree days. It is rec￾ommended that the design Air Freezing Index be based on the average of the three coldest winters 
in a 30-year period, if available, or the coldest winter observed in a 10-year period. 
For economic reasons, the maximum depth of frost protection suggested is 72 in. There are dif￾ferent ways of providing frost protection to the pavement, depending on the frost code of the soil. 
Seasonal frosts can cause nonuniform heave and loss of soil strength during melting, resulting in 
possible loss of density, development of pavement roughness, restriction of drainage, and cracking 
and deterioration of the pavement surface. Whether such effects are possible or not depends on 
whether the subgrade soil is frost susceptible, there is free moisture to form ice lenses, and the freez￾ing front is deep enough to penetrate the subgrade soil. 
The frost susceptibility of the soil is affected primarily by the size and distribution of voids 
(where ice lenses can form), and is determined through empirical correlations from the soil classif￾cation (Unifed Soil Classifcation System) and the percentage fner than 0.02mm. The table relating 
these parameters to the frost codes is given as Table 2.4 in Advisory Circular AC 150/5320-6D. It 
can be assumed that suffcient water for creating ice lenses is present if the moisture content of the 
soil is at or greater than 70% of its saturation. It is advised that suffcient moisture for detrimental 
frost action is assumed to be present all the time. 
The protection from frost action can be provided either by making sure that deformations from frost 
actions are limited or avoided, or by making sure that the pavement has adequate structural capacity 
during the frost melting (and ignoring the heave due to freezing). The costliest option is complete frost 
protection, in which the difference between the pavement depth designed from load-carrying consider￾ation only and the depth of frost penetration (assuming the latter is greater than the former) is replaced 
with nonfrost-susceptible materials to protect the subgrade soil from frost. This could involve replace￾ment of a signifcant amount of the subgrade soil. The complete frost protection method is recom￾mended only for pavements on FG-3 and FG-4 soils, which are extremely variable in horizontal extent. 
The limited subgrade frost protection is meant for limiting the effects of frost and allowing a 
tolerable (based on experience) level of heave. In this case, 65% of the depth of frost penetration 
should be made up of nonfrost-susceptible materials. This design method is recommended for FG-4 
soils except where the conditions require complete protection, as well as for FG-1, FG-2, and FG-3 
soils when the functional requirements of the pavement permit a minor amount of frost heave. It is 
recommended that consideration be given to using transition sections where horizontal variability 
of frost heave potential permits. 
In the third method, the reduced subgrade strength method, the CBR of the subgrade is reduced 
(on the basis of the frost group/code) so as to design a thicker pavement and hence have adequate 
strength during the thawing or melting of ice lenses. The reduced CBRs versus the frost group data 
are given in Table 3.1 in Advisory Circular AC 150/5320-6D. This method is recommended for 
pavements on FG-I, FG-2, and FG-3 subgrades which are uniform in horizontal extent or where the 
functional requirements of the pavement will permit some degree of frost heave. The method is also 
permitted for variable FG-1 through FG-3 subgrades for less sensitive pavements which are subject 
to slow-speed traffc and for which heave can be tolerated. 
For airport pavements in permafrost regions, if the complete protection system is not found 
practical, the method of reduced subgrade strength can be used. The system of providing insulation 
panels to protect the permafrost can also be used (with a case-by-case approval from the FAA, as no 
design standard exists), with careful construction and possible restriction of aircraft loads to prevent 
failure of the insulation panels. 
Steps 6–8. Enter aircraft mix. There are two directives regarding the thickness of the pave￾ment over and above those that are determined through design. First, for different types 
of aircrafts (and different loads for each of those), minimum base course thickness has 
ISTUDYAirport Pavements 651 
been specifed in Table 3.4 in Advisory Circular AC 150/5320-6D. Second, for number of 
departures in excess of 25,000, the total pavement thickness should be increased according 
to Table 3.5. 
The design method is based on the determination of pavement thickness for each of the aircrafts 
in the list, with consideration of both load and number of departures, and the selection of the most 
critical aircraft, which requires the thickest pavement. If accepted by the designer, the thickness of 
the pavement required for the critical aircraft is considered as the design thickness from this point 
onward in the design process. 
In the design process, it is assumed that 95% of the gross weight is carried by the main land￾ing gears and 5% is carried by the nose gear of aircrafts. For the weights of civil aircrafts, FAA 
Advisory Circular AC 150/5300-13A can be consulted. The designs are based on the maximum 
anticipated takeoff weights with the assumption that this conservative approach would offset any 
unforeseen changes in operation and traffc, and also the ignoring of the arriving traffc. 
The design curves on which the software is based provide thickness for four different sets of 
aircrafts—single-gear, dual-gear, dual-tandem-gear, and wide-body aircrafts. Once the critical or 
design aircraft is determined, each of the other aircrafts is converted to an equivalent design aircraft, 
frst by converting into the equivalent gear, and then by converting to the equivalent annual depar￾tures of the design aircraft. Each wide-body aircraft is treated as a 300,000-lb (136,100 kg) dual￾tandem aircraft when computing equivalent annual departures. Finally, all the equivalent annual 
departures are summed up, and the pavement is designed for the design aircraft with the total equiva￾lent annual departures. However, the heaviest aircraft must be considered to provide for adequate 
thickness of the surface layer, depth of compaction, and drainage structures. 
Note that the lateral distribution of aircraft traffc along the path of travel (in the form of a normal 
distribution) or aircraft wander is taken into consideration in the design process with the help of the 
“departure-to-coverage ratio.” The input is in terms of annual departures. Departures are converted 
to “coverages.” Coverage is a measure of the number of maximum stress applications that occur on 
the surface of the pavement due to the applied traffc. One coverage occurs when all points on the 
pavement surface within the traffc lane have been subjected to one application of maximum stress, 
assuming the stress is equal under the full tire print. Assuming normal distribution of aircraft traffc 
along the travel path, each departure (also called pass) of an aircraft can be converted to coverages 
using a single pass-to-coverage ratio. These ratios are given in Table 5 in Appendix 2 of Advisory 
Circular AC 150/5320-6D. Annual departures are converted to coverages by multiplying by 20 and 
dividing that product by the pass-to-coverage ratio, which is tabulated with respect to 12 aircraft/ 
gear types. There is also a fgure in Appendix 2 of Advisory Circular AC 150/5320-6D (Figure 3), 
which shows plots of “load repetition factor” versus coverages. After the pavement is designed for 
coverages, the thickness is multiplied by the appropriate load repletion factor to determine the fnal 
thickness for each specifc type of aircraft (this step is done prior to the selection of the critical 
aircraft). 
Step 9. Compute thickness for stabilized layers. This step requires the selection of a stabilized 
layer and input of the equivalency factor, for a base and/or the top layer of the subbase 
layer(s). Guidance regarding the selection of proper equivalency factors is provided in the 
software.

EXAMPLE 21.1 
Consider airport pavements to be built on an area with subgrade soil which has the following 
properties: percentage passing No. 200 sieve = 85%; liquid limit on minus #40 material = 35%; 
plastic limit on minus #40 material = 7%; percentage fner than 0.02 mm = 12%; and results 
from three CBR tests conducted in the laboratory= 6, 8, and 7. The unit weight of the soil is 
115 pcf. 
From a weather station very close to the airport site, the average of the three coldest win￾ters in a 30-year period shows that the design Air Freezing Index is 1100° days. 
The forecasted air traffc for the airport is in Table 21.2:

1. From the plasticity chart in Figure 2.2, the soil is classifed as ML; from Table 2.3, 
the soil is described as sandy silt (Figures and Tables are in Advisory Circular AC

2. Design CBR = Average− 1 × standard deviation = 7− 1 = 6. 
3. From Table 2.4, the frost group/code = FG-4. 
4. Consider suffcient water to be present in the subgrade to cause detrimental frost 
action. 
5. Using Figure 2.7, the depth of frost penetration is 51in. 
6. Determine the required thickness of the pavement for each aircraft (Table 21.3).

requires the thickest pavement, and hence it should be considered as the critical or 
design aircraft. Since the B747-200 has double dual tandem gear, all traffc should 
be grouped into the double dual tandem confguration.

10. Final design. Final design should be made for 6855 annual departures for a B747-200 
weighing 833,000 lb. See Figure 3.7 (This fgure is reproduced as Figure 21.2 in this 
book) regarding design curves for a B747-200; designed total thickness is 47.5in. 
Next, consider Figure 3.7 (Here, Figure 21.2) again, with a subbase CBR of 20. The 
combined (base + surface) thickness is obtained as 18 in. From Figure 3.7, the thick￾ness of the HMA surface required for critical areas is 5 in. 
Therefore, the thickness of the base course is (18− 5)= 13in. (if a stabilized course with a 
1.4 layer equivalency number is used, the thickness is reduced to 13/1.4 = 9.5in.). 
The thickness of the subbase is therefore (47.5 − 18)= 29.5 in. (if a stabilized course with 
a 1.6 layer equivalency number is used, the thickness is reduced to 29.5/1.6 = 18.5 in.). 
Since the stabilized base and subbase are required for new pavements designed to accom￾modate aircraft weighing 100,000 lb or more, this should be done. For the base course, con￾sider a plant mix bituminous concrete layer with a layer equivalency of 1.4 (compared to a 
P209 crushed aggregate base). For the subbase course, consider the use of a P209 crushed 
ISTUDY 
 
654 Pavement Engineering 
aggregate base course with a layer equivalency of 1.6 (compared to a P-154 subbase course). 
Note that the frost penetration depth is 51in. Therefore, to provide complete frost penetration, 
the thickness of the pavement section should be increased from (5+ 9.5+ 18.5)= 33–51in. 
This means a layer of (51 − 33) = 18in. of nonfrost-susceptible material must be placed below 
the designed pavement section. 
The fnal design is in Table 21.6:

21.2.1 DESIGN OF FLEXIBLE PAVEMENT OVER EXISTING PAVEMENT 
For fexible pavements, two options are allowed—HMA overlay on existing fexible pavement 
and HMA overlay over existing rigid (PCC) pavement. Note that the FAA does not allow overlay 
pavement sections containing granular separation courses between the existing and new layers 
(called sandwich pavement) because of the possibility of the granular layers getting saturated 
with water, and the trapped water having a detrimental effect on the performance of the pavement. 
21.2.1.1 HMA Overlay on Existing Flexible Pavement 
For this option, the method used is known as the thickness defciency approach, and it consists of 
the following steps. 
1. Using the design curves or software presented earlier, determine the thickness required for 
a new pavement for the load and annual departures. Determine the thickness of all of the 
pavement layers. 
2. Compare the required thickness of the new pavement with the existing pavement and 
determine the thickness of the overlay. In this step, the existing base may be considered 
as the subbase and the existing surface may be considered as the base. A higher quality 
material layer may be converted to a lower quality material layer, using layer equivalencies 
provided in Tables 3.6 through 3.8 of Advisory Circular AC 150/5320–6D. While using 
ISTUDYAirport Pavements 657 
 
 
 
 
the layer equivalencies, proper consideration should be given to the condition of the exist￾ing pavement—since defects such as surface cracking, a high degree of oxidation, and 
evidence of low stability would reduce the equivalency factors. 
EXAMPLE 21.2 
Consider an existing pavement with subgrade CBR = 6; the HMA surface course is 5in. thick, 
the base course is 8in. thick, and the subbase is 12in. thick. The subbase CBR is 15in. Frost 
action is negligible. Assume an existing pavement is to be strengthened to accommodate a 
dual-wheel aircraft weighing 150,000 lb and with an annual departure level of 6000. 
HMA surface: 4in.; base: 14in.; subbase: 15in.; total thickness: 33 in. 
The total thickness required to protect the subgrade is 33 in.; the combined thickness of the 
surface, and the base should be 18 in. to protect the subbase. 
The existing pavement is 8 in. defcient in total pavement thickness. Assume that the HMA 
surface of the existing pavement can be substituted as a base layer with a layer equivalency 
of 1.5. If 4 in. of the existing HMA surface layer is considered as the base in this manner, the 
thickness of the new base becomes (8 + 4 × 1.5) = 14 in. This satisfes the base course require￾ment, leaving 1 in. of HMA surface. A 3-in. HMA overlay on top of this would satisfy the 
HMA surface thickness requirement. 
21.2.1.2 HMA Overlay on Existing Rigid Pavement with 
or without Existing HMA Overlay 
To design HMA overlay on existing rigid pavements, the thickness defciency approach, considering 
the requirement for a new rigid pavement and the existing rigid pavement, is used. The following 
formula is used: 
t 2.5 Fhd °C he ˜ ˛ 21.2 b ˝
where the different parameters are explained as follows: 
t is the required HMA overlay thickness, in. 
F is the factor controlling degree of cracking in the base rigid pavement 
hd is the exact (not rounded off) thickness of new rigid pavement required, in., considering the 
modulus of subgrade reaction, k, of the existing subgrade and the fexural strength of the existing 
concrete 
Cb is the condition factor indicating the structural integrity of the existing rigid pavement, with 
values ranging from 1 for pavements with slabs having nominal structural cracking to 0.75 for slabs 
with structural cracking 
These two conditions are explained in Figures 4.4 and 4.5 in Advisory Circular AC 150/5320-6D. 
Note that the overlaying of slabs with severe structural cracking and hence Cb less than 0.75 is not 
recommended, as this could lead to severe refective cracking. In such situations, it is advised that 
such slabs be replaced and load transfer along inadequate joints be restored (and increase Cb as a 
result) and then an overlay be applied. NDT can be used to determine an appropriate value of Cb, a 
single value is recommended to be used for an entire area, and the value should not be varied along 
a pavement feature, and he is the thickness of existing rigid pavement, in. 
ISTUDY 
 
658 Pavement Engineering 
The factor F is used to control or limit the amount of cracking expected in the concrete under￾neath the applied HMA overlay. The failure mechanism is assumed to be like this: the underlying 
rigid pavement cracks progressively with traffc load repetitions until the average size of the slab 
pieces reaches a critical value beyond which shear failure occurs with a signifcant increase in 
defection under traffc. F is considered to be a function of subgrade strength and traffc volume 
and is recommended as 1.0; it can also be determined from Figure 4.3 in Advisory Circular AC 
150/5320-6D. 
To design a HMA overlay over an existing HMA layer over an existing rigid pavement, the same 
formula given earlier is to be used, assuming that there is no existing HMA layer. Then the new 
HMA overlay thickness should be determined by subtracting from the required overlay thickness 
the thickness of the existing HMA layer or part thereof (if the existing HMA layer is not in such a 
condition as to be considered in whole). 
EXAMPLE 21.3 
Consider an existing 12-in. thick rigid pavement is to be strengthened to provide adequate 
design for 6000 departures of a dual-wheel aircraft weighing 150,000 lb. The fexural strength 
of the existing concrete is 700 psi, and the modulus of subgrade reaction is 300 pci. Cb= 0.95. 
Using Figure 3.18 (from AC150/5320-6D), the required single-slab thickness is found to be 
13.1 in. The F factor is considered to be 1. 
t = 2.5 (Fhd—Cbhe) 
t = 2.5 (1 × 13.1—0.95 × 12) 
t = 4.2in. 
Now suppose that in the existing pavement there was a 2-in. thick HMA overlay on top of 
the rigid pavement. The calculation for the required new HMA overlay would have proceeded 
as earlier, ignoring the presence of the old overlay. Now that it is known that a 4.25-in. HMA 
overlay is needed, the thickness of the existing overlay must be subtracted from 4.25 in. to 
determine the required new overlay thickness. Based on NDT and/or engineering judgment, 
it is now seen that, because of its existing condition, the existing 2-in. HMA can at best be 
considered as an HMA layer of effective thickness of 1.25 in.; the new overlay that should be 
used is (4.25 − 1.25)= 3 in. 
21.3 DESIGN OF CONCRETE PAVEMENTS 
AC 150/5320-6D specifes the design procedure for rigid pavements using charts. A subbase of at 
least 4-in. thickness is required unless certain conditions regarding soils and drainage are satisfed 
(given in Table 3.10 in AC/5320-6D). Stabilized subbases are required for all pavements carrying 
aircrafts weighing more than 100,000 lb. For the subgrade, the compaction requirements are less 
strict compared to the requirements for fexible pavements. Guidance is provided for compaction 
of cohesive and noncohesive soils (such as 90% of maximum density for cohesive soils in the fll 
sections). The use of a nonrepetitive static plate load test (AASHTO T 222) is recommended for the 
determination of the modulus of subgrade reaction, k. Recommended values for subgrades for dif￾ferent thicknesses of subbase are provided (Figure 21.5). 
The thickness of concrete slabs is determined using charts for a variety of aircrafts. The inputs 
required for using these charts are concrete fexural strength, subgrade modulus, gross weight of 
the design aircraft, and annual departure for the design aircraft. Figure 21.6 shows an example of 
ISTUDYAirport Pavements 659

21.4 DESIGN FOR AIRPORT PAVEMENTS WITH LIGHT AIRCRAFTS 
Aircrafts weighing less than 30,000 lb are characterized as light aircrafts by the FAA, and airport 
pavements handling such aircrafts are designed on the basis of methods presented in Chapter 5 of 
AC150/5320-6D. The design of fexible pavements is conducted with the use of the gross aircraft 
weight and the CBR of the subgrade (Figure 21.7). Once the total thickness of the pavement is 
determined, the thickness obtained by considering a CBR of 20 is subtracted from it to get the 
thickness of the subbase. The thickness corresponding to a CBR of 20 is made up of the surfacing 
and the base. The minimum thickness of HMA over granular base is 2 in. Note that for airports 
handling aircrafts weighing less than 12,500 lb, highway HMA mixes used by the state depart￾ment of transportation could be utilized. For rigid pavements, two thicknesses are specifed: 5 in. 
for aircrafts weighing less than or equal to 12,500 lb, and 6 in. for aircrafts weighing more than 
12,500 lb.

21.5 ADVANCED DESIGN METHODS 
The FAA has developed a suite of design methods/software FAARFIELD www.faa.gov/airports/ 
engineering/design_software) for both fexible and rigid pavements. These design methods have 
been evaluated and calibrated on the basis of full-scale testing at the National Airport Pavement 
Test Facility (NAPTF www.airporttech.tc.faa.gov/Airport-Pavement/National-Airport-Pavement￾Test-Facility-). The fexible pavement design method is based on the original layered elastic analysis 
program, LEDFAA (with LEAF as the main computational program) and utilizes subgrade strain 
and asphalt layer tensile strain as the two primary responses for design. For analysis of rigid pave￾ment a separate software, FEAFAA 2.11 is available. 
The salient features of the new layered elastic/FE based methods are as follows: 
1. A fxed 20-year design life is considered as the FAA standard. 
2. The new method analyzes the effect (damage due to) of each aircraft separately and deter￾mines a thickness that is required to resist the cumulative damage, rather than converting 
the air traffc mix to a single design aircraft and all annual departures to an equivalent 
annual departure of the design aircraft. 
3. The design for fatigue failure in the new method is based on the concept of cumulative 
damage factor (CDF) rather than on the “design aircraft.” For a single aircraft and constant 
annual departure, FAA has defned CDF as 
Number of applied load repetitions CDF ˜ Number of allowable repetitions to failure 
or 
Annual departures° life in year CDF ˜ Pass °coverages to failure Coverage ratio 
or 
Applied coverages CDF = 21.3 Coverages to failure 
4. One coverage occurs when a unit area of the pavement experiences the maximum strain for 
fexible pavement and stress for rigid pavement by a given aircraft. For fexible pavements 
and rigid pavements, the number of coverages means the measure of the number of repeti￾tions of the maximum strain occurring at the top of the subgrade, and for a rigid pavement, 
it means the measure of repetitions of the maximum stress occurring at the bottom of the 
PCC layer. The concept of effective tire width is used in FAARFIELD for calculating 
the pass-to-coverage ratio (P/C). The effective tire width in a fexible pavement, for shear 
failure of subgrade, is considered at the top of the subgrade by drawing response lines at 
1:2 slope from the edge of the contact patches on the surface to the top of the subgrade 
(either separate or combined tires). In the case of rigid pavements, the effective tire width 
is considered as the nominal tire contact patch width at the surface of the pavement. 
21.5.1 ASPHALT PAVEMENTS 
For asphalt pavements, the primary reason for moving to a more sophisticated design from the 
CBR-based spreadsheet program is the necessity to design pavements for aircrafts with signif￾cantly higher loads and more complex gear confgurations compared to the aircrafts on which the 
original design curves were developed, as well as compared to the “wide-body aircrafts” for which 
ISTUDY 
 
 
662 Pavement Engineering 
adjustments had already been made to the original design curves/methods. Two notable examples of 
such aircraft are the Boeing B777 and the Airbus A380. The load and gear confgurations of these 
aircrafts are shown in Figure 5.7 in Chapter 5. LEDFAA, being a M-E design, should be capable 
of conducting a more rational analysis and hence a more accurate design of pavements required by 
aircrafts such as the two mentioned earlier. 
The failure criteria are based on two responses: compressive strain on top of the subgrade to 
prevent rutting and the tensile strain at the bottom of the HMA layer to prevent bottom-up fatigue 
cracking. The material properties, for which default values are provided in the software, are stiff￾ness modulus, E, Poisson’s ratio, μ, and layer thickness, t. The main distinctive feature of this design 
process is the way of considering traffc and layer characteristics. There is no equivalent departure 
or design aircraft—the damage for each aircraft is calculated and added. The entire aircraft feet 
mix must be input in the design. 
The cumulative damage factor (CDF) is calculated as follows: 
CDF ˜ ° ni 21.4 
Ni
where 
ni
 are the actual passes of the individual aircraft 
Ni
 are the allowable passes of the individual aircraft 
With the CDF, 1 means the entire life of the pavement is used up. 
The gear location and lateral distribution of the aircraft along the path of travel for each aircraft 
are considered, and the CDF is calculated for each 10-in-wide strip over a total 820-in. width. Miner’s 
rule is used to sum the damage for each layer. Note that the vertical strain on top of the subgrade is 
computed at multiple points, with all of the wheels in the main gear contributing to the computed 
strain (e.g., 16 wheels for the B747 and 20 wheels for the A380). The models are as follows.

FAARFIELD/FEDFAA allows the user to input a feet of aircraft, for which an inbuilt library con￾tains all relevant information such as gear layout, loads, and tire pressure. The pavement structure 
can be checked for the aircrafts for a design period, or, for a specifc design period, the thickness 
required to be added can be determined. Note that the structural property of the layers used in this 
method is elastic modulus (E), and no longer CBR. The following expression can be used to convert 
one form to the other: E, psi = 1500 (CBR). 
21.5.2 RIGID PAVEMENTS 
For rigid pavements, the CDF is calculated using the horizontal edge stress at the bottom of the 
Portland cement concrete (PCC) layer. The edge and the interior stresses are determined using 3D 
fnite element models. The steps in design consist of the following: (1) compute interior stress, 
(2) compute 75% of the free edge stress with gear oriented parallel to the slab edge, (3) compute 75% 
of the free edge stress with gear oriented perpendicular to the slab edge, and (4) select the highest of 
the three cases as the working stress for design.

PECASE (Pavement Transportation Computer Assisted Structural Engineering) is a software 
that has been developed by the U.S. Triservices (Army, Navy, and Air Force) for the design and 
evaluation of roads and airfeld and is available from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The design 
methodology, which includes those based on CBR as well as layered elastic analysis, is presented in 
the document “UFC 3-260-02,” which is available from http://wbdg.org/ffc/dod/unifed-facilities￾criteria-ufc/ufc-3-260-02. The basic fexible pavement design approach is similar to that of the FAA 
method and allows the evaluation of fatigue under stabilized layers as well as for different seasons. 
For rigid pavement, the pavement thickness requirement is calculated using a mechanistic fatigue 
analysis, with stresses that are calculated under design aircraft with the Westergaard edge-loaded 
model. The calculated edge stresses are used in feld (full-scale accelerated loading) derived equa￾tions relating concrete fexural strength and repetitions of aircraft loadings. 
21.6 NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING AND REHABILITATION 
OF AIRFIELD PAVEMENTS 
The purpose of using nondestructive testing and evaluation is to identify failure mechanisms in 
pavements and hence to develop the most cost-effective treatments/remedies. The process of evalu￾ation should include a condition survey, a review of records, the development of a test plan, testing 
and evaluation, and the preparation of a report. 
The records should provide information on user knowledge, as built drawings, aerial photos, 
maintenance information, and results from prior evaluations. The network to be evaluated can be 
defned on the basis of type of material (such as HMA or PCC) and its use (ramp, taxiway, or run￾way), thickness, age, and/or subsurface layers. 
The condition survey is very important for checking surface conditions and for avoiding foreign 
object debris. It consists of working to identify distress—its quantity and severity—and combining 
the different data into a pavement condition index (PCI), which is related to the condition of the 
pavement. The higher the PCI, the better is the condition. The data can be used to conduct condition 
analysis and develop pavement condition versus time models using software such as MicroPaver. 
This also helps in identifying pavements whose PCIs are close to or beyond critical PCI. Functional 
characteristics such as smoothness and surface friction also require testing. 
When developing the testing plan for pavements, one can plan for destructive, semidestructive, or 
nondestructive testing. Destructive testing includes digging test pits; semidestructive testing can be 
coring or conducting a dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP); nondestructive testing can be tests such 
as falling weight defectometer (FWD) or ground-penetrating radar (GPR). 
Generally, pavement coring is done to obtain the thickness of the layers (to be used for analysis 
with GPR or FWD data) as well as to test HMA cores for their properties. The coring and removal of 
the upper layers can also provide access for DCP testing or for obtaining subbase, base, or subgrade 
soil samples. 
Soil boring can be done with a drill rig and can be done with split spoon sampling and the stan￾dard penetration test (SPT). For NDT, the DCP testing can be done to check the stiffness of the lay￾ers below the HMA layers, and the results can be converted to CBR (and to modulus, if required). 
The GPR can be used to determine the thickness of the different layers in the pavement and detect 
buried structures or hidden conditions such as voids or trapped moisture. 
The FWD is the most commonly used NDT for determination of the structural condition of the 
pavement. It applies an impulse load with a load pulse duration of approximately 25ms. It represents 
a moving load more accurately than any other existing type of defection-based NDT. 
The Road Rater, a vibratory loading apparatus, is also used for testing. It can operate at 5–60 
cycles per second, with loads of 1000–8000 lb. 
The heavy weight defectometer (HWD) is also used instead of the FWD to apply higher loads. 
However, note that if the layers are not sensitive to the load magnitude (force amplitude), the FWD 
can be used in place of the HWD. 
ISTUDY 
666 Pavement Engineering 
The FWD/HWD applies a load and simultaneously measures the defection at different loca￾tions. There are three relevant ASTM standards for defection-measuring equipment. D4695-96 
(Standard Guide for General Pavement Defection Measurements) specifes the use of static, 
vibratory, and impulse load equipment; D4602-93 (Standard Guide for Nondestructive Testing of 
Pavements Using Cyclic Loading Dynamic Defection Equipment; 2002) specifes the use of vibra￾tory testing equipment; and D4694-96 (Standard Test Method for Defections with a Falling Weight 
Type Impulse Load Device) specifes the use of impulse loading equipment. 
The data from FWD testing can be used for both qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the 
pavement. The qualitative evaluation helps in understanding the variability of structural condi￾tions within the network, whereas the quantitative evaluation provides the data needed as inputs for 
design (modulus, E). It can also provide information regarding voids in PCC and load transfer across 
joints in PCC pavements. 
The impulse or dynamic stiffness modulus (ISM or IDM) provides an indication of the stiffness 
of the overall pavement. It is defned as follows: 
I D˜ °SM ˛ L
21.9 d0
where 
L is the applied load 
d0 is the maximum defection 
The I(D)SM can be plotted along the length of a runway, for example, to evaluate the variability of 
the structural condition in the initial stage of analysis. The more detailed analysis involves back￾calculation of layer moduli, which can be used with a layered elastic design program. The back￾calculation program BACKFAA can be downloaded from the FAA website www.faa.gov/airports/ 
engineering/design_software/. 
For PCC pavements, closed form solutions are used for the determination of stiffness from FWD 
test results. Test locations are at the center of the slab for layer properties, transverse joints for load 
transfer, slab corners for voids, and longitudinal joints for load transfer. Load transfer effciency as 
well as voids can be evaluated. 
The results of back-calculation analysis can be used in both the spreadsheet-based CBR design 
and LEDFAA. The back-calculated modulus of the subgrade can be used directly in LEDFAA, 
while it can be used to estimate CBR (through correlation, E = 1500 CBR) to be used in the spread￾sheet design. In the pavement evaluation part, the primary inputs are traffc, pavement thickness and 
composition, pavement condition, layer properties, and subgrade strength. 
Traffc, in the form of aircraft type, frequency, and weights, can be obtained from the airport 
master plan (forecast) as well as from the airport manager’s offce. The pavement thickness and 
composition data can be obtained from cores, test pits, as built plans, and pavement management 
system reports. 
The pavement condition inputs come from analysis of pavement condition data, which includes 
description and quantity of distresses and the PCI at different points along the feature. The layer 
properties include moduli values back-calculated from FWD, DCP, thicknesses from cores or GPR, 
and laboratory testing (split tensile test for PCC, and CBR on soils from boring). 
For analysis of NDT data for estimation of layer properties for use in spreadsheet design, one can 
evaluate defection basins, select analytical sections, and determine subgrade modulus—and then 
estimate CBR from correlation. The conventional FAA design method is based on CBR for fexible 
pavements and the Westergaard method for rigid pavements. For mechanistic methods, the layered 
elastic method is used for fexible pavements (which can be assumed as semi-infnite layers), and 
FEM is used for rigid pavements (which have joints). 
ISTUDYAirport Pavements 667 
The report of output of the pavement evaluation process includes allowable loads and the remain￾ing life of a pavement feature (such as a runway). For the design aircraft, the allowable loads for 
different sections of the pavement are determined, and the lowest allowable load in that pavement 
is reported. Similarly, for the different sections the allowable number of load repetitions and hence 
the remaining lives are determined. 
21.7 ACN-PCN 
All airports in countries belonging to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) are obli￾gated to report the strength of pavements (with bearing strengths greater than 12,500 lb) in terms 
of a standardized system, known as the ACN-PCN system. Details of this method and relevant 
calculations are provided in Advisory Circular AC150/5335 5C. 
ACN is defned as a number that expresses the relative effect of an aircraft at a given confgu￾ration on a pavement structure for a specifed standard subgrade strength. PCN is a number that 
expresses the load-carrying capacity of a pavement for unrestricted operations. 
The ACN-PCN system is structured so that a pavement with a particular PCN value can support, 
without weight restrictions, an airplane that has an ACN value equal to or less than the pavement’s 
PCN value. This is possible because ACN and PCN values are computed using the same technical 
basis. Note that the ACN-PCN system is only intended as a method of reporting relative pavement 
strength so airport operators can evaluate the acceptable operations of airplanes and is not meant 
for pavement design or evaluation. 
The ACN-PCN system is based on four standard levels of subgrade strengths (modulus of sub￾grade reaction for PCC pavements and CBR for fexible pavements). The ACN for each aircraft is 
provided by the aircraft manufacturer and can be determined using the FAA’s COMFAA software 
www.faa.gov/airports/engineering/design_software/. 
The ACN for rigid pavements is derived on the basis of the Westergaard solution for a loaded 
elastic plate on a Winkler foundation (interior load case), assuming a concrete working stress of 
399 psi. For fexible pavements, the CBR method based on Boussinesq’s solution for stresses and 
displacements in a homogeneous, isotropic elastic half-space is used. 
To standardize the ACN calculation and to remove operational frequency from the relative rating scale, 
the ACN-PCN method specifes that ACN values be determined at a frequency of 10,000 coverages. 
A single wheel load is calculated to defne the landing gear–pavement interaction for each type 
of pavement section. The derived single wheel load implies equal stress to the pavement structure 
and eliminates the need to specify pavement thickness for comparative purposes. This is achieved 
by equating the thickness derived for a given airplane’s landing gear to the thickness derived for a 
single wheel load at a standard tire pressure of 181 psi (1.25MPa). The ACN is defned as two times 
the derived single wheel load (expressed in thousands of kilograms). 
The determination of a pavement rating in terms of PCN is a process of determining the ACN 
for the selected critical (i.e., most demanding) airplane and reporting the ACN value as the PCN for 
the pavement structure. 
The PCN can be determined in two ways—the airplane method (simpler) or the technical evalu￾ation method (requires more time and resources). 
The airplane method is useful when information on traffc and runway characteristics is limited, 
and engineering analysis is neither possible nor desired. In the airplane method, the ACN for all 
airplanes currently permitted to use the pavement facility is determined and the largest ACN value 
is reported as the PCN. The assumption in using this method is that the pavement structure has the 
structural capacity to accommodate all airplanes in the traffc mixture and that each airplane is 
capable of operating on the pavement structure without restriction. Note that the pavement capacity 
can be signifcantly overestimated if an excessively damaging airplane, which uses the pavement on 
a very infrequent basis, is used to determine the PCN. 
ISTUDY668 Pavement Engineering 
EXAMPLE 21.4 
Consider a fexible pavement runway with a subgrade strength (CBR) of 10 and traffc having 
the operating gross weights and ACNs shown in Table 21.8. 
The PCN should be expressed as follows: 
TABLE 21.8 
Aircraft Data for Example 21.4 
% Gross Weight 
Operating Tire Pressure on Main Gear ACN (from Annual 
Aircraft Weight (lb) (psi) for ACN COMFAA) Departures

PCN (highest number from the aforementioned table)/F or R (depending on fexible or 
rigid)/code for CBR (given in Table 2.2)/code for tire pressure (given in Table 4.2)/U or T 
(depending on whether the airplane method or the technical evaluation method is used, 
FAA 150/5335-5D, www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/150-5335-5D￾pavement-strength.pdf). 
Therefore, in this example, the PCN is 
PCN57/F/B/X/U 
FAA discourages the use of the aircraft method on a long-term basis because of the potential 
inaccuracies. The technical evaluation method of calculating PCN is explained in Appendix B 
(with examples in Appendix C) of AC 150/5335-5C. COMFAA (www.faa.gov/airports/engineer￾ing/design_software/) can be utilized to calculate the PCN using this method. The basic steps, as 
mentioned in AC 150/5335-5C, are as follows: (1) determine the traffc volume in terms of type 
of aircraft and number of annual departures/traffc cycles of each aircraft that the pavement will 
experience over its life; (2) determine the appropriate reference section to use based on the number 
of wheels on main gears; (3) determine pavement characteristics, including the subgrade CBR and 
equivalent pavement thickness; (4) calculate the maximum allowable gross weight for each aircraft 
on that pavement at the equivalent annual departure level; (5) calculate the ACN of each aircraft 
at its maximum allowable gross weight; and (6) select the PCN from the ACN data provided by all 
aircraft. Pass, coverage, and traffc cycle ratio are defned in AC 150/5335-5C. 
Note that in the new AC 150/5335-5D, the Aircraft Classifcation Rating (ACR)- Pavement 
Classifcation Rating (PCR) method has been introduced. Layered elastic analysis is used for the 
calculation of ACR (two times the mathematically derived single wheel loads)/PCR (largest ACR 
value or ACR of critical aircraft) through mathematical models—the calculation can be done with 
FAARFIELD 2.0. 
21.8 REHABILITATION OF PCC AIRPORT PAVEMENTS 
The fnal step is to decide on the rehabilitation option, depending on whether the problem is func￾tional or structural. In deciding on a specifc method, the considerations should include those of 
ISTUDYAirport Pavements 669 
 
economy, in terms of initial construction cost as well as life cycle cost (in terms of present worth), 
operational disruption, local capabilities, and reliability. Alternatives include mill and fll, perpetual 
pavement, overlay, break and seat, rubblization, recycling, or reconstruction. 
The condition of the pavement section is measured in terms of serviceability, expressed as a 
PCI. The serviceability of a pavement goes down with time after construction, and there is a critical 
PCI (65 for primary airports and 55 for small airports) below which rehabilitation must be done 
to improve the condition of the pavement. If the condition of a pavement warrants rehabilitation, 
as mentioned earlier, an investigation must be conducted to determine the cause of the failure and 
select the best rehabilitation alternative. The investigation can be done on the basis of existing 
information, a visual condition survey (as part of the pavement management system), nondestructive 
testing, pavement coring and boring, traffc and pavement analysis, as well as drainage analysis. 
There are two available options for rehabilitating a PCC airport pavement using HMA. The frst 
is an HMA overlay over the existing PCC pavement, with saw cut and seal on top of the joints or 
providing a crack relief layer. The second is the application of an HMA overlay over a fractured or 
rubblized PCC pavement. 
The sequence of work in the frst option with the crack relief layer includes repairing the existing 
concrete slabs, installing edge drains, placing a crack relief layer, providing a HMA leveling course, 
and fnally applying a HMA surface course. The work with the crack/break and seat approach 
includes removing the HMA overlay, if any; correcting drainage problems; cracking/breaking 
concrete; seating cracked pieces; removing and patching soft areas; sweeping pavement surfaces; 
applying a tack coat; and placing an HMA leveling and surface course. The modulus of cracked/ 
broken and seated concrete can be between 500 and 800 ksi. The rubblization process includes 
removing HMA overlay, if any; correcting drainage problems; rubblizing PCC pavement (generally, 
the top half or two-thirds is rubblized); rolling rubblized concrete; and placing HMA leveling and 
overlay courses. The modulus of rubblized concrete can range from 200 to 500 ksi. 
The break and seat process is considered to be more costly and more effective compared to the 
rubblization process. 
21.9 CONSTRUCTION QUALITY CONTROL 
AND ACCEPTANCE TESTING 
The FAA’s Advisory Circular 150/5370-10G presents standards for specifying the construction of 
airports. The main features of the quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA) of HMA (which 
is specifed under P401 specifcations) are that the contractor has the full responsibility for all QC 
testing, and the engineer has the full responsibility for all QA testing, with the provision that in 
both QC and QA, the testing laboratory (or laboratories) meets the requirements of ASTM D 3666 
(Standard Specifcation for Minimum Requirement of Agencies Testing and Inspecting Bituminous 
Materials). The contractor must employ technicians who are certifed by the appropriate agency and 
should submit the QC plan to the engineer. 
The main scope of work for QC includes the following: 
1. Asphalt content: a minimum of two tests per lot 
2. Aggregate gradation: a minimum of three per lot 
3. Moisture content of aggregate: a minimum of one per lot 
4. Moisture content of mixtures: a minimum of one per lot 
5. Temperature: a minimum of four times per lot to determine temperatures of the dryer, 
asphalt in the storage tank, mixture at the plant, and mixture at the site 
6. In-place density: required to ensure that specifed density is achieved 
7. Sampling: at the discretion of the engineer 
8. Control charts: for the production process 
9. Documentation: includes daily reports 
ISTUDY 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
670 Pavement Engineering 
The main scope of work for QA involves the following: 
1. Tests for stability, fow, and air voids: For each sublot and evaluation of acceptance on the 
basis of the percent within limits (PWL) specifcation; air voids are calculated on the basis 
of the maximum specifc gravity measured in each sublot. 
2. Mat and joint density: Evaluation of acceptance for each lot on the basis of PWL; cores 
from mats are taken at a minimum of 1 ft distance away from the joint; location of method 
of determination of joint density (such as with cores taken directly at the joint) varies; 
evaluation of acceptance of joint density on the basis of PWL; one core is taken from each 
of four sublots in a lot. 
3. Thickness: measured from cores taken for density measurement. 
4. Smoothness: measured with a 12-ft straight edge perpendicular and parallel to the center￾line at a minimum distance interval of 50 ft; compacted surface shall not vary more than 
3/8 in. for base courses and 1/4 in. for surface courses; remedial actions are required when 
more than 15% of all measurements within a 2000 yd2 lot exceed tolerance. 
5. Grade: measured by running levels at intervals of 50 ft or less; compacted mat shall not 
vary from the gradeline elevations and cross sections shown in the plans by more than 1/2 
in.; remedial actions are necessary, when more than 15% of all the measurements within a 
lot are outside the specifed tolerance. 
EXAMPLE 21.5 
For plant-produced mix, variability of the following can be found: 
1. Stability (lb) = ± 270 
2. Flow (0.01 in.) = ± 1.5 
3. Air voids (%) = ± 0.65 
For in-place mixes (results from tests with cores, which are compared to results from tests on 
laboratory-compacted samples) a few of the important items are as follows: 
1. For mat density, contractor should target 98.5% (mat density variability is 1.3%). 
2. For joint density, contractor should target 96.5% (joint density variability is 
2.0%–2.1%). 
3. For air voids, mixes designed at 3.5% have the most tolerance for acceptance. 
A few other important items are as follows: 
1. During production, check stability and fow on the job mix formula. 
2. Obtain thickness from cores. 
3. Resampling is done for mat density only. 
4. Test section is required, whose dimensions are provided, along with specifc instruc￾tions regarding how it should be tested (“300 ft long, 20–30 ft wide with a longitudi￾nal joint included; treated as a lot with three sublots for acceptance and pay”). 
21.10 CONSTRUCTING, CHECKING, AND IMPROVING 
FRICTION/SKID RESISTANCE DRAINAGE OF RUNWAYS 
Checking the friction numbers of runways and improving them if necessary are critical for the safe 
operation of airports. Good friction is important for traction and good braking performance, and to 
ISTUDYAirport Pavements 671 
 
avoid skidding and loss of control of aircrafts. Good friction is provided as surface fnish, as well as 
through regular checking and maintenance operations. FAA Advisory Circular AC 150/5320-12C 
provides guidance on the measurement, construction, and maintenance of skid-resistant airport 
pavement surfaces. 
For the design and selection of construction materials of pavement structures, drainage fac￾tors (such as slope) and micro and macrotexture of the surface should be taken into consideration. 
Microtexture, contributed by fne-particle surfaces, provides friction at low speeds and when mak￾ing contact between tire and residual rainwater; while macrotexture, provided by the roughness of 
the pavement surface as a whole, is more important at high speeds, and for providing drainage dur￾ing rainstorms. Macrotexture can be improved by selecting suitable coarse aggregates (those with 
resistance to polish, a rough texture, and an angular shape). Skid resistance for asphalt mix pave￾ments can be improved with the use of a 0.75–1.5-in. thick layer of permeable friction course (PFC), 
which has coarse gradation and large interconnected voids for the quick drainage of water. Chip 
seals and aggregate slurry seals can also be used for temporary enhancement of skid resistance. For 
PCC pavement, brush, broom, or burlap drag or wire combing/wire tining can be used to texture the 
surface while it is still in plastic state. 
For both asphalt mix and PCC pavements, grooving can be done by the transverse saw cut 
method. For new asphalt mix pavements, grooving is recommended after 30 days of paving; while 
for PCC pavements, a vibrating ribbed plate or a ribbed roller can be used to cut grooves while it 
is in plastic state, or a saw cut can be used if it is in a hardened state. The FAA specifes the depth 
and width of grooves as 1.4 × 1.4 in., at 1/2 in. center-to-center spacing, for the entire runway, 
perpendicular to the direction of aircraft movement. Note that the transverse grooving is done 
actually to facilitate forced escape of water under fast moving aircraft traffc (during rainstorm) 
and hence improve contact between tire and the pavement surface and reduce the chance of 
hydroplaning. 
Over time, the skid resistance of surfaces deteriorates due to the polishing action of the aggre￾gates as well as the accumulation of materials such as rubber from tires (especially in touchdown 
areas) in the void spaces of PFCs or surface grooves. The problem is made worse by the spilling of 
jet fuels and presence of ice and snow on the pavement surface. Therefore, regular friction surveys 
at specifed intervals (depending on the number of jet aircrafts landing daily per runway end, speci￾fed by the FAA) should be conducted, using continuous friction-measuring equipment (CFME), 
preceded by visual inspection. In addition, periodic inspection of groove depth should be made, and 
corrective actions should be taken if 40% of the grooves are found to be equal to or less than 1/8 in. 
in depth and/or width for a distance of 1500ft. 
The friction surveys should be conducted 10 and 20 ft to the right of the runway centerline at 
speeds of 40 and 60 mph, using water from the CFME equipment to wet surfaces in front of the 
friction-measuring tires to provide water of at least 0.04 in. depth. Periodic inspections of water 
accumulation in depressed areas during rainstorms must be made, and corrective actions should be 
taken for water depths exceeding 1/8 in. The FAA provides friction numbers (Mu) for minimum, 
maintenance/planning, and new constructions, depending on the type of equipment used, for 40 
and 60 mph measurements. For example, the three numbers for the Dynatest Runway Friction tester 
(Figure 21.9) are 0.5, 0.6, and 0.82, respectively, for 40 mph, and 0.41, 0.54, and 0.72 for 60 mph 
testing. The NASA grease smear method is used for evaluating the macrotexture of the pavement 
surface. 
The rubber removal techniques may affect the structural integrity of the pavement, and hence 
the use of PFCs in airports with aircraft traffc has not been recommended by the FAA. Generally, 
contaminants such as rubber are removed by using high-pressure water, approved chemicals, high￾velocity impacts, or mechanical grindings, under dry conditions, until the friction number of the 
contaminated area has been raised to within 10% of that of the uncontaminated areas. Also, to check 
whether the techniques result in structural damage, a test section can be used for demonstration. 
Painted areas in airport pavements can provide less friction, and the skid-resistance properties of 
such areas can be improved by adding silica sand or glass beads to paints.

Guidelines regarding airport pavement roughness criteria (profling equipment and procedures, 
data reduction and simulations, and profle index) are provided by the FAA in AC No: 150/5380-9 
(www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/150_5380_9.pdf). Guidelines for mea￾surement, quantifcation and application of runway roughness are also provided by the Boeing 
company at www.boeing.com/assets/pdf/commercial/airports/faqs/roughness.pdf. An application 
of the criteria for temporary ramping during surface overlay construction is also provided. A soft￾ware, ProFAA for computing pavement elevation profle roughness index, is also available at the 
FAA website (www.airporttech.tc.faa.gov/Airport-Pavement/Nondestructive-Testing-Technology/ 
NDT-Technology/ProFAA). 
21.11 ASPHALT MIXES FOR AIRPORT PAVEMENT 
The mix design procedures discussed in Chapter 13 are applicable for airport pavements. In 
many cases (such as FAA), the Marshall design procedure is being used, although a change to the 
Superpave (as discussed in Chapter 9) system is expected in the near future. There are some specifc 
issues regarding the mix design and construction of asphalt mix pavements for airports, which are 
discussed next. 
21.11.1 FUEL-RESISTANT MIX 
Jet fuel from parked aircrafts can damage asphalt mix on the surface, through raveling and loss of 
materials, rutting, and shoving. Coal tar-based sealants can be effective in resisting this damage, 
but their use is not preferred due to their signifcantly different coeffcient of thermal expansion (as 
compared to HMA) and potential of cracking and health hazards through exposure to fumes and 
direct contact. More and more, specially formulated polymer modifed asphalts have been used 
to prepare fuel resistant HMA. Mass loss (e.g., maximum allowable 1%) of an asphalt mix when 
immersed in jet fuel for 24 h (plain immersion or immersion and application of brushing) has been 
used to check the suitability of a material. Coal tar sealers have been applied in the past, although 
currently specialty products (tar free), such as Sealofex and StellaFlex FR, are being used. Fuel￾resistant asphalts (often modifed with polymer) have been used in many airports such as those 
ISTUDYAirport Pavements 673 
 
 
 
in Boston and New York City (La Guardia), the United States; Cairo, Egypt; Saint Maarten, the 
Netherlands; and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 
21.11.2 CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE OF LONGITUDINAL JOINTS 
Damaged longitudinal joints are of very serious concern in airfield pavements. Loose materi￾als from such areas can cause FOD to aircrafts, leading to loss of life and equipment. The 
different good techniques discussed in Chapter 13 can be adopted for airfield pavement con￾struction for obtaining good joints. Wherever possible, suitable-size aggregates (finer aggre￾gates produce better joints) and echelon paving should be used. Typical distresses such as 
cracking and raveling in longitudinal joints happen in about 4–5 years after construction. 
Initially a crack occurs along the joint, which leads to secondary cracks. Such cracks should 
be sealed promptly before they become a problem. Hot poured rubberized asphalt is usually 
used for crack sealing. 
21.11.3 TIME OF CONSTRUCTION 
In many cases, airport pavement work is conducted at night under a tight schedule (to avoid busy 
hours of aircraft traffc). Proper management of construction work is crucial for a successful opera￾tion, and contractors with proven experience in handling airport jobs are preferred. Mixes and 
materials must be obtained from plants that are close by, and if required, mixes that require lower 
temperatures and can be stored on site (such as warm mix asphalt) can be considered. 
21.11.4 DEICING AND ANTI-ICING 
Ethylene glycol is commonly used for anti-icing and deicing of runway. Typically this fuid is made 
up of 90% of ethylene glycol and 10% water. For deicing of aircrafts, Type I and IV fuids are com￾monly used. Type I fuid, which consists of primarily propylene glycol or ethylene glycol, is used 
for deicing and cleaning of aircrafts on the apron during deicing operations at the gate. Type IV 
fuid is used to improve hold over times once the aircraft is already deiced and is designed to slide 
off the aircraft prior to lift off. This fuid is generally made up of about 65% glycol and a polymer 
thickener to create a gel. 
21.12 MAINTENANCE OF AIRPORT PAVEMENTS 
A variety of maintenance techniques are available for asphalt and concrete airport pavements, 
as summarized in Table 21.9. ACRP Synthesis 22 (http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp/ 
acrp_syn_022.pdf) gives a complete synthesis of different maintenance and rehabilitation (pres￾ervation) techniques and also provides a catalog (in the form of fact sheets) for the different 
techniques. 
The reader is also advised to download the asphalt and concrete airport pavement related reports 
from the Airport Asphalt Pavement Technology Program (AAPTP) and from 
www.eng.auburn.edu/research/centers/ncat/research/aaptp/

21.13 COMMON PROBLEMS IN AIRPORT PAVEMENTS 
The most common problems that have been noticed in asphalt pavements in airports are groove 
closure and shear failures (surface shearing, and shoving) in areas of braking and turning of air￾crafts. Groove closures are caused by a combination of high temperatures and slow moving traffc 
in a direction parallel to the direction of the grooves, such as that near the intersection of a taxiway 
with a runway. The shear resistance of the asphalt mastic can be improved to increase the resis￾tance to grove closing, which reduces the skid resistance of the pavement. Failures are also caused 
by sluing, which results from dragging of wheels under the wings of some aircrafts (such as the 
B747-400) which do not turn during the turning of the aircraft. The shearing failure is facilitated 
by the reduced confnement of the mix on the surface, and reduced stiffness of the mix, at elevated 
temperatures. FOD that is generated from shear failures, and water ingress through failed area 
can lead to secondary problems. To prevent such problems, the use of modifed mixes or “high 
stability” mixes seem to be the most common approach (for example, SMA, mixes with high stiff￾ness asphalt binder, Monismith et al., 2000, polymer modifed asphalt, and the Beton Bitumeux 
Aeronautique, BBA, Hakim et al., 2014). PFC and SMA have also been used to obtain high skid 
resistance without grooving. To avoid slippage failures between successive lifts, good construc￾tion practices such as cleaning of layer surface and the application of a proper tack coat, before 
the placement of the next layer is required. A comprehensive summary of asphalt pavements in 
airports is provided by White (2018). 
Heymsfeld and Tingle (2019) provide a comprehensive review of current structural design pro￾cedures for airfeld pavements. They mention fve design systems: FAARFIELD from U.S. FAA

Evaluation, published in 2021, FAA, 2021), Alize-airfeld from the French Aviation Authority (Balay

et al., 2010), the Airport Pavement Structural Design System (APSDS) from Australia (Wardle and 
Rodway, 1995), the PCASE (Pavement Transportation Computer Assisted Structural Engineering), 
developed by the U.S. Army Engineering Research and Development Center (Adolf, 2010) and 
PAVERS (Pavement Evaluation and Reporting Strength) from the PAVERS consulting frm in the 
Netherlands (PAVERS, 2022). These procedures differ in one or more of the following aspects: 
critical responses, distresses, response locations, damage calculations, aircraft wander, material 
properties, environmental factors, type of materials and type of aircrafts. There are three primary 
sources of data for calibrating transfer functions for distresses: the U.S. FAA National Airport Test 
Facility (NAPTF), The U.S. Army Engineering Waterways Experiment Station (WES) or ERDC, 
and the AIRBUS Pavement Experimental Program (PEP) in France. Research is being carried out 
to incorporate Artifcial Neural Network (ANN) into airport pavement design (Kaya et al., 2018; 
Rezaei-Tarahomi et al., 2017). Recent developments also includes the consideration of top down 
cracking as a distress in rigid airfeld pavements (Rodchenko, 2017; Kaya et al., 2018). 
For detailed discussion on the calculation of Structural Condition Index (SCI), the structural 
component of Pavement Condition Index (PCI), the reader is referred to Garg et al. (2004, acces￾sible from www.tc.faa.gov/its/worldpac/techrpt/ar04-46.pdf). The authors discuss their fndings on 
the operational life of pavements and conclude that different types of pavements may exceed the 
threshold SCI but have different PCI. They stress the importance of following appropriate material 
preparation, construction, and maintenance in conjunction with structural design to ensure appro￾priate design life.

Nondestructive Tests 22
Nondestructive tests used in pavement engineering can be broadly divided into several categories: 
nuclear equipment, defection based, electromagnetic, and seismic equipment. Examples of such 
equipment are discussed in the following sections. 
22.1 NUCLEAR GAGE 
The basic operational principle of a nuclear gage is that a source (such as Cesium-137) of nuclear par￾ticles (such as photons) is inserted into (e.g., 6in.) or placed on the surface of the layer whose density is to 
be measured. As these particles are released into the layer, a detector on the equipment on the surface of 
the layer detects and counts the number of particles coming back to that point. As the density increases, 
the number of detected particles decreases. Working on this principle, the gage is calibrated using a 
block of known density, and then it is used for determining the density by using the calibration factor. 
The properties that can be measured include the density of hot mix asphalt (HMA) or soil as well 
as the moisture content of soil. The mode of transmission of the particles from the source inside the 
layer to the detectors can be either direct (when the source is inserted into the layer) or backscatter 
(in which case the particles are refected off layers, when the source is placed on the surface). A set 
of Geiger-Mueller tubes is used as detectors (two are used for a thin-layer density gage) for measur￾ing density, whereas a He-3 tube is used as a detector (of neutrons) for moisture content. The avail￾able nuclear gages have suffcient capabilities of storing data that can be collected from multiple 
tests and are generally powered by rechargeable NiCd batteries. 
The relevant American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard is D6938. The equip￾ment needs to be verifed for calibration (ASTM D 7759) by measuring the density of a block of 
known density, ensuring that the reading is within a specifc range of the actual density of the mate￾rial at each depth, and comparing the densities measured at any time to those measured earlier (say, 
an average of the last four). Factors that can infuence this “standard count” include temperature, the 
time elapsed between measurements, the presence of any affecting material (such as a wall, other 
gage, or person) close to the gage, and operator error. In the backscatter technique, the measure￾ments are very sensitive to surface roughness, and special care must be taken to make the surface 
level with water or fne sand (note that this leveling would increase the density by 1%–1.5%). 
The ratio of the particle count obtained on a test material to that obtained from a standard block is 
known as the count ratio. The gage is calibrated by measuring the count ratio for blocks of materials 
such as aluminum, magnesium, granite, and limestone of known densities. Procedures are available for 
ensuring the short-term and long-term electronic stabilities of the system and correcting measurement 
anomalies due to factors such as a natural decrease in intensity of particles due to decay of the source 
material, test location close to a wall, varying material composition or surface features, and absorption 
of rays because of the elemental composition of the material. Typical equipment is shown in Figure 22.1. 
22.2 FALLING WEIGHT DEFLECTOMETER 
A falling weight defectometer (FWD) is extensively used for estimation of pavement layer moduli 
and for determination of the structural condition of pavements (Alavi et al., 2008). The informa￾tion obtained from FWD testing can be used in structural analysis to determine capacity, estimate 
expected performance life, and design a rehabilitation plan for pavements. Defections prior to and 
after pavement rehabilitations are done to evaluate the effectiveness of specifc rehabilitation meth￾ods. An FWD can also be used to test load transfer effciency (LTE) of joints within concrete pave￾ments. American Society for Testing and Materials standards are available for the use of an FWD

for pavement defection-based testing (see ASTM 4694, 4695–96). Standard calibration procedures 
for load cells and defection sensors are also available. 
In this testing, an impulse load is generated by dropping a mass ranging from 6.7 to 120 kN through 
different heights onto a base plate through a set of rubber buffers (Figure 22.2). There are two sets of 
sensors—a load cell to measure the applied load and an array of geophones (which are located on the 
surface of the pavement) to measure the resulting defection. FWD tests can be conducted at different 
load levels, although some protocols would require the defections to be normalized to a 9000-lb load 
and “corrected” for temperature (if different from the standard 77°F). For example, 
. AdjustedCenter Deflection D 1 598837 ° 0 009211683˛T0 96 ˜ o ˝ . . ˙ 22.1
where T is the temperature of the asphalt pavement surface (°F). 
An example of FWD equipment is the Dynatest Model 8000 FWD, which has a load range of 
7–120 kN. It is a fast (up to 60 test points per hour) and reliable tool that can be operated by a single 
person. This is self-suffcient equipment, with sensors for the measurement of air and surface tempera￾ture and includes Windows-based ELMOD 4 software for data analysis. Two recent developments are 
the truck mounted defectometer (TMD) in which the defectometer is not on trailer but is mounted 
on a standard pickup truck (Ford F-350) bed to ft areas with shorter test length platforms, and the fast 
falling weight defectometer (FWD) which operates on electricity and does not use hydraulics for the 
raising and lowering of weights (faster and quieter) and also can be operated remotely (Figure 22.3). 
22.2.1 DIRECT USE OF DEFLECTIONS 
Using the defections noted at the different sensors, a series of expressions can be used to determine 
relevant properties of the pavement, such as the following. 
The area parameter (which can be used together with the center defection) represents the nor￾malized area of a slice taken through the defection basin from 0 to 0.9 m (0 to 3 ft):

22.2.2 BACK-CALCULATION 
Another approach to using the FWD data is to “back-calculate” moduli of the different layers 
of the pavement using mechanistic principles. This process involves using layer thickness and 
Poisson’s ratio (which must be known, estimated, or assumed with reasonable accuracy), assum￾ing moduli of the different layers (“seed” moduli), and determining the different defections 
at the locations of the FWD sensors. The process is repeated until the calculated defection 
basin is found to be approximately identical to the measured defection basin (within tolerances). 
An example of a criterion to stop the back-calculation process is that the summation of the 
“errors” (the difference between calculated and actual defections) is < 5%. Note that the modu￾lus of the subgrade can be determined from the FWD defections at the outer sensors without 
back-calculation. 
Back-calculation can be done by different software, some of which is freely available. The 
BAKFAA software is available free from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) website at 
www.faa.gov/airports/engineering/design_software (2016). The software uses interactive elastic 
ISTUDY 
682 Pavement Engineering 
layer analysis with FAA layered elastic analysis program LEAF. A set of seed values for the moduli 
of the different layers (maximum of 10 layers) need to be provided, and the software runs until con￾vergence is achieved using RMS parameter. The software could also be used for forward layered 
elastic analysis for a specifc set of loads, and FWD fles can be directly loaded into the software, 
if required. 
Note that other software (such as Modulus, available from the Texas Transportation Institute at 
http://tti.tamu.edu; n.d.) have different features but similar steps. 
Numerous studies have been conducted on the accuracy of load and defection measurements as 
well as on the refnement of the back-calculation procedures, resulting in continuous improvement 
of both equipment as well as analysis procedures. As a result, the FWD has become the principal 
nondestructive testing tool for pavement engineers. The use of back-calculated moduli using an 
FWD has been recommended for rehabilitation of pavements by the newly developed NCHRP 
1-37A (2004) pavement design guide. Such use is absolutely necessary for determination of moduli 
of subsurface layers as well as for determination of moduli and consistency of new and innovative 
pavement materials. Examples of such use include the testing of full depth reclaimed pavements 
with different types of additives, such as foamed asphalt. Furthermore, the FWD is being used by 
numerous researchers in the determination of pavement layer properties in full-scale test sections 
and for the evaluation of subgrades under unusual conditions as well as the effect of environment 
and new materials on pavement properties. 
One key requirement for the successful application of an FWD is the use of accurate layer 
thickness and condition data. Without the use of any nondestructive tool, the only solution is to 
take cores, in suffcient numbers, such that accurate estimates of layer thickness and conditions 
can be made. However, taking cores defeats the whole idea of nondestructive testing and is not 
an attractive option. Nondestructive instruments such as ground-penetrating radar (GPR) have 
now become very valuable tools for pavement engineers for providing the data necessary for 
using an FWD. 
22.2.2.1 Modeling Thin Layers 
Back-calculation will not be able to give a separate modulus for a thin surface course. If the layer 
is too thin (insensitive), it must be combined with the layer of similar material that lies below it. 
If the modulus of a layer does not infuence the surface defections, one cannot use defections to 
determine the layer modulus. The term “sensitivity” is used to describe the effect of a layer’s modu￾lus on the surface defections. An insensitive layer can have almost any modulus, and it will have 
little effect on the defection. The best approach to use with an insensitive layer is to give it a fxed 
modulus or combine it with an adjacent (similar) layer. 
22.2.2.2 Modeling Subgrades 
The upper portion of a subgrade is affected by weather. It goes through seasonal cycles of freeze— 
thaw and/or wet—dry, and thus its modulus changes over time. Even if the depth is arbitrary, it is 
better to model the upper subgrade as a separate layer. 
22.2.2.3 Modeling Bedrock 
Shallow bedrock (25 ft deep or less) must be included in the pavement model. As discussed earlier, 
use the a/r method to check for shallow bedrock. 
22.2.2.4 Stress-Dependent Materials 
Pavement materials are often modeled as a linear elastic material, for which E = constant. However, 
most pavement materials are stress dependent. They can be stress-hardening (clean gravels) or 
stress-softening (wet, fne grained materials). 
ISTUDYNondestructive Tests 683 
22.2.2.5 Spatial Variations 
Layer thicknesses, depth to water table, and depth to bedrock all vary along the road. Materials will 
also vary along the road and loads and traffc may vary along the road. To take these variations into 
considerations, follow these steps: 
1. Back-calculate each individual test point 
2. Conduct pavement analysis or design at all test points 
3. Put the results in rank order 
4. Then take the 85th percentile result for overlay design or remaining life calculation. 
22.2.2.6 Seasonal Variations 
Temperature and moisture conditions in the pavement vary over time. Also, these conditions can 
vary within a single day. To take seasonal variations into considerations, consider the following: 
1. Back-calculated moduli are valid only for the date and conditions of test 
2. For important projects, test the pavement at two or more times in the year 
3. Use Miner’s hypothesis to account for seasonal variability. 
22.2.2.7 Detection of Voids in PCC Pavements 
FWD data are used to detect voids where pavement layers have no support. To fll voids under a 
PCC pavement, injection holes are drilled into the pavement and a grout of cement, fy ash, and 
water is pumped through the holes. This procedure is referred to as “undersealing.” Before and 
after drilling holes, voids in the pavement are detected using FWD data. The FWD loading plate is 
placed as close as possible to the slab corner, and the LTE to the adjacent joint is measured. If the 
measured defections fall out of a range determined by the state engineer as acceptable, underseal￾ing procedures begin. 
Because voids under PCC-bridge approach slabs contribute to premature cracking, early detec￾tion of these voids is crucial to avoid costly replacement and rehabilitation measures. The Missouri 
DOT recommends that FWD should be used to determine voids under PCC slabs. This recom￾mendation assumes that the FWD and operator are available, undersealing is being considered as a 
preventive maintenance treatment, and one or more of the following conditions are met: 
Long-lane closures for proof-roll testing are not desirable (e.g., at bridge approaches with 
reduced shoulder widths and high-volume routes). 
Fewer personnel than required with proof rolling are available for testing. 
The pavement shoulder is unstable for accurate proof-rolling measurements. 
More clear and quantifable indications of undersealing improvements than proof rolling can 
provide are desired (i.e., AASHTO rapid void detection procedure). 
22.2.2.8 Detection of Nonresilient Pavement Layer Behavior 
Because the FWD has replaced the Benkelman beam as the primary pavement analysis and design 
device, measured layer moduli now include plastic deformations as well as recoverable deformations. 
Mechanistic design practices assume that all layers behave resiliently. In the past, these additional 
plastic deformations were assumed negligible; however, nonresilient behavior may be observed given 
a load of signifcant magnitude. The practice of “16 (FWD weight) drops at four load levels with 
four replicates at each drop height or load level” may result in nonresilient behavior. Such behav￾ior can be detected by statistical tests. Two statistical methods of nonresilient behavior detection 
were tested using FWD tests at Cornell University. Tests were performed from February until May 
2003. No trends were observed through ANOVA (analysis of variance) tests but chi-squared variance 
tests on the center sensor data revealed nonresiliency during the spring—thaw season. ANOVA tests 
ISTUDY684 Pavement Engineering
will detect systematic variations; however, if the deflections are not always generally increasing or 
decreasing for a given load level, the test does not detect when nonresilient behavior is occurring.
22.2.2.9 Evaluation of Experimental Paving Materials
Crushed aggregate, a popular base course for pavements, have become progressively more expensive. 
To save money on base courses, Florida DOT has sponsored recycling concrete aggregate (RCA) 
research. FWD data were used to test various RCA mixes and the results show RCA to be a viable 
base course for roadway pavements. Ultra-thin whitetopping (UTW) was evaluated using FWD data 
in Minnesota. FWD data were collected 1 year after an experimental UTW pavement test section 
was constructed at the Minnesota Road Research test facility. PCC thickness varied from section to 
section; the study’s intent is to determine an ideal PCC thickness. Strain data captured by the FWD 
showed a good bonding condition between the lower bituminous surface and the new PCC wear￾ing course. Although an optimal UTW overlay design is not yet determined, “the dynamic strain 
measurements indicate that there is a better bond between the asphalt and the overlay in the thinner 
sections.” It was also observed that the magnitude of the strains in the thinner sections were more 
dependent on the stiffness of the asphalt than the number of equivalent single axle loads accumulated.
22.2.2.10 Determination of Load Transfer Efficiency for Jointed PCC Pavements
Adjacent JPC slabs should move together when a load is applied to one of them; faulting can result if 
they do not. The degree to which adjacent slabs move together is defined as load transfer efficiency, 
LTE. LTE is calculated from FWD deflections by placing the load cell on one PCC slab and then 
placing a sensor on an adjacent unloaded slab. When the weight is dropped, the measured deflec￾tions are used to calculate LTE with the following equation:

The slab modulus of elasticity in rigid pavement can be back-calculated with the help of the follow￾ing equations (Ioannides, 1990).

where the defections, D are in inches, P is the load in lbs; a is the radius of load plate (usually 6 
inches); and h is the effective slab thickness in inches, k is the dynamic-k value (typically 2 times 
the value obtained from plate bearing tests) 
22.4 LIGHT WEIGHT DEFLECTOMETER (ASTM E 2583) 
The light weight defectometer (LWD) (Figure 22.4) is a single-person-use portable device that 
uses an accelerometer to determine the defection due to a falling weight. The results are given as 
maximum defection, and the bearing capacity modulus is calculated from it. This device can be 
used to estimate the stiffness of the upper layer of the pavement or to compare the stiffness and 
hence determine the effectiveness of compaction. The weight is of 10 kg falling through a height of 
80cm onto a plate of diameter ranging from 140 to 200mm. The peak force is 25 kN, with impulse 
duration of 25–30 ms. 
The modulus is calculated according to the following relation (Siekmeier et al., 2009).

22.5 CONTINUOUS DEFLECTION DEVICE 
A continuous defection device has been defned (SHRP 2 rapid renewal, details at https://nap. 
nationalacademies.org/download/22766 as a “constantly moving defection measuring device 
that can collect data at intervals of approximately 300 mm (1 ft) or smaller using load levels 
typical of truck loading (i.e., 40–50 kN [9–11 kips] per wheel or load assembly).” The list of 
available devices includes Portancemetre, moving FWD, measuring ball, traffc speed defec￾tometer (TSD), rolling dynamic defectometer (RDD), the rolling wheel defectometer (RWD), 
the airfeld rolling weight defectometer (ARWD), the road defection tester (RDT), and the 
image defection measurement device (IDM). 
The principles of defection measurements used in these various devices include the use of 
vibratory load, laser-based devices and image analysis method to measure defection under a 
moving wheel. Factors that were identifed as important for the use of these devices include 
survey speed and safety, repeatability, accuracy, cost, ease of operation, customer service, ease 
of use of data, availability of software for interpretation of the collected data, reliability, size of 
the vehicle, relevance of the collected information, data for structural design software, and past 
experience. 
Only two of the devices mentioned above, the RWD and TSD meet the requirements of load￾ing of loaded heavy vehicles and relatively fast survey speed requirement. The rolling wheel 
defectometer (RWD) is a truck-based system that can be used to measure the defection under 
moving dual tires of an 18-kip single-axle load for primarily fexible pavements. The equipment 
(Figure 22.5) consists of a semitrailer with four laser units in the undercarriage and close to the 
pavement surface. Of the four laser units, three (located forward and outside of the defection basis) 
are used for measuring the unloaded pavement profle, while the fourth one (located between and 
under the dual tires) is used for determination of the defected profle. The defection is measured 
as the difference between the defected and the undefected profle. A reading is taken at every 
0.1 in., and the data are averaged to reduce the random error of measurement. The tractor unit 
contains all of the required data acquisition system, and the equipment can also record digital 
images and videos of the test section during testing as well as GPS coordinates. The test data can 
be used for network-level analysis in pavement management as well as for delineation of segments 
for rehabilitation, and to establish limits of defection for new pavements and load restrictions for 
spring-thaw periods. Since it can measure the defection while moving at highway speeds, there 
is no need for lane closures and traffc control during its operation and as much as 200–300 lane 
miles can be tested in 1 day. 
The TSD uses a rear axle load of 100 kN (22 kips) of an articulated truck. It uses a system in 
which the vertical defection velocity of a pavement under one of the dual wheel assemblies is 
measured by four Doppler lasers at a speed of up to 80 km per hour (50 mph). Defection is calcu￾lated from the defection slope (μm/m) which is obtained by dividing the defection velocity by the 
instantaneous vehicle speed. 
In the near future these devices have been predicted to be used primarily for network level pave￾ment evaluation, specifcally for identifying structurally defcient areas (to be tested further at the 
project level), providing network level pavement condition data needed for pavement management 
systems, and separating structurally defcient sections from non-structurally effcient sections (and 
hence identifying specifc treatments for preservation or maintenance). 
22.6 GEOGAUGE (SOIL STIFFNESS GAUGE) FOR SOIL COMPACTION 
The GeoGauge (Soil Stiffness Gauge; Figure 22.6) can be used for measuring soil layer stiffness 
as part of the soil compaction control process. This handheld equipment works by measuring 
the impedance at the surface of the soil. It measures the stress imparted to the surface and the

resulting surface velocity as a function of time. The GeoGauge imparts very small displace￾ments to the soil (< 1.27 × 10−6 m or < 0.00005 in.) at 25 steady-state frequencies between 100 and 
196 Hz. Stiffness is measured as a ratio of force to displacement and can be used to determine the 
modulus. The stiffness is determined at each frequency, and the average of the 25 is displayed. 
The GeoGauge is supported on the soil by a ring-shaped foot through isolators. Shakers attached 
to the foot measure force and displacement. Moduli can be calculated with the use of Poisson’s 
ratio. The equipment is powered by batteries and can store multiple readings, and the data can 
be downloaded to a computer. The equipment is calibrated by measuring force and displacement 
of a reference mass. The following equations can be used to calculate modulus (Egeo) from the 
measured Geogage stiffness.

22.7 GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR 
The GPR works on the principles of radiating short electromagnetic pulses from an antenna and 
analyzing the amplitude and velocity of the refected waves from pavement layers (Figure 22.7). The 
pavement thickness and density can be computed from these amplitudes and arrival times. The GPR 
can be used as a handheld device for use on short stretches of pavement, but for pavement thickness 
measurement of long stretches of test pavements generally a vehicle-mounted 1 GHz horn antenna 
GPR system is used (Figure 22.7). Data are collected at normal driving speeds, and passes can be 
made out in the wheel paths and centerline of each lane in each direction. The equipment consists 
of an electronic box, an antenna, a tether, and a laptop computer with the software required for data 
acquisition and analyses. The data can then be analyzed to develop continuous thickness profles,

which are very useful for determination of pavement condition (along with other devices such as 
the FWD) for rehabilitation or estimation of remaining life, as well as for segmentation of a project 
for proper consideration of mix design and construction methods for rehabilitation or recycling 
operations. 
22.8 PORTABLE SEISMIC PAVEMENT ANALYZER 
The portable seismic pavement analyzer (PSPA; Figure 22.8) is a rapid nondestructive testing device 
that provides the modulus of the top pavement layer in real time. It is a portable unit that consists of 
a “source,” two “receivers,” and an electronics box and comes with a tether and a laptop computer 
with the software that controls both data acquisition as well as analysis. The analysis procedure uses 
the surface wave energy to determine the variation in modulus with wavelength (strictly speaking, 
surface wave velocity with wavelength). The analysis method implemented in the PSPA is called the 
ultrasonic surface waves (USW) method, which is a simplifed version of the spectral analysis of 
surface waves (SASW) method. Briefy, this method utilizes the surface wave energy to determine 
the variation in modulus with wavelength. For simplicity, the surface wave velocity is converted to 
modulus using mass density and Poisson’s ratio. 
Up to a wavelength equal to the thickness of the top pavement layer, the moduli from the disper￾sion curve are equal to the actual moduli of the layer. As such, the modulus of the topmost layer can 
be directly estimated without a need for back-calculation.

22.9 FREE FREE RESONANT COLUMN TEST 
The basic principle of this test is that the resonant frequency that is developed within a specimen 
of a certain material when it is subjected to an impulse load is dependent on its dimension and 
stiffness. Hence, in this test, a specimen of known dimension is subjected to a tapping by hammer 
(Figure 22.9) ftted with a load cell, and an accelerometer is used to record the resulting signal at 
ISTUDYNondestructive Tests 691 
the other end of the specimen. The amplitude—frequency plot, displayed by a data acquisition sys￾tem, which is connected to both load cell and the accelerometer, is used to determine the resonant 
frequency. The resonant frequency is then used to calculate the modulus, using the mass density 
(ASTM C 215). 
22.10 ULTRASONIC TEST 
In this test (Figure 22.10), a transducer-generated electric pulse is used to cause a mechanical vibra￾tion in one side of a specimen, and a transducer is used to sense the propagating wave at the other 
end of the specimen. The time of travel of the wave through the specimen is measured, and the 
modulus of the material is calculated using the bulk density and Poisson’s ratio.

22.11 MAGNETIC INDUCTION TOMOGRAPHY 
The magnetic induction tomography (MIT)-Scan equipment (Figure 22.11) uses magnetic tomog￾raphy to detect and evaluate metal dowels placed in concrete pavements. The equipment consists 
of fve sensors that emit an electromagnetic pulse and detects the induced magnetic feld in the 
dowels. It is towed on rails across a concrete pavement slab, and both numerical and graphical data 
are output quickly from dedicated software in the attached computer. The device utilizes a number 
of sensors to capture redundant data, as well as fltering techniques to detect both the position and 
orientation of dowels inside the concrete.

22.12 INFRARED DEVICES 
Portable infrared thermometers are often used for spot measurements of mixes or pavement sur￾faces during construction, whereas infrared (IR) cameras (Figure 22.12) are utilized to obtain a 
picture or video of temperature measurements. The instruments utilize noncontact sensors and soft￾ware to capture infrared radiation (700 nm–1 mm) of the electromagnetic spectrum and convert it 
to electronic signal and fnally process it to temperature measurements and/or thermal images or 
videos. The amount of infrared radiation is proportional to the temperature of the body that emits it, 
which makes IR technology very suitable for measuring temperatures in pavements. Its use in pave￾ments has gradually increased since the late nineties—both for evaluation of construction quality 
as well as for detection of problems in existing layers.

22.13 LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING (LIDAR) SYSTEMS 
In the recent years the use of light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems has been increasingly 
signifcantly. The technology, which uses the pulsed laser light, can be applied ether in static/sta￾tionary or mobile mode (through the use of vehicles or aircrafts, helicopters, or drones). The big￾gest advantage of using LIDAR is the ability to safely and quickly collect a vast amount of data 
and rapidly generate 3-D images of areas or objects, which can be utilized for various purposes by 
the transportation agencies. For pavements, the use includes surveys, digital terrain mapping, post￾construction quality control and inspection, and condition assessment. The type of data collected 
through LIDAR systems are generally categorized by accuracy (high, medium, low) and density of 
data (fne, intermediate, and coarse). The technology and its applications continue to evolve, and 
some of the recent applications include its use for measuring pavement smoothness, surface texture, 
cross slopes and curling, and warping in PCC pavements. Guidelines for the use of mobile LIDAR 
systems in transportation applications are provided by the fnal report from NCHRP project, 15–44, 
available at https://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/docs/nchrp15-44_fnalguidelines.pdf.

Economic Analysis and 23 Cost-Saving Concepts 
23.1 ECONOMIC ANALYSIS 
A proper economic analysis should be conducted for every pavement construction project. In order 
to conduct economic analysis, it is necessary to understand some key concepts and the techniques 
that help us to compare alternatives on the basis of economics and have reasonable estimates of dif￾ferent types of costs associated with pavement projects. 
23.1.1 ENGINEERING ECONOMY 
Economic analysis can be conducted at two levels—frst, at the network level to determine the 
feasibility and scheduling of a project and, second, at the project level to achieve maximum 
economy within a specifc selected project by comparing different alternatives. For the second 
case, all of the alternatives must be able to satisfy the project requirements and should be con￾sidered over the same time period. The economic evaluation of the different alternatives must 
consider accurate (as far as possible) estimates of economic variables and costs and benefts 
associated with the pavement. Life cycle cost (LCC) analysis provides a rational method of con￾ducting such economic analysis. 
23.1.2 CONCEPT OF LIFE CYCLE COST 
The life cycle cost means the total cost that is incurred during the complete life cycle of the pave￾ment. This includes construction, maintenance, and rehabilitation costs and considers return from 
salvage, if any. The utility of computing LCC is that it may be more prudent to spend more money to 
build a better pavement initially and spend comparatively less money in maintenance and rehabili￾tation than it is to save money by building a lower quality pavement, which will require more and/ 
or more frequent maintenance and rehabilitation and therefore will require spending signifcantly 
more money in the long run. 
The techniques used for conducting economic analysis to compute LCC vary, and they depend 
on many factors such as the level at which the analysis is being conducted (network or project), the 
applicability of the techniques to the specifc type of project (e.g., public or privately owned), and 
the consideration of the level of acceptance from the decision maker and the public (which, e.g., may 
be more sensitive to initial construction costs). However, all applicable techniques must consider 
future costs and benefts and the differences between the different types of alternative pavement 
types for the specifc project. 
23.1.3 TECHNIQUES 
The different steps involved in LCC analysis are establishing alternatives, determining timings 
of activities, estimating costs, and computing the costs, respectively. Two of the more commonly 
ISTUDY696 Pavement Engineering 
used economic indicators are the net present value (NPV) or net present worth (NPW) and 
equivalent uniform annual cost (EUAC). NPV is the discounted monetary value of expected net 
benefts (i.e., benefts minus costs). In this method, monetary values are assigned to benefts and 
costs, which are discounted using a discount rate to determine their present values (PV), and then 
the PV of the costs is subtracted from the PV of the benefts. NPV is calculated using the follow￾ing formula: 
N ˛ 1 ˆ NPV Initial cost k=1 
where 
˜ °Rehabilitation cost 
i is the discount rate, the percentage fgure representing the time value of money, accounting for 
Interest rate and Infation rate 
Nominal Interest Rate ° Inflatio Discount rate ˜ Real Interest Rate ˜ on
1˛ Inflation
n is the year of expenditure 
The discount factor is defned as follows. 
1 Discount factor ˜ n
˛1° i˝
Note that the discounting (using a discount rate, i) refects the time value of money, and it expresses 
the benefts and costs at different times in terms of a common unit of measurement. It accounts for 
the interest rate (cost of borrowing or value of investing money) and the infation rate (change in 
price levels over time). The real discount rate of 3%–5% has been suggested for use with real dollar 
cost estimates. 
In the EUAC method, the NPV of all discounted costs and benefts is expressed as uniform 
annual payments throughout the analysis period and is useful for situations where budgets are estab￾lished on an annual basis. EUAC is calculated as follows: 
n ˝ i(1 i ° ) ˇ EUAC ˜ NPV ˆ  (23.2) ˙(1° i)
n ˛1˘
where 
NPV is the net present value 
i is the discount rate 
n is the year of expenditure 
The concepts of NPV and EUAC are illustrated in Figure 23.1. 
An example of a deterministic life cycle cost analysis is shown in Example 23.1a. Note that in 
this analysis, Case A has the lowest combined cost (agency and user), whereas Case B has the low￾est agency cost. The decision maker will select either one of the options, depending on its priorities. 
Example 23.1b shows an example case where the life cycle cost increases because of more frequent 
rehabilitation (see Cases B and C, as compared to Case A), due to substandard construction (poor 
in-place density of the surface layer) (See Figure 23.2).

23.1.4 COSTS IN LIFE CYCLE COST ANALYSIS 
The costs include those incurred by the pavement-managing entity (such as a department of trans￾portation) as well as the users, because of the construction or maintenance/rehabilitation work. 
ISTUDY700 Pavement Engineering 
Note that costs that are common to alternatives can be excluded from the LCC analysis. The same 
concepts are applicable for benefts as well. 
The agency costs include those associated with construction, maintenance, and rehabilita￾tion; engineering and administrative costs; as well as traffc control costs and should take into 
account the salvage value at the end of the analysis period. In case the design life of one alternative 
exceeds the other, then the remaining service life (RSL) must be taken into consideration. The user 
costs, which are relatively diffcult to estimate, include those associated with vehicle operation, 
travel time, and accidents. Guidance on evaluating travel time costs can be obtained from a U.S. 
Department of Transportation (USDOT) memorandum from www.dot.gov/sites/dot.dev/fles/docs/ 
vot_guidance_092811c_0.pdf. 
23.1.5 PROBABILISTIC APPROACH 
In the earlier discussions, the values of the outputs (such as NPV) were obtained by using equa￾tions, assuming unique values of the input, and this resulted in specifc values of the output. This 
is the deterministic approach, in which the uncertainty associated with the inputs, such as future 
costs, discount rate, or year of rehabilitation, is not considered, and the values are considered to 
be constants. However, in real life, the input values are not constant—they are variable. In the 
more sophisticated probabilistic method, this variability of input values (such as initial costs and 
discount rate) is considered, and the output is determined as a (normal) distribution (rather than a 
single value) (Figure 23.3). Using a cumulative distribution, one can estimate the different costs 
(corresponding to different percentiles or probability) and also determine which alternative is more 
variable. The method uses a Monte Carlo simulation, which picks random numbers from the dis￾tribution of the input variables, outputs the results also as a random variable, and then sums up all 
the results to provide a distribution of the output parameter. The use of this probabilistic approach 
enables the user to quantify the risk (risk analysis) associated with each option (due to the variability 
of input parameters) and hence make a more informed decision on the basis of risk the agency is 
willing to tolerate. An example of a probabilistic life cycle cost analysis is shown in Example 23.2 
and Figure 23.4. The following points can be observed from the analysis. (1) Alternative B has a 
much wider distribution compared to Alternative A, and hence has a higher variability, and the 
FIGURE 23.3 Input distributions and life cycle cost distributions. 
ISTUDYEconomic Analysis and Cost-Saving Concepts 701 FIGURE 23.4 Example of a probabilistic life cycle cost analysis. 
ISTUDY702 Pavement Engineering 
NPV is more uncertain; (2) There is a 10% probability that the NPV of Alternative B will be less 
than that of Alternative A by $4 million, and there is a 10% probability the NPV of Alternative B 
will be greater than that of Alternative A by $ 1.15 million; (3) The initial agency cost is the most 
signifcant factor affecting the NPV; (4) Alternative B has a greater chance of savings compared to 
Alternative A.

Recent discussions in the pavement industry regarding LCCA have centered around end-of-life 
considerations—how to determine the remaining service life of the pavement and include it in the 
LCCA. The salvage or terminal value is defned as the pavement value that remains at the end of the 
analysis period and is discounted back to its present value as a credit. Note that the salvage value 
has been defned (FHWA, 1998) to be a sum of residual value, which is the net value from recycling 
the pavement plus the remaining service life (RSL). 
°Cost of Last Activity˛*°RSL˛ RSL Value ˜
°Expected Service Life of Last Activity˛
It has been argued (Musselman and West, 2020) that the RSL is currently based solely on the 
last rehabilitation and does not include the remaining service life of the underlying layers. Accurate 
RSL should be determined for the entire pavement structure, which can include a surface layer, 
an underlying asphalt mix layer (binder and/or stabilized base), crushed aggregate base layer and 
subgrade. Such determination of RSL of the underlying layers can be made either through the use 
of the falling weight defectometer (FWD) data (back-calculated structural capacity compared to 
the original design); through the use of estimated layer coeffcients (AASHTO method, on the basis 
of pavement condition); or through reasonable estimation of predicted life expectancy with the 
remaining asphalt mix layer (after milling), the base, and the subgrade (note that base and subgrade 
may not deteriorate over time). An example calculation of RSL of the underlying asphalt mix layer 
is shown in Example 23.3. 
EXAMPLE 23.3 
Consider a pavement structure consisting of 12-inch HMA, for which the last rehabilitation 
consists of milling and replacing the upper 4-inch HMA. The cost of the original design (COD) 
is $350,000, the layer coeffcient of the existing asphalt mix layer (aEX) is 0.34, the layer coef￾fcient of the original design (aOD) is 0.44, the thickness of the existing asphalt mix layer after 
milling (hEX) is 8 inch and the thickness of the original design (hOD) is 12 inch. What is the 
RSL of the underlying asphalt mix pavement structure?

Compared to asphalt pavements PCC pavements typically require signifcant reconstruction at the 
end of the service life (completely removed or new structure built over the failed structure). Note 
that measures such as covering up a cracked PCC pavement with an asphalt mix layer may be an 
economical option in the short term, but very costly in the long term, because of the inevitable 
refective cracking. The argument from the asphalt pavement industry is that when considering 
two alternatives (asphalt and PCC pavement), in the LCCA analysis, the analysis period should 
include the time for the PCC pavement to reach its terminal serviceability. A proper consideration 
of the end-of-life rehabilitation cost and the analysis life are also required for accurate LCCA. In 
the case of asphalt pavements, the typical rehabilitation procedure consists of overlay without or 
with milling (partial or full depth), or full construction. In the case of a PCC pavement, the possible 
options are crack and seat (jointed concrete), break and seat (reinforced concrete), rubblization, 
geosynthetic interlayer, stress absorbing membrane interlayer, crack-resistant asphalt mix layer and 
asphalt mix overlay over PCC with saw and seal over the joints, remove and replace with PCC or 
asphalt mix layer and PCC overlay (West et al., 2020). If the analysis period extends to the end of 
the PCC pavement life, for example, the cost of rubblization and installation of edge drain need to 
be considered in the LCCA. Furthermore, during slab fracturing of PCC or rubblization, costs due 
to the disruptions to traffc and user delays and required work to accommodate grade and elevation 
changes (for example guardrail height, bridge clearance) need to be considered. 
23.1.6 INFORMATION ON LIFE CYCLE COST ANALYSIS FOR PAVEMENTS 
Since the early 1990s, the U.S. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has been actively spon￾soring workshops on LCC and encouraging users to employ LCC analysis to evaluate alternatives 
for different projects. The use of LCC analysis is compulsory for all projects in excess of $25 mil￾lion that have federal involvement in the United States. Simultaneously, the FHWA Offce of Asset 
Management has been offering a very useful collection of tools for conducting LCC analysis—these 
tools include detailed and summary documents and spreadsheet-based software (RealCost), com￾plete with manuals. The materials can be downloaded free from the following website www.fhwa. 
dot.gov/infrastructure/asstmgmt/lcca.cfm. 
Information on discount rates can be obtained from the U.S. Offce of Management and Budget 
(OMB) through its Circular No. A-94 at www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ 
Appendix-C.pdf. 
LCC analysis software can also be obtained from the Asphalt Pavement Alliance (APA) website 
at http://asphaltroads.org/LifeCycleCostAnalysis. 
23.1.7 SOFTWARE FOR RUNNING LIFE CYCLE COST ANALYSIS 
Different software are available for conducting LCC analysis. The process is illustrated with the use 
of two such software—RealCost (an LCC analysis according to the FHWA best practice methods) 
and AirCost (a life cycle analysis tool for airport pavements, available from www.eng.auburn.edu/ 
research/centers/ncat/research/aaptp/). 
For learning the RealCost spreadsheet-based software, the reader is advised to view the manual 
that is downloadable from the FHWA website and the step-by-step instructions given in the Caltrans 
Interim RealCost Manual that can be unzipped from the RealCost package once the software is 
installed. The RealCost software opens up with a “switchboard” on a spreadsheet that allows the 
user to input data into the spreadsheet. The various steps and input details are summarized in 
Figure 23.5. A comprehensive list of design alternatives for pavement projects is provided in the 
Caltrans manual. 
The analysis period needs to be selected on the basis of guidelines that are provided—it depends 
on the alternatives and their design lives. For the selected analysis period, maintenance or rehabili￾tation treatments need to be decided after the initial construction. Typical discount rates vary from 3 
ISTUDYEconomic Analysis and Cost-Saving Concepts 705 
FIGURE 23.5 Steps in the use of RealCost and AirCost software. 
to 5. For each alternative, the maintenance and rehabilitation (M&R) schedule must be established. 
Typical M&R schedules are provided in the Caltrans manual and are decided on the basis of exist￾ing/new pavement type, proposed fnal surface type, pavement design life, climatic region, and 
maintenance service level. A guide to the selection of the proper M&R table is provided in a fow 
chart in the manual. Since the software allows up to 6 rehabilitation activities, interim maintenance 
projects are converted into annualized cost and entered separately in RealCost. 
The costs that are estimated include agency costs (initial, maintenance, rehabilitation cost, and 
RSL value) and user costs (travel time costs and other than routine maintenance vehicle operat￾ing costs that is incurred by the user). Guidance for estimating project support costs is also given. 
Maintenance costs include those required for routine, preventive, and corrective maintenance, 
while rehabilitation cost is the cost for future rehabilitation that is required for a specifc alterna￾tive. A step-by-step procedure for the calculation of rehabilitation cost is given in the guide. The 
reduction of the capacity of the facility and traffc fow leads to the user costs (typical values are 
given). The RSL is defned as the difference between the service life and the analysis period and is 
calculated on the basis of total cost of the last scheduled rehabilitation activity and the percentage 
ISTUDY 
706 Pavement Engineering 
of service life remaining at the end of the analysis period. The LCC is determined with the help 
of the concept of discounting (to compare the money at a common point of time) and, specifcally, 
the PV approach. 
AirCost is also a spreadsheet-based software that consists of four components—life cycle analy￾sis parameter specifcation, scenario alternative analysis, LCC analysis simulation, and viewing 
simulation results. It also provides a “switchboard” interface to input data and run the analysis. The 
general steps are shown in Figure 23.5. Because this software has been developed specifcally for 
airport pavements, certain items in areas such as project details contain airport specifc inputs, for 
example, information on lighting, striping, and grooved pavement area. Other important features 
include the total airport daily revenue and its growth rate for the LCCA parameters. For the analy￾sis variables, option is provided for selecting deterministic or probabilistic—normal, uniform, and 
triangular—approach. A pay item/cost library is inbuilt in the spreadsheet. The data sheet for the 
mainline and other construction/rehabilitation provides the user the option of including the salvage 
value analysis for the project. The fnal results/output can be saved as an Excel fle. 
23.2 COST-SAVING CONCEPTS 
Over the years, cost-saving concepts in pavement design and construction have been developed 
on the bases of economic analysis as well as necessity. Two such concepts are perpetual pavement 
and the recycling of pavement materials. The concept of perpetual pavement is based on economic 
analysis—it provides a better pavement now with higher initial cost, to prevent excessive costs in 
the future. The concept of recycling has grown partly on the basis of necessity and partly on that 
of engineering economics. Periodic shortages of asphalt and ever increasing costs of asphalt and 
construction processes have made pavement agencies recycle more and more pavement materials 
over the years. In fact, recycling is a routine activity for most pavement agencies, and the last few 
decades have seen tremendous improvements in recycling equipment and processes all over the 
world. 
23.2.1 PRINCIPLES OF PERPETUAL PAVEMENTS 
Perpetual pavements refer to full-depth asphalt pavements that are engineered to resist typical dis￾tresses and survive for long periods of time without requiring any major rehabilitation. The basic 
requirements of such a pavement are as follows: 
1. The bottom must have high asphalt content, and the overall thickness should be large 
enough to prevent fatigue cracking (by having a large number of allowable repetitions to 
failure as well as by having a relatively small tensile strain). 
2. The intermediate layer should be durable and stable—requiring strong aggregate structure 
as well as suffcient resistance against moisture damage. 
3. The wearing course must possess suffcient resistance against rutting and wearing failures 
and be impermeable, although, if needed, an open-graded friction course should be used 
to improve driving conditions. 
The concept of design of perpetual pavement is shown in Figure 23.6. 
Over time, a perpetual pavement is expected to have distresses on the surface or within 2–3in. 
of the surface, which can be repaired relatively easily and economically by replacing or improv￾ing the top layer only, for example, through resurfacing or recycling. This is a signifcantly better 
option compared to a conventional pavement, in which fatigue cracks coming up from the bottom 
part would necessitate the replacement of the entire pavement structure that is up to the depth of 
the crack initiation. The time interval of resurfacing of perpetual pavements can be in the range of 
20 years, giving them a relatively longer life of 40years or more (with two resurfacings). 
ISTUDYEconomic Analysis and Cost-Saving Concepts 707 
FIGURE 23.6 Concept of perpetual pavement. 
(Adapted from Newcomb, D.E. et al., Concepts of perpetual pavements in perpetual bituminous pavements, Transportation 
Research Circular, No. 503, Transportation Research Board, National Research Council, Washington, DC, December 
2001). 
The structural and mix design of the asphalt-rich bottom layer (the base, which is in the zone 
of the maximum tensile strain and hence the zone of fatigue crack initiation) can be based on the 
“maximum limiting” (endurance limit) strain of 70 με, whereas that for preventing subgrade rut￾ting can be based on the “maximum limiting” strain of 200 με. The endurance limit for fatigue 
cracking has been explained as a result of a balance between loading and “healing” or recovery of 
damage in asphalt pavements during rest periods between loadings. Note that extensive research 
has been conducted on the determination of the fatigue cracking endurance limit strain of HMA, 
and values ranging from 100 to 250 (for mixes with modifed binders) με have been proposed. 
A shift factor of 10 has been suggested between the laboratory and feld performance. A recent 
NCHRP report can be consulted at http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_rpt_762. 
pdf. Lately, the concept of using a limiting strain distribution rather than a single endurance limit 
has been proposed. 
The materials used for constructing the different layers must be selected carefully, with proper 
consideration of the type(s) of distresses that can be expected in each specifc layer. The foundation 
(subgrade) must be well compacted and have adequate resistance against swelling or frost heaves 
and should be capable of supporting necessary construction equipment. The base should have a 
relatively high content (to give a high density of the layer) of an asphalt whose high-temperature 
grade should be the same as that of the surface layer, while the low-temperature grade could be 
the same as that of the layer above this layer (the intermediate layer). Typically the rich bottom 
base (RBB) is the same as the conventional base mix that is used, with 0.5% additional asphalt 
content. Performance tests should include those for rutting, fatigue, as well as for moisture damage. 
The intermediate layer should contain rut-resistant aggregate structure and an optimum content of 
asphalt of the same high-temperature grade as that of the surface layer and low-temperature grade 
one grade lower than that of the surface layer. For aggregates, either large-size stones or smaller 
stones with stone-on-stone contact can be used. Performance tests should include those for rutting 
and moisture damage. The wearing (surface) layer should be made up of polish-resistant aggregates 
with stone-on-stone structure (gradation) and an optimum amount of asphalt with appropriate (or 
one grade higher) high-temperature and low-temperature grade. This asphalt may contain polymers 
and/or fbers, as required for the mix, to achieve high density, impermeability, and rutting resis￾tance. At a minimum, performance testing for rutting should be conducted. 
Construction of a perpetual pavement should be done using proper equipment and quality con￾trol/assurance techniques. Key factors are the use of volumetric properties to check the quality 
of hot mix asphalt (HMA), sophisticated tools such as laser for detecting (and hence preventing) 
the segregation of HMA, a nuclear gage for assuring proper density, ground-penetrating radar for 
ISTUDY 
708 Pavement Engineering 
ensuring adequate and uniform thickness, and proflometers for smoothness. Continuous access to 
an adequately staffed and equipped quality control laboratory is critical. 
Once the perpetual pavement is constructed, it is necessary to monitor it for distresses, such that 
adequate steps can be taken when the critical type and level of distress are observed. Annual sur￾veys of distress and ride quality are necessary. In general, the resurfacing can consist of the milling 
of 2–4 in. of the surface and replacing it with a similar or slightly better mix. Structural evaluation 
can be triggered by the observation of critical distresses on the surface and can be conducted with 
the use of a falling weight defectometer and ground-penetrating radar (and cores). If necessary, a 
slight increase in thickness can be made during resurfacing. Proper tack coat must be used to ensure 
bonding between the existing pavement and the new wearing layer. 
Detailed information on perpetual pavement can be obtained from the APA webpage at http:// 
asphaltroads.org/PerpetualPavement. Two notable design procedures that utilize the perpetual 
pavement concept are the Illinois (Illinois DOT limiting strain criteria) and the Texas (Flexible 
Pavement System, FPS-21, can be downloaded from http://pavementdesign.tamu.edu/fps21.htm) 
design systems. These systems are based on limiting the maximum tensile strain to 70 με and the 
maximum vertical strain at the top of the subgrade to 200 με. Details of these methods are available 
at Illinois DOT (2010), Thompson and Carpenter (2006) and Walubita and Scullion (2010). The 
Asphalt Pavement Alliance has also developed a software to design perpetual pavements (www. 
driveasphalt.org/resources/perpetual-pavement). 
23.2.2 ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF RECYCLING 
When properly selected, all the different types of recycling methods are usually cheaper than the 
conventional rehabilitation methods, even though the relative savings will depend on the kind of 
recycling technique used. The primary savings in hot and cold mix asphalt pavement recycling 
come from savings in the cost of virgin asphalt cement, whereas the savings in hot in-place recy￾cling come by the elimination of transportation costs and use of very little amount of virgin mate￾rial. The major savings in the case of cold in-place recycling come by eliminating the need for a 
fuel or emission control system, since the process is done at ambient temperature; the elimination of 
transportation costs; and the addition of only a small percentage of virgin asphalt binder. Savings of 
up to 40%, 50%, 55%, and 67% can be achieved by using hot mix recycling, hot in-place recycling, 
cold in-place recycling, and full-depth reclamation, respectively. These savings are achieved when 
one of the recycling methods is used in place of a conventional method or some other recycling 
method. For concrete pavements, existing materials can be rubblized and the layer can be com￾pacted and used as a base for an asphalt pavement, or the existing concrete can be recycled with new 
aggregates for a new concrete pavement. 
In addition to the material and construction cost savings, a signifcant amount of cost savings (in 
terms of user costs) can be realized by the reduced interruptions in traffc fow when compared with 
conventional rehabilitation techniques. Recycling can be used to rejuvenate a pavement or correct 
a mix defciency and conserve material and energy—options not available with the conventional 
paving techniques. A conventional overlay may require upgrading shoulders to maintain a profle, 
raising guard rails to maintain the minimum safety standard, and restricting overlays below bridges 
to maintain underpass height. On the other hand, recycling can effectively be used to maintain the 
highway geometry and thus result in substantial overall savings as well. 
Information on recycling pavements can be obtained from the FHWA’s website at www.fhwa. 
dot.gov/pavement/recycling/.

3. Determine which of the alternatives presented next has the lower life cycle cost. Assume 
that both have the same life of 30 years and the same salvage value. Assume a discount rate 
of 4%. 
Alternative A: initial cost: $15 million; rehabilitation at the 10th and 20th years: each cost 
$4 million.

4. What is the basic concept of perpetual pavement? 
5. Consider two alternatives with equal lives for constructing an asphalt pavement: Option 1 
involves milling and removing the existing 2-in. layer and replacing it with 4 in. of HMA. 
Option 2 uses cold in-place recycling to recycle the top 1.5in. of the existing pavement 
and then overlays it with 2 in. of new HMA. Obtain the costs of milling, recycling, and 
construction of new HMA from your local HMA industry (e.g., an asphalt association such 
as the National Asphalt Pavement Association [NAPA] and/or the Asphalt Recycling and 
Reclaiming Association [ARRA], or the local or state department of transportation), and 
select the best option.

Instrumentation in Asphalt 24 and Concrete Pavement 
Instrumentation provides us with direct pavement response data under loading and different envi￾ronmental conditions that are critical for accurate structural design, calibration of laboratory 
obtained design equations, and prediction of service lives. Response data from instrumentation can 
also help us avoid the destructive effects of overloading and improve materials, construction, and 
quality control practices for optimizing the structural strength of pavements. Figure 24.1 provides 
an overview of typical asphalt and concrete pavement instrumentation. 
24.1 TEMPERATURE 
A thermocouple is generally used for determination of temperature. Its principle of operation is 
based on the fact that the voltage drop across dissimilar metals, which are placed in contact, is 
a function of temperature. There can be different types of thermocouples. For example, in a T 
type, a twisted-stranded-shielded-soldered pair of thermocouple wire (constantan and copper) is 
used (Figure 24.2). The exposed end of the thermocouple is surrounded by copper tubing, which is 
attached to the cable insulation by heat-shrinkable Tefon tubing.

24.2 SOIL MOISTURE CONTENT 
Soil moisture content is measured using the time domain refectometry (TDR) technique, which 
is based on the change in dielectric constant of a material with a change in moisture content. The 
dielectric constant of dry soil can range from 3 to 8 (whereas that of free water is 81). A TDR probe 
is shown in Figure 24.3. This probe (CS615; Campbell Scientifc) has two parallel conducting rods 
held on one end by an epoxy head, containing a bistable multivibrator. A suitable oscillation fre￾quency of the vibrator is used for measurement of dielectric constant and to determine moisture 
content with the help of a data acquisition system. 
24.3 FROST DEPTH 
The depth of frost in soil is determined using the concept of measurement of soil resistivity, 
which differs widely from an unfrozen state (20,000–50,000 Ω normally) to a frozen state (from 
500,000 up to several million ohms). Electrical resistance is measured between the conductors 
mounted along a cylindrical probe. The depth of frost penetration is measured from the resistance 
data collected from adjacent pairs of electrodes down the resistivity probe, noting the depth of 
change in resistivity. Copper rings in PVC rods (Figure 24.4) are generally used for measuring 
resistivity.

24.4 STRAIN IN ASPHALT OR CONCRETE PAVEMENT AND SOIL LAYERS 
The horizontal strain in an asphalt or concrete pavement layer is determined on the basis of change 
in resistance of a body due to its elongation or shortening. The elongation or shortening is caused by 
stresses coming from the traffc load. Two features are important for the proper functioning of the 
strain gages. First, the strain gage must be embedded in material with high fexibility and low stiff￾ness and have suffcient durability against stresses and temperature-fuctuations. Second, the strain 
gage must be securely anchored in the pavement to behave as “part” of the pavement. A Dynatest 
PAST II strain gage is shown in Figure 24.5 as an example. It has a resistance of 120 Ω and a gage 
factor of 2.0 and can endure a temperature range of −30°C to +150°C. The maximum strain it can 
record is 1500 microstrain. For soils, for measuring the vertical strain, generally-linear variable 
deformation transducers (LVDT) such as those with a ± 5 mm range are used. Figure 24.6 shows a 
Dynatest Soil and Stress Deformation Transducer (FTC-1).

FIGURE 24.6 Soil strain gage.

24.5 STRESS IN SOIL LAYERS 
Soil pressure cells are used for the measurement of vertical stress in different types of soils. The 
critical features include sensitivity and resolution of the pressure and resistance to the damaging 
effects of loading and the environment. An example of a pressure cell (Figure 24.7) is the SOPT 
gage from Dynatest, which consists of a liquid-flled cell with an integrated pressure transducer 
within a thin membrane, all consisting of pure titanium. Measurable pressures range from 1.5 to 
120 psi for different size aggregates. 
24.6 DEFLECTION IN LAYERS 
Multidepth defectometer (MDD) (Figure 24.8) is used to determine the defection of the different 
layers in the pavement under traffc loading. The instrument consists of a series of LVDTs at differ￾ent depths stringed on a column that is inserted through a hole in the pavement. The data from the 
device can be acquired and viewed in real time, using sophisticated data acquisition system. 
24.7 DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEMS 
Data are obtained from in-place instruments through the use of appropriate data acquisition sys￾tems. Such data acquisitions systems are controlled by a suitable software (such as LAB VIEW) 
through a computer system and include appropriate modules or devices to interface between the 
instruments and the computer. In many cases, data loggers are used to collect and store data, which 
are then periodically transferred to a computer by using a suitable software and connection cable. 
As required the software can be used to trigger data acquisition on the basis of some other signal, 
such as data coming from a weigh-in-motion (WIM) signal (as a truck passes by the instrumented 
section). The relevant information about the instruments (such as gage factor or calibration con￾stant) is input into the software, which then makes all the relevant computations on the basis of the 
acquired data and stores the data in ASCII or spreadsheet format or even displays data in graphical 
format. Various types of hardware and software are available—an example is shown in Figure 24.9.

25.1 ASPHALT MIXTURES 
Over the years different types of asphalt mixtures have been developed in different parts of the world 
for specialty applications. Some examples of such mixes are presented in the following sections. 
25.1.1 POLYMER-MODIFIED ASPHALT 
Polymers are used in asphalt to increase the range of temperature in which the asphalt mix can be 
used without any distress and to improve bonding of asphalt binder and aggregates. Elastomers and 
plastomers are the two major types of polymers used in asphalt. Block copolymers, random poly￾mer, and natural and synthetic latex are examples of elastomers that are used primarily for decreas￾ing temperature susceptibility, increasing tensile strength at high strain, and improving the cohesion 
and adhesion of asphalt binder. For example, styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) is used for reducing 
the rutting potential of asphalt mixes at high temperatures. Plastomers consist of polyethylene and 
ethylene copolymers and are used primarily to decrease temperature susceptibility, increase modu￾lus, or increase tensile strength. For example, ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) is used for modifying the 
strength, stiffness, and workability of the asphalt mix. Polymers can be either preblended with the 
liquid asphalt binders or blended with the mix at the hot mix asphalt (HMA) plant. A growing use 
of polymer-modifed asphalt is in chip seal coats and other thin-layer maintenance applications, as 
an interlayer for resisting refective cracking, as well as in other specialty mixes such as the open￾graded friction course (OGFC) and stone matrix asphalt (SMA). The use of polymers has become 
almost routine in many applications, and this has necessitated the development of special character￾ization tests (such as the direct tension test and the multiple stress creep and recovery test or MSCR) 
and conditioning tests (such as the modifed rotating German fask or MGRF) for polymer-modifed 
asphalt binders. Two issues that are specifcally important for the good performance of polymer￾modifed asphalt mixes are storage stability and degradation. Storage stability involves the compat￾ibility of the polymer and asphalt binder when stored for long time periods at elevated temperatures, 
and degradation refers to the deterioration of the properties of the polymer due to the presence of 
oxygen at high temperatures. 
Polymer-modifed binders can be produced by physical blending or cross-linking (with a reagent) 
and the important factors are the reagent, dosage of asphalt binder and polymer, use of high shear 
mixer, and proper storage. For the mixing process, critical parameters are time, temperature, speed, 
and shear of the agitation system. Depending on the amount of polymer, three types of polymer￾binder blends can be produced—asphalt continuous phase (< 3% polymer content), two co-contin￾uous phases (3%—7% polymer content), and polymer phase matrix (polymer content > 7%). For a 
specifc type of polymer, the compatibility depends on the polymer content and the properties of 
the base asphalt. Cross-linked blends are favored over physical blends because of superior perfor￾mance and also homogeneity, which leads to storage stability, reduced storage cost (no stirring), 
and reduced problems if there is delay and better control quality. In Europe, the use of polymer￾modifed binder is controlled by EN 14023 specifcation, which is based on consistency (Pen and 
Ring and Ball), cohesion (FD, DTT, and Vialit), durability (RTFOT) and fash point, brittleness 
(Fraass breaking point), strain recovery (elastic recovery), as well as additional tests for plasticity 
range, storage stability, and ER after RTFOT; in the United States, Superpave with MSCR test is 
utilized. The time required for putting a structural overlay for rehabilitation can be signifcantly 
prolonged by using polymer-modifed binder in the surface and base layers.

Asphalt Producers (AMAP) website (http://modifedasphalt.org/). 
25.1.2 ASPHALT RUBBER MIXES 
Each year about 1 billion discarded tires are generated in the world. A typical truck tire consists 
of 34% natural rubber; 11% synthetic polymer; 21% steel; 24% fller material; and 10% antioxi￾dants, antiozonants, and curing compounds of zinc and sulfur oxides (Buttlar and Rath, 2021). 
Left alone, discarded tires would require 80–100 years to decompose (Torretta et al., 2015), and 
landflling with tires continues to become a major problem all over the world. Crumb rubber or 
ground tire rubber (GTR), obtained from recycling discarded vehicle tires (end of life tire, ELT), 
has emerged as an increasingly used asphalt modifer. Started primarily as a way of recycling tires 
and avoiding flling up landfll space, the use of rubber-modifed asphalt (RMA, or asphalt rubber, 
AR; McDonald process, started by Charles McDonald in Arizona; Way et al., [2011]) has grown 
steadily since the early 1990s and continues to grow as different advantages of its use are being 
investigated. 
Generally, GTR rubber is used at about 15%—25% of the total mass of the asphalt binder. ETR is 
shredded and crushed under ambient or low temperature (−80°C, cryogenic process), to a maximum 
size (generally 1 mm) before being added to asphalt binders at an elevated temperature (wet process, 
175–190°C, for 30–60 minutes, referred to as AR) or to aggregates at an HMA plant (dry process, 
added in a drum mixer through RAP feed collar). In the terminal blending wet process (example, 
“Wright Process;” product referred to as rubber modifed binder, RMB), fner size of GTR is used 
(0.6 mm—0.2 mm) with a minimum blending time of 60 minutes. 
GTR use in asphalt binder has been found to be benefcial in several ways. First, it can extend 
the life of the asphalt pavement by increasing the resistance against rutting and cracking (Choubane 
et al., 1999). Second, it can reduce noise level (Donavan and Janello, 2018). Third, it can make the 
pavement stiffer, reduce localized pavement defection, and hence reduce fuel consumption during 
driving (Harvey et al., 2016). Fourth, the use of RMA results in it can increase the smoothness of the 
road. Finally, the surface of the RMA pavement can reduce tire wear (Cooper et al., 2007). 
The reported benefts of using crumb rubber in asphalt mixes include greater fexibility, rougher 
surface texture, greater resistance to aging, and a decrease in draindown potential of asphalt binder. 
These qualities translate to greater fatigue life, better surface friction, improved elasticity, and the 
ability to add a higher amount of asphalt binder to increase flm thickness in mixes such as porous 
friction courses (AR-PFC). The use of RMA or AR continues to grow in chip seals, slurry seals, 
thin overlays, stress absorbing interlayer (to present refective cracking), as well as in structural 
HMA, in the United States as well as in Europe (e.g., in Spain). 
GTR absorbs the lighter fractions of asphalt and swells up, thereby increasing the viscosity of 
the binder, and the stiffness of the mix. This increased stiffness provides enhanced rutting resis￾tance. The dispersed rubber particles also increase the cracking resistance, through various mecha￾nisms—by crack pinning and crack bridging and extending the path through which a crack has 
to travel. Since the GTR is coated with, and hence encased by the asphalt binder, the potential of 
leaching out of any chemical from the tire particles is greatly reduced. To retain its effcacy, it is 
important that when mixing the GTR with asphalt, the material must remain as discrete particles 
(even though of small size) and not chemically disintegrate into different components. 
The initial cost of paving a RMA layer is generally greater than that of a conventional mix— 
however, on a life cycle cost basis, RMA layers are much cheaper because the use of RMA has 
been shown to extend the lives of pavements signifcantly. However, for thin overlays, the cost of 
RMA could be lower than that of polymer modifed asphalt. Additionally, there are indirect benefts 
such as avoiding the landflling of ELTs and creating potential fre and insect breeding hazard. 
Consideration of environmental impacts in life cycle analysis (LCA) studies have also shown the 
positive impact of recycling ELTs (Feraldi et al., 2013). 
ISTUDYSpecialty Applications 719 
 
RMA can be made in regular paving layers, stress absorbing membrane interlayers (SAMI; the 
frst use of RMA), and in gap graded mixes such as porous friction courses (PFC; helps in prevent￾ing draindown of binder) to reduce splash and spray and enhance friction during rainstorms. A 
number of research studies have shown that RMA can work as good as, and costs less than, polymer 
(typically styrene butadiene styrene [SBS]) modifed asphalt mixes. 
The extra cost of the crumb rubber can be offset by the reduced thickness of layers and/or the 
enhanced life of the pavement (Buttlar and Rath, 2019). In many cases, successful use of crumb 
rubber—modifed binder (CRMB) has been made to increase the durability of OGFC and porous 
friction course (PFC) mixes. Generally, CRMB contains a processing agent for achieving better 
particle distribution (trans-polyoctenamer reactive polymer, Vestenamer). In many cases, CRMB 
is accepted in lieu of styrene butadiene styrene (SBS) or styrene butadiene (SB)-modifed binder. 
Proper specifcation regarding feed control, processing agent, particle size and mixing must be 
followed to prevent phase separation and has good storage stability. A wealth of information is 
available from the Rubber Pavement Association website (www.rubberpavements.org), U.S. Tire 
Manufacturers Association (www.ustires.org/), FHWA resource document (www.fhwa.dot.gov/ 
pavement/asphalt/hif20043.pdf), and the recently published State of Knowledge Report on Rubber 
Modifed Asphalt (Buttlar and Rath, 2021, www.ustires.org/sites/default/fles/2021-06/Rubber￾Modifed-Asphalt_5-27-2021-FINAL.pdf). 
From a study of mixes with SBS and GTR and their combination, based on Hamburg rut test 
data, Cantabro mass loss and fracture energy tests at 20°C and −10°C, Howard et al. (2021) con￾cluded that the SBS mixes provided the best performance. They suggested that a combination of 
1–2% SBS and 3–8% GTR would provide a binder with an improvement in the high temperature 
performance. 
25.1.3 STONE MATRIX ASPHALT 
Stone matrix asphalt (SMA) is a binder-rich, aggregate, interlocked, rut-resistant, and durable 
asphalt mix that can be used for high-volume, heavy, as well as slow or standing traffc pavement, 
such as that in industrial loading areas, bus lanes, or container terminal areas. The key feature of 
SMA is its unique gradation, which consists of 20%–30% passing the 4.75 mm sieve material, and 
hence it is of relatively coarse nature. Based on available guidelines, the gradation must be deter￾mined as part of the mix design process, through the use of the concept of “stone-on-stone contact.” 
In principle, it refers to a situation in which the fne aggregates have been reduced to a point where 
the coarse aggregate particles are in contact with each other, resulting in a strong load-bearing 
coarse aggregate skeleton. 
The mix consists of a relatively high amount of mineral fller (percentage passing the 0.075mm 
sieve)—around 10%, for example, compared to around 5% for a typical dense graded mix. The 
high percentage of mineral fller acts as a stabilizer for the asphalt binder, which is also needed at a 
relatively high content (≥ 6% compared to around 5% for a dense graded mix). Fibers are sometimes 
added to the binder to reduce the tendency of draindown of asphalt binder from the mix. 
Because SMA derives its strength primarily from the coarse aggregate skeleton, aggregates from 
only strong parent rock types such as granite, basalt, or quartzite and with fractured faces are gener￾ally used. Also, the design gradation should be strictly followed (or adjusted appropriately) during 
production. Attention to quality control, especially aggregate gradation, is critical for the successful 
production of SMA. Similarly, the temperature of the mix should be carefully adjusted to allow 
good mixing, prevent draindown, and provide adequate temperature for laydown and compaction. 
Design air voids are around 3%, while those in compacted mats should not exceed 5%. Fibers are 
generally added at 0.3%–1.5% by mass of the total mix as stabilizers to prevent draindown of the 
mix. The fbers can be of mineral or cellulose type, and vary in length from 1 to 6mm. For example, 
cellulose fbers are about 1 mm long and 0.05 mm thick. Steps in the mix design of SMA are shown 
in Table 25.1.

6. Compaction of SMA with trial gradation and 6% asphalt content 
7. Determination of voids in coarse aggregate of the mix, VCAmix 
8. Check whether the VCAmix is less than or equal to VCADRC (if not, a different gradation should be tried), and whether 
the voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) is equal to or greater than 17% 
9. Select the design aggregate gradation 
10. Compaction of SMA samples with selected aggregate gradation and trial asphalt contents 
11. Check whether the voids (voids in total mix, VTM) are 3%—4% 
12. Select the design asphalt content 
Mixing and compaction temperatures are dependent on many factors such as type of asphalt, 
but generally the compaction process should be completed before it cools down below 130°C. SMA 
layer thicknesses vary from 2.5 to 5 times the maximum aggregate size and are generally put down 
in 38–50 mm thick layers. If the relatively high amount of mineral fller is not available as aggre￾gates, lime or fy ash could be used through mineral fller feeder, lime feeder, or cold feed bins. Fat 
spots or puddles of asphalt binder can show up on the surface if more than adequate binder has been 
used. In the feld, compaction should start immediately after placement, using a >10-ton static steel￾wheeled roller. A vibratory roller is used for breakdown and rubber-tired roller is not used. Sand can 
be spread on fnished surfaces to reduce skid hazards, if any. 
Once the surface asphalt layer wears off under traffc, the surface texture of SMA provides good 
friction, and also helps in noise reduction, which can be as much as 2.5 dB. SMA costs 20%–30% 
more than dense graded mixes because of factors such as higher quality of materials required, 
larger mixing time, and more intensive quality control. A recent study by Luo et al. (2021) has also 
confrmed the vibration attenuation beneft of SMA, which was found to be positively correlated to 
the coarse aggregate content and the texture depth. 
25.1.4 POROUS FRICTION COURSE 
Porous friction courses (PFC; sometimes referred to as open-graded friction courses) are layers 
made of asphalt mix with a high amount of interconnected air voids that drain out water quickly 
during a rainstorm, reducing glare, splash, and spray and the potential of hydroplaning; improving 
friction; and hence reducing the potential of accidents signifcantly. PFCs also contribute to the 
reduction of tire noise on pavements. 
PFCs consist of very coarse “open/gap” gradation, in which materials passing certain sieve sizes 
are missing. The aggregates should be durable, rough textured, and resistant to abrasion and polish. 
Typically the gradation consists of 5%–15% passing the 2.36mm sieve. The asphalt content can range 
from 5% to 6.5%, with 5% to 7% polymer by weight of the binder and 0.15% to 0.5% fbers by weight 
of the mix. It has a relatively high amount of asphalt binder to provide adequate resistance against 
raveling and premature aging, often modifed with polymer. The mix may also consist of a suitable 
stabilizer, such as fber. Design as well as in-place voids in PFCs can range from 10% to 20%. 
Fibers in the PFC can be added to the pugmill in packaged or loose form in a batch plant or by 
blowing into a drum in a drum plant. Pelletized form fber can be added to the pugmill or drum also. 
ISTUDYSpecialty Applications 721 
 
The mixing time needs to be increased, and storage times in silos should be limited to very short 
times to prevent draindown. 
Haul distances should be limited, and trucks carrying PFCs should have a thorough coating of 
asphalt-release agent on their beds to prevent bonding of mix on the bed as well as tarping to prevent 
cooling down and formation of crust on the surface of the mix. 
To prevent trapping of water, PFC should be placed on impermeable asphalt pavement surfaces 
only. It should preferably not be used on a pavement where the in-place voids are still relatively 
high. Before the placement of the PFC, the underlying pavement can also be sealed using an appro￾priate amount of slow-setting emulsion tack coat (that can penetrate surface voids). The PFC layer 
should be open (daylighted) on the edges of the pavement to allow the free fow of water permeating 
through it. 
Use of a materials transfer device is recommended, and the presence of a hot screed helps in 
preventing pulling of the mat under the paver. Generally a few passes of a static steel-wheeled roller 
are suffcient for properly seating the PFC (there is no need for compaction). Specifc areas such as 
intersections or turning areas, ramps, and curbed areas may not be suitable for PFCs since they can 
ravel and shove or prevent draining. 
Since they are critical in draining water quickly, the voids in the PFCs should be prevented from 
getting flled up with materials such as sand from snow treatments. Also, since they are placed in 
thin lifts, such as those with 1/2 in. to 5/8 in. thickness, snowplows may not be used to prevent lift￾ing and dislodging of the mix. Use of anti-icing chemicals is a better option, and pores clogged with 
debris can be cleaned with high-pressure cleaners. 
25.1.5 WARM MIX ASPHALT 
Warm mix asphalt (WMA) is a concept that involves the use of an additive and/or the modifcation of 
the asphalt mix process to lower the viscosity of asphalt binder and hence enables the production of 
asphalt mixes at a relatively lower temperature (generally, 10°C–75°C, depending on the technology 
used). There are four widely used WMA production processes. The WAM-Foam technology involves 
the use of a two-component binder system called WAM-Foam (warm asphalt mix foam). In this pro￾cess, a soft-foamed binder and hard-foamed binder are added at different stages during plant produc￾tion. In the Aspha-Min process, a synthetic zeolite called Aspha-Min is used during mixing at the 
plant to create a foaming effect in the binder. Sasobit, Fischer-Tropsch paraffn wax, and Asphaltan B, 
a low-molecular-weight esterifed wax, are mixed directly with the asphalt binder, whereas Evotherm 
is a nonproprietary product that includes additives to improve coating and workability. 
In the WAM-Foam process, the mixing is done in two stages. In the frst stage, a soft binder is 
used to provide effective coating of aggregates at a lower temperature (typically 212°F–250°F, or 
100°C–120°C). In the second phase, a harder binder, in the form of a powder, foam, or emulsion, 
is added to bring the grade of the total binder to the level of a binder used for a conventional HMA. 
Aspha-Min is a manufactured synthetic sodium aluminum silicate, better known as zeolite. These 
zeolites contain about 21% water by mass. When the zeolites are added to the aggregates at the 
same time as the binder (around 185°F–360°F, or 85°C–182°C), the water is released, resulting in 
the creation of foamed asphalt, which in turn improves the coating of the aggregates and workabil￾ity of the mix. Zeolites (commonly used amount as 0.3% by mass of the mix) can be added directly 
to the pugmill of a batch plant or through a recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) feed or pneumatic 
feeder in a drum plant. Sasobit is a synthetic paraffn wax that melts around 210°F (99°C) and 
reduces the viscosity of the asphalt binder. This enables the production temperatures to be reduced 
by 18°F–54°F (10°C–30°C). Sasobit is added directly to the asphalt binder at the plant, generally 
at the rate of 1.5%–3.0% by mass of the asphalt binder. Asphaltan B is a mix of wax constituents 
and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons, which also reduces the viscosity of the asphalt. It is 
generally used at 2%–4% by weight of the asphalt binder and can be added directly to the binder 
or during mixing. 
ISTUDY722 Pavement Engineering 
Evotherm is a chemical that is delivered in an emulsion with high asphalt residue. The water from 
this emulsion is given out when it is mixed with hot aggregates. The product is supposed to enable 
the production of HMA at a signifcantly lower temperature, and enhance workability, adhesion, 
and coating of the asphalt mixes. 
The benefts of WMA over conventional HMA are many. Because of the lowering of the produc￾tion temperature, less oxidative aging of the asphalt binder and hence the production of a superior 
asphalt mix can be expected. A lowering of temperature also means savings in fuel (burner) costs, 
as well as lowering of emissions, and hence improvement in air quality. It also means that longer 
haul distances could be used (WMA with lower temperature cools slower than HMA with relatively 
high temperature), and the construction season in many parts of the world that have colder climates 
in winter can be extended. The lower temperature of WMA has proven to be benefcial in paving 
overlays with pavements with sealed cracks and joints—unlike the high temperature in HMA, the 
relatively low temperature did not cause formation of steam in joints or liquefaction of the seal￾ant material and resulting bumps. Contractors also fnd it easier to compact WMA—for example, 
four roller passes instead of eight (used for HMA) could be suffcient. Compaction of joints is also 
found to be easier with WMA. Workers are reported to be in a better state at the end of the day, 
while paving with WMA, since they are exposed to less heat. The use of WMA is also benefcial 
for mixes that require higher than conventional temperatures, greater asphalt content, polymer￾modifed binders and are more sensitive to mix/ambient temperatures, such as open-graded fric￾tion courses (OGFC) and asphalt rubber mixes. Finally, it offers the potential of recycling larger 
amounts of RAP materials. 
As the use of WMA grows in different parts of the world and in the United States, research and 
feld trials keep on generating useful information on this mix, and guidelines for successful use 
of this product are being developed. Important considerations that are specifc to this kind of mix 
are as follows: the use of the proper grade of asphalt binder, the need to ensure that aggregates are 
mostly free of moisture (since they are heated to a lower temperature), the effect of low-viscosity 
binder in early stages of life of the pavement, the use of appropriate lower temperatures for uncon￾ventional mixes, the effect of lower temperature on compaction, and the effect, if any, of the WMA 
additives on the low-temperature properties of the asphalt mixes. Although WMA may need a 
lower amount of asphalt binder to compact (during mix design in the laboratory), current guidelines 
encourage the use of asphalt content as would be used for a conventional HMA. 
Warm Mix Asphalt is rapidly becoming popular all over the world. Conventional HMA is pro￾duced at temperatures of 140°C–160°C, whereas WMA is produced between 100°C and 140°C. The 
potential benefts of WMA include the ability to conduct a number of things (either individually or 
in combination) that are not possible with conventional HMA, as follows: 
1. Compact to required density at low ambient temperature 
2. Compact stiff mixes such as polymer modifed or SMA or those containing high percent￾age of RAP or RAS at typically used temperatures 
3. Haul to greater distance, for cases where plants are not available near the job site 
4. Include higher percentage of RAP at achievable and workable plant temperatures 
5. Improve ride quality by minimizing bumps and cracks over crack sealants, and where 
moisture is present in the underlying areas; under high temperature of conventional HMA 
sealants tend to expand and moisture turns to vapor and causes stress on the overlay 
6. Improve workability of gap graded mixes such as open graded friction courses in areas that 
require hand work 
7. Reduce fuel consumption: average reduction of 23% has been reported; a temperature 
reduction of 28°C has been reported to result in a reduction of fuel usage of 11% 
8. Reduce plant emissions, specifcally important for areas with emission problems or envi￾ronmentally sensitive areas 
9. Improve working conditions for plant and paving crew

11. Better manage baghouse fnes by allowing them to be mixed with water. 
The types of WMA that are currently being used are: 
1. Foaming—water in hot binder turns into steam and expands the binder by 5 to 10 times, which 
improves coating and compaction; this water can be added mechanically (free-water foaming) 
or through a slow release mechanism from water containing zeolites, in which case the expan￾sion will be lower; amount of free water needed is 0.25 gal/ton or about 1 L/ton of mix 
2. Use of organic additives or waxes in binders: Binder viscosity is reduced at temperatures 
above the melting point of these additives or waxes 
3. Use of chemical additives or surfactants: These chemicals increase the lubricity of asphalt 
and helps in better coating 
4. Use of chemical additives and sequential mixing of binder, coarse aggregate, and moist 
fne aggregates: This process improves coating of coarse aggregates with foam from mois￾ture from the fne aggregates and help in encapsulation of fne aggregates in binder 
25.1.5.1 WMA and RAP 
The use of WMA helps in the incorporation of high RAP content in two ways—it aids in compac￾tion and also results in less aging of the asphalt binder. The RAP asphalt is reported to be able to 
blend with the virgin asphalt as long as the production temperature of the mix is higher than the 
high temperature PG grade of the RAP asphalt (checked by extracting from RAP). For example, if 
the PG grade of the extracted asphalt is 94°C, then the production temperature needs to be at least 
higher than 94°C. Another beneft that has been reported is that the reduction of production temper￾ature through the use of WMA leads to an improvement in the low temperature grade, which allows 
the use of a higher percentage of RAP. For example, a reduction in temperature by 28°C leads to an 
increase in low temperature grade by 0.6°C that allows the use of an additional 10% RAP without 
the need for changing the grade of the virgin binder. 
Guidelines are needed for proper adoption of WMA technology, its regular use and mix design. 
These guidelines will result in rational and practical specifcations that are critical for the successful 
use of WMA. A signifcant amount of research has been conducted in the last decade on WMA in 
the United States and elsewhere. Examples of relevant sources of information for Warm Mix Asphalt 
(WMA) are appendix of the AASHTO R 35 Special Mixture Design Considerations and Methods 
for WMA, U.S. NCHRP reports 691, 714 (supplement to report 673, for HMA) 763, 779, 807 and the 
NCHRP projects 9–43, 9–47A, 9–49, and 9–53, and Australian (AUSTRAOADS) report AP-T214–12. 
A review of the results from several studies conducted in the United States and elsewhere shows 
the following suggested guidelines. 
25.1.5.2 Adoption 
1. The defnition of a WMA technology should be based on the use of a maximum tempera￾ture of production of the mix. 
2. The contractor’s WMA design should include the name of the approved WMA technology, 
dosage rate, plant mixing temperature, and laboratory compaction temperature. 
3. During production burner needs to be adjusted such that the fuel is entirely consumed 
inside the combustion zone of the drier and mix should be checked for any traces of 
unburned fuel (in which case production should stop). 
4. Plant discharge temperature should be within 10°C of the temperature specifed in mix 
design. 
5. Addition of WMA additive should be through calibrated and plant control interlocked 
system. 
ISTUDY724 Pavement Engineering 
6. The dosage rate and the name of the additive should be mentioned for each batch loaded 
for the job site. 
7. A well-defned new product approval system on a national or regional basis should be 
adopted. 
8. A well-defned framework for the quantifcation of the benefts of WMA should be devel￾oped and implemented. 
25.1.5.3 Regular Use of WMA 
1. Laboratory mixing and compaction temperature should match feld mixing and compac￾tion temperature. 
2. Coating of aggregates (at the reduced temperature of WMA) should be ensured. 
3. Conformation of the reduced temperature of compaction through the use of laboratory 
compaction should be made. 
4. Reduced aging of binder of WMA, and hence reduced stiffness and rutting potential of 
mixes should be evaluated. 
5. Adequate resistance to moisture damage, in view of the fact that aggregates may retain 
some moisture due to the reduced temperature, should be ensured. 
25.1.5.4 Mix Design 
WMA has been designated as asphalt mix produced at a temperature that is approximately 50°F 
(28°C) lower than production temperature of HMA. The key differences between design of HMA 
and WMA are as follows. 
1. Specifc information that need to be collected with respect to WMA include the process, 
additive type, dosage rate, production and compaction temperature. 
2. There is a recommended limit on the continuously graded high temperature stiffness of 
the recycled binder (should be equal to or lower than the WMA compaction temperature to 
facilitate mixing of new and recycled binder); note that this requirement can limit the use 
of recycled asphalt shingles (RAS) as they have high temperature grades (> 124°C) close 
to compaction temperatures of a number of WMA processes. 
3. The low temperature grade of the asphalt binder could be considered to be improved 
because of the use of lower temperatures for WMA; improvements can range from 0.3°C to 
0.7°C for a production temperature of 250°F (121°C), and this can allow the use of 5–10% 
additional RAP in the mix, based on low temperature grade consideration. 
4. The target binder content can consider a lower absorption. 
5. In the evaluation and refnement of trial mixtures step, an appropriate sample prepare pro￾cess should be adopted for a specifc WMA technology, a short term aging temperature same 
as compaction temperature, and for 2h, is to be used, and the mixing and compaction tem￾perature should be the same as the WMA production and compaction temperatures (which 
could be different for the different WMA processes) and not based on viscosity—tempera￾ture relationship of the binder; and the coating and compatibility of mixes should be checked. 
6. The mass of the WMA additive needs to be calculated for the batch weights. 
7. The different types of WMA processes that need to be considered during the mixing of 
aggregate and binder are additives blended into binder, additives added to the mix, wet 
aggregate mix, and foamed asphalt. 
8. For the additives added to the binder, a low-shear mechanical stirrer with appropriate size 
impeller should be used to blend the additive well into the binder. For foamed asphalt 
mixes, a laboratory scale foamed asphalt plant should be used that is capable of producing 
foamed asphalt for laboratory batches from 20–45 lbs (10–20 kg). The RAP binder contri￾bution, if any, should be considered when calculating the total amount of the additive, as a 
percent of the total binder.

9. The coating of the mix is evaluated on the basis of AASHTO T 195 (Standard Method of 
Test for Determining Degree of Particle Coating of Bituminous-Aggregate Mixtures), with 
loose mixes produced at the planned production temperature. In this method the coarse 
aggregate particles are checked for coating and the recommended criterion is 95% of the 
coarse aggregates should be fully coated. 
10. The compactibility test consists of compacting two specimens at the planned compac￾tion temperature and two specimens 30°C below the planned compaction temperature and 
determining the number of gyrations to reach 8% voids. The recommended criterion is 
that the difference in gyrations between the two temperatures must be less than 25% of the 
number of gyrations required at the planned compaction temperature. 
25.1.5.5 Moisture Susceptibility Concern 
Because of the potential of moisture retention in aggregates due to a lower temperature, moisture 
susceptibility has been a concern for WMA mixes. Studies conducted as part of NCHRP 9–53 have 
resulted in recommendations for users, which include the following. 
1. WMA without sustaining a summer aging before the onset of freeze-thaw or wet and cold 
days in winter should be approached with caution, particularly for extreme climates of 
moisture susceptibility. 
2. The addition of anti-stripping agent compatible with the WMA technology, aggregate, and 
binder will most likely mitigate the potential of moisture susceptibility. 
3. The use of either a relatively high temperatures grade (PG) binder or a relatively low high￾temperature grade PG binder with RAP appears to provide adequate resistance against 
moisture damage with or without anti-stripping agent. 
The overall conclusions and recommendations regarding tests and criteria for evaluation of mois￾ture susceptibility of WMA is summarized in Figure 25.1.

25.1.6 ULTRATHIN WEARING COURSE 
Ultrathin wearing courses are provided on pavements that have adequate structural capacity but 
exhibit surface distress such as loss of skid resistance and surface cracks. Such a wearing course 
is generally laid down with specialized equipment, with materials consisting of polymer-modifed 
asphalt emulsion and a coarse-graded asphalt mix, in a lift thickness ranging from 10 to 20 mm. The 
layer is applied in one pass within a relatively short period of time (20–40m/min), enabling mini￾mum disturbance to traffc. The use of appropriate polymer-modifed emulsion binder allows a good 
bond of the layer with the existing surface and hence helps in avoiding delamination that is common 
in conventional thin lift HMA layers. The thin layer facilitates rapid curing and hence quick open￾ing to traffc. The use of gap graded mix can also result in lowering of traffc noise and reduction 
of splash and spray during rainstorm. Prior to the application of this layer, it is important to seal 
existing cracks, patch distress areas, and also diamond grind concrete surface, if necessary. The 
specialized paver (e.g., Novapaver, manufactured by Midland Machinery Company for Novachip, 
a specialized mix) has a combination tamping bar-vibratory screed that helps in reduction of roller 
effort in compacting the mix. Double steel drum rollers are used specifcally to seat the aggregates 
in the polymer emulsion. Table 25.2 shows mix design information of a project. This type of mix 
has been found to be suitable for high-traffc-volume roads and can be considered as an alternative 
to chip seals, microsurfacing, and OGFC. 
25.2 CONCRETE WHITETOPPING 
Whitetopping refers to the placement of a layer of concrete over existing HMA pavements as a 
rehabilitation operation. The thickness of ultrathin whitetopping ranges from 2 to 4in., and fber￾reinforced concrete is used in such cases. Before the placement of whitetopping, the existing HMA 
surface is textured for providing good bond between the new and old materials. The behavior of a 
pavement with bonded whitetopping is considered to be different from that of other pavements. The 
composite section results in much lower stress in the concrete section and hence allows the use of 
thinner section. Many successful applications have been noted, and research continues on the better 
design concepts of whitetopping layers (NCHRP, 2004). For more information, please see the ACPA 
(www.acpa.org/) and FHWA websites.

25.3 POROUS ASPHALT PAVEMENTS 
Porous asphalt pavements (PAP) (Thelen and Howe, 1978; Jackson, 2003; Kandhal and Mishra, 
2014) is used primarily in low volume roads and parking lots, as well as sidewalks, driveways, bike 
paths, and pavement shoulders to reduce stormwater runoff and improve rainwater infltration in the 
subgrade. The structure (Figure 25.2) of such a pavement consists of uncompacted subgrade, non￾woven geotextile flter layer, a reservoir of 40–75 mm size crushed aggregate layer with 40% voids, 
a (choker) thin layer of clean and smaller size (12.5 mm NMAS) aggregate, and an open graded, 
porous asphalt mix (on the top) with 16–22% voids. This pavement is not recommended for areas 
with sinkholes, and the maximum slope in the case of parking areas is limited to 5%. The thick￾ness of the reservoir layer should be determined on the basis of storm water estimation. For the top 
porous asphalt layer, a minimum thickness of 37.5 mm, 100 mm, and 150 mm are recommended 
for parking lots, residential streets with some trucks, and those with heavy trucks, respectively. The 
mix should be designed for adequate voids for drainage (≥ 16%) and avoid excessive drain￾down (≤ 0.3%). The construction sequence and procedures should ensure that there is no excessive 
compaction of the subgrade (that will result in reduce permeability) and avoid contamination with 
dust or fne particles and damage to the geotextile. Use of tracked paver and static steel roller are 
recommended for the porous asphalt. The fnished pavement should meet the required criterion for 
minimum infltration, such as 250 mm/hour. Finally, to ensure continued effciency in spite of grad￾ual sedimentation, the pavement should be vacuumed or power washed 2–4 times a year, to remove 
sediments and ensure proper infltration capacity. Fitch and Bowers (2018) have reported from a 4 
year review of a porous asphalt pavement in Virginia that although the infltration decreased over 
the years in spite of vacuuming, it was still able to maintain the required infltration rate (10 times 
more), and that the loss in infltration could be due to consolidation especially in areas that had high 
initial air voids. 
FIGURE 25.2 Layers in a porous asphalt pavement. 
ISTUDY728 Pavement Engineering 
25.4 PERVIOUS CONCRETE 
Pervious concrete (Deo and Neithalath, 2011; Nguyen et al., 2014; Yahia and Kabagire, 2014; 
Chandrappa and Biligiri, 2016) aids in reducing stormwater runoff by providing a structure with 
high infltration rate, consisting of a single sized (gap graded) material and an optimal amount of 
cement. The recommended minimum porosity of 15%, and a water-cement ratio between 0.2–0.4 
is generally used. Pavements in areas with below freezing temperatures should consist of aggre￾gates that are durable against freeze-thaw. Adequate cement coating of the aggregates is provided 
through an appropriate mix design which can be based on the absolute volume method, excess 
paste or ratio of paste volume to interparticle voids. Compressive strength, fexural strength, fatigue 
life, abrasion and freeze-thaw resistance are the typical properties that need to be evaluated, and it 
should be noted that strength has been found to decrease by 50% for every 10% increase in porosity, 
which is crucial for transport of water within the pervious concrete (Deo and Neithalath, 2010). For 
typical pervious concrete layers the permeability varies between 0.1 and 2 cm/s, and the strength 
is adequate for supporting low volume traffc. There is a potential of clogging of the upper 25 mm 
layer of the pervious concrete by dust particles, and it can be reduced by providing a high or low pre￾size to particle ratio. The typical cross section of a pervious concrete consists of (from bottom up, 
Figure 25.3) a subgrade, geotextile separator, aggregate base layer, optional upper geotextile layer, 
and a pervious concrete layer. While the installation cost of a pervious concrete can be 15–20% 
higher than conventional PCC, the life cycle cost can be lowered by 30% with respect to conven￾tional pavements with storm water drainage. 
25.5 WASTE PLASTICS IN HOT MIX ASPHALT (HMA) LAYERS 
Millions of tons of plastic continue to be disposed every year, all over the world. The most com￾mon forms of such plastic material are low density polyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene 
(HDPE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). There has been a grow￾ing signifcant interest in the hot mix asphalt (HMA) community to utilize waste in asphalt mixes 
because of their polymeric properties which could enhance the performance of HMA. The main 
concern about utilizing plastic as a binder is its melting pint which can be as high as above 170°C, 
much higher than the common production temperature of HMA. Also, plastic such as PVC, on 
heating can generate harmful exhaust gases such as dioxins. So far LDPE and HDPE have been the 
topics of most plastic recycling in HMA, with over 60% added in the wet process and remaining 
in the dry process (shredded plastic). In the wet process generally low melting point plastics are 
added as in the case of polymer modifers at about 2–8% of the weight of the asphalt binder. In the 
dry process, high melting point plastics are used as mix or binder modifer or as aggregate replace￾ments, or as a combination thereof, by 0.2 to 1% of the weight of the aggregate. In such cases, part 
of the plastic melts and coats the aggregates to provide better properties. The use of plastic has been 
found to result in reduced susceptibility to rutting; however, questions remain regarding fatigue and 
FIGURE 25.3 Pervious concrete. 
ISTUDYSpecialty Applications 729 
 
low temperature property enhancement. Phase separation between recycled plastics and the asphalt 
binder due to incompatibility remains a concern. Such incompatibility could be overcome by the use 
of a stabilizing additive such as EVA. 
For plant operations and construction, adequate modifcations and provisions are necessary to 
provide a proper infrastructure for recycling plastics in HMA. These include providing lines to 
asphalt supply and return lines in the plant, and heavier rollers during construction (due to higher 
stiffness of the mix). For health and safety, the leachability of the plastics during recycling and 
the production of toxic gases during production and construction should be monitored and con￾trolled. Research is needed to address a number of issues before plastics can be regularly recycled 
in HMA on a regular basis. These issues include long term performance, specifcally with respect to 
durability, environmental impact, plant modifcations, feld construction equipment modifcations, 
difference in the impacts from post-industrial recycled (PIR) and post-consumer recycled (PCR) 
plastics, incompatibility between binder and recycled plastics, and weathering of micro and nano 
plastics while milling during subsequent rehabilitation operations. Readers are referred to Willis 
et al. (2020) and Yin et al. (2020) for a comprehensive discussion on the subject and the currently 
ongoing NCHRP 09–66 project, Performance Properties of Laboratory Produced Recycled Plastic 
Modifed (RPM) Asphalt Binders and Mixtures (https://onlinepubs.trb.org/Onlinepubs/nchrp/docs/

Sustainable Pavement 26 Engineering 
26.1 OVERVIEW 
Pavement construction is a major employer everywhere; it is a critical driver of infrastructure 
development, which supports industries, and key to lifeblood of the economy. Therefore, adopt￾ing sustainable pavement engineering practices will be an important step toward the implemen￾tation of the principles of sustainable development. Starting from the Brundtland report in 1987 
(WCED, 1987), which defnes sustainable development as development that meets the needs 
of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs 
various defnitions of sustainability have been proposed. For example, the American Society of 
Civil Engineers (ASCE) defnes sustainability as “a set of environmental, economic and social 
conditions in which all of society has the capacity and opportunity to maintain and improve 
its quality of life indefnitely without degrading the quantity, quality or availability of natural, 
economic, and social resources.” 
The key sustainability dimensions are often illustrated by three circles—social, environmental, 
and economic—where sustainability is achieved in the confuence of them. Broadly interpreted, all 
sustainability defnitions address the issue of attaining a balance between human needs with the 
resources that are crucial in attaining those needs (both now and in the future). Whereas resources 
are easier to consider as fnite and measurable, human needs vary in different geographic locations 
and across time periods. As such, each community, region, organization, or nation needs to defne 
for themselves and in the context of its mission what they mean by “sustainable.” 
For the transportation industry, the balance to be attained will be between human needs for 
safety and mobility with the ability for the natural and economic environment to provide the 
resources necessary to achieve those goals. Narrowing the focus to the construction industry, 
the following principles of sustainability have been suggested: (1) showing concern for people by 
ensuring they live in a healthy, safe, and productive environment built in harmony with nature; 
(2) safeguarding the interests of future generations while at the same time meeting today’s needs; 
(3) evaluating the benefts and costs of the project to society and environment; (4) minimizing 
environmental damage including depletion of natural resources; (5) improving the quality of 
buildings and services and promote social cohesiveness; (6) using technology and expertise to 
seek information leading toward project effciency and effectiveness; and (7) legislating compli￾ance and responsibility. 
Based on the above, a suitable defnition of sustainable construction is as follows. “Sustainable 
construction (SC) refers to the integration of environmental, social and economic considerations 
into construction business strategies and practices. It is the application of the principles of sus￾tainable development to the comprehensive construction cycle from the extraction of raw materi￾als, through the planning, design and construction of buildings and infrastructure, until their fnal 
deconstruction and management of the resultant waste” (Tan et al., 2011). SC will lead to (CIB, 
1999) a healthier built environment and ecosystem, energy conservation, better comfort, waste 
reduction, resource conservation, and better service life prediction. 
Pavement construction requires a signifcant amount of raw materials, mostly from natural 
resources, energy and water. Also, emissions are unavoidable in pavement construction activities. 
Challenges are being faced by the industry in the view of maintaining economic and technological 
advances in spite of population growth and the explosive use of nonrenewable natural resources. 
ISTUDY732 Pavement Engineering 
Many departments of transportation (DOTs) have established their own sustainability goals and 
developed authorizing environments. The goals set by agencies can be different since the economic, 
social, and environmental situation may be very diverse. Zietsman et al. (2011) suggests choos￾ing from the goals of providing safety, basic accessibility, equity/equal mobility, system effciency, 
security, prosperity, economic viability, ecosystem, waste generation, resource consumption, emis￾sions, and air quality. Defning the goals is the easiest part of implementing sustainability policy. 
Evaluating/assessing/rating the progress toward the goals and evaluating sustainability on project-to￾project basis is probably the most diffcult challenge. The results should be tracked so that they can be 
used in further improvement of the sustainability system in a variety of ways (Zietsman et al., 2011). 
For example, the following critical items are needed as part of a sustainable construction program. 
Description—They can help describe the effect of the program or policy 
Evaluation—They can be used to assess progress and diagnose what problems or barriers are 
encountered that need to be addressed 
Accountability—They can be used to set targets for specifc staff or programs and can measure 
how well they are doing in reaching those goals 
Decision-support—They can help inform which approach would support the most sustainable 
outcomes 
Communication—They can be used to explain to partners or the public what the program or 
policy is achieving. 
Much of the existing knowledge in the area of sustainable construction is from building construction 
with a signifcant amount coming from the pavement area in the last decade. However, it must be 
noted that a number of environmental policies were adopted and implemented in practice through 
the mid-nineties prior to the recognition of the concept of sustainability, and they eventually lead 
toward achieving the goal of SC. 
A number of assessment methods have been developed, primarily in the form of life cycle analysis 
(LCA) tools. Such tools contain, in addition to the cost beneft analysis (CBA), analysis on the impact 
on the environment, in the form of indicators. Such indicators may include CO2 emissions, water 
consumed, and energy needed. Keeping in mind that any construction is a symbol of development, 
and the whole process of development rests on the idea of proft/return of investment, the question 
becomes, how do we consider the different indicators? Are they of equal weight or not? Can their 
weight change depending on from whose viewpoint one is looking at the analysis (owner or contrac￾tor, for example)? Of course, a very comprehensive method can solve all the problems. But then arises 
the issue of extent versus depth. If a large number of factors are considered to be as comprehensive 
as possible, then a large quantity of data also needs to be acquired and used to develop and validate 
the models. On the other hand, if gross generalizations are done to satisfy the requirements, then the 
purpose of a comprehensive model is defeated, and the method may not be applicable to specifc situ￾ations or regions with specifc conditions. Therefore, note that the issue of sustainable construction is 
one of complex nature, which should be assessed with a rational approach, which is itself sustainable. 
26.1.1 SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION (SC) 
Kibert (1994) laid down the foundation for SC practice and established SC around resource mini￾mization and reuse, use of renewable and recyclable resources, and minimizing carbon footprint. 
Hill and Bowen (1997) presented the fundamentals and principles, Ofori (1998) frst discussed the 
defciencies; Vanegas and Pearce (2000) presented SC based on resource depletion and degradation, 
impact on built environment and human health; Braungart and McDonough (2002) offered the cra￾dle to cradle defnition; and Pulaski (2004) presented a comprehensive approach toward sustainabil￾ity in construction operation. SC tools and standards were frst developed for buildings. The frst set 
of assessment/rating concepts and tools in the United States were provided by the Green Building 
ISTUDYSustainable Pavement Engineering 733 
System (GBS (USGBC LEED); the origin of these tools can be traced back to United Kingdom’s 
Building Research establishment (BRE) environmental assessment method (BREEAM; BRE, 
2006; BREEAM, 2006). Subsequently other “systems” were developed such as Canada’s Green 
Globe; Japan’s CASBEE; Singapore’s Greenmark; China’s Green Olympics Building Assessment 
System (GOBAS); Australia’s Building greenhouse rating (ABGR); and India’s TERI-GRIHA. 
Although differing in scope, the currently agreed common goals of SC are as follows. 
1. Reduce carbon footprint 
2. Ecology and environmental protection 
3. Healthy indoor and outdoor environment 
4. Water use reduction 
5. Energy use effciency 
6. Eliminating environmentally harmful materials 
7. Improve resource effciency 
8. Conserve resources (land and raw materials) 
Many of the above goals have been incorporated in standards and practices such as national pollu￾tion discharge elimination system (NPDES) compliance standards; avoiding construction on food 
plain and green felds; encouraging the use of public transport and energy effcient vehicles; EPA 
energy star guidelines; recycling of waste; promoting use of regional materials; and ASHRAE 90.1. 
26.1.1.1 Sustainability in Transportation and Pavement Engineering 
Sustainability in transportation cuts across the various divisions and departments that are part of trans￾portation agency. It applies to every stage of decision-making making: planning, design, and implemen￾tation of projects and infrastructure, as well as to the day-to-day operations and maintenance (Zietsman 
et al., 2011). In the United States, there is no federal regulation that explicitly focuses on sustainabil￾ity—rather it is a collaborative process between the government and the industry. The development of 
sustainable practices guidelines is further complicated by the fact that there are many agencies that are 
responsible for transportation infrastructure (Zietsman et al., 2011), such as the U.S. Department of 
Transportation (U.S. DOT), FHWA, Federal Transit Administration (at the national level), state and toll 
authorities (at state level), and metropolitan planning organizations, local public works and transporta￾tion departments, public transit agencies, and local-level toll authorities (at local level). 
Miyatake (1996) mentions that one way to work toward SC is by changing from the conventional 
linear process to a cyclical process. This essentially means a signifcant increase in the recycled materi￾als, renewed and reused resources leading to a signifcant decrease in the consumption of energy and 
resources. Miyatake cites examples from the Japanese construction industry that highlight using envi￾ronmentally friendly materials including recycled materials, developing a construction system that pro￾vides lower carbon dioxide emission and energy consumption, using environmentally clean machinery 
and equipment, minimizing discharge of waste from jobsites, reusing/recycling residual materials, and 
minimizing use of tropical timber plywood. Supporting and accelerating these processes are activities 
that are carried out in technology development sectors: environmental assessment technology, coastal 
water cleanup technology, treatment of contaminated soil and hazardous waste, water purifcation and 
wastewater treatment systems, saline water irrigation systems, environmental monitoring by remote 
sensing technology, underground water simulation, and groundwater dam technology. 
Accordingly, the pavement/road construction industry has placed larger emphasis on energy con￾sumption, emissions and environmental protection. This includes not only reduction of energy use 
and subsequent emissions but also development of new technologies that will incorporate higher 
amounts of recycled pavement materials and by-products of other industries. Enhanced road con￾struction technologies, especially perpetual pavements, quieter pavements, and lower temperature/ 
emission pavement materials will all beneft society, the economy, and the environment and lead the 
way for more sustainable roads. 
ISTUDY734 Pavement Engineering 
The work on developing sustainable pavements frst requires defning what are the sustainability 
requirements. There are several defnitions but Miller and Bahia (2009) suggests “pavement that 
minimizes environmental impacts through the reduction of energy consumption, natural resources 
and associated emissions while meeting all performance conditions and standards.” New and more 
sustainable technologies are being developed in asphalt industry. The most noticeable are the warm 
mix asphalt, recycling, perpetual pavements, and permeable pavements. 
Soderlund (2007) presented a model for sustainability rating system for roadway design. The 
major areas of concerns for impacts of pavement construction activities have been noted as: site 
disturbance, waste material generation, emissions and energy use, and the health of workers. A 
number of sustainable activities were provided, such as reuse of materials/recycling, use of waste/ 
by-products and regional materials, and specifc examples of assessment criteria/credits. A com￾prehensive list of construction related activities/impacts and reduction suggestions was provided, 
for impacts on noise, air and water, and energy use (particulate matter, NOx, SOx and fumes from 
equipment and materials). Different impact reduction strategies were also suggested, such as using 
nontoxic paints, providing diesel particulate flter in equipment, using warm mix asphalt, using ultra 
low sulfur diesel in equipment and reducing engine idling (EPA, 1995; NIOSH, 1997; Kean et al., 
2000IERD, 2006; Gilchrist et al., 2003; EPA, 2004; ICF, 2005; Muleski et al., 2005;2007; WSDOE, 
2006; WSDOT, 2006). Soderlund (2007) also provided information on impacts and reduction strate￾gies for different phases of asphalt and concrete pavement construction. 
In the report on the “Handbook for Considering Practical Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction 
Strategies for Airports” (NASEM, 2011), the following practical greenhouse gas emission reduc￾tion strategies for airports have been mentioned: use WMA in place of hot mix asphalt, recycle and 
reuse construction and demolition materials, implement a construction vehicle idling plan, specify 
low-emission construction vehicles and equipment, and specify energy effcient temporary lighting 
during construction. 
In terms of Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) pavements, research is being carried out to reduce 
the energy content of raw materials and energy during production of concrete, reabsorption of 
greenhouse gases, and the use of renewable materials such as fy ash. 
At the time of writing of this edition, the latest and most comprehensive guidelines on sustain￾able pavements is that from Van Dam et al. (2015), and much of the materials in this chapter will be 
referred to this publications. Readers are encouraged to access this publication, which is available 
free of charge at www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/sustainability/hif15002/hif15002.pdf. 
Research for sustainable concrete pavements at the University of Illinois (Baral et al., 2021, 
https://doi.org/10.36501/0197-9191/21-030) is currently focused on developing PCC with adequate 
early strength gain and appropriate setting time by using non-cement additives such as fy ash. The 
researchers are developing tools which include the isothermal calorimeter, digital foam index, and 
models to evaluate such PCC. 
26.1.1.1.1 Rating System 
Multiple systems have been developed that help rating the sustainability of transportation, 
which use measurable criteria that can be used to rate the effectiveness of the achievements 
toward the defned goals of sustainable practices. A summary of the more important systems 
are as follows. 
INVEST: Infrastructure Voluntary Evaluation Sustainability Tool (INVEST) (FHWA, 2012) was 
developed by the Federal Highway Administration specifcally for evaluation of road project sus￾tainability. It is a web-based tool that is publicly accessible and can be voluntarily used by state 
agencies to evaluate the sustainability of their projects through standard and quantitative measures 
that “help to set sustainability goals, track progress and apply management strategies.” 
LEED: Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) is a certifcation program for 
environmentally friendly, low impact materials and designs for buildings. It evaluates the life 
cycle of building, including design, construction, and operations. This is the most widely known 
ISTUDYSustainable Pavement Engineering 735 
 
sustainability certifcation system in the United States. The system evaluates projects in fve cat￾egories (U.S. Green Building Council): sustainable sites, water effciency, energy and atmosphere, 
materials and resources, and indoor environmental quality. Some aspects of road construction (for 
example, parking lots) are covered in the building evaluation system. 
Greenroads, GreeLITES and GreenPave: Greenroads, GreenLITES and GreenPave use 
similar approach and methods for evaluating sustainability of roadway design, construction, 
and planning. They are all voluntary, but Greenroads is a third-party certifcation system while 
GreenLITES and GreenPAVE are self-assessment tools. They are applicable to all types of proj￾ects including new, reconstructed, and rehabilitated roadways as well as bridges. The rating 
systems assign rating points in different categories and the sum of the points gives total score of 
the project sustainability. Points are awarded to the activities based on their perceived sustain￾ability impact. 
Envision, introduced jointly by ASCE, American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC), 
and the American Public Works Association (APWA) through the Institute for Sustainable 
Infrastructure (ISI; www.sustainableinfrastructure.org/news/index.cfm), is a sustainability rating 
system for engineering projects. The system is supposed to provide a holistic framework for assess￾ment of community, environmental, and economic benefts of a project. The assessment tools pro￾vide a checklist and educational tool; a third party rating verifcation system; scoring system; pre, 
during, and post construction evaluation capability; and optimization tool. 
The list of rating system should also include those developed in the 1970s by the EPA (MOBILE/ 
MOVES), in Europe, such as the frst life cycle inventory model developed by the Swedish National 
Road Administration in the mid-nineties, Road-Res from the Technical University of Denmark in 
2005, CHANGER by the International Road Federation in 2009, and the Project Emission Estimator 
(PE-2) developed by Michigan Technological University/Michigan DOT in 2011. 
26.1.2 LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) 
The concept of LCA has steadily gained importance over the last decade as a criterion for the evalu￾ation of sustainability of a product or a system. LCA has been defned as a structured method that 
quantifes environmental impact over the full life cycle of a system or product, including impacts 
that occur throughout the supply chain (Harvey et al., 2016). LCAs can be utilized for improving 
the production and performance of products or systems, for selection of specifc products as part of 
planning and prioritization, developing appropriate indicators of environmental performance, for 
identifying trade-offs in decision-making regarding specifc products or systems and for identifying 
impacts that might occur over the entire life of the product, and the system that includes the product 
as a result of changes made to a product. 
Starting with procedures developed in the 1960s to analyze air, land, and water emissions from 
solid wastes, LCA has been subsequently applied for evaluation of energy, resource use, and chemi￾cal emissions from consumer products and packaging, and fnally for the development of compre￾hensive and ISO-standardized impact assessment methods. In pavement engineering, LCA has been 
applied on production of materials such as asphalt binder and Portland cement. For example, LCA 
can be applied to determine the total environmental impact of a ton of aggregate throughout its life, 
starting from its production, going through processing, transportation through the different stages 
and use, and to the end of life. The end of life can include recycling, remanufacturing, reuse without 
reprocessing, or recycling into other products. 
LCAs going through the end of life are known as “cradle to grave” analysis while those that do 
not include the use and end of life are known as “cradle to gate” analysis. The model used in LCA 
analysis accounts for the materials and energy used at every stage and calculates the wastes and 
pollution as outputs, which are then used to determine the environmental and social impacts of the 
different stages in the life cycle of the product or the system, and hence to calculate a total impact 
over its life. 
ISTUDY736 Pavement Engineering 
Attempts for standardization of LCA analyses have continued throughout the years and current 
relevant standards include ISO 14040 and 14044 (www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:14040:ed-2:v1:en, 
www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:14044:ed-1:v1:en), although there are signifcant differences in spe￾cifc techniques utilized in the LCA analyses for different applications. However, in general there are 
four phases in LCA: goal and scope defnition, inventory analysis, impact assessment, and interpreta￾tion. For the proper application of LCA, the functional unit in LCA of any product or system needs to 
be clearly defned and measurable—it is a unit for which results of an LCA are reported and compari￾sons of results from several alternatives can be made. A relevant example is one lane-mile of a given 
pavement, including its associated traffc and climate. Other relevant parameters include environmen￾tal impact category, which lists the inputs and outputs such as extraction of materials and energy, emis￾sions to air, water and land and fnal waste, feedstock energy, which represents the heat of combustion 
of a raw material which could be used as a fuel, but not actually used as an energy source in a process 
(example, asphalt binder), and allocation, which represents how the environmental impacts of a spe￾cifc product is connected to another product system (for example, the production and use of RAP). 
The essential features of LCA consists of a defned system with its boundary (geographic and 
temporal), a functional unit and required quality of data, depending on the subject and use of the 
LCA. Recommendations regarding the various features are as follows. 
1. The analysis period (pavement assessment period) should be 1–1.5 times the longest life 
among the compared systems, and should either account for changes in relevant factors 
such as traffc, design and energy sources over this period or should be such that they 
could be assumed to be constant; for examples, equal to the time to the next rehabilitation 
or reconstruction of equal or greater intensity, 50 years for new pavement alternatives and 
20 years for evaluation of rehabilitation strategies. 
2. Data for the life cycle inventory (LCI) include those that fow into a process model for the 
specifc system (such as pavements) and those that fow out; for examples, electricity, fuel 
oil and natural gas and aggregates, binder and water are infows for hot mix asphalt pave￾ments, and the outputs include emissions and waste materials. Guidance for data quality is 
available from ISO; the data can be collected from different sources (public, commercial) 
and modifed for appropriate temporal and geographic corrections, according to the scope 
and goal of the LCA. The source and quality of data and results of sensitivity analysis of 
the data must be reported as part of the LCA. 
3. In the impact assessment phase, the environmental outfows are converted into environ￾mental impacts in terms of impacts on humans, nature and depletion of resources, through 
the use of established assessment methodologies, such as the TRACI (Bare, 2011) or the 
CML (Guinée et al., 2002). 
4. The results of LCA are summarized and discussed, major factors are identifed, and sensi￾tivity analyses results are utilized for making conclusions and decisions. According to ISO 
14044, an LCA for comparing alternatives should be transparent to readers and must have 
review through an independent panel. 
One important and growing use of LCA is the development of environmental product declara￾tion (EPD) (ISO 14025, ISO, 2006c) for major construction materials, such as aggregate, cement, 
asphalt binder, and reinforcing steel. Similar to nutritional labels on packaged food, the EPDs will 
present the key environmental impact data for each material such that different materials could be 
compared. The rules for the LCA and the format of the LCA are defned in a product category rule 
(PCR) document which is developed by all stakeholders through a formal process. The EPD can 
be issued once the LCA and the EPD are verifed by an independent third party and the EPD is 
found to be compliant with the PCR. The latest information regarding EPD for asphalt pavement 
mixes (Mukherjee and Dylla, 2017) can be obtained from www.asphaltpavement.org/programs/ 
napa-programs/emerald-eco-label. 
ISTUDYSustainable Pavement Engineering 737 
For considering the appropriate LCI of a pavement, frst, the different stages of a pavement life￾cycle need to be identifed. These stages are material production, pavement design, construction, 
which includes initial as well as maintenance and rehabilitation related construction), use, and end￾of life stages (example, Figure 26.1). The key constituents of each of these stages are as follows. 
1. The LCI of each material used in pavement construction should be developed in the mate￾rial production stage, on the basis of raw material acquisition, material production from 
raw to product stage, mixing processes and various transportation of the materials at dif￾ferent stages of production, and should consider all foreground and background processes 
(for example, the acquisition from quarry is the background and use of aggregates in HMA 
production is the foreground process). 
2. The construction stage modeling should include considerations of equipment mobilization 
and demobilization, equipment uses on site, transportation of materials from and to the job 
site (includes water), energy used on site, changes to traffc fow, equipment manufactur￾ing, and investments in construction related production facilities. Any exclusion should be 
explicitly stated in the LCA. 
3. The use phase should include considerations of those pavement characteristics that can 
affect vehicles/traffc, safety of users, and the environment. These include roughness, mac￾rotexture and structural response, permeability, albedo, heat capacity, and conductivity. 
4. The end-of-life phase includes considerations of recycling, reuse or disposal, in terms of 
equipment use and fuel consumption, reuse of materials, production of reused material 
(such as RAP from milling). One key factor for consideration is the proper allocation of 
the impact at this stage—for example, does the use of RAP resulting from the end of life 
stage of a pavement impact the old pavement or the new pavement (for which the RAP 
replaces virgin aggregates and binder)? A proper method of allocation should be developed 
such that environmental impact reducing practices are encouraged, credits are not double 
counted or omitted, there is fairness between industries in terms of reality, and there is 
transparency and understanding of the effect of allocation on the results of the LCA. 
There are several available LCA calculation tools that can be used for LCA or LCI assessment of 
road construction or asphalt paving projects, including NAPAs’ greenhouse gas calculator, PaLATE 
and AsPECT, and the newly developed PE-2. Brief descriptions of these tools are as follows. 
PaLATE (Pavement Life-Cycle Assessment Tool for Environmental and Economic Effects) is 
a freely available (www.ce.berkeley.edu/~horvath/palate.html) MS Excel based LCA tool that was 
developed at the University of Berkley. It includes all construction layers or road. Since the formulas 
are opened, it can be modifed by the user according to specifc requirements. The tool takes user 
input for the design, initial construction, maintenance, equipment uses, and costs for a roadway, and 
provides outputs for the life-cycle environmental effects and costs. The information on environmen￾tal pollution is categorized by all the greenhouse gas types. 
AsPECT (Asphalt Pavement Embodied Carbon Tool, www.trl.co.uk/solutions/climate-change-and￾sustainability/asphalt-pavement-embodied-carbon-tool) is a LCA tool developed in the United Kingdom 
for calculation of greenhouse gas emissions of asphalt that is used for construction of highways. The 
program considers all aspects of asphalt constituent materials production, transportation, asphalt pro￾duction, and paving, but it does not include pavement maintenance or end of pavement life activities. 
The user interface has been developed as “black box” and to make the use of it easier there are some 
default values that the users cannot change. For example, there are predefned lifetime expectancies of 
different types of asphalt and to reduce the amount of input data required the asphalt installation energy 
use has been defned as 5% of the total “cradle to gate” energy use. The software also recognizes the 
use of RAP in pavements and accounts that 95% of the asphalt will be recyclable in future. It has a set 
balance of carbon benefts of current recycling and of future recyclability at 60:40 ratio. The tool uses 
CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) measure for reporting environmental impact of GHG.

ISTUDYSustainable Pavement Engineering 739 
The National Asphalt Pavement Association (NAPA) has developed a GHG calculator that esti￾mates the emission from the material generation through the plant production process, whereas 
Michigan Technological University/Michigan DOT has developed a tool for estimation of the emis￾sions during the construction phase, which also includes maintenance/reconstruction activities, 
known as the Project Emissions Estimator, PE-2. 
NAPA’s Greenhouse Gas Calculator, (www.asphaltpavement.org/uploads/documents/ 
Sustainability/GHG_Calculator_Documentation_v5_Final.pdf) is based on the Climate Registry 
(TCR) data and can be used to determine the impact of changes in parameters such as the mix tem￾perature, fuel type, RAP/RAS (recycled asphalt shingles) content, etc., and identify potential carbon 
credits. It is a web-based tool for calculation of greenhouse gas emissions related to asphalt pave￾ment manufacturing. It can be considered as LCI rather than a LCA tool. The software has database 
of predefned typical CO2e values for different production processes and offers report in terms of 
total CO2e. Extra credits are awarded for the use of WMA technologies and for incorporating RAP 
or RAS in the asphalt pavement. The tool was developed specifcally for the United States and 
includes predefned GHG emissions from the energy production based on specifc location. 
The PE-2 (www.construction.mtu.edu/cass_reports/webpage/) is a web-based software that 
allows the calculation of emissions and is based on the EPA method of estimation of emissions 
from traffc. The software consists of two databases of inventory product and process data and ser￾vice/maintenance schedules that are combined with the EPA’s MOVES (Motor Vehicle Emission 
Simulator) model. The emissions inventory was created in this software, and one can estimate the 
emissions from different types of equipment and determine the effect of parameters such as effect 
of delays on emissions. The framework and the applications of PE-2 are described in detail by 
Mukherjee and Cass (2012) and Mukherjee et al. (2013), respectively. 
One critical component of the assessment/rating method is achieving the balance between complete￾ness of coverage and simplicity. This is because in order to capture the broad area of environmental 
issues and impacts a system can consist of too many factors and criteria. While being comprehensive 
and desirable, this also means that the requirement of large amounts of detailed information for input, 
analysis and validation is needed as well. If a too generalized approach is taken to accommodate a 
large number of factors, then it also reduces their effectiveness. Within the framework of sustain￾ability assessment there can exist both qualitative and quantitative data, which needs to be evaluated. 
Quantitative data can be more readily evaluated and scored against (for example x point are awarded 
for CO2 emission levels between y and z), whereas certain qualitative data, related to environmental 
issues are more diffcult to evaluate and may be used for points against their presence or absence 
thereof. Assignment of weightings to different criteria requires careful consideration since it dictates 
the overall score of any assessment (Lee, 2002), and will give very distorted view if an explicit weight￾ing system is not used, which could result in equal weights assigned (Todd et al., 2001). 
The following observations can be made on the use of LCA in general: 
1. Most of LCA case studies focus on evaluating environmental impacts only 
2. Most environmental burdens that were evaluated are global warming potential (GWP), 
acidifcation, and energy consumption. 
3. Other factors are ineffcient land use, water shortage, air pollution, traffc congestion, dete￾rioration of ecological systems, high consumption of energy, and waste management 
4. The most relevant greenhouse emissions selected for evaluation are carbon dioxide (CO2), 
methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), chlorofuorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofuorocar￾bons (HCFCs), and perfuorocarbons (PFCs). 
Huang et al. (2009) provides a description of the development of a LCA model for the road 
industry and presents its application through a case study of a paving project in London’s Heathrow 
airport. They discuss the database development and the possibilities of further development of the 
model. Specifcally, they discuss the assessment in terms of recycling of materials and effect of 
ISTUDY740 Pavement Engineering 
construction on (traffc) vehicle emissions. In a more recent publication, Highfeld (2011) has pro￾vided a summary of comparison of different assessment tools. In terms of construction activities, 
NONROAD, aspect, Changer and PaLate have been noted to be relevant, whereas for rating tools, 
only Greenroads and Ceequal were found to be relevant. 
26.1.3 SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION PRACTICES 
Kibert (1994) outlined the six principles on which SC rests: (1) minimize resource consumption, 
(2) maximize resource reuse, (3) use renewable or recyclable resources, (4) protect the natural envi￾ronment, (5) create a healthy, nontoxic environment, and (6) pursue quality in creating the built 
environment. The methods for achieving SC are indicated to be as procurement, design, innovation, 
people, and better regulation by the HM Government (2008). DTI (2006) presented the following 
key sustainable construction practices, namely: establishing effective construction programs; devel￾oping and supporting well focused and capable public sector clients; designing and decision-making 
based on “whole-life value;” using the appropriate procurement and contracting strategies; work￾ing collaboratively through fully integrated teams; evaluating performance; and embedding project 
learning. Table 26.1 shows a summary of practices and principles of SC.

Van Dam et al. (2015) have defned sustainable pavement system as one that includes the “pavement’s 
ability to: (1) achieve the engineering goals for which it was constructed, (2) preserve and (ideally) 
restore surrounding ecosystems, (3) use fnancial, human, and environmental resources economically, 
and (4) meet basic human needs such as health, safety, equity, employment, comfort, and happiness.” 
The need for measuring sustainability may arise from the need for reporting and accounting in 
response to a mandate from an overseeing or funding authority or to participate in a cap-trade pro￾gram. It can be also needed to develop a decision support system such as that needed in pavement 
management system (PMS) or for the continuous improvement of a process. 
The selection of sustainability measures or actions involve cost beneft analysis, which includes 
risk analysis—the risk of adopting an alternative in favor of another. The concept of sustainability 
for pavements has been defned as an ongoing process by Van Dam et al. (2015; www.fhwa.dot.gov/ 
pavement/sustainability/hif15002/hif15002.pdf) with respect to life cycle, which includes materi￾als, structural design, construction, use, preservation, end of life utilization, and consideration as 
part of larger system and assessment. 
The key areas of pavements with maximum impact on sustainability include reduced energy con￾sumption, reduced GHG emission and noise, improved safety, mobility and aesthetics, and reduced 
construction, preservation, rehabilitation, and vehicle operating costs. Life cycle analysis of mate￾rials and processes should be made to select alternatives that can improve sustainability of pave￾ments. Van Dam et al. (2015) mention that achieving sustainable pavements is an ongoing process 
with trade-offs, and consideration of limitations and prioritizations in the decision-making process, 
particularly because a specifc sustainable feature may go against another—example: If a quieter 
surface does not last as “long” as a longer lasting surface, should there be a quieter pavement surface 
or a longer lasting one? They comment that sustainability should be the highest strategy or goal of an 
organization and the mission and goals of its different components (of which the pavements system 
can be a part) should be aligned and prioritized properly to achieve the desired outcome. For agen￾cies looking to adopt the right sustainability assessment approach, they have recommended the use 
of an existing rating system with a target of achieving credits that are consistent with the strategic 
sustainability goals of the agency. 
Van Dam et al. (2015) has listed the impacts of pavements with respect to sustainability as 
follows: (1) GHG; (2) energy consumption; (3) habitat loss, fragmentation, and change; (4) water 
quality; (5) hydrologic cycle changes; (6) air quality; (7) mobility; (8) access; (9) freight; (10) com￾munity; (11) depletion of non-renewable resources; (12) economic development. 
Four key requirements have been identifed for the successful progress toward sustainability: (1) 
new technology and innovations and their utilization; (2) consideration of use phase of pavements as 
part of a larger system; (3) consideration of context sensitivity of sustainability and its dependence on 
specifc projects, available materials and technology, and economic, environmental, and social goals; 
and (4) proper leadership, partnership between stakeholders, education, focused research strategies, 
and the development and application of assessment tools such as Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). 
The latest LCA benchmarking tool from the FHWA is available at www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/ 
lcatool/. 
26.2.1 SUSTAINABLE ASPHALT OF FLEXIBLE PAVEMENTS 
The key points regarding materials consideration for sustainable asphalt or fexible pavements are 
summarized below. 
• Materials Considerations to Improve Pavement Sustainability 
• Aggregates [recycled, coproduct and waste materials (RCWMs)] 
– RAP 
– Steel furnace slag (SFS) 
– Recycled glass (non-conventional) 
ISTUDY742 Pavement Engineering 
• Strategies for Improving Sustainability 
– Increased use of RCWMs as aggregate for bases and subbases and in asphalt con￾crete mixtures 
– Must carefully consider availability (are RCWMs locally available compared to natu￾ral aggregate), experience (local contracting company experience in using RCWMs), 
and performance (is there appropriate laboratory testing and specifcations for the 
RAP volume specifed) 
– Improve aggregate durability 
• Asphalt Materials and Mixtures 
– Two strategies for reducing the environmental impacts of asphalt mixtures: 
– Increase their performance and therefore increase the time between future main￾tenance and rehabilitation treatments 
– Decrease the negative impact of materials in the mixture by reducing the amount 
of virgin asphalt binder and aggregate through the use of recycled materials such 
as RAP, RAS, and recycled tire rubber by minimizing or eliminating those addi￾tives that may increase the impact of material production (polymers, virgin rubber, 
or chemical WMA additives) and by changing specifcations to permit increased 
use of locally available but lower quality aggregates. 
– Lime and liquid anti-strip are two additives that can reduce the susceptibility of mix￾tures to moisture damage. Lime is typically added at about 1% by weight of mixture, 
whereas liquid anti-strip agents are typically added at about 1% by weight of asphalt 
cement. 
– Warm-Mix Asphalt Technologies 
– WMA being used to increase overall density and lower variability of density 
(improve performance) 
– WMA technologies may be used to allow the mixture to stay workable/com￾pactable at lower temperatures, reduce mixing temperature, facilitate paving in 
cooler weather, or allow longer transportation distances 
– WMA technologies are generally grouped into three families: chemical admix￾tures, chemical foaming agents, and mechanical foaming (most commonly used 
in the United States) 
– Recycling and Asphalt Road Materials 
– Recycled materials should be used for the “highest use,” which would be frst as 
replacement for virgin asphalt and aggregate in new asphalt concrete, followed by 
use in recycled cold mix materials, followed by use as aggregate base or aggregate 
in concrete 
– Aged residual binder will stiffen the new mixture, generally improving rutting 
resistance but potentially increasing the tendency for top-down cracking when 
used in surface mixtures unless it is well managed through specifcations 
– The stiffer, aged residual binder in RAP can help reduce bending and tensile 
strains that contribute to bottom-up cracking when used in thicker layers below 
the surface 
– The amount of blending that actually occurs in asphalt concrete, its effect on the 
mixture properties, and how much of the asphalt in the RAP can be considered as 
replacement of virgin asphalt is a subject of research at this time 
– The average RAP content in asphalt concrete mixtures in the United States in 
2009/10 was about 13% for state DOT mixtures, 15% for other agency mixtures, 
and 18% for commercial and residential paving mixtures 
– Increasing the amount of virgin binder replaced through mobilization of the resid￾ual binder as part of the new binder greatly reduces the environmental impact of 
the mixture 
ISTUDYSustainable Pavement Engineering 743 
– Polyphosphoric acid (PPA) increases the high temperature stiffness of an asphalt 
binder to reduce rutting with only minor effects on the intermediate and low tem￾perature properties 
– Substitutes for Petroleum Asphalt 
– Replacement of petroleum-based asphalt with bio-binders including binders 
derived from corn stover, the non-food portion of corn (Metwally, 2010), swine 
waste (Fini et al., 2013), algae (TRB, 2012), and vegetable oil 
– Land-produced plant biomass is typically 80% cellulose and 20% lignin, and lig￾nin can be a source of polymers for use in asphalt. Fermentation, fast pyrolysis, 
and gasifcation are being evaluated to convert cellulose containing biomass into 
liquid fuels. 
– No LCA publication was found in the literature on any of these bio-binders that 
considers the net life-cycle effects of the materials production, construction, use, and 
end-of-life phases 
– Full-depth reclamation with foamed asphalt (FDR-FA) 
– FDR involves the pulverization of the existing asphalt surface and the recyclable 
(unbound or chemically stabilized aggregate) underlying materials, to a maximum 
depth of 12–18 in. depending on available compaction equipment and subgrade sup￾port, while simultaneously mixing it with a binding material, or less frequently com￾pacting it without stabilization as aggregate base. 
– FDR-FA is created when cold water, along with compressed air, is injected into hot 
asphalt in a specially designed container. This results in a thin-flm, high-volume 
asphalt foam with reduced viscosity and increased coating potential. 
– FDR-FA has sustainability benefts for lower volume roads including: 
– Reduced life-cycle costs due to longer service life 
– Lower environmental impact due to reduced use of virgin aggregates and reduced 
landfll usage 
– Increased structural capacity 
– Reduced use-phase costs through expedited construction and simplified 
staging 
– Use of CRM in Asphalt Binders 
– Rubberized asphalt includes at least 15% recycled tire rubber 
– Accelerated pavement testing has demonstrated that a rubber-modifed asphalt 
mixes on top of a dense graded mix can delay or arrest further propagation of 
bottom up cracks through the rubber modifed mix to the surface 
– Mixtures have higher binder contents and are mixed at temperatures that are 
approximately 18°F to 36°F higher than conventional binders 
– Strategies for Improving Sustainability 
– Reduce amount of virgin asphalt binder and virgin aggregate in asphalt concrete 
by plant recycling 
– Increase percentages of reclaimed asphalt materials and the use of binders modi￾fed with CRM from waste tires 
– Reduce energy needed and emissions from mixing asphalt concrete 
– Use of WMA technologies or changing the fuel used in production (e.g., from 
diesel to natural gas) 
– Extend life of asphalt concrete materials 
– Effective mixture design and a high degree of construction compaction 
– Dense graded asphalt concrete can usually be compacted to 2% air voids 
– Rubber and polymers can be used in mixture designs for specifc applications 
– Reducing the risk of moisture damage in asphalt concrete through additives 
– Reduce need for virgin materials and transportation through in-place recycling 
ISTUDY 
744 Pavement Engineering 
– Develop alternatives to petroleum-based binders 
– Work is underway to develop alternative binders, particularly bio-binders that 
have reduced environmental impacts compared to those derived from petroleum. 
However, the environmental impacts of these materials have not yet been evaluated 
using LCA, nor have their long-term performance capabilities been demonstrated. 
• Future Directions/Emerging Technologies 
• A reduction in material quantities 
• Greater use of RCWMs 
• Greater use of locally available pavement materials 
• Development of alternatives, namely bio-based alternatives 
26.2.2 SUSTAINABLE RIGID OR CONCRETE PAVEMENTS 
The major concern with concrete pavements is the high energy and GHG emission (from calcination 
of calcium carbonate) of the Portland cement production process. The key points regarding materi￾als consideration for sustainable rigid or concrete pavements are summarized below. 
• Reduce the amount of Portland cement used in paving mixtures. 
• Use of improved aggregate gradations 
• Use Portland limestone and blended cements 
• The increased use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) added at the con￾crete plant 
• Reduce water use in concrete production 
• Increase the use of RCWMs and marginal aggregates 
• Improve the durability of paving concrete 
• Reduce non-renewable energy consumption and GHG emissions in cement manufacturing 
• Increase the use of renewable energy (e.g., wind, solar) to generate electricity 
• Use alternative fuels in the kiln (natural gas, waste and biofuels) 
• Dilute the clinker content of the cement that is shipped from the plant 
– Increase the percent of limestone and inorganic processing aids in AASHTO M 85 
Portland cement 
– Increase the production of AASHTO M 240 blended cements containing limestone 
or SCMs (i.e., Type IL, Type IP, Type IS, and Type IT) 
• Reduce Energy Consumption and Emissions in Concrete Production 
• Use renewable energy means (wind, solar) 
• Draw from the electrical power grid and not from on-site generators (which can result 
in emissions and noise generation) 
• Use less Portland cement clinker per cubic yard of concrete 
– Use an optimized aggregate gradation 
– Use blended cements 
– Increase the addition rate of SCMs 
• Reduce Water Use in HCC Production 
• Use good mixture proportioning 
• Use water-reducing admixtures 
• Recycle water used to process (includes washing and maintaining moisture of) aggre￾gates and wash trucks and equipment 
• Increase use of RCWMs and marginal materials as aggregate in concrete 
• Determine methods to mitigate weakness of such aggregates 
• Use appropriate strategy to implement the methods during production 
• Improve the durability of concrete 
• Use a relatively low w/cm, typically in a range of 0.40–0.45 
ISTUDYSustainable Pavement Engineering 745 
 
• Use a high quality SCM in suffcient quantity to reduce permeability and increase long￾term strength 
• Use an effective air-void system comprised of closely spaced, spherical microscopic air 
bubbles 
• Use aggregates that are both physically and chemical stable and will not degrade or 
crack under service conditions 
• Innovations 
• High-volume SCM/Portland limestone cement mixtures 
• Photocatalytic cement (creates a highly refective surface that remains clean while treat￾ing air pollution through a photocatalytic reaction involving nanoparticles of titanium 
dioxide (TiO2) 
• Low carbon and carbon sequestering cementitious systems (Examples: Geopolymers 
[Van Dam, 2010] and alkali-activated fy ash [Hicks et al., 2010]) 
• Strategies for Improving Sustainability 
• Use fbers as reinforcement in thin bonded overlays and reduce the thicknesses of the 
slab 
• Use geosynthetics to expedite construction and/or reduce pavement thickness 
• Use appropriate soil modifers to reduce pavement thickness 
26.2.3 MEASURING SUSTAINABILITY 
The key points regarding measurement of sustainability are summarized below. 
• Measuring Sustainability 
• Performance Assessment 
– Traditional condition and distress ratings (e.g., roughness, rutting, cracking faulting) 
– Composite condition rating systems 
– Pavement structural capacity 
– Material design attributes (e.g., thickness, asphalt content, compressive strength, 
gradation) 
– Mechanisms to compare these attributes to expected or design parameters 
• Life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA) 
– Uses economic analysis to evaluate the total cost of an invest option over an analysis 
period 
– Most prevalent LCCA software tool is the FHWA’s RealCost program (FHWA, 2011) 
• Life-cycle assessment (LCA) 
– Used for analyzing and quantifying the environmental impacts of a product, system, 
or process 
• Rating Systems 
– List of sustainability best practices with an associated common metric 
– Currently, a number of national and international rating systems are available in the 
transportation community 
• Integrating Measurement Systems for a more holistic assessment of sustainability 
26.2.4 PAVEMENT AND REHABILITATION DESIGN TO IMPROVE SUSTAINABILITY 
The key points regarding pavement and rehabilitation design are summarized below. 
• Pavement and rehabilitation design to improve sustainability 
• Mechanistic-empirical (ME) design methods 
ISTUDY746 Pavement Engineering 
– ME design methods offer much greater opportunity to consider alternative materials, 
pavement structures, and construction procedures 
– ME design directly considers key material properties (such as stiffness, fatigue resis￾tance, low-temperature cracking properties, permanent deformation resistance, and 
thermal expansion) and is able to relate those properties directly to pavement perfor￾mance through available response and performance models 
– ME design allows the development of designs even for new materials that have not 
been used before, based on their predicted mechanistic response to traffc loads, 
temperatures, and moisture condition 
– ME design can estimate key asphalt or concrete pavement distresses (such as crack￾ing, rutting, faulting) and roughness (e.g., International Roughness Index [IRI]) 
versus time, which allows the designer to consider alternative trigger levels for main￾tenance and rehabilitation 
– AASHTOWare pavement ME design software 
• Sustainable design strategies 
– Longer life pavement 
– Reduction in the amount of asphalt mixture through the selection of materials 
and construction requirements for better compaction that produce greater bend￾ing resistance than conventional materials 
– Incorporation of higher quantities of RAP combined with stiffer and less visco￾elastic asphalt binders in the middle layer 
– Use of modifed open-graded surfaces to reduce noise, slow stormwater runoff, 
and trap pollutants, and provide a sacrifcial layer for top-down cracking 
– Use of recycled concrete pavement or building waste as the granular base layer 
• Perpetual pavement 
– A fatigue-resistant bottom layer is provided that resists damage under tensile 
strains caused by traffc, and thus stops cracks from forming in the bottom of the 
pavement 
– Increasing the total pavement thickness such that the tensile strain at the bottom 
of the base layer is insignifcant 
– Specifying air voids to between 0% and 3% and slightly increasing the asphalt 
content to achieve this high level of compaction 
– Next layer is designed specifcally to increase the bending stiffness through the 
use of stiffer conventional asphalt and potentially higher RAP contents 
– Third layer from the bottom is designed specifcally to resist surface-initiated dis￾tresses such as top-down cracking, rutting, and low-temperature cracking 
– A fourth layer—typically either a high-quality polymer-or rubber-modifed, open￾graded or gap graded mixture or a 1–2in. SMA—can be placed on top of the rut 
resistant layer and is designed for abrasion resistance and vehicle safety 
– Polymer-modifed asphalt can extend the life of the surface by increasing rutting 
resistance and decreasing susceptibility to top-down cracking. It can also be used 
to decrease refection cracking in an overlay application. 
• Future Directions and Emerging Technologies 
– Improvements in ME design: testing, models, validation 
– Improvements in ME design: reliability 
– Integration of design and environmental impact analyses 
– Development of new materials 
– Consideration of future maintenance and rehabilitation in design 
– Performance-related construction specifcations 
– Better models for smoothness performance 
– Approaches for designing better performing fully permeable pavements 
ISTUDYSustainable Pavement Engineering 747 
 
26.2.5 CONSTRUCTION CONSIDERATIONS 
The considerations for construction are summarized below. 
• Construction Considerations to Improve Pavement Sustainability 
• Strategies to improve sustainability of general pavement construction operations 
– Reduce fuel consumption and emissions 
– Reduce noise 
– Accelerate construction 
– Control runoff, erosion, and sedimentation 
26.2.6 USER PHASE CONSIDERATION 
The user phase considerations are summarized below. 
• Use-phase considerations 
• Vehicle fuel consumption and pavement characteristics 
– Pavements can infuence the fuel effciency of vehicles—and therefore the associated 
GHG and air pollution emissions as well—through mechanisms that together are 
called pavement-related rolling resistance 
– Roughness 
– Macrotexture 
– Structural responsiveness 
– Permeability 
– Albedo, heat capacity, and conductivity 
26.2.7 GUIDELINES FOR MEASURING AND IMPROVING SUSTAINABILITY 
NCHRP report 708 (NCHRP project 8–74, Zietsman et al., 2011, www.trb.org/Publications/ 
Blurbs/166313.aspx) provides guidelines for sustainability performance measurement for transpor￾tation agencies in general. The report provides a framework for sustainability performance mea￾surement (SPM—required to answer the question: What does a transportation agency need to be 
equipped with in order to successfully address sustainability issues through performance measure￾ment), consisting of the following steps: 
Step 1—Understanding sustainability 
Step 2—Developing transportation sustainability goals 
Step 3—Developing objectives 
Step 4—Developing performance measures 
Step 5—Implementing performance measures 
Step 6—Refning the framework and applying feedback. 
The report has recommended the transportation sustainability goals, as shown in Table 26.2. 
With respect to pavements specifcally, the following general strategies have been recommended 
(AASHTO) for improving sustainability. 
1. A life-cycle analysis with a period that is > the typical pavement design life should be 
conducted to evaluate different alternatives. 
2. The life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) should include the anticipated changes in costs, user 
and agency costs, probabilistic methods and the consideration of the more signifcant fac￾tors that affect the overall LCC. 
3. Optimal design that considers sustainable materials and methods should be adopted.

Agencies, Transportation Research Board, Washington DC, 203 p, 2011. 
4. Materials and methods that require less transportation, and has lower carbon footprint and 
energy use should be considered. 
5. Sustainable strategies for maintenance and rehabilitation, including those that cause mini￾mal traffc disruptions, should be considered. 
6. Sustainability factors pertaining to the in-service pavements should be considered. Use of 
pavements that have minimal impact on users (cost, safety) and the environment (sound, 
aesthetics) should be considered. 
7. Complete or maximum utilization/recycling of the pavement at the end of its life should be 
planned. 
In their guidelines on transportation sustainability (www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/guide-sustainable￾transportation-performance-measures), the EPA has suggested 12 performance measures as fol￾lows: Transit accessibility, Bicycle and pedestrian mode share, Vehicle miles traveled per capita, 
Carbon intensity, Mixed land uses, Transportation affordability, Distribution of benefts by income 
group, Land consumption, Bicycle and pedestrian activity and safety, Bicycle and pedestrian level 
of service, Average vehicle occupancy, and Transit productivity. 
Research is also being carried in different parts for the world to harvest energy from pave￾ments—either by capturing the solar energy or by utilizing the defections/vibrations caused by the 
dynamic action of traffc in the pavement. Such energy can be used for powering roadside compo￾nents as well as charging or ensuring communication between vehicles. For an up-to-date state of 
the review, the reader is referred to Vizzari et al., 2021. 
26.3 RESILIENT PAVEMENTS 
Extreme weather events such as hurricanes/cyclones and resultant fooding, are affecting road net￾works and users at an increasing rate—partly because of increase in population and traffc, and the 
ISTUDYSustainable Pavement Engineering 749 
 
 
resultant change in land use and planning, and partly because of an increase in extreme weather 
events due to a changing climate. Extreme weather events are likely to increase in the future (Field 
et al., 2014; Melillo et al., 2014). The effects of extreme weather events on pavements can be in terms 
of loss of lives and in damage of roadways that require a signifcant amount of money and time to 
repair. The above damages can cripple cities and regions and cause a tremendous negative impact 
on the nation’s economy (National Research Council, 2010; PIARC, 2012; Dehghani et al., 2014). 
To minimize such damage, appropriate resilience must be considered and provided for roadway 
pavements. 
Resilience has been defned as the “ability to anticipate, prepare for, and adapt to changing con￾ditions and withstand, respond to, and recover rapidly from disruptions” (FHWA, 2014). Resilience 
consists of a summation of three different capacities: absorptive, adaptive, and restorative (Vugrin 
et al., 2010). For an analytical defnition of resilience, a single metric over a time period as proposed 
by Bocchini et al. (2014) can be utilized. The loss of resilience (RL) is defned as the area above 
the recovery curve of functionality of a pavement as shown in Figure 26.2. Resilience index (R) is 
defned as the ratio of the area under the recovery curve to the value of resilience if the event had 
no effect on functionality (i.e. th). 
Loss of resilience, RL = Area above the quality curve 
Resilience = Area under the quality curve 
(26.1) 
(26.2) 
Note that th can be considered to be 365 days (Nivedya et al., 2018). 
The common climate-related stressors for pavements are the extremes of precipitation, tempera￾ture, and sea level rise (SLR). SLR is expected to cause more frequent fooding of coastal highways. 
Pavements can be designed and constructed in different ways to make them more resilient. These 
techniques include (NAPA, 2021) (1) rapid construction; (2) thickening of pavements/use of perpet￾ual pavements; (3) use of appropriate maintenance layers; (4) use of recycled materials when virgin 
materials are unavailable within a short period of time; (5) use of appropriate maintenance overlays 
to strengthen pavements; (6) use of warm mix asphalt (WMA) to enable cold weather or long haul 
paving immediately after disaster; and (7) use of porous pavements to reduce runoff and food risk. 
The fve key requirements for successful progress toward resilience are (1) evaluation of resil￾ience of road networks; (2) identifcation of adaptation strategies; (3) plan for rapid coordination; 
(4) proper leadership and partnership between stakeholders, education, focused research strategies; 
(5) new technology, innovations, and their utilization. 
FIGURE 26.2 Defnition of resilience (redrawn from Bocchini et al., 2014). 
ISTUDY750 Pavement Engineering 
The use of natural and nature-based features (NNBF), such as dunes, maritime forests, wetlands, 
beaches, and reefs (designed and created by humans), have been found to be effective and sustain￾able ways of reducing the impact of SLR and extreme events, and at the same time, lead to the 
generation of usable landscapes for coastal communities (FHWA, 2018, 2019). In the case of asphalt 
pavements with granular base courses, the loss of resilience due to fooding can be minimized by 
providing a base course with adequate hydraulic conductivity and/or thicker surface layers (Nivedya 
et al., 2018). 
Making roadways resilient to a changing climate is always a costly proposition. Furthermore, 
because of the uncertainty in climate change and the resultant stressors, the level of investment is 
often undecided. To consider this uncertainty, a combined use of system dynamics and the Monte 
Carlo simulation has been used to provide a framework to enable a rational investment for making 
roadways resilient, with the help of pavement structural analysis, cost data and available materials 
(Mallick and Nazarian, 2018). A framework for using real options (RO), which allows time for clari￾fcation of climate change scenarios, to utilize better economic policies towards making resilient 
pavements has been presented by Kottayi et al. (2019).

Environmental Mitigation 27 in Transportation Projects 
27.1 INTRODUCTION 
Transportation projects often lead to adverse impacts on the environment. In an ideal sense, all 
negative impacts to both the natural and built environments would be avoided or minimized with 
creative engineering, excellent design, and exceptional construction techniques. Finding these 
opportunities are often the pursuits of graduate study and academic research. In practical appli￾cations, engineers, planners, and public decision-makers recognize the numerous and signifcant 
benefts arising from transportation improvement or expansion projects, and mitigation activities 
are implemented to offset any unfavorable consequences. 
Good mitigation design considers a holistic evaluation of short and long-term impacts. There is 
no standard method for this process, so this chapter utilizes various U.S. Federal and State regula￾tory requirements to build a framework for identifying, measuring, and monitoring impacts to be 
addressed by mitigation activities. 
27.2 HOW TRANSPORTATION IMPACTS THE ENVIRONMENT 
Transportation projects are often associated with other development projects that expand or improve 
the built environment. The effects may be immediate and within the project site (replacing a natural 
surface with pavement) or longer-term and carried a signifcant distance away from the project loca￾tion (air quality impacts from vehicle emissions). The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 
40 “Protection of the Environment” Section 1508 (revised)1 defnes effects, or impacts, as follows: 
“.  .  . changes to the human environment from the proposed action or alternatives that are reason￾ably foreseeable and have a reasonably close causal relationship to the proposed action or alternatives, 
including those effects that occur at the same time and place as the proposed action or alternatives and 
may include effects that are later in time or farther removed in distance from the proposed action or 
alternatives.” 
This defnition was revised in 2020 from its original defnition in 1978 when the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was frst passed. Although the defnition’s reference to “changes 
in the human environment” could be construed to be narrowly focused on people only, the defni￾tion does also note that “effects include ecological (such as the effects on natural resources and on 
the components, structures, and functioning of affected ecosystems), aesthetic, historic, cultural, 
economic (such as the effects on employment), social, or health effects.” 
Cumulative impacts were formerly defned as “the impact on the environment which results from 
the incremental impact of the [proposed] action when added to other past, present, and reasonably 
foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency (Federal or non-Federal) or person undertakes 
such other actions . . .”2 While this defnition was repealed in 2020, it is still important to consider 
cumulative impacts when planning for and designing transportation infrastructure. 
Table 27.1 lists the types of adverse impacts that might result from transportation projects. This 
table is not an exhaustive list of all possible outcomes but is intended to illustrate potential issues 
that may need to be addressed. Depending upon the locations and magnitude of the project, miti￾gation of some of these impacts may be required by national or local laws and regulations. For

regarding Environmental Justice. 
example, food zones, wetlands, coastal areas, historic districts, habitat areas for endangered or 
threatened species, and other designated places are likely to have more stringent rules for mitiga￾tion. In many cases, mitigation of the broader indirect and cumulative impacts may be considered 
beyond the scope of the transportation improvement project. However, there may be some mitiga￾tion techniques or design strategies that can address more than one impact. As such, this holistic 
view early in the project scoping process can be benefcial. 
27.3 NEPA: A MODEL FOR ASSESSING IMPACTS AND 
DEVELOPING MITIGATION MEASURES 
The U.S. National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) provides an effective model for scoping, 
assessing, and mitigating transportation projects and their impacts. In fact, there are numerous laws 
ISTUDYEnvironmental Mitigation in Transportation Projects 757 
in other nations that are similar in NEPA’s intent and implementation. These include but are not lim￾ited to: Japan (Law No. 81 of 1997); China (Order of the President No. 77, 2003); European Union, 
(Council Directive 2014/52/EU); Germany (Federal Law Gazette I p. 2081, 1997). 
The primary purpose of the U.S. NEPA (Public Law 91–190 [1969]) was to establish 
a review process for federal projects and policies that could impact the environment and/or 
irreversibly use natural resources. All federal agencies must comply, including the Federal 
Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). AASHTO’s Center for 
Environmental Excellence provides an excellent overview of how the NEPA process impacts 
most transportation projects.3 
At the U.S. federal level, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) was created by NEPA to 
draft regulations, oversee the process, and publish annual reports on the national’s environmental 
conditions and processes. The CEQ directs the federal agencies to: 
1. Integrate the NEPA process with other planning at the earliest possible time to ensure that 
planning and decisions refect environmental values, to avoid delays later in the process, 
and to head off potential conficts 
2. Rigorously explore and objectively evaluate all reasonable alternatives 
3. Ensure that environmental information is available to public offcials and citizens before 
decisions are made 
4. Encourage and facilitate public involvement in decisions which affect the quality of the 
human environment (Section 1500.2) 
5. Emphasize interagency cooperation before the environmental impact statement is prepared. 
As illustrated in Figure 27.1, once an action is proposed, the frst step is to coordinate with other 
agencies and analyze the action to determine if the impacts are signifcant. To accomplish this, 
there are essentially three levels of analysis. A categorical exclusion (CE) is an action that has 
been evaluated and defned by a federal agency as not having a signifcant individual or cumu￾lative impact on the environment. For example, administrative activities, bicycle/pedestrian 
facilities, noise barriers, projects included in a State’s highway safety plan, and emergency 
FIGURE 27.1 SEPAs: A basic application of the NEPA model 
ISTUDY758 Pavement Engineering 
FIGURE 27.1 (Continued) 
repairs are considered CEs. If the proposed activity is not a CE, and if coordination and initial 
screening are not suffcient to determine the level of signifcance of the impacts, then an envi￾ronmental analysis (EA) is conducted. The EA may result in a fnding of no signifcant impact 
(FONSI), although mitigation may still be required. Or, the EA may determine that the third 
level of analysis, an environmental impact statement (EIS) is needed to evaluate alternatives 
and mitigation options. 
Many states have legislation that is similar to the NEPA (State Environmental Policy Acts, 
SEPAs). These include California, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New York, North Carolina, South Dakota, 
Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. Many of these have similar goals but may contain 
requirements that are different from that of NEPA. For example, NEPA and many states defne 
applicability based on the project proponent and/or funder. NEPA specifes that federal agen￾cies must comply with its requirements, and many SEPAs designate publicly funded projects 
as those that fall under their jurisdiction. However, some states also require environmental 
review for projects proposed by other parties in cases where a state license needs to be issued. 
Table 27.2 compares a number of these acts and lists websites where additional information can 
be obtained. 
27.4 FRAMING MITIGATION BEST PRACTICES 
Using NEPA and these state laws as models, the following general steps of a process to address 
mitigation can be defned (see Figure 27.2). 
The next few sections discuss these steps in more detail by elaborating on regulatory require￾ments and offering additional methods that are commonly utilized. The Federal Highway 
Administration describes a similar process in “Community Impacts Assessment: A Quick Reference 
for Transportation,” available in print or online.4

27.4.1 PROJECT CONCEPTION 
The need for a transportation improvement is often identifed when there is a failure in the transpor￾tation system, such as traffc congestion, pavement disrepair, or safety defciencies. Transportation 
projects are also commonly conceived in relation to other development activities, such as land sub￾divisions, major retail or industrial development, or natural resource extraction (logging and min￾ing, etc.). The desire for new or expanded roadways, airports, railroads, and other facilities may also 
ISTUDY 
760 Pavement Engineering 
FIGURE 27.2 Steps in the mitigation process. 
result from broader planning activities with the goals of economic development, accommodating 
population growth, or directing future development activities to the most appropriate locations. In 
all of these cases, it is important to explicitly describe the need for the improvement and the purpose 
of the proposed action. 
Being explicit about the improvement goal provides a focus throughout the review process; it 
allows us to keep an open mind about the means to get there. Opportunities to avoid and minimize 
environmental impacts may be missed if there is too much focus on just one particular solution. 
There are numerous stakeholders that have an interest in how the project proceeds, and many of 
them can help minimize negative impacts to the natural environment, other infrastructure, under￾represented populations, and various cultural resources. Identifying and coordinating with as many 
stakeholders as possible at the project conception stage will ultimately allow for a more effcient 
project design and implementation. 
Within this coordinated process, the project proponent(s) can identify applicable regulations and 
determine the level of analysis that will be needed to ensure that impacts are avoided, minimized, or 
appropriately mitigated. Using NEPA’s three levels of analysis as a model, the coordination efforts 
may easily determine that the proposed action is either considered to have low risk to the environ￾ment or that a more robust analysis is needed to address impacts and mitigation. 
27.4.2 IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
Assessing a transportation project’s impacts is an essential step in developing mitigation methods 
and preparing numerous alternatives for consideration. The level of analysis could be somewhat 
cursory or extremely detailed. In some cases, a broad analysis of potential environmental impacts 
can defnitively determine whether potential impacts are signifcant or not. If signifcant impacts are 
anticipated, then a more robust analysis will be needed. 
27.4.2.1 The Environmental Assessment (EA) 
The NEPA regulations (40 CFR Part 1508) defne an “environmental assessment” as “a concise 
public document for which a Federal Agency is responsible that serves to: 
ISTUDYEnvironmental Mitigation in Transportation Projects 761 
1. Briefy provide suffcient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an 
environmental impacts statement or a fnding of no signifcant impact. 
2. Aid an agency’s compliance with the act when no environmental impact statement is 
necessary. 
3. Facilitate preparation of a statement when one is necessary. 
The regulations also stipulate that the contents of an EA shall describe the need for the proposed 
action, alternatives, impacts of the proposed action and its alternatives, as well as a listing of agen￾cies and persons consulted in the development of the EA. Alternatives should always include a “no 
build” scenario, which helps to establish the baseline for impact assessments. Note that the EA does 
not need to develop or select mitigation measures at this stage. It is intended to assess the extent and 
severity of the impacts. If signifcant, then an EIS will be required, and that document will address 
mitigation techniques and comparisons between alternative options. 
In 2008, the Texas Department of Transportation completed an EA to identify the potential 
environmental effects of the design and construction of new connector ramps between Interstate 45 
(I-45) and State Route 197.5 The project was intended to address substandard geometric conditions 
and poor levels of service at and near the existing interchange. For example, the existing inter￾change did not meet current design standards; it was located in a foodplain; and it was infuenced 
by a nearby at-grade railroad crossing. In addition, the proposed improvements would consider 
anticipated increases in truck traffc associated with the nearby Shoal Point Terminal Facility. Four 
alternatives (including the No Build Alternative) were developed and assessed. 
The EA fully considered various direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts—particularly associ￾ated with changes in land use (~11 acres of land converted to highway ROW); water resources (~9 
acres of wetlands converted to highway ROW); and foodplains (almost the entire project area was 
located in a 100-year foodplain). Numerous mitigation measures were suggested, such as: 
• The development of a stormwater management plan 
• The implementation of various stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs), including 
temporary erosion control measures during construction, such as sod, silt fencing, hay bale 
dikes, and vegetative flter strips; and permanent measures, such as replanting vegetative 
flter strips within the existing ditches and native species of grasses, shrubs, or trees as 
needed throughout the rest of the ROW 
• Compensatory mitigation for minimized wetland flling and discharge 
• Flood mitigation techniques. 
The public review process resulted in a number of enhancements to the proposed Build Alternative, 
such as locating the project site in a manner as to minimize noise impacts; elevating a section of the 
proposed roadway structure to minimize wetland and foodplain impacts as well as provide a natu￾ral passageway for wildlife; avoiding converting any property from the Virginia Point Peninsula 
Preserve to roadway ROW; and shielding lighting to avoid adverse effects to wildlife. After consid￾eration of the overall benefts of the proposed project, the EA resulted in a fnding of no signifcant 
impact (FONSI), and a full EIS was not required. 
27.4.2.2 The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) 
If signifcant impacts are anticipated, then NEPA requires the submission of an “Environment 
Impact Statement” (EIS). The EIS is a detailed statement that describes the impacts of the proposed 
activities and its alternatives. It should contain the following: 
1. A listing of all anticipated environmental impacts 
2. Unavoidable adverse impacts of the proposed activity, if any 
3. Various alternatives resulting in varying degrees of environmental impacts 
ISTUDY762 Pavement Engineering 
4. Relationship between local short-term use of the environment and the maintenance and 
enhancement of long-term productivity 
5. Irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources in the proposed activity, if any 
The EIS formally begins with the Notice of Intent (NOI) being published in the Federal Register. 
The NOI not only informs the public that an EIS will be prepared for a particular project, it also 
should outline the proposed action and any alternatives; describe the scoping process, including 
information about scoping meetings; and inform the public about who should be contacted with 
questions. As defned by 40 CFR Sec. 1508.25, the project scope should include the range of 
actions, alternatives, and impacts to be considered in the EIS. Scoping is based on a start and end 
time of analysis, the extent of the physical area for the evaluation of impacts, the level of action 
defnition, meaningfulness to decision-making, availability of information, and the regulatory 
focus of the EIS. 
Major sections of the draft EIS include purpose and need; alternatives; affected environment; 
environmental consequences; comments and coordination; and a list of preparers. The Federal 
Highway Administration published a Technical Advisory (T6640.8A)6 to provide guidance on the 
preparation of an EIS. The Advisory provides specifcation on both format and content. Some of the 
prominent items are summarized here. 
The Purpose and Need Statement is a critical piece of writing in the EIS. The problem that 
the action is intending to address needs to be clearly and effectively described. This will drive the 
development of alternatives as well as provide a basis for discussing the no build scenario. FHWA 
encourages the use of visuals (charts, maps, photographs, tables, etc.) to make this description effec￾tive and easy to read by members of the public. 
The discussion of Alternatives needs to describe the preferred alternative, the no build sce￾nario, and a range of other options. FHWA recommends consideration of various build alternatives, 
Transportation Systems Management (TSM) options as well as mass transit in urban areas. 
The Affected Environment describes the area of impact of the proposed project. Data and infor￾mation that provide a broad context should be included, including adopted land use, transportation, 
or other plans of local jurisdictions. 
The Environmental Consequences section will detail the various impacts of the proposed alter￾natives within the affected environment as well as describe appropriate mitigation measures. FHWA 
suggest two options for organizing this section: (1) discuss impacts and mitigation separately for 
each alternative, or (2) discuss the impacts in turn and describe which alternatives are generating 
these impacts and how they may be mitigated. Trend analysis is typically conducted to estimate 
cause-and-effect relationships between the impact and the ecosystems. For any project, the area’s 
potential for growth and forces of change are also considered. 
EPA maintains a searchable database7 of environmental impact statements on their website. 
Other EIS samples can be obtained from the Northwestern University Transportation Library8 and 
on microfche at the EPA Headquarters Repository—accessible through many libraries’ interlibrary 
loan program. 
An international example from China9 assessed the Xi’an Urban Transport Project; a proposed 
development of a renewed urban transport system, including construction of additional relief 
lanes, facilities for CNG refueling, maintenance equipment, and much more. The assessment 
studied impacts to land surfaces, air, water, vegetation, noise, land acquisition and resettlement, 
as well as social, economic, historic and cultural impacts. Mitigation measures were abundant, 
and a detailed monitoring plan was developed for the operation period following construction. 
The EIA concluded that the social and economic benefts were substantial—and would offset the 
unavoidable negative impacts of the proposed project. In particular, improvements to air quality, 
reduction in noise, enhanced safety, and overall mobility improvements were noted to justify the 
effects of the project. 
ISTUDYEnvironmental Mitigation in Transportation Projects 763 
27.4.2.3 SEPA Impact Assessment Examples 
Many states similarly require impact assessments as a screening measure to determine whether a 
full alternatives analysis will be necessary. The Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA) 
stipulates that all projects must be compared to a series of quantifable review thresholds,10 which 
will determine what level of MEPA review is required, if at all. The comparison to these thresh￾olds may result in fnding that no MEPA review is required, that an Environmental Notifcation 
Form (ENF) and some MEPA review is required, or that an ENF and a mandatory Environmental 
Impact Report (EIR) is necessary. For example, if a proposed project is expected to alter designated 
signifcant habitat or more than 2 acres of priority habitat, then an ENF and MEPA review will be 
required. Other thresholds defne limits for direct alteration of land, creation of impervious sur￾faces, water withdrawals, energy use, and many others. 
Other general methods for determining the extent of environmental impacts range from simple 
checklists to more comprehensive activities utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The 
State of Washington’s Department of Ecology provides a comprehensive checklist11 for initial deter￾mination of environmental impact. It assesses 16 environmental components, including earth, air, 
water, plants, animals, energy and natural resources, environmental health, land and shoreline use, 
housing, aesthetics, light and glare, recreation, historical and cultural preservation, transportation, 
public services, and utilities. 
27.4.3 ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS 
The best way to avoid, minimize, or mitigate the impacts of transportation projects is to consider 
a variety of alternative approaches and designs that can meet the identifed need. The impacts 
and potential mitigation measures for each alternative can be developed, and a comparative analy￾sis between them can be conducted. In this manner, the least impact-intensive alternative can be 
selected. Other factors that may be considered in the fnal selection might include cost-effciency, 
practicality of implementation, public support, and the overall beneft attained from the proposed 
transportation project. 
Alternatives need to be developed and evaluated in a systematic manner. Anyone likely to be 
impacted by the project should certainly be part of this process. In fact, the generation of ideas for 
alternatives may be one of the more effective ways for stakeholders to participate since the initial 
steps of this process do not necessarily rely on professional expertise, but rather on knowledge of 
the area and its constraints. Also, it is important to consider multi-modal or public transit options 
when assessing transportation projects. In some cases, the transportation need may be met more 
effciently when creative, alternative options are considered. 
For each alternative, it is important to consider what it will take to mitigate any potential negative 
environmental impacts. Mitigation can be defned as actions that avoid, minimize, rectify, reduce 
or compensate for the undesirable impacts of development activities. Mitigation measures can take 
many forms, such as location modifcation, alternative design, innovative construction techniques, 
operational conditions, and/or land replacement. Examples for the construction of highway could 
include changing the location of a bridge or road to avoid or reduce the effect on a wetland; elevating 
a roadway on piers; limiting the construction period to avoid breeding season of wildlife; prohibit￾ing trucks or heavy vehicles from the use of a road; or creating new wetlands to compensate for 
those affected or destroyed by the highway construction. The mitigation techniques can be dictated 
by federal or state legislation or can arise from an agreement between the transportation agency and 
a private group of citizens who are affected by the project. The specifc mitigation requirements will 
depend on the specifc impact. 
Once a comprehensive list of alternatives, their impacts, and their proposed mitigation measures 
is developed, a screening process should be initiated to determine the viability of each potential 
option. Here, technical expertise and data-driven decision-making are critical components, and 
ISTUDY 
764 Pavement Engineering 
justifcation for why certain alternatives were considered or not need to be discussed and docu￾mented. A detailed analysis of the viable alternatives would follow—resulting in a fnal selection of 
the preferred approach. 
27.4.4 PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT AND REVIEW 
The NEPA process stipulates specifc timelines and procedures for public review and comment and 
assumes that appropriate measures are taken to include public input into the development of the 
various NEPA documents. Public comment is formally accepted in writing or as oral testimony at 
public hearings. Minimum review-and-comment periods are specifed as: 
• 30 days beginning with the issuance of the NOI 
• 45 days beginning with the issuance of the Draft EIS 
• 30 days beginning with the issuance of the Final EIS 
There are other, more robust models for public involvement in transportation projects. Many of these 
are discussed by FHWA on their Public Involvement web page.12 This site includes a guide for resi￾dents on the project development process and how the public can be effectively involved; best prac￾tices on involving people with limited English profciency; assistance with utilizing Visualization 
to make public participation more meaningful; and other public involvement techniques and case 
studies. 
In 1994, the U.S. president, Bill Clinton, signed the EO 12898, Federal Actions to Address 
Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low Income Populations (59 FR 7629) Act to 
identify and address, as required, disproportionately high adverse human health or environmental 
effects of each agency’s programs policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income 
populations. The resulting USDOT directive was the order titled, Actions to Address Environmental 
Justice In Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations dated (1995). The primary issues in 
enforcing this directive need to be addressed through an intensive public involvement process, such 
as those during project development meetings. Steps may consist of the development of a study area 
and a reference population, determination of affected people, and impact evaluation. 
In 2011, the U.S. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) released two guidance documents 
relating to Environmental Justice. Guidance on Environmental Justice in NEPA13 details specifc 
considerations that project proponents should address when preparing NEPA Documents and under￾going their design. The second document, Environmental Justice and NEPA in the Transportation 
Arena: Project Highlights,14 synthesizes ten (10) case studies (see Table 27.3) and concludes with 
three principles of effective practice: 
1. Identifying Existing Minority and Low-Income Populations and Community Characteristics 
2. Coordination, Access to Information, and Participation 
3. Identifying Disproportionately High and Adverse Effects. 
The frst principle stresses the importance of not relying on just one data source to identify who 
might be impacted by a proposed project. While Census demographic data serves as an appropriate 
base, it may not paint a full picture of the culture and needs of under-represented populations, and it 
may not capture recent trends. The decennial data set needs to be supplemented with local, regional, 
or state data. Case Study #5 (Texas) combined American Community Survey data with regional 
transportation modeling data to accomplish this goal. 
Additionally, the planning and design process for major projects can easily span a decade, and 
project proponents need to stay current with emerging changes in population shifts. Case study #1 
(Durham, North Carolina) was initiated in 2003, but construction was not anticipated to occur until 
2014. There were signifcant increases in the Hispanic and Latino populations in the project area

Case Description 
Alston Avenue in Durham, North Carolina, runs through a 
historically Black/African American community with a 
growing Hispanic/Latino population. When the North 
Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) proposed 
to widen an approximately 1-mile stretch of the corridor, an 
initial community impact assessment (CIA) was conducted. 
At that time, input received through public outreach did not 
lead the NCDOT to determine that the removal of Los 
Primos Supermarket would be an adverse impact on the 
community. As the study continued and the agency received 
additional input from the City of Durham and community 
groups, NCDOT determined that a closer look at potential 
implications of the loss of the Los Primos Supermarket was 
needed. The NCDOT conducted a series of supplemental 
studies and additional outreach to further describe the 
services provided by Los Primos, determine whether a new 
grocery store at a nearby location could provide the same 
services, and characterize the potential impacts of removing 
or relocating Los Primos on the surrounding low-income, 
minority community with high numbers of car-less 
households. 
The Middle Harbor Redevelopment Project in the Port of 
Long Beach (POLB), California, combines and upgrades the 
POLB’s two aging, irregularly shaped marine container 
terminals to create one rectangular-shaped facility that would 
operate more effciently, improve the environment, support 
the economy, and create thousands of new jobs. As part of 
the NEPA process, the POLB and the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers (Corps) conducted an environmental justice 
analysis to study the potential for the Middle Harbor Project 
construction and operations to result in disproportionately 
high and adverse human health or environmental effects on 
low-income and minority populations. The population in 
most of the Census block groups within the project study 
area exceeds 80% minority, and exceeds 10% low income. 
Disproportionately high and adverse impacts on 
environmental justice communities were related to 
construction noise, and cumulative impacts on air quality and 
health risk. This case highlights the POLB’s Community 
Mitigation Grant Program that funds projects that would 
improve air quality in the region overall, ultimately 
contributing to mitigation of impacts identifed in the 
environmental justice analysis for the Middle Harbor 
Redevelopment Project and cumulative impacts from other 
ongoing port projects and operations. Despite associated 
impacts, the project received broad support and was 
approved on April 13, 2009. Project construction started in 
spring 2011.

Case Description 
The North I-25 project area, located in northern Colorado 
between Fort Collins and Denver, spreads over 61 miles north to 
south and 20 to 30 miles east to west, affecting 45 counties and 
communities. The project area is home to various environmental 
justice groups including a Hmong community, an Asian ethnic 
group from southern China and Southeast Asia, and Hispanic/ 
Latino ethnic communities that required specialized outreach 
efforts. Given the large extent of the project area, each 
community had its own concerns and issues. Through 
consensus building and collaborative decision-making, a 
preferred alternative that addressed the concerns of local 
stakeholders was identifed. Each project alternative (known as 
packages) proposed multi-modal improvements involving bus, 
rail, and highway improvements on different alignments. 
The largely minority Mexicantown community in Detroit, 
Michigan, was physically divided in 1970, when a section of 
freeway along I-75 was completed. During preparation of the 
Environmental Assessment (EA) for the I-75 Ambassador 
Bridge Gateway Project (Gateway Project) in the 1990s, the 
Michigan Department of Transportation (MIDOT) and the 
FHWA identifed reconnecting East and West Mexicantown 
across I-75 as a “need” to be addressed. As Bagley Street is 
one of the main links between East and West Mexicantown, 
support for a pedestrian bridge spanning I-75 at this location 
was embraced by the community. The Mexicantown 
community was engaged throughout every phase of the 
Gateway Project, including the design of the Bagley 
Pedestrian Bridge. Successful completion of the Bagley 
Pedestrian Bridge Project signifed positive changes to come 
for the Mexicantown community linking the east and west 
sides of the neighborhood once again. The public ceremony 
for the brand new landmark and tourist attraction was 
marked by the joining of U.S. and Mexican government 
representatives, along with visitors from across the State and 
Mexicantown residents, to unveil the two stunning new 
works of art that grace the bridge’s eastern plaza. 
The North Central Texas Council of Governments 
(NCTCOG), the metropolitan planning organization (MPO) 
for the Dallas-Fort Worth area, studied the environmental 
justice impacts of the tolled highways and high-occupancy 
vehicle (HOV)/managed lanes in the region’s long-range 
plan. The Regional Tolling Analysis (RTA) was an outgrowth 
of the Mobility 2030 plan, which was adopted in 2007, and 
was updated as part of the most recent metropolitan 
long-range transportation plan, Mobility 2035, adopted in 
2011. A frst of its kind in Texas, the RTA used information 
gathered from the travel demand model to evaluate impacts 
of proposed transportation projects with a pricing component 
(e.g., toll roads) on environmental justice populations 
throughout the NCTCOG metropolitan planning area.

Case Description 
Because the projects involved tolling, low-income 
populations were the primary focus of the study. Using 16 
dimensions of system analysis, the RTA found that any 
cumulative burdens were outweighed by cumulative benefts, 
and there would be no disproportionately high and adverse 
cumulative impacts on environmental justice populations. 
Information gained during the RTA is also included in 
individual environmental documents for roadway projects 
that have a tolling element. This does not replace the 
complete environmental justice analysis and associated 
public involvement conducted as part of the environmental 
review of projects. 
The construction of I-70 near Denver, Colorado, in the 1960s, 
and the resulting split of predominantly minority and 
low-income surrounding neighborhoods, left a legacy of 
distrust for the Colorado Department of Transportation 
(CDOT). When CDOT set out to improve the I-70 East 
corridor in 2003, they knew they had to work proactively and 
collaboratively with these same communities to build their 
trust and ensure their active and meaningful participation in 
the environmental study. The outreach conducted for the 
project set new ground for CDOT. The emphasis of the 
outreach process was on gaining maximum participation 
from the local communities. This also meant educating the 
communities about technical areas such as noise and 
transportation design and how they affect lives. The case also 
included an extensive air quality analysis, analysis of 
health-related impacts, and the evaluation of a community￾based alternative. 
The community of Pleasant Hill in Macon, Georgia, was 
bisected by the construction of I-75 in the early 1960s. Forty 
years later, proposed improvements to the I-16/I-75 
interchange had the potential to adversely impact Pleasant 
Hill once again. Thanks to the engagement of this historical 
Black/African American community during the study of 
proposed improvements, with strong support from FHWA 
and the State DOT, potential adverse impacts of the selected 
alternative were minimized, and a mitigation plan was 
developed and incorporated into the project with a written 
commitment from all parties to its implementation. 
Davistown is one of the oldest Black/African American 
communities in the Lexington, Kentucky area. During the 
preparation of the EIS for the project, it was determined that 
indirect impacts associated with the Newtown Pike 
Extension would be expected to increase the land value in 
Davistown and surrounding neighborhoods and would 
effectively force out low-income residents through increased 
redevelopment pressures. Davistown residents had been 
adversely affected by decades of discussions around a 
potential Newtown Pike Extension through their 
neighborhood, resulting in a sense of distrust at the outset of 
the environmental study. The project team hired a 
community liaison and included community members on

during that time, and the identifcation process was repeated multiple times in order to ensure that 
adverse impacts were avoided. 
Besides identifying where underrepresented populations reside and work, it is important to 
develop an understanding of how they move about the area and conduct their lives. Demographic 
data was effectively supplemented with visual and door-to-door surveys, interviews, and extensive 
public involvement in Case Studies #7 and #9. In some cases, this extensive outreach can result in 
an adjustment to the project area boundaries (See Case #10). 
The second principle relates to the activities that should take place with the vulnerable popula￾tions after they have been identifed. To begin with, these communities may need to be educated 
on the concept of environmental justice, and what it means for them. This helps to enable them to 
become participants in the process, rather than just the audience for the project proponents’ ideas 
and solutions. Once people are provided with an understanding of the process and their rights and 
responsibilities within it, it becomes feasible to engage and empower them. And the most success￾ful projects are those where the impacted public are part of the process of identifying the potential 
effects of the proposed projects as well as developing approaches for mitigation. Many of the case 
studies listed in Table 27.3 showcase this concept. In particular, Cases 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 describe the 
means in which a level of trust could be reached so that the best outcomes could be achieved. 
The last principle is related to the identifcation of impacts and the determination of severity of 
adverse effects. Part of the research is intended to identify positive and negative impacts—but more 
importantly, to determine whether some populations bear the brunt of negative impacts more than 
other populations—or whether some populations receive a disproportionate beneft from the pro￾posed work. Impacts are not always objectively defned; defning them requires an understanding of 
perceived impact in addition to anything that can be quantifed from a planning or engineering pro￾cess. For example, Case Study #8 describes a community that was interdependent on those within 
that community for their daily needs. Relocation would have a signifcant and detrimental impact on 
their ability to maintain their quality of life. Mitigation, therefore, addressed affordable housing— 
something that may not have even been considered without a robust public involvement process. 
27.5 ENFORCEMENT AND POST-PROJECT MONITORING 
Once identifed, the mitigation efforts or commitments are indicated in construction specifcation 
and project plans. Enforcement may be made through a simple memorandum of understanding 
between the overseeing agency and the transportation construction agency, or it may require with￾holding of funds from grantees, or it could be facilitated by the existence of performance bonds that 
are required for many road construction projects. If administrative follow ups are not successful, 
citations and formal litigation proceedings may be the last resort for rectifying failed enforcement. 
In the U.S., the relevant enforcement authorities are the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
and the Army Corps of Engineers. EPA, established in 1970, has the authority to implement and 
enforce the various laws. It reviews and comments on EISs prepared by other federal agencies. It 
also charges the Army Corps of Engineers (COR) to review the EIS, especially for projects that 
could impact water bodies. 
In some cases, the approval of highway construction projects in a specifc state would require the 
state to show that the new construction would not lead to violation of any environmental (such as 
air) quality standard; nor will it make diffcult to achieve compliance with the mitigation system in 
order to get approved by the federal agency. 
Improvement in enforcement of mitigation measures can be made by administrative mecha￾nism or judicially, with the help of different provisions and acts, as appropriate for the country/ 
state. Examples of such provisions in the U.S. are those of the National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA), Section 4(f) of the DOT Act, National Historic Preservation Act, Clean Water Act and the 
Clean Air Act. Enforcement through the court could also be made with the help of enforcement of 
agreements by parties to the agreement, third party benefciary law or under the nuisance law. 
ISTUDY 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
770 Pavement Engineering 
Note that the mitigation measures need to be tracked and monitored for a certain number of years 
(say 3 to 5 years for wetland replacement) to evaluate the effectiveness of the mitigation procedure. 
An example of a law governing mitigation monitoring is the Clear Water Act. Section 404 of this 
act states that if a high construction activity leads to the flling of natural wetlands, compensation 
must be provided by the creation of an artifcial wetland. The U.S. Army corps of Engineers, as 
directed by the Environment protection Agency (EPA) is in charge of ensuring the compliance with 
the Clean Water Act for any project that is undertaken by a DOT. 
The subject of post project monitoring and analysis for improving environmental impact mitiga￾tion has been researched extensively, and a number of methods have been suggested. For example, 
The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has suggested the use of Post￾Project Analysis (PPA)15 as a tool for to facilitate the enforcement of mitigation activities and also 
to learn from a specifc project for future applications. 
In the PPA method, frst, the importance of environmental concern and its relationship to eco￾nomic development have been recognized. The use of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) 
has been presented as the starting point for the evaluation of effects of an economic activity before 
the development of that activity, through the investigation of the effects, identifcation of mitigation 
activities and overall environmental management. To be effective, EIAs must be able to predict the 
impact of a project accurately and convincingly and allow the formulation of a mitigation plan even 
in the case of lack of certainty regarding those impacts. The PPA is presented as a cost-effective tool 
to improve the EIA process. The PPAs are defned as environmental studies that are conducted during 
all phases of a project implementation—before construction, during construction or operation and at 
the time of abandonment. The process consists of examining, documenting and analyzing impacts 
and the effectiveness of impacts of the projects, in terms of scientifc and technical aspects and the 
management system, during their implementation. The PPA process helps identify cases where the 
mitigation measures are actually necessary and improve the EIA process by providing feedback about 
its effectiveness. The 22 clauses of PPA, as put forth by the UNECE, are shown in Table 27.4. 
TABLE 27.4 
Post-project analysis (UN, 1990) (needs permission) 
Tha task force concluded that post-project analyses are a very effective and necessary means of continuing the EIA process 
into the implementation phase because of their uses for the following purposes: 
(a) To monitor compliance with the agreed conditions set out in construction permits and operating licences; 
(b) To review predicted environmental impacts for proper management of risks and uncertainties; 
(c) To modify the activity or develop mitigation measures in case of unpredicted harmful effects on the environment; 
(d) To determine the accuracy of past impact predictions and the effectiveness of mitigation measures in order to transfer 
this experience to future activities of the same type; and 
(e) To review the effectiveness of environmental management for the activity. 
With a view to promoting the use of effective and effcient PPAs as well as to strengthening EIA processes in the 
project implementation phase, it is recommended that: 
1. Post-project analysis should be used to complete the environmental impact assessment process by providing the 
necessary feedback in the project implementation phase both for proper and cost-effective management and for EIA 
process development. 
2. ECE Governments should apply the specifc recommendations set out hereafter to suitable projects and should report back 
to the Senior Advisers in three years’ time on the results of those PPAs and experience gained m their implementation. 
Relationships between environmental impact assessment and_post-project analysis 
3. A preliminary plan for the PPA should be prepared during the environmental review of a project; the PPA framework 
should be fully developed when the EIA decision on the project is made. 
4. The PPA should focus on important impacts about which there is insuffcient information; identifcation of these 
impacts and their priorities is undertaken during the environmental review process. 
ISTUDYEnvironmental Mitigation in Transportation Projects 771 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. The authority to undertake a PPA should be linked to the EIA process so that the concerns identifed for inclusion in 
the PPA during the environmental review can be properly addressed. 
6. The conditions of approval for a project should be such that the environmental management for that project will take 
into account the fndings of the PPA. 
7. PPAs should be done for all major projects with potentially signifcant impacts. In addition, for other projects, 
focused PPAs may be suitable either for environmental management of the project or to learn from the project. 
Content of PPA 
8. The development of hypotheses to test should be a part of PPAs. The hypotheses will depend greatly on the nature of 
the PPA and may involve comparisons of impacts with predictions or with standards or they may relate to how well 
the environmental management system worked. 
9. In order to undertake PPAs effectively, baseline data relevant to the hypotheses should be collected and be as 
complete as possible. 
10. Monitoring and evaluation of the data collected in the monitoring process should be an essential part of PPA. These 
steps are needed in order to test the hypotheses. 
11. Documentation of the project and its impacts should be encouraged in order to improve PPAs. 
PPA development and design 
12. The frst and most crucial step in developing a PPA should be to defne its purpose. This would include the development 
of a specifc purpose and focus for each component of the PPA. 
13. Once the purpose of the PPA is known and its conceptual content identifed (from the environmental review), it is 
essential to defne the roles and responsibilities of the various participants in the PPA the proponent, the various 
government agencies, scientifc and technical advisers, and the public. 
14. Management and participant responses required in the light of PPA fndings should be, as far as possible, specifcally 
addressed. 
15. The need to deal with environmental surprises must be built into PPAs. Monitoring should be done in such a way that 
unexpected results have a good chance of being detected and those responsible for the PPA should have the power to 
respond appropriately to unexpected results. 
16. The use of independent experts to help design the PPA should be encouraged as it leads to a better and more 
credible PPA. 
17. The detailed development of the PPA should consider features such as the different phases of the project (preconstruction, 
construction, operation and abandonment), the need for integration of different aspects being studied, and the need to 
relate the effects being monitored to the project (separating out confounding effects of other activities). 
PPA management 
18. As a tool for managing PPAs, advisory boards consisting of industry, government, contractors, independent experts 
and public representatives, should be used. Such boards with well-defned terms of reference increase the credibility 
and quality of the PPA. 
19. Public participation in the PPA should be encouraged. 
20. PPA reports should be made public. 
21. The use should be encouraged of independent researchers to do those parts of a PPA that are particularly sensitive and 
for which work done by the proponent (or possibly even by a government agency) may not be regarded as credible. 
22. PPAs should be managed adaptively with opportunities to refne them depending on the results obtained. More effort 
should be put into examining those effects that ate observed and important, and less effort should be expended on 
those effects which the PPA indicates are not resulting in signifcant impacts. 
Notes: 
1 An analysis of the information which led to the conclusion and recommendations is contained in Chapter III B. 
2 The United Kingdom fully concurs with the principle that the actual effects of a development project on the environment 
should be evaluated, after development consent has been given, both during the construction phase and subsequently during 
the project's operation. Such evaluation needs to be continuous and to be accompanied by powers to enforce environmental 
standards and conditions of operation, to require action to remedy adverse environmental effects and to secure improvements, 
for example by continually upgrading plant to the standard of the best available technology not entailing excessive cost, or 
by the tightening of pollution controls in the light of new evidence of risk. The United Kingdom has long-standing provisions 
of this kind, applying to all relevant installations, not only those which have been subject to environmental impact assess￾ment. These provisions will be refned and expanded by planned new legislation on the introduction of an integrated system 
of pollution control for industry. In the United Kingdom's view the elaborate post-project procedures recommended by the 
task force would not improve on these arrangements. (In accordance with document ECE/ENVWA/9, paragraph 42).

27.6 TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND 
REGIONAL MITIGATION APPROACHES 
Regional and statewide transportation planning, such as that which is mandated in urban areas in 
the United States, offers the opportunity to address many of the long-term, cumulative impacts of 
transportation projects as well as provide a foundation for assessing and minimizing the short-term, 
direct impacts. Beginning in 1962, the U.S. Federal Highway Act has required the development of 
long-range transportation plans in urbanized areas (as defned by the U.S. Census) with popula￾tions of greater than 50,000 people. These requirements are implemented by Metropolitan Planning 
Organizations (MPOs), which are policy boards that make decisions on transportation funding and 
priorities within the region. Over the years, the Act has been reauthorized under different names, 
and some of the more current Acts have included specifc provisions for dealing with mitigation of 
highway improvement projects. 
The Intermodal Surface Transportation Effciency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) provided a framework for 
making transportation project related decisions more compliant with environmental needs and regu￾lations, such as the Clean Air Act. Demonstrating that transportation improvements will not worsen 
air quality is still a requirement for states and MPOs today. ISTEA also required the completion of 
the Major Investment Study (MIS) as a standardized way to demonstrate compliance with planning 
requirements and considerations of environmental impacts. One of the goals was to consider mobility 
and travel needs at a corridor-level, rather than at a localized roadway level, in order to conduct an 
effective alternatives analysis. The MIS process is no longer formally required, but many agencies still 
use the principles of the MIS in the development of transportation improvement projects. 
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Effcient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users 
(SAFETEA-LU) (Pub. L. 109-59, August 10, 2005), required long-range statewide transportation 
plans to include a discussion of potential environmental mitigation activities and potential areas 
to carry out these activities, including activities that may have the greatest potential to restore and 
maintain the environmental functions affected by the long-range statewide transportation plan. The 
requirement was intended to encourage consideration of environmental impacts at the planning 
level—well in advance of project scoping and design. In addition, SAFETEA-LU required that 
states and MPOs demonstrate consultation efforts with various stakeholders, including groups and 
agencies whose missions include environmental protection. The intent was to ensure consistency 
between various planning efforts and, again, to identify mitigation opportunities early in the plan￾ning process. 
These requirements recognize that the impacts of transportation projects are felt beyond the geo￾graphic limits of the project and in some cases, beyond the life-cycle of the project. The U.S. Federal 
Highway Administration published an assessment of various state and regional efforts regarding 
regional mitigation in 2009. The report is entitled “Environmental Mitigation in Transportation 
Planning: Case Studies in Meeting SAFETEA-LU Section 6001 Requirements.”16 Two of the case 
studies are summarized briefy here. 
The Minnesota Department of Transportation began implementing a wetlands banking program 
in the 1980s. By 2005, the established system offered the state DOT an easy way to demonstrate 
compliance with SAFETA-LU’s new requirements. Essentially, a “no net loss of wetlands goal” was 
established, and an ecosystem approach was taken to identify the highest value and/or most at-risk 
wetlands at regional and watershed levels. These are purchased, preserved, and used as credits to 
offset wetland impacts of future transportation improvement projects. The DOT estimates that they 
have enough wetlands “banked” to address wetlands mitigation for another 10–15 years of trans￾portation projects. This approach is considered superior to mitigating at the project-specifc level, 
and the state has since implemented a similar approach for historic bridges. In addition, they are 
broadening the program to address habitat connectivity, not just wetlands. 
The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) developed a Regional Comprehensive 
Plan in 2004, which addressed a broad range of issues, such as housing, transportation, and the 
ISTUDYEnvironmental Mitigation in Transportation Projects 773 
environment. It was used as a companion to the long-range transportation plan and included an 
inventory of baseline natural resource data that could be used to monitor environmental health 
as well as impacts to transportation-related construction. This approach supports the State’s 1991 
Natural Community Conservation Planning Act, which bases conservation efforts regarding endan￾gered species on ecosystem approach rather than focusing on a single species. SANDAG also raises 
funding through a 1/2-cent sales tax, the proceeds of which support acquisition of land that will be 
preserved or used to restore habitat that is slated to be disturbed by transportation projects. The ben￾eft of conducting land conservation at the regional planning level is that acquisitions can be made 
more effciently and at lower costs than they would be if they were carried out at the project scoping 
and design level. In addition, the value of an entire ecosystem can be preserved upfront, rather than 
addressing site-specifc impacts after transportation design decisions are made. 
In 2012, the national transportation legislation, Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century 
Act (MAP-21), continued the planning level approach to mitigating the environmental impacts of 
transportation projects. The emphasis was now on accelerating project delivery to meet the increas￾ing need to improve and upgrade the nation’s transportation infrastructure. Mitigation measures 
were encouraged at the planning and regional levels including, 
• Participation in mitigation banking or other third-party mitigation arrangements 
• Contributions to statewide and regional efforts to conserve, restore, enhance, and create 
natural habitats and wetlands 
The development of statewide and regional environmental protection plans, including natural habi￾tat and wetland conservation and restoration plans.17 
These measures and approaches were continued in 2015 with Fixing America’s Surface 
Transportation Act (FAST). 
At the time of publication of this textbook, the United States’ transportation improvement 
strategies and goals had been codifed in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (Infrastructure and 
Investment Jobs Act, Public Law 117–58).18 The specifc regulations regarding mitigation were yet 
to be developed; but emphasis continued to be placed on regional planning in urban areas. 
In summary, the development of mitigation strategies for transportation improvement proj￾ects should never be limited to the site-specifc level. In many areas, there are likely regional or 
statewide planning efforts in place or underway that will assist the transportation project engi￾neer in identifying high-priority impacts to be avoided or addressed; offering policy guidance on 
effcient mitigation techniques; providing natural resource data (often in a GIS-based platform) 
to be used in impact analyses; and/or supporting communication with various stakeholders that 
may be impacted by the transportation project. Working within these frameworks can also ease 
the burden of regulatory compliance and ultimately, address indirect and cumulative impacts of 
transportation projects. 
Questions 
1. Describe the difference between a direct and an indirect effect of a transportation project. 
2. List fve potential impacts of a roadway improvement project that adds an additional travel 
lane in each direction of a 6-mile roadway segment, paves and widens the shoulders, and 
constructs sidewalks with granite curbing on one side of the roadway. 
3. Identify a state that has passed an Environmental Policy Act, similar to the National 
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), to regulate environmental impacts of development 
projects. Cite the name and regulation number for the Act. To which entities or under what 
circumstances does the legislation apply? 
4. Why is a “no build” scenario an important component of an alternatives analysis? 
5. Find a recently published Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for a trans￾portation improvement project. Imagine you are representing the community in which
