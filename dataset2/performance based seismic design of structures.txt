Performance-Based Seismic 
Design of Structures
Seismic design of structures is fast turning to performance-based design (PBD) from 
old codal force-based design (FBD) method. The aim of the book is to expose the 
readers to the meaning and need of PBD, the evolution of PBD to date, its various forms 
and applications. Various design philosophies and procedures have been described 
including modelling aspects and hazard considerations backed by examples. Direct 
displacement-based design (DDBD) and unified PBD (UPBD) of reinforced concrete 
(RC) frame buildings, RC dual systems, steel frame buildings and bridge piers have 
also been explained.
The main features of this book are as follows:
• Illustrates performance-based seismic design to achieve the design target by 
performance objective-oriented design procedure.
• Covers modern design philosophies, modelling aspects, concepts in 
nonlinearities and use of supplemental damping devices.
• Contains a chapter on seismic safety of nonstructural components.
• Describes UPBD design procedure and examples of different structural systems.
• Includes application and examples with reference to SAP2000 software.
This book is aimed at graduate students, researchers and professionals in civil engin￾eering, earthquake engineering and structural design.Performance-Based Seismic

Foreword
Much progress has been made for decades after it was realized by engineers that earth￾quake generates an inertia force in the structure. This inertia force is the root cause of all 
damages in human-made structures during strong ground motion. Initially, the quantum 
of such inertia force was empirically taken as about 10% of the mass of the structure. 
This led to the development of the code-based seismic design. The central theme of the 
codes is the response spectrum concept (G.W. Housner, 1941) from which the design 
spectra evolved (Newmark and Hall, 1982). Initially, the equivalent lateral static force was 
computed for the structure based on first-mode vibrational characteristics. Later on, the 
dynamic response spectrum method evolved, which was able to accommodate the effect 
of many modes. The journey had an upward gradient, but the internal flaw remained that 
the entire gamut of the code rested on force as the primary design criterion.
The failure of several well-built structures designed using prevalent code under 
strong ground motions led the experts to rethink the efficacy of the force-based 
design (FBD) philosophy. With time, it was understood that displacement is a better 
choice in design over force. The displacement-based design (DBD) philosophy 
was conceptualized with this new understanding. In the 1970s, the capacity spec￾trum method (Freeman) was developed. Then came the series of developments in the 
form of ATC-40 (graphical capacity spectrum method) and other Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) documents. Today, the DBD philosophy has been 
absorbed into performance-based seismic design (PBSD) philosophy, where the 
design is practically under the performance-oriented control of the designers.
I take delight in introducing the book Performance-Based Seismic Design of 
Structures by Prof. S. Choudhury. The author has long years of experience in teaching 
the subject at the post-graduate and undergraduate levels. His area of research interest 
is also in this arena. In 20 chapters, the book covers performance-based seismic 
design philosophies applied to various structures and related topics. The author has 
also introduced his innovative design philosophy named unified performance-based 
design (UPBD), which is supposed to be more comprehensive. This method has been 
applied to various structures, as detailed in the book.
The first six chapters provide the introductory materials. Chapters 7 to 11 deal with 
the design of various types of buildings including steel buildings. Chapter 12 explains 
the infill effect on buildings. Chapters 13 to 20 cover other miscellaneous designs and 
advanced contemporary issues on PBSD.
The structural design world is tending towards PBSD. Against this backdrop, a 
book like this is welcome. I hope the book will satisfy the needs of students, designers 
and researchers in the field of PBD.

Preface
Structural design, including seismic design, historically and traditionally started 
with force as the primary focus in design, giving rise to force-based design (FBD). 
Codal design is mostly force-based. But with experience, two things became clear: 
(i) structures designed using codal FBD continued to suffer damage and even collapsed 
under strong ground motions and (ii) the aim of the design is to minimize damage, 
whereas force is not a direct measure of damage; displacement is the right parameter 
to quantify the damage. With this understanding, displacement was introduced as the 
core design parameter. This led to the development of displacement-based design 
(DBD). With the incorporation of various design criteria, performance indicators and 
specified hazards in the DBD, a new design named performance-based design (PBD) 
was conceptualized. PBD, also called performance-based engineering (PBE), can be 
applied to various fields of engineering. This book will discuss performance-based 
seismic design (PBSD) for buildings and other structures.
The advantages of PBSD are: (i) target-oriented design, that is, designing with 
pre-defined target criteria; (ii) design possible for any hazard level; (iii) designs are 
made possible for various target objectives (multi-objective design); (iv) applicability 
to various structures; and (vi) design philosophy is clear and sound.
Various codes have, of late, started incorporating PBD; for example, ASCE-SEI￾41 incorporated the PBD.
I have taught this subject at the post-graduate and undergraduate levels for more 
than 15 years. I have observed very keen interest among the students in the subject. 
This has given me the chance to experiment with the subject, including executing 
many projects with the students. The net result of these efforts is the present book.
The book is organized into 20 chapters, as detailed below.
Chapter 1 introduces the topic of PBSD, along with the effect of past earthquakes 
on buildings and nonstructural components, force-based codal design, equal dis￾placement and equal energy principles, and strength-stiffness dependency. Finally, 
the need for PBD has been discussed.
The historical development of PBSD, various design methods including 
displacement-based design (DBD), introduction to capacity spectrum method, direct 
displacement-based design (DDBD), unified performance-based design (UPBD) and 
capacity design have been taken up in Chapter 2.
Chapter 3 describes hazard considerations. Hazard nomenclature is presented. 
Hazards as given in SEI-7-16, SEI-41-17, EC-8 (2004) and IS 1893 (2016) have been 
illustrated. The construction of displacement spectra has been explained.
Modelling aspects have been treated in Chapter 4 at length. Various strength levels, 
effective stiffness, modelling of beam, column and shear wall have been discussed. 
Modelling of infill, P-delta effect, ductility considerations, torsional effect, and 
confined vs. unconfined concrete have been treated. A sufficient number of numerical 
examples have been provided.
Chapter 5 deals with performance criteria and performance levels. Structural and 
nonstructural performance levels and their viable combinations have been discussed. xviii Preface
The criteria for member performance levels are explained. Multi-objective design is 
highlighted.
Wherever necessary, examples have been given to clarify the theoretical concepts. 
Exercises have been added in all chapters for practice purposes.
The evaluation of structure through analyses is treated in Chapter 6. Linear and 
nonlinear analyses and P-delta effect, are discussed. The nonlinear static method 
(pushover analysis) has been discussed in depth. The evaluation of performance point 
through capacity spectrum method and displacement coefficient method have been 
discussed in detail.
Chapter 7 discusses the direct displacement-based design (DDBD) for reinforced 
concrete (RC) frame buildings as per Pettinga and Priestley (2005). Theoretical 
background, design steps and numerical examples are provided. Chapter 8 similarly 
deals with the DDBD method for dual system after Sullivan et al. (2006). Frame–
wall interaction has been highlighted. Sufficient examples are given to illustrate the 
applications.
Chapter 9 introduces unified performance-based design (UPBD) for RC frame 
buildings. UPBD being a relatively new philosophy, the theoretical background, 
design procedure and implications of the formula for beam depth have been adequately 
explained. Numerical examples are given to help understand the implementation part 
of the design. Along a similar line, the UPBD method for dual system is dealt with 
in Chapter 10. The UPBD method for steel frame buildings, which is quite different 
from RC buildings, has been explained in Chapter 11.
Along with the exposure to the relevant topics, sufficient hints are available in the 
book for future research.
The effect of infill in buildings and modelling of infill has been taken up in 
Chapter 12. The DDBD method for RC buildings incorporating fluid viscous dampers 
is covered in Chapter 13.
Chapter 14 describes the displacement-based design of bridge piers, while 
Chapter 15 deals with the UPBD method for bridge piers.
Chapters 16 through Chapter 20 deal with various topics like energy dissipating 
devices, tuned liquid dampers, tuned mass dampers, non-structural components 
(operational and functional components) of buildings, preliminary of probability in 
engineering, fragility analysis and the principle of base isolation.
The effort of the author shall be deemed fruitful if it serves the need of the students, 
professionals and researchers in a befitting way.
I shall be grateful to the readers including students, professionals and researchers 
for any suggestion, criticism or correction they forward to me to improve the book 
in the future.

1 Force-Based Design and 
its Limitations
1.1 INTRODUCTION
Ensuring the safety of structures against earthquake events has remained a challen￾ging task for the design engineers. Our understanding of the seismic behaviours of 
structure evolves with time, so does the seismic design philosophy. Historically, it 
was a leap forward when engineers understood that the earthquake generates a lateral 
force in the structure, which is proportional to its mass. Typically, an empirical esti￾mate of such lateral seismic force was taken as 10% of the weight of the structure. 
This was the beginning of force-based design (FBD) for seismic actions. In 1914, 
Sano, a Japanese engineer, proposed a seismic design method, which is now called 
as “seismic coefficient method”. Following the 1908 Messina earthquake (Italy), a 
commission was formed, which gave a recommendation for an earthquake-resistant 
design of structures, now known as “equivalent static method” (Bozorgnia and Bertero, 
2004). The first design code that came into existence was introduced at Santa Barbara 
following the Santa Barbara earthquake of 1925. Design codes of various countries 
prescribe design procedures for earthquake-resistant design (ERD). But the structures 
designed following the prescriptions of such codes are found to be not always safe 
under severe seismic events, and structures continue to fail or get severely damaged all 
over the world under major earthquakes. This highlights the limitations of the present 
codal method of design, which lays emphasis on force alone as the core design param￾eter. With time, the limitations of codal FBD have become apparent to the engineering 
community. From 1975 onwards, the concept of performance-based design (PBD) 
has gradually evolved. In this design philosophy, the structure is designed for a target 
performance objective under an expected hazard level. Displacement, rather than the 
force, becomes the guiding parameter in this method of design. Performance object￾ives may include structural performance level and nonstructural performance level. 
Drift may be an important design objective for some structures.
The Uniform Building Code (UBC) was adopted in 1927. Maurice Biot in 1932–
33 gave the concept of response spectrum, which now is an integral part of all 
design codes.
The essence of FBD as prescribed in seismic design codes of various countries is 
to estimate a probable lateral seismic force (called base shear) and then suitably dis￾tribute that force over different levels of the structure as design lateral forces. Design 
is carried out with the prescribed load combinations. All seismic codes give a design 
spectrum or elastic demand spectrum at 5% damping, which is called 5% damped 
elastic demand spectrum. Design spectrum is a smoothened average curve of a large 
number of response spectra of the past earthquakes and probable future artificially 2 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
generated earthquakes for a geographical location. Design spectrum is typically an 
acceleration spectrum. Though fundamentally based on the same principle, the design 
spectra of countries differ from one another due to geo-tectonic variations and con￾sensus of code makers.
1.2 PERFORMANCE OF BUILDINGS IN PAST EARTHQUAKES
It is worthwhile to scrutinize how the building structures designed as per the codes of 
different countries performed under earthquakes in the past. In this direction, of par￾ticular interest and importance are the hospital buildings, as these had been designed 
with more stringent design requirements, particularly with higher base shear (namely, 
with higher importance factor). The damage of hospital buildings leads to losses such 
as (i) loss of property; (ii) loss of human life (patients, doctors and trained health 
workers); (iii) downtime loss due to service impairment; (iv) sufferings of patients 
and injured people who cannot get admitted in damaged or a collapsed hospital; 
(v) cost of evacuation; (vi) cost of damage of operational and functional components 
(OFCs), also known as nonstructural components; (vii) cost of repair/retrofitting, if 
the damage is repairable. Through the damage or collapse of hospital buildings under 
seismic actions, billions of dollars are wasted almost every year. It may be noted that 
the cost of OFCs in a hospital is many times more than that of the building structure 
itself. Nevertheless, the damage to residential buildings and lifeline structures also 
plays a havoc in major earthquakes.
1.2.1 Performance of Building Structures in Past Earthquakes
In this section, we highlight how well or poorly the building structures performed 
in past earthquakes. Such a survey is too vast to be covered in the present book. The 
design of a hospital building needs extra attention due to its high post-earthquake 
importance. Choudhury (2008) made a thorough review of the performance of hos￾pital buildings in the past earthquakes. Table 1.1 shows the earthquake damage to 
buildings over a large span of time.

1.2.2 Performance of Nonstructural Components in 
Past Earthquakes
Equipment and services also go by the name nonstructural components. These are 
also known as operational and functional components (OFCs). The functionality 
of the building comes out of the OFCs. During an earthquake, even if the structure 
performs well, any poor performance of OFCs will lead to shut down of the facil￾ities housed in the structure. McGavin (1981) discussed the anchorage requirement 
of different types of electrical and mechanical equipment. The Structural Engineers’ 
Association of California (SEAOC) has discussed the importance, safety and 
damageability with respect to seismic design of OFCs in the Vision 2000 document. 
The common nonstructural failure was that of the ceiling system, egress and ingress 
system and content damage in shelves. In some earthquakes, the nonstructural 
damage was found to be more than the structural damage (e.g., 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake).
Reports are available on the performances of nonstructural building components in 
past earthquakes. Extensive damage to glazing, mechanical and electrical equipment, 
heating ventilation air conditioning (HVAC) system, elevators, pipes, ceilings, sprinkler 
systems, water supply system, power supply system, building services (building gaps, 
ducts, ceilings, partitions, connecting pipes) and building content have been reported 
for both hospitals and general buildings. In the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the Olive 
View Hospital (OVH), which was rebuilt with enhanced seismic provisions, did not 
suffer structural damage but the large-scale nonstructural damage led to the evacuation 
of the hospital. The mechanical and electrical equipment mounted on rubber springs 
performed poorly. The sprinkler systems were particularly damaged. Lack of adequate 
bracing in the sprinkler within the false ceiling is attributed as the reason for the failure 
of the building. In the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, many elevators failed to operate 
due to the failure of guide rail and counterweight dislodging. In the 1999 Chi Chi 
earthquake of Taiwan, nonstructural damage led to the closure of Shi-Tuwan hospital 
(Nazer and Elahi, 2004). In the 2001, Nisqually earthquake in Washington State, out 
of $2 billion loss, a large part was from damage to OFCs (Filiatrault et al., 2001). 
Dhakal (2010) reported detailed nonstructural damage in the 2010 Darfield earth￾quake. Biranchi et al. (2019) studied nonstructural safety utilizing traditional methods. 
Gabbianelli et al. (2020) reported seismic demand profiles of nonstructural components 
in hospital building.
1.3 CODAL SEISMIC DESIGN PROVISIONS
In the last part of 19th century, the generation of inertia force during earthquake was 
understood by engineers. It was realized that earthquake caused a horizontal force 
in structure that led to the damage. Initially, such horizontal force was taken as 10% 
of total building weight. As mentioned earlier, Sano, a Japanese engineer, in 1914, 
proposed a method that now goes by the name seismic coefficient method (Bozorgnia 
and Bertero, 2004). In 1927, the seismic coefficient method was adopted in UBC. 
In 1948, the Structural Engineer’s Association of Northern California (SEAONC) 
introduced the building period in base shear computation.Force-Based Design and its Limitations 5
In 1957, the committee of the Structural Engineer’s Association of California 
(SEAOC) recommended inclusion of building behaviour factor in the expression for 
base shear, which highlighted the dissipation of energy.
1.3.1  EC-8 (2004) Provisions
The EC-8 (2004) gives base shear formula as in Eq. (1.3.1):
F S b = d ( ) T m1 λ (1.3.1)
where
Fb
 = base shear
S T d 1 ( ) = ordinate of design spectrum corresponding to first mode period T1
m = mass of the building
λ = correction factor which is given as -
λ = = 0 85 ≤ 2 2 1 . , if T T and the building is has more than storie C s
= otherwise


 1 0.
The first mode time period is given as
T1 H0 75 = 0 075 . . for moment resistant concrete space frame
T1 H0 75 = 0 085 . . for moment resistant steel space frame
T1 H0 75 = 0 0. 5 . for all other structures,
where H is height of building. Tc is corner period
1.3.2  Indian Seismic Code IS 1893-2016
Indian seismic code, IS 1893-2016, gives seismic design principles for buildings and 
other structures. In addition, IS 13920-2016 gives ductile detailing requirements 
for reinforced concrete (RC) structures. For steel structures, the ductile detailing 
provisions are given in SP 6(6). The highest possible earthquake designated in 
the code is called maximum considered earthquake (MCE). On the other hand, 
the design basis earthquake (DBE) is that which can occur during the life span 
of the structure under which the damage is limited. DBE is taken as half of MCE 
level. The design spectrum shape is given in the code for three types of soils, 
namely, hard soil or rock, medium soil and soft soil. Further, design spectrum is 
given separately for equivalent static load method and response spectrum method. 
The whole of India is divided into four seismic zones named as Zone II, Zone III, 
Zone IV and Zone V. Zone I does not appear here as it was earlier merged with 
Zone II. The corresponding zone factors (seismicity level) are 0.10, 0.16, 0.24 
and 0.36, respectively. The importance factor is 1.0 for ordinary buildings and 
1.5 for important buildings such as hospitals. The approximate time period for￾mulae are given for various types of buildings. A base shear correction is applied 6 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
if the computed base shear corresponding to dynamically calculated time period 
is less than the base shear obtained by using approximate time period formulae 
given in the code. The response reduction factor accounts for overstrength and 
ductility in the system. The value of response reduction factor ranges from 1.5 
(for un-reinforced masonry) to 5.0 (for ductile RC structures). Indian code allows 
(i) equivalent static method, which is allowed only when the time period does not 
exceed 0.4 s, (ii) dynamic response spectrum method and (iii) dynamic time his￾tory analysis method.
The base shear (Vb
) is given by Eq. (1.3.2):

building and W is seismic weight of the building. The approximate time period is 
given as

1.3.3  Other International Codes
A comparative analysis of codes of some countries is presented in Table 1.2.
For capacity design, EC-8 stipulates that the sum of moment capacities of columns 
meeting at joint should be not less than 1.3 times that from beams meeting at the joint 
in the direction under consideration. The corresponding factor in IS 13920-2016 is 
1.4. In many countries, seismic zones are replaced by seismic intensity maps with 
seismic intensity contours. Modal response spectrum method, equivalent static load 
method and time history analysis methods are permitted by the New Zealand code. In 
IBC-2006, seismic zones are specified in terms of seismic intensity maps with inten￾sity contours.
1.4 EQUAL DISPLACEMENT PRINCIPLE
“Equal displacement principle” is an observed phenomenon and not a “principle” as 
such. This phenomenon has been observed from post-earthquake effects on buildings. 
The principle may be stated as: The displacement suffered by an infinitely strong 
elastic building is approximately equal to the displacement surfed by a real building Force-Based Design and its Limitations 7

 is the response reduction factor, R. So, we can write

Eq. (1.4.1) indicates that the response reduction factor is directly proportional to the 
ductility, which is valid for medium to long period structures only.
Note that we have considered an elasto-plastic behaviour of building (response 
curve remains flat horizontal after yielding). So, Eq. (1.4.1) is valid for medium to 
long period buildings with elasto-plastic behaviour only, as shown by dark lines 
(Figure 1.1).
1.5 EQUAL ENERGY PRINCIPLE
The equal displacement principle is obeyed by medium to long period buildings only. 
The short period buildings obey what is known as “equal energy principle”, which 
can be stated as: the strain energy stored by an infinitely strong elastic building under 
an earthquake is approximately equal to the energy dissipated by a real building with 
limited strength but with same initial stiffness under the same earthquake.
To understand this observation, let us consider Figure 1.2. The strain energy stored 
by the infinitely strong elastic building is given by the area of triangle OAD.
The energy dissipated by the real inelastic building is given by the trapezoidal area 
OBFG. By equal energy principle, the two areas are same.
Area OAD = area OBFG
Deducting common area of both, that is area OBCD, we can write,
Area of triangle ABC = area of rectangle DCFG.10 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures

Eq. (1.5.1) indicates that for short period structures, the response reduction factor is 
not directly proportional to ductility. To understand the two cases, we plot Eq. (1.4.1) 
and (1.5.1) in Figure 1.3. This figure shows that the response reduction factor is lower 
for short period structures for similar value of ductility.
1.6 CLASSIFICATION OF STRUCTURES BASED ON TIME PERIOD
The time period of a building indicates whether the building is stiff or flexible. 
Flexible buildings have a longer time period. An empirical formula for time period of 
building is given in Eq. (1.6.1).
T N = 10 (1.6.1)
where, T is time period in second and N is the number of stories in the building.
A very general, but not rigid, classification of buildings based on time periods is 
given below:
Zero period structures: T < 0.1 sec.
Such structures are very stiff and vibrate with the same acceleration as that of the 
ground.
Short period structures: 0.1 s < T < 0.55 sec. (these correspond to the horizontal part 
of spectrum in Indian code):
FIGURE 1.3 Response reduction factor based on ductility.12 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
Long period structures: T > 0.7 sec.
Long period structures are flexible in nature.
The zero-period structure vibrates with the ground frequency. As such, there is little 
chance of energy dissipation through hysteresis. So, the response reduction factor for 
such structures is taken as unity. In fact, R is a function of time period of structures.
1.7 STRENGTH–STIFFNESS DEPENDENCY
Before entering into the topic, let us refresh ourselves about the moment–curvature 
relationship. We start with the flexural equation given by Eq. (1.7.1):
EI
d y
dx
M 2
2 = (1.7.1a)
Or, EIφ = M (1.7.1b)
Or, φ = M
EI where, φ = d y
dx
2
2 is the curvature of beam elastic curve.
Here, E is modulus of elasticity, I is moment of inertia of section, M is bending 
moment and f is curvature.
A plot between M and φ (i.e., M vs. 
M
EI ) is called the moment–curvature diagram. 
Typically, M–φ diagram is nonlinear (Figure 1.4a), but it can be idealized to a bilinear 
curve as shown in Figure 1.4b.
In Figure 1.4, the variation of yield moment (My
) is shown with increasing per￾centage steel in a beam section. The beam sectional size is kept constant. As the steel 
percentage increases, the yield moment increases, but the yield curvature remains 
same for the given section. The yield curvature will change if section size is altered. 
The bilinearized M–φ diagram is shown in Figure 1.4b.
FIGURE 1.4 (a) M–φ diagram for a given RC section with varying percentage steel 
(b) bilinearized M–φ diagram (My
is yield moment, p is percentage steel).Force-Based Design and its Limitations 13
The code assumes that the stiffness is not affected by steel in the section. So, 
for a given section, the stiffness does not change with increase of percentage steel. 
Figure 1.5(a) shows that the slope of M–φ diagram is constant for different percentage 
steel for the given section. As a fall out of such codal assumption, the yield curvature 
takes different values for the same section, which is against the reality, as has been 
observed in the preceding paragraph. In reality, we have found that the yield curvature 
of a section does not change with strength (i.e. percentage steel) for the given section. 
If the yield curvature has to remain constant at different strengths, we get the diagram 
1.5b. In Figure 1.5b, the section assumes different stiffnesses (slopes of M–φ lines) 
for different strengths. This suggests that the stiffness varies directly as the strength 
of the section.
This shows that, in order to get actual stiffness of the section, one needs to calcu￾late the strength of the section. The computation of actual stiffness has been discussed 
in Section 4.3 of Chapter 4.
1.8 LIMITATIONS OF FORCE-BASED METHOD OF DESIGN
Force-based method of design considers force as the primary design parameter. The 
traditional codal design is force-based. The following are some of the criticisms 
against and limitations of this method of design (Priestley et al., 2007).
1. In general, structural design is carried out to prevent damage in the structure 
or to limit the damage to a desired level. However, force is not a good measure 
of damage; rather displacement is a direct measure of damage in the structural 
elements.
2. The design force (base shear) is computed based on initial elastic time period 
when the system is elastic. However, the actual design force is taken based 
on some perceived damage and ductility, which state cannot be captured by 
initial stiffness.
FIGURE 1.5 Moment–curvature relationship: (a) assumed by code (b) in reality.14 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
3. The response reduction factor considered in force-based codal method of 
design is controversial. The assumption that response reduction factor is con￾stant for a particular type of building is not correct. It may vary from building 
to building of the same class. The assumption that response reduction factor 
is equal to ductility is based on the model of elastic–perfectly plastic system. 
The real systems are different from this assumption. The R = µ proposition is 
valid for medium period structures. For a short period, structures equal energy 
principle is valid, when
R = 2 1 µ − (1.5.1)
For zero period structures, R = 1 (regardless of the value of µ)
R = µ relationship is generally applicable when T > 0.7 sec.
For 0 to 0.7 sec time period, the suggested expression is given by (1.8.1):
R = +1 (µ −1)T / . 0 7 (1.8.1)
Thus, R is a period dependent parameter, which aspect is generally ignored 
in the codal method of design.
4. Code assumes that stiffness is independent of strength, but actually it is not so; 
stiffness varies with strength, as has been discussed in Section 1.7.
5. Design carried out with the initial time period to compute base shear often 
leads to building unsafe in drift. Hence an iterative solution is required, which 
takes time.
6. The analysis procedure that considers the effect of first mode may lead to 
inaccuracy because of ignoring higher mode effects.
7. Design carried out with response reduction factors underestimates the tor￾sional effects.
1.9 CLOSURE
In the traditional codal design method, force is at core criterion of design. The problem 
with this method is that the damage cannot be quantified from force. Other limitations 
of the FBD have also been highlighted here. The failure of structures under strong 
ground motions designed by using codes points to the fact that FBD is not a very 
reliable design philosophy. A more rational method would be to take displacement as 
the core parameter in design. It is a reality that stiffness varies with strength, but this 
is ignored in traditional design codes. Here arises the need for displacement-based 
design, which has been taken up in the subsequent chapters.

2 Introduction to 
Performance￾Based Design
2.1 GENERAL
We have seen in Chapter 1 that the FBD cannot always render a safe structure under 
a severe seismic event. Design codes of various countries prescribe the design 
procedures for earthquake-resistant design (ERD). But the structures designed 
following such codes are not always safe under seismic loads. Structures collapse or 
severely get damaged all over the world due to major earthquakes (see Chapter 1). 
This points to the limitations of present codal method of design, which lays emphasis 
on force alone as the design parameter. With time, the limitations of codal method of 
FBD has become apparent to the engineering community. From 1975 onwards, the 
concept of performance-based design (PBD) has gradually evolved. In this design 
philosophy, the structure is designed for some target performance objectives under an 
expected hazard level. Displacement, rather than the force, is the guiding parameter 
in this method of design. Performance objectives may include structural perform￾ance level, which depends on plastic rotation and, non-structural performance level in 
terms of damage and loss of functionality. Drift is an important design objective for 
many structures and non-structural components.
The intuitive application of earthquake resistance in structures may date long back 
in history. The scientific treatment of the earthquake resistance in structures started 
with the occurrence of some major earthquakes in modern times like the 1885 Edo 
earthquake (Ms
 = 7.0, Japan), 1906 San Francisco earthquake (Mw = 7.9, California, 
United States), 1908 Messina earthquake (Mw = 7.1, Italy) and 1923 Kanto earth￾quake (Mw = 8.2, Japan).
In this book, the performance-based seismic design (PBSD; often written as PBD 
in this book) of various structures has been dealt upon. The other name assigned 
by some authors is performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE). The 
performance-based concept can be applied in other engineering and non-engineering 
fields as well.
The first tall building designed using PBD approach is the 55-storied high office 
tower, Torre Mayor. For seismic mitigation, viscous dampers were used in this 
building. Presently, some countries have partly incorporated PBD in the design codes.
2.2 HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF PBD
The concept of PBD first appeared in the form of capacity spectrum method (CSM) 
introduced by Freeman et al. (1975) as an evaluation procedure in a pilot project for 
seismic vulnerability assessment of buildings. However, the root of the technique lies 18 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
in the “reserve energy technique” of Blume (Blume et al., 1961). Freeman (1978) 
improved the technique further. ATC-3-06 (1978) did place the PBD on a quantifiable 
footing. PBD can be applied to other fields as well like fire engineering and aerospace 
engineering. It was first applied in the field of earthquake engineering.
CSM was given a formal shape in ATC-40 (1996). This document gave a graphical 
construction method for getting the performance point. Performance point is the spe￾cial point where the capacity of the structure is equal to the reduced demand imposed 
on the structure. The graphical method of CSM became very helpful to engineers 
in visually understanding the structural dynamic behaviour. ATC-40 prescribes the 
building performance levels as a combination of structural and non-structural per￾formance levels. The acceptance criteria for component performance levels in terms 
of plastic rotations are given in FEMA-273 with NEHRP (National Earthquake 
Hazard Reduction Program) guidelines for rehabilitations of buildings (1997). This 
document, in parallel with ATC-40, gave the definition of building performance levels 
and acceptance criteria for member performance levels. In FEMA-356 (2000) docu￾ment, the coefficient method was proposed for estimating the target displacement, 
considering the inelasticity, MDOF effect and P-delta effect. The demand capacity 
ratio was also discussed in this treatise. Kilar and Fajfar (1997) reported pushover 
analysis for asymmetric building.
A chronological development of PBD is shown in Table 2.1.
2.3 DISPLACEMENT-BASED DESIGN
In 1991, Qi and Moehle reported a displacement-based design (DBD) method for 
structures. Here, the preliminary design is done by using elastic spectra. The interstory 
drift is found from an established equation. The design displacement response spec￾trum is then modified for the drift requirement. The time period is now established. If 
the time period becomes greater than the characteristic time period, then the design 
was acceptable, else steps are repeated.
The Blue book (1999), developed by Structural Engineers’ Association of Canada 
(SEAOC), described a DBD methodology. The target displacement was determined 
from target drift and assumed deflected shape, which method has been used by 
developers too. The effective period is obtained from ADRS representation of the 
pushover curve. From the calculated ductility, the effective stiffness was found out. 
From this, the base shear was computed. Panagiatakos and Fardis (1999) developed a 
deformation-based design methodology. The structural analysis for earthquake loads 
was done with uncracked sections and then capacity design was applied. The method 
focused only on limited safety criteria and could not accommodate the safety of non￾structural components.
Browning (2001) reported a design method which was called the “Browning’s 
proportioning method”. From a specified relationship between drift and building 
period, a target period was established. The preliminary member sizes were now 
decided. If the target time period was not achieved, iterations are carried out. If the 
base shear turns out to be greater than the yield base shear, the strength of members 
had to be increased.Introduction to Performance-Based Design 19
Medhekar and Kennedy (2001) reported a DBD method based on the displacement 
spectrum where an initial deflected shape was assumed. Vamvastikos and Cornel 
(2002) reported incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) where the structure is subjected 
to nonlinear time history analysis under several scaled ground motions. Antoniou and 
Pinho (2004) reported an adaptive pushover method for displacement-based design. 
In this method, the applied lateral load was updated at each stage of the change of 
stiffness keeping in line with the new displacement profile. This is supposed to be 
more realistic than the normal pushover method with constant pattern load.

2.4 DEFORMATION-CONTROLLED DESIGN BY PANAGIATAKOS 
AND FARDIS
Panagiatakos and Fardis (1999) proposed a method of seismic design aimed at con￾trolling the deformation. The authors recommended provisions for infill buildings. 
The steps involved in the design method are generally as follows:
(i) Elastic analysis using response spectrum at frequent earthquake level is 
carried out. The sections of elements are considered as uncracked.
(ii) Capacity design is carried out and proportioning of steel at hinge loca￾tion is done. Proportioning of steel in other parts of the structure is then 
carried out.
(iii) Elastic analysis for maximum earthquake is carried out. Secant stiffness is 
used at this stage.
(iv) From time history analysis, the amplifications of chord rotations are 
obtained.
(v) Check if chord rotations are within acceptable limits. If needed, modify the 
steels.
(vi) Capacity design is to be checked once again.
The method is silent on non-structural damage and safety.
2.5 DISPLACEMENT-BASED DESIGN BY QI AND MOEHLE

displacement is given by Eq. (2.5.1).

2.6 BROWNING’S PROPORTIONING METHOD OF DESIGN
Browning (1999) proposed the proportioning method as a DBD. This method 
considers drift as the target criterion, which was supposed to be reflected by a target 
time period (T
target).
The general steps are:
(1) Select the target time period (T
target) from target drift limit and displacement 
spectra corresponding to the design spectrum.
(2) Decide the member sizes. This is called proportioning.
(3) Carry out dynamic analysis to find dynamic initial time period of the structure 
(Tinitial). In this stage, gross sectional properties are used.
(4) If T T initial target
≤ , increase the member sizes.
(5) Check if base shear is greater than the lateral capacity of the building. If so, 
increase the strength by adding steel to those members that suffer damage.
(6) Apply capacity design so that beams yield and not columns.
(7) Apply ductile detailing as per standard specifications.
2.7 YIELD POINT SPECTRA METHOD OF DESIGN
Aschheim and Black (2000) proposed the yield point spectra (YPS) method of design. 
Here, the yield displacement is the core design parameter. The authors claimed that 
the yield displacement was more dependable property than the traditional time period 
of code-based design. The yield point spectra (YPS) is a plot between yield displace￾ment and yield strength coefficient (Cy ). The yield strength coefficient is the ratio 
of the yield strength to total gravity load for a nonlinear oscillator. Whereas normal 
elastic response spectrum is drawn for a single degree of freedom system (oscillator) 
having varying time period, the YPS is drawn for an oscillator that yields. The dis￾placement ductility of the oscillator is kept constant. The radial lines in an YPS plot 
indicate the constant period lines. Several curves are drawn for varying ductilities. 
Ductility is obtained from the consideration of limiting structural damage and drift. 
Equivalent single degree of freedom (ESDOF) system properties are obtained using 
participation factor and mass participation ratio. From the YPS plot, corresponding 
to the yield displacement and ductility, yield strength coefficient is read out. Yield 
base shear is given by the product of yield strength coefficient and mass participation 
ratio. The base shear is distributed over the height of the building as usual and design 
is carried out.
In fact, YPS is a plot between yield displacement (∆y
) and inelastic yield strength 
coefficient (Cy ). A typical YPS is shown in Figure 2.1. The steps involved are as 
follows:
(1) Select design drift and design spectrum.
(2) Construct the YPS corresponding to the perceived seismicity level. This con￾struct will involve plot of ∆y
 vs. Cy for various displacement ductilities.
(3) Compute design displacement (∆d
) corresponding to the design drift.
(4) Arrive at ductility demand and see where it fits in the YPS plot.22 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
(5) Compute yield displacement (∆y
) and from YPS find Cy
 and hence Fy
.
(6) Design for Fy (as per code of the region).
2.8 DBD BY CHOPRA
Chopra and Goel (2001) proposed a displacement-based design. Referring to 
Figure 2.2, the system has a height of H, yield displacement ∆y
, design displacement 
∆d
, plastic rotation at base is θ p
, Eqs. (2.8.1) to (2.8.3) are readily obtained. The dis￾placement ductility is given by Eq. (2.8.4). The method uses effective stiffness in 
analysis.
∆y = θ yH (2.8.1)
∆p = θ pH (2.8.2)
∆ ∆ ∆ d y p = + (2.8.3)
µ ∆ = ∆ ∆ d y / (2.8.4)

π (2.8.5)
The design steps are as follows:
(1) Find yield displacement. Decide the tolerable value of plastic rotation at 
the base of the system. Find the displacement ductility as per Eqs. (2.8.1) to 
(2.8.4). Construct the inelastic spectra for an yielding oscillator.
(2) From the displacement spectra and ductility, read out an effective time 
period (Te
).
(3) Find stiffness k from Eq. (2.8.5).
(4) Find the design yield force F k y y = ∆ . Design members for this lateral force 
(base shear).
(5) For the structure in step (4), find the actual updated stiffness (kupdate) and actual 
yield displacement (∆y update , ).
(6) Check if ∆ ∆ y y update ≈ , (i.e., approximately equal). If not, go to step 1. Else, 
accept the design.
2.9 CAPACITY SPECTRUM METHOD BY FREEMAN
Freeman proposed the capacity spectrum method (CSM) in 1975, which was further 
refined by Freeman (1998). The CSM is specially oriented for evaluating existing 
buildings for which the member sizes and strengths are known. As such, there are 
some gaps as to how the method to be applied to new buildings. The general steps 
are as follows:
(1) It is assumed that the building member sizes and member strengths are 
known. The capacity curve is generated between the roof displacement and 
base shear.
(2) The 5% damped demand spectrum is considered (T vs. Sa
). The capacity dia￾gram and demand diagram are converted to an acceleration–displacement 
format (ADRS format).
(3) Select assumed performance point.
(4) Find damping/ductility associated with the assumed performance point.
(5) Obtain the reduced demand diagram by using reduction factor. Currently, the 
following formula for reduction factor is in use. Note the point where the 
reduced demand curve intersects the capacity curve. If the originally assumed 
performance point differs from the newly obtained one, select another trial 
performance point between the above two points.
(6) The process is repeated till satisfactory convergence.
(7) The spectral displacement at the final performance point is the design 
displacement.
(8) Base shear is the product of stiffness and design displacement.
(9) Design is done for this base shear.24 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
A typical CSM scheme is shown in Figure 2.3.
More discussion on CSM is available in Chapter 6.
2.10 DIRECT DISPLACEMENT-BASED DESIGN
Priestley (1993) formulated a direct displacement-based design (DDBD), which was 
improved over the years (Priestley 1993; Priestley 2000; Priestley 2003a; Priestley 
2003b, Priestley et al. 2007). In the context of building, the method involved 
assumption of a first mode shape and an equivalent SDOF (ESDOF) system for the 
MDOF building. ESDOF system properties are found from the assumed displacement 
profile and known masses of the floors. The effective time period is obtained from 
the secant stiffness connecting the origin and the point of design displacement, using 
displacement spectra corresponding to the effective damping. Yield displacement is 
guided by beam depth and yield strain of steel. The design base shear is obtained from 
design displacement and effective time period. The base shear is distributed suitably 
over the height of the building and design is carried out with expected strength. The 
detailed treatment of the method will be done in Chapter 7.
Xue (2001, 2003) reported a DDBD procedure of inelastic structures, which 
satisfied displacement/drift requirements. Inelastic spectra were utilized with 
Newmark–Hall reduction factor. An SDOF replacement of structure was necessary. 
The performance point is determined from displayed ductility. Pettinga and Priestley 
(2005) developed a DDBD for frame buildings. Sullivan et al. (2005, 2006a, 2006b) 
developed DDBD method for frame-wall dual system. In this method, the base shear 
is apportioned between the frame and wall. The yield displacements of walls are 
found out from suggested equations. Ductility of the frame and the wall are found 
out. Effective dampings for wall and frame are obtained and effective time period is 
calculated. The design base shear is now computed. The base shear is now distributed 
suitably over the height of the building. If necessary, steps are repeated to achieve 
FIGURE 2.3 Capacity spectrum diagram.Introduction to Performance-Based Design 25
the design interstory drift. A detailed treatment of DDBD for dual system is done in 
Chapter 8.
The interstory drift requirement is checked through nonlinear time history analysis 
(NLTHA) and if necessary, redesign is done. The DDBD method considers interstory 
drift as the only design criterion.
2.11 UNIFIED PERFORMANCE-BASED DESIGN
Unified performance-based design (UPBD) was introduced by Choudhury (2008)
and applied to RC frame-wall buildings of IO performance level. While DBD and 
DDBD methods considered only drift as the target design objective, UPBD method 
considered both drift and performance level in the design philosophy. The advantage 
of the UPBD method over other methods of PBD are: (i) it accommodates two target 
performance criteria, namely, drift and performance level (in terms of plastic rotation) 
and (ii) it gives member sizes of the yielding members in the beginning of the design, 
thus avoiding iteration for member sizes. Choudhury and Singh (2013) developed 
UPBD method for RC frame buildings. The determination of column size in UPBD 
framework was treated by Mayengbam and Choudhury (2014). UPBD method has 
been applied to steel frame buildings (Kotapaty, 2015; Anil, 2021; Azeel, 2022). The 
UPBD method for RC bridge pier was developed by Banerjee and Choudhury (2020a, 
2020b). The UPBD method has been applied to dual system with various perform￾ance levels and drifts by Mibang and Choudhury (2019a, 2019b).
The UPBD method for various structures has been discussed in separate chapters 
in this book.
2.12 CAPACITY DESIGN
The concept of capacity design was developed by Park and Paulay (1975). The need 
for capacity design arose from the understanding that the failure of different members 
had different impact on the health of the structure. Failure of some members are more 
critical to the structure. Also, the hysteretic energy dissipation in different types of 
failure are different. Capacity design implies designing structural components with 
such strength allocations that failure of some members is allowed while failure of 
some other members is prevented. The failure in flexure is gradual in nature and it 
allows large inelastic deformation without collapse, thus, dissipating energy through 
hysteresis, cycle after cycle. On the contrary, the failure in shear is sudden and inher￾ently brittle in nature, accompanied with very little energy dissipation through hyster￾esis. It is judicious that shear failure of the members is avoided and flexural failure is 
encouraged. The failure of columns is generally through bulging of longitudinal steel 
following the snapping of confining ties. This type of failure is known as bursting 
failure, which is essentially sudden and brittle in nature. Columns are also the primary 
gravity load-carrying members. Failure of columns may easily lead to the collapse of 
structure, through progressive collapse. If one column fails, the load carried by the 
column is now shared by the adjacent columns, which in turn become overloaded. 
This process may continue and the columns may fail progressively. To avoid such 26 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
situation, the columns are imparted relatively higher strength over beams meeting at a 
joint so that the beams may fail earlier than the columns. This is known as weak-beam 
strong-column concept.
Unless capacity design is done, the pushover results and time history results are not 
reliable, as undesirable hinge pattern may develop (Choudhury, 2008). In such situ￾ation even, the analysis may not progress due to non-convergence. Mathematically, 
we can express the capacity design requirement by Eq. (2.12.1).
Capacity of non-yielding member
Capacity of yielding member = > ψ 1 0. (2.12.1)
In the context of buildings, in a beam–column joint we need to observe:

∑

1 4. as per IS 13920 2016 (2.12.3)
In Eqs. (2.12.2) and (2.12.3), ∑ Mc
 is sum of limiting moment capacities of columns 
meeting in the joint in a particular direction, and, ∑ Mb
 is the sum of limiting moment 
capacities of beams meeting in the joint in the same direction. Limiting moment cap￾acity here means the limit state moment of resistance. As such, the Eqs. (2.12.2) and 
(2.12.3) give what is called “column-to-beam capacity ratio” (C/B ratio). Obviously, 
there shall be at least two C/B ratios in a particular joint, along the two major directions 
of orientation of the column. The requirement of C/B ratio limit need not be applied 
at the roof level, as there is no column above the roof.
2.13 EQUIVALENT VISCOUS DAMPING
In a simplified way, the equivalent viscous damping (ξe
) is the sum of material 
damping (ξ m) and hysteretic damping (ξ h
), as given by Eq (2.13.1a). It is a simpli￾fied statement because there can be added damping (ξ a
) from deliberately introduced 
energy dissipation devices (Eq. (2.13.1b)). Typically, material damping for concrete 
is 5% and that of steel is 2% of critical damping.
ξ ξ ξ e m h = + (2.13.1a)
ξ ξ ξ ξ e m h a = + + (2.13.1b)
Damping is physically related to ductility. More ductility will lead to more damping. 
Hysteretic damping takes place when the structural element undergoes plastic Introduction to Performance-Based Design 27
deformation under reversible actions. The force–deformation diagram is called the 
hysteresis loop. The area under the loop gives the energy dissipated though hysteresis. 
In reversible action like earthquake, the hysteresis loops are formed again and again 
in each cycle, thereby dissipating energy absorbed from earthquake shaking. A typ￾ical hysteresis loop is shown in Figure 2.4.
The area of the hysteresis loop gives the energy dissipated through hysteresis. The 
area of the loop depends on the force applied and deformation that the section under￾goes. The force applied cannot exceed the capacity of the section. The deformation 
that the section can undergo depends on the ductility of the section. The more the duc￾tility more is the energy dissipation. Ductility arises out of detailing in RC structures 
and joint detailing in steel structures.
The expression for hysteretic damping is given by Eq. (2.13.2):

(2.13.2)
where ξ h
 is hysteretic damping, Ed is hysteretic energy dissipated per cycle in hyster￾esis and Es m, ax is maximum strain energy through structural displacement.
The shape of the hysteresis loop depends on the material type. The shape is also 
dictated by section behaviours obtained through experiments. We have Takeda model 
for RC sections and FEMA model for RC sections and steel sections. The other hys￾teresis behaviours are Ramberg–Oswgood model, bilinear idealized model and flag￾shaped model.

increasing steel. But steel is generally limited to 3–4% of column gross sectional area.

2.15 CLOSURE
In this chapter, a brief introduction has been given about PBSD. Detailed treatments 
are available in chapters to follow. The main points of focus in PBD can be expressed 
as: (i) deciding target design objectives and expected hazard level for the location of 
the structure and (ii) developing design process in PBD and evaluating the design 
product through nonlinear analyses. The analyses will reveal whether the targets have 
been reached or not. The analyses are to be carried out at MCE level. (iii) Implement 
the procedures in code framing for future world. The structure should be healthy to 
the extent that the economic loss following any major earthquake should be minimal.
The design should also consider multiple design objectives under various pos￾sible hazard levels. The hazard levels may be minor, moderate and major. These are 
understood in terms of the return periods. The societal, economic and hazardous 
consequences of failure should be kept in mind.
PBSD is a vast subject. Hence, the literature survey made here is far from com￾plete. Some references are given here; the readers may search for more materials in

Hazard Considerations
3.1 INTRODUCTION
In seismic design, hazard means the seismicity levels of ground motions. Ground 
motions are of two categories: (i) weak ground motions, which are of interest to the 
seismologists, and (ii) strong ground motions, which are of interest to the earthquake 
engineers and structural engineers. Whether the design is carried out with the codal 
prescriptive method or using PBD, hazard remains associated in the background. In 
fact, PBD is the design process accommodating target design criteria to be satisfied at 
any perceived hazard level. The codal design spectrum indicates some hazard level. 
The hazard level can be varied by using the seismic zone factor (as in Indian code) or 
through specifying design seismicity level in terms of g (as in Eurocode).
Seismic hazard has been defined by ASCE-SEI-41-17 as follows:
Seismic hazard caused by ground shaking shall be defined as acceleration 
response spectra or ground motion acceleration histories determined on either 
a probabilistic or deterministic basis.
Here, a refreshing the concept of response spectrum is relevant. Response spec￾trum is the graphical representation of some peak response quantity (such as peak 
displacement, peak velocity or peak acceleration) of a series of single degree of 
freedom systems (also called oscillators) of varying time periods with a particular 
damping under a given earthquake. According to the peak response quantity chosen, 
the response spectrum may be a displacement response spectrum, velocity response 
spectrum or acceleration response spectrum. The response spectra vary with the 
earthquakes. Again, for a given earthquake, the response spectra will be different 
for different dampings values associated with the single degree of freedom system. 
Typically, response spectrum is constructed for 5% damped elastic response. If the 
oscillator is taken inelastic (that is, it yields), the resultant response spectrum will be 
called inelastic response spectrum. The velocity response spectrum is more zig-zag 
in nature than the corresponding displacement response spectrum and, acceleration 
response spectrum is more zig-zag in nature than the velocity response spectrum. 
A typical acceleration response spectrum is shown in Figure 3.1
It is to be noted that the acceleration response spectrum is of more relevance in 
design. In the response spectrum, we do not represent actual acceleration response 
3Hazard Considerations 37
but pseudo-acceleration response, or spectral acceleration, denoted by Sa
. The spec￾tral velocity is denoted by Sv
 and spectral displacement is denoted by Sd . The spectral 
acceleration and spectral displacement are related by Eq. (3.1.1). This equation we 
use in displacement-based design for the construction of displacement spectra from 
design spectrum is
S S a d = ω2 (3.1.1)
Design spectrum forms the basis for designing structures in a country. Design spec￾trum is generally a plot between time period and spectral acceleration ratio ( S g a / ). 
Design spectrum is the average smoothened curve for several response spectra (gen￾erally at 5% damping) generated from a host of real past earthquakes or artificially 
generated probable future earthquake for a country. The design spectrum will vary 
with soil type. In Indian code (IS 1893-2016, part 1), three spectra are given – for hard 
soil, medium soil and soft soil. Due to soil amplification, the design spectrum for soft 
soil has higher magnitude of spectral acceleration. The design spectrum is also called 
as 5% damped elastic demand curve.
Site spectrum is the response spectrum for a particular site. This is used for very 
important project or very important structures. Actually, the design spectrum given 
in the code of a country is the average representation of demand on structures. But it 
does not cover local variations in soil characteristics and seismicity. This may lead 
to unsafe structure even if designed through codal provisions. So, for important pro￾ject sites, the geological conditions, soil conditions, seismic hazard source locations 
(faults) etc. are studied meticulously and based on the data collected, a site-specific 
response spectrum is drawn. In most cases, the site-specific spectrum gives higher 
demand than the codal design spectrum. If demand from the site-specific spectrum 
FIGURE 3.1 Typical acceleration response spectra.38 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
is lower than that in the codal spectrum, codal demand spectrum is to be used. Site 
spectra are used for nuclear power projects, other important projects and for the 
projects the failure of which will lead to hazardous consequences.
3.2 NOMENCLATURE OF HAZARD LEVELS
The hazard levels have been designated in FEMA documents and different national 
codes based on the mean return period or probability of exceedance. Considering the 
life span of structure as 50 years, the probability of exceedance of an earthquake as 
p% is denoted by p%/50 year. This has an associated mean return period. It may be 
noted that the return period is an approximate proposition valid when there is one or 
two sources (fault) of earthquakes at a site. However, this phrase has long been used 
and may be passed for a qualitative description of the probable return period.
Serviceability earthquake (SE) is that level of hazard which has 50% chance of 
exceedance in 50 years (50%/50 year). This is frequent earthquake that is likely 
to occur during the life of the structure. It has mean return period of 75 years.
Design earthquake (DE) is that level of hazard which has a 10% chance of 
exceedance in 50 years (10%/50 year). This is infrequent earthquake that is 
likely to occur during the life of the structure. It has a mean return period of 
500 years. It may be noted that BSE-1 of FEMA-273 and FEMA-356 corres￾ponds to DE of ATC-40.
Maximum earthquake (ME) is that level of hazard which has 5% chance of 
exceedance in 50 years (5%/50 year). This is infrequent earthquake that may 
damage the structure. This definition has no parallel in FEMA-273 and FEMA￾356 documents.
FEMA-273 and FEMA-356 have defined Basic Safety Earthquake-1 (BSE-1) as 
10%/50 year.
The hazard nomenclature as per various documents are tabulated in Table 3.1.

3.3 HAZARD CONSIDERATION IN ATC-40 (1996)
ATC-40 classified hazard as serviceability earthquake (SE), design earthquake (DE) 
and maximum earthquake (ME). ME has been named as maximum capable earth￾quake (MCE) in some documents. It may be noted that SE = 0.5 × DE and ME = 1.25 
× DE to 1.5 × DE. The soil categories are classified as: hard rock, rock, very dense 
soil and soft rock, for which standard penetration test (SPT) number is greater than 
50; stiff soil (SPT between 15 and 50) and soft soil (SPT less than 15). The categories 
of soil also have corresponding shear wave velocities. Some soil may require site soil 
investigation.
In ATC-40, the elastic response spectrum is given in terms of two coefficients CA
and CV, as described in Eqs. (3.3.1) and (3.3.2). The coefficient CA
 represents effective 
peak ground acceleration.
C S A MS = 0 4. (3.3.1)
C S V M = 1 (3.3.2)
where SMS is the spectral acceleration ratio in the short period range for site class B 
for MCE (BSSC 1996) and SM1
 is the spectral acceleration at 1.0 second for site class 
B for MCE (BSSC 1996).
The values of CA
 and CV are given in ATC-40. The value of CA varies from 0.08 to 
1.0 depending on the shaking intensity, which is proportional to the shaking intensity. 
The value of CV varies from 0.08 to 2.4 depending on the shaking intensity.
The general shape of elastic response spectrum as per ATC-40 is shown in 
Figure 3.2.
3.4 HAZARD DESCRIPTION IN ASCE-SEI-7-16
3.4.1 Seismic Risk Categories
ASCE-7-16 deals with the design loads including seismic loads. The buildings have 
been categorized into A, B, C and D and the anticipated risk categories are I to IV. 
FIGURE 3.2 General elastic 5% damped response spectrum as per ATC-40 (schematic).40 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
The risk categories are: (i) risk category I – low-risk buildings and other structures, 
(ii) risk category II – buildings and other structures not belonging to I, III and IV 
categories, (iii) risk category III – high-risk buildings and other structures, (iv) risk 
category IV – very high-risk buildings and other structures designated as essential 
facilities.
3.4.2 Seismic Design Category
The seismic design category of buildings or site classes are A, B, C and D. Seismic 
design categories are decided based on the spectral acceleration at short period (SDS) 
and 1 second period (SD1).
The design response spectrum as per ASCE-7-16 is schematically shown in 
Figure 3.3. The parameters involved in the process are described below in Eqs. (3.4.1) 
to (3.4.4).

3.6 HAZARD DESCRIPTION IN EURO CODE 8 (2004)
3.6.1  Ground Types
Ground types are subdivided as Type A (rock or other rock-like soil), B (very dense 
sand, gravel or very stiff clay), C (deep dense or medium-dense sand, gravel or stiff 
clay), D (dense to medium cohesionless soil), E (alluvium layer), S1
 (soft clay/silt) 
and S2
 (liquefiable soil). There are corresponding shear wave velocity and SPT related 
to each category.

The numerical values of the parameters are to be found in the code.
3.7 HAZARD DESCRIPTION IN IS 1893 (PT 1) – 2016
Indian Standard IS 1893 (Pt 1) – 2016 has considered four seismic zones in India, 
namely, Zone II, Zone III, Zone IV and Zone V, in the increasing order of seismicity. 
Zone I is missing as it was merged with Zone II earlier. The design spectra are given 
in two categories: (i) for use in equivalent static load method and (ii) response spec￾trum method. The first one is applicable in limited cases only – namely, building with 
time period not exceeding 0.4 s. The second method is applicable to all cases. The two 
categories of design spectrum are given in mathematical expressions for rocky of hard 
soil, for medium soil and soft soil. The two spectra drawn in excel using expressions 
of the code are shown in Figures 3.6 and 3.7.
The base shear is given by Eq. (3.7.1):
V
Z I
R
S
g b Wa = 2 (3.7.1)
where Vb
 is the base shear, Z is the zone factor (values are 0.10, 0.16, 0.24 and 0.36 
for four zones), I is the important factor, R is response reduction factor, Sa is spectral 
acceleration, g i s acceleration due to gravity and W is seismic weight.
FIGURE 3.6 Schematic design spectrum as per IS 1893 (Pt 1)-2016 for equivalent static 
method.44 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
3.8 NEW ZEALAND CODE: NZS 1170-5 (2004)
The New Zealand code considers two limit states to be satisfied in the design: the 
serviceability limit states and ultimate limit states. Ultimate limit state corresponds 
to probability of fatality as 10–6
 in the collapse of a building. The code gives seismic 
design spectra for equivalent static method and response spectrum method (so also 
for time history analysis) separately. The spectra are given for strong rock (soil class 
A), rock (soil class B) shallow soil (soil class C), deep or soft soil (soil type D) and 
very soft soil (soil class E) soil. The design spectra are given in log-log scale. A sche￾matic diagram of the New Zealand design spectra is shown in Figure 3.8.
3.9 CONSTRUCTION OF DISPLACEMENT RESPONSE SPECTRA
In DBD and PBD, displacement response spectra are used instead of acceleration 
spectra. The acceleration spectra of code are converted to displacement spectra for 
various dampings.
The acceleration spectra in codes are given for 5% damping in elastic condition. 
The acceleration spectra at other damping are obtained from Eq. (3.9.1). Here, Sa
 is 
spectral acceleration, ξ is critical damping ratio.

The conversion of acceleration spectra to displacement spectra is carried out by using 
Eq. (3.9.2). In this equation, Sd is spectral displacement. Note that in the conversion, 
the acceleration axis becomes spectral displacement axis. The T-axis does not change.

Using Eqs. (3.9.1) and (3.9.2), the displacement spectra for EC-8 for 5% damping for 
B type soil at various seismicity level is shown in Figure 3.9. For a particular seismi￾city level (0.45g), the displacement spectra for EC-8 for various dampings are shown 
in Figure 3.10.
The spectral reduction factor, which is to be applied for getting acceleration 
spectra or displacement spectra, is be given by Eq. (3.9.3) (EC-8). In Eq. (3.9.3), ξ is

3.9.1 Steps in the Construction of Displacement Spectra
The steps involved in the generation of displacement spectra are as follows:
(1) Select the design spectrum for which the displacement spectra to be developed. 
Such design spectrum is developed in terms of time period (T) and spectral 
acceleration ratio (S g a / ).
FIGURE 3.10 EC-8 displacement spectra at 0.45g level for various dampings.
FIGURE 3.9 Displacement spectra for EC-8 at 5% damping and various seismicity levels.Hazard Considerations 47
(2) Use the relationship S T S d a = 2

 to get spectral displacement (Sd ) for each 
value of spectral acceleration (Sa ) for a given T.
(3) Plot the displacement spectrum with x-axis as T and y-axis as Sd . This 
completes the displacement spectrum at 5% damping.

3.10 CLOSURE
Hazard analysis is a primary requirement in seismic design. The hazard analysis may 
be deterministic or probabilistic. For seismic hazard analysis, the readers may refer 
books on geotechnical earthquake engineering. True hazard analysis involves the 
study of geology, seismology and geotechnical earthquake engineering. A basic idea 
about hazard is presented in this chapter. HAZUS (Hazard US) may be consulted for 
more details.

Modelling Aspects
4.1 INTRODUCTION
It is difficult to exactly replicate a real structure in a computer model. Some sim￾plifying assumptions are made to make a viable model of the prototype structure. 
The model should be able to capture the behaviour of real structure as realistically 
as possible. Modelling is necessary for (i) analysis and design and (ii) evaluation of 
the designed structure. Evaluation may involve (a) elastic response and (b) inelastic 
response. Inelastic model is also called the nonlinear model. Nonlinearity may 
arise out of (a) material nonlinearity (response beyond elastic limit of the material), 
(b) geometric nonlinearity (mostly P-delta effect and large deflection) and (c) non￾linearity due to contact and boundary. Material nonlinearity occurs due to yielding of 
material and subsequent formation of plastic condition in sections of elements of the 
structure, either partly or fully. In this chapter, we discuss various aspects of nonlinear 
modelling.
An analysis is said to be nonlinear when the relationship between the applied 
action and response (displacement) is nonlinear. In solid mechanics, nonlinearity 
means a nonlinear relationship between stress and strain. Any material will undergo 
yielding when sufficient force is applied in the section. This will lead to material non￾linearity. Material nonlinearity, however, is not restricted to yielding only. Creep and 
visco-plasticity also will lead to material nonlinearity. Various nonlinear effects may 
occur in combination also. Material nonlinearity will make change in stiffness. With 
increase of nonlinearity, the stiffness reduces. Contact nonlinearity is demonstrated 
by friction devices.
Geometric nonlinearity involves large deformation or large strains. If the magni￾tude of the deformation is such that it alters the response of the structure, it is a case of 
geometric nonlinearity. P-delta effect is a typical example of geometric nonlinearity. 
Nonlinear analysis needs to go step by step as the stiffness or deformation will change 
every time.
Nonlinear analysis may be dynamic when the applied force is time-dependent; or 
it may be static nonlinear analysis when the applied force is static, but changes from 
step to step. Nonlinear time history analysis (NLTHA) can be performed by various 
methods like the Newmark method, Wilson’s method, Hilber–Hughes method, 
452 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
collocation method and Chung-Hulbert method. Nonlinear static analysis is also 
popularly known as “pushover analysis” (POA).
4.2 STRENGTH LEVELS
Construction materials like concrete, rebar and structural steel are designated in terms 
of their strengths. Strength used in such definition is called nominal strength. Generally, 
materials are designated in terms of their characteristic strength. Inherently, material 
strengths are probabilistic in nature. Material strength is determined by laboratory 
testing. It is a natural phenomenon that in every test result, the strength is different 
with some amount of variation. One may take the average value of the strengths, but 
then one also needs to know the dispersion of the result reflected by the standard devi￾ation of the results. The standard deviation σ is given by Eq. (4.2.1) when sample size 
is limited and by Eq. (4.2.2) when the sample size is large. In these two formulae, µ
is mean value of the data and xi
 is i-th observed data and N is the number of data. The 
mean value (or expected value) is given by Eq. (4.2.3). The square of standard devi￾ation σ2 is called variance.

4.2.1  Characteristic Strength
The nominal strength by which the material is designated is called the characteristic 
strength. A formal definition is: characteristic strength is the strength below which 
not more than 5% of the test results are likely to fall. Characteristic strength, in gen￾eral, may be designated by the symbol f
k .
To understand the meaning of the term, we take the help of the probability density 
function (PDF) for normal distribution given by Eq. (4.2.1.1).
Probability density function of a continuous random variable is a function whose 
value at any given sample in the sample space gives likelihood that the random vari￾able would equal that sample.Modelling Aspects 53

(4.2.1.2)
where x is any data value, µ is mean value and σ is the standard deviation of 
data set.
The plot of a PDF is parabolic as shown in Figure 4.1. The area under the parabolic 
curve is unity or 100%. As shown in Figure 4.1(a), 50% of the area corresponds to the 
highest value of PDF at the centre. This point corresponds to mean value of the data. 
It may be noted that in probability curves in Figure 4.1, there is no strength axis. The 
probability curve gives the probability of occurrence of a value. It is our convenience 
as to how we define strengths based on the probability of its occurrence (or degree of 
confidence).
In Figure 4.1(b) the 5% probability point is the 5% area (shaded) on the left of 
the point. Corresponding to this point, the strength level is the called characteristic 
strength. The characteristic strength of concrete is given by f
ck (notation in India) and 
characteristic strength of rebar steel is given by f
y (yield strength).
FIGURE 4.1 Probability density function plot.54 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
As mentioned, the characteristic strength is used for nominal designation of 
materials. So, the basic strength is characteristic strength. Other strengths are 
obtained from this strength by adding the statistical distances from characteristic 
strength point.
4.2.2  Limit Strength
Limit strength or limiting strength is the design level strength described by the 
design code. Limit strength ( f ) lim is obtained by dividing the characteristic 
strength by partial safety factor of material (γ ) m and is given by Eq. (4.2.2.1). 
In Indian code (IS 456-2000), partial safety factor for concrete is 1.5 and that for 
rebar it is 1.15.
f f lim k m = /γ (4.2.2.1)
Using the limiting strength of concrete and rebar, we can compute the limiting 
moment of resistance of a section.
4.2.3  Expected Strength
Expected strength is also known as mean strength. It is the mean value of test data. 
It may be defined as that strength below which not more than 50% of test results 
are expected to fall. In Figure 4.1(a), the middle point of PDF corresponds to this 
strength. Needless to say, 50% of test results are also expected to lie above the mean 
value. The horizontal axis of PDF plot is designated also in terms of standard devi￾ation as shown in Figure 4.1(d). The 5% area point is at a distance of 1.64 σ from the 
central line. So, to go to mean level point from characteristic level point, we have to 
travel a statistical distance of 1.64 σ . Thus, the expected strength ( f ) exp is related to 
the characteristic strength by Eq. (4.2.3.1). It may be noted that the 1 σ distance cor￾responds to 84 percentile value.
f f exp k = +1 64. σ (4.2.3.1)
The expected strength of concrete ( ) , f
c exp and that for rebar ( ) , f
s exp can now be 
expressed by Eqs. (4.2.3.2) and (4.2.3.3), respectively.
f f c,exp ck c = +1 6. 4σ (4.2.3.2)
f f s,exp y s = +1 6. 4σ (4.2.3.3)
where, σc is the standard deviation of concrete and σs is is standard deviation of 
steel. The standard deviation for particular concrete mix is available in IS 456 for Modelling Aspects 55
India, and concrete design codes of other countries. The standard deviation of rebar 
for all grades may be taken as 50 MPa.
The expected strength has great significance in PBSD as the design is damage￾based and nonlinear evaluation is also damage-based. So, in PBSD expected strength 
is used in design and nonlinear analysis.
4.2.4  Extreme Strength
Figure 4.1(c) gives a point at a statistical distance of 1.64(sigma) towards right from 
the mean position. This corresponds to the strength beyond which not more than 5% 
results are expected to lie. In other words, 95% of samples will have strength less that 
value which corresponds to this level. This is called extreme strength ( f
exteme ). It is 
clear that extreme strength level is at a statistical distance of 2 ×1 64. σ from the char￾acteristic strength level point. Thus, extreme level strength is given by Eq. (4.2.4.1). 
For concrete and rebar, the corresponding formulae are Eqs. (4.2.4.2) and (4.2.4.3), 
respectively.
f f exteme k = + 2 1 × 64. σ (4.2.4.1)
f f c,extreme ck c = + 2 1 × .64σ (4.2.4.2)
f f s,extreme y s = + 2 1 × .64σ (4.2.4.3)
The question of what is the utility of extreme strength may arise. In capacity design, 
this strength becomes useful. In capacity design, there is an yielding element and an 
elastic element. We wish that the yielding element only yields under high load but 
not the elastic element. This can be ensured if we set the condition as given in Eq. 
(4.2.4.4). When such condition is set, there is all likelihood that the yielding element 
will yield first.
Extreme strength of yielding element ≤ limiting strength of elastic element
(4.2.4.4)
4.2.5 Strength of Concrete
Strength of concrete is expressed by 28-day characteristic cube (15 cm cube) strength 
or 28-day characteristic cylinder strength. Cylinder strength is typically 80% of the 
cube strength due to buckling effect of length. European codes and US codes use 
cylinder strength whereas Indian code uses cube strength. But we have to remember 
that all strengths are obtained by laboratory tests. So, laboratory test conditions affect 
the test strength. Remember that when a concrete is used in a structure, it is in the 
site condition and laboratory conditions are no more available. A cube or a cylinder is 
pressed between two steel plattens driven hydraulically in the compression machine. 
The two steel plattens confine the test specimen. Such confinement effect increases 56 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
the test strength. In the site, there is no such confining effect and concrete is stressed 
by external actions in a free ambience. As such, the strength exhibited in the site is 
lower than that in the laboratory. Further, the size of the specimen also affects the 
compressive strength. This is called size effect. Together with platten effect and size 
effect, the laboratory test specimen shows higher strength, which not available in the 
site condition. Such discrepancy is adjusted by taking the site strength as two-third of 
that in the laboratory. This is given by Eq. (4.2.5.1).
Strength to be taken in design = 0.67 × cube strength (or cylinder strength)
(4.2.5.1)
Over and above, the partial safety factor for materials will apply.
4.2.6 Strength of Reinforcing Steel
Reinforcing steel bar (rebar) for reinforced concrete (RC) can be mild steel or high￾strength steel. The stress–strain characteristics of both are different. Mild steel shows 
specific yield point in the laboratory tensile test. Though there is a lower yield point 
and higher yield point with minor variation for mild steel, on a bilinearized stress–
strain curve, the yield point can be easily located (see Figure 4.2a). From the yield 
point, we get the yield strength.
High-strength steel, on the other hand, does not show any specific yield point. It 
follows some curved path. Through consensus, it is considered that the yield point 
is at the intersection of stress–strain curve and a straight line drawn at strain 0.002, 
parallel to the initial tangent curve (see Figure 4.2b). Since the stress–strain curve is 
nonlinear, the points in the curve must be supplied by the code. For Indian condition, 
SP.16 gives the stress–strain tables for various grades of steel.
Figure 4.3 shows the stress–strain curves for rebar at different strength levels.
FIGURE 4.2 Yield point of rebar: (a) mild steel and (b) high-strength steel.Modelling Aspects 57
4.2.7  Moment of Resistance Computation for Concrete Section
The moment of resistance (MR) for concrete section can be computed at different 
strength levels. As per IS 456-2000, the compressive strength offered by compression 
concrete at limiting level is given by Eq. (4.2.7.1). This expression has embedded 
partial safety factor for concrete as 1.5. So, the compression offered in character￾istic level is given by Eq. (4.2.7.2), with a multiplication factor 1.5. Similarly, for 
expected level Eq. (4.2.7.3) holds good and, for extreme strength level Eq. (4.2.7.4) is 
to be used. Here, x is neutral axis depth. The factor 0.36 has a component 0.67 and a 
parabolic-rectangular stress block in the background (as per IS 456). The factor 0.67 
should work with only f
ck and not its variational increment to other strength levels.

C f bx c,extreme ck c = × 15 03 . . 6 0( .67 + ×2 1.64σ ) (4.2.7.4)
The compression in compression steel (Cs ) is given by Eq. (4.2.7.5). Total com￾pression C is given by Eq. (4.2.7.6). The tension in tensile steel (T) is given by Eq. 
(4.2.7.7). For equilibrium of forces in the section, Eq. (4.2.7.8) works, which gives 
the unknown value of x. The value of x is to be assumed in the beginning and one 
needs to test if Eq. (4.2.7.8) is satisfied or not. Iteration may be required. Finally, 
moment of resistance is given by Eq. (4.2.7.9). Here, f
sc is stress in compression

Calculation of f
sc and f
st needs some effort. These are to be obtained by noting 
the strain level in the steel. If the strain level exceeds yield strain, the stresses are 
obtained as given in SP.16 for Indian case (values of stresses in nonlinear strain range 
for Fe415 (yield strength 415 MPa) and Fe500 (yield strength 500 MPa) steel). The 
yield strain of rebar (ε sy ) is given by Eq. (4.2.7.10). Here, f
sy is yield stress of steel 
at various strength levels as given below:
For limit strength, f f sy y = 0 87.
For characteristic strength, f f sy y =

FIGURE 4.4 Beam section and strain profile.
If ε st or ε sc is greater than ε y , then the corresponding steel has yielded, else not 
yielded. Once yielded, the stress is equal to yield strength of given level, else it is to 
be found from the tabular values of Table A of SP.16 (for Indian case). If the strain is 
less than elastic strain, the stress can be found from Hooke’s law of proportionality of 
stress–strain. Beam section and strain profile are shown in Figure 4.4.
4.3 EFFECTIVE STIFFNESS
Gross sectional stiffness refers to the condition when the full sizes (i.e. longer and 
shorter dimensions) of the cross-section of the member is used in computing stiffness. 
In RC members, due to tension developed below the neutral axis, full section is not 
available to render stiffness. This is for the reason that concrete is weak in tension 
and hence, it is neglected below the neutral axis. Thus, only a part of the gross section 
will be available in offering stiffness against some action. Such sections are called 
“cracked” section. In steel section, this problem does not arise, as steel is equally 
strong in tension and compression. We define effective stiffness factor (or effective 
stiffness ratio, or, stiffness reduction factor) by Eq. (4.3.1).

The development of tension in beam and column section is explained in Figure 4.5. 
Beam is generally under transverse bending; but a column can have uniaxial or biaxial 
bending. Further, column is under axial force, which helps the concrete to be in com￾pression. So, the stiffness reduction factor of column is higher (i.e. reduction is lower) 
than that of beam.60 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
The expressions of stiffness for various common actions are given in Eqs. (4.3.2). It 
is found from Eqs. (4.3.2) that in most of the cases EI (called flexural rigidity) term 
is common. Here, A is area of section, E is modulus of elasticity, L is length of 
member, I is moment of inertia of gross section of member.

The yield moment of a section (My
) cannot be found from basic mechanics of RC. 
It is obtained from bilinearization of moment–curvature diagram (see Section 1.7). 
SAP2000 software gives the yield moment in hinge results. The yield curvature for 
various sections are available in the literature and are summarized in Table 4.1 (see 
Priestley et al., 2007). The yield rotations of frame are also given in this table. It may 
be mentioned that for nonlinear analyses, one has to use the expected strength of 
materials.
The stiffness that can be taken in nonlinear analyses are one of the followings types:
1. Gross stiffness based on gross sectional property
2. Effective stiffness as given in FEMA-356 and in ASCE-SEI-41-17
3. Effective stiffness based on strength.
The effective stiffness values given by FEMA-356 and ASCE-SEI-41-17 are furnished 
in Table 4.2.
Das and Choudhury (2020) have highlighted the effect of using these three types 
of stiffnesses. It may be noted that the stiffness based on strength is the “exact” value 
of stiffness. So, in all nonlinear analyses, stiffness based on strength is to be used. 
In fact, one has to use the stiffness reduction factor in the computer model for each 
element.
4.3.1  Effective Stiffness for Columns
For columns, it is not possible to get any yield moment, as the failure is through 
an interaction between axial force and bending moment(s). It actually fails on a 
yield surface, which is constituted by P–M (axial force–moment) pair of values at 
each point. To overcome this problem for columns, Pettinga and Priestley (2005)
suggested to take the yield moment of column as moment corresponding to the axial 
load in column arising out of gravity load (dead and live load) in the interaction curve. 
We need to have the column interaction curves. Further, as the nonlinear analyses are 
done on expected strength level, the expected interaction diagram for column needs 
to be drawn. The process is explained in Figure 4.6.
With reference to Figure 4.6, let the axial force under dead load and live load 
for a column is P´, which is shown by ordinate OA. The corresponding moment as 
per failure surface is M´ given by abscissa OC. This may be considered as the yield 
moment for the column.

Since the interaction diagram at expected strength is involved, the computation of 
stiffness reduction factor for column is tedious. Das and Choudhury (2019) and Das 
et al. (2021) have developed artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regres￾sion (SVR) and genetic algorithm (GA) models for computation of stiffness reduction 
factor for columns, which eases out the process.
Example 4.3.1.1 The yield moment for a beam section of size 300 mm × 500 mm is 
210 kN-m. The yield strength of rebar is 415 MPa. Find the stiffness reduction factor 
for transverse bending about major axis. Concrete characteristic strength is 25 MPa.

4.4 PLASTIC HINGE CONCEPT
A physical hinge in a structure is characterized by zero bending moment. In contrast 
to this, the plastic hinge is a section where the materials are stressed to their max￾imum capacity and the moment of resistance offered by the section is maximum. 
This is called the plastic moment of resistance (Mp
). A section in an element remains 
under stress due to external loading. As the external load increases, the stress also 
increases and the stress may reach the yield stress at the extreme fibre. This condition 
is called as the yield level. If the external load is further increased, the inner fibres 
gradually reaches the yield stress. The steel section can thus attain a plastic condi￾tion where all the fibres are under yield stress. In concrete section, the nature of the 
stress block varies with codes. In Indian code (IS 456), the stress block is parabolic￾rectangular. In the American code, it is rectangular. Also, in steel, the yield stress is 
clearly defined (95% chance of exceedance) and is denoted by f
y
. But in concrete 
section, the corresponding stress in concrete is taken as 0.446 f
ck, embedding the par￾tial safety factor. When the parabolic-rectangular stress block formation is complete, 
the section is said to have reached the fully plastic condition (Figure 4.7).
As the plastic condition is reached, the section undergoes plastic deformation 
(non-regainable deformation). This will be visible as damage in the section. When 
the damage is more or less is confined in small length of the member, it is said to 
be lumped plasticity. In the computer model, lumped plasticity is a point plasticity. 
In contrast, when the damage is spread over a finite length of the member, it is said 
to be distributed plasticity. Modelling of distributed plasticity in computer is much 
more complicated than modelling of lumped plasticity. Localized or lumped plasti￾city and distributed plasticity are explained schematically in Figure 4.8. The length of 
distributed plasticity is denoted by l
p
.
Length of plasticity is available in literature in empirical forms (e.g., Priestley 
et al.,2007):

zone to be taken is at least equal to Ls .
The plastic hinge is further discussed below by taking a column as shown in 
Figure 4.9. The height of the column is H. Up to the yield condition, the treatment is 
linear. Beyond yielding, the system is nonlinear.

(φp

L L h p W inf = 0 2. + 0 0. 3 (4.4.5b)
In Eq. (4.4.5), hinf is height of inflection of shear wall. The lower value of Lp out of 
Eq. (4.4.5a) and (4.4.5b) is to be adopted.
4.5 MODELLING OF BEAM, COLUMN AND SHEAR WALL
4.5.1  Modelling Beams and Columns
RC beams are generally modelled as rectangular sections. This is valid for end section 
of the beam. At the mid-section, the RC beam is a T-beam. It is possible to model 
T-beam using section designer of SAP2000 software. A steel beam has a uniform 
cross-section all through its length. An RC column section may be square or rect￾angular. When it is rectangular, its orientation is to be decided. A column section 
can have longitudinal steel at opposite two faces, or equally spread over all faces. 
For steel column section also, the orientation is important. It is possible to model the 
stirrups in beams and ties in columns with appropriate software.
4.5.2  Modelling of Shear Wall
Shear wall is a thin (thickness 100 mm to about 350 mm) structural wall, which 
carries the lateral load in its own plane. It is weak in out-of-plane action. The 
shear wall can be modelled in computer software as: (i) planar shell element, 
(ii) wide column or (iii) layered shell element. Depending on the modelling, not 
all characteristics of shear wall can be captured. When it is modelled as a wide 
column, sectional dimension of the wide column is same as that of the shear wall 
(that is why the name wide column). The problem with this model is that the non￾linear behaviour of the column and shear wall are not the same. Even the range of 
plastic rotations for IO, LS and CP are also different for the two cases. One way to 
partly tackle this problem is to edit the hinge result of the wide column and match 
it manually with the data of shear wall. Such a nonlinear hinge is called “user￾defined hinge”. However, the behaviours of shear wall and column are different. 
Layered shell element consists of layers of concrete and reinforcing steel. It is 
said that this model is better than other models and is applicable to large shear 
wall too. But the problem with this model in SAP2000 is this that it does not show 
lumped plasticity hinge. Instead, it gives a distributed plastic state. In software 
like Perform-3D, shear wall can be modelled as a planar element.
Shear walls are to be provided symmetrically in opposite faces of the plan of 
any building. Also, there should be shear wall(s) in both the mutually perpendicular 
directions of the plan. Shear walls put at the periphery are able to resist more torsion. 
Shear walls are also provided centrally as lift case. Steel in shear wall runs horizon￾tally to take shear and, vertically to take the cantilever moment. Shear wall is actually 
a cantilever deep beam. Figure 4.10 gives details for a shear wall.Modelling Aspects 69
4.5.2.1 Computation of Plastic Rotation in Layered Shell Element Model
As mentioned already, layered shell element model does not give plastic rotation in 
the lumped plasticity form. Here, we tackle this in a different way. From section cut of 
wall at base, the moment–rotation diagram can be obtained, as shown in Figure 4.11. 
From moment–rotation diagram, maximum rotation angle can be read out. From 
maximum rotation angle, the yield rotation is subtracted to get the plastic rotation 
(Eq. (4.5.2.1)).

4.5.3 Bridge Pier
Figure 4.12 shows a bridge pier, which has undergone plastic hinge formation at the 
bottom. A part of plasticity enters the base and its length is called plastic strain pene￾tration length ( Ls ).

4.6 MODELLING INFILL WALL
Infill walls are generally made up of brick masonry. These are non-load-bearing 
and nonstructural members. Infills serves functions like protection from sun, 
wind, theft and sound. These also provide privacy to occupants. Infill being made 
of bricks and mortar joints, it cannot take tension, and develops cracks under the 
tensile load. But infill is good in compression and takes a large force in com￾pression. It is difficult to incorporate the infill as an area element, requiring finite 
element meshing. So, infill is replaced by equivalent compression strut. The 
thickness of the equivalent diagonal strut is equal to the thickness of the infill 
and the effective width of the strut is available in literature. During the to-and-fro 
shaking in earthquakes, the diagonal in the infill panel alternatively undergoes 
tension and compression as shown in Figure 4.13.
Now we shall discuss the computation of width of equivalent diagonal strut from 
literature.
4.6.1  FEMA-356 Provisions for Infill Strut

In a computer model, for nonlinear analyses, the infill strut is to be provided along 
both the diagonals; the compression diagonal will be active at any particular instant. 
Very often, we provide weight in beams manually to avoid meshing in the slab. Now, 
over and above, infill strut is provided. This may increase the weight over what is 
actual. To avoid this, the infill material may be defined with zero density and modulus 
of elasticity same as that of infill material.
4.6.3 Strength of Infill
FEMA-356 has given the compressive strength of masonry as 900 psi (good condi￾tion), 600 psi (fair condition) and 300 psi (poor condition) depending on the quality of 
masonry. The corresponding shear strength in psi are 27, 20 and 13 psi, respectively.
IS 1893 (Part 1) – 2016 has given the compressive strength of masonry by Eq. 
(4.6.3.1).
f f f m b mo = 0 433 0 64 0 36 . . . (4.6.3.1)
where, f
m is masonry compressive strength in MPa, f
b is compressive strength of 
brick in MPa, and f
mo is compressive strength of mortar in MPa.Modelling Aspects 73
The code also gives modulus of elasticity ( Em ) as Eq. (4.6.3.2).
E f m m = 550 (units in MPa) (4.6.3.2)
The expected strength of masonry is 1.3 times its designated strength. More 
discussions on infill is available in Chapter 12.
4.6.4  Axial Capacity of Infill Strut
In computer modelling of infill strut, it is necessary to provide its axial strength. In 
fact, the axial-carrying capacity of infill compression strut arises out the horizontal 
shear strength of the infill masonry. The horizontal shear failure occurs along the bed 
joint. Consider Figure 4.14.
With reference to Figure 4.14,
Q = horizontal shear capacity of bed joint
q = bed joint shear strength of masonry infill
θ = angle of inclination of diagonal with horizontal
A = net area of cross-section of infill

L = horizontal length of an infill panel

Or, cos
F qtL = θ (4.6.4)
FIGURE 4.14 Infill strength.74 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
The axial capacity of the equivalent infill strut is given by Eq. (4.6.4). Such axial 
force will be required in modelling of axial force–deformation behaviour of the 
infill strut.
4.7 P-DELTA EFFECT
P-delta ( P − ∆ ) effect is said to be a geometric nonlinearity. The column in normal 
state may be under some axial load and bending moment. When there is sway of the 
column, the axial load changes position by an amount ∆ with respect the lower end, 
as a result of which additional moment equal to P ∆ comes into play (Figure 4.15). 
The total moment now has more potential to cause damage in the column. The 
damage at the bottom of the column will increase its sway and hence, will create 
more P-delta effect.
P-delta effects are classified as: (i) static P-delta effect and (ii) dynamic P-delta 
effect.
4.7.1 Static P-​Delta Effect
This involves static procedure as per FEMA-356. It is to be included in both linear 
static and nonlinear static cases.
For linear procedure, the stability coefficient (θi
) as given by Eq. (4.7.1) is to be 
calculated:

where Pi = is portion of the total weight of the structure arising out of DL, per￾manent LL and 25% of transient LL acting on columns at floor level i.
Vi = the total calculated lateral shear force in the direction under consid￾eration at storey i due to earthquake response to the selected ground 
shaking level, as indicated by the selected linear analysis procedure
hi = height of storey i between centre line of slabs
δi = Lateral drift in story i, in the direction under consideration, at its centre 
of rigidity, using the same units as for measuring hi
The stability coefficient is to be calculated for all storeys. If θi is less than 0.1 in all 
storeys, the P-delta effect need not be considered. When θi is between 0.1 and 0.33, 
all seismic force in the storey concerned to be increased by the factor 1/(1 −θi ). If it 
is greater than 0.33, the structure is unstable and needs redesign/retrofit.
For nonlinear procedures, static P-delta effect shall be incorporated in the analysis 
by including within the mathematical model the nonlinear force–deformation rela￾tionship of all elements and components subjected to axial forces.
4.7.2  Dynamic P-​Delta Effect
This considers hysteresis and stiffness degradation during dynamic loading. This is 
partially accommodated by introducing pseudo lateral load. In nonlinear dynamic 
analysis, the P-delta effect is automatically considered.
P-delta effect can cause strength degradation and stiffness reduction of the system 
as shown in Figure 4.16. In fact, the stiffness may become negative (i.e. slope is 
negative). Strength degradation is synonymous with reduction in capacity. Stiffness 
degradation will lead to more displacement.
4.8 TOTAL DAMPING
Total damping in the system is also called as equivalent damping (ξeq ) and it arises 
out of material damping (ξ m ), hysteretic damping (ξ h ) and added damping (ξ a ). This 
FIGURE 4.16 P-delta effect: strength and stiffness degradation.76 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
is given in Eq. (4.8.1). Material damping is inherent property of the material. For con￾crete ξ m = 5%, for steel ξ m = 2%.
ξ ξ ξ ξ eq m h a = + + (4.8.1)
The hysteretic damping (also see sec. 2.13) arises out of damage and hysteresis 
loop arising out of to-and-fro or cyclic motion. Hysteretic damping is given by 
Eq. (4.8.2).

4.9 DUCTILITY CONSIDERATIONS
4.9.1 Basic Concepts of Ductility
Ductility is the ability of a structure or structural element to undergo large deform￾ation without significantly losing its strength. Ductility helps the structure survive 
from a collapse under strong ground motions. Ductility also enables us to apply 
response reduction factor in base shear formula, thereby reducing the design force 
and leading to economy. Ductility arises out of proper detailing in RC structures and 
from appropriate connection details in steel structures. As a mathematical expression, 
ductility (µ) is the ratio of ultimate deformation (δ u ) to the yield deformation (δ y ), 
given by Eq. (4.9.1.1) and explained in Figure 4.17.
µ
δ
δ = u
y
(4.9.1.1)
Here the deformation means a generalized deformation involving linear displace￾ment (∆), rotation (θ), shearing (γ ), twisting (φ), strain (ε ), curvature (φ) etc. Based Modelling Aspects 77
on these deformation parameters, the ductility also can be described differently. 
Corresponding to the yield point we have yield deformation. Beyond yield deform￾ation is the plastic deformation zone (δ p). It is evident that the ductility will be more 
when plastic deformation is more. This is also evident from Eq. (4.9.2).

1 (4.9.1.2)
Eq. (4.9.1.2) also suggests that ductility is more than unity. A ductility value of unity 
implies an elastic system (as is δ p zero). Eq. (4.9.1.2) also shows that ductility can 
be increased by enhancing the plastic deformation zone length. This is achievable

they represent the same ductility of a structure or element. Magnitude wise we can

4.10 BASE OF THE BUILDING
In modelling, confusion often arises as to where the base of the building to be 
considered. This is clarified by Figure 4.20. The base of a building is the junction of 
the column and the footing.
The physical base of a building is bottom of the foundation. But as the foundation 
is infinitely rigid, so the base is considered at the bottom of the column for computer 
model of building.
4.11 A NOTE ON PLASTIC ROTATIONS AS PER ASCE-SEI-17
The FEMA-356 gives plastic rotation limit states for structural and nonstructural 
components separately. But in the ASCE-SEI-41-17 document, the plastic rotation 
limit states are given for nonstructural components only. It is found that SAP2000 
software implemented rotation limits as per first row of table (instead of average 
value of compliant buildings). The provisions of ASCE-SEI-17 are LS is 0.75 times of 
deformation at CP; IO is not greater than 0.67 times deformation at LS. Considering 
plastic deformation at first row of table in ASCE-41-17 (as is also taken in SAP2000 
software), for primary members: a = 0.025 radian. So, for CP the plastic rotation 
for primary members is 0.025 radian. For LS it is 0.75 × 0.025 = 0.01875 radian. 
IO = 0.67 × 0.01875 = 0.0125 radian. These are explained in Figure 4.21. Thus, while 80 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
using new versions of SAP2000, one has to supply user-defined hinge for structural 
members.
4.12 TORSIONAL EFFECT IN STRUCTURES
The eccentricity of centre mass and centre of rigidity cause torsion in the structure. 
Similarly, the eccentricity of centre of shear strength and centre of mass also leads to 
torsion. The eccentricity may be along both the major directions of plan of structures. 
Consider Figure 4.22.
Let, CM sand for centre of mass, CR stand for centre of rigidity and CV denote 
centre of shear resistance.
FIGURE 4.21 IO, LS, CP locations are per ASCE-SEI-41-17 (schematic).

Once the locations of CM, CR and CV are determined, the eccentricities with respect 
to CM can be calculated. These eccentricities matter in computing torsional effects.
The best solution for avoiding torsion in structure is to pan and design members so 
that torsional effect is avoided or put to a minimum. However, a change in displace￾ment may be applied for mitigating torsional effects (Priestley et al., 2007) as shown 
in Eq. (4.12.4).
∆ ∆ corrected c c = − θ( x e − ) (4.12.4)
where
∆corrected = corrected design displacement
∆c = drift-controlled displacement at critical element
xc = distance of critical element from CM
θ = design drift
e = eccentricity between CM and CV in the direction concerned.
4.13 CONFINED VERSUS UNCONFINED CONCRETE
In all practical situations, the concrete in beams or columns is confined by the 
stirrups and ties. This confinement increases the compressive strength and duc￾tility to a large extent. Normal design ignores this effect, leading to conserva￾tive design. It is possible to model the confined concrete in Section Designer 
of SAP2000 software. The behaviour of unconfined and confined concrete is 
demonstrated in Figure 4.23.
Unconfined concrete is not confined by any reinforcement. This is just like 
plain concrete. So far as structural use is concerned, unconfined concrete is a 
hypothetical case. Unconfined concrete exhibits the bare compressive strength of 
concrete.
FIGURE 4.23 Stress–strain curve of confined and unconfined concrete.Modelling Aspects 83

ε un = compressive strain in unconfined concrete corresponding to the maximum 
unconfined compressive stress, σun .
As seen from Figure 4.23, the confined concrete exhibits much higher strength and 
ductility (as ultimate strain is much higher). A confined concrete section has the 
inner core confined by steel and outside the confining steel remains the unconfined 
concrete. With Section Designer of SAP2000 software, it is possible to model such 
section.84 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
Figure 4.24 shows the confinement effect in column. Due to the confining effect of 
tie, three types of concrete are developed, namely, confined core concrete, unconfined 
outer cover concrete and partially confined concrete. The unconfined concrete spall 
easily during earthquake shaking.

4.14.2  Examples Related to Section 4.5
Example 4.14.2 A shear wall of horizontal length 5 m has inflection height as 
20 m. In a section cut result at the base of the wall, maximum rotation was found 
as 0.004 radian. If IO, LS and CP for shear wall correspond to 0.005, 0.01 and 
0.02 radian respectively, determine the plastic state of the wall. The rebar is of 
grade Fe415.
Solution: Here, Lw = 5 m, hinf = 20 m, θ max = 0.004 radian, f

So, the plastic rotation being less than 0.005, it is in IO range.

Example 4.14.5: An infill panel is shown in Figure 4.26. The centre-to-centre 
of floor slabs is 3.2 m. The horizontal distance between columns is 4 m. The 
thickness of infill is 200 mm. Beam size is 350 mm × 450 mm and column size 
is 400 mm × 400 mm. Modulus of elasticity of concrete is 362,000 psi. Shear 
strength of masonry is 20 psi. Find (i) the width of equivalent infill strut (ii) axial

4.15 CLOSURE
General modelling issues for civil engineering structures have been discussed in this 
chapter. Accuracy in getting true structural behaviour depends vastly on correct mod￾elling. It may be noted that the modelling takes more time than analysis and design 
do. Various strength levels have been discussed on statistical terms. In nonlinear ana￾lyses and damage-based design, expected strength is to be used.

5 Performance Criteria and 
Performance Levels
5.1 INTRODUCTION
The aim of PBD is to design structures with some intended design objectives to be 
achieved under some specified hazard level. Performance criteria are quantifiable 
structural responses, which lead to performance objectives. Performance criteria look 
like serviceability criteria in some cases, but they are mostly nonlinear in character. 
The design and acceptance criteria are mainly obtained from experimental results. 
Most of the existing design philosophies focus on drift as the design target objective. 
The UPBD method accommodates both drift and performance level in the design 
methodology. In future, more target objectives may be incorporated.
5.2 PERFORMANCE LEVELS
Performance level (PL) indicates a damage state of an element or whole structure. 
The PL can be quantified in terms of plastic deformation of the elements of the struc￾ture. PLs can be designated in terms of plastic rotations in beams, walls and columns, 
cracks in members and drift of members. More damage implies lower PL and vice 
versa. The PLs can be discrete points or a range on a damage scenario. A simple 
explanation of PL is given in Figure 5.1, where the force–deformation behaviour of 
an element is demonstrated. The amount of plastic deformation will determine the PL 
of the element.
PLs have been given some nomenclature along with quantification in FEMA￾273 and FEMA-356 documents. The PLs are designated for structural components 
and non-structural components separately. Finally, the damage state designation of 
a building is given as a combination of the structural PLs and non-structural PLs. 
Qualitatively, the PLs are designated in terms of consequence of strong earthquakes 
on the structural and non-structural components.
The general descriptors of PLs are: (i) immediate occupancy (IO), where the 
damage in the structural components and non-structural components is so small that 
the building can be occupied immediately after the earthquake without major repair or 
retrofitting; (ii) life safety (LS), where the damage in the structural and non-structural 
components is large but it does not threaten the life of the occupants and (iii) collapse 
prevention (CP), where the damage in the structural and non-structural components 
are very high, but the structure does not collapse. There are ranges of performance 
other than the said discrete point designators (see Figure 5.2).Performance Criteria and Performance Levels 95
5.2.1 Structural Performance Levels
The structural PLs are expressed as a combination of a letter ‘S’ and a number. The 
list of structural PLs is tabulated in Table 5.1 and are illustrated in Figure 5.2.
Figure 5.2 is a plot between base shear and roof displacement of a building. 
This is called a pushover curve or capacity curve (see details in Chapter 6). A little 
away from the elastic range (yield point) is the Immediate Occupancy (IO) PL; here 
damage is limited. Further forward, the damage state is the life safety (LS) PL, where 
the damage is substantial, but it does not cause a threat to life. At still higher damage, 
the damage state is called collapse prevention (CP), at which damage is almost com￾plete but the structure has not collapsed. In between IO and LS is the damage control 
range. In between LS and CP lies the limited safety range. One can opt for building 
corresponding to the standard discrete PLs such as IO, LS or CP, or one can also have 
a building on the damage control range or limited safety range. The structural per￾formance levels are tabulated in Table 5.1.
More detailed description of the PLs and acceptance criteria are furnished in 
Table 5.2.
FIGURE 5.2 Performance Levels shown on a pushover curve.
FIGURE 5.1 Illustration of plastic deformation for a PL.96 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
5.2.2  Non-structural Performance Levels
Non-structural members in a building include doors, windows, lift, elevator, stair￾case, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, oxygen supply pipes, 
chemical gas supply pipe, infill, building joint, equipment, furniture and contents. 
The safety of the non-structural items are important for serviceability of the building. 
TABLE 5.1
Structural performance level designators
PL designator PL name Description
S1 Immediate 
Occupancy (IO)
It is defined as the post-earthquake damage state that 
remains safe to occupy, essentially retaining the 
pre-earthquake design strength and stiffness of the 
structure. Here only very limited structural damage 
occurs. The basic vertical- and lateral-force-resisting 
systems of the building retain nearly all of their pre￾earthquake strength and stiffness.
S2 Damage control 
range
This is defined as the continuous range of damage 
states between the IO PL and LS PL.
S3 Life Safety (LS) Structural Performance is defined as the post￾earthquake damage state that includes damage to 
structural components but retains a margin against 
onset of partial or total collapse. Some structural 
elements and components are severely damaged, 
but this does not lead to large falling debris hazards, 
either within or outside the building. Injuries may 
occur during the earthquake; however, the overall 
risk of life-threatening injury as a result of structural 
damage is expected to be low.
S4 Limited safety 
range
It is a range of damage state lying between LS and CP 
PLs.
S5 Collapse 
Prevention (CP)
This is defined as the post-earthquake damage state 
that includes damage to structural components 
such that the structure continues to support gravity 
loads but retains no margin against collapse. 
Substantial damage to the structure has occurred, 
potentially including significant degradation in the 
stiffness and strength of the lateral-force resisting 
system, large permanent lateral deformation of the 
structure. However, all significant components of 
the gravity load resisting system must continue to 
carry their gravity load demands. Significant risk of 
injury due to falling hazards from structural debris 
may exist.

In some cases, like hospital buildings, the cost of the non-structural items may be 
up to 85% of the cost of the total cost of the structure. The non-structural PLs are 
designated as NA, NB etc. as detailed in Table 5.3.
More details of non-structural PLs are given in Table 5.4 and Table 5.5.
TABLE 5.3
Non-structural performance level designators (after FEMA-356)
PL 
designator PL name Description
NA Operational 
(N-A)
Non-structural Performance Level N-A, is defined as the 
post-earthquake damage state in which the non-structural 
components are able to support the pre-earthquake 
functions present in the building.
most non-structural systems required for normal use of the 
building are functional, although minor clean-up and repair 
of some items may be required. In addition to assuring 
that non-structural components are properly mounted and 
braced within the structure, it is often necessary to provide 
emergency standby utilities.
NB Immediate 
Occupancy 
(N-B)
Non-structural Performance Level N-B is defined as the 
post-earthquake damage state that includes damage to non￾structural components, but building access and life safety 
systems including doors, stairways, elevators, emergency 
lighting, fire alarms, and suppression systems generally 
remain available and operable, provided that power is 
available.
Minor window breakage and slight damage could occur 
to some components. Presuming that the building is 
structurally safe, occupants could safely remain in the 
building, although normal use may be impaired and some 
clean-up and inspection may be required. In general, 
components of mechanical and electrical systems in the 
building are structurally secured and should be able to 
function if necessary utility service is available. However, 
some components may experience misalignments or 
internal damage and be non-operable. Power, water, 
natural gas, communications lines, and other utilities 
required for normal building use may not be available. The 
risk of life-threatening injury due to non-structural damage 
is very low.
NC Life Safety 
(N-C)
Non-structural Performance Level N-C is defined as the 
post-earthquake damage state that includes damage to 
non-structural components but the damage is non-life￾threatening. Here potentially significant and costly damage 
has occurred to non-structural components but they have 
not become dislodged and fallen, threatening life safetyPerformance Criteria and Performance Levels 101
5.2.3 Building Performance Levels
Building performance levels are expressed in terms of combination of structural PL 
and non-structural PL. However, a judicious combination is desirable. The building 
PLs are described in Table 5.6.
Building PL = Structural PL + Non-structural PL
Any arbitrary combination is not allowed. A high structural PL should not be 
combined with a low non-structural PL, and vice versa. Because this will lead to 
damage of the one type before the other. The ideal condition is when both structural 
and non-structural components get damaged by the amount degree.
PL 
designator PL name Description
either inside or outside the building. Egress routes within 
the building are not extensively blocked, but may be 
impaired by lightweight debris. HVAC, plumbing, and fire 
suppression systems may have been damaged, resulting in 
local flooding as well as loss of function. Restoration of 
the non-structural components may take extensive effort.
ND Hazard 
Reduced 
(N-D)
Non-structural Performance Level N-D is defined as the 
post-earthquake damage state that includes damage to non￾structural components that could potentially create falling 
hazards. Preservation of egress, protection of fire suppression 
systems, and similar life safety issues are not addressed in 
this Non-structural Performance Level. ND represents a 
post-earthquake damage state in which extensive damage 
has occurred to non-structural components, but large or 
heavy items that pose a high risk of falling hazard to a large 
number of people such as parapets, cladding panels, heavy 
plaster ceilings, or storage racks are prevented from falling. 
While isolated serious injury could occur from falling debris, 
failures that could injure large numbers of persons - either 
inside or outside the structure, should be avoided.
NE Non-structural 
PL not 
considered
A building design/rehabilitation that does not address non￾structural components shall be classified as under this 
definition. In some cases, the decision to rehabilitate 
the structure may be made without addressing the 
vulnerabilities of non-structural components. Also, since 
many of the most severe hazards to life safety occur as a 
result of structural vulnerabilities, some municipalities 
may wish to adopt rehabilitation ordinances that require 
structural rehabilitation only.

The allowable combinations of structural PL and non-structural PL are shown in 
Table 5.6. The standard building nomenclature out of this (see Table 5.7) are as 
follows:
Operational level building: (OL) 1-A: Applicable for Hospital buildings,
other such important buildings.
Immediate occupancy level building: (IO) 1-B: Applicable for important buildings.
Life safety level building: (LS) 3-C: Normal standard buildings, assembly hall
other such important buildings.
Collapse prevention level building: (CP) 5-E: Normal buildings.
In a post-earthquake scenario, hospital buildings assume the highest import￾ance. Injured people (likely to be large in number in a major earthquake) need 
to be hospitalized. The need for a hospital in such a condition is more important 
than relief and rehabilitation. If a hospital building collapses, it leads to (i) death 
of indoor patients, (ii) death of doctors, (iii) death of medical staff, (iv) damage of 
costly equipment and services, (v) disruption of normal services and (vi) decline of 
admission of injured patients. So, the hospital buildings are to be designed with most 
stringent requirements and at high seismicity level, may be at MCE level, instead of 
DBE level.
The relative damage states of buildings are depicted in Figure 5.3. Higher PL cor￾responds to less damage and lower PL corresponds to high damage. Other combin￾ations of structural PLs and non-structural PLs are shown in Table 5.7. In this table, it 
is clear that all arbitrary combinations of PLs are not viable. Some combinations are 
also not economical.
5.3 MEMBER PERFORMANCE LEVELS
The designators of PLs so far discussed depend on the plastic rotations that the 
members undergo in strong ground motions. The plastic rotations obtained through 
experiments and refined through consensus are available in FEMA documents sand 
ASCE-41 series. The plastic rotations for beams, columns and shear walls etc. vary and 
are given in Tables 5.8 to 5.10. The member PLs in terms of plastic rotations depends 
on various parameters like reinforcement ratio, shear force etc. It may be noted that 
there are some differences between FEMA-356 and ASCE-SEI-41-17 values. The 
later has not differentiated the primary and secondary divisions of members.
In Tables 5.8 to 5.10 the values of force–deformation response parameters (a, b, d, 
d, e) are not shown. These have been discussed in Chapter 4.
N.B. In Table 5.8, (i) ρt is percentage tension steel, ρc is percentage compression 
steel, ρbal is percentage balanced steel. (ii) ‘Avg’ means average. (iii) ‘C’ and ‘NC’ are 
abbreviations for conforming and nonconforming transverse reinforcement. A com￾ponent is conforming if, within the flexural plastic hinge region, hoops are spaced 
at ≤ d/3, and if, for components of moderate and high ductility demand, the strength 
provided by the hoops (Vs) is at least three-fourths of the design shear. Otherwise, the 
component is considered nonconforming. For India condition, ‘C’ may be interpreted 105 Performance Criteria and Performance Levels (continued) TABLE 5.6 Building performance level designators PL designator PL name Structural PL in the combination Non-structural PL in the combination Description OL S1-NA Or 1A Operational level S1 NA In this PL, the structural components of the building shall meet the requirements of Immediate Occupancy Structural Performance Level (S-1) and the non-structural components shall meet the requirements of Operational Non-structural Performance Level (N-A). Buildings meeting this Building PL are expected to sustain minimal or no damage to their structural and non-structural components. The building is suitable for its normal occupancy and use, although possibly in a slightly impaired mode, with power, water, and other required utilities provided from emergency sources, and possibly with some nonessential systems not functioning. Buildings meeting this target Building Performance Level pose an extremely low risk to life safety. IO S1-NB or 1B Immediate Occupancy level S1 NB It is the combination of IO PL (S-1) for structural N-B PL for non-structural components. Such buildings are expected to sustain minimal or no damage to their structural elements and only minor damage to their non-structural components. While it would be safe to re-occupy a building meeting this target PL immediately following a major earthquake, non-structural systems may not function, either because of the lack of electrical power or internal damage to equipment. Some clean-up and repair may be necessary before the building can function in a normal mode. The risk to life safety at this target Building Performance Level is very low. This level provides most of the protection obtained under the OL Buildings without the cost of providing standby utilities.

Such buildings may experience extensive damage to structural and non-structural components. Repairs may be required before re-occupancy of the building occurs, and repair may be deemed economically impractical I some cases. The risk to life safety in buildings meeting this target Building PL is low. CP S5- NE or 5E Collapse Prevention level S5 NE This Building PL is a combination of S5 structural PL and NE non-structural PL. Non- structural components are not considered. Buildings meeting this target Building Performance Level may pose a significant hazard to life safety resulting from failure of non-structural components. However, because the building itself does not collapse, gross loss of life may well be avoided. Many buildings meeting this level will be complete economic losses. This level has been sometimes selected as the basis for mandatory seismic rehabilitation ordinances enacted by municipalities, as it results in mitigation of the most severe life-safety hazards at relatively low cost.

In ASCE-SEI-41-17 similar tables are provided. For IO level, the acceptance cri￾teria are same for primary and secondary members. But for LS and CP, the tables

are to be computed by the user. This has led to lot of confusions for the users. For 
example, SAP2000 software has implemented the table values of this document dir￾ectly. Thus, the default hinges give properties of secondary members and not primary 
members. The user has to generate user-defined hinges for the primary members.

This gives troubles to the user. ASCE-SEI-17 could easily add columns for primary 
members in the tables, thus avoiding inconvenience to the users.
5.4 MULTI-OBJECTIVE DESIGN
In Chapter 3, various safety objectives and hazard levels have been described. Designing 
building for only one objective may not be judicial and economical. A building should 
satisfy very the condition of less damage at very les seismicity level and moderate 
damage at moderate hazard level. It may suffer high damage at high hazard level. 
Combining these concepts, design safety objectives are shown in Table 5.11.
5.4.1 Basic Safety Objective (BSO)
The Basic Safety Objective (BSO) is a design/rehabilitation objective that achieves 
the dual rehabilitation goals of (i) life safety building performance level (3-C) for 
the BSE-1 earthquake hazard level and (ii) collapse prevention building performance 
level (5-E) for the BSE-2 earthquake hazard level.
The basic safety objective (BSO) refers to the earthquake risk of life safety cat￾egory, generally intended by design codes. Buildings meeting the BSO are expected 
to experience little damage from relatively frequent, moderate earthquakes, but sig￾nificantly more damage and potential economic loss from the most severe and infre￾quent earthquakes that could affect them.
5.4.2  Enhanced Design/​Rehabilitation Objectives
Design/rehabilitation that provides building performance exceeding that of the BSO 
is termed an enhanced objective (EO). Enhanced objectives shall be achieved using 
one or a combination of the following two methods:
TABLE 5.11
Building design/Rehabilitation objectives

Levels
50%/50 year a b c d
20%/50 year e f g h
BSE-1 (~10%/50year) i j k l
BSE-2 (~2%/50 year) m n o p
Notes: Each cell represents a discrete design/rehabilitation objective.
k + p = Basic Safety Objective (BSO)
k + p + (any of a, e, i, h, f, j or n) = Enhanced objective
o, n, m alone = Enhanced objective
k alone or p alone = Limited objectives
c, g, d, h, l = Limited objectivesPerformance Criteria and Performance Levels 111
(i) By designing for target building performance levels that exceed those of the 
BSO at either the BSE-1 or BSE-2 hazard levels, or both.
(ii) By designing for the target building performance levels of the BSO using an 
earthquake hazard level that exceeds either the BSE-1 or BSE-2 hazard levels, 
or both.
So, in a nutshell, enhanced objectives can be obtained by designing for higher 
target building performance levels (method i) or by designing using higher earth￾quake hazard levels (method ii) or any combination of these two methods.
5.4.3  Limited Design/​Rehabilitation Objectives
Design/rehabilitation that provides building performance less than that of the BSO is 
termed a limited objective. Limited objectives shall be achieved using the following 
conditions:
(a) The measures shall not result in a reduction in the performance level of the 
existing building.
(b) The measures shall not create a new structural irregularity or make an existing 
structural irregularity more severe.
(c) The measures shall not result in an increase in the seismic forces to any com￾ponent that is deficient in capacity to resist these forces.
(d) All new or rehabilitated structural components and elements shall be detailed 
and connected to the existing structure suitably.
5.4.4  Reduced Design/​Rehabilitation Objective
Design/rehabilitation that addresses the entire building structural and non-structural 
systems, but uses a lower seismic hazard or lower target building performance level 
than the BSO, is termed as reduced rehabilitation objective. Reduced rehabilitation 
shall be designed for one or more of the following objectives:
(i) Life safety building performance level (3-C) for earthquake demands that are 
less severe (more probable) than the BSE-1;
(ii) Collapse Prevention building performance level (5-E) for earthquake demands 
that are less severe (more probable) than the BSE-2;
(iii) Building performance levels 4-C, 4-D, 4-E, 5-C, 5-D, 5-E, 6-D, or 6-E for 
BSE-1 or less severe (more probable) earthquake demands.
Table 5.11 is to be understood this way – BSO indicates the structure has to satisfy LS 
criterion under earthquake level BSE-1, and it also has to satisfy CP level at BSE-2. 
Similarly with other cells. In this table, ‘m’ is the highest building PL under highest 
earthquake.

Analysis for the 
Evaluation of Structures
6.1 INTRODUCTION
In performance-based design, a structure is designed for a set of pre-defined target 
performance objectives under a specified hazard level. There are engineering 
techniques to carry out these designs. But the designed structure needs to be checked 
if it really satisfies the set targets under the pre-set hazard level. This is done through 
nonlinear analyses of the designed structure. However, linear analysis also may throw 
some light on the structural behaviours. A classification of analysis types is shown in 
Figure 6.1.
6.2 LINEAR ANALYSIS
Linear analysis, also known as elastic analysis, is carried out considering the struc￾ture to be behaving linearly. This happens when the applied actions are within the 
corresponding yield strengths of the elements. The analyses that are covered in 
undergraduate courses like slope deflection method of analysis and matrix method of 
analysis come under linear analysis. In the realm of dynamics or earthquake engin￾eering, modal analysis and codal response spectrum method of analysis are linear 
analyses. Linear time history analysis (LTHA) also can be carried out when ground 
motions are applied on the structure and its response histories are captured without 
considering nonlinearity in the system. Some insight, like floor spectra of buildings, 
are obtained through linear dynamic analysis (LDA). Various methods of time his￾tory analysis (both linear and nonlinear) are available such as Newmark’s method, 
Wilsons’s method, collocation method and Hilber–Hughes–Taylor method. Linear 
analysis may be applied when higher mode effect is negligible. Linear analyses are 
applicable when the degree of nonlinearity in the structure is low. Quantitatively, 
linear procedure is applicable when demand capacity ratio (DCR) is less than 2.0.
6.3 NONLINEAR ANALYSIS
Nonlinearity arises out of (i) material nonlinearity and (ii) P-delta effect and large 
deflection. Here the elements yield and undergo further plastic deformation. In the 
computer model, nonlinear hinges are to be assigned to appropriate locations of the 
6114 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
members. Members will show nonlinear force–deformation response (Figure 6.2). 
The nonlinear actions may be in flexure, shear, torsion or axial force. Accordingly, we 
can have flexural hinge, shear hinge and axial hinge in the element.
Nonlinear analyses may be (i) nonlinear static analysis (NSA) or (ii) nonlinear 
dynamic analysis (NDA). Nonlinear static analysis is called also pushover ana￾lysis (POA). Nonlinear dynamic analysis is also called nonlinear time history ana￾lysis (NLTHA). POA uses monotonically increasing static load of some specified 
pattern. POA results approximately simulates the dynamic conditions. The NLTHA is 
supposed to give most accurate results as the response. From NLTHA, the performance 
FIGURE 6.2 (a) Nonlinear response of structure/element and (b) P- ∆ effect.
FIGURE 6.1 Analysis types.Analysis for the Evaluation of Structures 115
level of the structure can be judged, the drift can be computed and variation of any 
response parameter over the tie duration of applied ground motion can be obtained.
6.3.1 P-​Delta Effect and its Consideration
P-delta effect (or P- ∆ effect) has been partly described in Section 4.7. It arises due 
to sway of columns (Figure 6.2b). There is initial bending moment at the base of the 
column equal to H × h. Now as the column sways laterally, new moment arises whose 
magnitude is P×∆ . As the deflection increases, the new component of the moment 
also increases. This may eventually lead to failure of the column.
P-delta effect can be of two types: (i) P-delta effect for linear analysis and 
(ii) dynamic P-delta effect.
6.3.1.1 P-Delta Effect for Static Linear Procedure (FEMA-356)
For determining the P-delta effect in linear procedure (linear analysis), Eq. (6.3.1.1) 
is used to evaluate the stability coefficient θi .

rigidity, using the same units as for measuring hi
Vi = the total calculated lateral shear force in the direction under consideration 
at storey i due to earthquake response to the selected ground shaking level, 
as indicated by the selected linear analysis procedure
hi = height of story i
Action to be taken is as follows:
If θi < 0.1 in all stories: P-delta effect need not be taken.
If 0.1 < θi < 0.33: seismic forces and deformations in storey i is to be increased by 
the factor 1
1− θi
 for the purpose of rehabilitation/redesign
If θi > 0.33, the building is not safe. Re-design/rehabilitation to the full extent is 
needed till θi becomes less than 0.33.
6.3.1.2 P-Delta Effect for Static Nonlinear Procedure
For nonlinear procedures, static P-delta effects shall be incorporated in the analysis 
by including in the mathematical model the nonlinear force–deformation relationship 
of all elements and components subjected to axial forces.116 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures

6.4 PUSHOVER ANALYSIS
6.4.1  General
Pushover analysis (POA) is a nonlinear static analysis. The structure is at first loaded 
with a gravity load. Now, some pattern of lateral loads of small magnitude is applied. 
This pushes the structure in the direction of the applied loads. The base shear and 
displacement at the top of the structure is noted. The lateral loads are increased by 
some percentage. The new displacement is noted. This process is continued till some 
desired displacement level is attained or till the structure becomes unstable. The lat￾eral load applied is called the monotonically increasing load. The curve that we get 
by joining the response points (base shear vs. roof displacement) is called pushover 
curve (POC) or capacity curve. The curve is supposed to simulate the backbone curve 
of hysteresis. That is why the static procedure simulates the dynamic earthquake 
effects partially.
To understand the process, let us consider a portal frame as in Figure 6.3. Suppose 
the flexural strengths of members 1, 2, and 3 are S1
, S2
 and S3
, respectively, such that 
S1
 < S2
 < S3
. The frame is loaded with a gravity load. Now a small lateral load H is 
applied at top. The generated base shear is Vb1 = H. This produces displacement at 
top by amount ∆1 . We note down the point (Vb1, ∆1
). Now, let us increase the lateral 
load by 2% (i.e. new lateral load is 1.02H). Let the top displacement be ∆2
. Note the 
point (Vb2, ∆2 ). These steps will be repeated and a series of points (Vbi
, ∆i
). will be 
obtained for increasing values of i. Joining these points, we get the POC. Note that 
FIGURE 6.3 (a) A portal frame and (b) pushover curve.Analysis for the Evaluation of Structures 117
during the process the member with the least strength yields first. Gradually, other 
members also yield.
For multilevel structures like buildings, the lateral load of the chosen pattern is 
placed at each floor level. Then the question arises – what lateral load is to be taken 
for a structure? The lateral load can be constant over the height and may vary in a 
triangular fashion or parabolic fashion. FEMA-356 has given the flowing two series 
of lateral load patterns: pattern A and pattern B. At least, one pattern from A and one 
pattern from B is to be taken for POA.
6.4.2  Lateral Load Patterns
Pushover analysis (POA) is carried out on a structure already subjected to gravity 
load; a step-by-step lateral load is applied to push the system in one side. As the lat￾eral load is applied, the opposite base shear equal in magnitude with the total lateral 
load comes into play. Initially, some steps will undergo the process in the elastic 
condition. After some pushing steps, members will start forming plasticity, partially 
or fully. Gradually, more members will fail. At each step of lateral load increment, 
the base shear (Vi
) and the roof displacement (Droof i) are noted. Pushover curve (also 
called capacity curve) is the line joining all such points (Droof i,Vi
).
The question arises – what type of lateral load is to be applied? Some simplified lat￾eral loads are: (i) triangular distribution, (ii) rectangular distribution and (iii) inverted 
triangular distribution. Some arbitrary lateral load patterns are shown in Figure 6.4.
Such lateral loadings may be called as arbitrary. Our aim is to get a simulation of 
backbone curve through a simplified analysis (backbone curve is the average path 
line of hysteretic damage cycles). So, a judicious choice of lateral load is necessary. 
A first-mode proportional lateral load pattern seems to be rational, as the structure 
will bend in the first mode shape. But the first mode use will exclude the higher 
mode effect. Also, the masses in the system play an important role in the nonlinear 
behaviour. So, a mass-proportional lateral load distribution is also a rational one. 
Considering all these, FEMA has given some specified lateral load pattern, which is 
highlighted below.
The lateral loads are given in two parts, which are shown here (Section 6.4.2.1 
and Section 6.4.2.2) as part A and part B. At least one loading from each part is to 
be taken in POA.

(d) mass proportional.118 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures

only when more than 75% of the total mass participates in this mode.

by combining modal responses from a response spectrum analysis of the 
building, including sufficient modes to capture at least 90% of the total building 
mass and using the appropriate ground motion spectrum. This distribution shall 
be used when the period of the fundamental mode exceeds 1.0 sec.

The uniform load distribution (B.1) means the lateral load at any floor is applied in 
proportion to the mass of that floor.
The adaptive load distribution (B.2) has to change as per the current displacement 
of the structure. This is more accurate but much more difficult to implement.
Out of the necessary two to be taken from two groups, A.2 (mode proportional) 
and B.1 (mass proportional) are easy to apply. It may be noted that mode proportional 
loading can be applied if the mode under consideration (first mode in the direction 
concerned) has at least 75% mass participation. It is obvious that higher mode effects 
are left out. This has been taken care of in multimodal POA (MPOA), discussed in 
Section 6.4.3. As such, mode-proportional (A.2) loading represents a lower bound Analysis for the Evaluation of Structures 119
of capacity of the structure. Since all masses are involved, uniform loading (B.1) 
represents the upper bound of the capacity.
6.4.2.3 How Many Pushover Curves?
Pushover analysis is to be done for a structure under two lateral load patterns as 
described above. The pushover curves (POC) are to be obtained in both the orthog￾onal directions of the structural plan. So, we need a minimum of four POCs. Again, if 
there is irregularity in the structure, POC along positive and negative directions (i.e. 
load applied from the other side) will be different. So, you can have 2×2×2 or 8 POCs 
for a structure.
A POC is also called capacity curve, as it depicts the capacity of the structure at 
various displacement levels. A POC is typically drawn between the roof displacement 
and base shear. The base shear at any lateral load application step is equal to the sum 
of the applied lateral forces. A typical POC is show in Figure 6.5.
6.4.3  Multimode Pushover Analysis
We have seen in Section 6.4.2 that mode-proportional POA with one mode cannot 
represent the structural behaviours correctly. So, the need for multimodal POA 
(MPOA) was felt. Sasaki et al. (1998) reported a MPOA. Here, the load pattern 
is taken based on the modes considered. The load at a level is the mode shape 
times the mass at that level. For each load pattern, the POA is carried out and the 
response of interest is found out. In the final diagram, the demand curve and as 
many pushover curves as the number of modes considered will appear. From the 
graph, the study of the structure in different modes and the total structural behav￾iour becomes clear.
Chopra and Goel (2001, 2002, 2003a, 2003b) also reported the MPOA procedure. 
Here, the pushover curve is produced based on a particular mode of interest and then 
it is bilinearized. It is now converted to force–displacement relation for equivalent 
single degree of freedom (ESDOF) system. The peak response of interest is evaluated. 
Similarly, the steps are repeated for higher modes and finally the peak responses are 
combined by square root of sum of square (SRSS) rule. The limitations of modal 
pushover analysis (MPA) are that they consider one mode at a time and hence the 
combination result remains doubtful’ and that the P-delta effect is ignored.
FIGURE 6.5 A typical pushover curve.120 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
6.4.4  Modified Modal Pushover Analysis
Chopra and Goel (2004) reported a modified modal pushover analysis (MMPA) 
procedure. It was argued that this procedure is more realistic than the MPOA. In 
the MMPA procedure, the response contributions of higher vibration modes are 
computed by assuming the building to be linearly elastic, thus reducing the com￾putational efforts. The natural frequencies and modes for linearly elastic building 
are computed. For the first mode, the base shear versus roof displacement pushover 
curve is obtained. The pushover curve is idealized as a bilinear curve. The idealized 
pushover curve is converted to the force–displacement relation. The peak roof dis￾placement associated with the first-mode inelastic single degree of freedom (SDOF) 
system is calculated for the combined gravity load and lateral load. Now response 
is calculated for gravity load alone. The dynamic response due to various modes is 
computed. The total response is obtained by using the SRSS rule.
6.4.5  Other Types of Pushover Analyses
Gupta and Kunnath (2000) developed an adaptive pushover analysis where the 
pushover load changes with the steps. A damped elastic response spectrum is used. 
Modal analysis is done and storey forces for each of mode considered is computed. 
The storey forces are scaled with modal base shear. Nonlinear static analysis is now 
done. Member forces are now computed. If any member yields, the stiffness matrix 
is updated.
Aydinoğlu (2007) reported an incremental response spectrum analysis (IRSA) for 
multi-mode pushover analysis. It is a piecewise linear response spectrum analysis 
applied at each step of NSP. The equal displacement principle is utilized. P-delta 
effect is also considered in this method. Goel and Chopra (2005) extended the modal 
pushover analysis to compute member forces.
Kuramoto and Matsumoto (2004) reported a mode adaptive pushover analysis. 
The curves from CSM are used here. Stiffness-dependent lateral load distribution 
proportional to arbitrary mode of vibration at each loading step is applied. Higher 
mode effect is considered in the sequential analysis.
6.5 EVALUATION OF STRUCTURES: PERFORMANCE POINT
The buildings designed through the philosophy of PBD need to be evaluated to check 
if it can really attain the target design objectives under the given hazard level. We need 
to compare the target with achieved values (performance level and drift). In this con￾text, a point on the capacity curve called performance point (PP) is very important. 
The performance point is a unique point where the capacity of the structure is equal 
to the (reduced) demand on the structure. The demand imposed from earthquake gets 
changed as the structure suffers damages. The damage induces hysteresis, which 
dissipates energy. As a result, the demand reduces. This is called reduced demand.
We can now define: Performance point is a unique point where the capacity of the 
structure equals the reduced demand in the structure.Analysis for the Evaluation of Structures 121
The performance point can be described in terms of real response values (Droof, PP, Vb
) 
or in terms of spectral values (Sd,PP, Sa
). The displacement corresponding to the PP 
(Droof, PP or, Sd,PP) is called target displacement (Dt
) or design displacement (Dd
). We 
have to determine the design displacement so that we can design the structure for the 
target displacement.
The methods of determination of the displacement at PP are as follows:
(i) Displacement coefficient method (FEMA-356)
(ii) Capacity spectrum method (ATC-40)
(iii) Equivalent linearization method (FEMA-440)
(iv) Displacement modification method (FEMA-440).
These methods are discussed in the sections to follow.
6.6 DISPLACEMENT COEFFICIENT METHOD
The displacement coefficient method was originally given in FEMA-273 (1997) and 
later on incorporated in FEMA-356 (2000) with a little modification. Here the target 
displacement is obtained theoretically based on some coefficients and effective time 
period. The modal participation factor for first mode may be used in the process. The 
coefficients used accommodate the effects of equivalent single degree of freedom 
system, inelastic action, hysteresis and P- ∆ influence. For each of these influencing 
components, a separate coefficient is given. The method is straightforward, as it does 
not require construction of any diagram. However, with time, it was found that the 
method gave inconsistent results in many cases and this led to the modification of the 
coefficients as given in FEMA-440 (2004).
The method gives a formula for the computation of target displacement as given 
by Eq. (6.6.1).

For bilinearization of POC with respect to any PP, a line from the PP is extended 
backwards, while a line from the origin is drawn inclined upwards such that two lines 
meet at point A where the magnitude of base the shear force is Vy in such a way that 
(i) the line from origin cuts the capacity curve at 0.6Vy and (ii) area bounded by POC 
and first line is equal to the area bounded by second line and POC.
6.7 CAPACITY SPECTRUM METHOD
Capacity spectrum method (CSM) was given in ATC-40 document. It is an iterative 
procedure based on the geometrical construction for finding the target displacement. 
The method visually determines the performance point (PP). A general feel of the 
process is given in Figure 6.7. More details will follow. The standard ordinates of the

Notes: (1) Linear interpolation to be applied for other values of T; (2) Type 1 structure: Structures in 
which more than 30% of the storey shear at any level is resisted by any combination of the 
following components, elements, or frames: ordinary moment-resisting frames, concentrically 
braced frames, frames with partially restrained connections, tension-only braces, unreinforced 
masonry walls, shear-critical, piers, and spandrels of reinforced concrete or masonry. Rest is taken 
as type 2 structures.124 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
capacity curve are roof displacement and base shear. Making some transformation of 
the ordinate values, the same can be converted to spectral displacement and spectral 
acceleration. Because of the use of spectral values, the method is called the capacity 
spectrum method.
Figure 6.7 shows a capacity curve superimposed with a demand curve, on Sd – Sa
plot. In design codes, the demand curve is 5% damped demand curve. The structure 
receives energy from ground motion, which gets dissipated through hysteresis, as 
damage sets in. As seismic action keeps rising to higher level, the structures undergo 
increasing damages. The damage reduces the stiffness and hence increases the time 
period. This is called period lengthening. If the lengthened period corresponds to the 
falling parabolic part of the demand diagram, the demand on the structure decreases. 
The damage is analogous to the increase in damping. So, we can interpret the reduc￾tion in demand to be due to increased damping. The decreased demand is called 
FIGURE 6.7 A general picture of CSM showing performance point.
FIGURE 6.6 Bilinearization of capacity curve.Analysis for the Evaluation of Structures 125
reduced demand, shown by dotted line in Figure 6.7. We shall discuss how to arrive 
at the reduced demand corresponding to a particular damage state, in subsequent 
sections. The intersection point of the reduced demand curve with the capacity curve 
is the performance point (PP). The significance of PP is this that here the (reduced) 
demand in the structure is equal to the capacity of the structure. So, corresponding to 
this point is the ideal displacement for which the structure should be designed for a 
desired PL (damage state). This is the target or design displacement.
Note that the radial lines from the centre of the Figure 6.7 indicate constant period 
lines. The reason for this is that the relationship between Sd and Sa is given as 
S S a d = ω2 , where ω π = 2 /T. If T is constant, then the relationship becomes analo￾gous to y m= x style of a straight line passing through the origin. Hence, the constant 
period lines are radial lines from the origin in the plot.
6.7.1  ADRS Format of Capacity Spectrum and Demand Spectrum
Traditional POC is roof displacement (say, in m) versus base shear (say, in kN). The 
traditional demand spectrum is time period (s) versus spectral acceleration ratio (S g a / ). 
If we wish to superimpose the two diagrams in a single plot, it is not possible as the 
axes values are all different. We can convert the axes parameters by using dynam￾ical equations so that the x-axis parameters are the same for both demand diagram 
and capacity diagram. A similar treatment can be applied for y-axis too. Now the 
two diagrams can be superimposed in the same plot. The conversion equations are 
Eqs. (6.7.1.1) to (6.7.1.3). Such converted axes parameters are called acceleration￾displacement response spectrum (ADRS) format. ADRS format is actually Sd – Sa
format.

6.7.2  Damping Corresponding to a Damage State
We have discussed the process of bilinearization of POC in Section 6.6. Here we find 
the damping corresponding to a damage state that is designated as the PP. The dis￾placement corresponding to the PP is target displacement Dt 
(or, design displacement 
Dd
). Consider Figure 6.9 where the bilinearized POC is shown. The bilinearization 
gives us the yield base shear Vy
 and yield displacement Dy
. The POC shown as dark 
curve has been bilinearized by the dotted lines OA and AB. After bilinearization, the 
hysteretic loop is given by parallelogram GBEF and area under the POC is equal to 
area of quadrantal parallelogram OABH. For the sake of brevity, we shall represent 
the PP by (dpi, api) and yield point A by (dy
, ay
).
The energy dissipated in one complete hysteresis cycle ( ED ) is equal to the area 
under the parallelogram GBEF, which is four times the area of one parallelogram

However, ATC-40 gives reduction factors for three types of buildings. The reduction

6.7.3  Determination of Performance Point
There are three methods (named as procedure A, B, C) given in ATC-40 for finding 
the PP. Here we shall discuss the first method, which is assumed to be the most 
accurate one. The steps involved are described below.
Data given are: Designed/existing building; 5% damped demand diagram as 
hazard level.
(1) Generate the POC for the building and convert it to ADRS format. Convert the 
demand diagram to ADRS format. Superimpose both in the same plot.
(2) Consider an arbitrary PP say (d a p1 p1 , ). The selection of the point may depend 
on the judgement of how much damage the building may suffer under MCE 
level of ground shaking, or in other words, its PL.
(3) Bilinearize the capacity curve and obtain yield point (d a y y , ).
(4) Obtain damping from Eq. (6.7.2.3).
(5) Obtain the reduced demand diagram by multiplying the ordinates of demand 
diagram by factor given by Eq. (6.7.2.5).
(6) Note the intersection point of reduced demand diagram with capacity curve, 
say (d a p2 p2 , ).
if, 0.95 d d d p1 p2 p1 ≤ ≤ 1 0. 5
acceptable PP is (d a p2 p2 , );
Else, go to step (2) with new PP (d a p3 p3 , ).
The process is explained in Figure 6.11.

Displacement modification procedures estimate the total maximum displacement 
of the oscillator by multiplying the elastic response, assuming initial linear proper￾ties and damping by one or more coefficients. The coefficients are typically derived 
empirically from series of nonlinear response history analyses of oscillators with 
varying periods and strengths (FEMA-440).
FIGURE 6.11 Iteration for obtaining PP.Analysis for the Evaluation of Structures 131
6.9 EQUIVALENT LINEARIZATION METHOD (FEMA-440)
Equivalent linearization technique assumes that the maximum total displacement 
(elastic plus inelastic) of an SDOF oscillator can be estimated by the elastic response 
of an oscillator with a larger period and damping than the original. These procedures 
use estimates of ductility to compute effective period and effective damping.
The steps in the method are highlighted below.
(1) Consider the demand curve and capacity curve. Convert them to the ADRS 
format.
(2) Consider an arbitrary initial PP, say (d a p1 p1 , ). The selection of the point may 
depend on the judgement of how much damage the building may suffer under 
MCE level of ground shaking, or in other words, its PL.
(3) Bilinearize the capacity curve and obtain yield point (d a y y , ).

, is that corresponding to di on the capacity curve 
(see Figure 6.12).
(6) Compare the estimated maximum displacement, di , with the initial (or pre￾vious) assumption. If it is within acceptable tolerance, the performance point 
corresponds to ai and di . If it is not within acceptable tolerance, then repeat 
the process from Step 2 using ai and di or some other selected point, as a 
starting point.
6.10 PERFORMANCE POINT AND PERFORMANCE LEVEL OF 
STRUCTURES
After carrying out the nonlinear static procedure (NSP) we get the PP. This will help 
us know the PL of the building as a whole. Consider Figure 6.13. The PP has been 
obtained by using any of the NSPs. The damage states IO, LS and CP are also shown. 
Point IO corresponds to the displacement beyond which members exhibit LS PL. 
Similarly, the concept applies to LS and CP states. Now, the PP here is beyond IO and 
with LS states. So, it is building of LS PL.
6.11 TIME HISTORY ANALYSIS
The dynamic evaluation of the structure is carried by POA and time history ana￾lysis. Time history analysis may be linear time history analysis (LTHA) or nonlinear 
time history analysis (NLTHA). Time history analysis is a step-by-step analysis. The 
record interval of ground motion is further split into finer segments and analysis is 
done for satisfying dynamic equilibrium at each step for each node. On analysis, 
we get the displacement response history, velocity response history and acceleration 
response history. The time history analysis enables us to obtain quantities as (but not 
limited to) drift, floor and roof response histories, hinge results, variation of base 
shear and other quantities and floor spectra. From the hinge results at last step of time 
history analysis, we get the performance level of the structure. The calculation of 
interstorey drift ratio (IDR) is explained below.
FIGURE 6.13 PL of a building.Analysis for the Evaluation of Structures 133
Let u t i ( ) denote displacement history of i-th floor and u t i+ ( ) 1 that of (i + 1)-th 
floor.
Drift vector = u t u t i+ i ( ) − ( ) 1
IDR vector = drift vector/ hs .
where, hs is interstorey height between i-th and (i +1)-th floor.
It may be mentioned that floor spectra are the average floor response spectra of 
floors when any floor is subjected to acceleration time history of that floor. Floor 
mounted equipment are to be designed for average floor spectra and not design spec￾trum of code.
6.11.1  How Many Earthquakes?
For evaluation a structure through time history analysis, the number of earthquakes to 
be considered in the analysis is to be decided. For incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), 
again a different suite of ground motions to be considered. More ground motions lead 
to more accurate prediction of response covering record-to-record variability.
6.11.1.1 ASCE-7-16 Provisions
Prior to 2016 version, this document prescribed three ground motions and later 
on it prescribed seven ground motions. When three ground motions were to be 
taken, the maximum response was to be adopted for engineering purposes. When 
seven grounds motions were prescribed, the average response could be used. In 
ASCE-7-16 version, 11 ground motions have been prescribed, and the average 
response is to be reported.
6.11.1.2 FEMA P-695 Provisions
These provisions are used for incremental dynamic analysis leading to fragility evalu￾ation. The ground motions are divided into two categories, namely, near field records 
and far field records. In far field records, there are 22 recorded ground motions. The 
magnitude of the earthquake varies from 6.5 to 7.6. The earthquakes are recorded 
earthquakes in the United States, Japan, Turkey, Italy, Taiwan and Iran.
In near field records, there are 28 recorded ground motions. The earthquake mag￾nitude varies from 6.5 to 7.6. The earthquakes in the set are recorded earthquakes 
in the United States, Turkey, Italy, Taiwan and Canada. There is no strict consensus 
about the distance of fault up to which it can be called a near field. Generally, it is 
taken as 10–15 km from fault source. Near field structures are prone to wave action 
of earthquakes. The tall structures in near field distance may show resonance during 
earthquake.
Near field records have higher ground velocity which may lead to higher 
damages.134 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures

6.13 CLOSURE
The results of a pushover analysis can sometimes be misleading unless they are 
interpreted correctly. It must be emphasized that the pushover analysis is approximate 
in nature and is based on static loading. As such, it cannot represent dynamic phe￾nomena with a high degree of accuracy. It may not detect some important deformation 
modes that can occur in a structure subjected to severe earthquakes, and it may exag￾gerate others. Inelastic dynamic response may differ significantly from predictions 
based on invariant or adaptive static load patterns, particularly if higher mode effects 
become important. The influence of higher modes, which is neglected in the standard 
pushover analysis, varies for different response parameters (FEMA-440).

Direct Displacement￾Based Design of RC 
Frame Buildings
7.1 INTRODUCTION
The displacement-based design in which the target design displacement is evaluated 
directly through the application of mechanics, may be called as direct displacement￾based design (DDBD).
Though there are some variants of DDBD, the one developed by Pettinga and 
Priestley (2005) for RC frame buildings is handy and easy to use. This method has 
been described in this chapter. It is to be noted that the methodology of Pettinga 
and Priestley (2005) addresses interstorey drift θd ( ) as the only design performance 
objective.
For designating a point on nonlinear part of force–deformation curve (Figure 7.1a), 
secant stiffness or effective stiffness ( ke ) is used. The target displacement corresponds 
to some intended damage level or damage state of the structure. Such damage state 
corresponds to a particular displacement value. This is the target displacement (∆d ). 
The initial stiffness of the structure k and the initial time period of the structure is ini￾tially T (elastic time period); but these change as the structure reaches the nonlinear 
state. The time period corresponding to any point on the nonlinear part of the force–
deformation curve is designated as effective time period (Te ). The elastic time period 
relationship in general is given by Eq. (7.1.1).
T m
k = 2π (7.1.1)
Eq. (7.1.1.) may be written as
k m
T = 4 2
2 π (7.1.2)
For the target point (or any other point on the nonlinear part of the force–
deformation curve), we can rewrite Eq. (7.1.2) as Eq. (7.1.3).
7138 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
k m
T e
e
e
= 4 2
2 π (7.1.3)
In Eq. (7.1.3), ke is effective stiffness, me is effective mass (related to equiva￾lent SDOF system), Te is effective time period corresponding to the target point. 
The value of Te is obtained from displacement spectra (constructed from design 
spectra) corresponding to the design displacement and system effective damping 
(Figure 7.1(b)).
From the basic stiffness relationship, with Vb
 as base shear, we can write,
V k b e d = ∆ (7.1.4)
Consider the 3D frame building in Figure 7.2(a). It has masses and at different floor 
levels and stiffnesses of different storeys. From dynamical relations, it is possible to 
convert the 3D building to an equivalent single degree of freedom (ESDOF) system 
(Fig. 7.2b). 
FIGURE 7.2 (a) MDOF building, (b) equivalent SDOF system and (c) force–deformation 
behaviour.
FIGURE 7.1 (a) Force–deformation curve and (b) displacement spectra.Direct Displacement-Based Design of RC Frame Buildings 139
The ESDOF system shall have an equivalent single mass me ( ) and equivalent height 
He ( ). The equivalent height corresponds to an equivalent overturning moment repli￾cating the overturning moment of the real building. The ESDOF system shall undergo 
a displacement compatible to and arising out of the dynamic properties of the real 
building. The displacement pattern of the real building depends upon its shape profile 
(generally first mode profile) and the amount of drift it undergoes. The total angular 
displacement of the ESDOF system is the angular design drift (θd ).
As per Figure 7.2(b), the yield displacement (∆y ) of the ESDOF system is given by 
Eq. (7.1.5).
∆y yF He = θ (7.1.5)
As per Priestley (2003), the frame yield rotation (θ yF ) is given by Eq. (7.1.6), in 
which ε y is yield strain of rebar steel ( = f
y / Es ), l
b is length of beam in the direction 
of displacement considered, and hb is depth of the beam.

In Eqs. (7.1.7) to (7.1.9), ∆d is target design displacement, mi is mass of i-th floor, 
n is total number stories in the building, ∆i is displacement of i-th floor as per shape 
profile considered and, hi is height of i-th floor above the base.140 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
Note that for building with beams of unequal lengths, Eq. (7.1.6) may be applied 
for each beam length separately, and then the average value of yield rotation may be 
obtained.
7.2 SHAPE PROFILE AND DISPLACEMENT PROFILE
The first mode shape profiles for buildings have been suggested by researchers. Let 
us denote φi as shape coefficient and ∆i as displacement for i-th floor. The shape 
profile suggested by Priestley and Calvi (1997) for RC frame buildings is given by 
Eqs. (7.2.1) to (7.2.3).

Shape profile has been depicted in Figure 7.3(a). The displacement profile of the 
building (designated by ∆i ) is a function of shape profile and displacement due to 
drift. The effect of drift is taken into account through the displacement of the storey 
with largest storey height, or largest mass (called critical storey). The critical storey 
has been explained in Figure 7.3.
The critical storey is defined as the storey having critical (maximum) mass and/or 
critical interstorey height (maximum interstorey height). Denoting the storey height 
of critical storey as hsc, the lateral drift of critical storey is given by
∆c d sc = θ h (7.2.6)Direct Displacement-Based Design of RC Frame Buildings 141
Denoting the shape coefficient of critical storey as φc , the lateral displacement of 
i-th floor is taken as proportional to the critical storey parameters and is given as 
Eq. (7.2.7).

7.3 LOAD COMBINATION AND DESIGN
The loads considered are those of gravity loads and seismic loads. As the structure is 
in nonlinear stage, the expected strengths of materials are to be used in design. The 
load combinations are:
DL + LL
FIGURE 7.3 (a) First mode shape profile. (b) and (c) Frame with critical storey and 
displacement profile.142 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
DL LL Fx + ±
DL LL Fy + ±
where Fx and Fy are forces at floor levels in two orthogonal directions of the building 
and as given in Eqs. (7.2.8) and (7.2.9).
The expected material strengths for materials are used in design. The expected 
material strengths for concrete ( f
ce ) and rebar ( f
se ) are given by FEMA-356 as,
f f ce ck = 1 5. (7.3.1a)
f f se y = 1 25. (7.3.1b)
Example 7.3.1 For the building plan shown in Figure 7.4, compute the frame yield 
rotation. The grade of rebar steel is Fe415 and overall depth of all beams is 500 mm.

7.4 EQUIVALENT DAMPING OF THE BUILDING SYSTEM
The equivalent damping corresponding to the target point of the building comprises 
of material damping and hysteretic damping. The material damping for concrete is 
taken as 5% of the critical value. The hysteretic damping is a function of ductility and 
has been suggested by Pettinga and Priestley (2005) as Eq. (7.4.1).

7.4.1  Evaluation of the Performance of the Designed Building
The building designed as per DDBD needs to be evaluated for its actual performance 
and has to be compared with the target objectives. The evaluation of the building 
shall be carried out with (i) nonlinear static analysis (pushover analysis), (ii) linear 
dynamic analysis and (iii) nonlinear dynamic analysis. The drifts are computed from 
the displacement histories at various floors. Drift can be linear or nonlinear. If the 
achieved drift differs by more than 20 from target drift, redesign is necessary.
Eq. (7.4.3) is plotted in Figure 7.5. The figure shows the nature of variation of 
equivalent damping with displacement ductility. The figure may be used for the com￾putation of equivalent damping from a given displacement ductility. It may be noted 
that Eq. (7.4.3) and Figure 7.5 are valid for RC structures.
7.5 NUMERICAL EXAMPLES
For the computation of ESDOF system properties, the data can be put in the tabular 
form shown in Table 7.1.
Example 7.5.1 Find the design forces at each floor level for the 8-storey building, the 
plan of which is shown in Figure 7.6. The ground storey height is 4 m and other storey 
height is 3.5 m. The seismic weight in floors is 10 kN/m2 and that in roof is 6 kN/m2
. 
The grade of rebar steel is Fe415 and overall depth of all beams is 600 mm. Design 
drift is 2.2%. The building is to be designed at 0.36g level of Indian seismic code.
Solution
The seismic weight in each floor = (3 × 6) × × (2 5) × = 10 1800 kN.
Seismic mass in each floor = 1800 × 103
/9.81 = 183500 kg.
The seismic weight in roof = (3 × 6) × × (2 5) × = 6 1080 kN.
Seismic mass in roof = 1080 × 103
/9.81 = 110100 kg.

Example 7.5.2 Find the design forces for the 18-storey building, the plan of which 
is shown in Figure 7.8. The ground storey height is 4.5 m and other storey height is 
constant to 3.4 m. The seismic weight in floors is 20 kN/m2 and that in roof is 10 kN/
m2
. The grade of rebar steel is Fe500 and overall depth of all beams is 800 mm in the 
long direction and 700 mm in the short direction. Design drift is 2%. The building is 
to be designed at 0.55g level of Euro-Code.
Solution
The seismic weight in each floor = (6 × 5.5) × (4 × 5) × 20 = 13200 kN.
Seismic mass in each floor = 13200 × 103
/9.81 = 1345566 kg = 1345.566 ton-mass.
The seismic weight in roof = (6 × 5.5) × (4 × 5) × 10 = 6600 kN.
Seismic mass in roof = 6600 × 103
/9.81 = 672783 kg = 672.783 ton-mass

7.6 TWO EXPRESSIONS OF EQUIVALENT DAMPING
Two formulae of equivalent damping based on ductility, for RC frame buildings, are 
available: Eq. (7.6.1) given by Pettinga and Priestley (2005) and Eq. (7.6.2) given by 
Priestley et al. (2007). These two equations are plotted in Figure 7.11.

7.7 VARIATION OF ∆d
 WITH θd
It is worthwhile to have an idea about how the design displacement changes with 
design drift. The design displacement increases with target drift and height of 
building. It may so happen that the design displacement is so high that we do 
not get a solution for effective time period for the computed effective damping; 
the horizontal line through ∆d remains above the displacement spectrum line 
corresponding to ξe .
For the purpose of drawing a plot between θd and ∆d , we consider a 12-storey 
building with ground storey height 4.3 m and other storey height as 3.3 m. The floor 
mass is taken as 10,000 kg and roof mass as 7000 kg. The value of θd is varied from 
0.5% to 4% increasing it at the rate 0.5%. One sample table is shown in Table 7.2. 
Other tables are not shown for brevity. Finally, all the points between θd and ∆d are 
plotted.

is because of Eqs. (7.2.6) and (7.2.7), which are linear. However, the slope of the 
straight line will vary with different buildings.
The equivalent mass or equivalent height of the building does not change with θd , 
as θd has no effect on mass, and equivalent height arises out of overturning moment 
in real building and ESDOF system.
7.8 CASES WHEN DESIGN DISPLACEMENT IS MORE THAN THE 
SPECTRAL DISPLACEMENT
It may so happen that the design displacement (∆d ) is more than the corner period 
(Tc
) displacement (∆c
) of spectral displacement line corresponding to equivalent

damping. Two cases may arise. These two cases are highlighted here after Priestley 
et al. (2007).
Case I: When ∆d is more than 5% damped elastic displacement at corner point
(∆c5 )
This case is shown in Figure 7.13. In this figure, the corner period displacement 
at 5% damped spectrum is 1.04 m, whereas the design displacement is 1.06 m. This 
actually indicates that the system is elastic.
In this case the design base shear is given by Eq. (7.8.1).
V K b elastic = ∆c5 (7.8.1)
In Eq. (7.8.1),
Kelastic = elastic stiffness of the system
∆c5 = corner period spectrum displacement corresponding to 5% damping.
Case II: When ∆d is more than displacement at corner point (∆c ) corresponding to 
equivalent damping
The case is described through Figure 7.14. The design displacement is ∆d (= 0.85 
m) and equivalent damping is 20%. The displacement corresponding to corner period 
in 20% damping line is ∆c (= 0.65 m). The steps in solution are as below:

target drift of 2.5%. The floor mass is 10,000 kg and the roof mass is 7000 kg. The

be designed for EC-8 design spectrum for type B soil and 0.36g seismicity level. 
f
y = 500 MPa; length of beam is 5 m and beam depth is 600 mm. In the initial pre￾design model of the building, a force of 10,000 kN was applied laterally at roof level 
which caused a displacement of 0.45 m at roof level.

Figure 7.16 shows that the design displacement is higher than the displacement at 
the corner period for displacement spectrum at 18.1% damping; it is also below the 164 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures

not exist. Refer to case II of Section 7.8.
The case is described through Figure 7.16. The design displacement is ∆d (= 0.644

in 18.1% damping line is ∆c (= 0.49 m). The steps in solution are as follows:

7.9 BASE SHEAR CONSIDERING P-DELTA EFFECT
The basics of P-delta effect have been discussed in Section 4.7 of Chapter 4. Here 
we discuss the calculation of base shear considering the P-delta effect. Consider 
Figure 7.19.
Let
Vb = base shear as per DDBD method
Vb∆ = additional base shear caused by P-delta effect.
It is evident that P-delta effect causes overturning moment equal to P∆ . This 
overturning moment is counterbalanced by Vb∆ .
FIGURE 7.17 EC-8 displacement spectrum for Example 7.8.2 (second case).166 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
So, we can write
P V ∆ = b∆H (7.9.1)
where H is the height of the system.

chapter. The method is simple to understand and apply. The DDBD method can be 
applied to other structures as well, where the methodology slightly differs. It may be 
noted that DDBD method takes only one target objective, namely, drift. Also, it does 
not give any insight on how to get the initial member sizes.

DDBD for Dual System
8.1 INTRODUCTION
A dual system building consists of shear walls and frame elements. It is also known 
as frame-shear wall system. Figure 8.1 shows a dual system building. Shear wall is a 
structural RC wall which carries the lateral forces arising out of earthquake or wind, 
in its own plane. Frame elements consist of beams and columns. Shear wall takes 
the major portion of the lateral base shear. Frame elements are primarily designed 
for carrying the vertical loads. However, as the frame is monolithically cast with the 
walls, the frame also carries a portion of the lateral base shear. Typically, 25–35% of 
the base shear is allowed to be carried by the frame, and the remaining portion is to 
be carried by the shear walls. For example, if the frame carries 30% of the base shear, 
the shear wall will carry 70% of the base shear.
Shear walls are like cantilever deep beams. The horizontal length of wall is the depth 
of such a deep beam. Shear wall can dissipate a large amount of energy absorbed from 
the ground motion through hysteresis. In the preceding chapters, we have discussed the 
DDBD method. In this chapter, the DDBD method primarily developed by Sullivan 
et al. (2006) for dual system is discussed. The thickness of shear wall is small, gener￾ally in the range of 150–350 mm. The length of shear wall may be many metres and 
the height is equal to the height of the storey. It may be noted that the length of wall 
means the horizontal dimension of the wall. Shear wall is continuously provided along 
the height of the building. The placement of shear wall in plan should be symmetrical 
and each wall needs another wall as a shadow on the opposite side of the plan. Shear 
wall provided at the periphery of the plan can resist more torsion.
8.2 FRAME–SHEAR WALL INTERACTION
The frame and wall are monolithically cast. As such, they have to deflect together. 
But the frame and wall bending behaviours are not identical. A frame system with 
rigid diaphragm and beams bends in a shear mode. This is depicted in Figure 8.2. 
The shear wall being a cantilever deep beam bends in a cantilever bending mode. The 
curvatures of bending for wall and frame are opposite to each other. If the frame has 
convexity of curvature outside, the wall will have the convexity of curvature inside. 
During earthquake shaking, such curvature will change sides. The wall and the frame 
8170 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
thus undergo a tug of war like situation while responding to external actions. This is 
called frame–shear wall interaction. Because of this interaction, the wall develops a 
point of zero bending moment at some height, which is called the inflection height.
In Figure 8.2, the frame displays the shear bending mode while the wall is showing 
cantilever bending. The convexity of deflected curve for frame is on the right side 
while that for the wall is on the left side. The interaction of frame–wall makes a 
bending moment diagram, which changes sign for wall bending. The point where 
the BMD changes sign is the inflection point. The height of inflection is shown in 
FIGURE 8.2 Frame–shear wall interaction: (a) frame bending in shear mode, (b) wall 
bending as cantilever and (c) BMD.
FIGURE 8.1 Dual system: (a) 3D view of building and (b) sectional plan of a shear wall.DDBD for Dual System 171
Figure 8.2(c). Above the inflection height, the frame pushes the wall towards the left, 
while below the inflection point, the wall pulls the frame to the right. In analysis and 
design, it is necessary to compute the height of inflection ( hinf ).
8.3 DDBD FOR DUAL SYSTEM
The DDBD for a dual system after Sullivan et al. (2006a, 2006b) is discussed below. 
The design method takes drift (θd ) as the only target design criterion.
In RC frame building, we started with shape profile of the building (Chapter 7). 
Here, we shall consider the yield displacement of walls first. The final displacement 
of any floor is the sum of yield displacement of wall at that floor and additional dis￾placement caused by drift. In Figure 8.3(a), an MDOF dual system is shown. The 
MDOF system can be converted to an ESDOF system as shown in Figure 8.3(b). The 
equivalent system properties have been discussed in the previous chapters. The yield 
curvature of the wall (φ yw) is gven by Eq. (8.3.1). Here, ε y is yield strain of rebar of 
wall, Lw is horizontal length of wall.

(8.3.1)
The displacement profile of the wall is obtained from the yield displacement of walls 
(∆iy ) in different floors as expressed by Eqs. (8.3.2) and (8.3.3). The frame yield 
rotation is given by Eq. (8.3.4), as was discussed in the previous chapter. The final 
deflections at floor levels (∆i
) is given by Eq. (8.3.5).

The ductility of the frame is given by Eq. (8.3.9). The ductility of the frame varies 
with storey. If the beam depth is constant over the floors, then the average value of 
frame ductility may be taken. Ductility of wall is given by Eq. (8.3.10). Here, Lp is 
the plastic hinge length of wall, db the diameter of rebar in wall. The smaller value of 
Lp out of Eqs. (8.3.10b) and (8.3.10c) is to be taken.

8.4 EXAMPLES
Example 8.4.1 Find the lateral design forces in floors for a 10-storey dual system, 
which is to be designed for a 2.5% drift. Take fy as 500 MPa, diameter of longitudinal 
rebar as 20 mm, interstorey height as 3.4 m and ground storey height as 4.4 m. Floor 
mass is 10,000 kg in each floor and the roof mass is 6000 kg. Assume that the frame 
takes 35% of the base shear. Length of the wall is 5 m, length of the beam is 5 m and 
depth of the beam is 0.6 m. Take post-yield stiffness ratio as 0.1. Use EC-8 spectrum 
for soil type B at 0.4g seismicity level.
Solution: Table Ex8.4.1.1 is prepared for the computation of height of inflection. For 
this purpose, absolute values of forces and moments are not necessary. The relative 
values in proportion of mass and height of floors is sufficient for the purpose. In this 
table, column (6) is the cumulative sum of column (5) items. Putting these lateral 
forces at respective floors, the moments produced by the forces are put in column (7). 
Column (7) is obtained from Eq. (8.4.1), where, MOT is frame overturning moment.
M M V h h OTi OT i t i i i = + ( − ) , +1 , +1 +1 (8.4.1)
As frame is designed to take 35% of base shear, the frame force remains constant at 
0.35 in column (8). As wall shear is the total shear less frame shear, column (9) is 
obtained by subtracting column (8) from column (6). Column (10) is the moment 
produced by forces at different heights in column (9) and it can be computed using 
Eq. (8.4.2).
M M V h h Wi W i W i i i = + ( − ) , +1 , +1 +1 (8.4.2)
A graph is drawn between wall moment and height of the building, which is shown in 
Figure 8.4. From the graph, inflection height (hinf
) is 21.6 m. MW = 11.491 kN-m, 
MOTF = 23.47 kN-m.DDBD for Dual System 175

HereVt is 0.1Vb = 0.1 × 268615 = 26862 kN, which is to be provided for roof level 
only. Rest of the 90% of the base shear is distributed over all floors including 
the roof.
Roof level lateral design force = 26862 + 0.9 × 268615 × 585000/7482000 = 45764 kN.
Lateral design force at 19th floor = 0.9 × 268615 × 679800/7482000 = 21965 kN. 
Similarly, calculations are done for other floors.
The floor lateral forces are shown in Table Ex8.4.2.4.
Example 8.4.3 Find the lateral design forces in floors for a 15-storey dual system 
shown in Figure 8.8. The design drift is 3%. Take fy as 550 MPa, diameter of rebar 
as 25 mm, interstorey height as 3.3 m and ground storey height as 4.4 m. The floor 
seismic weight is 5 kN/m2 and that of roof is 4 kN/m2
. Assume that the frame takes 
32% of the base shear. Use EC-8 design spectrum at the 0.7g level. Depths of beam 
along the short and long directions are 0.9 m and 0.7 m, respectively.
Solution: The wall lengths are different in two directions of the plan. Seismic mass 
in each floor = 36 × 21 × 5/9.81 = 385 kN-s2
/m, and seismic mass of roof = 36 × 21 × 
4/9.81 = 308 kN-s2
/m.
ε y = 550/200000 = 0.00275.
Long direction of the plan
LW = 12 m, l
b = 6 m, hb = 0.7 m.

Short direction of the plan
LW = 7 m, l
b = 7 m, hb = 0.9 m.
The data for computation of the inflection height is same as that in the long direction. 
From Table Ex8.4.3.1, MOTF = 34.5 kN-m (relative) and MW = 18.305 kN-m (rela￾tive). hinf = 34.1 m (this does not change with direction).
The ESDOF system properties differ in two directions because of the involvement 
of wall yield displacement, which contains φ yW , which in turn uses the length of the

In this chapter, the DDBD method for the dual system has been described. Examples 
are given for clarifying the application of the design philosophy. In dual system, most 
of the ductility arises out of shear wall. After the design, the actual performance of the 
building is to be evaluated by carrying out nonlinear analyses.

9 Unified Performance￾Based Design of RC 
Frame Buildings
9.1 INTRODUCTION
In the preceding two chapters, we have described the DDBD method for frame 
building and dual system building. The DDBD methodology developed by Pettinga 
and Priestley (2005), as described in Chapter 7, is a handy design process for RC 
frame buildings. Similarly, the DDBD method for RC dual system (Sullivan et al., 
2006a, 2006b), as described in Chapter 8, is an innovative design process for the dual 
system. However, these methods addressed only drift as the single target performance 
objective. The performance level (PL), which is another important design objective 
indicating the degree of damage, is not included in these methods. Furthermore, there 
is no guideline for taking the initial sizes of the members. As such, a large number of 
iterations may be required before arriving at the final member sizes. In each iteration, 
the whole design procedure, including the computation of ESDOF system properties, 
is to be repeated. These limitations have been overcome in unified performance-based 
design (UPBD) (Choudhury, 2007; Choudhury and Singh, 2013).
The term “unified performance-based design (UPBD)” was first coined by 
Choudhury (2007). The name signifies that both drift and performance level 
are addressed in the design method. The UPBD method for RC dual system was 
proposed by Choudhury (2007). Choudhury and Singh (2013) devised the UPBD 
method for RC frame buildings. This chapter describes the UPBD method for RC 
frame buildings.
In the UPBD method, the target design objectives for RC frame buildings are: 
(i) interstorey drift θd ( ) and, (ii) member performance level. The member perform￾ance level is designated in terms of plastic rotation in the members. As per cap￾acity design (see Chapter 2), principle of “weak-beam strong-column” for buildings 
is applied so that the columns do not undergo inelastic deformation. It is the beam 
which has to form plastic hinges and dissipate energy through hysteresis. Thus, the 
member performance level for RC frame buildings can be expressed in terms of the 
plastic rotation of beams alone. In the following section, it is demonstrated how both 
these parameters, namely, drift and performance level, can be incorporated into the 
design formulation as the target design objectives. We shall also see how the member 
sizes are also given by the theoretical approach.Unified Performance-Based Design of RC Frame Buildings 197
Consider force–displacement relationship of a structure as shown Figure 9.1. 
For designating a structure corresponding to an accepted damage level (point P in 
Figure 9.1a), effective stiffness (ke
) or secant stiffness is to be used. The target dis￾placement corresponding to the damage level is ∆d . The time period of the structure 
is initially T (elastic time period), but this changes as the structure reaches a nonlinear 
state. The time period corresponding to any point on the nonlinear part of the force–
deformation curve is designated as the effective time period (Te
). Instead of slope of 
tangent to point P, it is the slope of the line joining P from the origin. The time period 
relationship, in general, is given by Eq. (9.1.1).
T m
k = 2π (9.1.1)
Eq. (9.1.1) may be written as
k m
T = 4 2

For the target point (or any other point on the nonlinear part of the force–deformation 
curve) we can rewrite the Eq. (9.1.2) as Eq. (9.1.3):

2 π (9.1.3)
In Eq. (9.1.3), ke is effective stiffness, me is effective mass for equivalent single 
degree of freedom (ESDOF) system and Te is effective time period corresponding 
to the target point.
From basic stiffness relationship, with Vb
 as base shear, we can write as Eq. (9.1.4).
V k b e d = ∆ (9.1.4)

In Figure 9.1(b), displacement spectra corresponding to the design spectrum is shown. 
As shown in this figure, corresponding to the design displacement and associated 
damping, the effective time period can be found out.
9.2 THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT OF UPBD METHOD
Consider the 3D frame building shown in Figure 9.2(a). The building has masses at 
different floor levels and stiffnesses of members at various stories. From the struc￾tural dynamics theory, it is possible to convert the 3D building to an ESDOF system 
(Figure 9.2b). The ESDOF system shall have an equivalent single mass (me
), equiva￾lent height (He
) and equivalent stiffness (ke
). The equivalent height corresponds to 
an equivalent overturning moment replicating the overturning moment of the real 
building. The ESDOF system shall undergo a displacement compatible to and arising 
out of the displacement pattern of the real building. The displacement pattern of real 
building depends upon its shape profile (generally, the first mode profile) and the 
amount of interstorey drift. The total angular displacement of the ESDOF system is 
the summation of the elastic angular displacement and plastic angular displacement. 
The total angular displacement (angular rotation) of the ESDOF system is the angular 
design drift (θd
). Design drift means the interstorey drift value for which the building 
is to be designed. Thus, the design drift is the summation of the maximum elastic 
angular drift of the frame (θyF) and plastic rotation of the frame (θp
). The above con￾cept in reference to Figure 9.2b can be expressed by Eq. (9.2.1).
θ θ θ d yF p = + (9.2.1)
As the entire plastic rotation of the ESDOF system arises out of the plastic rotation 
of beams (θpb) [columns to remain elastic as per capacity design], Eq. (9.2.1) can be 
written as Eq. (9.2.2)
FIGURE 9.2 (a) MDOF building, (b) equivalent SDOF system and (c) force–displacement 
response.Unified Performance-Based Design of RC Frame Buildings 199

θ θ (9.2.4)
Eq. (9.2.4) gives a depth of beam that satisfies both interstorey drift and performance 
level. The performance level is expressed in terms of plastic rotation of members 
(here beams). The width of the beam is kept from half to two-thirds of beam depth as 
per practice. Thus, the beam size is known at the beginning of design.

We can rewrite Eq. (9.2.4) as Eq. (9.3.1):

θ θ (9.3.1)
To plot this equation, we need to decide the range of drift that shall correspond to a 
particular performance level. Referring to Table C1-3 of FEMA-356, the drift for ver￾tical members corresponding to different PLs are as follows:
IO: 1% transient drift with negligible permanent drift
LS: 2% transient drift with 1% permanent drift and
CP: 4% transient or permanent drift.200 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
The permanent drift implies plastic rotation. As per the above guidelines, we shall 
assume the following ranges of drifts for different PLs:
IO: 1–1.5% (total drift)
LS: 1.5–3% (total drift),
CP: 3–4% (total drift).
Drift less than 1% may be assumed to be too stringent for practical design purposes. 
For any given PL, the maximum allowable value of θpb remains constant. For a given 
grade of steel ey
 is known and is fixed. So, as per Eq. (9.3.1), a graph can be drawn 
between hb
/l
b ratio and θd
 by varying θd
. Let us take Fe415 steel ( f
y
 = 415 MPa) and 
IO performance level. Here, ey
 = 415/(2 × 105
) = 0.002075. The average plastic rota￾tion for beams for IO PL as per ASCE-SEI-41-17 (Table 10-7 of this document) for 
compliant buildings is 0.00625 radian. Such values are also available in FEMA-356. 
So, for IO PL, Eq. (9.3.1) takes the form (9.3.1a).

The graph of corresponding to Eq. (9.3.1.a) is the curve AB as shown in Figure 9.3. 
So, AB corresponds to IO PL. The average plastic rotation of the beam for com￾pliant buildings for LS PL is 0.02 radian. Putting this in Eq. (9.3.1), curve CD is 
obtained, which corresponds to LS PL. Similarly, curve EF is drawn, which corres￾ponds to CP PL.
From the end of IO performance line, a horizontal line BM is drawn. Now for part 
CM of LS PL, the same h l b b / ratio can give IO PL as well. Naturally, one would 
go for IO instead of LS for this part of the curve, otherwise it will not be judicious 
or economical. Hence, this part of the curve total CD (i.e. CM) is discarded. From 
FIGURE 9.3 Interpretation of Eq. (9.3.1), for f

D, a horizontal line is drawn to meet 4% drift line at N. So, line ABMDN gives the 
upper bound of h l b b / ratio for different PLs. When no plastic rotation occurs (elastic 
system), θ pb is zero in Eq. (9.3.1), which leads to curve PQ. So, PQ is the lower 
bound of h l b b / ratio.
The hatched zone between the upper bound and lower bound curves gives the 
viable zone of h l b b / ratios. In this viable zone, corresponding higher values of h l b b /
ratio will correspond to a higher plastic rotation. The upper bound line gives plastic 
rotation corresponding to average values of plastic rotation of beams of compliant 
buildings as per ASCE-SEI-41-17. Similar diagrams can be readily constructed for 
other grades of steel (Figures 9.4 and 9.5).

Example 9.3.1 In a building plan the length of beam is 6 m. The building is to be designed 
for (a) IO performance level and 1.2% interstorey drift; (b) LS performance level and 
2.5% interstorey drift; (c) CP performance level with 3.8% drift. Suggest a suitable beam 
size in each case for the building. The yield strength of steel rebar is 500 MPa.

Suggested beam size is 0.4 m × 0.7 m.
9.4 DESIGN STEPS IN UPBD METHOD FOR RC FRAME 
BUILDINGS
With the introduction of specific beam size satisfying target objectives as explained 
in Sections 9.2 and 9.3, there is no need for iteration to arrive at the beam size for 
satisfying target performance objectives. The design steps involved in UPBD method 
for RC frame buildings, including the computation of ESDOF system properties, 
are detailed below. The ESDOF system properties were described by Pettinga and 
Priestley (2005) and originated from the substitute structure concept (Shibata and 
Sozen, 1974).
The steps involved in the UPBD method for the design of RC frame buildings are 
given below.
Step 1: Set the target objectives for the building to be designed. Typical target 
objectives are interstorey drift ( θd ) and member performance level (designated Unified Performance-Based Design of RC Frame Buildings 203
by θ pb). For example, a building may be designed for 2% drift and LS perform￾ance level.
Step 2: Decide the hazard level for which the building is to be designed. It involves 
deciding the design spectrum and its level. For example, a building may be 
designed as per EC-8 design spectrum for type 1 structural condition and ground 
type B, at shaking level 0.6g.
Step 3: Decide material properties namely, characteristic strength of concrete 
( f
ck ) and yield strength of rebar steel ( f
y ).
Step 4: Compute beam depth by Eq. (9.2.4) and by referring to Section 9.3. The 
plastic rotation of the beam is available from FEMA (Table 6-8 of FEMA-356) 
or SEI (Table 10-7 of ASCE-SEI-17), corresponding to the performance level 
desired. The width of the beam is kept from one-third to two-thirds of beam 
depth as per common practice. Take the preliminary sizes of columns from 
experience. One way to maintain the uniformity of buildings is to restrict the 
column steel to a percentage value (generally 3–4%). The column size calcula￾tion also has been discussed in Mayengbam and Choudhury (2014).
Step 5: Take a shape profile from the list as follows:

Step 13: Adopt the load combination and design the building.
The load combinations are:
DL + LL
DL LL Fx + ±
DL LL Fy + ±206 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
where DL is dead load, LL is live load, Fx and Fy are lateral seismic forces (as per 
Eqs. (9.4.16) and (9.4.17)) in short and long directions of the plan of the building, 
respectively.
For design, take the expected strength of materials. From FEMA documents, the 
expected strength of materials are: for concrete 1.5 f
ck and for rebar 1.25 f
y.
Step 14: Evaluation of the designed building.
The building designed has to be checked for its actual performance. The evaluation is 
done through nonlinear static analysis or pushover analysis (POA) and nonlinear time his￾tory analyses (NLTHA). The performance point is obtained from POA. The plastic hinges 
are noted at the end of NLTHA. The relative location of PP and PL (IO, LS, CP) gives the 
actual PL of the building. Drift is obtained from floor displacement time histories. If the 
target design objectives are not achieved, the design may be updated suitably.

Example 9.5.2 A building plan is shown in Figure 9.7. Discuss how you shall apply 
UPBD method for this building. Consider 2.5% drift and LS performance level. Take 
f
y =500 MPa.
Solution: The building can be tackled in the usual way. The point to note is that we 
have to consider the dissimilar beam lengths in any particular direction. We need to 
calculate the yield rotations arising out of each beam length and take the average 
value. The frame yield rotation depends upon beam depth. So, beam depth is first 
found out by taking the highest beam length in a direction. In the UPBD method, you 
get a single beam size in one direction. The steel in each beam will differ based on the 
demand in each beam. This is also the practice for uniform shuttering in construction.
For LS PL, the plastic rotation allowed in beam is 0.02 radian (Table 10-7 of 
ASCE-SEI-41-7). ε y = 500/200000= 0.0025. θd = 0.025.

Example 9.5.3 Carry out the entire procedural steps for UPBD method for a 7-storey 
building with plan shown in Figure 9.7. The interstorey height is 3.3 m, except in 
ground storey where it is 4.2 m. The slab is 120 mm thick. Floor finishing is 1 kN/m2
. 
Exterior infill walls are 1 brick thick (0.25 m) and interior infill walls are half brick 
(0.125 m) thick. LL in floor is 2.5 kN/m2
. Consider 2.5% design drift and LS perform￾ance level. Take fy = 500 MPa. Take the unit weight of RC as 25 kN/m3 and that of 
masonry as 20 kN/m3
. Column size is constant as 500 mm × 500 mm. Use EC-8 spec￾trum for soil type B at 0.35g level.
Solution: In solving the problem, we take help of Example 9.5.2. Plan size is 
20 m × 12 m.
For LS PL, the plastic rotation allowed in beam is 0.02 radian (Table 10-7 of 
ASCE-SEI-41-7). ε y = 500/200000= 0.0025. θd = 0.025.Unified Performance-Based Design of RC Frame Buildings 209
As shown in Example 9.5.2, the short directional beam size is 0.3 m × 0.6 m and 
long directional beam size is 0.35 m × 0.7 m. In the computer model, the weights are 
generally captured by the software from the member sizes and given loadings. Here, 
we shall see how it is computed manually. It may be noted that the seismic weight is 
contributed by the floor mass, a fraction of LL, beams, mass of half of column height 
at top and bottom of floor and mass of half of the infill weight at the top and bottom 
of the floor.
Floor weight
DL due to slab = 0.12 × 25 × 20 × 12 = 720 kN.
DL due to floor finish = 1 × 20 × 12 = 240 kN.
Fraction of LL = 0.25 × 2.5 × 2 0 × 12 = 150 kN. [As LL intensity is less than 
3 kN/m2
.]
The weights of beams, columns and infill are tabulated in Table Ex9.5.3.1.
Total floor weight = 720 + 240 + 150 + 2443 = 3553 kN.
Mass of floor = 3553 × 1000/9.81 kg = 362,181 kg.
Mass of the first floor will be slightly more than this due to extra height of column. 
But this part has been ignored here. Weight of roof = 720 + 2443/2 = 1941.5 kN. So, 
the roof mass is 197,910 kg.
The steps as in Section 9.4 are followed.
Step 1: Target objectives: θd = 2.5%, PL is LS ( θ pb = 0.02 radian).
Step 2: Hazard level: Demand spectrum of EC-8 spectrum for soil type B at 0.45g 
level is considered.
Step 3: Material: Yield strength of rebar f
y
 = 500 MPa. The strength of the concrete 
will not be required for the question.
Step 4: Compute beam depth: The beam sizes have been computed above 
and these are: 0.3 m × 0.6 m in the short direction and 0.35 m × 0.7 m in 
the long direction.

Solution: Plan size is 26 m × 16.5 m (429 m2

As per the discussion in Section 4.11, plastic rotation for primary members

Floor weight
DL intensity in slab = 0.125 × 25 + 2 (including finish) = 5.125 kN/m2

Floor DL = 5.125 × 429 = 2199 kN.
Fraction of LL intensity in floor = 0.25 × 2.5 =0.625 kN/m2
. [As LL intensity is 
within 3 kN/m2
, 25% LL contributes to seismic load.]
LL weight on floor = 0.625 × 429 = 268 kN.
Total seismic weight in each floor = 2199 + 268 = 2467 kN.
Considering roof treatment weight in roof as 2 kN/m2
, roof load = 2199 kN.
The weights of beams, columns and infill are tabulated in Table Ex9.5.4.1.
Total floor weight in each floor = 2467 + 3648 = 6115 kN.
Mass of floor = 6115 × 1000/9.81 kg = 623,343 kg.

9.5.1  Modelling Example
The building is modelled in SAP2000 (CSI Inc.) software. The analysis is done along 
both long and short directions. The pushover curves are shown in Figure 9.13 in the 
short direction and in Figure 9.14 along the long direction. The performance point 
in both the curves lies beyond IO and within LS PL. This indicates that the building 
satisfies LS PL, which is the target PL.
Inter-storey drift diagram (IDR)
For drawing IDR diagram, NLTHA are to be carried out under SCGMs. In Figure 9.15, 
a typical drift diagram for a ground motion in short direction of the building is shown. 
As per FEMA-356, five ground motions may be taken when the highest value of 
output parameter is to be reported. If ten or more earthquakes are taken, the average 
value output parameter may be reported. As per ASCE-SEI-17 minimum of 11 ground 
motions to be used for evaluation purpose and the average value is to be reported. It 
is found that the achieved drift is within the target value, hence, satisfactory. The drift 
diagram in the long direction is not shown here.

9.7 CRITICAL CASES
In some cases, the given drift may be less than the plastic rotation corresponding to 
the design PL. In such cases, the Eq. (9.2.4) does not work. However, the case is not 
impractical altogether. We discuss this aspect below.
Let us consider the equation for yield rotation of frame:
θ
ε
yF
y b
b
l
h = 0 5.
A graph can be drawn between l
b
/hb
 ratio and θyF for various grades of steel 
(Figure 9.17). The beam depth is generally restricted to 1/10th to 1/12th of beam 
length. Here, the plot has been shown for l
b
/hb
 ratio up to 17.
FIGURE 9.15 IDR diagram for Example 9.5.4 (for short direction).222 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
On the same figure, we show the limits of average plastic rotations for IO, LS and 
CP as horizontal lines. If we take f
y
 as 415 MPa and l
b
/hb
 ratio at point A, then AB 
is the amount of yield rotation. If we design for LS performance level, the plastic 
rotation allowable is AC. Total rotation allowable is AB + AC. In the figure AB +
FIGURE 9.17 Interpretation of yield rotation and plastic rotation.
FIGURE 9.16 Displacement ductility vs. effective damping.Unified Performance-Based Design of RC Frame Buildings 223
AC = 0.01 + 0.02 = 0.03 radian (= AD). So, for this combination of l
b
/hb
 ratio and steel 
grade, a system can be designed for 3% drift and LS PL.
Now, take up the case when θd = θpb is negative. Here, θd
 is less than θpb. It indicates 
that we are below the horizontal line corresponding to the PL considered. P is such a 
point for LS PL and Fe415 steel. So, here, AP is total rotation (θd
) AB is yield rotation 
and BP is plastic rotation. Here, the members of the structure will not reach the last 
limit of LS performance level, but the PL designator for the structure is still LS, as 
point P is above IO line and below LS line.
9.8 GENERATION OF DISPLACEMENT SPECTRA
This topic was discussed in Chapter 3. Here it is further explained with examples.
Typically, the design codes give the acceleration response spectrum as the design 
spectrum. For displacement-based design, one needs to convert the acceleration 
spectra to displacement spectra. The basic equation for the conversion is given as Eq. 
(9.8.1).
S S a d = ω2 (9.8.1)
where Sa is spectral acceleration, ω is natural frequency of SDOF system and Sd
is spectral displacement.
Noting that ω
π = 2
T (T is time period of vibration of SDOF system). Eq. (9.8.1) 
can be written as Eq. (9.8.2).

The design spectrum is given in terms of time period along the x-axis vs. Sa /g ratio

vertical axis will indicate spectral displacement.
The design spectrum is given at 5% damping at elastic condition. The displace￾ment spectra for other damping may be found from Eq. (9.8.4), available in literature.

Figures 9.18 and 9.19, respectively.
9.9 CLOSURE
The UPBD method for RC frame buildings has been presented in this chapter. The 
theoretical background of the method was discussed. The interpretation of the basic 
equation was elaborated. The step-wise procedure for design was described. Design 
examples were provided to discuss various aspects.
The advantage of UPBD method is that it be can used to design the building for 
target drift and target PL. It also gives the member size at the beginning, so that the 
FIGURE 9.18 Displacement spectra corresponding to IS 1893 for medium soil at MCE 
(0.36g level).Unified Performance-Based Design of RC Frame Buildings 225
iteration for member size is not required. The method has been found to give con￾sistent results. Experience showed that in all cases the performance level is achieved. 
In some cases, drift may be a little away from the target value. This happens due to 
the effect of column on drift. A variation of achieved drift to within ± 20% of target 
value may be considered satisfactory.

Unified Performance￾Based Design of RC 
Dual System
10.1 INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 8, we studied the DDBD method for the dual system. As was stated in that 
chapter, a dual system consists of frame elements and shear walls. Shear wall is a 
planar element in the building, which takes the lateral shear arising out of earthquake 
or wind, in its own plane. We have also studied the frame–shear wall interaction. In 
this chapter, we shall establish the UPBD method for the design of RC dual system. 
The term unified performance-based design (UPBD) was first coined by Choudhury 
(2007). The UPBD method for RC frame buildings has been already introduced 
in Chapter 9. The UPBD method for frame–shear wall buildings was developed 
by Choudhury (2007). It is an extension of the DDBD methodology developed by 
Sullivan et al. (2006). In the DDBD method developed by Sullivan et al. (2006a, 
2006b), only drift was taken as the target design criterion. In the UPBD method, both 
drift and performance levels are incorporated in the design philosophy. Apart from 
satisfying drift and PL, the UPBD method also gives the size of the wall in the begin￾ning of the design, thus avoiding iteration. The sizes of beams are determined as per 
by Choudhury and Singh (2013), as discussed in Chapter 9. The size of columns can 
be found out from Mayengbam and Choudhury (2014).
The primary design target objectives for RC frame–shear wall buildings are: 
(i) interstorey drift θd ( ) and (ii) member performance level. The member perform￾ance level is designated in terms of plastic rotation in the members. As per capacity 
design (see Chapter 6) and the principle of weak-beam strong-column for buildings, 
the columns do not undergo inelastic deformation. It is the beam that has to form 
plastic hinges and dissipate energy. Shear wall is a cantilever deep beam. The lion’s 
share of the hysteretic energy in a dual system is dissipated through the shear wall. 
This is because of the enormous length of the wall. Thus, the member performance 
level for RC frame–shear wall buildings can be expressed in terms of the plastic rota￾tion of the shear wall. In the following section, it is shown how both these parameters, 
namely, drift and performance level, can be incorporated in the design philosophy 
as the target design objectives. We shall also see how the member sizes are also 
conceptualized by theoretical formulation.
10Unified Performance-Based Design of RC Dual System 229
For designating a structure corresponding to an accepted damage state (point P 
in Figure 10.1(a), effective stiffness (ke
) (also called secant stiffness) is to be used. 
The  target displacement (also called design displacement) that corresponds to the 
damage level is ∆d . The time period of the structure is initially T (elastic time period), 
but this keeps changing as the structure reaches the nonlinear state. The time period 
corresponding to any point on the nonlinear part of the force–deformation curve is 
designated as the effective time period (Te
). The time period relationship in general is 
given by Eq. (10.1.1), in which me is effective mass of the equivalent single degree of 
freedom (ESDOF) system.

10.2 THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT OF UPBD METHOD 
FOR THE DUAL SYSTEM
A 3D dual system was shown in Figure 8.1 in Chapter 8. Consider the 2D dual system 
building in Figure 10.2(a). From structural dynamics theory, it is possible to convert 
the 2D/3D building to an equivalent single degree of freedom (ESDOF) system, as 
has been discussed in earlier chapters. The ESDOF system has an equivalent single 
mass (me
) and equivalent height (He
). The equivalent height corresponds to an equiva￾lent overturning moment replicating the overturning moment of the real building. The 
ESDOF system undergoes a displacement compatible to and in tune with the dis￾placement pattern of the real building.
FIGURE 10.1 (a) Force–deformation curve and (b) displacement spectra.230 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
The displacement pattern of a real building depends upon its shape profile. The shape 
profile of a dual system is given by the yield displacement of the wall at different 
floor levels.
We use the following symbols:
θd = target design drift
θ yW = maximum elastic rotation of wall
θ pW = plastic rotation of wall
me = effective mass of ESDOF system
He = effective height of ESDOF system
LW = horizontal length of wall
hinf = height of inflection for wall
φ yW = yield curvature of wall
∆yW = yield displacement of wall = θ yW He
ε y = yield strain of rebar
The total angular displacement of the ESDOF system is the summation of the elastic 
angular displacement and plastic angular displacement. The total angular displace￾ment of the ESDOF system is the angular design drift (θd
). Though the frame and 
wall are integrally built, the deformation of the wall is predominant in a dual system. 
Design drift means the interstorey drift value for which the building is designed. 
The design drift is the summation of the maximum elastic drift of the wall (θYW) and 
plastic rotation of the wall (θpW). The above concept is in reference to Figure 10.2(b) 
and can be expressed as
θ θ θ d yW pW = + (10.2.1)
FIGURE 10.2 (a) MDOF dual system, (b) equivalent SDOF system and (c) force–
displacement response.Unified Performance-Based Design of RC Dual System 231
The yield rotation of wall is given by Eq. (10.2.2) (Priestley 2003):

Eq. (10.2.4) gives the length of the wall that satisfies the given drift and performance 
level (quantified by the plastic rotation of wall). Depending on the target PL, the 
corresponding plastic rotation of the wall (available in FEMA documents and SEI-41) 
can be fed into the equation.
10.2.1  Thickness of the Wall
Based on the plan arrangement, we can select the number of walls in any particular 
direction of the plan of the building. In a dual system, shear wall takes a major part 
of the design base shear. However, the frame is designed to take about 25–40% of the 
base shear. Let Vt
 denote the total design base shear (which we shall calculate soon), 
VW denote the base shear taken by the wall and VF denotes the base shear taken by the 
frame system. We can write Eq. (10.2.5) as follows:
V V V t W F = + (10.2.5a)
V V V W t F = − (10.2.5b)232 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
If there are NW is the number of walls in a particular direction of the plan and t
W is 
the thickness of each wall, then shear stress in a wall is given by
τ = V N
L t

(10.2.6a)
Some codes (like, IS 1893 2016) suggest that 80% of the length of the wall is effective 
in taking shear. So, Eq. (10.2.6a) is modified to Eq. (10.2.6b):
τ = V N

E. (10.2.6c) gives the safe value of t

In actual design, a part of wall shear will be carried by concrete and the balance 
shear by horizontal shear steel. Accordingly, the horizontal steel is obtained.
10.3 INTERPRETATION OF THE EQUATION: EQ. (10.2.4)
We can rewrite Eq. (10.2.4) as Eq. (10.3.1):

θ θ (10.3.1)
As discussed in Chapter 9, to plot Eq. (10.3.1), we need to decide the range of drift 
that corresponds to a performance level. Referring to Table C1-3 of FEMA-356, the 
drift for vertical members corresponding to different PLs are: IO: 1% transient drift 
with negligible permanent drift, LS: 2% transient drift with 1% permanent drift and, 
CP: 4% transient or permanent drift. The permanent drift implies plastic rotation. As 
per these guidelines, we shall assume the following ranges of drifts for different PLs:
IO: 1–1.5% drift
LS: 1.5–3% drift
CP: 3–4% drift.Unified Performance-Based Design of RC Dual System 233
Drift less than 1% may be assumed as too stringent for practical design purposes. 
For any given PL, the maximum allowable value of θpW remains constant. For a given 
grade of steel, ey is known and is fixed. So, a graph can be drawn between LW/hinf ratio 
and θd by varying θd
. Let us take Fe415 steel (f
y
 = 415 MPa) and IO performance level. 
Here, ey = 415/2 × 105
 = 0.002075. The average plastic rotation for RC walls for IO 
level as per ASCE-SEI-41-17 (Table 10-19 of this document) for compliant buildings 
is 0.003375 radian. So, Eq. (10.3.1) takes the form (10.3.1a):
L
h
W
inf d
= −
0 002075
0 003375
.
θ . (10.3.1a)
The graph of corresponding to Eq. (10.3.1.a) is the curve AB as shown in Figure 10.3. 
So, AB corresponds to the IO performance level. The average plastic rotation of wall 
for compliant buildings for LS PL is 0.00975 radian. Putting this in Eq. (10.3.1), 
curve CD is obtained, which corresponds to LS performance level. Similarly, curve 
EF corresponds to CP performance level (plastic rotation of wall is 0.01425 radian). 
From the end of IO performance horizontal line, BM is drawn. Now, for part CM of 
LS performance, the same LW/hinf can give IO performance as well. Hence, this part of 
curve CD is discarded. From point D, horizontal line is drawn to meet 4% drift line at 
N. So, line ABMDN gives the upper bound of LW/hinf ratio for different performances. 
When no plastic rotation occurs (elastic system), θpW is zero in Eq. (10.3.1), which 
leads to curve PQ. So, PQ is lower bounds of LW/hinf ratio.
The hatched zone between the upper bound and lower bound curves give the viable 
zone of LW/hinf ratios. In the viable zone, the corresponding higher values of LW/hinf ratio 
will give more plastic rotation. The upper bound line gives plastic rotation corresponding 
to average values of compliant building walls as per ASCE-SEI-41-17. Similar diagrams 
can be readily constructed for other grades of steel (Figures 10.4 and 10.5).

Example 10.3.1: In a dual system building plan the length of beam is 6 m. The 
building is to be designed for (a) IO performance level and 1.3% interstorey drift, 
(b) LS performance level and 2.8% interstorey drift and (c) CP performance level 
with 3.6% drift. Suggest suitable wall length in each case for the building. The grade 
of steel is Fe500. Take height of inflection as 20 m.
Solution: The yield strain for Fe500 grade steel = 500/2 × 105

10.4 DESIGN STEPS IN UPBD METHOD FOR RC DUAL SYSTEM 
BUILDINGS
The design steps involved in UPBD method for RC dual system buildings, including 
the computation of ESDOF system properties, are detailed below.
Step 1: Set the target objectives for the building to be designed. The typical target 
objectives are interstorey drift (θd ) and member performance level (designated 
by θ pb for beam and θ pW for wall).236 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
Step 2: Decide the hazard level for which the building is to be designed. It involves 
deciding the design spectrum and its level. For example, a building may be 
designed as per EC-8 design spectrum for type 1 structural condition and ground 
type B, at shaking level 0.6g. As dual system is taller than normal buildings, a 
higher level of seismicity may be needed to meet the displacement demand.
Step 3: Decide material properties namely characteristic strength of concrete ( f
ck ) 
and yield strength of rebar steel ( f
y ). The concrete strength will be required 
when you model it in the computer.
Step 4: Compute length of wall from Eq. (10.2.4) and Section 10.3.
Step 5: Compute beam depth as discussed in Chapter 9.
Step 6: Compute the inflection height of wall.
See Chapter 8 for this computation. This gives relative overturning moment 
in frame MOTF , and wall base moment MW .
The following expressions are helpful in preparing the table for inflection 
height.

M M V h h Wi W i W i i i = + ( − ) , +1 , +1 +1 (8.4.2)
Step 7: Compute shape profile
The displacement profile of the wall is obtained from the yield displace￾ment of walls in different floors as expressed by Eqs. (10.4.1 to 10.4.2). 
The final deflections at floor levels is given by Eq. (10.4.3).

case in UPBD method, the average value of µ F i, can be taken as µ F .
Step 11: Compute wall ductility
Wall ductility (µ W ) is given by Eq. (10.4.9), in which Lp is the lower 
value out of Eqs. (10.4.10a and 10.4.10b).238 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures

In Eq. (10.4.10a) f

Step 12: Compute system ductility trial effective time period

Step 16: Apply load combination and design the building.
The load combinations are:
DL + LL
DL LL Fx + ±
DL LL Fy + ±
where DL is dead load, LL is live load, Fx and Fy are lateral seismic 
forces (as per Eqs. (10.4.18)) in the short and the long directions of the 
plan of the building, respectively.
For design, take the expected strength of materials. From FEMA 
documents, the expected strength of concrete is 1.5 f
ck and that of steel 
is 1.25 f
y .
Step 17: Evaluation of the designed building
The building designed has to be checked for its actual performance. The 
evaluation is done through nonlinear static analysis (POA) and nonlinear 
dynamic analyses (NLTHA). The performance point is obtained from 
POA. The plastic hinges are noted at the end of NLTHA. This along with 
PP will give PL of the building. Drift is obtained from floor displacement 
time histories. If the target design objectives are not achieved, design may 
be updated suitably.240 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
10.5 DESIGN EXAMPLES
Example 10.5.1 A 15-storey dual system building plan is 30 m × 18 m in size. The 
design drift is 2.5% and target performance level is LS. The floor thickness is 120 mm, 
superimposed DL in floor is 1 kN/m2 in floor. Exterior infill walls are 250 mm thick 
and interior walls are 125 mm thick. Column size is 600 mm × 600 m all through. 
Find the lateral seismic design forces. Take fy
 as 500 MPa for rebar, and concrete 
strength as 30 MPa. Use EC-8 spectrum for soil type B at 0.55g level. Interstorey 
height is 3.4 m and ground storey height is 4.4 m. Consider 20% opening in infill 
walls. Assume that frame carries 30% of base shear. The diameter of the longitudinal 
bar in wall is 20 mm.
Solution:
Initial computations:
The design drift θd = 0.025 radian. The yield strain rebar steel is 500/2 × 105
 =
0.0025. The average plastic rotation allowable for LS performance level for com￾pliant buildings (ASCE-SEI-41-17) is 0.02 radian for beams and 0.00975 radian for 
walls. Building height is 52 m. Using Eq. (10.6.1) hinf = − (1 0.3 5 ) × 2 = 36.4 m.

The floor weights are tabulated in Table Ex10.5.1.1. Column height = 3.4 – 0.8 = 2.6 m.

Roof weight: Slab and beam weights are same as that in floor. Half load of column, 
wall and infill will be added. Superimposed DL will not be added. Roof weight =
864 + 960 + 1620 + 0.5(374 +140 + 140 + 1018 + 700) kN = 4630 kN. Roof

Compute inflection height of the wall
Table Ex10.2 is prepared.
From the Table by interpolation, or from Figure 10.7 hinf = 35.7 m. Remember 
that we used this value as 36.4 m. The difference is not high. L h W inf / = 6/35.7 = 0.16. 
Figure 10.4 shows that this value is within the upper and lower bound curves; hence, 
admissible. The table gives MOTF = 35.294 kN-m (relative value) and MW = 19.694 
kN-m (relative value).

respectively. The rebar diameter of vertical steel in wall is 20 mm.
Solution:
Initial computations:
Number of storeys, N = 20, H = 19 × 3.3 + 4.3 = 67 m. Design drift θd = 0.026. 
The yield strain rebar steel is 500/2 × 105
 = 0.0025. The average plastic rotation 
allowable for LS performance level for compliant buildings (ASCE-SEI-41-17) is 
0.02 radian for beams and, 0.00975 radian for walls. 27% of base shear is to carried 
by the frame. Using Eq. (10.6.1),
hinf = − (1 vf ) H = (1 – 0.27) × 67 = 48.91 m (preliminary assessment).

From Figure 10.13, Te = 4.51 s. This differs from Te t, rial (7.37 s). So, put 4.51 sec

New values of parameters with this time period is given below.

Distribution of the base shear over the floors (long direction)
Table Ex10.5.2.7 is prepared by using Eq. (10.4.18).
10.6 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN hinf AND H
The inflection height of wall does not depend on wall size (length and thickness). 
It depends on height of building, interstorey height and, may be slightly on floor 
masses. So, it should be possible to find an empirical relationship between total 
height of building and inflection height. Computer program was written in C++ and 
the variation of inflection height was studied by varying heights and other parameters. 
By analysing the large number of building data, an empirical relationship has been 
established as given in Eq. (10.6.1).
hinf = − (1 vf ) H (10.6.1)
where vf is the fraction of shear taken by frame (in ratio) and H is total height of 
the building.

Verification of the empirical formula Eq. (10.6.1)
The verification is done here by utilizing the results obtained in various dual system 
buildings in Chapter 9 and 10. Table 10.6.1 is prepared by utilizing the data. It is 
observed that the expression (10.6.1) works well.
10.7 EFFECT OF LENGTH OF THE WALL
First, the yield curvature of wall is related to its length. Using Eq. (10.4.4), Figure 10.15
is obtained, which shows the variation of yield curvature (φ yW) with wall length and 
yield strength of steel. The figure shows that yield curvature value is high at small 
wall length and yield curvature value is low at large wall length. From Sullivan et al. 
(2006), the ultimate curvature of wall is given by Eq. (10.7.1).

FIGURE 10.16 Variation of ultimate curvature of wall with length of wall.
Ultimate curvature is independent of grade of steel. The variation of ultimate curva￾ture of wall with its length is shown in Figure 10.16. The pattern of variation is similar 
to yield curvature. The curvature ductility (µφW ) is given by Eq. (10.7.2). Eq. (10.7.2) 
shows that the curvature ductility of wall depends only on the grade of steel.

(10.7.3)
Eqs. (10.7.2) and (10.7.3) show that maximum curvature ductility of wall depends 
only on the grade of steel.
For studying the variation of parameters like µ F, µ W , µ ξ sys F , ξ W , ξsys , ∆d , me , ke , 
Vb , a 10-storey frame-wall building of height 36 m is considered. The wall length is 
varied from 3 to 20 m. The percentage shear carried by frame is taken as 35%. Beam 
length is taken as 5 m and beam depth is 0.9 m. EC-8 spectra for soil type at 0.45g 
level was considered. The floor mass is taken as 800 kN-s2
/m and the roof mass is 
taken as 700 kN-s2
/m.
From analysis of the data, Figure 10.17 is drawn. It is found that the wall ductility 
always  increases with wall length. The frame ductility is more or less constant 
because no variation in frame parameters was involved in the study. The system 
ductility also increases with wall length, but the increase is much lower than wall 262 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
ductility. The damping of wall reduces with wall length. The system damping does 
not vary much with wall length. The design displacement (not shown in the figure) 
was found to vary from 0.54 to 0.61 m.
Figure 10.18 shows that the variation of Vb , ke and me with wall length is negligible.
10.8 EFFECT OF HEIGHT OF THE BUILDING
Example 10.8.1 To study the effect of height of buildings on various design 
parameters, we vary the building height keeping wall length, beam size and column 
size constant. This is a bit hypothetical, because the wall length will increase with 
height of the building. We actually increase the number of storeys of the building. To 
judge approximately the effect of height of building, we consider storey height as 3.4 
m, ground storey height as 4.4 m, floor mass as 800 kN-s2
/m, roof mass as 700 kN-s2
/
FIGURE 10.18 Effect of wall length on k m V e e b , and .
FIGURE 10.17 Effect of wall length on various ESDOF system parameters.Unified Performance-Based Design of RC Dual System 263
m, length of wall as 8 m, length of beam as 5m, depth of beam as 0.9 m, diameter of 
bar as 20 mm, yield strength of rebar as 500 MPa, post yield stiffness ratio as 01 and 
frame carries 30% of base shear. As the displacement demand increases with height, 
we consider EC-8 spectrum for soil type B at seismicity level 0.8g. We calculate all 
system properties and plot them.
Figure 10.19 shows that the wall ductility falls with building height when wall 
length is kept constant. The frame ductility is almost invariant. The system ductility 
decreases with building height. The damping in wall, frame and system are almost 
identical in magnitude and their variation with building height is negligible.
Figure 10.20 shows that the effective stiffness falls with building height when 
wall length is kept constant. This is natural as taller the building is, more flexible it 
becomes. The design base shear is almost invariant with height. The effective mass 
FIGURE 10.20 Variation of ke , Vb and me with building height.
FIGURE 10.19 Variation of design parameters with building height.264 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
slightly increases with height of the building because the total mass increases with 
increase of building height (number of storeys).
It is interesting to see that the design displacement and effective time period 
increases linearly with height of the building (Figure 10.21), and it possible to get 
equations of such straight lines.
10.9 EFFECT OF VARIATION OF PERCENTAGE BASE SHEAR 
CARRIED BY FRAME
The common practice is to allow 25–40% of base shear to be carried by the frame, 
and the remaining part of base shear is carried by the wall. For studying the effect of 
such variation of base shear carried by frame, we take up an example here.
Example 10.9.1 Take a 15-storey frame-wall building. Wall length is 10 m, beam is 
450 mm × 900 mm in size and 6 m in length, column size is constant, diameter of 
rebar is 25 mm, yield strength of rebar is 500 MPa, storey height is 3.3 m, ground 
storey height is 4.4 m, floor mass as 800 kN-s2
/m, roof mass as 700 kN-s2
/m, post yield 
stiffness ratio is 01, design drift 2%. EC-8 spectrum for soil type B at seismicity level 
0.6g is taken. Vary the percentage frame shear from 25% to 45% @ 2% increment. 
Calculate all system properties and plot them.
Figure 10.22 shows the variation of ductility and damping with percent frame 
shear. It is found that the wall ductility increases with percent frame shear. This 
is due to the reason that, as frame shear increases the wall shear decreases. This 
raises the height of inflection, which is a parameter in wall ductility. Figure 10.22
shows that the frame ductility and system ductility are insensitive to variation of 
frame shear.
Figure 10.23 shows the variation of effective stiffness, effective mass and base 
shear percent frame shear. It is found that the effective stiffness slightly decreases 
FIGURE 10.21 Variation with building height: (a) design displacement and (b) effective time 
period.Unified Performance-Based Design of RC Dual System 265
with percent frame shear. The effective mass and base shear are insensitive to the vari￾ation of percent frame shear. Figure 10.24(a) shows that effective time period slightly 
increases with percent frame shear, while Figure 10.24(b) shows that the design dis￾placement increases with percent frame shear.
10.10 CRITICAL CASES
In some cases, the given design drift may be less than the plastic rotation corresponding 
to the target PL. In such cases, the Eq. (10.2.4) does not work. However, the case is 
not an impractical one altogether. We discuss this aspect below.
FIGURE 10.23 Variation of effective stiffness and mass, and base shear with frame shear.

On the same figure, we show the limits of average plastic rotations for IO, LS and 
CP as horizontal lines. If we take f
y
 as 415 MPa and hinf/LW ratio as 8 (point A), then 
AC is the amount of yield rotation. If we design for LS performance level, the plastic 
rotation allowable is AB. Total rotation allowable is AB + AC. In the figure AB +
AC = 0.00975 +0.0166 = 0.0264 radian (= AD). So, for this combination of hinf/LW 
ratio and steel, a system can be designed.
Now, take up the case when θ θ d pW − is negative. Here, θd is less than θ pW

indicates we are below the horizontal line corresponding to the PL considered. P is

such a point for LS PL and Fe415 steel. In such a case the shear wall will remain 
elastic. If h L inf W / is lower (say 4, or less), the scenario will be different.
10.11 CLOSURE
The UPBD method for frame–shear wall buildings has been presented in this chapter. 
The theoretical background of the method was discussed. The interpretation of the 
basic equation was done. The step-wise procedure for design was described. Design 
examples have been given to discuss various aspects. An empirical expression has 
been given for inflection height of the wall. The variation of different parameters 
involved, with length of wall and, height of building, was discussed.
The advantage of UPBD method is that it can be used to design the building for 
both target drift and target PL. It also gives the wall size and beam size at the begin￾ning, so that iteration for size is not required. The method has been found to give 
consistent results.
Readers are to note that only computation of floor forces arising out of seismic 
action have been computed here. The implementation in the computer model 
requires more work. The shear wall can be modelled as wide column or layered 
shell element. The analysis and design are to be done with the expected strength. 
The nonlinear analyses are to be carried out with reduced stiffness as per actual 
strength. This will need patience and time. Capacity design is to be carried out so 
that columns do not yield. Adequate ground motions (generally spectrum compat￾ible ground motions) are to be used for dynamic analysis. The achieved drift and 
performance levels are to be compared with those of the target values. The achieved 
performance level should never exceed the target value. Achieved drift may lie 
within ± 20% of target value.

UPBD for Steel Frame 
Buildings
11.1 INTRODUCTION
We are now familiar with the UPBD method of design. We have applied this method 
to the design of RC frame buildings in Chapter 9 and to RC frame–wall buildings in 
Chapter 10. In this chapter, we apply this method to steel frame buildings. The add￾itional intricacy in applying the UPBD method to steel buildings arises out of the 
fact that the plastic rotation for a performance level of the system is not available as 
a numerical value. It depends on the yield rotation, which in turn depends on many 
parameters, including geometry of the section. Unless a section is chosen, the yield 
rotation cannot be obtained. And the chosen section may not satisfy the requirement, 
thus needing many iterations.
11.2 DEVELOPMENT OF UPBD METHOD FOR STEEL BUILDINGS
A multiple degree of freedom (MDOF) system can be converted to an equivalent 
single degree of freedom (ESDOF) system by utilizing available dynamical equations. 
Figure 11.1 explains this. The properties of an ESDOF system are given below.
Effective mass (me )
Equivalent height (He )
Equivalent damping (ξe )
Design displacement (∆d ).
Let the target design drift be θd and target design plastic rotation corresponding to the 
desired performance level be θ p
. In the UPBD method, we wish to design for these 
two target design criteria.
Figure 11.2(a) shows an MDOF system that can be converted to an ESDOF system 
as shown in Figure 11.2.1(b). The total rotation that the ESDOF system undergoes 
is equal to the target angular design drift (θd ). The total angular rotation is the sum 
of elastic rotation (θe ) and plastic rotation (θ p). So, we can write Equation (11.2.1) 
describing this relationship.

θ θ θ d e p = + (11.2.1)
The maximum elastic rotation of ESDOF system (θe
) is equal to the yield rotation of 
the 3D steel frame (θ yF ). Priestley et al. (2007) gave the expression for yield rotation 
of structural steel frame as Eq. (11.2.2).

b = length of the beam in the direction of seismic load under consideration
hb = depth of the beam in the direction of seismic load under consideration.
In a steel frame building, we apply capacity design in the form of weak-beam strong￾column concept. This implies that the beams will attain a plastic state while columns 
will remain elastic. So, the entire plastic rotation of the system arises out of the beam 
alone. In Eq. (11.2.1), we can write θ θ p pb = , where θ pb is the plastic rotation in the 
beams. Now we can rewrite Eq. (11.2.1) as Eq. (11.2.3).
θ θ θ d yF pb = + (11.2.3)
Combining Eq. (11.2.3) and Eq. (11.2.2), we get Eq. (11.2.4).

Eq. (11.2.4) gives a beam depth that satisfies both drift and PL in terms of plastic 
rotation. This beam depth is obtained at the start of the design. Hence, iteration 
is not necessary for determining beam depth. The designer is required to match 
from the available standard sections of structural steel the one that matches nearly 
to this depth.
11.3 PLASTIC ROTATION OF STEEL BEAMS
Unlike that in RC beams, the plastic rotations for steel beams are not available dir￾ectly in tabular numerical values for any PL. It is available in terms of chord rotation 
of beam (θy
) (see Figure 11.2). Such values are available in FEMA-356 (2000) as well 
as in ASCE-SEI-41-13 (2013), as shown in Table 11.1. The ASCE-SEI-41-17 (2017)
seems to have some typological error in this provision.
Table 11.1 gives the plastic rotations corresponding to IO, LS and CP in terms of 
chord yield rotation (θy
). The yield rotation of chord (θy
) in Table 11.1 is given by 
Eq. (11.3.1) and is explained in Figure 11.2. The chord yield rotation is a function 
of beam length, beam moment of inertia about the transverse axis and material prop￾erties. Now it is clear to the readers that until a section is chosen, the value of θy and 
hence plastic rotations at different PLs cannot be found out.

11.4 METHODOLOGY
The lumped floor masses (mi
) are supposed to be known in the beginning. Shape 
profiles are obtained from available equations (Priestley and Calvi, 1997). The critical 
storey is that storey where the mass is largest or, the inter-storey height of storey is 
largest. Displacement profiles are now obtained from which the ESDOF system prop￾erties are computed. System ductility is obtained from yield displacement and target 
displacement. From system ductility system, damping is computed, which enables 
one to compute the base shear utilizing the displacement spectra. Beam section is 
selected by computing beam depth from Eq. (11.2.4). In doing so, the chord rotation 
angle is to be utilized. The chord rotation angle again depends on the section proper￾ties. So, selecting a beam section for a particular target design criteria requires some 
search in the steel table. The process has been explained with a numerical example 
in Section 11.5.
The design steps are given below.
Step 1: Decide target design criteria, namely, drift and PL; decide the 
hazard level.
Step 2: Compute the beam depth from Eq. (11.2.4) and select a beam section (see 
numerical example in Section 11.6).
Step 3: Compute the shape profile from Eqs. (11.5.1) and (11.5.2).

11.5 NUMERICAL EXAMPLES ON THE SELECTION OF BEAM 
SECTION
We are taking here the structural steel section conforming to Indian Standard. The 
principle is general and is not restricted to code of any country.
Example 11.6.1 Arrive at a beam section to accommodate a design drift of 2% and 
PL LS. The beam length is 3 m.
Solution: Prepare an Excel sheet with all available steel sections for beam (I-sections) 
in increasing order of depth. In Table 11.2, only one part of such Excel sheet is shown, 
where solution was obtained at the condition ( ~ h h ) b . Table 11.1 is used to get value 
of θ pb (FEMA-356). For LS PL, θ θ pb y = 2 . When h and hb are found to be approxi￾mately equal, one can stop and select that beam section.
From Table 11.2, beam section ISMB400 is adopted (out of some more viable 
sections).
11.6 CLOSURE
The UPBD method for steel frame buildings is more round about than that of RC 
frame buildings. Search is required in the available beam sections. It is also possible 
that in some cases solution may not come. So, a personal judgement is also warranted.
A shape profile for steel frame building was proposed by Kotapaty as given by Eq.

Effect of Infill
12.1 INTRODUCTION
In this chapter, the effect of infill on buildings and modelling of the infill are discussed. 
Infill is a nonstructural component, as it is not designed to carry any force. In this 
chapter, infill refers to masonry infills. Infill walls are provided in RC buildings and 
steel buildings to serve the following purposes:
(i) It protects the dwellers from sun, wind, rain, frost, etc.
(ii) It protects the dwellers from theft and burglary.
(iii) It protects the dwellers from heat wave and cold wave.
(iv) It gives privacy to the dwellers.
(v) It allows partitioning of space.
Masonry infill consists of bricks and mortar joining the bricks in a specified pattern 
(bonding). Both bricks and mortar are weak in tension but good against compressive 
forces. Under tensile force, the brick masonry cracks, generally along the mortar 
joints. During shaking from earthquake, the frame sways and causes bounded infill 
panel to experience compression along one diagonal and tension along the other. The 
tension and compression along the two diagonals toggle during reversible shaking. 
Separation or tearing may take place along the tension diagonal. But the compression 
diagonal will take a large compressive force before failure. This sets a strut action 
along the compression diagonal. The strut action increases the stiffness of the system. 
In fact, a large additional stiffness is set into the building from infills. It may be 
mentioned that masonry is a brittle material with very limited ductility.
The normal design of the buildings considers the weight of infill but ignores its 
stiffness. This leads to an unrealistic assessment of the structural behaviour and 
hence, leads to improper design.
12.2 STRUT ACTION AND STRUT MODEL OF MASONRY
A typical masonry infill panel is shown in Figure 12.1. Figure 12.2 shows the same 
panel  when subjected to frame sway. Various strut models are available for unre￾inforced masonry (Figure 12.3). The strut model is an equivalent strut that can offer 
12Effect of Infill 281
same stiffness as that of real masonry panel. The thickness of the strut is same as that 
of the masonry. The width of the strut is given by empirical formula (Eq. 12.2.1). The 
modulus of elasticity of the strut material is same as that of the masonry. In the com￾puter, strut is modelled as a brace element (axially loaded element) with thickness as 
that of masonry and width as given by Eq. (12.2.1). The expected strength of masonry 
is taken as 1.3 times the nominal strength.
FEMA-356 gives Eq. (12.2.1) for equivalent width of the strut.

12.2.1  Infill Strut Modelling
The infill is modelled as an axially loaded pin-connected member. The connection 
may be placed in a concentric way as shown in Figure 12.3(a), in which case the forces 
from the infill panel acts at the corner joint. The strut may be placed eccentrically as 
FIGURE 12.3 Infill strut modelling: (a) concentric placement, (b) eccentric placement and 
(c) with opening.
FIGURE 12.2 Masonry infill panel under frame sway.Effect of Infill 283
shown in Figure 12.3(b), in which case the strut force is transferred to the columns 
only. In many practical cases, there shall be openings in the infill wall. The strut 
model in such a case is shown in Figure 12.3(c).
12.3 MASONRY STRENGTH
The strength of masonry depends on the strength of bricks and strength of the mortar 
that binds the bricks. The compressive strength of masonry is given by Eq. (12.3.1).
σ σ σ m brick mortar = 0 433( ) ( ) 0 64 0 36
. . .
(12.3.1)
where
σ m = compressive strength of masonry strength in MPa
σbrick = compressive strength of brick in MPa
σ mortar = compressive strength of mortar in MPa.
Various strengths of masonry are tabulated in Table 12.1.
12.3.1  Lateral Shear Strength of Masonry
The lateral strength of masonry arises out of shear strength along bed joints. The lat￾eral strength is given by Eq. (12.3.1.1).
Q v Lt CE e = ( ) (12.3.1.1)
In Eq. (12.3.1.1), QCE is the expected lateral strength of infill panel, ve is the expected 
shear strength of masonry, L is the horizontal length of infill panel clear between 
columns, t is the thickness of infill wall. QCE can be used to find the axial capacity 
of the infill strut.

12.3.2  Force–​Deformation Behaviour of Infill Strut
The force–deformation response of infill strut as per FEMA-356 is shown in 
Figure 12.4. The parameters used in the response (namely, d, e, c) and performance 
levels (IO, LS, CP) are shown Table 12.2. The values are applicable for nonlinear 
static procedure for URM infill.
12.3.2.1 Axial Force on Infill Strut
The shear failure of masonry takes place along the bed joint planes. The bed joint 
shear strength is given by Eq. (12.3.1.1). This can be utilized to calculate the axial 
force in the infill strut. Consider Figure 12.5. The axial force is given by Eq. (12.3.2.2).
F QCE = cosθ (12.3.2.2)
where F is the axial force in strut, θ is angle inclination of strut with horizontal.

As infill is made up of brittle material, the modelling should be a force-controlled 
one. For ductile members, deformation-controlled behaviour is modelled.
12.3.2.2 Effect of Infill on Building
Infill imparts additional stiffness to the building. It is common with the designers 
to consider the weight of the infill in the model but ignore the stiffness part. As a 
result, the computed dynamic time period of building will be erroneous. We have the 
following three situations that may be encountered:
(i) Bare frame building where the weight of infill is considered but stiffness from infill is 
disregarded: time period of building Tbare (obtained from dynamic analysis).
(ii) Infill stiffness considered: time period Tactual (obtained from dynamic analysis)
(iii) Codal approximate time period Ta (obtained from code).
In all the cases, we have Tactual < Tbare.
If, Tactual > Ta, base shear correction as per code is necessary.
If, Tactual < Ta, base shear correction is not necessary.
Providing infill strut in building model also needs incorporating plastic hinges for the 
infill. It is a bit clumsy to model such plastic hinges. Because of its brittle nature, infill 
strut will fail much earlier than the frame members.
12.4 EXAMPLES
Example 12.4.1 In a building, the columns are spaced at 4 m centre to centre. The 
storey height is 3.3 m. The beam size is 300×450 mm and column size is 400 × 
400 mm. Find the thickness of infill strut in the panel and find the axial force capacity 
of the strut. Masonry is of fair quality. The concrete grade is M30. Thickness of infill 
wall is 200 mm.
Solution: Consider Figure 12.6 The length of infill = 4000 −2 × (400/2) = 3600 mm.
Height of infill panel = 3300 −2 × (450/2) = 3075 mm.
Diagonal length of infill panel = 3600 3075 2 2 + =4734.5 mm.

12.5 CLOSURE
This chapter chiefly refers to FEMA-356. Some additional information on masonry 
is available in ASCE-SEI-41-17, but this document appears to lack simplicity. 
Incorporation of masonry infill in the building model increases the stiffness and hence 
reduces the time period. But this is the ‘true’ time period of the building. More dis￾cussion on the real model can be found in Chapter 4.

13.1 INTRODUCTION
Damping in structure reduces its response and hence it is to our advantage. Structural 
response can be reduced by increasing the amount of damping. We can increase the 
damping in a system by adding damping devices, called dampers. There are various 
types of dampers, but passive damper and active damper are the basic categories. 
Active damper needs some real-time feedback to activate it. Hence, these require 
some electrical/electronic triggering. Passive dampers are activated by movement of 
the structure. There are also semi-active dampers. Passive dampers may be working 
with the orifice action of some fluid (when it is called fluid viscous damper (FVD)). 
Passive dampers may also work on the principle of mechanism, friction, rolling￾bending or yielding of metal. There are also magneto-rheological dampers and shape 
memory alloy dampers. A damper acts as a fuse and itself may get damaged during 
earthquake, thereby saving the main structure.
An FVD works on the principle of orifice action on a fluid. The fluid is filled in a 
cylinder with piston and two chambers. The fluid used should be: (i) highly viscous, 
(ii) stable over long life, (iii) chemically non-reactive and (iv) non-inflammable. 
Generally, silicone fluid is used in FVD.
Figure 13.1 shows a rough longitudinal section of an FVD. Silicone fluid remains 
partially in chambers 1 and 2. As the piston moves, the fluid changes chamber 
through the orifice. While passing through orifice, high velocity is generated in the 
compressed fluid, which does work, thereby generating heat. The kinetic work done 
and dissipated heat are the sources of damping. An accumulator chamber temporarily 
stores fluid.
The force acting in the damper due to fluid movement is given by Eq. (13.1.1).
F C v v D = ( ) α
.sign (13.1.1)
where FD is the damper force,C is a constant, v is fluid velocity, sign(v) is a sign 
of velocity and α is the index signifying the degree of nonlinearity in the fluid action. 
When α =1, it is a linear damper. As α reduces, nonlinearity increases. A real damper 
is shown in Figure 13.2.

in Figure 13.3(a). The elastic structural response is shown in Figure 13.3(b), and 
structure–damper combined response is shown in Figure 13.3(c).
The placements of damper in structure can be of various forms as shown in 
Figure 13.4.

13.2 EXISTING METHODS OF DESIGN USING FVD
The design of structure with passive dampers like friction dampers and metallic yielding 
dampers have been available in the literature for three decades. But performance￾oriented design approach is comparatively new. FEMA-356 (2000) described evalu￾ation of buildings with added dampers. Subsequent FEMA documents continued to

structural response and (c) combined structure–damper response.DDBD of RC Frame Buildings with Viscous Dampers 291
include a similar treatment. Lin et al. (2008) proposed a DDBD method for design of 
structures with viscoelastics and FVD. The damping of the damper was added to the 
structure’s damping and design was done following iterative procedure by converting 
the MDOF system to ESDOF system. Sullivan and Lago (2012) introduced a DDBD 
method for design of buildings with FVD considering damping force as a constant 
proportion to storey shears and applied it to linear FVD. Moradpour and Dehestani 
(2019) proposed a DDBD method accommodating nonlinear dampers and optimiza￾tion of the dampers. In this chapter, both linear and nonlinear dampers have been 
treated.
13.3 DDBD METHOD FOR RC FRAME BUILDINGS WITH 
DAMPERS
Sullivan and Lagos (2012) developed a DDBD method for RC frame buildings 
with supplemental dampers of FVD type. The steps involved in the design are 
described below.
Step 1: Decide design drift and hazard level.
Step 2: Find out displacement profile from Eq. (13.3.1).

Step 3: The ESDOF system properties are found out from Eqs. (13.3.2 to 13.3.4) 
with already familiar notations.

Step 3: Decide the fraction of storey shear that will be taken by the dampers. This 
is expressed by Eq. (13.3.5).
F V di i i = β (13.3.5)
where
Fdi = damper force at i-th floor
βi = fraction, showing storey shear taken by damper at i-th floor; this 
value may be also kept constant over the floors.
Vi = storey shear at i-th floor

In Figure 13.5, OA is a damper-element inclined at angle δ with hori￾zontal. The storey displacement is BC = ∆i at i-th floor. The axial deform￾ation of the damper is AC = BCcos δ. So, u cos i i i = − − (∆ ∆ )1 δ .294 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
13.4 EXAMPLES
Example 13.4.1 A 12-storey RC frame building is fitted with viscous dampers 
over all floors. The ground storey height is 4.4 m and other storey height is 3.3 
m. The floor mass is 700 kN-s2
/m and roof mass is 600 kN-s2
/m. The building is 
to be designed for a drift of 2.6%. Use yield strength of rebar as 500 MPa. Take 
the length of beam as 5 m and depth of the beam as 0.8 m. Use EC-8 spectrum 
for Soil type B at 0.6g level. Angle made by dampers with horizontal is 35°. Find 
storey lateral forces, storey shear and damper constants. Assume that dampers 
carry 20% of storey shears.
Solution: Compute ESDOF system properties
The total height of the building is H = 40.7 m. Factor for taking care of dynamic 
amplification factor is,
ωθ = 1 1. 5 0 − .0034H ≤ 1 0. = 1.15 – 0.0034 × 40.7 = 1.012; so, ωθ = 1.0.

13.5 NONLINEAR DAMPER
Damper nonlinearity is reflected by the parameter λ , which is a function of α and 
Γ, as given in Eq. (13.5.1) (Moradpour and Dehestani, 2019) where Γ is the Gamma 
function.

(13.5.1b)
Typical values of α are 1.0 (linear damper), 0.6, 0.3 and 0.15; the value of α = 0.15 
gives highest nonlinearity out of the four values mentioned.
Let us plot Eq. (13.5.1b) to see the variation of λ with α (Figure 13.7). For 
this purpose, values of Γ are required. The values of Γ for various values of α are 
tabulated in Table 13.3. We take the help of mathematical relation Γ(n +1) = nΓ(n)
and Γ(n) = − (n 1 !) Fractional values of Γ are available from Gamma tables (see 
books on mathematics).
Figure 13.7 shows that, as α increases, λ decreases, which implies nonlinearity in 
damper decreases so also the damping (Eq. 13.5.1a). At α = 1, λ = 1 (linear damper).
13.5.1  Interpretation of Equation β = 2ξ λ D /
We may keep the value of β (fraction of storey shear taken by damper) to be constant, 
or we can vary its value storey wise. The relationship between β and ξD
 given by 
Eq. (13.5.1.1) after Moradpour and Dehestani (2019).

β λ = ξ 2 D (13.5.1.1)
This can be written as Eq. (13.5.1.1a).
ξ βλ D = 2 (13.5.1.1a)
Eq. (13.5.1.1a) is plotted in Figure 13.8 for various values of β . In this plot, the value 
of α is varied from 0.9 to 0.15. These all are nonlinear dampers. As α decreases, 
nonlinearity of damper increases, but the total damping constants decreases. The 
damping in the dampers is taken as a fixed value (around 15%) in design. The value 
of ξ D more than 20% may not be practical. It is evident that ξ D increases with β . 
FIGURE 13.8 Variation of ξ D with β and λ ( ) α .
FIGURE 13.7 Variation of λ with α (Eq. 13.5.1b).DDBD of RC Frame Buildings with Viscous Dampers 299
It simply implies that as the damper has to carry more storey shear, more damping is 
demanded in the damper.
For linear damper ( λ = 1 ) and when β reamins constant over floors, we get 
Eq. (13.5.1.1b).
ξ β D = 2 (13.5.1.1b)
If β is kept constant over the storeys, ξ D also becomes constant. But it is possible 
to vary β over the storeys. One possibility is to vary β in proportion to storey drift. 
When β varies over storeys, the damping in damper is given by Eq. 13.5.1.2,

13.6 DRIFT PROPORTIONAL DAMPING FORCE
As discussed in Section 13.5.1, the damper force can be proportional to storey shear. 
Eq. (13.3.5) expresses damper force in that way. Damper is inclined to horizontal by 
angle δ . So, actual damper force along its axis is given by Eq. (13.6.1).
F

i i = β
δ (13.6.1)
Eq. (13.3.5) and (13.6.1) are similar, only values of βi will be different.
Also, Eq. (13.3.9a) is valid for linear damper ( α = 1). For nonlinear dampers, the 
damper force is given by Eq. (13.6.2) and consequently, damping constant is given 
by Eq. (13.6.3).

Values of βi can be constant or be varying with storeys. But other possibility is to vary 
it proportional to storey drift. The storey drift can be computed based on displace￾ment profile (Eq. (13.3.1a)) or based on drifts after carrying out dynamic analysis. As 300 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
damper properties are not known in the beginning, dynamic drift of building without 
damper may be used.
Now consider Eq. (13.5.1.2). The designer wishes to have a fixed percentage of 
damping arising out of dampers. So left hand side ξ D is fixed by the designer; let this 
be ξ D d, ecided . Let θi denote interstorey drift at i-th storey.
Now, the drift proportionality values of β will be given by,

is ξ D = 10%.
Solution: We use the displacement profile of Table 13.1, and compute storey drifts 
as shown Table 13.4. Let us decide (in line with Ex. 13.4.1) that damper supply 
10% damping ( ξ D d, ecided = 10%). Eq. (13.6.6) gives proportionality constant. But 
this is dependent on λ , which in turn depends upon α. So, Table 13.4 shows 
computation of damper force (as per Eq.(13.6.6)) for various values of α . From 
Ex. 13.4.1, ∆d = 0.591, Vb
 = 6910 kN. K used in Table 13.4 is obtained from Eq. 
(13.6.6).
From Table 13.4 and Figure 13.9, it is found that the damping constant 
decreases towards upper storeys. Also, the damping constant requirement 
decreases with higher nonlinearity of dampers (lower values of α ). For linear 
damper ( α = 1), the damping constant demand is highest. Hence linear damper 
will not be economical.
Example 13.6.2 With data of Ex13.6.1 and by considering drift-proportional 
damping, and taking β = 0.3 and 0.4 (that is, ξ D = 15% and 20%), get the damping 
constants. Use drift based on displacement profile. Comment on the results.
Solution: Tables 13.5 (for, ξ D = 15%) and 13.6 (for, ξ D = 20%) are prepared.
The results of Example 13.6.1 and 13.6.2 are put in condensed form in Table 13.7.
The data in Table 13.7 has been plotted in Figure 13.10. From the figure, it is quite 
evident that the sum of damper constants is very high for linear dampers, thereby indi￾cating that the linear dampers are costly. Nonlinear dampers by the same argument,

are cheaper. The cost decreases as the nonlinearity increases. However, to attain high 
nonlinearity may lead to practical problems in the manufacturing of dampers.
13.7 CLOSURE
The use of FVD in PBD has been highlighted in this chapter. The cost of damper 
is proportional to the damping coefficient. So, to reduce cost, this coefficient to be 
minimized. Examples are given to explain the application of the concept. Further 
research can be motivated through this chapter.

Displacement-Based 
Design for Bridge Piers
14.1 INTRODUCTION
Displacement-based design (DBD) method can be applied to the design of bridge 
piers. Unlike a building, a bridge has generally one mass at top of the idealized struc￾ture. Hence, the computation for ESDOF system properties is not required in the 
bridge design. A bridge has limited elements like piers, abutments and superstruc￾ture (deck). The piers are generally of dissimilar heights following the topography 
of the channel, which the bridge crosses. The piers can of different shapes like cir￾cular, oval, chamfered, square and rectangular (Figure 14.1). Mostly the sections are 
hollow. There can be more than one column in a pier system (multi-column pier). 
Circular columns are easy to construct (though form work is a bit costly). Circular 
columns have equal stiffness and strength in all directions. Also note that for bridge 
piers the design displacement parameter is strain.
14.2 DBD BASICS FOR CIRCULAR BRIDGES PIERS
Consider the circular pier section with circular ties as shown in Figure 14.2(a). The 
ties make a confining effect on the concrete. Under compressive load in column the 
confined inner core develops tendency to bulge out; this is prevented by ties with 
the development of tensile forces in the ties. This is the mechanism of confinement 
in concrete. Confinement in concrete increases its compressive strength and duc￾tility. The confinement effect depends on the ratio of volume of transverse ties to 
the volume of core concrete, called transverse steel volumetric ratio ( ) ρv . To find an 
expression of ρv
, take the hatched portion of Figure 14.2(b). The volume of concrete 
in this portion is given by Eq. (14.2.1a).
V D s c c = π

2 (14.2.1a)
where s is spacing of the circular tie, Vc is volume of core concrete within height s, 
Dc is core diameter (diametrical distance between centres of tie).
The volume of tie in this hatched portion is given by Eq. (14.2.1b).

14.3 DBD FOR CIRCULAR BRIDGE PIERS
Priestley et al. (2007) has developed a damage control displacement-based design 
for bridge piers. We present here the steps in the method in our own language. In the 
beginning, the designer will select pier diameter and core diameter. The axial load in 
column has to be supplied.
Step 1: The transverse steel volumetric ratio ρv is found out from Eq. (14.2.2). 
While using this equation, the designer has already chosen the yield strength of 
tie bar, tie diameter and tie spacing.
Step 2: The confined compressive strength of concrete f
con is calculated by using 
Eq. (14.2.7b) or by using Figure 14.3.

Step 3: Calculate the damage control strain ( ) ε d in compression concrete by using

14.4 DDBD FOR BRIDGES PIERS
Bridge has only one vertical level of mass, namely, at bearing/deck level. The question 
arises – can we apply DDBD method in bridge? Well, in vertical direction DDBD 
method is not applicable, but it can be applied in horizontal direction, considering all 
piers together, and their lateral sway. The top view of a bridge is shown in Figure 14.4.

15 UPBD for Bridge Piers
15.1 INTRODUCTION
We have seen the DDB for bridge piers in Chapter 14, where only drift could be sat￾isfied as a target performance objective. In this chapter, we shall see how PL along 
with the drift can also be accommodated in the UPBD method for bridge piers. The 
UPBD method for circular bridge piers was proposed by Banerjee (2020) and later 
on further strengthened by Banerjee and Choudhury (2020a, 2020b). This chapter 
will be mainly reflecting on these three works. We confine ourselves to RC circular 
bridge piers.
Figure 15.1 shows a typical bridge section. The effective mass over an individual 
bridge pier is the sum of: (i) mass from superstructure of length stretched to half 
of the spans on either side of pier and, (ii) one third of the mass of pier (Priestley 
et al., 2007). This mass works over the equivalent single degree of freedom (ESDOF) 
system which the pier assembly is converted to. Figure 15.2 shows a pier assembly 
and the ESDOF system.
15.2 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
In the UPBD method, we wish to design the structure for a given drift and PL under 
a given hazard level. Let the target design drift for the bridge pier be θd
 and the PL is 
indicated by plastic rotation of pier to angle θp
. Let the yield rotation of pier by θy
. The 
angular drift consists of the yield rotation and plastic rotation. This can be expressed 
by Eq. (15.2.1) and explained through Figure 15.3.
θ θ θ d y p = + (15.2.1)
Now we look at finding the expression for θ y

FEMA-356 or SEI documents. The values of θ p for various PLs, as per ASCE-SEI￾41-13 are given below.

15.2.2  Modified Expression for Pier Diameter
It was observed by Banerjee and Choudhury (2020a, 2020b) that the bridge system is 
very stiff compared to buildings and achieved drift by using Eq. (15.2.1.6) was much 
less than the target drift. This is due to the reason that abutment makes the bridge lat￾erally very stiff. So, drift correction factor ( λ ) was introduced in the equation leading 
to the Eq. (15.2.2.1).

Eq. (15.2.1.2) can be used with vales of C and φ y for rectangular section.320 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
15.3 DESIGN STEPS FOR UPBD METHOD FOR BRIDGE PIERS
The design steps under UPBD method for bridge pier design are given below.
Step 1: The supplied (that is, obtained from client) data are: the design drift (θ ) d , 
and PL (θ ) p and hazard level.
Modified drift (θ′ ) d is obtained from Eq. (15.2.2.2).
Step 2: Diameter of the per is obtained from Eq. (15.2.2.1).
Step 3: The bridge pier is idealized as an ESDOF system. The ESDOF system 
properties are calculated. Equivalent mass (m ) e is the summation of the mass of 
half the length of the superstructure on both the sides of the concerned pier and 
one third the mass of the pier. The equivalent height (H ) e equals to the distance 
between the base of the pier to the centre of the bearing.
Step 3: Yield rotation (θy
) is obtained from Eq. (15.2.1.1). Ductility is obtained as 
shown below.

generated for various damping values (Figure 15.4).
FIGURE 15.4 Displacement Spectra for EC-8 at 0.45g level for soil type B.UPBD for Bridge Piers 321
Step 6: Effective time period (Te

corresponding to the effective damping ( ) ξe and modified design displace￾ment (∆′ = ′ = ) d dHe dHe θ λθ .
Step 7: Effective stiffness (K ) e for the system is calculated from Eq. (15.3.2). The 
base shear ( ) Vb is given by Eq. (15.3.3).

Unlike that in building bridge has only one mass level at top. The base shear ( ) Vb
is applied at the top of the effective height of the pier.
Step 8: Design is carried out with expected strength of the materials. For concrete, 
it is taken as 1.5 times the 28-day characteristic strength, and that of steel it is 
as 1.25 times the yield strength of reinforcement bars (FEMA-356). The load 
combinations are as follows:
D L +
D L Fx + ±
D L Fy + ±
Here, D stands for dead load, L stands for live load, and Fx , Fy stand for the 
seismic loads in two mutually perpendicular directions of the bridge.
15.4 EXAMPLES

Bearing height is 400 mm and deck system thickness is 200 mm. Weight of segment of 
superstructure including half spans on each side of pier is 1000 kN. The pier is to be 
designed for 1.8% drift and LS PL in seismic zone V of India. Find the diameter of the 
pier. Take Fe415 grade rebar of 20 mm diameter for longitudinal bars.

Devices
16.1 INTRODUCTION
Damping reduces the response of the structures and as such, it works as a protec￾tion against damage to the structures. The damping in the structure can be increased 
by adding additional damping devices. The devices so added are known as energy 
dissipation devices (EDD). The damping obtained through EDDs is known as 
added damping. The total damping (ξtotal
) arises out of: (i) material damping ( ξ m ), 
(ii) hysteretic damping (ξ h ) and (iii) added damping (ξ a ), as shown in Eq. (16.1.1a). 
In normal buildings, the elements are damaged during earthquakes of a very high 
magnitude. In most of the cases, the damage may be beyond repair. The EDDs act 
like fuses and may get damaged during a strong earthquake, thereby saving the 
main structural components. The damaged EDD can be replaced after the earth￾quake. There are various types of EDDs, such as friction dampers, metallic yielding 
dampers, fluid viscous dampers, viscoelastic dampers, shape memory alloys and 
magneto-rheological dampers. Each variety of EDD has many sub-variants. Some of 
the dampers are discussed in this chapter.

It may be noted that Eq. (16.1.3) is applicable when the structure is considered as 
an MDOF system and there are multiple dampers in the system. If the system is 
idealized to a single SDOF system for the structure and an SDOF system for the 
damper, then the dynamic equation reduces to (16.1.4).

Dampers can be classified into three broad categories:
(i) Passive dampers
(ii) Semi-active dampers
(iii) Active dampers.
The passive dampers do not require any external power to operate; the motion of 
the structure sets them in action. Active dampers require an external power to get 326 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
activated during the earthquakes. Semi-active dampers are in between the passive and 
active types, requiring some power to operate.
In active dampers, the external power supply triggers the motion of the damping 
system such that it opposes the motion of the main structure, induced by the ground 
motion. Active dampers are generally sophisticated and efficient. The problems with 
the active dampers are as follows: (i) they are costly, (ii) they require specialized skill 
for installation and (iii) they may not work in case of power failure, unless there is a 
huge power backup system. Dampers are also called control systems, especially in 
case of active systems.
Active control devices operate on the principle of hydraulic actuators, which 
produce force opposite to that of the excitation. Active control devices are of many 
types, some of these being active mass damper (AMD), active tendons (AT) and 
active variable stiffness (AVS). AMDs are also effective against wind vibration. 
FIGURE 16.2 Working of an active control system.
FIGURE 16.1 Working of a passive control system.Energy Dissipating Devices 327
The diagrammatic working of passive dampers and active dampers is shown in 
Figures 16.1 and 16.2, respectively.
The force–deformation behaviour of friction damper is rectangular. The movement 
of friction surfaces start at some fixed force. The displacement reaches a maximum 
value and the system becomes standstill for a moment. When the displacement takes 
place in the opposite direction, it follows a similar path with negative (reversed) force 
(Figure 16.3a).
The yielding metallic damper initially undergoes elastic deformation and finally 
yields. After yielding, the force may slightly increase due to strain hardening. The 
reverse movement occurs with some lag and it forms a typical hysteresis loop 
(Figure 16.3b).
Fluid viscous damper also shows movement practically at some finite force. As 
orifice action is just similar in forward and backward movements of the fluid, the 
force–deformation behaviour is elliptical (Figure 16.3c).
The viscoelastic damper has both elastic component and viscous fluid 
action component. So, the force–displacement relationship is inclined ellipse 
(Figure16.3d).
FIGURE 16.3 Force–displacement behaviour of dampers: (a) friction damper, (b) hysteretic 
damper, (c) fluid viscous damper, (d) viscoelastic damper, (e) friction damper with self-centring 
capability and (f) fluid viscous damper with self-restoring capability.328 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
Friction damper with restoring capacity show force–displacement loop as two 
quadrilaterals in the positive and negative sectors (Figure 16.3e).
The fluid damper with a restoring capability has the loops that are continuous over 
the positive and negative sectors (Figure 16.3f).
Damper is generally placed in braces. The flexibility of the brace affects the per￾formance of the damper. If the brace flexibility is not considered, it leads to an over￾estimation of damping.
The damping in a damper in a structure at k-th mode is given by Eq. (16.1.5)

damping coefficient of the i-th damper, ωk is the k-th modal frequency, mj is the j-th 
lumped mass and φ j is the mode shape coefficient of j-th mass.
16.2 FRICTION DAMPERS
Friction dampers works on the principle of friction between surfaces arising out of 
the movement of the surfaces in contact with each other. Friction pads are used in the 
plates to enhance friction. The amount of damping mainly depends on the quantum 
of movement of the surfaces, coefficient of friction between surfaces and normal 
reaction arising out of grip force between the surfaces. Figure 16.4 shows a friction 
damper where friction takes place between the flange of the beam and the friction 
pad. Figure 16.5 shows a double-action friction damper.
The frictional force in the damper can be expressed by Eq. (16.2.1) (Li and 
Reinhorn, 1995):

Where Ff is the friction force in the damper, k is the stiffness of the damper, µ max
is the maximum coefficient of friction that occurs at the start of the movement, µ min
is the minimum coefficient of friction that occurs after sliding occurs and R is 
the normal reaction. It may be noted that friction force can be positive or negative 
depending on the direction of motion. It always opposes the applied force.
In order to have a normal reaction, there should be a grip between two sliding 
surfaces. This is achieved through bolting or spring action.
Figure 16.6 shows a friction damper in action with central links. Frictional energy 
dissipation takes place in the link due to friction among plates in the links. This 
damper can be easily fixed in the diagonal brace system.
Figure 16.7 shows Sumitomo friction damper reported by Aiken et al. (1992).
Figure 16.8 shows an arrangement of friction damper in a steel structure.
Slotted bolted connection (SBC) is a simple and low-cost friction damper 
(Figure 16.9). This type of damper was reported by Fitzgerald et al. (1989). 
The main feature of this damper is a slotted plate connected to another plate by 
bolting. The slot allows movement of the plate. The bolt gives necessary grip and 
normal force.
An arrangement of EDD in a building is shown in Figure 16.10.
16.3 YIELDING METALLIC DAMPERS
The yielding metallic dampers work on the principle of hysteresis of metals (gener￾ally mild steel). Hysteresis is the lag between the input force and output deformation. 
The energy dissipated in one hysteretic cycle is the area under the hysteresis 
loop. Larger hysteresis loop indicates more energy dissipation. A larger area of the 
FIGURE 16.5 Double action friction damper.330 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
loop will occur when the inelastic deformation is large, without failure. Some of the 
metallic plate dampers are explained briefly in the following.
16.3.1  Constricted Plate Damper
An yielding metallic damper with a dumbbell-shaped plates yields easily at the 
constricted area of the plate. Once inelasticity sets in, the hysteresis loops will be 
generated in to-and-fro motion caused by earthquakes. A schematic diagram of the 
damper is shown in Figure 16.11.
16.3.2  Rolling Bending Damper
Rolling bending dampers are made of plates bent in an elliptical shape. Two faces of 
the dampers are welded to moving parts of the structure. As the structural parts move 
relative to each other, the plate rolls and bends in rolling. The damper may also touch 
FIGURE 16.7 Sumitomo friction device (schematic).
FIGURE 16.6 Friction damper with links.Energy Dissipating Devices 331
the inelastic range. The energy is dissipated during rolling–bending and through hys￾teresis action. A schematic view of the damper is shown in Figure 16.12.
The demerit of yielding metallic dampers is during minor earthquakes, they may 
not yield and will act as an added stiffness.
16.4 FLUID VISCOUS DAMPERS
Fluid viscous damper (FVD) is being used since long in shock absorbing devices in 
the automobile industry. It has also been used in the airplane wheel shock absorbing 
FIGURE 16.9 Slotted bolted connection.
FIGURE 16.8 Typical placement of a Sumitomo friction device.332 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
mechanism. FVD acts on the principle of fluid flow through orifice. They are also 
known as hydraulic dampers.
The movement of fluid produces a drag or resistance to any object within it. This 
is because of viscous force that is generated during the movement. On the other hand, 
if the fluid passes through an orifice, it does some work and as a result energy gets 
dissipated. This is the principle of fluid viscous dampers.
The force acting in the damper due to fluid movement given by Eq. (16.4.1).

FIGURE 16.11 Yielding metallic damper with dumbbell-shaped plates.
FIGURE 16.10 An arrangement of dampers in a steel frame building.Energy Dissipating Devices 333
where FD is the damper force, u is fluid velocity, sign(u) is the sign of velocity and 
α is the index signifying the degree of nonlinearity in the fluid action. When α =1, 
it is a linear damper. As α reduces, nonlinearity increases. The force–deformation 
response of FVD depends on the frequency of excitation.
Where FD is the force in the damper due to movement of the fluid, the dis￾placement of fluid is the velocity of the fluid. The sign of the velocity decides the 
positive and negative nature of the force, that is, its direction of action. The FVD 
is used not only in structural response control, but also in gun recoil control, air￾plane shock absorber and various other hydraulic controls. A general picture of a 
FVD is shown in Figure 16.13. It consists of a cylinder and piston. The cylinder 
contains a highly viscous silicone fluid. The fluid moves by the movement of 
piston caused by the earthquake (when tied diagonally in braces). The fluid has an 
accumulator to accumulate the fluid when compressed. There are orifices through 
which fluid moves, and in the process, work is done. The work done is a measure 
of energy dissipated in the process.
FIGURE 16.13 Fluid viscous damper.
FIGURE 16.12 Rolling–bending damper: (a) elevation and (b) plan.334 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
The efficiency and usefulness of FVD depends on (i) fluid viscosity, (ii) stroke 
length, (iii) orifice action and (iv) velocity of fluid movement. The cost of FVD is 
proportional to the damping coefficient to be attained in the damper.
16.5 VISCOUS WALL DAMPER
A viscous wall damper consists of a steel plate and is submerged in viscous fluid 
contained in a wall. The submerged wall moves under the influence of the earthquake. 
The drag generates force and work is done by the earthquake motion. The work done 
is nothing but energy dissipated. The amount of energy dissipated depends on the 
movement of the immersed plate and the area of the plate. Obviously, it depends 
also on the viscosity of the fluid inside. Such walls have been used in Japan. The 
force generated in the viscous wall is given by Eq. (16.5.1). A viscous wall damper is 
shown in Figure 16.14.
F = µuA (16.5.1)
where F is the force of drag that acts in a direction opposite to the direction of the 
earthquake motion, µ is the coefficient of viscosity of the fluid, u is the velocity of 
the moving wall and A surface is the area of the moving wall.
For linear viscous response, Eq. (16.5.2) is valid.

gives the response as an oval shape (Figure 16.15).

16.6 VISCOELASTIC DAMPERS
Viscoelastic dampers (VED) consist of one or more layer of viscoelastic material 
such as an acrylic polymer sandwiched between metal elements. The movement in 
the metal element cause the VE material to undergo reversible shear deformation. 
Through this process, hysteresis energy is dissipated. VEDs are influenced by oper￾ating frequencies and temperature. VEDs have been used in many important buildings 
including the World Trade Centre (110 stories), Columbia SeeFirst Building (73 
stories) and Union Square Building (60 stories) (Li and Reinhorn, 1995).
The relationship between the shear stress and shear strain in VEDs is given by Eq. 
(16.6.1).

Gloss is shear loss modulus= τ δ γ 0 0 sin /
γ 0 =peak shear strain
γ (t) =time varying shear strain
δ =phase angle between shear stress and shear strain.
Eq. (16.6.1) is graphically shown in Figure 16.16. The ratio of shear loss modulus and 
shear storage modulus is called the loss factor. A higher loss factor indicates more 
efficiency of the damper in dissipating energy.
Loss factor = G G/ loss storage .
VE dampers consists of two outer plates and an inner plate with two layers of VE 
material on two sides of the inner plate (Figure 16.17). As VEDs have both stiffness 
and damping, they can be modellea d as spring-dashpot system.
FIGURE 16.15 Response of a linear viscous wall damper.336 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
The spring-dash pot model of a VED-structure is shown in Figure 16.18. The struc￾ture has its stiffness and material damping. The damper has its stiffness and damping. 
The VED acts along the brace, so the stiffness of brace comes in series with the VED.
With the notations ks for stiffness of the structure, m for mass of the structure￾damper-brace, kb for stiffness of the brace, kd
 for stiffness of the damper, kbd the 
combined stiffness of the brace and damper and Tsd for time period of structure￾damper system, And the brace and damper being in series, we can write

16.7 ECCENTRICALLY BRACED FRAMES
Eccentrically braced frames (EBF) are used to increase stiffness in steel frame buildings. 
The concentrically braced frame (CBF) also increases the stiffness but the EBF has better 
hysteretic energy dissipating capacity. The hysteretic behaviour is concentrated in EBF 
through a capacity design, so that other members remain elastic (see Figure 16.19).
The joint between the brace and frame is through a shear link, which dissipates 
energy through nonlinear actions. The behaviour of EBF depends on the post-buckling 
cyclic behaviour of individual braces.

diagonal, (d) EBF with two diagonals, (e) inverted Y-brace and (f) EBF.Energy Dissipating Devices 339
16.8 ELASTOMERIC SPRING DEVICE
Elastomer is a silicon-based material. An elastomeric spring damper utilizes 
pressurized compressible elastomer. The compressibility of the elastomer gives rise 
to spring action and the viscous property of the elastomer gives it the hysteretic 
property. The damper imposes damping and stiffness on the system. There is a load 
value up to which the elastomer remains stiff; beyond this force, the elastomer flows 
through the orifice in the piston head. On the removal of load, the pre-pressure takes 
the damper to the original state. Elastomeric spring devices are used in end-of rack 
buffer, car-to-car coupling system, shock absorbing device in missiles and torpedoes, 
steel mills, material handling units, etc. (Pekcan et al., 1995).
Eq. (16.8.1) was proposed by Pekcan et al. (1995).

A schematic view of an elastomeric damper is shown in Figure 16.20. The force–

16.9 SHAPE MEMORY ALLOY
Shape memory alloys (SMA) are special alloys that can ‘remember’ their original 
shape. On removal of the load, the element goes back to its original shape. In other 
words, SMAs are self-centring. Thus, they can repeatedly yield without rupture. The 
material of the SMA undergoes a reversible phase transformation. The hysteresis loop 
of SMA is an inclined elongated shape.

16.10 LEAD EXTRUSION DEVICES
Lead extrusion devices (LED) can dissipate energy through hysteresis. Their behav￾iour is like the friction devices. LEDs have been used in real buildings in New Zealand 
(Reinhorn and Li, 1995). LEDs are stable devices and can sustain a large number of 
cycles of operation. These are largely not affected by environmental factors such as 
temperature and hysteresis. A schematic diagram of lead extrusion device is shown 
in Figure 16.22.
16.11 CLOSURE
In this chapter, general descriptions of different types of energy dissipating devices 
are given. EDDs have found large-scale applications in structural response mitigation. 
They are passive damping devices. To apply the dampers in a real structure, readers 
may have to undertake a detailed study on the devices, their modelling and dynamic 
behaviours. There can be a mixture of two or more damper types in a structure.

Tuned Liquid Damper
17.1 INTRODUCTION
Any liquid when accelerated under an earthquake in a container experiences an inertia 
force in a direction opposite to the direction of the earthquake force, which causes the 
motion. So, if the liquid container is put in a structure, the opposite inertia force of 
the liquid will try to mitigate the earthquake response of the structure. The movement 
of the water in a container is called sloshing. Tuned liquid damper (TLD) is such a 
liquid container that has been engineered in some way that it is “tuned” to the struc￾ture to arrive at the maximum benefit of sloshing force. The motion of the liquid 
and structure are explained in Figure 17.1. The gravitational force generated by the 
liquid mass, the viscous interactive force out of liquid interaction with the rigid con￾tainer and transitional force due to liquid movement within columns causes energy 
dissipation. The mechanism of TLDs in controlling the vibrations of the structures is 
based on the action of liquid sloshing and wave breaking. Both these actions produce 
damping in in the TLD through energy dissipation by the action of internal fluid 
viscous force and from breaking of the waves. The quantum of damping induced 
depends on the amplitude of the liquid motion in the tank and wave patterns of wave 
breaking. TLD is designed to be in tune with the natural frequency of the structure, 
but its action should be out of phase. In that case, TLD will help reduce the structural 
response like story drift, floor response and roof displacements.
The first installation of TLD on a real structure was on the 42 m high Nagasaki 
airport tower in 1987 (Tamura et al., 1995). This was followed by Yokohama Marine 
Tower and Tokyo international airport tower in Japan (Tamura et al., 1995).
With reference to Figure 17.1, as the structure moves to the right, the liquid sloshes 
to left and vice versa. Thus, the water sloshing action tries to diminish the motion of 
the building by acting in the opposite direction.
There are various types of TLDs as described below.
1. Flat bottom TLD: A flat bottom TLD is a rectangular tank with liquid 
(Figure 17.1(a)). The normal liquid is water. The viscosity of the liquid leads 
to damping in the system. Flat bottom TLD is called the shallow type when 
the depth to length of water is less than or equal to 0.15; otherwise, it is called 
deep water TLD. Shallow-type TLD exhibits nonlinearity in liquid movement 
17Tuned Liquid Damper 343
and shows wave breaking. The mass ratio is the ratio of mass of liquid in 
the tank to the structural mass. The efficiency of the TLD depends on the 
mass ratio.
2. Slope bottom TLD: The concept of slope bottom TLD is analogous to seashore 
or tsunami waves near the shore. Near the shore, the sea bottom is sloped 
towards the sea. As such, the waves moving towards the shore confront an 
upward sloping bottom, thereby generating turbulence and the wave energy is 
dissipated. Slope bottom TLD may have V-shaped or trough-shaped bottom 
(Figure 17.2). As the liquid moves upgradient in the slope, sloshing action, 
turbulence and wave breaking cause energy dissipation. Slope bottom TLD 
induces more mass participation from the liquid. The frequency of the TLD 
FIGURE 17.2 Slope bottom TLD: (a) V-shape and (b) trough shape.
FIGURE 17.1 Motion of liquid in the tank: (a) tank with liquid, (b) front view of the tank, 
(c) liquid sloshing to the right, (d) liquid sloshing to the left, (e) building moving to the right 
with the tank and (f) building moving to the left with the tank.344 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
should be slightly higher than the natural frequency of the structure for better 
performance.
3. Perforated screen TLD: The liquid in the tank may be allowed to pass through 
a perforated wall while sloshing (Figure 17.3). This will set an orifice action 
in motion and dissipate energy in the movement of water. It is possible to 
put multiple walls too. It is also possible to achieve the desired damping by 
adjusting the hole area to the total screen area (called solidity ratio).
4. Multiple TLD: A series of tanks with liquid can be used to increase the total energy 
dissipation through TLD. The number of TLDs can be decided based on the energy 
dissipation requirement. A schematic multiple tank is shown in Figure 17.4.
5. TLD with baffle wall: Baffle wall is a wall put at some angle in the TLD. This 
acts as a barrier to the flow of water, thereby dissipating energy. Multiple 
baffle walls can be put inside a tank. Baffle walls are also used to diminish the 
destructive action of sloshing in normal liquid retaining tanks.
6. Tuned liquid column dampers (TLCD): Two arms of a continuous U-shaped 
tube can allow sloshing action during the motion of TLD (Figure 17.5). There 
is a constriction orifice in the horizontal arm that causes energy dissipation. 
The horizontal leg may be smaller in diameter to increase the efficiency 
(Figure 17.6). The efficiency of the TLCD depends on the diameter of the 
tube, orifice size, horizontal arm length and vertical height of the liquid in the 
vertical arms. The rise of liquid in arms against gravity also causes work to be 
done and energy dissipation.
FIGURE 17.4 Multiple TLD.
FIGURE 17.3 Perforated wall TLD.Tuned Liquid Damper 345
TLD with water as liquid is the most common one in use. Water is also 
cheaply available. However, water has low viscosity and hence can dissipate 
less energy. A liquid with a higher viscosity may be used for better perform￾ance. Also, a liquid of a higher density works better. The density of water may 
be increased by mixing salt or sugar. The frictional force at tank bottom can be 
increased by putting non-soluble granular materials like clean sand. A number 
of floating balls may be used to increase damping and reduce wave beating. 
The TLD of other shapes may also be experimented with.
7. Tuned liquid column ball dampers (TLCBD): Here a metallic ball is placed in 
the horizontal arm of the TLD (Figure 17.7). The provision of the ball leads to 
an orifice action and that increases the efficiency of the system in dissipating 
energy.
17.2 DYNAMICS OF TLD
In this section, we study the dynamic background of TLDs. We first look at some basic 
definitions and formulae in this connection. The critical damping ratio in general is 
FIGURE 17.6 TLCD with a constricted horizontal arm.

the left.346 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
ξ = c ccritical / . Also, we know ccritical = 2mω and ω π = 2 f , Putting these for liquid of 
TLD, we can write Eq. (17.2.1).
c m f critical L L = 4π (17.2.1)
where f
L is the frequency of the liquid movement in the tank.
mL is the mass of the liquid in TLD.
Mass ratio: The ratio of the mass of TLD to the mass of structure (ms ) is called as 
mass ratio (µ m ). Neglecting the mass of tank body of TLD and considering only 
liquid mass (mL ), the mass ratio is expressed as Eq. (17.2.2).

increase of h/L ratio.

A TLD-structure system is shown in Figure 17.10. In this figure, ms is the mass of 
structure, ks is the stiffness of the structure, mL is mass of the liquid in the tank and 
kL is the stiffness of TLD. We may combine the spring force and damping force in 
TLD by a variable FL . With this, we can write the equation of motion of the TLD￾structure system as Eq. (17.2.7). In this equation ug is ground acceleration.

et al., 1998).

where hleft is the depth of water on the left (receding) side and hright is the depth of 
water on the right (rising) side, B is the width of the tank, ρ is density of the liquid. 
Obviously, the force is higher when sloshing height is higher.
17.3 MODELLING OF WATER IN A TANK
Under ground motion, water in a tank on movement produces a dynamic effect on the 
wall of the tank. The modelling of water is a challenging concept. The dynamic force 
in water can be roughly modelled by dividing the total water in the tank into two cat￾egories: (i) impulsive water mass ( mi ), which acts like a rigid body, and (i) convective 
FIGURE 17.10 TLD-structure motion.Tuned Liquid Damper 349
water mass ( mc ), which is more turbulent. The impulsive mass of water interacts with 
the tank wall. The convective water mass works through the sloshing action. The 
line of action of impulsive mass from base of the tank is taken as hi and the line of 
action of convective mass of water from the base of the tank is designated by hc . 
Figure 17.11 illustrates the modelling.
17.4 CLOSURE
Different types of TLDs have been highlighted in this chapter. A brief idea of the 
working of TLD has been presented. Some modelling aspects have been discussed. If 
this creates interest in the mind of the reader, material available in the literature may 
be explored.

Tuned Mass Dampers
18.1 INTRODUCTION
Tuned mass damper (TMD) acts on the principle of the two-degree of freedom system 
where the main structure is attached with an additional mass, which is tuned to some 
desired frequency with respect to the frequency of the structure. The mass of the damper 
is much smaller than the mass of the structure. The ratio of mass of the damper to the mass 
of the structure is called mass ratio. The characteristics of TMD largely depend on the 
mass ratio. TMD has its associated damping and stiffness. TMD is very efficient in redu￾cing structural response, is easy to frame and does not generally need any external power 
source to activate it. However, the demerits are that it is heavy, requires large space and 
unless special care is taken, it is affected by frictional resistance in the assembly.
The concept TMD was supposed to be first applied to reduce the rolling motion of ships.

Assuming trial solution as

where Us is the peak amplitude of the structure and UTMD is the peak amplitude 
of TMD.

EXCITATION
We consider that base or ground movement ( ( u t)) g is expressed as
u t u pt g go ( ) = sin (18.3.1)
where ugo is the peak ground displacement.
Consider Figure 18.3. The equations of motion of structure and TMD can be 
expressed as

The right-hand sides of the above equations are obtained from the analogy of centri￾fugal force in circular motion.

19.1 GENERAL
Any building system consists of two major components: the structural components 
and the non-structural components. Non-structural components are not designed 
to carry loads. There can be structural–non-structural interaction under dynamic 
conditions. As the safety of non-structural components is to be taken care of by the 
structural engineer, a new name has been assigned to them, namely, operational and 
functional components (OFC). The OFCs necessarily involve the functional purposes 
of the building. As the loss of functionality of a building means downtime loss, the 
safety of OFCs is very important. The OFCs can be broadly classified as (a) archi￾tectural/civil, (b) mechanical, (c) electrical and (d) equipment. Very often, more than 
one such entity may be involved in an OFC. In some buildings like hospitals, the cost 
of OFCs constitutes about 85% of the total cost of the building. Thus, the protection 
of OFCs is important from an economic viewpoint too. The failure of OFCs may lead 
to inaccessibility to egress, fire hazard, chemical and gas hazard, death of patients in 
hospitals, content damage, economic loss, disruption of services, downtime loss and 
falling hazard that may lead to casualty and death, failure of the sprinkler system, 
spalling of outer concrete from reinforced concrete members, sliding or overturning 
of unanchored or wrongly anchored equipment.
The safety of OFCs is very often related to the anchoring the OFC. Any cantilever 
system (horizontal or vertical) needs to be properly designed at the base. IS-1893 
suggests the design for five times the normal horizontal seismic action. All equipment 
should be properly anchored/fixed at the base. Even the hospital beds should be 
anchored. Some OFCs may be base isolated.
The categories of OFCs are given in Table 19.1.
The seismic safety of OFCs involve IO, LS and CP damage states.
So far as the design criteria and damageability are concerned, OFCs can be 
classified as:
(i) Acceleration-sensitive OFCs and
(ii) Drift-sensitive OFCs.
19Seismic Safety of OFCs 363
Acceleration-sensitive OFCs with large mass are subjected to higher inertia forces. 
Drift-sensitive OFCs are mounted horizontally or vertically over a large length. Some 
OFCs may be both drift (or deformation) sensitive and acceleration sensitive; in that 
case, these are called deformation-sensitive OFCs (FEMA-356). It may be noted 
that any element is simultaneously subjected to deformation and acceleration; the 
question is which component is more critical for the OFC.
Examples of acceleration-sensitive OFCs are boilers, generator, transformer, 
stairs, lift, appendages, balcony, chimneys, stacks, HVAC system, storage tanks and 
water heaters.
Examples of drift sensitive items are infill walls, wall-mounted vertical equipment, 
wall-mounted horizontal equipment, suspended ceilings, claddings and tiles.
19.2 COMPUTATION OF SEISMIC FORCE ON OFCS
FEMA-356 gives a table (Table 11.1 of FEMA-356) describing what analysis can be 
carried out for a particular OFC. Force analysis, deformation analysis and prescrip￾tive analysis are the three types of analyses described in FEMA-356. Based on such a 
description, the force equation applicable shall vary.
19.2.1  Default Force When Force Analysis Is Permitted
The default equations are (19.2.1.1) and (19.2.1.2) for horizontal and vertical seismic 
forces, respectively (after FEMA-356).

ROFC varies from 1.5 to 4 depending on the type of OFC; the value of af varies 
from 1 to 2.5 (Table 11-2 of FEMA-356) (Figure 19.2).
19.2.3  General Equation in Force Analysis: Vertical Design Force

(19.2.3.1), subject to minimum force given by Eq. (19.2.3.2).

The graphical representation of Eqs. (19.2.3.1) and (19.2.3.2) are shown in 
Figure 19.3. From the figure, it is clear that the actual force will highly depend on the 
value of ROFC. Depending on the value of RFC, the computed values may be lower or 
higher than the minimum vertical design force.

where
∆OFC =relative seismic deflection of OFC
∆A =deflection of building A at level of OFC
∆B =deflection of building B, at the same level.
19.3 FLOOR RESPONSE SPECTRA
The machine and equipment foundation often rest on the building floor at some height. 
For obtaining the design force for such foundation, the design spectrum of the code is 
not applicable. The reason is that the machine foundation, unlike the building foun￾dation, is not ground-anchored. As the machine rests at some height from the ground, 
there is an amplification of acceleration response. In fact, the spectral acceleration of 
the floor is to be used for the design of the machine foundation on a floor. The spec￾tral acceleration plot for floor is the plot of peak responses of the SDOF system with 
some damping subjected to the acceleration of the floor. As the floor may be subjected 
to different acceleration histories under different ground motions, a series of spectral 
acceleration histories of the floor is possible. It is wise to take an average of all such 
spectral acceleration plots and when done so, it is called the average floor spectra. 
Such average floor spectra can be used for designing a foundation resting on the floor. 
Remember that average floor spectra is floor-specific.
19.4 RESPONSE AMPLIFICATION
Floor dynamic responses like displacement response and acceleration response get 
magnified towards higher floors due to dynamic amplification. The following are 
three common amplification parameters of interest in floor response study:
(i) Floor amplification factor (FAF)
(ii) Component amplification factor (CAF)
(iii) Total amplification factor (TAF)
FAF is the ratio of peak floor acceleration (PFA) to the peak ground acceler￾ation (PGA):
FAF PFA
PGA = (19.4.1)368 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
CAF is the ratio of peak floor spectral acceleration (PFSA) to the PFA:
CAF PFSA
PFA = (19.4.2)
TAF is the PFSA to the effective peak ground acceleration (EPGA).
TAF PFSA
EPGA = (19.4.3)
Considering ROFC as constant, the FAF can be expressed as 1 2
+ 

 


h
H . Hence, the 
graph of FAF is drawn and shown in Figure 19.4. The graph shows that the FAF 
increases with height of OFC and reaches a maximum value of 3.0. FAF value of 1.0 
at ground level indicates that there is no amplification at that level.
The plot for CAF and TAF needs the knowledge of the floor spectral acceleration 
and value of EPGA. Floor spectral acceleration is obtained from the plot of floor 
spectra, which are building-specific.
19.5 EXAMPLES
Example 19.5.1 Find the design force on an OFC of weight 100 kN for IO per￾formance. Assume that force analysis is applicable. Use Indian design spectrum for 
Zone V.
Solution: For the Indian design spectrum, the spectral acceleration for short period 
Sas =2.5.
FIGURE 19.4 Plot of FAF with height ratio of OFC.Seismic Safety of OFCs 369

Both the design forces act through the centre of mass of OFC.
Example 19.5.2 As per the general condition, find the design force on a generator of 
weight 150 kN located at a height 15 m of a hospital building of height 30 m. Assume 
EC-8 spectrum at 0.4 seismicity level.
Solution: As per Table 11-2 of FEMA-356, for Electrical equipment af =1.0 and 
ROFC =3.0. Also, for EC-8 Sas =3.0. Hospital building should be designed for IO 
performance of equipment; so, I=1.5.

Assume that force analysis is applicable. Use Indian design spectrum for Zone V.

of weight 1500 kN located at height 5 m of a hospital building of height 30

19.7 CLOSURE
The seismic safety of OFCs is equally important as that of the structure. The damage 
of OFCs leads to downtime loss, repairing cost and replacing cost. Adequate design 
is necessary for OFCs resting on building floor or mounted on walls.

Miscellaneous Topics
20.1 GENERAL
In this chapter, some additional items related to seismic safety and design are 
discussed. The topics include basics of probability in seismic design and seismic fra￾gility analysis of structures, damage index and seismic base isolation.
20.2 PRELIMINARY OF PROBABILITY
20.2.1 Statistical Terms
Probability is a mathematical concept which finds application in diverse fields. In 
fact, in most cases, our knowledge about the world is more of a probabilistic nature 
rather than deterministic. Recent advancements in performance-based seismic design 
are highly probability oriented. When we design a building for IO, LS or CP, there 
arises the question as to how much is the probability that the building will show 
the target PL. This is another way of determining the reliability of the structure. Set 
theory is intimately related to the probability study. We explain some of the basic 
terms in probability.
Probability: Probability means the chance of an event occurring in some chosen way.
It may be noted that the number of ways an event can occur in a chosen way 
depends on the total number of ways the event can occur. In the famous head–tail 
example of a coin, there are only two ways the face can show up; so, the probability of 
a head (or tail) showing up is ½ or 50%. A six-faced die can show one face at a time. 
So, the probability of showing any face (say, pip 4) is 1/6.
Definition: If a particular event takes place n times out of total N times of total 
occurrence, the probability of occurrence of the event is n/N.
Sample space: The set of all possible occurrences of some phenomenon is called 
sample space (S). An element (a particular outcome) of S is called sample point.
The parameters that can describe the trend and characteristics of a sample are 
mean, median, mode, standard deviation and variance.
20Miscellaneous Topics 373
Mean (also called the expected value) is the average of the algebraic sum of all 
elements in a sample space. If there are N elements in sample space and any i-th 
element is denoted by xi , then the mean is given by Eq. (20.2.1.1).
Mean (µ) = ∑i=
n
i x
N
1 (20.2.1.1)
Mode is the element with the highest number of occurrences.
For example, in a shoe store, the maximum sale may be for shoe with ‘number 7’ 
designation.
Median is the mid-value of a sample space. All the data are arranged in an 
increasing or decreasing order initially. Then, if the number of samples is N.

Standard deviation is a measure of dispersion of the data. It indicates how the data is 
distributed about the mean. The expression for standard deviation of (large) popula￾tion is given by Eq. (20.2.1.2).

Variance is the square of the standard deviation.
Var = σ2 (20.2.1.3)
Note that the above definitions will take slightly different shape when grouped data 
are considered.
The data in a sample space may be random or deterministic. Most of the real data 
are random in nature.374 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
A real-valued function defined on the sample space is called a random variable. 
Mathematically, we can write a random variable (X) as:
X: S→ ℝ, where S is sample space and ℝ is set of real numbers.
Random variable may be discrete random variable or continuous random 
variable.
20.2.1.1 Discrete Random Variable
A random variable that takes on finite or countably infinite number of values is called 
a discrete random variable.
20.2.1.2 Probability Mass Function (PMF)
The function f x( ) is called a probability mass function when
P X x f x k N k k ( = ) = ( ), when = … 1 2, , 3
and P X x f x when x xk ( = ) = ( ) = 0, ≠
where X is a discrete random variable that assumes the values x x x x 1 2 3 N , , ,… .
P (X x = ) stands for probability of X taking the value x.
In general, f x( ) is a PMF if,
(a) f x( )≥ 0 for all x.

20.2.1.4 Continuous Random Variable
A random variable that takes on non-countably infinite number of values is called 
continuous (or non-discrete) random variable.

given by

20.3 STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS
Statistical distribution of data means the way the data are scattered in the sample 
space. Data may be distributed evenly on both sides of the mean; or the data may be 
skewed in one side of the mean value.
20.3.1 Bernoulli Distribution
Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution. Historically, Bernoulli dis￾tribution was the earliest discussed distribution. It deals with the case when there are 
only two possible outcomes of any event (success or failure).
If X is a discrete random variable having only two possible outcomes, such that
X=1, if result of event is a success
X=0, if result of event is a failure.
If p denotes the probability of success of an event, then the probability of 
failure is (1− p).

20.3.2 Binomial Distribution
Binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution involving trials of repetitive 
nature, in which the occurrence (success) or non-occurrence (failure) is of interest. 
Binomial distribution represents the generalized form of Bernoulli trials.
If X is a discrete random variable having only two possible outcomes in ‘N’ number 
of trials, where X can take values 0, 1, 2, 3, … N.
If p denotes the probability of success of an event, then the probability of

20.3.3 Poisson Distribution
Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution where the event is associated 
with a fixed time period and a constant mean value, in which the events occur inde￾pendently without influencing other events.
Let X be a discrete random variable, which can assume the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 … 
such that the PMF of X is given by

20.3.4  Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)
Normal, or Gaussian, distribution is a continuous probability distribution where the 
event is distributed symmetrically about the mean. Many natural phenomena follow 
normal distribution. For example, if you test a large number of specimens in the 
laboratory for its tensile strength or compressive strength, the results will be normally 
distributed.
The functional expression of normal distribution is given by Eq. (20.3.4.1).

monthly or annual) and radioactive decay.

it has probabilities of equal values. An example is random numbers in a large interval.

A lognormal distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable 
in which the logarithm of the variable is normally distributed. Lognormal distribution 
is very much like the normal distribution. It has wide applications in engineering, 
medical sciences and economics.
If Z is a random continuous variable and µ and σ and are two real positive 
numbers, then the distribution of variable X as given by Eq. (20.3.7.1) is called a log￾normal distribution.

20.4 DAMAGE INDEX
Damage Index (DI) is a quantitative measure of damage in a structure. Many damage 
indices have been suggested by researchers of which Park and Ang’s (1985) DI 
(Eq. (20.4.1)) has gained popularity. This DI was modified by Kunnath et al. (1992) 
and this is known as modified DI (Eq. (20.4.4)). The damage indicators are: lateral 
plastic sway, plastic rotation, energy dissipation through hysteresis and strain in 
material. Initial developments considered drift and ductility in the damage and the 
corresponding DI is called non-cumulative DI. When the importance of dissipated 
energy in DI was appreciated and incorporated, it led to what is known as cumula￾tive DI.
Park and Ang (1985) DI is given by Eq. (20.4.1).

where θ m is the maximum rotation of element under seismic condition, θu is the

taken as 0.4, is yield moment, ∫ dE is hysteretic energy per loading cycle.

Each of the DIs given in Eq. (20.4.1) to (20.4.4) is for members only and hence 
are called local damage index. We also have storey damage index (SDI). On the other 
hand, we also have global damage index (GDI). SDI is given by Eq. (20.5.5) and GDI 
is given by Eq. (20.4.6).

0.021 radian and maximum hysteretic energy dissipation as 8 kN-m. Find the damage

Shiradhonkar, 2012) as shown in Table 20.1.
20.5 SEISMIC FRAGILITY ANALYSIS
Seismic fragility analysis involves finding the probability contour of some damage 
state corresponding to the variation of some intensity measure. Some of the terms 
associated with the topic are explained below.386 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
20.5.1  Intensity Measure
In earthquake engineering, intensity measure (IM) stands as a link between probabil￾istic hazard outcome and probabilistic structural response parameters. The structure 
responds differently under different IMs. Common IMs are:
(i) Peak ground acceleration (PGA) of the earthquake
(ii) Peak ground velocity (PGV) of the earthquake
(iii) Peak ground displacement (PGD) of the earthquake
(iv) Spectral acceleration ( Sa) response of the structure
(v) Spectral velocity (Sv ) response of the structure
(vi) Spectral displacement (Sd ) response of the structure
(vii) Predominant period.
20.5.2  Engineering Demand Parameter
Another important term in fragility analysis is the engineering demand parameter 
(EDP). An EDP is a structural response parameter. The normal EDPs are interstorey 
drift ratio (IDR), rotation and plastic rotation of members, deflection, floor acceler￾ation, strain in members and crack width.
While discussing IMs, we need to discuss the engineering demand parameters 
(EDP). ATC 58 defines EDP as “EDPs are structural response quantities that can be 
used to estimate damage to structural and non-structural components and systems”.
Choosing an IM is the choice of the user. An IM may be good or bad depending 
on how it correlates with any structural response. It is said to be good when it can 
correlate with an EDP. The correlation is called a fit. The level of fit (good or bad) can 
be mathematically obtained through regression analysis.
20.5.3  Damage State
Damage state (DS) represents the limit state or damage level of the response param￾eter (EDP) of the structure. For example, damage state of the EDP (IDR) is reported 
TABLE 20.1

in terms of Immediate Occupancy (IO), Life Safety (LS) and Collapse Prevention 
(CP) performance levels.
20.5.4  Incremental Dynamic Analysis
Incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) is a process of getting response of structure over 
increasing levels of hazards, as a plot between some EDP (like IDR, plastic rotation, 
displacement etc.) and IM (like PGA, spectral acceleration etc.). A suite of hazard is 
considered typically 22 pairs of ground motions as prescribed by FEMA P-695. For 
each ground motion, the level is scaled up gradually (say, 0.1g, 0.2g … 1.0g scaling) 
and response of the structure is evaluated. The system goes from linear condition 
to nonlinear condition and finally the collapse occurs. The series of responses are 
plotted in what is called IDA curves. A typical IDA curve between IDR and PGA is 
shown in Figure 20.9.
20.5.5 Seismic Fragility
Seismic fragility is a function of ground motion intensity (more precisely intensity 
measure), which provides probability of failure (or non-failure) for any level of the 
intensity.
Mathematically, fragility is given by Eq. (20.5.5.1):
Fragility = ≥ = =

FIGURE 20.9 Typical IDA curves.388 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
where P stands for probability, D stands for a damage state, C is a quantity describing 
damage state, x is the level of IM and Φ is the standard normal CDF of the distribution.
The right-hand side of Eq. (20.5.5.1) is difficult to solve. As an alternative, the 
following double integral is used to find fragility.

where DV is a decision variable.
20.5.6 Steps in Fragility Analysis
1. Model and design the building in some software.
2. Select the desired EDP (e.g., IDR, plastic rotation), DS of the EDP (e.g., slight 
damage, moderate damage etc.) and intensity measure (e.g., PGA, spectral 
acceleration).
3. Perform incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) on the building using selected 
ground motions.
4. Note down the level of EDP at each level of scaling and draw the IDA curves 
until it reaches the target DS values for each ground motion.
5. Get the intensity measure IMi values at which the building reaches the target 
DS values for each ground motion.
6. Calculate the mean (θ) and standard deviation (β) of the IMi values, when 
using Eqs. (20.5.6.1) and (20.5.6.2).

deviation of lnIM.
A typical fragility function is shown in Figure 20.10.
20.6 BASE ISOLATION SYSTEM
20.6.1  General
Base isolation is the technique to decouple the structure from seismic excitation 
through the application of an isolator at the base of the structure. As a result of base 
isolation, the superstructure does not undergo the same acceleration as that of ground, 
but undergoes much reduced acceleration. Thus, the damage causing vibration in the 
structure is reduced. Base isolation is widely used in bridges and buildings. Base iso￾lation is a costly solution for seismic mitigation. As such, it is used for protecting his￾torical buildings and other structures, whose importance is invaluable. Base isolation 
is also a solution for those buildings which have high post-earthquake importance. 
A hospital is such a building. After an earthquake, injured people rush to hospitals. 
So, a hospital must survive a big earthquake whilst maintaining operational level per￾formance. Similarly, other emergency structures like firefighting stations, buildings 
containing hazardous materials, etc, also may be base isolated. Base isolation has 
been successfully applied in New Zealand, Japan and the United States. Initially steel 
was tried as a material for an isolator. Later on, the advantages of lead in isolators was 
discovered. Lead is a material with high damping characteristics. Thus the lead extru￾sion damper (LED) was developed. In bridges, lead rubber bearing (LRB) was used, 
where the bearing or isolator is made up of lead and rubber put in layers. Natural 
rubber is also used as an isolator. High damping rubber bearing (HRB) is also in use. 
Sliding bearing systems and friction pendulum systems are also isolators.
FIGURE 20.10 Typical fragility curve.390 Performance-Based Seismic Design of Structures
Base isolation makes a stiff building flexible. So, if the building is already flexible, 
base isolation will do no good. Base isolation increases the building period.
For seismic evaluation, at least seven ground motions suggested (ASCE-SEI-41-17).
The isolator carries the vertical load arising out of dead load, live load along with 
any other superimposed dead load. So, the vertical load-carrying capacity of the iso￾lator is to be ascertained. The isolation system is also to take the seismic load in 
addition to gravity load. The seismic load is reversible in nature, so the system is to 
be checked for critical load combination. The isolation should never get disengaged 
from the main structure. Overturning is also a major source of concern in isolated 
system.
20.6.2  Types of Isolation Systems
Base isolation systems can be broadly divided into two categories:
1. Elastomeric bearings
2. Sliding isolators
Elastomeric bearings consist of alternative layers of steel (or lead) and synthetic 
rubbers. Such bearings have long been used in bridges and machines. In the 1960s, 
these were introduced to buildings. It may be noted that in comparison with machines, 
cars and even bridges, the gravity load from building is much higher. So, it was chal￾lenging to introduce bearings in buildings. In elastomeric bearing, the rubber layers 
impart energy dissipation through shear deformation, while the lead layers impart 
rigidity, compression-carrying capacity and prevent bulging of bearing under a strong 
seismic action.
The elastomeric bearings are of three types:
(i) Natural rubber bearing (NRB)
(ii) Synthetic rubber bearings (SRB)
(iii) Lead rubber bearing (LRB)
Sliding plate works on the principle of friction.
An articulated friction isolator is shown in Figure 20.11. Such isolators are 
widely used.

20.7 CLOSURE
Probability is a core idea in seismic analysis and design. Some preliminary ideas 
on probability have been explained in this chapter. Seismic fragility is an important 
study for predicting the damageability of structures under some projected hazard 
level. Fragility analysis requires incremental dynamic analysis. Some discussion has 
been made on base isolation.
