The book contains the basic concepts of signals and systems and is written for
undergraduate engineering students. The topics covered in this book can be taught in
a one-semester course. The reader of this book should have a strong knowledge of
calculus. Integration, differentiation, and summation operations taught in calculus
must be very well known. During the writing of this book, we decided to rewrite
some formulas instead of referring to the page where the formula has been defined.
The main reason for this is that the reader could get distracted by turning away from
the page they are on to read the referred formula. We tried to include as many solved
examples as possible in each chapter of the book. The reader should study and
understand these examples very well.
In Chap. 1, general definitions of signals and systems are provided, and we try to
motivate the reader to the subject. In Chap. 2, definitions of the basic signal functions
used in the literature are laid out. In Chap. 3, energy and power of the signals are
explained. In Chap. 4, we discuss the Fourier analysis of continuous-time signals,
one of the main topics of the book. The topics before Chap. 4 can be considered as
preparatory subjects to the main topics. Fourier analyses of discrete-time signals,
which are digital versions of continuous-time signals, are covered in Chap. 5.
Laplace and Z-transforms, which can be considered as the generalized versions of
Fourier analyses of continuous-time and discrete-time signals, are explained in
Chaps. 6 and 7.
In Chap. 8, the practical applications illustrating the use of discrete Fourier
transform are provided.

Introduction to Signals and Systems
A signal can be defined as a physical phenomenon that carries information. Exam￾ples of signals are human voice, electromagnetic waves, and sonar waves. Any
quantity does not necessarily have to be in a waveform type to be considered as a
signal. For example, Indians in ancient times used smoke to report any danger. The
smoke used here is the signal carrier, and the shape of the smoke contains informa￾tion. To give another example, let us say two persons are sitting in a room and one of
these persons wants to describe an item to the other. For this, he only makes
movements with his hands and tries to describe the item. We can accept the hands
of the person as signal carriers and meaningful movements as signal. However, since
movements containing meaning have to be with the carrier, in this case, we can
accept the person’s hands and the movements of the hands containing meaning as
signal. Even a blink event and a facial expression can be given as an example of a
signal. Signals change over time, and some are defined over a period of time. In order
to show the changes of signals over time, it is necessary to describe them with some
mathematical functions. The mathematical function used describes the changes in
the signal over time and becomes a kind of synonym for the signal. For example, the
mathematical expression
g tð Þ = sin 2ð Þ πft 0≤ t < 1 ð1:1Þ
can be called both a sine function and a sine signal.
In this book, we will use the “signal” word and its corresponding mathematical
function name interchangeably. Electromagnetic waves are one of the most common
types of signals used today. Electromagnetic wave is used to transfer information
from one place to another. The electromagnetic wave is the preferred type of signal
carrier in the world of communication because it spreads with the speed of light and
has the ability to pass through solid objects. Apart from this, laser or infrared signals
are also used in short-distance communication systems.

12 1 Introduction to Signals and Systems
The electromagnetic wave has a sinusoidal graph of change. To send the infor￾mation with this wave, we change the shape of the wave according to the informa￾tion. For each different information, the wave takes a new shape. In this way, the
information-loaded wave acquires the signal feature and is used for communication.
Communication can be of two types which are analog communication and digital
(digital) communication. The communication systems used in the past are based on
analog communication. Today, digital communication systems are mostly preferred.
In analog communication, the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the electromag￾netic wave are changed according to the information wave, and the communication
is performed. In digital communication, the continuous time data wave is first
sampled. In other words, samples are taken from the data wave at certain time
instances within a certain period of time. Each sample is expressed by a real number.
Real numbers are quantized to obtain integers, and their binary equivalents are
calculated. For this purpose, a fixed number of bits can be used, for example, 8 bits.
Later, groups of bits in the binary system are converted into data waves using square
waves, analog modulation is performed, and the resulting wave is transmitted
through an antenna. The steps of digital communication are shown in baseband in
Fig. 1.1.
Human speech can also be given as an example of a signal. The voice of a person
spreads in the atmosphere as sound waves and contains a certain state depending on
the information we want to transmit. The form of the sound wave also changes as we
move from situation to situation. For example, the sound wave produced by a
singing person is different from the sound wave produced by a speaking person.
Another example of a signal is the current and potential difference values
observed in circuits. By tracking voltage or current changes over a quantity, we
gain information about that quantity. For example, the outputs of the devices
connected to the heart to draw the beat graph of the human heart will generate
voltage or current depending on the heart rhythm. We get information about the state
of the heart from the graph of this voltage or current produced over time.

1.1 System
As can be understood from the name of the system, a system refers to a kind of
organization. This organization is created for a purpose. Systems receive data and
produce outputs by processing the data they receive. Systems used in signal
processing are generally electronic circuits. These electronic circuits receive signals
as input data and generate signals as outputs. As an example, the electric circuit
shown in Fig. 1.2 can be considered a system.
In Fig. 1.2, the input of the system is the voltage wave v(t). The output of the
system is the voltage vc(t) on the capacitor. Systems have certain features; we will
examine these features in detail while explaining the system subject. In wireless
communication, the signal is sent via an antenna and received via another antenna.
The signal used in communication is electromagnetic wave. During the communi￾cation process, the data signal passes through many systems. For example, the power
of the signal to be sent from the antenna is increased to higher energies by means of
an amplifier.
An amplifier is nothing but an electronic system. Distortion will occur in the
received signal at the receiving antenna. This distortion is caused by multipath
communication and other factors in the environment, as well as thermal noise caused
by the movement of electrons in the receiving antenna. To improve these distortions,
the signal is passed through an equalizer. Equalizer is another electronic system. It
receives a signal as input and generates another signal as output. All the sub-systems
used in communication can be unified under the name “communication system.”

Basic Signal Functions and Their
Manipulations
Signals are physical quantities and they contain information. The changes of these
physical quantities differ from each other. For example, the heart signals and the
sound signals emitted from a musical instrument will differ from each other in some
ways. Even so, many signals have certain common aspects when they are displayed
graphically. For example, continuity in time can be given as an example of common
aspects. We can generate complex signals through simple signals, just as we can
construct a building using basic components. It is necessary to determine the main
signals. Once we determine the main signals, we can generate more complex signals
from these main signals. The first of the main signals is the sinusoidal signal. The
sinusoidal signal can be obtained using a bipolar magnet and copper wire. The signal
obtained in this way is an electrical signal. It is possible to obtain the DC voltage
signal from the sine voltage signal by means of rectifiers. It is also possible to obtain
square wave, impulse, and very narrow-spaced rectangular (impulse array) wave
sequences by means of electrical circuits. An exponential voltage wave is observed
during the discharge of the capacitor on the resistor. Once we have the fundamental
waves, we can create other more complex waves. We can list the basic signals we use
as follows: unit step signal, unit impulse signal, square wave signal, sinusoidal
signal, exponential decaying signal, complex sine signal, etc.
There are some signals that do not have a smooth trend graph. The value of these
signals at a certain moment of time cannot be calculated. Only a close guess can be
made. These types of signals are called random signals. The amplitude of the signal
received in multipath communication can be given as an example of random signals.
In multipath communication, the amplitude of the received signal does not change
properly depending on time. But the amplitude of the signal fits certain statistical
distributions. This statistical distribution is expressed as a density function. The
amplitude of the received signal in multipath communication is expressed by the
Rayleigh density function if there is no direct line of sight between the transmitter
and the receiver.

6 2 Basic Signal Functions and Their Manipulations
Signals are physical quantities that contain information. For literal expressions
of these physical quantities, we express the signals with mathematical functions.
We can divide the mathematical functions we use into two broad classes,
mathematical functions with continuous variables and mathematical functions with
discrete variables. Continuous variable signal naming can also be used instead of a
continuous variable mathematical function. Similarly, instead of a mathematical
function with a discrete variable, a signal with a discrete variable can be named.
The variable parameter in signals is usually time or frequency.
Considering the time variable, the signals are grouped as either continuous-time
signals or discrete-time signals. To inspect the signals in frequency domain, the
Fourier transforms of the signals are evaluated. Fourier transform can also be called
the spectral function of the signal. This function can be either continuous, discon￾tinuous, or piecewise continuous on the frequency axis. Sometimes a single function
is created that expresses the behavior of the signals in both time and frequency
domains, and the change of the signal in these two planes can be observed with a
single graph. Now, let us see the types of continuous and discontinuous signals.
Then, let us look at how discrete-time signals are obtained by sampling from
continuous-time signals.
2.1 Continuous-Time Signals
In continuous-time signals, the signal has a value for each moment of time, and the
values the signal receives at the time t -
i to t
þ
i are the same. The signal is continuous
for a certain duration of time. The sine signal can be given as an example of
continuous-time signals. Some signals may have discontinuities in certain places
in their graphs. That is, the values of the signal at the time t -
i to t
þ
i may be different.
Such signals are called partial continuous-time signals. Square wave signal can be
considered as a partial continuous signal. A signal can have discontinuity points in
its graph, but this may not be sufficient for the signal to be called as discrete-time
signal. Continuous-time and partial continuous-time signals are shown in Figs. 2.1
and 2.2.
Mathematical functions can be used for the representation of these signals, for
example, the sine signal in Fig. 2.1 can be mathematically expressed as
f tð Þ = sin 50 ð Þ πt 0  t  0:1 ð2:1Þ
On the other hand, the pulse train signal shown in Fig. 2.2 must either be written
in terms of known functions, or only one period of this periodic signal can be written
mathematically. One period of wave in Fig. 2.2 can be written as
k tð Þ = 1 0  t < 0:017
- 1 0:017 < t  0:034 ð2:2ÞFig. 2.1 Continuous-time sine function
Fig. 2.2 Rectangle waveform8 2 Basic Signal Functions and Their Manipulations
2.2 Discrete-Time Signals
Discrete-time signals acquire values at certain moments of time. They do not take
any value in the interval between two successive moments of time. Other synony￾mous expressions used for discrete-time signals can be listed as discrete-time
function, discrete-time signal function. If the discrete-time signal is expressed as a
mathematical sequence, it should be specified which of the elements in this mathe￾matical sequence indicates the start time. Discrete-time signals are obtained from
continuous-time signals via sampling operation. The continuous-time triangle signal
and its sampling operation are shown in Figs. 2.3 and 2.4.
Discrete-time signals can be displayed graphically or expressed mathematically.
Digital signals are similar to discrete-time signals; however, in discrete-time signals,
the time axis includes time information. Digital signals on the other hand are
mathematical sequences, and time information is not explicitly available on the
graphs of the signals. In digital signals, indices of the elements are considered
time values. Some authors tend to use the discrete-time signal term as the digital
signal.

10 2 Basic Signal Functions and Their Manipulations
2.3 Manipulation of Signals
2.3.1 Manipulation of Continuous-Time Signals
New signals are obtained by shifting a signal in the time domain and changing its
amplitude or taking its symmetry with respect to the time axis. These operations can
also be explained mathematically. Let us first examine the processing of continuous￾time signals and then consider the processing of digital signals.
1. The graph of the function f(t - a) can be obtained by shifting the graph of f(t) to
the right, if a > 0, and to the left, if a < 0, by |a| units.
2. The graph of the function f(bt) is obtained by dividing the time axis of the graph
of the function f(t) by b.
3. The graph of the cf(t) function is obtained by multiplying the amplitude of the
graph of the function f(t) by c.
There is also a combined situation of these three cases, let us explain it as follows:
4. To plot the graph of the cf(bt - a) function, first the graph of the f(t - a) function
is drawn, then the time axis of this graph is divided by b, and the amplitudes of
the obtained signal are multiplied by c.
Example 2.2 Plot the graph of the function g (t) = - 2f(2t + 3) obtained from the
function f(t) whose graph is given in Fig. 2.6.
Solution 2.2 To graph the function g(t) = - 2f(2t + 3) let us first graph the function
f(t + 3) then f(2t + 3), and finally the function -2f(2t + 3). The graph of the function
f(t + 3) is obtained by shifting the graph of the function f(t) by 3 units to the left on
the time axis as explained in Fig. 2.7.
The graph of the function f(2t + 3) is obtained by dividing the time axis of the
graph of the function f(t + 3) by 2. This operation is explained in Fig. 2.8.
The graph of the function -2f(2t + 3) is obtained by multiplying the amplitudes
in the graph of the function f(2t + 3) by -2 as illustrated in Fig. 2.9.

Sometimes the mathematical expression of the processed signal is given as

 . To plot the signal c0
f t - a0
b0
  first the time axis of the graph of the f(t) is
multiplied by b′ then the resulting graph is shifted to the right by a′ (if a′ > 0) or to
the left by a′ (if a′ < 0), and finally the amplitude is multiplied by c′.
The more general form of c0
f t - a0
b0 is written as c0

be drawn as in Fig. 2.18.16 2 Basic Signal Functions and Their Manipulations

Let the period of f(t) be T, i.e. f(t) = f(t + T) The period of the function g(t) = cf(at + b)
equals to
T
a :
To draw the graph of g(t), we first draw the graph of go(t) = cfo(at + b) where fo(t)
is the one period of f(t). Next, shifting the graphs of go(t) by k T

2.3.2 Manipulation of Digital Signals
By shifting and scaling the digital signal f[n], we can get g[n] = af[bn - c]. To get af
[bn - c], we perform the steps:
1. First, shifting f[n] on the time axis by |c|, to the right or to the left (if c > 0, to the
right, if c < 0, to the left), we get the graph of f[n - c].
2. In the second step, the time axis of f[n - c] is divided by b, and from those
division results, only the integer division results are kept, the others are discarded,
and in this way, we obtain the graph of f[bn - c].
3. In the last step, the amplitudes of f[bn - c], are multiplied by a, and the graph of
af[bn - c] is obtained.
Example 2.7 The graph of f[n] is depicted in Fig. 2.23. Draw the graph of
- 2f ½  2n - 3 2:7Þ
Solution 2.7 First, let us draw the signal f[n - 3] by shifting the graph of f[n] to the
right by 3 units on the time axis as illustrated in Fig. 2.24.
Next, by dividing the time axis of f[n - 3] by 2 and omitting the non-integer
division results, we obtain the graph of f[2n - 3] as shown in Fig. 2.25.
In the last step, multiplying the amplitudes of f[2n - 3] by -2, we obtain the
graph of -2f[2n - 3] as shown in Fig. 2.26.
It is also possible to write the result we obtained in the form of an integer
sequence. We can write the result as an integer sequence as in2.3 Manipulation of Signals 19

2.4 Sampling
The sampling of continuous-time signals constitutes the basis of digital communi￾cation. Sampling is the process of taking samples from a continuous-time signal at
certain fixed time intervals. Instead of transmitting the continuous-time signal, we
can transmit the samples taken from the continuous-time signal assuming that the
sufficient number of samples is taken from the continuous-time signal such that the
sample array conveys sufficient information about the continuous-time signal.
We need to collect enough samples. Sending too many samples also means
wasting time, wasting energy, and running electronic circuits more than needed.
In this section, we will provide brief information about the sampling operation.
Let f(t), t 2 R be a continuous-time signal. Taking samples from f(t) at n 2 Z, Ts 2 R,
nTs time instants, let us form the mathematical sequence f[n] which is a digital
signal. The sampling operation can be explained by the mathematical expression
f n½  = f nT ð Þs , n 2 Z, Ts 2 R ð2:9Þ
where Ts is the sampling period, and its inverse Fs = 1
Ts
is called sampling frequency.
Sampling of the continuous-time signal f(t) is illustrated in Fig. 2.27. For the
sampling operation, the sampling period is chosen as Ts = 0.5 ms. As it is seen from
Fig. 2.27 that samples are taken from continuous-time signal at time instants which
are multiples of Ts, i.e., samples are taken according to, f[n] = f(nTS), n 2 Z, Ts 2 R.
Using the taken samples, the mathematical sequence f[n] is formed.
The digital signal, i.e., mathematical sequence, f[n] obtained by sampling oper￾ation can be written as

which contains infinitely many numbers.
If we do the sampling operation for a certain time interval, there will be a finite
number of elements in our sequence. The digital signal f[n] obtained in Fig. 2.27 can
be drawn w.r.t its time index n as in Fig. 2.28.
The samples are sent by the transmitter. On the receiver side, the samples got are
used to generate the continuous-time signal sent. This operation is illustrated in
Fig. 2.29. As can be seen from the graph in Fig. 2.29, the more samples sent by the
transmitter, the more the signal reconstructed at the receiver side will resemble the
analog signal at the transmitter side.
On the other hand, by using a certain number of samples, it is possible to
re-generate the continuous-time signal at the receiver side exactly. The minimum
number of samples that should be taken from the continuous-time signal per second
for the perfect recovery of the analog signal at the transmitter side should be greater
than two times of the highest frequency available in the spectrum of the low-pass
continuous-time signal. This is known as the Nyquist criteria in the literature.
Sampling frequency can be interpreted as the number of samples taken from
continuous-time signals per second. The sampling frequency should be greater than
two times of the highest frequency available in the spectrum of the low-pass signal.2.5 Basic Signals Used in Communication and Signal Processing 23
For example, if the sampling frequency is Fs = 1000 Hz, it means that we get
1000 samples from a continuous-time signal in 1 second. Since we take a thousand
samples in 1 second, the time interval between two samples is Ts = 1
1000 sec, which is
equal to 1 ms.
Note that 1
Hz = sec . We must take a sufficient number of samples from the
continuous-time signal in order to make the communication at the lowest satisfactory
level. To determine the number of samples to be taken from continuous-time signal,
we can use the Nyquist criteria. Let us try to explain the Nyquist sampling criterion
with an example.
Example 2.9 Assume that the continuous-time signal
f tð Þ = sin 200 ð Þþ πt cos 850 ð Þ πt ð2:10Þ
is to be sampled. Determine the minimum sampling frequency such that the perfect
reconstruction of the continuous-time signal is possible from its samples.
Solution 2.9 Let us determine the largest frequency within f(t) and choose the
sampling frequency as twice the largest frequency. The frequencies of the sinusoidal
signals in f(t) can be found by comparing these signals to the mathematical expres￾sions sin(2πft) and cos(2πft).
In this case, the frequencies in f(t) are found as 200
2 = 100 Hz and 850
2 = 425 Hz.
So, the constraint for the sampling frequency can be written as
Fs > 2 × 425 → Fs > 850
by which we can determine the sampling frequency as 851. That is, during the digital
transmission, at least 851 samples must be sent in 1 second. If we send less than
851 samples per second, the reconstructed signal at the receiver will be different
from the f(t).
2.5 Basic Signals Used in Communication and Signal
Processing
2.5.1 Representation of Signals with Mathematical Functions
The signal takes values that change over time, and if we draw these values over time,
we get a graph of the change of the signal over time. The time changes of the signals
can be expressed with mathematical functions. New functions can be obtained by the
manipulation of mathematical functions. In other words, functions of functions can
be defined, that is, new signals can be generated by processing other signals. In this
section, we explain basic continuous and digital signals and see how to create more
complex signals from these basic signals.24 2 Basic Signal Functions and Their Manipulations

where for the first definition the value of u(t) for t = 0 is not given. The advantage of
the second definition is that we can write the equality
u tðÞþ uð Þ - t = 1
which cannot be written using the first definition in (2.11). The graphs of the unit
step function for both definitions are given in Fig. 2.30.

indicates the total area under the impulse function. The impulse function can beR

The impulse function is one of the basic functions widely used in communication
and signal processing. In this respect, some basic properties of the impulse function
should be well understood.
Properties of the impulse function can be listed as follows:
26 2 Basic Signal Functions and Their Manipulations
1. δ(t - t0)f(t) = δ(t - t0)f(t0), where t0 is a real number and t represents the time
parameter.
2. δ(t - t0)f(t - t1) = δ(t - t0)f(t0 - t1) is the more general form of (1).

- δ t - t0 dt = 1.

5. 1
- δ t - t0 f t dt = f t0 or 1
- δ t - t0 f t - t1 dt = f t0 - t1 .
The proof of (5) can be achieved using (1), (2), and (3). Now let us prove (5) as an
exercise.

Solution 2.12 To draw the graph of f(t) = u(t - 1) - u(t - 3) + δ(t - 2), we first
draw the graph of u(t - 1) - u(t - 3), and then adding the graph of the shifted
impulse δ(t - 2), we get the graph of f(t) as in Fig. 2.35.

the ramp and unit step functions.
Solution 2.13 The graphs of r(t - 1) and -r(t - 2) are shown in Fig. 2.37.
The slopes of the shifted ramp functions depicted in Fig. 2.37 are 1 and -1,
respectively. If the functions shown in Fig. 2.37 are summed, we obtain the function
shown in Fig. 2.38 where it is seen that after t = 2, we have a horizontal line with
slope 0.
It is seen from Fig. 2.38 that from the time instant t = 2 on, the amplitude of the
function value is 1, whereas, in f(t) depicted in Fig. 2.36, the amplitude value is
0 from the time instant t = 2 on.
In order to make the amplitude 0 from the time instant t = 2 on, it is necessary to
add function -u(t - 2) to the function in Fig. 2.38. This operation is explained in
Fig. 2.39.

the amount of discontinuity at the discontinuity points:

Solution 2.19 First, let us express the graphs mathematically in terms of the ramp
and the unit step functions. Then, we can take the derivation of the mathematical
expressions. In fact, it is possible to draw the graphs of the derived functions from
the graphs of the original functions without writing mathematical expressions. In our
next example, we get the results directly using the graphs without writing mathe￾matical expressions. The mathematical expressions of the graphs in Fig. 2.44 can be
written as follows:

The graphs of the derived functions can be drawn as in Fig. 2.45.
If we inspect the derivative graphs, we see that the impulse function appears at
time instants ‘
t
’ where the original function, whose derivative is taken, has discon￾tinuities. To plot the graph of the derivative function, we can consider the two
drawing rules as follows:2.5 Basic Signals Used in Communication and Signal Processing 35

Fig. 2.46 Function graphs for Example 2.20
Rule 1 We determine the discontinuity points, and calculate the amount of ampli￾tude differences at the discontinuity points. If there is an upward jump at the
discontinuity point, an impulse function with an amplitude equal to the amount of
amplitude difference at the discontinuity point appears in the derivative graph. If the
discontinuity is downward, a downward impulse function, whose amplitude equals
to the amplitude difference, appears in the derivative graph at the discontinuity point.
Rule 2 If there are sloping lines in the graph to be derived, the slope amounts are
calculated and indicated on the graph as horizontal lines.
Example 2.20 Calculate the derivatives of the functions given in Fig. 2.46 directly
using the graph without writing a formula.
Solution 2.20 Let us find the derivatives of the graphics directly by applying only
rule 1 and rule 2 without writing formulas for the graphics. For this purpose, we
should determine the discontinuity points on the graphs and calculate the amount ofamplitude differences at the discontinuity points, and draw downward impulses with
amplitudes equal to downward discontinuity amounts and upward impulses with
amplitudes equal to upward discontinuity amounts.

We can manipulate some mathematical expressions in an easier manner if these
mathematical expressions are written in terms of unit step and impulse functions.

So, in order to plot the function _

discontinuity points of the delta impulse function given in Fig. 2.48, the graph of the
derivative of the delta impulse function _
δΔ t can be drawn as in Fig. 2.49.
The amplitudes of the impulse functions in Fig. 2.49 are 1
Δ and - 1
Δ. That is, the
areas under the impulse functions are 1
Δ and - 1
Δ.
If we replace the impulse functions in Fig. 2.49 with the rectangles whose limits
give the impulses in Fig. 2.49, we get the signals in Fig. 2.50.
Taking into account the area values of the impulse functions 1
Δ and - 1
Δ , the
amplitude values of the rectangles are calculated as 1
Δ2 and - 1
Δ2 in Fig. 2.50. If we
compare Figs. 2.48 and 2.50, we see that both amplitudes of _
δΔð Þt and δΔ(t) go to 1
as Δ goes to zero; however, the amplitudes of _
δΔð Þt go to infinity faster than the
amplitudes of δΔ(t).2.5 Basic Signals Used in Communication and Signal Processing 39

In Fig. 2.53, the graph of the function resulting from the summation of impulse
function and g(t) is depicted. It is seen from Fig. 2.53 that, as δ → 0, we obtain the
impulse function shifted along the vertical axis.
Exercise The graph of the impulse function shifted along the vertical and horizontal
axes is given in Fig. 2.54. Comment on this function.
Example 2.27 In Fig. 2.55, the summation of the impulse function and the rectan￾gular function is depicted. Comment on this graph.
Solution 2.27 The amplitude of r(t) is 1. The area under the impulse function is 1 as
well. The impulse function can be considered as a rectangle, having a very small
width and very large height, with an area equal to 1. On the other hand, the area of
the impulse function equals the difference of the vertical ordinates.
Summing a function by a number means shifting the graph of the function upward
or downward along the vertical axis. So, if we consider Fig. 2.55, the value of the
rectangle at time t = 2 is r(t = 2) = 1, and this value is summed with the impulse
function. Then we can shift the graph of the impulse function upward by 1 as
depicted in Fig. 2.56.

We used the rectangle’s value at t = 2, r(t = 2) = 1, to shift the impulse function
up. So if we subtract this point from the rectangle function, the rectangle will look as
if it is divided into two parts, that is, the rectangle becomes as in Fig. 2.57.
where we have r(2-) = 1, r(2+) = 1 and r(2) = 0. The graphic in Fig. 2.57 is
exaggerated. It can be drawn as in Fig. 2.58 where a single missing point is indicated
by a circle.
Finally, if we sum up the graph of the shifted impulse function and the graph in
Fig. 2.58, we obtain Fig. 2.59.
Example 2.28 The graph of f(t) is depicted in Fig. 2.60. Draw the graph of
g(t) = f(t) + f(t - 2).
Solution 2.28 Looking at the graph of the function f(t), it is seen that the values of
the function at t = - 1 and t = 1 are f(-1) = - 1 and f(1) = 2. Vertical lines are
used at the time instants t = - 1 and t = 1 where the function gets values 1 and 2. It
is possible to draw the function in Fig. 2.60 as in Fig. 2.61.
In Fig. 2.61, we specifically highlighted the values at the extreme points with bold
black dots. Fig. 2.61 can also be drawn as in Fig. 2.62 without using black dots at the
end of the lines.42 2 Basic Signal Functions and Their Manipulations

If the function does not have value at t = - 1 and t = 1, then its graph is drawn as
in Fig. 2.63.
Let us now draw the graph of g(t) = f(t) + f(t - 2). To draw the graph of the
function f(t - 2), it is sufficient to shift the values of the function f(t) by 2 units to the
right along the time axis. The graphs of f(t) and f(t - 2) are shown in Fig. 2.64.
It is seen from Fig. 2.64 that the functions f(t) and f(t + 2) overlap only at the point
t = 1. There are no other overlapping points. Thus, the value of g(t) at point t = 1 can
be calculated as g(1) = 1 + 2. Accordingly, the graph of g(t) can be drawn as in
Fig. 2.65.
The graph in Fig. 2.65 can also be drawn as in Fig. 2.66.
Example 2.29 The graph of f(t) is shown in Fig. 2.67. Draw the graph of
g(t) = f(t - 1) + f(t) + f(t + 1).2.5 Basic Signals Used in Communication and Signal Processing 43

344 2 Basic Signal Functions and Their Manipulations
Solution 2.29 The function g(t) contains f(t - 1), f(t) and f(t + 1) whose graphs are
depicted in Fig. 2.68.
For the addition of the functions shown in Fig. 2.68, we first need to determine the
overlapping lines and write the equations of these lines. The overlapping lines are
shown in Fig. 2.69.
The equations of the overlapping lines are indicated in Fig. 2.70.
On the left side of Fig. 2.70, the equations of the overlapping lines are t + 1
and -t in the interval they are defined, and adding these two equations, we get
t + 1 - t = 1. Similarly, if the equations of the two lines that overlap on the right side
of Fig. 2.70 are added, we get t + (-t + 1) = 1.
Thus, we can draw the graph of g(t) as in Fig. 2.71.

First, let us draw the graph of X w
6
 . Shifting the graph of X w
6
  to the right by 2π, we
obtain the graph of X w - 2π
6
 , and shifting the graph of X w
6
  to the left by 2π, we get
the graph of X wþ2π
6
 .
Accordingly, the graph of Y(w) can be obtained by summing all the shifted graphs
and the central one as depicted in Fig. 2.80.
The summation of the graphs in Fig. 2.80 may seem difficult at first glance.
However, when we inspect Fig. 2.80, we see that a certain unit is repeated through￾out the shape. The repeating unit is shown in bold in Fig. 2.81.
We first sum the equations of the crossing lines in Fig. 2.81. Since the slopes of
these lines are of equal and opposite signs, the result of the sum will be a fixednumber. In Fig. 2.81, around the center, the equation of the diagonal line with a
positive slope is

and the line with a negative slope has the equation

The sum of the equations is

3 - w

3 = 2
3 :
In other words, when the equations of the crossing lines around the center are
summed, we get the graph in Fig. 2.82.
Finally, when the triangle and the horizontal line equations in Fig. 2.82 are
summed, we obtain Fig. 2.83.
To obtain the graph of Y(w), we shift the graph in Fig. 2.83 to the right and left by
multiples of 2πand sum the shifted replicas with the centered graph. The result of the
summation is depicted in Fig. 2.84.

T is the frequency of the function (signal),
and the parameter θ indicates the phase difference. The angular frequency is defined
as w = 2π

sinusoidal function as f(t) = K cos (wt + θ).52 2 Basic Signal Functions and Their Manipulations

Unit Impulse Function
Digital unit impulse function is defined as

We can also write

The graph of (2.30) is depicted in Fig. 2.90.
The relationship between the unit step function and the unit impulse function can
be written as

or as

Solution 2.24 The graphs of u[n - 3], u[n - 9] and f[n] are shown in Figs. 2.92 and
2.93, respectively.
As it is seen from Fig. 2.93 when the subtraction u[n - 3] - u[n - 9] is
performed, overlapping parts cancel each other, and zero is produced. The function
f[n] is a rectangle between points 3 and 8.
Example 2.25 Draw the graph of f[n] = u[n] - 2u[n - 6] + u[n - 11].
Solution 2.25 When the terms in f[n] are inspected, it is seen that for n  6 the
function -2u[n - 6] is added to the unit step function u[n], and this results in the
amplitude value being equal to -1. For n  11, the function u[n - 11] is further
added to the previous summation, and this results in 0 amplitude value. The graph of

Example 2.27 Write the function shown in Fig. 2.96 in terms of the unit step
functions.
Solution 2.27 First, let us identify the points where the function changes, and then
considering these points, let us write the function as the sum of unit step functions. If
we inspect the given function, we see that at points n = 1, n = 3 and n = 6 the
amplitude of the function changes. Considering the function amplitude changes for
n = 1 and n = 3, we can write the function for 1  n  5 as u[n - 1] - 2u[n - 3] as
explained in Fig. 2.97.
Since the function has 0 value after n = 6, we can add the shifted function
u[n - 6] to the previous summation to achieve this goal as illustrated in Fig. 2.98.
Thus, f[n] can be written as f[n] = u[n - 1] - 2u[n - 3] + u[n - 6].

In this section, we will explain how some basic signal functions are produced with
electronic circuits, and we will give sample circuit diagrams to explain the subject.
Passive circuit elements are used to generate analog signals. Passive circuit elements
consist of resistor, capacitor, and inductor, respectively. Basic signal functions can
be generated using passive circuit elements as well as voltage or current sources. If
we recall the basic signal functions, they were unit step signal, unit impulse signal,
ramp signal, exponential signal, and sinusoidal signal.
2.6.1 Passive Circuit Elements
Inductor
An inductor is a passive circuit element used to store current, i.e., to store magnetic
energy. The current value across the inductor does not show sudden changes;
instead, it gradually decreases or increases (Fig. 2.100).
The relation between the current and the voltage on the inductor can be expressed
using
v tð Þ = L di tð Þ
dt → i tð Þ = 1

vð Þτ dτ ð2:41Þ
Capacitor
A capacitor is one of the passive circuit elements used to store energy like an
inductor. Voltage is stored on the capacitor, and voltage variations across the
capacitor are not abrupt; voltage on a capacitor increases or decreases exponentially
(Fig. 2.101).

Resistor
The resistor is one of the passive circuit elements used to dissipate energy into the
environment as heat and light. A resistor is not used for energy storage. As we
mentioned earlier, inductors and capacitors are used to store energy. On the other
hand, since these circuit elements have internal resistance, their stored energy is
discharged as heat and light through the internal resistance (Fig. 2.102).
The value of the resistance can change depending on time, or it can be constant.
The voltage-current relationship of the time-invariant resistor R is as
v tð Þ = Rið Þt ð2:43Þ
Now let us see how basic signals, i.e., unit step signal, impulse signal, sinusoidal
signal, and exponential signal, are generated using passive circuit elements.2.6 Electronic Circuits Used in Signal Generation 63

Unit Step Function
The unit step function u(t) takes values for t  0; the operation of the unit step
function can be considered as closing the switch in a circuit, and the unit step
function can be used instead of a switch as illustrated in Fig. 2.103.
Impulse Function
To generate the impulse function δ(t), we can use the circuit in Fig. 2.104.
After the switch is closed, the voltage on the capacitor becomes v0u(t), from
which we calculate the current on the capacitor as
i tð Þ = C dv tð Þ
dt → i tð Þ = C dv0u tð Þ
dt → i tð Þ = Cv0
du tð Þ
dt → i tð Þ = Cv0δðÞ ð t 2:44Þ
The current expression i(t) = Cv0δ(t) includes the impulse function.
Sinusoidal Function
To generate a sinusoidal function, a capacitor with an initial voltage value of V0 and
an inductor is connected in parallel as shown in Fig. 2.105. After the switch is closed,
assuming that the inductor and capacitor have no internal resistances, the voltage
across the capacitor and the inductor will have sinusoidal characteristic.64 2 Basic Signal Functions and Their Manipulations

2.6.2 Exponential Function
The circuit in Fig. 2.106 can be used to generate the exponential function. In this
circuit, a resistor is connected in series to the capacitor with an instantaneous voltage
value V0, and the switch is closed at t = 0. In this case, the voltage across the
capacitor is discharged exponentially over the resistor. The voltage expression on the
capacitor can be written as
v tð Þ = V0e - t
RC ð2:48Þ
where RC is called the time constant of the circuit.
2.6.3 Exponentially Damped Sinusoidal Function
The circuit to generate the exponentially damped sine function is depicted in
Fig. 2.107.
As it is seen from Fig. 2.107, an exponentially damped sine signal can be obtained
from the circuit which is constructed by connecting the passive circuit elements,
resistor, inductor, and capacitor in parallel. The instantaneous voltage value of the
capacitor is V0. If Kirchhoff’s current law is applied after the switch is closed, we get66 2 Basic Signal Functions and Their Manipulations

2.6.4 Linear and Time-Invariant Systems
The circuit shown in Fig. 2.108 can be given as an example of a linear time-invariant
system. In this circuit, the system input is the voltage source v(t), and the system
output is the current i(t).2.6 Electronic Circuits Used in Signal Generation 67

system for the input v(t - t0) and examine whether the output is equal to i(t - t0)
or not.
The system output for the input signal v(t - t0) can be calculated as

The relationship between the input and output of a linear and time-invariant system
can be represented by differential or difference equations. The circuit in Fig. 2.109
can be given as an example of a linear and time-invariant system. In this circuit, v(t)
is the system input and i(t) is the system output.

Energy, Power, Convolution, and Systems
In this chapter, we will first deal with the calculation of energy and power of signals.
The signals that we will discuss in this chapter are deterministic signals, and they do
not have random characteristics. The calculation of power expressions of random
signals is beyond the scope of this book. Knowing the energy and power of a signal
is an important issue in communication. In particular, many performance criteria are
based on the signal power-to-noise power ratio at the receiver. Energy is the total
power dissipated by a signal in a given time interval. The power of a signal can be
considered as the amount of energy dissipated per unit of time. We can perceive and
measure energy as heat and light as it transforms from one form to another. For some
signals, the power calculations can be performed, but their energies cannot be
calculated, whereas for some other signals, the energies can be calculated, but
powers cannot be calculated. In the following sections, we will give examples of
these signals and group these signals under different names. Energy and power
calculations can be done both in the time domain and in the frequency domain. For
some signals, energy calculations can be difficult in the time domain, whereas
energy or power calculations in the frequency domain can be made more easily. In
this section, we will calculate energy and power only in the time domain. We will
consider energy and power calculations in the frequency domain after we study the
Fourier transform topic.
The second topic we will study in this chapter is the convolution of signals.
Systems can be regarded as electronic circuits that process signals and generate new
signals from them. Some systems are described mathematically. We cannot say that
every mathematically defined system has a physical counterpart. Some mathematical
definitions remain only theoretical; they cannot be applied in practice. In order for
the mathematically defined systems to be applied in practice, these systems must
have some properties. One of these properties is causality. Another important
property is stability. Unstable systems are not preferred in practical applications.
During the theoretical design of any system, attention should be paid to its stability.
Another property of a system is memory. While for some systems having memory
can be a critical requirement, for others not having memory can be an important

where T is the period of x(t) such that x(t) = x(t + T). For periodic signals, root￾mean-square is defined as
criterion. Linearity and time invariance are the remaining properties that systems can
have. Since it is easier to process linear and time-invariant systems, it is preferred
that the systems we design are linear and time-invariant. If the impulse responses of
linear and time-invariant systems are known, the output of the system for any
random input can be calculated by the convolution operation.

Hence, we see that the instantaneous and average power of the unit step function
can be calculated, but the energy of the signal is infinite, which can be understood
from the graph of the unit step function. Since the unit step function is a rectangle
with amplitude “1” going to infinity on the positive axis, its square is the same, and
the area under its square is infinite. On the other hand, since the amplitude remains
the same, the instantaneous power and the average power are constant numbers.
Signals whose energies cannot be calculated, but whose powers can be calculated,
are called power signals. On the other hand, signals whose powers cannot be
calculated, but whose energies can be calculated, are called energy signals.

The signal does not have average power; however, it has finite energy. We call
such signals energy signals.
Note In this book, when the signal power is mentioned, we will assume that the
average power of the signal is considered, not instantaneous power unless otherwise
indicated.

from which it is seen that the average power of the sine signal is equal to half of the
square of its maximum amplitude.

3.2 Convolution
Convolution should be learned very well because it is a subject that we will
encounter frequently in signal processing and communication. We will first deal
with finding the convolutions of continuous signals and then the convolutions of
discrete signals. Before starting to study the topic of convolution, we advise the
reader to read the definitions and properties of continuous and discrete signals from
the relevant chapters of the book.
3.2.1 Convolution of Continuous-Time Signals
Let f(t) and g(t) be two continuous-time functions.
The convolution of these two functions is indicated as f(t)  g(t), and the
convolution is defined as
h tð Þ = f tð Þ  g tð Þ
=
Z1
- 1
fð Þτ g tð Þ - τ dτ ð3:11Þ
where the parameter τ disappears after the evaluation of the integral. Any letter can
also be used for the place of τ. To calculate the convolution of two functions,
sometimes mathematical methods are easier to deal with, and at other times, graph￾ical calculations can be easier as well. We can decide which method we should use
by inspecting the question and using our own experience.3.2 Convolution 81
Example 3.5 Calculate h(t) = f(t)  f(t) where f(t) = u(t).
Solution 3.5-(1) The convolution operation can be calculated as
h tð Þ = f tðÞ f tð Þ
=
Z1
- 1
fð Þτ f tð Þ - τ dτ
=
Z1
- 1
uð Þτ u tð Þ - τ dτ
where writing u(τ) and u(t - τ) as
uð Þτ = 1 τ  0
0 otherwise 
u tð Þ - τ = 1 t - τ  0, → t  τ
0 otherwise 
we get
uð Þτ u tð Þ - τ = 1 t  τ  0
0 otherwise 
which is the integrand expression and the integral is evaluated as
h tð Þ =
Zt
0
1 × 1dτ t  0
= t t  0
which is a ramp function, i.e., h(t) = tu(t) → r(t). Thus, the convolution of the two
unit step functions gives us the ramp function. That is, we have
u tðÞ u tð Þ = r tð Þ ð3:12Þ
Solution 3.5-(2) Now, let us solve the same question graphically without using a
mathematical approach.
First, let us draw the graphs of the functions u(τ) and u(t - τ). Then, let us find
their product, and calculate the integral of the product.
The graphs of u(τ), u(t - τ), and u(τ)u(t - τ) are depicted in Fig. 3.1. It is seen
from Fig. 3.1 that the total area under u(τ)u(t - τ) is t. 1 = t which is the integral of
u(τ)u(t - τ) over the interval [0 t]. Hence, we can write that
u tð Þ  u tð Þ = t, t > 082 3 Energy, Power, Convolution, and Systems

Fig. 3.1 Graphs of u(τ), u(-τ), u(t - τ) and u(τ)u(t - τ)
When we inspect the graph of u(τ)u(t - τ), we see that the total area under u(τ)
u(t - τ) depends on t. As the value of t increases, the area of the rectangle increases.
Property Convolution is commutative, that is, the convolution of f(t) and g(t) can
be calculated using either f(t)  g(t) or g(t)  f(t), i.e., we have
f tðÞ g tð Þ = g tðÞ f tð Þ
Proof The convolution of two functions is calculated as
h tð Þ = f tðÞ g tð Þ
=
Z1

fð Þτ g tð Þ - τ dτ
where making use of the parameter change as

Example 3.6 Find the convolution of two functions whose graphs are depicted in
Fig. 3.2.
Solution 3.6 We can express the functions shown in Fig. 3.2 in terms of unit step
functions and calculate the convolution algebraically.
In order to find the convolution, we can write the functions in terms of unit step
functions and calculate the convolution mathematically. The method we will follow
will be the graphical approach method. We should decide whether we use g(t)  f(t)
or f(t)  g(t). In fact, we should choose the one which is easier to calculate. For some
problems, the graphical calculation of f(t)  g(t) may be much simpler than g(t)  f(t)
and vice versa, even though there is not much difference between the two for this
question.

overlapping parts of the g(τ) and f(t - τ) change according to the variable t.
Considering the different intervals used for t in Fig. 3.3 and integration results, we
can write the convolution result as in

g tð Þ = u tð Þ þ 1 - 2u tð Þþ - 1 u tð Þþ - 2 u tð Þ - 3
Now we can calculate the convolution. Using the distributive property of the
convolution, we can write

3.2.2 Impulse Function and Convolution
A frequently used function in convolution is the impulse function. The impulse
function can be defined as

3.2.3 Convolution of Digital Signals
Digital signals are discrete-time signals. Every digital signal is a discrete-time signal,
but the reverse is not true. For instance, the signal
f tð Þ = δð Þþ t - 1 δð Þ t þ 1
is a discrete-time signal, but it is not a digital signal. On the other hand, the signal
f n½  = δ½ þ n - 1 δ½  n þ 1
is a discrete signal in time, and it is also a digital signal.
Discrete signals are represented as a sequence of numbers. Each number in the
sequence represents the amplitude of the signal at a point in time. The time axis
values increase one by one. It is critical to know the moment of time zero at the time
axis for reference.
In Fig. 3.9, the graph of a discrete-time signal, a digital signal, is given.

of the reference point increase one by one.
3.2.4 Convolution of Digital Signals

is calculated as
h n½  = f n½  g n½ 
= X1
k = -1
f k½ g n½  - k ð3:20Þ
As with continuous-time signals, the convolutional operator has the properties of
commutative, linearity, and distribution for digital signals. That is, we can write

Now let us see how to calculate the convolution using the visual method.
First, f[k], g[-k] signals are drawn. Then, g[n - k] signals are obtained by
shifting the g[-k] signal for different n values. By finding the overlapping values
of g[n - k] and f[k], and multiplying them and summing the multiplication results, h
[n] values are found.
The graphical solution is illustrated in Fig. 3.12. In this solution, we divide
the horizontal axis of the g[k] graph by -1 to get the graph of g[-k]. The graph of
g[n - k] for negative n values is obtained by shifting the graph of g[-k] to the left by
|n| units, and in a similar manner, the graph of g[n - k] for positive n values is
obtained by shifting the graph of g[-k] to the right by |n| units.

equals L = L1 + L2.

k = - 1
f k½ g n½  - k
or
f n½  g n½  = X1
k = - 1
g k½ f n½  - k
We will use the second expression, i.e., 1
k = - 1g k½ f n½  - k , for the calculation
of the convolution. If we expand the summation in
f n½  g n½  = X1
k = - 1
g k½ f n½  - k
we obtain
f n½  g n½  = ⋯ þ g½  - 1 f n½ þ þ 1 g½  0 f n½ þ g½  1 f n½ þ - 1 ⋯
where substituting the values of g[n], we get
f n½  g n½  = - 1f n½ þ 2f n½ þ - 1 1f n½  - 2
To get f[n - 1] in vector form, it is sufficient to shift the index pointer for n = 0 in
f[n] to the left by “1” unit. In a similar manner, to get f[n - 2] in a vector form, it is
sufficient to shift the cursor for n = 0 in f[n - 1] to the left by “1” unit. Then, using
the vector form of f[n], we can obtain the vector forms of f[n - 1] and f[n - 2] as

3.2.5 Digital Impulse Signal (Function) and Convolution
Operation
Digital impulse function is defined as
δ½  n = 1 n = 0
0 otherwise

ð3:21Þ
Any digital signal can be written as the sum of the shifted and scaled digital
impulse signals, i.e.98 3 Energy, Power, Convolution, and Systems
f n½  = ... þ aδ½ þ n - 2 bδ½ þ n - 1 cδ½ þ n dδ½ þ n þ 1 eδ½ þ n þ 2 ...
which can also be written using the summation symbol as
f n½  = X1
k = - 1
f k½ δ½  n - k ð3:22Þ
from which it is seen that any digital signal can be written as the convolution of itself
and the digital impulse signal, that is:
f n½  = f n½  δ½  n
Some properties of the digital impulse signal are given as
f n½ δ½  n - n0 = f n½  0 δ½  n - n0
X
f n½  δ½  n - n0 = f n½  - n0
f n½ δ½  n - n0 = f n½  0
Example 3.17 δ[n - 1]  δ[n - 2] = ?
Solution 3.17 Using the propertyf[n]  δ[n - n0] = f[n - n0] for the given
convolution, we get
δ½  n - 1 δ½  n - 2 = δ½  n - 1 - 2
= δ½  n - 3
3.3 Systems and Their Features
A system can be defined as an electronic circuit or any organization that receives a
signal as input and produces another signal as output.
The system produces a new signal by processing the signal it receives as input and
presents the processed signal as output. Inspecting the input and output of a system,
we can get an idea about the properties of the system.
For example, a circuit containing a power supply, resistor, and capacitor has a
memory, since a capacitor has energy storage property. But if our circuit consists of
only the power supply and the resistor, there is no memory property. More complex
systems can be obtained by connecting systems in series or parallel. A system can be
analog or digital. In Fig. 3.13, systems are shown using block diagrams. A system
can have the properties: causality, memory, linearity, time invariance, stability, and
invertibility.3.3 Systems and Their Features 99

System x(t) y(t)

x[n] H{.} y[n]
3.3.1 Mathematical Expressions of the Systems
The system takes the signal as input. Let us represent this signal as x(t). It produces
output by processing the input signal. Let us represent the output signal as y(t). The
relationship between output and input can be written as
y tð Þ = H xt f g ð Þ ð3:23Þ
where H{} represents the system operator and it is used to indicate that the system
processes the input data.
If we have more than one system, we can use different letters to denote these
systems, like H1{}, H2{}.
3.3.2 Causality
For a system to be causal, its output at any time must depend on current or past input
data. If the output of the system depends on future input values, then the system is
not causal.
Example 3.18 The relationship between the output and input of a system shown in
Fig. 3.14 is given as y[n] = x[n] + 0.5x[n - 2] + x
2
[n - 3]. Determine whether the
system is causal or not.
Solution 3.18 The relationship between the output and the input of the system is
y[n] = x[n] + 0.5x[n - 2] + x
2
[n - 3] from which it is seen that the output of
the system y[n] depends on the present input x[n] and the past inputs x[n - 2] and
x[n - 3].
y[n] does not depend on any future input. The system, then, has causal property,
or we can say that the system is causal.100 3 Energy, Power, Convolution, and Systems
Example 3.19 The relationship between the output and input of a system is given as
y(t) = x(t + 0.5) + x(t - 2.3) - x
3
(t - 3). Determine whether the system is causal
or not.
Solution 3.19 The system output y(t) depends on the future time input x(t + 0.5).
For this reason, the system is not causal, or we say that the system has no causality
property. Systems without causality property can exist mathematically, but practi￾cally they cannot be constructed. Because non-causal systems need input data from
the future to produce the output in the present, we cannot know the future input.
Especially real-time systems must have causality property. When researchers
design systems, such as equalizers, they first design them mathematically. Then,
they try to make the system causal. This is necessary to get practical systems;
otherwise, the designed systems will remain only theoretical and have no practical
value.
3.3.3 Memory
If the output of a system depends only on the current input, then the system has no
memory.
If the output of the system depends on past or future input data, then the system
has memory, or the system has memory property.
Example 3.20 The relationship between the output and the input of a system is
given by y[n] = x[n] + x
3
[n]. Determine whether the system has memory or not.
Solution 3.20 Since the output of the system y[n] at time n is only a function of the
current input data x[n], the system has no memory.
Example 3.21 The relationship between the output and the input of a system is
given by y(t) = x(t - 1) + x
2
(t). Determine whether the system has memory or not.
Solution 3.21 Since the output of the system y(t) at the time instant t depends on
past input x(t - 1), the system has memory.
3.3.4 Stability
Systems can have bounded-input, bounded-output stability property. If we get
bounded output when we give bounded-input data to a system, then the system is
stable. The system on the other hand is unstable if for the bounded input the output is
unbounded. Let us give two examples to understand the subject. Consider an iron
jerry can and have two small holes on the faces of this jerry can. Assume that the
jerry can is filled with gasoline; if we throw a burning match into one of the holes andclose it, a high amount of pressure, heat, and light will appear at the other hole; and
then we have an unstable system.
3.3 Systems and Their Features 101
Fig. 3.15 Illustration of
stable and unstable systems
Unstable System Stable System
On the other hand, consider a circuit consisting of only a voltage source and a
resistor connected in parallel. The more you increase the source voltage, the more
voltage will be obtained across the resistor, so our system is a stable system. The
magnitude of the voltage across the resistor will be proportional to the magnitude of
the source voltage.
If the input and output of a system are denoted by x(t) and y(t), then for a
bounded-input and bounded-output stable system, for
j j x tð Þ  Mx < 1
we have
j j y tð Þ  My < 1
where Mx and My are real numbers. Unless otherwise indicated we will use the word
“stability” for “bounded-input, bounded-output stability,” and if it is mentioned that
a system is stable, it means that we indicate a bounded-input, bounded-output stable
system. In Fig. 3.15, graphical illustration of stable and unstable systems is available.
As can be interpreted from Fig. 3.15, an unstable system produces an immense
amount of output for very little input, while a stable system produces a small amount
of output for small input.
Example 3.22 The relationship between the output and the input of a system is
given by
y n½  = Xn
k = -1
x k½ 
Determine whether the system is stable or not.
Solution 3.22 To determine whether the system is stable or not, let us consider
bounded-input data to the system, and see if the output of the system is bounded as
well. For the system input, let us use x[n] = u[n] which is unit step function thatsatisfies |x[n]| = |u[n]| < Mx where Mx is a positive real number and it can be chosen
as Mx = 2.
102 3 Energy, Power, Convolution, and Systems
Now let us calculate the output of the system and see if the output is bounded. For
the system input x[n] = u[n], the system output can be calculated as
y n½  = Xn
k = -1
u k½  → y n½  = Xn
k = 0
1→ y n½  = n þ 1, n > 0
For the system output y[n] = n + 1, it is not possible to find a real number My such
that |y[n]| < My. Since n goes to infinity, the output y[n] = n + 1 also goes to infinity,
and we cannot find an upper bound for the output of the system.
Thus, the system is an unstable system; it does not have stability property.
Exercise The relationship between the output and the input of a system is given as
y tð Þ = x2
ðÞþt x tð Þ - 3
Determine whether the system is stable or not.
3.3.5 Invertibility
If the input of a system can be obtained from its output, then the system is invertible.
In other words, a system is invertible if it is possible to have another system from
which the input of the system can be obtained using its output. Consider a system
where the relationship between the output and the input of the system is given by y
[n] = x[n - 1], and let us denote this system by H1.
For a second system, the relationship between the output and the input of the
system is given by k[n] = m[n + 1], and let us denote this system by H2. If y[n] is
taken as input by H2, then the output of H2 can be calculated as
k n½  = m n½  þ 1
= y n½  þ 1
= x n½  - 1 þ 1
= x n½ 
which is nothing but the input of H1. Hence, H2 is the inverse of H1.3.3 Systems and Their Features 103
3.3.6 Linearity
Linearity is another property that a system can have. Let x1 and x2 be two different
inputs of the system. Let the output of the system for these inputs be y1 and y2. For
the system to be a linear system, for the input k1x1 + k2x2 k1, k2 2 R, the output must
be k1y1 + k2y2.
In order to understand whether a system is linear or not, we only need to look at
the equation between its output and input. If the output of the system includes second
or higher powers of the input, then the system is not linear.
Example 3.23 Consider a system with an input-output relationship
y n½  = x2
½  n - 1
determines whether the system is linear or not.
Solution 3.23 Since the output of the system depends on the square of the input
signal, we can directly say that the system is not linear.
Applying the definition of linearity, let us see mathematically that it is not linear.
For inputs x1[n] and x2[n], the outputs are y1½  n = x2
1½  n - 1 and y2½  n = x2
2½n - 1 .
If the system output for the input x1[n] + x2[n], k1 = k2 = 1 equals y1[n] + y2[n], then
the system is linear. For input x1[n] + x2[n], the output is (x1[n - 1] + x2[n - 1])2
which is not equal to y1[n] + y2[n]. Hence, the system is not linear.
Example 3.24 The relationship between input and output of a system is given as
y(t) = x(t)x(t - 1). Determine whether the system is linear or not.
Solution 3.24 For input x1(t), the output is y1(t) = x1(t)x1(t - 1). For input x2(t), the
output is y2(t) = x2(t)x2(t - 1). For input x1(t) + x2(t), the output is
y tð Þ = ð Þ x1ðÞþt x2ð Þt ð Þ x1ð Þþ t - 1 x2ð Þ t - 1
= x1ð Þt x1ð Þþ t - 1 x1ð Þt x2ð Þþ t - 1 x2ð Þt x1ð Þþ t - 1 x2ð Þt x2ð Þ t - 1
which is not equal to y1(t) + y2(t), i.e., y(t) ≠ y1(t) + y2(t). Hence, the system is not
linear.
Exercise Determine whether the system defined by y[n] = x[n] + 2x[n - 1] is linear
or not.
3.3.7 Time Invariance
For a system to be time-invariant, the time-shifted input must produce time-shifted
output. The shift amount at the input and output must be the same.104 3 Energy, Power, Convolution, and Systems
That is, for the input signal x(t) if the output is y(t), then for a time-invariant
system, for the input x(t - t0), the output is y(t - t0), or for the input x(t + t0), the
output is y(t + t0).
Example 3.25 The relationship between input and output of a system is given by
y tð Þ = x tð Þ
R tð Þ
Determine whether the system is time-invariant or not.
Solution 3.25 For input x(t), the output is
x tð Þ
R tð Þ
For input x(t - t0), the output is
x tð Þ - t0
R tð Þ
For the system to be time-invariant, for the input x(t - t0), the output must be
y tð Þ - t0 = x tð Þ - t0
R tð Þ - t0
However,
x tð Þ - t0
R tð Þ ≠ y tð Þ - t0 = x tð Þ - t0
R tð Þ - t0
Hence, the system is time-dependent, and it is not time-invariant.
Example 3.26 Show that the system defined by
y tð Þ =
Zt
-1
xð Þτ dτ
is time-invariant.
Solution 3.26 For input x(t - t0), the output is3.3 Systems and Their Features 105
y1ð Þt =
Zt
- 1
xð Þ τ - t0 dτ
For the time-invariant system, we have
y1ð Þt = y tð Þ - t0
Making parameter change in
y tð Þ - t0 =
Zt - t0
-1
xð Þτ dτ
such that τ
′ = τ + t0 we get
y tð Þ - t0 =
Zt
-1
x τ0 ð Þdτ0
from which we can write that
y tð Þ - t0 = y1ð Þt
Hence, the system is time-invariant.

3.3.8 Time Domain Representations of Linear
and Time-Invariant Systems
Any digital signal x[n] can be written as the sum of the shifted impulse functions.
The digital signal in Fig. 3.16 can be written as
x n½  = - δ½  n þ 2 þ 2δ½ þ n þ 1 δ½  n - 2 - 2δ½  n - 4

where x[k] is the amplitude at time instant k. The equation (3.24) can also be written
as
x n½  = x n½  δ½  n ð3:25Þ
Consider a system H{} having linearity and time-invariance properties. Such a
system can also be called a linear and time-invariant system, i.e., LTI system, in
short. Assume that the LTI system has input x[n] and output y[n] as depicted in
Fig. 3.17.
For input x[n] = δ[n], let us denote the output by y[n] = h[n] as illustrated in
Fig. 3.18.
In Fig. 3.17, the relationship between y[n] and x[n] can be expressed as
y n½  = H xn f g ½ 
where substituting
x n½  = X1
k = - 1
x k½ δ½  n - k
we get3.3 Systems and Their Features 107
y n½  = H xn f g ½ 
= H X1
k = - 1
x k½ δ½  n - k
( )
where moving H{} operator inside the summation term we obtain
y n½  = X1
k = -1
x k½ Hf g δ½  n - k ð3:26Þ
The system is an LTI system, and for
x n½  = δ½  n
the output is
y n½  = h n½ 
Due to the time-invariance property, for input
x n½  = δ½  n - k
the system output happens to be
y n½  = h n½  - k
that is, if
h n½  = Hf g δ½  n
then we have
h n½  - k = Hf g δ½  n - k
When
h n½  - k = Hf g δ½  n - k
is substituted in (3.26), we get
y n½  = X1
k = -1
x k½ h n½  - k
which can be also written as108 3 Energy, Power, Convolution, and Systems
y n½  = x n½  h n½  ð3:27Þ
which means that if the output of the system for the impulse input is known, the
output for any input can be calculated by taking the convolution of input and impulse
response.
The special output h[n] obtained for impulse input is called impulse response.
Note that to use
y n½  = x n½  h n½ 
property, the system should have linearity and time-invariance properties, i.e., it
should be an LTI system,
If the system is not an LTI system, then we can still calculate the impulse response
of the system; however, we cannot use the equation
y n½  = x n½  h n½ 
to calculate the output for an arbitrary input signal. Although we explained the
subject for digital systems, the results we obtained are also valid for continuous-time
systems. Let h(t) be the impulse response of a continuous LTI system. The system
output for input x(t) can be calculated using
y tð Þ = x tðÞ h tð Þ ð3:28Þ
Example 3.27 Consider an LTI system with an input-output relationship y[n] = x
[n] + 0.5x[n - 2]. Find the impulse response of the system.
Solution 3.27 The impulse response of the system is the output of the system when
the input data is impulse.
For input x[n] = δ[n], the system output can be calculated as
h n½  = δ½ þ n 0:5δ½  n - 2
which can also be written as
h n½  =
1 n = 0
0:5 n = 2

Solution 3.28 Let us express the input signal in terms of the impulse function as in
x n½  = δ½ þ n 2δ½  n - 3 - 0:5δ½  n - 4
When the input signal is impulse, the output of the system is h[n] as illustrated in
Fig. 3.19.
Since the system has time-invariance property, then for the input δ[n - 3], the
output is h[n - 3], and for the input δ[n - 4], the output is h[n - 4] as shown in
Fig. 3.20.
Since the system has also linearity property, then for the input signal
x n½  = δ½ þ n 2δ½  n - 3 - 0:5δ½  n - 4
the system output happens to be
y n½  = h n½ þ 2h n½  - 3 - 0:5h n½  - 4

3.3.10 The Response of a Linear and Time-Invariant System
to an Exponential Signal
Let h[n] be the impulse response of an LTI digital system. For exponential input
x[n] = e jΩn
, the system output is calculated as
y n½  = x n½  h n½ 
= X1
k = -1
h k½ x n½  - k
= X1
k = -1
h k½ ejΩð Þ n - k
= ejΩn X1
k = - 1
h k½ e - jΩk
where the expression
X1
k = - 1
h k½ e - jΩk
is the Fourier transform of h[n], and it is indicated by H(Ω). Hence, the system output
for the exponential input signal can be written as
y n½  = ejΩn
Hð Þ Ω ð3:31Þ
Some authors define the Fourier transform as
Hð Þ Ω = 1
ffiffiffiffiffi

In this case, output is written as
y n½  = ejΩn ffiffiffiffiffi
2π p Hð Þ Ω
Now, let us try to calculate the output of a linear and time-invariant system for
cosine input signal. The input signal

(Ω) is the complex conjugate of H(Ω).
The complex function H(Ω) can be written as
Hð Þ Ω = j j Hð Þ Ω ∠Hð Þ Ω ð3:33Þ
When (3.33) is substituted into (3.32), we obtain
y n½  = 1

ejψ þ j j Hð Þ Ω e - j∠j j Hð Þ Ω e - jΩn

Solution 3.33 We can use the formula
y n½  = j j Hð Þ Ω cosð Þ ∠Hð Þ Ω þ Ωn þ ψ 3:35Þ

Example 3.34 The impulse response of an LTI system is given as
h n½  = δ½  n - 2
For input x n½  = sin Ωn þ π
4 , calculate the system output y[n].
Solution 3.34 The input signal is a sine signal which is a phase-shifted version of a
cosine signal, and it can be written in terms of a cosine signal, and we can use the
expression
y n½  = j j Hð Þ Ω cosð Þ ∠Hð Þ Ω þ Ωn þ ψ
to calculate the system output. We leave the rest of the solution to the reader.
Note Although we considered only digital systems up to this point, similar formulas
can be derived for continuous-time systems as well. If the impulse response of a
continuous LTI system is known, then the output of the continuous-time system for
the exponential input e jwt can be calculated asy t = x t h t

3.3.11 Determining the Properties of a Linear
and Time-Invariant System from Impulse Response
The properties of systems are memory, causality, linearity, time invariance, and
stability. If a system is linear and time-invariant, the rest of its properties (stability,
causality, memory) can be determined directly from the system’s impulse response.
Memory
If the impulse responses of linear and time-invariant systems (digital or continuous￾time) are in the form
h n½  = Kδ½  n h tð Þ = Mδð Þt ð3:37Þ
then the systems are memoryless; otherwise, the systems have memory.X
X
3.3 Systems and Their Features 117
Proof The output of a digital LTI system can be calculated using
y n½  =
k
h k½ x n½  - k
where the output of the system y[n] does not depend on the past and future input data
if we have
h k½  = K k = 0
0 otherwise 
Otherwise, when
y n½  =
X
k
h k½ x x½  - k
is expanded, y[n] will contain input data from the past or future. This means that the
system has memory. For continuous-time systems, a similar proof can be achieved.
Causality
For an LTI system to be a causal system, its impulse response must satisfy,
depending on whether the system is digital or continuous, one of the expressions
h n½  = 0 n < 0, h tð Þ = 0 t  0 ð3:38Þ
Proof System output can be expressed as
y n½  =
k
h k½ x n½  - k
which depends on future input values, i.e., x[n + 1], x[n + 2], ..., for negative
k values. If
h k½  = 0 k < 0
then y[n] does not contain future inputs, and we have a causal system.ð

|AB| = |A||B| we get

where the right hand side is a finite number if we have

Hence, for a digital LTI system to be a stable system, its impulse response should
be absolutely summable.
Example 3.35 An LTI system is depicted in Fig. 3.22. Determine whether the
system is stable or not.
Solution 3.35 For a digital LTI system to be a stable system, its impulse response
should be absolutely summable, i.e., impulse response must satisfy

for which if we use (3.39), we obtain
X
k
j j u k½  = Xn
k = 0

which is not a finite number. Since the absolute sum of the impulse response is not a
finite number, then the system is an unstable system.

Fig. 3.23. Find the impulse response of this system.
Solution 3.36 For x[n] = δ[n] the output is denoted by y[n] = h[n]. For impulse
input, the output of the system can be written as

the system output is
y1½  n = x Mn ½  - n0
We have
y n½  - n0 = xM n ½  ð Þ - n0
Since
y1½  n ≠ y n½  - n0
the system does not have time-invariance property.

Fourier Analysis of Continuous-Time
Signals
In this chapter, we explain the Fourier series representation of continuous-time
signals. The history of the trigonometric sum goes back to the Babylonians. First,
Euler examined the vibrating string and discovered that the frequencies produced by
the string were harmonics of each other. Following Euler, the French scientist
Fourier, born in 1768, worked on trigonometric series and showed that periodic
signals could be written as the sum of harmonically related sinusoidal signals.
Fourier later showed that non-periodic signals can be written as the integral of
sinusoidal signals that are not harmonic with each other. Fourier’s work did not
attract much attention during his lifetime. After his death, his work revolutionized
the world of mathematics, and his studies are used in many areas of the engineering
sciences. During Fourier’s lifetime, many talented scientists like him inspected his
work. Some of these scientists are Laplace, Lagrange, Euler, and Monge. Fourier’s
contributions to the science of mathematics led to important studies in many areas of
engineering. Many new designs are achieved by examining the properties of signals
in the frequency domain. In particular, music, medical engineering, and communi￾cation engineering were accelerated by Fourier’s contributions.
In this chapter, first, we define the periodic signal and learn how to calculate the
period of periodic signals. Next, we deal with the Fourier series representations of
continuous-time signals. That is, we explain how to express periodic signals as the
sum of complex sinusoidal signals. In the sequel, we focus on the Fourier integral
representations of non-periodic signals. The Fourier integral representation of
non-periodic signals is a mathematical representation method developed using
periodic signals. Following the Fourier integral subject, we consider the Fourier
transform, which is the complex representation of the Fourier integral. The Fourier
transform expression can be considered to be the most important subject of signal
processing, and many methods developed are based on the Fourier transform.

Periodic Signals
Continuous-Time Periodic Signal
The signal f(t) is a periodic signal if it satisfies
f tð Þ = f tð Þ þ kT , k 2 Z, T 2 R ð4:1Þ
where T is the fundamental period of f(t). Any multiple of the fundamental period is
another period of the function. The frequency of a signal whose principal period is
T is calculated as
f = 1
T ð4:2Þ
Angular frequency is defined as
w = 2πf ð4:3Þ
which has the unit of radian per second, i.e., radian
s .
Example 4.1 Find the period of f(t) = cos (200πt).
Solution 4.1 Using f(t) = f(t + T) for the given function, we get
cos 200 ð Þ πt = cos 200 ð Þ πð Þ t þ T
which can be written as
cos 200 ð Þ πt þ 2kπ = cosð Þ 200πt þ 200πT , k 2 Z
where using k = 1 we calculate the fundamental period as
2π = 200πT → T = 1

Property Let the period of f(t) be T1 and the period of g(t) be T2. The period of
h tð Þ = af tð Þ þ bg tð Þ

Fourier Series Representations of Continuous-Time Periodic Signals
In this section, we will see how to write any periodic signal in terms of base signals.
As it is known in linear algebra, any vector can be written as a combination of unit
(base) vectors, i.e., v = c1e1 + c2e2 + c3e3 + ... where e1, e2, e3, ... are basis
vectors, c1, c2, c3, ... are real numbers (coefficients). Let us give a physical example
to warm up the subject further. Let us take a look at the cake making. The basic
ingredients needed to make a cake can be summarized as flour, sugar, salt, oil, and
eggs. Here, flour, sugar, salt, oil, and eggs are the basic ingredients used for cake
making. The basic form of the cake is obtained by mixing these basic ingredients in
certain proportions. Bread products can also be obtained by mixing these basic
materials in certain proportions. Then, any product can be obtained using certain
portions of basic materials.
A similar logic applies to periodic signals. Any periodic signal can be obtained by
adding cosine, sine signals, and a real number in certain proportions. Cosine and sine
signals can be thought of as the basic materials of periodic signals. Just as matter is
formed by the combination of molecules in various proportions, periodic signals are
obtained by multiplying the cosine and sine functions with certain coefficients and
summing them. For example, a periodic square wave can be written as the sum of
cosine and sine signals.
Theorem Let f(t) be a periodic signal such that
f tð Þ = f tð Þ þ kT , k 2 Z, T 2 R ð4:4Þ
where T is the fundamental period of f(t). Fourier series representation of f(t) is

In this book, we will use (4.5) and (4.6) for Fourier series representation. The
Fourier series representation takes a simpler form for odd and even signals.
Even Signal
If f(t) satisfies (t) = f(-t) , then f(t) is an even signal. The graphs of even signals are
symmetric with respect to the vertical axis.
Example 4.3 The graph of f(t) is depicted in Fig. 4.1 where it is seen that the signal
is symmetric with respect to the vertical axis.

Odd Signal
If f(t) satisfies f(-t) = - f(t), then f(t) is an odd signal. The graphs of odd signals are
symmetric with respect to the origin.
Example 4.4 The graph of the odd signal f(t) is depicted in Fig. 4.2 where it is seen
that the graph is symmetric with respect to the origin.
Example 4.5 The graph of an odd signal is depicted in Fig. 4.3.
Any signal can be odd or even or have neither of these two properties. It is
possible to write any arbitrary signal as the sum of an odd and an even signal, i.e.,
f tð Þ = g tðÞþ k tð Þ
where f(t) is an arbitrary signal, g(t) is an even signal, and k(t) is an odd signal. The
signals g(t) and k(t) can be obtained from f(t) as
g tð Þ = f tðÞþ fð - tÞ
2 k tð Þ = f tð Þ - fð Þ - t
2 ð4:7Þ
For even signal f(t), we have k(t) = 0, and for odd signal f(t), we have g(t) = 0.136 4 Fourier Analysis of Continuous-Time Signals
Fourier Series Representations of Even and Odd Signals
Fourier series representations of odd and even signals are simpler than other
functions. Let us see the Fourier series representations of odd and even signals
with a theorem.
Theorem The period of f(t) is T, and f(t) is an even signal, i.e., f(t) = f(-t). The
Fourier series representation of f(t) is
f tð Þ = A½ þ 0 X1

B k½  = 0, k = 0,1,2, ...
ð4:8Þ
where it is seen that B[k] equals to zero, i.e., for an even signal, only A[k] can have
non-zero values, and no need to calculate B[k]. When calculating A[k] for even
signals, the integral is taken from 0 to T/2, and unlike the previous ones, there is a
coefficient 4/T at the beginning of the integral.
Let us now examine the case of odd signals. Assume that f(t) is an odd periodic
signal, such that f(-t) = - f(t). The Fourier series expansion of the signal is
f tð Þ = X1
k = 1

For odd signals, the coefficients A[0] and A[k] equal to zero, and for the calcu￾lation of B[k], the integral is evaluated from 0 to T/2, and unlike the previous ones,
coefficient 4/T is used in front of the integral.4.1 Fourier Series Representations of Continuous-Time Periodic Signals 137

Example 4.6 One period of a periodic signal is given in Fig. 4.4. The period of the
signal is T = 4. Obtain the Fourier series representation of the signal.
Solution 4.6 The signal is symmetric about the origin, and it is an odd signal. There
is no need to calculate the coefficients A[0] and A[k]; since the coefficients A[0] and
A[k] equal to zero, it is sufficient to calculate the coefficient B[k].
Considering Fig. 4.4, we can obtain the mathematical expression of the signal for
0  t  2 as
f tð Þ = - δð Þþ t þ 1 δð Þ t - 1 → 0  t < 2 f tð Þ = δð Þ t - 1

Now let us calculate the complex Fourier series coefficients of the signal. For
this purpose, we can use the formula used to calculate the complex coefficients, or
we can directly use the formula showing the relationship between the complex
coefficients and the real coefficients. For convenience, let us follow the second
approach as
F½  0 = A½  0 F k½  = 1
2 ð Þ A k½  - jB k½ 
resulting in F[0] = 0 and F[k] = -0.5jB[k]. The complex coefficient Fourier series

To solve this problem, we directly used the formulas for the calculation of Fourier
series coefficients. However, if we take the derivative of the signal first and calculate
the Fourier coefficients for the derivative signal and then obtain the Fourier series
coefficients of the f(t) signal, we would deal with mathematically easier integrals.
Since the derivative signal contains impulses, it is easier to integrate it.
In this problem, the integral calculation for f(t) is not very difficult, but we
recommend simplifying the integration operations by taking the derivatives of the
signal so that the integral calculations can be made more easily. We will consider the
solution with this method in the next example.
If we look at the Fourier series representation of the f(t) signal, it is seen that the
summation process goes on till infinity. In practice, the upper limit of the summation
operator is a finite number. The limited summation results of the Fourier series
expansion of f(t) for m = 2 (amplitude) are displayed in Figs. 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9. It is
seen from Figs. 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9 that the limited summation result looks more like a
square wave as the number of summed terms increases.
The Fourier series representation for limited summation can be written as

which are plotted, for different N values and for the value of m = 2 (amplitude), in

It is seen from Figs. 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9 that the more N increases, the more the
resulting graph gets closer to the square wave.
Example 4.10 Obtain the Fourier series representation of the signal shown in
Fig. 4.10.
Solution 4.10 The Fourier series coefficients of f(t) can be found directly, or by
taking the derivative of the signal, the Fourier series coefficients of the derivative
signal can be calculated first, and then the Fourier series coefficients of the original
signal can be calculated using the Fourier series coefficients of the derivative signal.
Let g(t) be the derivative of f(t). The relationship between the complex Fourier
series coefficients of the signal f(t) and the complex Fourier series coefficients of the

Convergence of Fourier Series
Let f(t) be a periodic signal such that f(t) = f(t + T) where T is the fundamental
period of the signal. A periodic signal must satisfy the following properties in order
to have the Fourier series representation:
1. f(t) is a piecewise continuous signal.
2. f(t) has left and right derivatives at every point of the range in which it is defined.
It is possible to get the Fourier series representation of the periodic signal f(t) that
has both of the properties. If the signal does not satisfy one of the properties, it is not
possible to get the Fourier series representation of the signal. The value of the
Fourier series at the discontinuity points of f(t) is equal to the mean value of the
left and right limits of the signal at the discontinuity point.152 4 Fourier Analysis of Continuous-Time Signals

it is defined.

then the signal f(t) has no derivative at t0.
Note The continuity of a signal at a point and its derivative at the same point are two
different things. A signal may be continuous at a point, but may not have a derivative
at that point. We cannot say the same for the opposite case. That is, if a signal has a
derivative at a point, then the signal is also continuous at that point.
There is no derivative value at discontinuity points and sharp turning points in the
graph of a signal. In other words, if we cannot draw a tangent line to a point, the
signal has no derivative at that point. The signal whose graph is depicted in Fig. 4.17
is non-differentiable at points t0, t1, and t2.
Piecewise Continuous Signal
A signal that is continuous in a given interval [a, b] and is not continuous at a finite
number of t1, t2, ..., tn points and has one-sided limit at these points is called a
piecewise continuous signal.
Fourier Integral
Fourier series are used to express periodic signals in terms of sinusoidal signals. The
Fourier integral, on the other hand, is used to express non-periodic, finite signals in
terms of sinusoidal signals. The Fourier integral is the limiting case of the Fourier
series as the period goes to infinity. That is, the Fourier integral notation is derived
from the Fourier series notation. Now let us try to derive the Fourier integral
representation of a non-periodic finite signal.

Then, it is possible to obtain the real Fourier series coefficients of the periodic
signal by sampling the Fourier integral expressions A(w) and B(w), which are
calculated using only one period of the periodic signal.

at which the signal g(t) is discontinuous, the value of the Fourier integral at a
discontinuity point is equal to the average value of the left and right limits of the
signal at the discontinuity point.

It is seen from the graphs in Fig. 4.24 that as the upper limit value of the integral
increases, the resulting shape gets closer to the square pulse, and it is also seen that
sharpening the corners of the square improves slowly. If we use very large upper
frontier values for integral, perfect corners can be achieved.170 4 Fourier Analysis of Continuous-Time Signals

Integration can be considered as summing the integrand values at small intervals.
In communication, if the signal to be sent contains sharp turning points as in a square
wave, its Fourier integral contain needs a very large upper frontier value, and this
means that it contains sinusoidal signals with very large frequencies which implies a
very large bandwidth. Therefore, in communication, pulse-shaping is applied to
eliminate the sharp parts of the signal to be transmitted so that a signal with smoother
transitions and a lower bandwidth is obtained.

For odd signals, unlike even signals, A(w) equals zero, and B(w) is non-zero.
Theorem If f(t) is a right-sided signal, i.e., f(t) = 0 if t < 0, the Fourier integral
representation of f(t) can be either as

where

π
Z1

f tð Þsin ð Þ wt dt ð4:73Þ
Proof A right-sided signal f(t) takes values only for t > 0, and it is always equal to
zero for t < 0. Let us define g(t) as
g tð Þ = f tð Þ þ fð Þ - t
which is an even signal, i.e., g(t) = g(-t), and the Fourier integral representation of
g(t) can be written as4.2 Fourier Integral and Fourier Transform 173

where
A wð Þ = 2

Z1

g tð Þ cosð Þ wt dt ð4:75Þ
In (4.75), the integral is evaluated from 0 to 1, i.e., it is calculated for positive
t values. Since f(t) is a right-sided signal, the expression
0  t < 1 g tð Þ = f tðÞþ fð Þ - t ð4:76Þ
can be written as
0  t < 1 g tð Þ = f tð Þ ð4:77Þ
since for positive t values we have f(-t) = 0. Substituting (4.77) in (4.75), we obtain
A wð Þ = 2
π
Z1
0
f tð Þ cosð Þ wt dt ð4:78Þ
and for t > 0 we have
g tð Þ = f tð Þ→ g tð Þ =
Z1
0
A wð Þ cosð Þ wt dt ð4:79Þ
Similarly, using f(t) we can obtain the odd signal g(t), and considering the Fourier
integral representation of g(t), we can prove the second part of the theorem.
To summarize, a right-sided signal can be illustrated by Fourier integral representa￾tions of both even and odd signals.
Exercise Let f(t) be a left-sided signal such that f(t) = 0 if t > 0 and f(t) ≠ 0 if t < 0.

4.2.2 Fourier Transform
In this section, we first explain the Fourier transforms of non-periodic signals. Then,
we consider the Fourier transforms of periodic signals. We obtain Fourier transform
and inverse Fourier transform expressions of non-periodic signals from the Fourier
integral formulas. The Fourier integral formula is used for non-periodic signals.
Fourier integral representation for any non-periodic signal f(t) is

which corresponds to bf wð Þ = πð Þ A wð Þ - jB wð Þ :

ð4:102Þ
On the right side of (4.102), A(w) and cos(wt) are even signals, and B(w) and
sin(wt) are odd signals. When an even signal is multiplied by an odd signal, the
resulting signal becomes an odd signal. The integral of an odd signal is zero. For
instance, the product A(w) sin (wt) is an odd signal, and we have
Z1
w = -1
A wð Þsin ð Þ wt dw = 0 ð4:103Þ
Expanding the multiplications on the right-hand side of (4.102), and using
(4.103), we obtain

The right-hand side of (4.94) equals 2f(t) where the coefficient 2 is due to the
integral frontiers ranging from -1 to +1. In (4.96), frontiers range from 0 to +1.

On the other hand, if the Fourier transform is defined as

The notation we will use throughout the book for the Fourier transform and the

which can also be simplified as
bf = FTð Þf f = FT - 1 bf

The parameter w in the Fourier transform represents the angular frequency and is
equal to 2πf, i.e., w = 2πf, where f is the frequency in Hertz.182 4 Fourier Analysis of Continuous-Time Signals

Note In general, if Fourier transform of f(t) is defined as

where T is the period of g(t), and T is selected in a way that shifted replicas of f(t) do

The Fourier transform integral may not be computable for every non-periodic
signal. A signal must satisfy a number of conditions for its Fourier transform integral
to be computable.
Theorem Let f(t) be a non-periodic signal. In order for f(t) to have Fourier trans￾form, it must satisfy the following conditions:
1. The absolute value of f(t) must be integrable with respect to the time parameter.
2. f(t) must be a piecewise continuous signal over every finite interval.

calculated, since it only contains impulses, and using (4.140) we can find the Fourier

Fourier Analysis of Digital Signals
The advances in digital computers after the Second World War led to the appearance
of a new engineering branch. Digital signal processing is the name of this engineer￾ing branch. Advances in computer technology have led to the design of almost all
signal processing methods with digital technology. Analog technology has been
almost completely abandoned, and most newly manufactured devices are digitally
designed. Signal processing techniques developed for continuous-time signals are
adapted to digital signals. Some of these digital signal processing techniques are
Fourier series representation of digital signals and digital Fourier transform. The
formula for the Fourier series representation of digital signals is obtained using the
Fourier series representation formula of continuous-time signals. Despite advances
in computer technology, some signal processing algorithms are still time-consuming
and need huge computation amount for computers. For this reason, algorithms are
modified to run faster by computers. One of the best known of these algorithms is the
fast Fourier transform algorithm developed in the 1960s. With the development of
this algorithm, there has been an acceleration in the design of systems used for signal
processing.
In the world of digital technology, devices for signal processing are designed,
some of which are digital signal processing chips, i.e., DSP chips and field program￾mable gate arrays (FPGAs). With the development of DSP chips, many algorithms
implemented as hardware in the past were able to be realized as software. An
example of this is the software radio. Devices produced as hardware can only be
manufactured once and cannot be changed after they are produced. Devices pro￾duced using the software can be repeatedly changed and adapted to new technolo￾gies. There has been intense work on software programmable DSP and FPGA chips
lately. The biggest disadvantage of software-developed devices is that they run
slower than hardware-built devices. In order to alleviate this disadvantage, DSP
algorithms are modified for parallel implementations. DSP and FPGA chips are used
for parallel programming. Further studies focused on having DSP and FPGA chips
consuming less power to enable the portability of digital devices.

5.1 Fourier Series Representations of Digital Signals
5.1.1 Periodic Digital Signal
For x[n], if we have x[n] = x[n + kN], N 2 Z, k 2 Z, then x[n] is a periodic signal
with period N which is also called fundamental period. Every multiple of the
fundamental period is another period of x[n].
The angular frequency of the digital signal with period N is calculated as
Ωp = 2π
N ð5:1Þ
The unit of the angular frequency is the radian. In (5.1), N is an integer.
Property Let the period of x[n] be N1 and the period of y[n] be N2. The period of
h[n] = ax[n] + by[n] equals to the least common multiple of N1 and N2.
Note Sinusoidal continuous-time signals are always periodic, but the same cannot
be said for digital sinusoidal signals.
Example 5.1 Is x[n] = sin (3n) a periodic signal? If it is a periodic signal, then find
the period of this signal.
Solution 5.1 Using x[n] = x[n + N], we obtain
sin 3ð Þn = sin 3ð Þ ð Þ n þ N
sin 3ð Þ n þ 2π = sin 3ð Þ n þ 3N
N = 2π

x n½  ! DTFSC X k½  ð5:4Þ
where DTFSC means discrete-time Fourier series coefficients.
Notation In the Fourier series representations of digital signals, we use the symbol
X[k] to represent the Fourier series coefficients. In some books, xk is used instead of
X[k]. xk or X[k] represents a complex number for each k value. In other words,
xk represents a sequence of complex numbers. The Fourier series representation
formulas can also be written as

In Eqs. (5.2), (5.3), (5.5), and (5.6), summation can be evaluated from 0 to
(N - 1). Evaluating the summation over one period for different beginnings and
ends other than 0 and (N - 1) gives the same results.

which is a complex periodic signal whose period is 5. That is, the period of X[k] is
the same as the period of x[n], i.e., we have x[n] = x[n + 5] and X[k] = X[k + 5].
Definition The complex number X[k] has both magnitude and phase. The
magnitude of X[k], i.e., jX[k]j, is called the magnitude spectrum of x[n]. The
phase of X[k], ∠X[k], is called the phase spectrum of x[n].
Example 5.3 Obtain the Fourier series representation of

Solution 5.3 Fourier series representation is available only for periodic signals; for
this reason, we should first check whether the signal is periodic or not; if it is
periodic, then we should find the period of the signal as a second process.
As it is stated before, every continuous-time sine signal is periodic, but the same
is not true for digital sine signals. The digital cosine signal given in this question is
periodic and has a period of N = 6. That is, we have x[n] = x[n + 6], as verified in

5.1.3 Properties for the Fourier Series Representation
of Discrete-Time Periodic Signals (Digital Signals)
Let x[n] and y[n] be the two periodic digital signals with common period N, and let
X[k] and Y[k] be the Fourier series coefficients of x[n] and y[n]. We have the
properties listed in Table 5.1 for these signals.
If x[n] is an even signal, i.e., x[-n] = x[n], then we have X[-k] = X[k].
If x[n] is an odd signal, i.e., x[-n] = -x[n], then we have X[-k] = -X[k].

The Fourier transform may not exist for some non-periodic digital signals.
In order for a non-periodic signal xop[n] to have Fourier transform, it must satisfy
one of the conditions:
1. The signal xop[n] must be absolutely summable, that is,
X1
n = -1
xop½  n 	
	 	
	 < 1 5:28Þ
2. The xop[n] must be a finite energy signal, that is,

Note There are important differences between the Fourier transform of a
continuous-time signal and the Fourier transform of a digital signal. Let x(t) be a
continuous-time signal, and y[n] be a digital signal. For these signals, the Fourier
transform and inverse Fourier transform expressions are given asZ Z

Solution 5.14 We cannot directly solve this question using the inverse Fourier
transform formula. Let us first write X(Ω) in terms of the exponential functions
and then compare it to the Fourier transform formula. X(Ω) can be written in terms of
the exponential functions as

Laplace Transform
The Laplace transform was developed by the French mathematician and astronomer
Pierre-Simon Laplace, who lived between 1749 and 1827. He has been called the
Newton of France by some scientists.
The Laplace transform is a more general version of the continuous-time Fourier
transform, and it can be applied to a broader class of signals. The Fourier transform is
available for absolutely integrable signals. The absolute integral of an impulse
response of an unstable system is not finite. It is not possible to examine the impulse
response of such a system with the Fourier transform. However, the impulse
response of the same system can be studied with the Laplace transform. Many
properties of the Laplace transform are similar to the properties of Fourier transform.
There are two types of Laplace transform, one-sided and two-sided Laplace
transforms. One-sided Laplace transform is used by real-time systems. The
two-sided Laplace transform, on the other hand, does not make much sense for
real-time systems, even if it is defined mathematically. Many systems can be easily
analyzed, or many problems can be easily solved using the Laplace transform. Some
of the areas where Laplace transform is applied are circuit analysis, solution of
differential equations, root locus analysis in control engineering, etc. The output of a
system can be calculated by multiplying the Laplace transform of the system’s
transfer function by the Laplace transform of its input. Using the Laplace transform
of the impulse response of a linear and time-invariant system, we can determine
many properties of the system.
In the following sections, we will first define the Laplace transform. Finding the
convergence region of the Laplace transform is the second topic we will cover in this
chapter. In sequel, properties of the Laplace transform will be covered. Laplace
transforms of derivatives and integrals of functions and solutions of differential
equations using Laplace transform are covered next. The Laplace transforms of
some special functions are the last topic we will cover.

261262 6 Laplace Transform
6.1 Laplace Transform
The Laplace transform is used for continuous-time signals, and it is a more general
form of the Fourier transform. Laplace transform can be calculated for some signals
whose Fourier transform is not available. For any continuous-time signal f(t), two
types of Laplace transform can be defined, one-sided and two-sided Laplace trans￾forms. One-sided Laplace transform is defined as
F sð Þ =
Z1
t = 0
f tð Þe - stdt ð6:1Þ
and two-sided Laplace transform is defined as
F sð Þ =
Z1
t = - 1
f tð Þe - stdt ð6:2Þ
where s is a complex number defined as s = σ + jw. There is a close relationship
between the Laplace transform and the Fourier transform. If the Fourier transform is
defined as
bf wð Þ = 1
ffiffiffiffiffi
2π p
Z1
t = -1
f tð Þe - jwtdt ð6:3Þ
then the Laplace transform should be defined as
F sð Þ = 1
ffiffiffiffiffi
2π p
Z1
t = - 1
f tð Þe - stdt ð6:4Þ
Since many authors use the Laplace transform definition in their books as
F sð Þ =
Z1
t = - 1
f tð Þe - stdt ð6:5Þ
we will continue this conventional definition throughout the chapter. In fact, the
one-sided Laplace transform of f(t) is nothing, but the two-sided Laplace transform
of f(t)u(t). We will use the two-sided Laplace transform when we refer to the Laplace
transform unless otherwise stated in this book.
If the parameter s in the Laplace transform formula6.1 Laplace Transform 263
F sð Þ =
Z1
t = - 1
f tð Þu tð Þe - stdt ð6:6Þ
is a purely imaginary complex number, i.e., if s = jw, then we get
F sð Þ =
Z1
t = - 1
f tð Þu tð Þe - jwtdt ð6:7Þ
which is Fourier transform formula. It is seen that the Laplace transform is a more
generalized form of the Fourier transform.
Substituting s = σ + jw in the Laplace transform formula
F sð Þ =
Z1
t = - 1
f tð Þu tð Þe - stdt ð6:8Þ
we get
Fð Þ σ þ jw =
Z1
t = - 1
f tð Þu tð Þe - ð Þ σþjw t
dt
=
Z1
t = -1
f tð Þu tð Þe - σt
e - jwtdt
ð6:9Þ
from which it is seen that Laplace transform of f(t)u(t) equals to the Fourier transform
of f(t)u(t)e
-σt
. The magnitude of the product term f(t)u(t)e
-σt may increase of
decrease depending on the value of σ.
The range of σ values, for which the integral
F sð Þ =
Z1
t = - 1
f tð Þu tð Þe - stdt ð6:10Þ
results in a finite value, is called region of convergence for the Laplace transform of
f(t). For some functions, the Laplace transform may not be found. For a function to
have a Laplace transform in a certain region, it must satisfy some conditions. Let us
now explain these conditions.
Theorem For f(t) to have a one-sided Laplace transform, it should satisfy the
following:264 6 Laplace Transform
(a) f(t) must be a piecewise continuous function on the interval [0⋯1).
(b) For Re{s} > k on a region, the function must satisfy jf(t)j  Cekt.
Proof If the function f(t) is piecewise continuous on the interval (- 1 ⋯1), then
the function e
-stf(t) can be integrated on the interval [0⋯1). We have

which for Re{s} > k leads to
j j F sð Þ = C
σ - k < 1
Example 6.1 Find the Laplace transform of x(t) = e
-atu(t).
Solution 6.1 We can calculate the Laplace transform using
X sð Þ =
Z1
t = - 1
x tð Þe - stdt ð6:11Þ
where substituting x(t) = e
-atu(t) we get
X sð Þ =
Z1
t = -1
e - atu tð Þe - stdt ð6:12Þ
leading to
X sð Þ =
Z1
t = 0
e - ð Þ sþa t
dt ð6:13Þ
where substituting s = σ + jw, we obtain
X sð Þ =
Z1
t = 0
e - ð Þ σþaþjw t
dt
=
Z1
t = 0
e - ð Þ σþa t
e - jwtdt
ð6:14Þ
where e
-jwt denotes the unit circle and je
-jwtj = 1. Then, the product term6.1 Laplace Transform 265
e - ð Þ σþa t
e - jwt 
 

can be simplified as
e - ð Þ σþa t
e - jwt 
 
 = e - ð Þ σþa t 
 
 e - jwt 
 
 → e - ð Þ σþa t 
 

For the integral in (6.14) to have a finite value,
e - ð Þ σþa t ð6:15Þ
must be a decreasing function. For e
-(σ+a)t
to be a decreasing function, we must have
σ þ a > 0 ð6:16Þ
which implies that Re{s} > -a. That is, for the convergence of the Laplace
transform, the condition Re{s} > -a must be satisfied.
Thus, (6.14) with the convergence condition (6.16) can be calculated as
X sð Þ =
Z1
t = 0
e - ð Þ sþa t
dt
= 1
s þ a Re f gs > - a
ð6:17Þ
The Fourier transform of the given signal can be calculated as
X wð Þ =
Z1
t = -1
x tð Þe - jwtdt
=
Z1
t = -1
e - atu tð Þe - jwtdt
=
Z1
t = 0
e - ate - jwtdt
=
Z1
t = 0
e - ð Þ aþjw t
dt
= 1
a þ jw a > 0
Thus, we see that the criteria for the existence of Laplace transform is Re{s} > - a
and the criteria for the existence of Fourier transform is a > 0.266 6 Laplace Transform
If a is a negative number, the Fourier transform cannot be calculated, whereas the
Laplace transform can be calculated since the Laplace transform condition can be
satisfied for some σ values. That is, some signals may not have Fourier transforms,
but the same signals may have Laplace transforms.
6.1.1 Convergence Region
In the previous section, we have seen that the condition for x(t) = e
-atu(t) to have
Laplace transform is that Re{s} > -a. Since s denotes a complex number, the
inequality Re{s} > -a indicates a region in the complex plane. This region is called
the convergence region of the Laplace transform, and Laplace transform has finite
value for the complex numbers falling into the convergence region.
For the regions outside the region of convergence, the Laplace integral diverges.
The region described by the inequality Re{s} > -a for a positive number a is
depicted in Fig. 6.1.
Example 6.2 Calculate the Laplace transform of x(t) = - e
-atu(-t).
Solution 6.2 Employing the Laplace transform formula
X sð Þ =
Z1
t = - 1

Theorem Laplace transform is a linear operation. That is, we have

L - 1
f g aF sð Þþ bG sð Þ = af tðÞþ bg tð Þ ð6:25Þ
where L and L - 1 indicate the Laplace and inverse Laplace transforms.
Note f(t) If the convergence region for the Laplace transform of f(t) is R1 and the
convergence for the Laplace transform of g(t) is R2, then the convergence region for
the Laplace transform of af(t) + bg(t) is R1 \ R2.
Note Some authors accept the s variable in
F sð Þ =
Z1
t = - 1
f tð Þe - stdt ð6:26Þ6.1 Laplace Transform 269
as a variable taking real values, and in this case, the convergence region of
x(t) = e
-atu(t) is indicated as s > -a different than Re{s} > -a used for
complex s parameter.
Example 6.5 f(t) = e

The convergence region of F(s) is obtained as
f g Re f gs > - 1 \ f g Re f gs > - 3 = Re f gs > - 1 ð6:28Þ
Hence we can write that

It is seen from the solution of this example that the Laplace transform is a mathe￾matical term in the form N sð Þ
D sð Þ and the boundaries of the convergence region are related
to the poles of the N sð Þ
D sð Þ rational expression.
The graph containing the locations of the zeros and poles of N sð Þ
D sð Þ is called pole￾zero graph. Let us give some properties of the convergence region and prove some of
these properties later on.
Right-Sided Function
If f(t) = 0, t < t0 and f(t) ≠ 0, t > t0, then f(t) is called a right-sided function.
Left-Sided Function
If f(t) = 0, t > t0 and f(t) ≠ 0, t < t0, then f(t) is called a left-sided function.
Two-Sided Function
If f(t) = 0 for t < t0 or t > t1 and f(t) ≠ 0 for t0 < t < t1, then f(t) is called a two-sided
function.
Property 1 The convergence region contains stripes parallel to the vertical axis.
Property 2 For rational Laplace transform functions N sð Þ, the convergence region D sð Þ
does not contain any poles of the transfer fuction.
Property 3 If f(t) is a right-sided function, the region of convergence of the Laplace
transform is denoted by Re{s} > σ0, and for rational Laplace transform functions,
the region of convergence is to the right side of the rightmost pole in the s plane.
Property 4 If f(t) is a left-sided function, the region of convergence of the Laplace
transform is denoted by Re{s} < σ0, and for rational Laplace transform functions,
the region of convergence is to the left side of the leftmost pole in the S plane.
Property 5 If f(t) is a two-sided function, the region of convergence of the Laplace
transform is denoted by σ0 < Re {s} < σ1, and for rational Laplace transform
functions, the region of convergence is the zone between the two innermost poles in
the s-plane.
Property 6 If the convergence region contains the imaginary axis, in addition to the
Laplace transform, the Fourier transform can also be calculated. If the convergence
region does not contain the imaginary axis, there is no Fourier transform, although
there is a Laplace transform.
Property 7 For Laplace transform polynomials, the plane of convergence is the
entire s-plane if there is at least one number in s-plane for which the Laplace
transform converges.6.1 Laplace Transform 277

Solution 6.16 Using the definition of absolute value, the function

where s = σ + jw. The integration in (6.69) is a complex integration, and it is not
used in practice; instead, known Laplace transform pairs are used for the calculation
of inverse Laplace transforms.
Example 6.18 The Laplace transform of f(t) is given as
F sð Þ = 1
ð Þ s þ 1 ð Þ s þ 3 , Re f gs > - 1 ð6:70Þ

where it seems at the first glance that F(s) has a pole at s = -a; however, if we put
s = -a in F(s), we get 0
0, and the value of F(s) at s = -a can be calculated using
L’Hospital’s rule as

are the poles of the transfer function.
The system with transfer function H(s) is causal if the region of convergence of
the Laplace transform lies to the right of the rightmost pole of H(s) in the complex
plane. The system is stable if the region of convergence of the transfer function
includes the vertical axis of the complex plane.
Hence, for a system to be both causal and stable, the real parts of all poles of the
transfer function must be negative, i.e., Re(si) < 0, i = 0...N, and the convergence
region must lie to the right of the rightmost pole covering the imaginary axis.
Example 6.29 The relationship between the input and output of a linear and time￾invariant system is expressed by the differential equation
dy tð Þ

Since the system is causal, the region of convergence must be to the right of the
rightmost pole in the complex plane.
There is only one pole at s = - 2, and the region of convergence can be indicated
as Re{s} > - 2. Considering the region of convergence, the expression of the
impulse function in the time can be calculated as

Solution 6.30 The poles of the transfer function can be found from (s + 3)
(s + 5) = 0 as s1 = -3, s2 = -5. Since the system is causal and stable, the
convergence region can be determined as Re{s} > -3.
The transfer function can be written as the sum of simpler polynomials as

Summary
The Laplace transform is used for continuous-time signals, and it is a more general
form of the continuous-time Fourier transform. Some signals may not have Fourier
transforms, whereas the same signals may have Laplace transforms.
The two-sided Laplace transform is calculated using
F sð Þ =
Z1
t = - 1
f tð Þe - stdt ð6:157Þ
whereas one-sided Laplace transform is calculated using
F sð Þ =
Z1
t = 0
f tð Þe - stdt ð6:158Þ
One-sided Laplace transform is used to solve differential equations. The Laplace
transforms of some of the basic signals used in signal processing are shown in
Table 6.1.
Let F(s) and G(s) be the Laplace transforms of f(t) and g(t). The regions of
converge for F(s) and G(s) are denoted by ROCf and ROCg, respectively.
The properties of the Laplace transform are summarized in Table 6.2. These
properties can be proved using the two-sided Laplace transform.
For the complex signal f(t), we have

Z Transform
In the previous chapter, we explained the Laplace transform. The Laplace transform
was a more general form of the Fourier transform of continuous-time signals. In a
similar manner, the Ζ transform can be considered as a more general form of the
Fourier transform used for digital signals. Discrete-time Fourier transforms of
impulse responses of linear time-invariant and unstable systems cannot be calcu￾lated, whereas Ζ transforms of impulse responses of the same systems can be
calculated. That is, the set of signals to which the Ζ transform can be applied includes
the set of signals to which the Fourier transform can be applied. In other words, the
Fourier transform is a subset of the Ζ transform. We cannot say that Ζ transform
necessarily exists for every signal. For some signals, the Ζ transform converges for
certain Ζ values. The region where the Ζ transform converges in the complex plane is
called the region of convergence. The Ζ transforms of two different signals can be
the same polynomial; however, the convergence regions may be different. In the
block diagram representation of digital communication systems, the Ζ transform
expression is generally used. The Ζ transform of the input signal, the transfer
function of the system, and the Ζ transform of the output of the system are used to
explain the operation of the system.
In the next section, we provide the definition of Ζ transform and the relationship
between Ζ transform and discrete-time Fourier transform. In succeeding sections, we
explain finding Ζ transform of some special signals and determination of their
convergence regions. Determining the properties of linear and time-invariant sys￾tems from the Z transform of their impulse functions is covered next. Inverse
Z transform is another topic covered in this chapter. Inverse Z transform is used to
find the function in time domain using its Z transform. Although the inverse Ζ
transform can be calculated using inverse Z transform formula, it is not a commonly
used formula. Instead, by using the known Ζ transforms by deliberation, the time
domain signal for which the inverse Ζ transform is desired is found. We also explain
the properties of the Ζ transform. All of these properties can be proved using the
definition of Z transform. Discrete-time linear and time-invariant systems can be

be solved using their Ζ transforms, and in sequel the impulse responses of these
systems can be determined. We will address this issue in the last part of the chapter.

7.1 Ζ Transform
The Ζ transform of the digital signal f[n] is calculated using

f n½ z - n ð7:1Þ
or using
F zð Þ = 1
ffiffiffiffiffi
2π p X1
n = - 1
f n½ z - n ð7:2Þ
where z is a complex variable. Ζ transform can be expressed using the pair
f n½ $Ζ F zð Þ ð7:3Þ
In this book, we will use the definition in (7.1) for the calculation of the
Z transform. z complex variable can be written as
z = j jz ejΩ ð7:4Þ
z complex variable can be indicated in the complex plane by a circle with a radius |z|
as shown in Fig. 7.1.

If we substitute z = |z|e jΩ in (7.1), we get
F zð Þ = P1
n = -1
f n½  j jz ejΩ ð Þ - n
= P1
n = -1
f n½ j jz - n ð Þe - jΩn
ð7:5Þ
where is seen that the Ζ transform of f[n] is nothing but the Fourier transform of
f[n]jzj
-n
. For jzj = 1, the Ζ transform equals the Fourier transform. Then the discrete￾time Fourier transform, i.e., digital Fourier transform, is a special case of Ζ transform
calculated on the unit circle. Hence, the Z transform can be expressed as
F zð Þ = FT f n½ j jz - n f g ð7:6Þ
where FT indicates the Fourier transform and the relationship between Fourier and
Z transforms can be expressed using
Fð Þ Ω = ðF zð Þj
z = ejΩ ð7:7Þ
The Z transform of f[n]
F zð Þ = X1
n = - 1
f n½ z - n ð7:8Þ
may not have a finite value, or it can be finite for a set of z numbers falling into an
interval. Determining the range of z values in which the Ζ transform of the f[n] takes
finite values is called finding the convergence region of the Ζ transform. The region
of convergence, ROC, of the Ζ transform is indicated by a circle in the complex
plane. If the convergence region includes the unit circle, then Fourier transform of
the signal also exists.
If the unit circle does not lie within the region of convergence, then although the Ζ
transform is available, the Fourier transform does not exist, i.e., it is divergent.
Example 7.1 Find the Ζ transform of f[n] = αn

the circle with radius α. In Fig. 7.2, the convergence region for α = 0.5 is shown.
It is seen from Fig. 7.2 that the convergence region for α = 0.5 encloses the unit

u[n] does not exist, i.e., it diverges.308 7 Z Transform

7.1.1 Properties of the Convergence Region
The convergence region of the Ζ transform has certain properties, and these proper￾ties can be listed as follows:
7.1 Ζ Transform 309
1. The region of convergence has an annular shape in the z plane.
2. There is no pole of the Ζ transform polynomial in the region of convergence.
3. If f[n] is a finite-length digital signal, the region of convergence is the entire
z plane or the entire z plane excluding z = 0 and z = 1.
4. For right-sided digital signals, the convergence regions of the Ζ transforms are
denoted either by jzj > z0 or by jzj  z0.
5. For left-sided digital signals, the convergence regions of the Ζ transforms are
denoted either by jzj < z0 or by jzj  z0.
6. For two-sided digital signals, the convergence regions of the Ζ transforms are
denoted either by 0 < jzj < z0 or by 0 < jzj  z0.
Example 7.4 Find the z transform and determine the region of convergence of
f n½  = αn 0  n < N, α > 0

When (7.20) is inspected, it is seen that F(z) has poles as z = 0 and z = a and the
convergence region is the entire z plane excluding the points z = 0 and z = α.
Example 7.5 Let h[n] be the impulse response of a linear time-invariant system.
Find the output of this system for the input x[n] = z
n where z is a complex variable.
Solution 7.5 The output of a linear time-invariant system with impulse response
h[n] for an arbitrary input x[n] can be calculated as
y n½  = X1
k = -1
h k½ x n½  - k
which can be calculated for the input signal x[n] = z
n as
y n½  = X1
k = - 1
h k½ z
n - k
= z
n X1
k = - 1
h k½ z - k

Thus, for a linear and time-invariant system with impulse response h[n], for input
x[n] = z

, the system output is y[n] = z

H(z) where H(z) is the Ζ transform of
h[n]. This property is illustrated in Fig. 7.4.
7.2 Inverse Ζ Transform
The inverse Ζ transform is used to find the digital sequence f[n] using its Z transform
F(z). To find f[n] a number of methods can be considered. In this section, we explain
how to find the inverse Z transform using different methods.7.2 Inverse Ζ Transform 311

be written as

Using Known Ζ Transform Pairs
It is a commonly used method to find the digital signal in the time domain from
its Ζ transform. In this method, the signal in the time domain is calculated using

Example 7.11 Find the Z transforms of f[n] = δ[n] and g[n] = δ[n - n0].

F zð Þ = P1
n = -1
f n½ z - n

n = -1
δ½  n z - n
where using the property
X1
n = -1
f n½ δ½  n - n0 = f n½  0
we obtain
F zð Þ = z
0 → F zð Þ = 1
In a similar manner, the Z transform of g[n] can be calculated as
G zð Þ = P1
n = -1
g n½ z - n

Polynomial Division or Polynomial Expansion
In this method, the digital signal is determined by comparing the definition of Ζ
transform formula to the polynomial expansion of the Z transform of the digital
signal. If the Ζ transform expression is a rational polynomial, division is performed
and written as the sum of the powers of z.
Example 7.12 X(z) = 3z

Note The polynomial division can also be achieved as

Initial Value Theorem
For causal f[n] signal, we have
f ½  0 = limz → 1F zð Þ ð7:62Þ
Proof The Z transform
F zð Þ = X1
n = 0
f n½ z - n
of the causal f [n], i.e., f [n] = 0, n < 0, F(z) can be written as

7.3 Z Transform of Linear and Time-Invariant Digital Systems 321
7.3 Z Transform of Linear and Time-Invariant Digital
Systems
The relationship between the output y[n] and the input x[n] of a digital system is
expressed as y[n] = x[n]  h[n] where h[n] is the impulse response of the system.
The Z transform of the output of the system can be written as
Y zð Þ = X zð ÞH zð Þ ð7:65Þ
from which we get
H zð Þ = Y zð Þ
X zð Þ ð7:66Þ
where H(z) is the Z transform of h[n] and it is called the transfer function of the
system. We can determine the other properties of a linear and time-invariant system
from its transfer function.
Causality Property
The criteria for a linear and time-invariant system to be causal is
h n½  = 0,n < 0 ð7:67Þ
If Z transform of h[n]
H zð Þ = X1
n = 0
h n½ z - n ð7:68Þ
is inspected considering the constraint (7.67), it is seen that H(z) contains only
negative powers of z, and the convergence region of H(z) extends to infinity.
We conclude that if the region of convergence of the transfer function of the
system is a region extending from the boundary of a circle toward infinity, then the
system has causal property.
Stability Property
The criteria for a linear and time-invariant system to be stable is
j j h n½  < 1 7:69Þ
If the impulse response of the system is absolutely summable, then the Fourier
transform of the impulse response of the system can be calculated. If the impulse
response of the system has a Fourier transform, this means that the convergence
region of the Ζ transform includes the unit circle. Hence, we can conclude that for alinear and time-invariant system to be a stable system, the convergence region of the
Z transform of the impulse response must include the unit circle.

The condition for a linear and time-invariant system to be causal and stable is that
the convergence region of the Ζ transform of the impulse response must include the
unit circle and it must cover a region extending to infinity. The convergence region
of a linear and time-invariant system having causality and stability properties is
depicted in Fig. 7.5.

Practical Applications
In this chapter, we consider a practical topic as an application of the topics we covered
in the previous chapters. Although students think of many of the signal processing
subjects they learn in theoretical courses only as mathematical expressions, almost all
of them have application areas. In this chapter, we first consider an example applica￾tion of the subjects we learned. Secondly, we will describe the development of the fast
Fourier transform algorithm as an example for scientific work.
Formulas or algorithms that require too much processing are impractical for real￾time applications since they consume too much processing time for computer
implementations. Today’s computers can run faster than their old counterparts.
Algorithms, which were considered useless 30 or 40 years ago for computer
implementations due to large latency, are today used in practical applications.
Scientists are constantly trying to achieve improved techniques by reducing the
complexity of invented techniques. Today, many countries are in a position to
produce mobile phones. But applying rough technology alone is not enough for
the device produced to hold on to the market. Devices produced with improved
techniques may bring one to an advantageous position compared to the original
owners of the technique.
After the Second World War, with the use of the first computer, many electronic
circuits, which were mainly designed as hardware, began to be designed as software.
Although hardware-designed circuits run faster than software ones, recent advances
in microprocessor technology have caused software-intensive designs to come to the
forefront compared to hardware-intensive ones. With the prominence of software,
researchers have worked to reduce the amount of mathematical computation
required by existing algorithms. Algorithms whose complexities are reduced by
scientific methods are used in practical applications. Discrete Fourier transform is
one of the most important topics of signal processing, and it is used in many practical
applications. Fast Fourier transform Goertzel and Chirp algorithms, which require
less processing, have been developed to calculate the discrete Fourier transform
faster. In this chapter, we explain Goertzel and fast Fourier transform algorithms. We
consider the detection of dual-tone multi-frequencies using the Goertzel algorithm.

8.1 Computational Complexity of the Discrete Fourier
Transform Algorithm and Complexity Reduction
Computational Complexity
For the computation of
x2 þ xy ð8:1Þ
we need to perform:
1. x
2 = xx, one multiplication
2. xy, one multiplication
3. x
2 + xy, one addition
Thus, in total, two multiplications and one addition, i.e., three operations are
performed.
The expression x
2 + xy can be written as
x xð Þ þ y 8:2Þ
and for the computation of (8.2), we need:
1. x + y, one addition
2. x(x + y), one multiplication
Hence, two operations are needed for the calculation of (8.2).
It is seen that we can calculate the same mathematical expression with fewer
operations. A similar logic is used for the calculation of discrete Fourier transform.
Discrete Fourier transform is calculated using

where f[k] is a complex digital sequence. For the easiness of the notation, let us use

where for each k value there are N complex multiplication operations and N - 1
complex addition operations. For all the k values, 0  k < N, there are N2 complex
multiplication and N(N - 1) complex addition operations. The total number of
arithmetic operations is N2 + N(N - 1) which can be approximated as 2N2 for
very large N values. Thus we can conclude that the total amount of computation for
the calculation of the Fourier transform is proportional to N2
.
8.1 Computational Complexity of the Discrete Fourier Transform Algorithm... 343
The amount of calculation required for the calculation of the Fourier transform
can be reduced. The complex signals f[n] and ekn
N appearing in (8.4) can be written as

N = Re ekn

expressions. Substituting (8.5) into (8.4), we obtain

ð8:6Þ
In (8.6), for each value of k, the number of multiplications is 4N, and the number
of additions is 4N - 2.
The number of addition operations required for n = 0 is 2. For other n values,
namely, n = 1, 2, ..., the number of additions is 2 for the complex number of the
current n value, but this complex number is added to the previous summations;
hence, the total number of addition operations becomes 4. If we consider all k values,
there are 4N addition operations.
However, since there is no complex number before n = 0, the complex number at
n = 0 is not added with the previous one; hence, the total number of addition
operations is 4N - 2.
To reduce the amount of total computation, the properties of the exponential
signal ekn
N can be used. The exponential signal ekn
N has the properties

where the number of multiplication operations is halved.
Since the expression ekn
N is a sinusoidal expression, it equals 0 or 1 for some
n values. These values do not need to be multiplied, which contributes to reducing
the amount of processing
Fast Fourier transform was developed to calculate the discrete Fourier transform
quickly. When the frequency range is taken from 0 to 2π, the Goertzel algorithm is
more efficient than the fast Fourier transform.
8.2 GoertzelAlgorithm
The Goertzel algorithm was invented in 1958 to decrease the computational com￾plexity of the discrete Fourier transform algorithm. This algorithm is used to detect
dual-tone multi-frequencies, DTMF, used in telephones.
Now let us explain the derivation of the algorithm. Discrete Fourier transform is

The recursive expression in (8.18) involves a complex multiplication expression
which increases the overhead of the processes in practical applications. To alleviate
the overhead created by the complex multiplication, we can manipulate the transfer

where initial conditions are vk[-2] = vk[-1] = 0.
In (8.21), there is one real multiplication and a single addition operation, and
complex multiplication is performed for only i = N. Thus, equations in (8.21) are
more suitable for practical applications. After calculation of yk[n] in (8.21), the
Fourier series coefficients are evaluated using

8.3 Dual-Tone Multi-frequency (DTMF) Detection Using

Dual-tone multi-frequency, DTMF, was first developed in American Bell Labora￾tories. Today, this system is used by many communication devices.ð

The digits represented by DTMF signals are depicted in Fig. 8.6. In the DTMF
standard, the tone duration must be at least 40 ms which is taken into account when
electronic devices generating DTMF tones are produced. For instance, the signal
representing the digit “5” is
c1 sin 2ð Þþ π × 770 × t c2 sin 2ð Þ π × 1336 × t 8:23Þ
which must have a duration of at least 40 ms. The coefficients in (8.23) can be chosen
as c1 = c2 = 1
2.
On the receiver side, the key pressed on the transmitter is determined.Different
methods can be used to detect the key pressed. Before the detection operation, the
received tone is sampled.
The sampling frequency used for telephone speech is Fs = 8 kHz. As it is
mentioned before, DTMF tone duration must be at least 40 ms. The number of
samples taken from a tone of 40 ms duration can be calculated as 40 × 10-
3 × 8000 = 320. The generation of the tone corresponding to the digit “1” using
MATLAB is performed in Prog 8.1 where the sampling frequency is taken as 8 kHz
and tone duration is chosen as 100 ms.

8.3 Dual-Tone Multi-frequency (DTMF) Detection Using Goertzel Algorithm 349
The tone graph corresponding to digit “1” is displayed in Fig. 8.7.
The duration of the signal generated on the transmitter side is 100 ms, which
corresponds to 800 samples when the sampling frequency is chosen as 8 kHz. Not all
of these 800 samples need to be used on the receiver side for tone detection. The
researchers showed that the use of 205 samples at the receiver side for a sampling
frequency of 8 kHz minimizes the minimum mean square detection error. In other
words, it will be sufficient to use only 205 out of 800 samples on the receiver side.
This means that the signal with a duration of approximately 25 ms is sufficient for the
detection process.
Although the transmitter knows which signal it is sending, this information is not
available to the receiver. On the receiver side, different methods can be followed to
determine the key pressed. One of these methods is as follows. The absolute value of
the discrete Fourier transform coefficients at the receiver is calculated for each
frequency value, i.e., for each “k” value, we calculate

Fig. 8.7 Tone graph corresponding to digit “1”and the numbers “k”giving the highest values and their corresponding frequencies
are determined. By inspecting the selected frequencies, the key pressed is deter￾mined. However, the complexity of this method is high. Instead, the Goertzel
algorithm, which has less complexity and allows us to get the results faster, is used.
350 8 Practical Applications
The steps of tone detection with the Goertzel algorithm are as follows:
First, the “k” values corresponding to eight frequencies used on the telephone
keypad are determined as follows.

where the “k” value is obtained for a frequency value and the sampling frequency is

corresponding frequency value is calculated as
k

→ f = Fs

For sampling frequency Fs = 8 kHz and N = 205, the “k” values corresponding to
the frequencies on the telephone keypad can be calculated using MATLAB code in
Prog. 8.2 where the formula k = N f
Fs is implemented, and Table 8.1 is obtained.8.3 Dual-Tone Multi-frequency (DTMF) Detection Using Goertzel Algorithm 351

1. In the second step, for each “k” value found in the first step, the discrete Fourier
transform coefficients at the receiver are calculated using the Goertzel algorithm.
2. In the third step, the absolute value of the discrete Fourier transform calculated for
each “k” value is checked, and the two largest “k” values are recorded. Then, the
frequencies corresponding to the recorded “k” values are found, and the numbers
corresponding to these two frequencies on the keypad are determined. Let’s
explain how the tone corresponding to the “1” is detected using the third step.
In order to find out which key was pressed, the sampled data atthe receiver is

The graph obtained using Prog. 8.4 is depicted in Fig. 8.8. If we examine this
graph carefully, we see that the absolute value of the discrete Fourier transform takes
large values for k = 18 and k = 31.8.3 Dual-Tone Multi-frequency (DTMF) Detection Using Goertzel Algorithm 353
Fig. 8.8 Plot of absolute DFT values for different frequencies
The frequencies corresponding to these “k” values are 702 and 1210, and the
frequencies closest to these values on the keypad are 697 and 1209, which corre￾sponds to the digit “1” on the keypad.
A question may come to the reader’s mind as follows:
Question:
“We already know the frequencies corresponding to the ‘k’ values for the keypad, so
why are we calculating approximate frequency values again.”
Answer:
We explained the general situation. If the communication system had used more
frequencies and not just the frequencies on the keypad, then it would be impractical
to store all frequencies in memory corresponding to the “k” value for high N values.
For these reasons, the frequencies corresponding to the “k” values determined as a
result of the detection process can be found approximately with the expression
f = Fs
k
N
In order for the estimated frequency value not to be too far from the original
frequency value, a fraction of the total number of samples taken by the receiver is
chosen to minimize the amount of mean square error between the estimatedfrequencies and the original frequency. In our example, on the receiver side, it is
sufficient to use Nt = 205 samples out of N = 800 received samples to make an
accurate estimation.
354 8 Practical Applications
In the example, we considered the transmission of digit “1.” The detection of
other digits can be achieved in a similar manner. In the calculation of the discrete
Fourier transform, the “k” values range from 0 to (N - 1). In the Goertzel algorithm,
only some “k” values are used, as we mentioned in the previous pages. For
sequences of small length, the Goertzel algorithm is more efficient, whereas, for
longer sequences, the fast Fourier transform algorithm is more effective.
8.4 Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
The method used in the development of the fast Fourier transform algorithm is
based on some properties of the complex exponential signal. The complex expo￾nential signal used in the Fourier transform is eN = e - j
2π
N from which we can write
ekn
N = e - j
2π
N kn.
The period of the complex exponential signal is N, that is, ekn
N = e - j
2π
N kn .
If f kð Þ = ekn
N , then we have f(k) = f(k + N).
Example 8.1 Find the period of g kð Þ = e - j
π
3kn.
Solution 8.1 The expression e - j
π
3kn can be written as e - j
2π
3 kn from which theperiod is
found as 6.

where there are N2 multiplication and addition operations.
Our aim is to do less multiplication and addition while calculating (8.31). Less
computational complexity allows the calculations to be done faster by the processors
and causes an increase in the data rate. Two different methods can be followed to
decrease the computation amount. The first method is called decimation in time, and
the second is called decimation in frequency. The computational gain of these two
methods is the same. In this section, we will only explain the decimation in time
method.
Decimation in Time
We will make use of the exponential signal ekn
N to reduce the number of operations in
the calculation of (8.31). Let us examine the period of the exponential signal for the
cases k = 2m and k = 2m + 1; for k = 2m we have8.4 Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) 355

Two-Point Discrete Fourier Transform
Since N-point Fourier transform is written as the sum of 2-point Fourier transforms,
let us first obtain the flow graph of the 2-point Fourier transform and, then, express
the flow graph of the bigger point Fourier transforms using the flow graph of 2-point
Fourier transforms. Two-point Fourier transform calculation can be performed using8.4 Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) 357
