Nonrecursive Control 
Design for Nonlinear 
Systems
Based on the authors’ recent advances, this book focuses on a class of nonlinear systems with 
mismatched uncertainties/disturbances and discusses their typical control problems. It aims 
to provide a comprehensive view of the nonrecursive control theory and application guidelines.
Nonrecursive synthesis of complex nonlinear systems not only greatly simplify the control 
design process, weaken the system assumptions, and reduce the conservatism of gain selec￾tion, but also realize the essential detachment of control law design and Lyapunov func￾tion-based stability analysis. Therefore, different from the classical recursive control design 
methods, it is of significance to study the synthesis of nonlinear systems from the perspective 
of a new nonrecursive control framework.
This book discusses the following typical control problems: theoretical background, homo￾geneous systems theory review, nonrecursive robust control design, nonrecursive adaptive 
control design, nonrecursive generalized dynamic predictive control, disturbance estimation 
and attenuation, nonrecursive stability analysis, implementation theory and real-life applica￾tions to series elastic actuators, DC microgrids, and permanent magnet synchronous motor 
(PMSM) systems under the proposed nonrecursive synthesis framework.
This book will be a great reference for scholars and students in the field of automation and 
control. It will also be a useful source for control engineers and those working on anti-dis￾turbance control, nonlinear output regulation, nonsmooth control, and other related topics.

xixPreface
For nonlinear systems, finding an effective controller to keep the closed-loop
control system stable at the working equilibrium is the primary goal of con￾trol. Moreover, it is also necessary to consider the performance indexes such as
improving the robustness, convergence rate, regulation accuracy, and economy
issue of the control system. For nearly half a century, there have been many sys￾tematic nonlinear controller design methods for different types of systems in the
literature, which have attracted extensive attention from both the academic com￾munity and industrial practitioners, such as backstepping, sliding mode control,
adding a power integrator, predictive control, disturbance/uncertainty estima￾tion, and attenuation control. These nonlinear control technologies have already
achieved rich research results in the theoretical field, and they have improved the
performance of the control system from different points of view. Notably, for a
wide class of nonlinear systems, control law derived from a recursive design pro￾cedure is one of the most common strategies, such as backstepping and adding
a power integrator method. However, recursive design usually shows some dis￾advantages such as complex controller expression, large amount of calculation,
and difficulty in selecting control parameters. Especially for high-order nonlin￾ear systems, the phenomenon of “explosion of complexity” in control design is
well acknowledged as a hurdle for practical implementation.
Considering the synthesis for linear systems in modern control theory, non￾recursive control design is a very common fashion and has gained successful
applications. However, nonrecursive control design issue for nonlinear systems
is indeed a non-trivial task. Therefore, a natural conjecture is:
For a class of n-order general nonlinear systems with the presence of uncer￾tainties/disturbances, can a nonrecursive control design framework be proposed
to greatly reduce the complexity of controller design and enhance the facility of
engineering applications?
xxixxii  Preface
Focusing on the above problem, in recent years, based on several powerful
tools such as homogeneous system theory, the authors have been continually
working on how to discover a new nonrecursive synthesis framework for non￾linear systems to narrow the gap between advanced control theory and applica￾tions. Numerous research results on the nonrecursive control theory and applica￾tion studies have been built. Various applications on the nonrecursive synthesis
of complex nonlinear systems can not only greatly simplify the control design
process, weaken the system assumptions and reduce the conservatism of gain
selection, but also realize the essential detachment of control law design and
Lyapunov function-based stability analysis. Therefore, different from the clas￾sical recursive control design method, it is of great theoretical and engineering
significance to study the synthesis of nonlinear systems from the perspective of
a new nonrecursive control framework.
Based on a series of recent advances achieved by the authors, this book will
present the control theory and application communities with a comprehensive
view of the nonrecursive control theory and application guidelines. It will not
only enrich the existing nonlinear control theory but also depict an alternative
practically oriented synthesis procedure with abundant practice experiences.
This book can be referred to as a reference for graduate students with a basic
knowledge of classical control theory and some knowledge of the state-space
control design methods and nonlinear systems. For control engineers, we have
also provided a few practical case studies, which present the results of how we
can implement the proposed methods into practices. Those examples are used to
illustrate the successful practical application of the nonlinear control theory.
This book is structured as follows.
Chapter 1 reviews the recent advances in nonlinear control methods for non￾linear systems with the presence of uncertainties/disturbances. By presenting a
few case studies, it is shown that even various existing methods have been in￾vestigated in the past few decades; however, those results may leave a big gap
between theoretical justification and practical simplification requirements. No￾tably, with the famous backstepping control strategy it is easy to cause an “ex￾plosion of terms” phenomenon. Motivated by these facts, Chapter 1 will show
a clear motivation of why the practitioners have a demand for simpler nonlinear
controller construction procedures, especially for those systems requiring an ac￾curate steady-state error and a strong disturbance/uncertainty attenuation ability.
Chapter 2 addresses the robust stabilization issue for a class of nonlinear
systems with internal uncertainties. Different from existing recursive-based con￾trol strategies, this chapter presents a novel homogeneous controller construction
framework. By opposing a series of nonlinearity constraints, one is now able to
derive a nonrecursive stabilizing control law for a class of uncertain nonlinear
systems without going through a series of virtual controller calculations. In ad￾dition, now the controller construction is essentially detached from the stabil-Preface  xxiii
ity analysis. With an illustrative example, the efficacy is verified by numerical
simulations.
Chapter 3 discusses the nonrecursive tracking control for nonlinear systems
via both state-feedback and output feedback. In order to release the nonlinearity
constraints generally opposed to the system in the existing nonsmooth control
design framework, we develop a simple practically oriented finite-time control
framework, to essentially remove any nonlinearity growth conditions under a
less ambitious but very practical semi-global control objective. With abundant
numerical simulations, the efficacy of the new nonrecursive robust tracking con￾trol design methods is illustrated.
Chapter 4 further addresses the adaptive control problem for a class of nonlin￾ear systems with non-parameterized uncertainties. Noting that existing adaptive
methods, such as adaptive backstepping, require very complex tuning functions
to avoid the overparameterization problem, this chapter presents an alternative
adaptive control design framework under a nonrecursive synthesis manner. By
dividing the control objective into state feedback and output feedback cases, a
unified smooth and nonsmooth control framework is presented. It is shown that
under a semi-global control objective, one can unify the adaptive control within
an identical design framework while the control performance is dependent on
the selection of homogeneous degrees. At last, a few illustrative examples with
numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and theoretical justification.
Chapter 5 discusses the robust output regulation problem for a class of non￾linear systems perturbed by a series of mismatched disturbances. By integrating
the output regulation theory and homogeneous domination method, now it is
able to derive a very simple exact tracking controller without going through any
complex calculations and virtual controller determination steps. The key factor
in this algorithm is based on a delicate handling process of the nonlinearity and
disturbance terms. For the mismatched disturbances, this book has also provided
a few disturbance estimation tools, including higher-order sliding mode (HOSM)
observer and nonsmooth extended state observer. Simulation comparison studies
are conducted to show how the control parameters are configured and how can
different homogeneous degree relates to the system control performance.
Chapter 6 further studies the nonrecursive adaptive output regulation problem
for a class of nonlinear systems with the presence of mismatched disturbances.
Different with the robust control method in Chapter 5, by adding a one-step dy￾namic gain tuning mechanism, the possible robustness redundancy issue caused
by the gain selection guideline can be essentially avoided. Moreover, the adap￾tive output regulation strategy could also maintain an improved transient-time
control performance for different variation levels of the disturbances. With rigor￾ous stability proof, both semi-global attractivity and local asymptomatic/finite￾time convergence rate can be ensured under the proposed controller. Illustrative
examples and numerical simulation results have confirmed the performance im￾provement compared to the existing related robust control methods.xxiv  Preface
The above theoretical results have enriched the nonlinear control theory;
however, the main motivation of this research is to facilitate practitioners and
give them an alternative control design choice when they are dealing with some
complicated real-life nonlinear systems. As such, the following chapters are ded￾icated to presenting several application examples to demonstrate the implemen￾tation simplicity and user-friendly features.
Chapter 7 presents the implementation of related nonrecursive smooth and
nonsmooth controllers into the speed regulation or position control problems for
permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) systems. This type of system
is generally employed to test the control performances of different control ad￾vances. By conducting the experimental tests on a laboratory platform, the con￾trol performances under different related controllers, the proposed nonsmooth
controllers have shown their superiority in several control performance indexes.
More specifically, we have also provided the parameter configuration details in
order to give the engineers a typical experience if they are trying to apply the
methods from this book to other real-life systems.
Chapter 8 shows the application of the nonrecursive controller design with a
nonsmooth functional form to a series elastic actuator, which is widely applied in
compliant robotic systems. First, the modeling procedure of the system is given
to show the physical meaning of those control variables. Then by applying the
robust control strategy into these practical systems, both simulation study and ex￾perimental verification are conducted. More specifically, what is interesting here
is that a flexible homogeneous degree can make a serious impact on the control
performance, hence providing the control engineering with a novel fractional
power tuning procedure.
Chapter 9 gives a comprehensive application example of how we extend the
theoretical method into the control practices of DC microgrid systems. These
types of systems are strongly dependent on new nonlinear control methods ow￾ing to the fact that there are more and more constant power loads (CPLs) in the
practical DC microgrids, and they normally have a negative impedance charac￾teristic. By successfully applying our methods into the decentralized stabilization
problem for DC microgrid systems, it is shown that a large-signal stability can be
ensured by the proposed methods. Experimental results have validated our theo￾retical conjecture. Moreover, some extension results have also been presented to
show the performance improvements and implementation facilities.About the Authors

Introduction
1.1 Overview of Nonlinear System Control
For different kinds of nonlinear systems with uncertainties and internal/external
disturbances, the primary objective of system control design is to find an effective
controller to keep the closed-loop control system stable at the operating point.
Second, it is also necessary to consider improving the robustness, rapidity, ac￾curacy, economy, and other performance indicators of the control system. More
specifically, for a class of nonlinear systems with lower triangular structures, it
is of special interest owing to its structural feature which supports a systematic
controller design procedure. In this regard, many successful nonlinear controller
design methods have been investigated in the literature. Back to the 1990s, back￾stepping method, which performs as a milestone tool bringing into the nonlinear
control community, has stimulated a long-lasting bloom of research interests in
nonlinear control systems [1, 32, 35, 97]. Therefore, different classes of nonlin￾ear systems are extensively studied for different control issues. However, there
are several clear drawbacks in most of the existing backstepping-based control
approaches, which can be summarized in the following aspects.
 First, the nominal system considered should be restrained as a feedback
linearizable structure, and hence system smoothness and triangular struc￾ture are always required.
 Second, the system internal nonlinearities are usually canceled recur￾sively via feedback linearization; hence, the closed-loop system will be￾have only with linear or quasi-linear dynamics.
DOI: 10.1201/9781003399230-1 12  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
 Third, due to the recursive design, the virtual controllers usually contain
abundant partial derivative terms that add much complexity and difficulty
to be realized for practical implementations.
Therefore, backstepping-based control methods commonly have some draw￾backs to hinder the industrial applications of the controller, especially, for high￾order nonlinear systems, it is prone to the phenomenon of “explosion of com￾plexity” in the control design.
On the one hand, aiming to release the “explosion of complexity” phe￾nomenon of backstepping control methods, abundant extension results have been
achieved in recent decades based on the core recursive synthesis idea of back￾stepping, such as Dynamic Surface Control (DSC) [74], Neural Network Con￾trol [50, 52], other related intelligent control methods [25, 98], etc.
On the other hand, for a class of inherent nonlinear systems, a common sin￾gularity problem of the backstepping design often leads to the failure of the
recursive design method. Therefore, in order to improve the defects of the tra￾ditional backstepping method, by employing a “feedback domination” concept,
rather than the “feedback cancellation” manner in backstepping design, a series
of novel nonlinear design methods have been successively studied, aiming to
solve the global asymptotic or finite-time control problems for a wider class of
inherent nonlinear systems. As one representative method, adding a power inte￾grator (API) method has successfully expanded the range of nonlinear systems
that can be stabilized via recursive design by improving the singularity defect of
adding a linear integrator in the backstepping method, see, for instances, [43,61]
and references therein.
As mentioned above, there are numerous new control design methods have
been reported in the literature, they are able to release the controller design com￾plexity and extend the applicability of backstepping methods to some extent.
However, it is worthy of pointing out here that these methods still inherit a re￾cursive design procedure, leading to the fact that: 1) the virtual controllers are
unavoidable and the controller design cannot be essentially detached from the
stability analysis; 2) large computational burden of the allowable control gains
or adaption functions; and 3) difficulty in selecting control parameters, especially
for high-order systems.
Recall that the nonrecursive design manner is very common for the synthe￾sis problems of linear systems and widely welcomed by control practitioners.
However, most of the existing literature on advanced nonlinear control design
may disobey the beauty of simplicity, and hence when control engineers try to
implement those enormous nonlinear controllers, a series of costly calculations
have to be tackled first in order to proceed. As a consequence, control engineers
will finally return to simple PID controllers or state-feedback controllers via lo￾cal linearization methods, etc. Therefore, for a class of n-order lower triangular
nonlinear systems, designing a novel nonrecursive control design framework,
which could significantly reduce the complexity of controller form, the difficultyIntroduction  3
of control gain selection, and thereby facilitate the implementation in industrial
applications, will be of great significance in both control theory and industrial
applications.
Since the 1980s, the homogeneous system theory has attracted extensive at￾tention from the system and control community. Note that homogeneous dy￾namical systems, which take an intermediate between linear and nonlinear sys￾tems, have been extensively studied where many significant characteristics are
revealed [21, 62]. These features have provided a promising conclusion that
weighted homogeneity introduced into nonlinear system synthesis issues will
significantly ease or facilitate the design procedure. Through the in-depth study
of the homogeneous system theory, many new-fashioned nonlinear theoretical
directions, such as adding a power integrator method [43], the homogeneous
domination method [58], the higher-order sliding mode control algorithm [12]
and others, have obtained fruitful research results.
A pioneer work [4] presents a novel simple finite-time controller and a non￾recursive proof for the chain of integrators, and a later result [54] designs a full￾order finite-time observer for the chain of integrators as well. A study [49] pro￾vides an explicit homogeneous feedback controller with the requirement that a
control Lyapunov function exists for an affine control system and satisfies a ho￾mogeneous condition. Based on an adding a power integrator design, an interest￾ing result in [55] reports a homogeneous domination technique that can handle
a wide class of inherent nonlinear systems within one unified framework, while
the controller can be designed in a nested form which will be much easier to be
realized.
On the basis of the above-mentioned systematic recursive design methods and
tools, for a class of lower-triangular nonlinear systems with matched/mismatched
uncertainties/disturbances, numerous scholars have carried out related research
from different perspectives of robust control and adaptive control. Some main
research results are described as follows.
Robust control is a commonly widely applied strategy when the system is
perturbed by mismatched disturbances. In [59], based on the homogeneous dom￾ination method, the authors propose a state feedback control law design method
under an almost disturbance decoupling manner. Soon after, this robust control
approach is generalized to the case of output feedback tracking in [20]. Regard￾ing the disturbance processing, the above algorithms can usually be viewed as
passive disturbance rejection techniques, and the regulation control objective of
the system is achieved via a large control energy consumption. Another common
design scheme is to combine the disturbance estimation and feedforward decou￾pling technology to handle the internal and external uncertainties/disturbances of
the system, which is also called as “active disturbance attenuation control strat￾egy”. The advantage of this method lies in the real-time observation and com￾pensation of disturbances. Therefore, the controller can relieve the problem of
robustness redundancy while ensuring the control performance of the system. In4  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
the related literature, combining recursive control design techniques and active
anti-disturbance methods, the robust control design problem for a class of mis￾matched disturbed systems has also been widely studied in recent years. Taking
the finite-time control problem as an example, the works in [39, 86] realize the
finite-time tracking control of a class of mismatched disturbed linear and nonlin￾ear systems by combining the adding power integral method and the high-order
sliding mode observation technique, respectively.
As is well acknowledged to all, in contrast to the robust control method, the
adaptive control strategy can self-configure the control parameters under differ￾ent working conditions, thereby improving the transient-time performance of the
control system. In the existing literature, great progress has been made in the
research on adaptive control of nonlinear systems with parametric uncertainties,
such as the traditional adaptive backstepping method. However, it is noted that
the non-parametric uncertainties (also called nonlinearly-parameterized uncer￾tainties) exist more widely in practical nonlinear systems. In the past few years,
for a class of nonlinear systems with non-parametric uncertainties, the adaptive
control method has also received continuous attention from the control commu￾nity. Notably, combined with the homogeneous system theory, the accompanying
tuning functions in the adaptive backstepping method are extended to the nons￾mooth case, and a category of nonsmooth adaptive control design methods can
be obtained, such as [22, 44, 81]. However, such methods usually require a large
number of mathematical scaling methods to estimate the nonlinear terms of the
system, resulting in the self-tuning gain functions are possibly relatively conser￾vative, and moreover, it is hard to construct these gain functions in practice.
In the literature, another indirect adaptive control design concept can also be
found from the perspective of a self-tuned high gain design. For example, in [34],
a class of feedback controllers with dynamic high gain has been designed to
adaptively handle the nonparametric uncertainties. In [71] and [46], the recursive
finite-time adaptive control law of this kind of system is developed by designing
different dynamic gain self-renewal mechanisms and combining with the adding
a power integrator method.
If we consider the application design and implementation issues, the ad￾vanced nonlinear control algorithms based on some of the methods mentioned
above have also achieved some research results. From the perspective of theo￾retical research on sampling control implementation, it is of great significance
for the realization of control algorithms to perform fixed-frequency or variable￾frequency sampling analysis for nonlinear control systems. Taking the homoge￾neous control system as an example, the works [14, 68] analyze the quantitative
relationship between the sampling period and the system stability for homoge￾neous control systems, and the realization mechanism of fixed frequency sam￾pling is given. From the perspective of platform application, abundant applica￾tion design schemes based on finite-time control algorithms for some specific
practical engineering plants are reported, such as the spacecraft attitude controlIntroduction  5
problem [95], the trajectory tracking control problem of surface vehicles [79],
permanent magnet synchronous motor speed control problem [16], etc.
To sum up, although the research on nonlinear robust/adaptive control
methodologies has achieved relatively fruitful results, it is worth noting that the
current control design thoughts in the literature are mainly based on recursive
design, hence it is similar to the backstepping method, the problems of compli￾cated selection of control parameters, cumbersome recursive design process and
a huge amount of calculation cannot be avoided in essence. Additionally, the ex￾isting nonsmooth control design methods usually require restrictive constraints
on the nonlinear terms of the system, such as the commonly considered Holder ¨
continuity requirements. As a consequence, practical implementations may still
face a dilemma that the prior assumptions are very difficult to be verified, result￾ing in a questionable application potential.
The above problems also directly hinder the widespread application of these
advanced nonlinear control algorithms in practical engineering. Oriented to prac￾tical engineering application, how to upgrade these deficiencies is also one of the
topical issues in the field of nonlinear control theory research in recent years.
1.2 Overview of Nonrecursive Control Design for Non￾linear Systems
In order to simplify the nonlinear controller design procedure, reduce the dif￾ficulty of parameter selection, and relax the nonlinear constraints, some re￾searchers have launched related research from the perspective of nonrecursive
control design recently. The most immediate strength of this type of approach
over the aforementioned recursive control methods is that the controller design
can often be substantially separated from the Lyapunov function-based stability
analysis.
For a chain of integrator systems, by introducing the homogeneous sys￾tem theory, the work in [4] proposes a novel nonrecursive control design idea,
meanwhile, provides a nonrecursive stability analysis approach. Later on, based
on the result in [4], a class of homogeneous nonrecursive state observers are
successively proposed in [54, 67], including the global/semi-global finite-time
stability analysis. For a class of lower triangular systems with the presence of
high-order nonlinearities, by introducing an enhanced homogeneous domination
control strategy, a novel nonrecursive control method is proposed in [91], which
realizes the design and integration of the controller, and is essentially detached
from stability analysis based on the indirect Lyapunov method. This strategy
can directly achieve the expression of the control law according to the struc￾ture of the control system, without designing a series of virtual controllers and
recursive Lyapunov functions. The controller has the characteristics of simple
controller form and easy selection of control gains. However, the global design6  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
still needs to oppose certain Holder continuity constraints on the nonlinear terms ¨
of the system. Subsequently, based on the nonrecursive design framework of
the homogeneous system approach, a class of output feedback controllers with
a nonrecursive structure is achieved in [92] by setting a more practical control
objective, namely semi-global stability. Referring to a recent result in [96], by
utilizing homogeneous system theory, the authors present a nonrecursive method
to design finite-time output feedback control laws for nonlinear systems, and ap￾ply it to the control issue for a class of single-degree-of-freedom manipulators.
However, these methodologies usually have higher requirements for the accuracy
of the control system model. When there exist internal parameter uncertainties
(especially those non-parameterized uncertainties) and external disturbances in
the system, a more conservative robust control strategy is usually adopted, that
is, ensuring the steady-state error of the system to meet the design requirements
via selecting a larger set of control gain parameters.
Furthermore, for a class of nonlinear systems with the presence of mis￾matched disturbances, rather than commonly seen matched disturbances, realiz￾ing precise decoupling of disturbances and developing higher performance out￾put regulation schemes for such systems is never a trivial problem. In recent
decades, there are also a number of results in the literature focusing on how to
investigate the exact tracking control problem for such systems based on nonre￾cursive synthesis strategies. Aiming to solve the problem of nonsmooth output
regulation for a class of nonlinear systems disturbed by time-varying mismatched
disturbances, a finite-time output regulation control law for such systems is
achieved [93]. Through employing a higher-order sliding mode observer for ac￾curate disturbance estimation and subsequently decoupling the disturbances by
the feedforward manner, a new framework of nonrecursive design is presented.
However, in order to guarantee the absolute stability of the control system even
in the sense of semi-global stability, the developed output regulation law has a
certain degree of robustness redundancy, which may easily lead to problems such
as undesirable transient-time performance of the control system under different
initial conditions or different levels of disturbances.
For uncertain nonlinear systems, a typical handling strategy in the literature
is to introduce a neural-network approximation or high-order sliding mode ob￾servation process to mitigate the complexity caused by recursive adaptive de￾sign [25, 50, 52, 98]. In [98], by employing the neural network and dynamic sur￾face control method, a novel adaptive nonrecursive design idea is proposed to
avoid the common “explosion of complexity” problem in recursive approaches.
In the case when the output of the system has certain constraints, integrating
neural network and high-gain observation technology, a class of nonrecursive
adaptive output feedback control law can be referred to [25]. Based on the ho￾mogeneous system theory, the nonrecursive robust control design method pro￾posed in the work [91] is extended to the case of nonrecursive adaptive con￾trol design in [89], and a new type of continuously differentiable homogeneousIntroduction  7
adaptive control is proposed. Without recursively constructing a series of tuning
functions and virtual controllers, the self-tuning gain mechanism is indirectly de￾signed to obtain the updating configuration of the dynamic gain in the controller
expression.
From the above literature review, it is clear to find out that: although nonrecur￾sive control has been very common in the synthesis problems of linear systems,
the research results of nonrecursive control problems for nonlinear systems in the
literature are still very few, and the related design frameworks, analysis methods,
and application design are not yet matured. In this regard, the initiative of this
book is to summarize the existing related results from the authors to present a
partial implementable nonrecursive control design framework.
1.3 Preliminaries
1.3.1 Introduction of nonsmooth control
For a general nonlinear dynamical system of the following form:
x˙ = f(t, x,u), (1.1)
where x ∈ R
n
is the system state, u ∈ R is the control input, and f(·) ∈ R
n
is a
continuous nonlinear function.
If we consider the control design problem for system (1.1) under the frame￾work of continuous-time design, it would be very straightforward to discuss
about a significant control problem, i.e., the smoothness of the designed con￾troller u(t). From a mathematical point of view, the controller can be possibly
designed as the following several manners:
(1)u(t) ∈ C
0
; (2)u(t) ∈ C
1
; (3)u(t) ∈ C
l
; l ≥ 1 ∈ N; (4)u(t) ∈ C
∞.
Generally, one can define the controller design for nonlinear system (1.1) un￾der the restriction that u(t) ∈ C
0
as a typical nonsmooth control problem, which
distinguishes itself essentially to continuously differentiable control (u(t) ∈
C
1
,C
l
), or smooth control (C∞). Upon here, a naturally occurring problem is
that:
For a given nonlinear system of the form (1.1), could the nonsmooth con￾troller (u(t) ∈ C
0
), continuously differentiable controller (u(t) ∈ C
1
,C
l
) or
smooth controller (C∞) be constructed in the meantime?
From a theoretical point of view, indeed, what kind of influence will the con￾troller with different smoothness have on the dynamic performance of the con￾trol system has aroused the attention from the system and control community for
many decades.8  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
Let’s consider an illustrative simple 2-D nonlinear system of the form:
x˙1 = x2 +x
2/3
1
,
x˙2 = u. (1.2)
For such system, a natural conjecture is to employ the famous backstepping
controller to design a global nonlinear controller, however, owing to the fact that
in the first-order subsystem, the existence of x
2/3
1 will directly lead to the insuf￾ficient smoothness of the virtual controller, therefore conventional backstepping
method is not applicable for system (1.2). As a matter of fact, system (1.2) can
not be stabilized by any continuously differentiable controller, and the system
can only be stabilized by a continuously nondifferentiable controller, i.e., a C
0
controller.
Further, we could also consider an illustrative real-life under-actuated me￾chanical system of the form [63]
x˙1 = x2,
x˙2 = x
3
3 +
g
l
sinx1,
x˙3 = x4,
x˙4 = u. (1.3)
According to the famous Brockett criterion [5], since the uncontrollable sub￾system of the linearized system at the equilibrium point of the system is unsta￾ble, therefore, the system cannot be stabilized by any continuously differentiable
feedback control law. Theoretically, systems that can be globally continuous and
differentiable stabilized can also be globally nonsmooth stabilized, however in
this case, the converse proposition is not true. Such underactuated mechani￾cal systems cannot be stabilized by any continuously differentiable control law,
therefore, nonsmooth control is the only choice for this kind of systems under
the continuous-time control design requirements.
From the perspective of engineering application, the advanced control indus￾try requires not only the stability of the system, but also the dynamic performance
of the system to meet certain requirements. Among the dynamic performance
indexes, the convergence rate and anti-disturbance ability of the closed-loop sys￾tem are two key indexes. Compared with smooth control, the closed loop systems
under nonsmooth control usually have faster convergence rate and better distur￾bance rejection performance, which has attracted extensive attentions on control
application studies in recent years.
From the convergence point of view, the system states of nonsmooth control
systems are able to converge to the equilibrium within a finite time, which is also
called a finite-time control system [3].
For example, consider the following simple linear system:
x˙ = u. (1.4)Introduction  9
It is very easy to design the following two controllers for system (1.4).

Under the smooth controller (1.6), without loss of generality, here we select
β = 1, the closed-loop system
x˙ = −kx (1.7)
has a solution of
x(t) = e
−ktx(0),
which implies that the closed-loop system (1.7) is globally asymptotically stable.
If we substitute the controller (1.5) into system (1.4), the closed-loop system
gives:
x˙ = −ksign(x)|x|
α
. (1.8)
Calculating the solution of (1.8) gives

(1.9)
It can be concluded from (1.9) that, all the states of the nonsmooth control
system (1.8) will converge to the origin within a finite time.
One can verify the fast convergence rate of a finite-time control system near
the equilibrium point through a specific numerical simulation, depicted in Fig￾ures 1.1–1.2.
It is noted that under both the finite-time controller (1.5) and the smooth
controller (1.6), the amplitude of the controller is almost at the same level for the
sake of fair comparison. It can be clearly observed that, the nonsmooth control
system (1.4)–(1.5) has shown a faster convergence rate than the smooth control
system (1.4)–(1.6). The parameters are selected as k = 1, α = 0.5 and x(0) = 1.
In practical systems, external disturbances are always inevitable for nonlin￾ear systems. For a disturbed nonlinear system, the existence of nonvanishing
disturbance will clearly affect the state convergence. Therefore, under a nons￾mooth feedback control law, generally, the disturbances in the system cannot be
completely attenuated. In other words, in this case, the finite-time convergenc10  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

characteristics of nonsmooth control systems will no longer be maintained. How￾ever, compared with smooth control system, nonsmooth control system normally
performs better anti-disturbance performance. Consider system (1.4) again, and
assume that the system has bounded external disturbance d(t), that is:
x˙ = u+d(t), (1.10)
where d(t) satisfies |d(t)| ≤ d∗. It can be simply concluded that under the

By comparing the formulas (1.11) and (1.12), one knows that under the
smooth controller, in order to obtain a better anti-disturbance control perfor￾mance, it would be necessary to continuously increase the controller gain k. One
direct consequence is that the transient performance of the system might dete￾riorate. However, for the finite-time control system, in addition to adjusting the
controller gain k, the engineers can also adjust an additional parameter, namely
fractional power α.
Here, one can first adjust the gain k such that k > d
∗
, and then reduce the
fractional power α, such that the boundary of the steady-state error ￾

to zero, that is

.
The above analysis shows that the nonsmooth controller is able to signifi￾cantly improve the anti-disturbance ability of the closed-loop system.
Next, we will verify through simulation that the nonsmooth control sys￾tem(1.5)–(1.10) can show better disturbance attenuation ability than the smooth
control system (1.6)–(1.10). Figures 1.3–1.4 show the state response and input re￾sponse curves of the closed-loop system in the presence of external disturbances,
respectively. Here, the parameters are selected as k = 1, α = 0.5, x(0) = 1, and
the external disturbance is set as d(t) = 0.1 sin(t). It is obvious that the closed
loop system under the finite-time controller has a better effect of restraining the
external disturbance in the steady state.

Nonrecursive Robust
Stabilization for
Uncertain Nonlinear
Systems
By noting that classical nonlinear control design approaches usually follow a
systematic recursive synthesis manner, such as popular backstepping and adding
a power integrator methods, therefore an obvious long-term argument appears
here naturally:
How can we ease the recursive design and propose simpler control laws with
strong robustness while the implementation steps are user-friendly?
However, there are quite a few existing results on nonlinear control design
may disobey the beauty of simplicity and hence when control engineers try to
implement those enormous nonlinear controllers, a series of costly calculations
(or, estimations) have been concurred first in order to proceed. As a consequence,
control engineers will finally return to simple PID controllers or state-feedback
controllers via local-linearization methods, etc.
In this chapter, we will investigate a simple one-step stabilization framework
for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems. A novel global nonrecursive stabiliza￾tion design framework is addressed for a class of inherent nonlinear systems with
the presence of system uncertainties and external nonvanishing disturbances. By
virtue of the facility that the weighted homogeneity brings into the system syn￾thesis procedure, a nonrecursive design method is proposed to yield a globally
DOI: 10.1201/9781003399230-2 1718  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
effective robust controller with its expression following a quasi-linear manner.
By proceeding with a rigorous nonrecursive stability analysis framework, which
covers both global asymptotical and finite-time convergence cases, the common
recursively treated derivative items in backstepping based methods are totally
avoided. Inspired by the homogeneous domination technique, a scaling gain per￾formed as a bandwidth factor is introduced into the original system and hence
the robustness of the controlled system can be adjusted to meet the practical per￾formance requirements.
2.1 Problem Formulation
To begin with, we revisit the control problem of realizing the global stabilization
for the following uncertain nonlinear system
(
x˙i = xi+1 + fi(t, x¯i
,θ,d), i ∈ N1:n−1,
x˙n = u+ fn(t, x,θ,d),
(2.1)
where ¯xi = col(x1, x2,··· , xi), x = x¯n, and u are the system partial state vector,
full state vector, and control input, respectively, θ ∈ R
l
is an unknown bounded
parameter vector which could be either time-varying or constant, d represents the
external mismatched disturbances which should be bounded, fi(·), i ∈ N1:n is a
continuous nonlinear function satisfying a vanishing condition. The initial time
is set as t0 while the initial state vector is denoted by x0 , x(t0).
The control objective of this chapter is to find a stabilizing controller of the
following simple form
u(t) = u(x, τ,K,L), (2.2)
where τ is a homogeneous degree, K is the coefficient vector of a Hurwitz poly￾nomial s
n +kns
n−1 +···+k2s+k1 and L ≥ 1 is a scaling gain such that:

 Global Practical Stability: In the case when system (2.1) suffers from
nonvanishing bounded external disturbances, for any given tolerance ε >
0 and initial value x(0), there exists a finite time T
∗ > 0, such that

2.2 Motivation—A Linear Case Study
In order to motivate the nonlinear controller design under a nonrecursive synthe￾sis framework, we first present an illustrative linear case study to depict the main
design idea of this chapter.
To proceed, a necessary assumption expressed as follows is required to be
verified for system (2.1).
Assumption 2.2.1 There exists a known constant σ > 0, such that
| fi(t, x,θ,d)| ≤ σ
X
i
j=1
|xj
|, i ∈ N1:n.
Subsequently, we will go through an explicit nonrecursive stability analysis
procedure to obtain the global stabilizing controller and show that the control
objective can be achieved with a unified framework of analysis.
First, we introduce the scaling gain L into system (2.1) by using a change of
coordinates ζ defined by
ζ = Lx, L = diag{1/L
0
,1/L,··· ,1/L
n−1
}, u = L
n
v. (2.3)
Up to now, without any Lyapunov functions design and recursive deductions,
a linear stabilizer is able to be created of the following form:
u = L
n
v, v = −Kζ . (2.4)
Theorem 2.1
Consider the closed-loop system consisting of (2.1) satisfying Assumption 2.2.1 and
the linear controller (2.4). There exists a sufficiently large scaling gain L, such that
the closed-loop system can be rendered globally asymptotically stable.
Proof: With (2.3), system (2.1) is equivalent to the following one
( ˙ζi = Lζi+1 + fi(t, x,θ,d)/L
i−1

˙ζn = Lv+ fn(t, x,θ,d)/L

.
(2.5)
Build a Lyapunov function as V(ζ ) = ζ
>Pζ , where P is a positive definite
and symmetrical matrix that satisfies the following equation:

Then the following relation holds:

where c ∈ R

Keeping (2.6) and (2.9) in mind, (2.7) can be rewritten as
V˙(ζ ) ≤ −Lkζ k
2 +ckζ k
2

2
. (2.10)
Now we are able to choose the scaling gain L under the following guideline:
L ≥ c+1, (2.11)
such that (2.10) reduces to V˙(ζ ) ≤ −kζ k
2
. Then it is clear that the closed-loop
system is globally asymptotically stable.
2.3 Nonrecursive Robust Stabilization—A Unified
Framework
With the above illustration of a simple linear nonrecursive control design frame￾work, it is shown that under a linear growth condition, we are able to derive a
simple state feedback controller by utilizing a feedback domination design strat￾egy. By further extending the main design conception, now it is made possible
to derive a nonrecursive global stabilization design framework for nonlinear sys￾tems by taking advantage of the homogeneous system theory.
In this section, a novel nonrecursive control design framework is presented to
stabilize the nonlinear system of the form (2.1). Firstly, by constructing a noveNonrecursive Robust Stabilization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems  21
Lyapunov function which adopts a quasi-linear system synthesis manner, the
virtual controllers are not required to render recursive design steps in essence.
Secondly, a simple control law, which consists of a scaling gain as a bandwidth
factor and a quasi-linear state feedback law, can now be explicitly constructed
without recursively determining procedures. Taking consideration of the case
when the nonlinear system is subject to bounded mismatched disturbances, a
sufficiently large value of the scaling gain can make the steady error as small
as possible. Notably, without the presence of external disturbances, now both
asymptotic and finite-time stabilization results can be established under a unified
framework whereas the sign of the homogeneous degree performs as a flexibly
adjustable factor.
2.3.1 Global unified nonrecursive control design framework
In order to realize a global control objective, Assumption 2.2.1 on the system
(2.1) is modified into the following form:
Assumption 2.3.1 There exist a constant τ > −
1
n
and two known constants σ >
0, γ ≥ 0 such that
| fi(t, x,θ,d| ≤ σ
X
i
j=1
|xj
|
r
i+τ
r
j +γ, i ∈ N1:n,
where r , (r1,r2,··· ,rn) with r1 = 1, ri = 1+ (i−1)τ, i ∈ N1:n are positive real
numbers.
Remark 2.1 Assumption 2.3.1 can be regarded as a generalized version of the
assumption proposed in [55] where the external disturbance items are taken into
consideration. In the case when γ = 0, the system nonlinearities can be seen as a
special vanishing case, i.e., fi(0) = 0. More specifically, in the case when τ = 0,
Assumption 2.3.1 covers a wide class of linear growth nonlinearity assumptions.
The following lemma is necessary for subsequent homogeneous controller
design.
Lemma 2.1
Consider the following chain of integrators
x˙i = xi+1, i ∈ N1:n−1, x˙n = v, (2.12)
under a homogeneous control law of the following form
v = −Kbxe
rn+τ
∆r . (2.13)
There exist two constants ς1 ∈ (0,
1
n
) and ς2 ∈ (0,+∞), such that the closed￾loop system (2.12)–(2.13) is globally finite-time stable for τ ∈ (−ς1,0) or globally
asymptotically stable for τ ∈ [0, ς2).22  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
Proof: With the dilation mapping ∆

x, one can easily obtain the following
relations

(2.16)
Considering the case when τ = 0, it is clear that the closed-loop system
(2.12)–(2.13) reduces to ˙x = Ax. Note that A is Hurwitz. Hence, we can con￾clude that ϕ(0, x) = −kxk
2
. This relation concludes ∀x ∈ S, ϕ(0, x) < 0, that is,
ϕ({0} ×S) ⊂ (−∞,0).
By utilizing the Tube Lemma (Lemma 1.6), there exist two constants ς1 > 0
and ς2 > 0, such that
ϕ((−ς1, ς2)×S) ⊂ (−∞,0).
This concludes that for τ ∈ (−ς1, ς2), the closed-loop system is locally sta￾ble. It then follows directly from Lemma 1.5 that the closed-loop system is also
globally stable.
In addition, note that ∂V(τ,x)

where c > 0 is a constant dependent of τ. Moreover, the closed-loop system is
globally asymptotically stable in the case when τ ∈ [0, ς2), or globally finite-time
stable in the case when τ ∈ (−ς1,0). Nonrecursive Robust Stabilization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems  23

will lead to a conclusion that the closed-loop system is globally asymp￾totically stable. If τ ∈ (−ς1,0), then 2κ

∈ (0,1). Hence the finite-time
stabilization result can be concluded straightforwardly from Lemma 1.4.

It is clear that Γ is a bounded constant and can be made arbitrarily small
by tuning the scaling gain L to be sufficiently large. Hence the practical
stability of the closed-loop system can be achieved.
This completes the proof of Theorem 2.2. 
Remark 2.2 Without external disturbances, the proposed nonrecursive design
framework shows us a novel handling strategy to achieve both global asymptotical
and finite-time stabilization results. By taking advantage of the weighted homogene￾ity for the considered inherent nonlinear system, now the controller has several new
features. First, the control law is a result by totally avoiding the costly calculations
of a series of partial derivative terms and hence the expression is very simple, as
depicted by (2.18). Second, without the virtual controller design in recursive ap￾proaches, the stability analysis can be done within only one step and hence is easier
to be realized. Third, the control gains now can be simply selected as the coefficients
of a Hurwitz polynomial which will significantly ease the practical implementations.
Remark 2.3 As is well acknowledged in practical plants that external disturbances
are always inevitable, the proposed method presents us with an alternative robust con￾trol law design procedure. By introducing into the controller a constant bandwidth
factor, the robustness margin of the controlled system can be artificially tuned and
the steady error can be practically adjusted to meet certain control requirements.
2.3.2 Extension to non-triangular systems
Note that Assumption 2.3.1 can be classified as a nonlinear lower-triangular
structural condition. However, the proposed generalized control scheme can also
be applicable to solve a class of non-triangular nonlinear systems which can be
treated as a direct application of Theorem 2.2.
Assumption 2.3.2 Assume there exist constants ν > 0, σ > 0, and γ ≥ 0 such
that the following relation holds for system (2.1)
| fi(t,ζ (t),L,θ(t),d(t))/L
i−1
| ≤ σL
1−ν
kζ k

, i ∈ N1:n.
Based on the above assumption, one can obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 2.3
Under Assumption 2.3.2, there exists a sufficient large scaling gain L ≥ 1, such
that the closed-loop system (2.1)–(2.18) can be rendered globally practically stable
provided γ > 0 and globally stable provided γ = 0.
Proof: The proof of Theorem 2.3 can be straightforwardly derived following
a similar analysis with the proof of Theorem 2.2 and hence is omitted here. 26  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
2.3.3 Numerical simulation
In this subsection, a numerical example and its control performance simulation
is provided in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed nonrecursive
control law design.
Example 2.3.1 Consider the following nonlinear system:
x˙1 = x2 +d1(t),
x˙2 = x3 +θ(t)ln(1+x
2
2
), (2.27)
x˙3 = u+d2(t),
where |θ(t)| ≤ 2 is an uncertain time-varying parameter and d1(t) and d2(t) are
two external disturbances satisfying |d1| ≤ 0.5 and |d2| ≤ 3, respectively.
Set r1 = 1, r2 = 1+τ, r3 = 1+2τ, and κ = 1. With the relation ln(1+x

2
) ≤
2|x2|
1+2τ
1+τ with τ ≤ 0, it is concluded that Assumption 2.3.1 is satisfied. By using
the proposed method, we can design the following stabilizing control law:

In the following simulations, we choose τ = −2/15. k1, k2, k3 can be chosen
as the coefficients of a Hurwitz polynomial s
3 + k3s
2 + k2s + k1. As a conse￾quence, the parameters are selected as K = [5,25,30].
In the case when d1(t) = d2(t) = 0, we choose the scaling gain as L = 3
according to the guideline (2.19). As shown in Figure 2.1(a), the states response
curves of the system (2.27) under the stabilizing control (2.28) can approach the
origin in satisfactory control performance. The time history of the control signal
is shown in Figure 2.1(b).
In the case when d1(t) = 0.5 and d2(t) = 3cos(10t), it is clear that only prac￾tical control result can be achieved by the proposed method. In the simulation,
we show that by choosing different values of the scaling gain L, different steady
error of the system output (i.e., y = x1) is performed. As one can observe from
Figure 2.2(a), by increasing the scaling gain while the control gain K is set as the
same value, a smaller steady-error is obtained. In Figure 2.2(b), the control sig￾nals are given which concludes that a larger control energy is needed to maintain
the controlled system with better robustness.Nonrecursive Robust Stabilization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems  27

Practically Oriented
Finite-Time Tracking
Control for Nonlinear
Systems
Chapter 2 has presented a nonrecursive stabilization framework for a class of
nonlinear systems, however, aiming for designing a globally convergent con￾troller, certain nonlinearity constraints are essential and should be verified in
priority. As a matter of fact, it is well known that a common nonlinear growth
constraint of the considered system is essentially required for global continuous
finite-time stabilization design. For general real-life plants, it is clearly of sus￾picion that most of the nonlinear hypothesis could be widely satisfied. Hence, a
key question arises that for a general class of nonlinear systems, how to essen￾tially relax the pre-requirement of the system nonlinearity constraints, such that
a practically oriented finite-time controller can be widely applied.
In this chapter, aiming to facilitate the implementation of practical systems,
we propose a practically oriented finite-time control design strategy for a class of
lower-triangular nonlinear systems under a less ambitious but more practical con￾trol objective, namely, semi-global rather than restrictive global control. Firstly,
a delicate coordinates transform is presented by exactly calculating the steady￾state generators. Secondly, we show that by going through a nonrecursive design
that the controller scheme design can be essentially detached from its stability
analysis, which is inevitable in the existing recursive design approaches. Thirdly,
DOI: 10.1201/9781003399230-3 2930  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
a rigorous semi-global attractivity and local finite-time convergence provide the
theoretical justifications of the proposed method.
Further, consider that controller design via state feedback design relies on
a restrictive condition that all the states are assumed to be measurable. Due to
the fact that a dynamic tracking algorithm is imperatively required for physi￾cal realization when part of the system states are unmeasurable, in the latter
part of this chapter, a generalized nonrecursive output feedback tracking con￾trol design framework is also presented, which will not only generate a concise
design procedure but also simple dynamic control algorithms. As an additional
compensator to the existing state feedback law, a unified high-gain observer is
exploited which can reduce to a conventional high-gain observer as one special
case and also performs a finite-time state observation under a negative homoge￾neous degree. In order to obtain a generalized tracking control result by covering
a wider class of nonlinear systems and relaxing the implementable requirements
in essence, we further propose a novel tracking control design framework with
bounded trajectories without the prior nonlinearity constraints by trading off the
control objective from global stability to a semi-global one. By modifying the
dynamic compensators proposed in the global control design section, a delicate
semi-global stability analysis is provided to ensure the semi-global attractivity
and exact tracking realization, respectively.
Thereafter, as an illustration of the practical nature of this proposed method,
we show that by utilizing an almost identical nonrecursive design procedure, a
practical tracking control law can also be obtained for a class of more general
nonlinear systems with mismatched disturbances. What is worthy of pointing
out here that by distributing each state a tracking task of their reference nominal
trajectory respectively, rather than only regulating the single output to its refer￾ence signal by neglecting the other states, a relatively more exquisite practical
tracking control law can be obtained.
Compared with the existing related finite-time control design results for
lower-triangular nonlinear systems, the main distinguishable improvements of
this chapter can be stated as follows.
 Firstly, under a semi-global control infrastructure, we show that the exist￾ing essentially required nonlinearity growth constraints, which are gener￾ally restrictive to be verified, can now be fully removed.
 Secondly, the involved adjustable homogeneous degree, which could sig￾nificantly affect the control performance, has been endowed with much
flexibility within a tunable region.
 Thirdly, the proposed novel nonrecursive synthesis approach could render
a finite-time control scheme to be designed in a very simple expression,
whereas its control gain selection follows a conventional pole placement
manner. More specifically, the obtained controller can reduce to its linearPractically Oriented Finite-Time Tracking Control for Nonlinear Systems  31
feedback controller counterpart simply by assigning the homogeneous
degree to zero.

Feedback
3.1.1 Problem formulation
In what follows, a practically oriented finite-time controller is designed in the
nonrecursive manner first. To begin with, the finite-time control problem for a
class of lower-triangular nonlinear systems is revisited:

x˙i = xi+1 + fi(x¯i), i ∈ N1:n−1,
x˙n = u+ fn(x),
y = x1,

where ¯xi = col(x1, x2,··· , xi), i ∈ N1:n−1, and x = x¯n are the system partial and
full-state vectors, respectively; y is the system output; u is the system input and
fi(·), i ∈ N1:n is a known smooth nonlinear function.
Assumption 3.1.1 The output reference signal, denoted by yr and its n-th order
derivative are assumed to be piecewise continuous, known and bounded.
In what follows, for x(0) ∈ ✵x , [−ρ,ρ]
n where ρ ∈ R+ is any given constant
which could be arbitrarily large, the control objective is to find, if possible, a C

controller of the following state feedback form

(n−1)τ) with a homogeneous degree τ ∈ (−

 All the states in the closed-loop system (3.1)–(3.2) are semi-globally uni￾formly bounded;
 There exists a finite-time instant T > 0, such that y−yr = 0, ∀t ≥ T.

To achieve a realizable control scheme, firstly, we define ¯x

In what follows, we show that, without going through the procedure of recur￾sive stability analysis, a simple practically oriented finite-time controller can be
explicitly pre-built of the following form:

Remark 3.1 The proposed regulation methodology presents us with an alterna￾tive, but more practical control design procedure owing to the semi-global control
infrastructure. More distinguishably, the common requirements of various nonlinear￾ity growth conditions on the system nonlinearities, which are always employed in
the existing finite-time control related literatures, are essentially relaxed. Hence any
nonlinear systems of the form (3.1) can be finite-timely controlled by the proposed
controller (3.5) where the main difference relies on the determination guideline of
the bandwidth factor L.

which leads to
V˙(z)

In what follows, we will use a contradiction argument to prove that under
the guideline (3.13), for any non-zero initial states satisfying x(0) ∈ ✵x, all the
trajectories of z(t) will stay in Ω forever.
If the above statement is not true, the trajectory of z(t) will escape the set Ω
within a finite-time. Due to the fact that z(0) ∈ ✵N, it yields
V˙(z(0)) ≤ −(αL−α˜)V
2
2−τ (z(0))
≤ −V
2
2−τ (z(0)) < 0. (3.15)
Hence there must exist two time instants t2 > t1 > 0, such that
i) V˙(z(t1)) < 0,
ii) V(z(t2)) = V(z(t1)),
iii) V˙(z(t2)) > 0. (3.16)
It is clear that (3.14) still holds for t ∈ [t1,t2]. Then the following relations
hold:
V(z(t2))−V(z(t1)) = Z t2
t1
V˙(z(s))ds ≤ −Z t2
t1

2−τ (z(s))ds. (3.17)
By the relation ii) of (3.16) and the fact that V(z(s)) > 0, s ∈ [t1,t2], (3.17)
leads to an obvious contradiction, expressed as
0 ≥
Z t2

V
2
2−τ (z(s))ds > 0.
Hence, we can arrive at the following conclusion:
∀x(0) ∈ ✵x ⇒ z(0) ∈ ✵z ⇒ z(t) ∈ Ω, ∀t ≥ 0,
which implies that the set Ω is an invariance set.
Further, with Lemma 1.4 in mind and owing to the fact that τ ∈ (−ε,0), hence
0 <

2−τ < 1. Then the following relation

leads to a straightforward conclusion that there exists a finite time instant T > 0,
such that y(t)−yr = 0, t ∈ [T,∞).
This completes the proof of Theorem 3.1. 
Remark 3.2 In practice, different from local control strategies, the compact set
✵x of the initial states can be defined under a worst-case study. One can determine a
proper bandwidth factor L via a practical “trial and error” way, which can be stated
as follows. The control gain K can be simply selected following the pole placement
manner first. By setting a large L to guarantee the stability, then one can tune L to be
smaller and smaller while testing the gap between current control performance and
pre-given performance indexes until satisfactory response curves appear.
3.2 Practically Oriented Finite-Time Control via Out￾put Feedback
Considering the case when parts of the states in system (3.1) are very difficult
to be measured, output feedback strategy could show its great potential for prac￾tical implementations. In this section, we first present a global output feedback
control design procedure based on a homogeneous growth constraint for the sys￾tem nonlinearities. Then, by proposing a novel saturated observer and controller,
explicit semi-global stability analysis is presented, which is able to extend the
nonrecursive output feedback design to a wide range of nonlinear systems.
3.2.1 Global finite-time output feedback control
In what follows, an explicit step-by-step controller construction procedure to
derive a simple globally stable dynamic tracking law for system (3.1) will be
presented.
3.2.1.1 Change of coordinates
Firstly, define the following change of coordinates with the denotation of ¯zi =
(z1,z2,··· ,zi)

Then system (3.18) is equivalent to the following z-dynamical system
(

z˙n = Lv+ (fn − ˜fn)/L

3.2.1.2 Nonsmooth observer design
In what follows, for the dynamic system (3.20), a full-order state observer can be
constructed in the following form:
(
˙zˆi = Lzˆi+1 + ( ˆfi − ˜fi)/L
i−1 +L`ibz1 −zˆ1e
ri+1
,i ∈ N1:n−1,
˙zˆn = Lv+ ( ˆfn − ˜fn)/L

rn+1
,
(3.22)
where H , (`1, `2,··· , `n)
> is the observer gain vector and `i
, i ∈ N1:n is the
corresponding coefficient of a Hurwitz polynomial p(s) = s
n +`ns
n−1 +···+`1,
xˆi = L
i−1
zˆi +x
∗
i
, and ˆfi
is defined by ˆfi = fi(xˆ¯i), i ∈ N1:n.
Remark 3.3 The observer (3.22) can also be regarded as a nonsmooth extension
of the well-known high-gain observers reported in [31] whereas the difference relies
on the integration of homogeneous dilation weights r1,r2,··· ,rn+1 with τ < 0. As a
matter of fact, (3.22) reduces to a conventional high-gain observer in the case when
τ = 0.
With (3.21) and (3.22), the error dynamics can be derived as
(
e˙i = Lei+1 + (fi − ˆfi)/L

3.2.1.3 Output feedback controller construction
At this stage, one can design a state feedback controller for system (3.21) of the
following form provided all the states are measurable:
vc = −Kbze
rn+1
∆r , (3.25)
where K , (k1,··· , kn) is the coefficient vector of a Hurwitz polynomial s
n +

In order to present a physically realizable tracking control law, by using the
estimated full states information from the observer (3.22) to replace the states
used in (3.25), now we can construct a globally stabilizing output feedback con￾trol law for system (3.21) of the following form:
v(t) = −Kbzˆe

which implies that u should be expressed as
u(t) = −L

3.2.1.4 Explicit global stability analysis
In order to proceed with the global stability analysis, a prior constrain condition
of the nonlinearity growth rates, well known as a generalized Holder continuous ¨
condition, is required.
Assumption 3.2.1 Given any x¯i
, xˆ¯i ∈ R
i
, and x˜¯i = x¯i − xˆ¯i
, there exists a known
constant vector γ¯i = (γi,1,··· , γi,i) such that
| fi(x¯i)− fi(xˆ¯i)| ≤ |γ¯ibx˜¯ie
ri+τ
∆r |, i ∈ N1:n.
Remark 3.4 Assumption 3.2.1 can be seen as a homogeneous growth condition
which covers both vanishing and nonvanishing cases. Assumption 3.2.1 reduces to
the widely known global Lipschitz continuous condition in the case when τ = 0, and
becomes a Holder continuous condition in the case when ¨ τ < 0.
By combining (3.21) and (3.24) together, denoting Z , (z

obtain the following closed-loop system:

for the vector field Ψ(τ,Z, v). By a simple process of verification, we know that
the closed-loop system (3.26)–(3.29) is ∆r¯-homogeneous of degree τ.
Now we are ready to present the following theorem.
Theorem 3.2
Consider system (3.1) satisfying Assumptions 3.1.1–3.2.1. There exists a sufficiently
large scaling gain L ≥ 1 such that the dynamic output feedback tracking controller of
the form (3.22)–(3.27) will render the output y of system (3.1) globally exactly track
its desired value yr asymptotically provided τ = 0 or within a finite time provided
τ < 0.

3.2.2 Semi-global finite-time output feedback control
In order to obtain a global control result via output feedback, Assumption 3.2.1,
which to some extent is restrictive to be verified, is strongly depended. However,
by a trade-off of the control target, a less ambitious semi-global stabilization
result is considered, which could facilitate practical implementations. Now the
exact tracking objective of system (3.1) can be realized under only a smooth
assumption of the system nonlinearities, which will cover much more general
nonlinear systems.42  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
3.2.2.1 Saturated observer design
Noting that the peaking phenomenon, which is revealed in high-gain observers,
will possibly destabilize the control system, hence under a semi-global control
objective, the observer (3.22) is modified as the following saturated form:
(
˙xˆi = xˆi+1 +h
ˆfiiM +L

, i ∈ N1:n, and the saturation threshold
M will be assigned later.
Remark 3.5 Inspired by [30, 76, 83], a saturation function is employed in the
high-gain observer (3.40) to bound the state and estimation trajectories. The main
difference is the introduced flexibility of a homogeneous degree τ, which could sig￾nificantly affect the convergence speed. In addition, the gain tuning mechanism can
follow a simple pole placement manner while the bandwidth factor will be explicitly
determined in the stability analysis later.
Correspondingly with the same definition of e, the error dynamics should be
modified from (3.24) as

Theorem 3.3
Consider the closed-loop system consisting of system (3.1) satisfying Assumption
3.1.1 and a dynamic output feedback tracking controller of the form (3.40)–(3.42).

the state trajectories will be guaranteed to stay in the compact set Ω forever.

(3.57)

t→∞Z(t) = 0, ∀t ≥ t0, (3.59)
which concludes that the exact tracking realization can be achieved under the
semi-global control objective. Moreover, it is clear from the relation (3.56) that48  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
the output y will exactly track its desired value yr asymptotically provided τ = 0
or within a finite time provided τ < 0.
This completes the proof of Theorem 3.3. 
Remark 3.6 Due to the careful selection of the scaling gain L to dominate the
nonlinear perturbation terms, the known boundary of the initial states (i.e., located in
a compact set) and the fact that a series of saturation functions are employed to avoid
the destabilization of peaking phenomenon, now we can obtain the leverage to avoid
the finite time escape issues.
Remark 3.7 Note that by trading off the control target from global control to a
more practical semi-global one, now the tracking control law can be designed as a
finite-time dynamic compensator without the pre-verification of Assumption 3.2.1
or other restrictive nonlinear growth constraints utilized in many existing literatures,
such as [20, 61], etc. Moreover, by recalling that the homogeneous degree τ in exist￾ing global design methods is always restricted to certain values owing to the exact
verification of the nonlinearity growth assumptions, now the homogeneous degree
could be flexibly tuned to meet certain pre-required convergence rate.
3.2.2.4 Extension to practical tracking control
Aiming for illustrating the nonrecursive output feedback design to achieve ex￾act tracking control, system (3.1) is assumed to satisfy a certainty hypothesis.
However, for a wider class of general nonlinear systems with the presence of
mismatched external disturbances, the proposed method will also lead to an eas￾ily implementable practical tracking controller and the robustness of closed-loop
system can be enhanced by increasing the scaling gain L. More specifically, con￾sider the following nonlinear system:



x˙i(t) = xi+1(t) + fi(x¯i(t)) +di(t), i ∈ N1:n−1,
x˙n(t) = u(t) + fn(x(t)) +dn(t),
y(t) = x1(t),
(3.60)
where di(t), i ∈ N1:n represents a mismatched disturbance term satisfying the
following assumption.
Assumption 3.2.2 There exists a constant D > 0, such that |di(t)| ≤ D, i ∈ N1:n.
In what follows, we will show that by using the same design architecture,
a general practical tracking control result for system (3.60) can be achieved to
enrich the practical nature of the proposed nonrecursive method, which can be
summarized by the following theorem.Practically Oriented Finite-Time Tracking Control for Nonlinear Systems  49
Theorem 3.4
Consider the closed-loop system consisting of (3.60) satisfying Assumptions 3.1.1–
3.2.2 and the output feedback tracking control law (3.40)–(3.42). For any given toler￾ance σ > 0, there exists a proper scaling gain L ≥ 1 and a finite-time T ∗
, such that the
closed-loop system is semi-globally practically stable and |y(t)−yr
| ≤ σ,∀t ≥ T
∗
.
Proof: Using the same coordinates transformation as (3.18), the z-dynamical
system transformed from (3.60) should be modified to the following form:
z˙ = Lψ(z, v) +
{(fi − ˆfi +di(t))/L
i−1
}i∈N1:n

n×1
. (3.61)
Henceforth, with the same observer as (3.40), the error dynamics now should
be presented to the following form:
e˙ = L f(τ,H, e) +
{(fi − h ˆfiiM +di(t))/L
i−1
}i∈N1:n

n×1
. (3.62)
With Assumption 3.2.2 in mind and using the same Lyapunov function as
(3.43), the following relations can be derived directly by applying Lemmas 1.1
and 1.12:

Thereafter, the following semi-global practical stability analysis is almost
identical to the proof of Theorem 3.3, whereas the difference mainly relies on
the additional terms in (3.63)–(3.64). Consequently, with the relation (3.54) in
mind, the derivative of V(τ,Z) along the closed-loop system (3.26)–(3.61) gives

From the derivation of D

in (3.63) which implies the fact that D

can be
made arbitrary small by tuning L to be sufficiently large, then there must exist
a sufficiently large positive constant L

Hence we know that Ω is an invariance set and any trajectories starting from
Ω will be captured by the set Ω1. Therefore, for any given tolerance constant
σ > 0, by using (3.67), there must exist a time instant T
∗
such that the following
relation can be achieved:
|y(t)−yr
| ≤ kzk∆r ≤ σ, ∀t ≥ T
∗ > t0, (3.68)
which concludes that the practical tracking for system (3.60) in the presence
of bounded mismatched disturbances is realized. This completes the proof of
Theorem 3.4. 
Remark 3.8 Compared to many related existing practical tracking control meth￾ods, such as [20, 61, 80], etc., the proposed practical tracking control law can now
be realized in a one-step manner where the expression of the form (3.27) will be
much more concise. More significantly, in the presence of mismatched disturbances
and nonvanishing nonlinearities, the proposed practical tracking law can render ev￾ery states practically track their nominal reference values respectively, rather than
practically regulate the states (x1 −yr
, x2,··· , xn) to the origin via a relatively larger
control energy, which is a common approach proposed in [20, 61].
Remark 3.9 In practice, a set of performance specifications is usually given before
the controller design. It is worthy of pointing out that by following a similar technique
utilized in [24], the selection of the control parameters can also be guided without
much effort to meet the requirements of pre-specified performance indexes.Practically Oriented Finite-Time Tracking Control for Nonlinear Systems  51

Figure 3.2 Output tracking performance (Case 1).
In the following simulation, we choose the homogeneous degree as τ =
−0.21, the control and observer gain vectors are set as K = [27,27,9], H =
[15,75,125] which render A − BK and A − HC both Hurwitz, the sat￾uration threshold is set as M = 100, the scaling gain is chosen as
L = 3.2. To conduct the simulation, the initial value vector is set as
(x1(0), x2(0), x3(0),zˆ1(0),zˆ2(0),zˆ3(0)) = (3,6,17,−1.8,2.5,2). From Figure 3.2,
the exact tracking control objective is realized by the proposed semi-global
output feedback control law. By selecting a negative homogeneous degree, the
tracking task can be achieved within a finite time. The states x1, x2, and x3
can be precisely estimated by the finite-time observer whereas the observation
curves are shown in Figure 3.3. The time history of the control input is given in
Figure 3.4.
Case 2: Practical Tracking Provided di = 0, i = 1,2,3.
In the following simulations, assume d1(t) = d3(t) = 5 sin(10t) + 4 and
d2(t) = 2 sin(10t) − 4. The control parameters are chosen the same as Case 1
except that the scaling gain L is tuned to have different values in order to show
different practical tracking performances. Figure 3.5 shows that under the same
tracking control law, a practical tracking control performance can be obtained
and moreover, the steady-state error can be adjusted to be small enough by tun￾ing the scaling gain to be a larger value. It can be clearly observed from Figure
3.5 that with an increasing scaling gain (i.e., L is tuned from 4 to 5), the steady￾state error can be reduced and the convergence speed can be made faster as well.
However on the other side, a trade-off is the consumption of a larger control en￾ergy as depicted in Figure 3.7. Figure 3.6 shows that practical observation results
can be achieved for system (3.69) in the presence of nonvanishing mismatched
disturbances.Practically Oriented Finite-Time Tracking Control for Nonlinear Systems  53

Remark 3.10 As observed from the design procedure for the numerical exam￾ple (3.69), there is no need to conquer various recursive calculations of virtual con￾trollers, which are inevitable by utilizing all existing recursive approaches. Moreover,
the proposed tracking law is much simpler and the control parameters are easier to
be selected, hence will give much more convenience in practical implementations.Chapter 4
Nonrecursive Adaptive
Control for Nonlinear
Systems with
Non-Parametrized
Uncertainties
In modern control practices, adaptive control method has been well established
and popularly regarded as one of the most effective synthesis tools for systems
involving unknown parameters with possible variations, unknown actuator non￾linearities, external disturbances, etc. Being an attractive research aspect in both
control theory and control engineering, evidence can be regarded as the fact that
various advanced nonlinear adaptive control approaches have been investigated
in recent decades. Among them, adaptive backstepping control based on a feed￾back system form and its derivations have been reported in numerous references.
By assuming that the uncertainties in the system should satisfy a parameter￾ized structure, a systematic adaptive design procedure with a series of tuning
functions is a popular handling strategy. However, most of those related meth￾ods strongly rely on the smooth continuity and certain nonlinearity requirements
which are presented in a feedback structure. In addition, a notable drawback is
the complexity of the controller expression derived by utilizing adaptive back￾stepping design procedures.
DOI: 10.1201/9781003399230-4 5758  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
For nonlinear systems with the presence of non-parametric uncertainties, an
alternative synthesis tool is of significance. In [33, 34, 36, 56], different kinds
of time-varying scaling gain methods are presented, which could derive adap￾tive control laws by means of a dynamic high-gain domination technique. How￾ever, the Lipschitz continuous condition is required for the assurance of a global
asymptotical stabilization result.
Regarding the finite-time adaptive stabilization design, under a polynomial
hypothesis on the system structure, the work in [45] proposes an adaptive design
framework based on feedback domination strategy while a later result in [22]
extends the finite-time adaptive control issue to a class of p-normal uncertain
nonlinear systems. Later on, Sun et al. [72] develop a finite-time stabilization
result via the adding a power integrator technique. Sun and Yang [71] show the
existence of a monotone dynamic scaling gain, whose explicit construction pro￾cedure for practice, however remains open.
It is worth pointing out here that most of the above-mentioned adaptive design
approaches involve a recursive determination of virtual controllers. Direct draw￾back may exhibit on the expanding complexity when the system order is growing
(also called as “explosion of terms”). Meanwhile, the gain selection guideline is
made much conservative by going through a variety of necessary mathematical
estimations. From a practical point of view, proposing a concise control scheme
to simplify the gain tuning mechanism and ease their implementations is more
imperatively demanded.
Inspired by the design facility of homogeneous system theory as illustrated
in the existing literature, a nonrecursive adaptive controller design framework
is proposed in this chapter, aiming to solve the dynamic stabilization problem
for a class of nonlinear systems with the presence of general non-parametric un￾certainties. As a direct benefit of the nonrecursive design approach, a simplest
non-nested stabilizing controller can be constructed independently of the Lya￾punov function-based stability analysis. Besides, the control gain vector can be
easily determined while the dynamic scaling gain is online updated subjecting to
an explicit self-tuning adaption law.

A nonrecursive C

adaptive stabilizing control method, under a semi-global sta￾bility objective, is studied in this section for a class of non-parameterized (or,
nonlinearly parameterized) uncertain nonlinear systems. By incorporating the
homogeneous system theory and a nonrecursive synthesis approach, the result￾ing C
1
adaptive stabilizing control scheme can now be constructed within a novel
one-step design framework. Employing an adaption law to online determine the
time-varying scaling gain, both the controller expression and gain tuning mech￾anism are much simpler than the related existing recursive design approaches.Nonrecursive Adaptive Control for Nonlinear Systems  59
4.1.1 Problem formulation
Consider a class of lower-triangular nonlinear systems with non-parametric un￾certainties, depicted by the following form:
(
x˙i = xi+1 + fi(θ, x¯i), i ∈ N1:n−1,
x˙n = u+ fn(θ, x),
(4.1)
where ¯xi = col(x1, x2,··· , xi), x = x¯n, and u are the system partial state vector,
full state vector, and control input, respectively. θ ∈ R
r
is an unknown bounded
parameter vector which could be either time-varying or constant, fi(·), i ∈ N1:n is
a continuous nonlinear function satisfying a vanishing condition, i.e., fi(θ,0) = 0
for i ∈ N1:n.
The control objective is to find a dynamic stabilizing controller of the follow￾ing non-nested form:

4.1.3 Stabilizing control law construction
To present a stabilizing control result, the following assumption is required to
restrain the system nonlinearities.
Assumption 4.1.1 There exists a non-negative continuous function ψi(θ, x¯i),
such that the following relation holds:

Remark 4.1 In order to pave a way for carrying out homogeneous domination
strategy, such an assumption is currently essential to restrict the nonlinearity growth
rate for system (4.1). By noting that ψi(θ, x¯i) is allowed to be any non-negative con￾tinuous function, hence it is worth pointing out that Assumption 4.1.1 could include
more general nonlinear functions than the common homogeneous growth conditions
required in [55, 73, 91].
By using Lemma 1.10, we know that there must exist two smooth scalar
functions δi(θ) ≥ 1 and γi(x¯i) ≥ 1, such that Assumption 4.1.1 can be further
revised as

4.1.4 Explicit stability analysis
The main result of this section can be summarized by the following theorem.
Theorem 4.1
Consider the closed-loop system consisting of system (4.1) satisfying Assumption
4.1.1 and the adaptive stabilizing controller (4.7). For any initial states of the closed￾loop system starting from a compact set, i.e., (x(0)
>,σˆ(0))> ∈ Γ , [−ρ,ρ]
n+1 with
ρ > 0 being a given constant which can be arbitrarily large, the following statements
hold.
 All the signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly bounded.
 The equilibrium x = 0 is asymptotically stable.

From the fact that 2κ − τ ≥ 2rn+1 − τ ≥ 2r1 = 2, we know that U(z)
is continuously differentiable and proper. With the dilation mapping ∆

z =
(ε

rn zn) where r is the weight vector, one can verify that U(z) ◦ ∆

which clearly conclude that the vector field [z1,z2,··· , v]

Hence by using Lemma 2.1, we know that there exists a constant ς ∈ (0,1),
such that the system

the following relations hold:

Note that θ is bounded, which implies that there must exist two posi￾tive constants ρ¯1, ρ¯2 such that 1 ≤ ρ¯1 ≤ σ ≤ ρ¯2. Hence for any initial states
(x(0)

c) V˙(z(t

Now we consider the trajectory within the time interval [t

,t
00 ]. First, the es￾timation (4.14) is still valid for t ∈ [t
0
,t
00 ], hence one can obtain the following
relations from (4.16):
V(z(t

∆r ds > 0.
Hence, (z(t)
>,σ˜(t))> ∈ Ω, t ∈ [0,∞) is established, which implies that the
trajectory of (z(t),σ˜(t)) is uniformly bounded on the time interval [0,∞). In
addition, there exist positive constants σ¯ and σˇ such that
|σ˜| ≤ σ¯, |σˆ| ≤ σˇ, ∀t ∈ [0,∞). (4.20)
Now we proceed to prove that L is also well defined for t ∈ [0,∞). First,
from the expression of L˙ in (4.7), it is clear that L˙ ≥ 0 for t ∈ [0,∞). By defining
a monotone increasing time sequence t`
, L ∈ N1:∞, two cases can be addressed
below.Nonrecursive Adaptive Control for Nonlinear Systems  65
Case 1): If L(t`) satisfies µcL1−ρ
(t`) − c¯σˆ(t`) ≥ 0, by the continuity of L
and the fact that ˙σˆ ≥ 0, there exist two time instants t`+1 < t`+2 < ∞, such that
L˙(t) = 0, t ∈ [t`
,t`+1);L˙(t) > 0, t ∈ [t`+1,t`+2). Then we shall turn to the following
alternative case.
Case 2): If µcL1−ρ
(t`+1)−c¯σˆ(t`+1) < 0 (i.e., L˙(t`+1) > 0), one can conclude
that the following relations hold:
(
a) µcL1−ρ
(t)−c¯σˆ(t) < 0, t ∈ [t`+1,t`+2),
b) µcL1−ρ
(t`+2)−c¯σˆ(t`+2) ≥ 0.
(4.21)
If the above statements are not true, it implies that
µcL1−ρ
(t)−c¯σˆ(t) < 0, t ∈ [t`+1,∞).
From (4.7), we know L(t) keeps increasing for t ∈ [t`+1,∞). On the other
hand, with the fact that |σˆ| ≤ σˇ, t ∈ [0,∞), the following relation draws an
obvious contradiction:
L(t) <

c¯σˇ
µc
 1
1−ρ
, t ∈ [t`+1,∞).
Hence, (4.21) indicates that for t = t`+2, we are back to Case 1). Then by
repeatedly discussing the above two cases, and noticing the fact that |σˆ| ≤
σˇ, t ∈ [0,∞), one can draw a conclusion that L(t) is bounded for the time in￾terval [0,∞) and moreover, there exists a bounded positive constant L¯ such that
lim
t→∞
L(t) = L¯.
ii) On the one hand, from (4.16), by noting that V is monotone decreasing
and L ≥ 1, we have

On the other hand, one can also conclude that ˙z(t) and z(t) are uniformly
bounded for t ∈ [0,∞). It can be straightforwardly deduced from Barbalat’s
Lemma that z(t) → 0, t → ∞, which implies that the equilibrium x = 0 is asymp￾totically stable. This completes the proof of Theorem 4.1. 
4.1.5 Extension to a linear control case
In practice, verifying Assumption 4.1.1 might present a non-easy task. In what
follows, we show that by following Theorem 4.1, an interesting semi-global sta￾bilizing control result can be obtained for lower-triangular systems of the form
(4.1) with essentially relaxed nonlinearity constraints.66  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
More specifically, for any initial states of system (4.1) starting from a com￾pact set, we will show that the following adaptive control law:
(
u = −L
n+1Kz,
˙σˆ = c1kzk
2
2
,
L˙ = Lmax{0, c2σˆ −c3L}, L(0) ≥ 1,
(4.23)
is able to stabilize nonlinear system of the form (4.1) with only C
1 nonlinearities.
The result can be summarized by the following theorem.
Theorem 4.2
Assume the nonlinear functions of system (4.1) belong to C
1
. Consider the
closed-loop system consisting of system (4.1) and the adaptive controller (4.23). If
(x(0)
>,σˆ(0))> ∈ Γ , [−ρ,ρ]
n+1 with ρ > 0 being a given constant which can be
arbitrary large, then the following statements hold.
 All the signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly bounded.
 The system state will converge to the origin asymptotically.
Proof: Similar to the handling procedures (4.11)–(4.13), using Mean-Value
Theorem and Lemma 1.10, we know that the following relations hold for any
function fi(θ, x¯i) ∈ C

where σ > 0 is an unknown constant dependent on θ, γ¯i
, c¯i are bounded positive
constants which are dependent on the value of M. The remainder of the stability
analysis could be almost identical to the proof of Theorem 4.1 by simply setting
τ = 0 and κ = 1, and hence is omitted here. 
Remark 4.2 It can be observed from Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 that by setting the
homogeneous degree τ = 0, the smooth control result proposed in Theorem 4.1 can
be specified to a linear adaptive control case. The main differences rely on the system
nonlinearity pre-requirement and the employed homogeneous degree. In Theorem
4.1, by tuning the homogeneous degree to a larger value, a faster convergence rate
can be achieved provided that the system state is far away from its equilibrium.
Remark 4.3 The result in Theorem 4.2 presents an essential enrichment in the area
of adaptive control for strict-feedback systems. First, the requirement of sufficientNonrecursive Adaptive Control for Nonlinear Systems  67
smooth continuity of system nonlinearities for controller design with backstepping
approaches is totally removed with a weaker C
1
condition. Second, it is shown that
a simple linear state feedback law will be sufficient to stabilize a nonlinear system
via a time-varying scaling gain under a semi-global control objective. This feature
greatly facilitates practical implementations.
In order to illustrate the simplicity of the proposed control design strategy,
the following example is studied.
Example 4.1.1 Consider a 3-D nonlinear system of the following form



x˙1 = x2 +θx
4/3
1
x˙2 = x3 +x1x2
x˙3 = u,
(4.25)
where θ = 0.5 is an unknown parameter to the designer.
On one hand, system (4.25) is of interest here due to the fact that functions
x
4/3
1
, x1x2 are not global Lipschitz continuous, which implies that this system
does not satisfy the assumptions required in [33,34,36,56]. On the other hand, it
is obvious that when carrying out the adaptive backstepping technique, the singu￾larity problem appears when differentiating the virtual controller of α2. However,
with the proposed method in Theorem 4.2, one can obtain the following simple
adaptive stabilizing control law:



u = −L
4
(k1z1 +k2z2 +k3z3),
˙σˆ = 0.5(z
2
1 +z
2
2 +z
2
3
),
L˙ = Lmax{0, 2/3σˆ −7/15L}.
(4.26)
As shown by the simulation results in Figures 4.1 and 4.2, all the signals are
bounded and the adaptive stabilization can be realized by setting K = [27,27,9],
[x(0);σˆ(0),L(0)] = [2,−2,2; 0.1,1.1].
Remark 4.4 Owing to the proposed systematic nonrecursive design approach, now
the control gain vector can be determined simply by following a conventional pole
placement manner, i.e., finding a proper vector K to render its companion matrix
A − BK Hurwitz. The time-varying scaling gain L will be updated online, which is
dependent on the estimation of the unknown parameter σ.
4.1.6 Extension to non-triangular nonlinear systems
A feedback structure of nonlinear systems is currently considered as an essential
precondition for adaptive controller design. Relaxing the restriction of lower￾triangular structure is never a trivial task and few results can be referred to in68  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

the literature. However, owing to the design facility of a nonrecursive synthesis
manner, the proposed result can also be applicable to a certain class of nonlinear
systems which presents a non-triangular system structure, depicted by
(
x˙i = xi+1 + fi(θ, x), i ∈ N1:n−1,
x˙n = u+ fn(θ, x).
(4.27)
To proceed, the following assumption is presented in order to restrain the non￾linearity growth rate of system (4.27).
Assumption 4.1.2 There exist an unknown constant σ > 0 dependent on θ, a
constant ρ < 1, such that under the transform of coordinates in (4.3), the follow￾ing relation holds:

i ≤ σL

, i ∈ N1:n.
By utilizing the same design procedure proposed in the above subsections,
one can deduce the following theorem straightforwardly.
Theorem 4.3
Consider the closed-loop system consisting of system (4.27) satisfying Assump￾tion 4.1.2 and the adaptive stabilizing controller (4.23). If (x(0)
>,σˆ(0))> ∈ Γ ,
[−ρ,ρ]
n+1 with ρ > 0 being a given constant which can be arbitrary large, then the
following statements hold.
 All the signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly bounded.
 The system state will converge to the origin asymptotically.
Proof: By careful observation, Assumption 4.1.2 could directly render the
relation (4.14) while the other stability analysis steps are exactly the same. The
remainder proof can be carried out by an almost identical analysis procedure with
the proof of Theorem 4.1, and hence is omitted here. 
Remark 4.5 Note that the existing adaptive controllers are mainly built by recur￾sive design procedures which strongly rely on the strict-feedback structure of the
system. Assumption 4.1.2 allows a non-triangular structural hypothesis, a significant
relaxation from the strict-feedback structure widely assumed in the existing litera￾ture. In a recent result [6], stabilizing systems in classical strict-feedback forms with
sufficiently small non-triangular structural perturbations are investigated. However,
the proposed controller design scheme is still based on the triangular structural nomi￾nal model of the system. Furthermore, a linear growth constraint is strongly depended70  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
on, which can be considered as a special case of Assumption 4.1.2 provided τ = 0
and fi(θ,0) = 0.
Remark 4.6 It is well acknowledged that the global adaptive control problem
for nonlinear systems with non-triangular structure is a very challenging issue. Thus
very few existing methods can be found in the literature. To some extent, Assumption
4.1.2 is still not straightforward to be pre-verified. The proposed result provides us
a pioneer nonrecursive synthesis method for a class of complex nonlinear systems
without structural restrictions and it possibly opens a new interesting topic for further
investigation by researchers in the community.
The following example provides an illustrative demonstration of the effec￾tiveness of the result proposed in Theorem 4.3.
Example 4.1.2 Consider the following uncertain nonlinear system

The above relations conclude that Assumption 4.1.2 holds for system (4.28)
with ρ = 3/7, τ = 1/5,r1 = 1,r2 = 6/5,r3 = 7/5, and κ = 8/5. Hence follow￾ing the proof of Theorem 4.3, after a series of calculations, we can design the

4.2.1 Problem formulation
Let’s revisit a class of lower-triangular nonlinear systems with non-parametric
uncertainties, depicted as the form (4.1). The following assumption is made in
prior.

Under the above assumption, the control objective is to find a dynamic stabi￾lizing controller of the following non-nested form:

such that the following conclusions hold for the resulting closed-loop system
(4.1)–(4.31),
 All the signals are globally uniformly bounded.
 The origin x = 0 is a finite-time stable equilibrium.
Subsequently, three handling procedures are presented to better illustrate the
nonsmooth adaptive stabilization design.
4.2.2 Parameter configuration
With the denotation that A,B are matrices of controllable canonical form,
z(θ, x) = (f1(·), f2(·),··· , fn(·))>, system (4.1) can be rewritten as the follow￾ing compact form:
x˙ = Ax+Bu+z(θ, x). (4.32Nonrecursive Adaptive Control for Nonlinear Systems  73
The homogeneous dilation weight r is set as r1 = 1, ri = ri−1 +τ, i ∈ N2:n

should be expressed as the following compact form
˙ξ = L(Aξ +Bv)−(ρIn +D)ξL˙/L+z˜ (L,θ, x). (4.35)
4.2.4 Nonsmooth control law construction
At this stage, corresponding to (4.31), we are already able to design a nonsmooth
dynamic state feedback stabilizing controller of the following simplest form

(4.36)
where µ ∈ R+ is a design constant.74  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
Remark 4.7 Compared to related existing results on universal adaptive design
problem for non-parametric nonlinear systems, such as [24, 44, 71], etc., a distin￾guishable feature of the proposed adaptive controller is that both the proposed control
law and design procedure are much simpler by totally neglecting the costly recur￾sive calculations. More significantly, the controller design procedure is essentially
detached from a recursive determination process of virtual controllers so that the
step-by-step calculations of the tuning functions are also avoided. This characteristic
could endow the practitioners much more convenience to implement the controller
in real-life plants.
Remark 4.8 Inspired by the existing dynamic high gain techniques and the facility
of homogeneous system theory, one could find that if an indirect adaption law for the
dynamic gain is settled, rather than directly estimating the uncertain parameters via
classical tuning functions, a nonrecursive adaptive synthesis approach is promising,
which could facilitate the practitioners. Moreover, the proposed method can also be
regarded as an essential nonsmooth extension of the result in [36, 56]. Indeed, in a
special case by setting the homogeneous degree τ = 0, the control law (4.36) could
reduce to a linear universal controller of the following form:
(
u = L

v, v = −Kξ ,
L˙ = µkξ k

, L(t0) = 1.
(4.37)
4.2.5 Stability analysis
We will show that global stabilization can be realized by the proposed nonsmooth
adaptive controller of the form (4.36).
The main result of this section can be stated as follows.
Theorem 4.4
Consider the closed-loop system consisting of (4.1) satisfying Assumption 4.2.1 and
the nonsmooth adaptive control scheme (4.36). The following conclusions hold.
 All the signals in the closed-loop system are globally uniformly bounded.
 The system state will converge to the origin within a finite time.

From the fact that the homogeneous degree τ < 0 and κ > 1, we know that
V(ξ ) ∈ C
1
. With the dilation mapping ∆
r
ε
ξ = (ε
r1 ξ1,··· , ε
rn ξn), one can easily
verify that V(∆
r
ε
ξ ) = ε
2γV(ξ ).
Calculating the time derivative of V(ξ ) along system (4.35) gives
V˙(ξ ) =∂V(ξ )

∂V(ξ )
∂ ξ >
(ρIn +D)ξL˙/L+
∂V(ξ )
∂ ξ >
z˜ (L,θ, x).
(4.38)
To proceed, a series of estimations on the terms in (4.38) will be given.
Firstly, it is not difficult to obtain the following relations:
(

which conclude that the vector field Aξ +Bv is ∆

-homogeneous of degree τ. One
can follow Lemma 2.1 directly that the closed-loop system is globally finite-time
stable.
In addition, noting that ∂V(ξ )
∂ ξ> (Aξ +Bv) ∈ H2κ
∆r and V(ξ ) ∈ H
2γ
∆r , by applying
Lemma 1.1, there exists a constant c1 ∈ R+, such that the following relation holds

Substituting (4.39), (4.42) and (4.43) into (4.38), the time derivative of V(ξ )

i) In what follows, we will use contradiction arguments to prove that there
will be no finite escape time of the trajectory (ξ
>,L)
> starting from t0. If the
above statement is not true, there must exist a maximal time interval [t0,tf) where
tf > t0, such that (ξ
>,L)
> are well defined and lim
t→tf
k(ξ
>,L)
>k = +∞.
Firstly, we show that L cannot escape at t =tf
. Otherwise, the relation lim
t→tf
L =
+∞ holds. Noting that c1, c2, σ are all bounded, hence there exists a time instant
t1 satisfying t0 < t1 < tf
, such that
c1L−c2σ ≥ 1, t ∈ [t1,tf
].
This relation could lead to a fact that
V˙(ξ ) ≤ −kξ k
2κ
∆r , t ∈ [t1,tf
].
Therefore, with the update law (4.36), it is straightforward that

which is clearly a contradiction. Then one could claim that L is well defined in
the time interval [t0,tf
].
Secondly, we show that ξ cannot escape at t = tf
. Integrating both sides of
(4.44) over the time interval [t0,t] yields
V(ξ (t))−V(ξ (t0)) ≤ −Z t

V(ξ (tf)) ≤ V(ξ (t0))−
c1
2µ
(L
2
(tf)−1) + c2σ
µ
(L(tf)−1).
From the fact that L(tf) is bounded, it is obvious that V(ξ (tf)) is also
bounded. With Lemma 1.1 in mind, it is clear that there exists a constant c4 ∈ R+
such that
kξ (tf)k∆r ≤ c4V
1
2γ (ξ (tf)),
which implies that ξ (tf) is bounded. This fact clearly contradicts the finite escape
time claim.
In conclusion, we have already proved that (ξ
>,L)
> is well defined and glob￾ally uniformly bounded for t ∈ [t0,∞).
ii) Using the boundness of ˙ξ and ξ for t ∈ [t0,∞), it can be straightforwardly
deduced from Barbalat’s Lemma that ξ → 0, t → ∞.
In addition, by recalling from the expression (4.36) that L is monotone in￾creasing and c1, c2,σ are bounded, we know there must exist a time instant T1 ≥t0
such that
c1L−c2σ > 0, ∀t ≥ T1.
Note that with Lemma 1.1, the following relation holds:
kξ k
2κ
∆r ≥ c5V
2κ
2κ−τ (ξ ),
with c5 being a positive constant. Then with (4.44) in mind, the following relation
holds
V˙(ξ ) +c5(c1L−c2σ)V(ξ )
2κ
2κ−τ ≤ 0, t ≥ T1. (4.46)
Based on (4.46), it can be deduced straightforwardly from Lemma 1.4 that
there exists a finite time T2 ≥ T1, such that ξ (t) = 0, ∀t ≥ T2.
This completes the proof of Theorem 4.4. 78  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
Remark 4.9 As implied by the proof, the closed-loop system stability is directly
dependent on a sufficiently large scaling gain L which is subject to a simple self￾tuning update law in (4.36). Indeed, it can be concluded from the initial value
L(t0) = 1 that the closed-loop system could possibly be unstable at the initial stage.
However, L is made monotone increasing as L˙(t) ≥ 0, which is illustrated by Figure
4.6 in Example 4.2.1. After a short period, L(t) can be sufficiently large to render the
closed-loop system stable.
Remark 4.10 Owing to the proposed systematic nonrecursive synthesis approach,
now the control gain parameter determination can be simplified as preliminary works.
Similar to the method in [94], one can find a constant gain vector K to render A−BK
Hurwitz first, and then obtain P by solving LMI in (4.33). Therefore the value ρ
can be selected. Noting that the value of µ is critical to the increasing rate of L,
hence, a proper choice of the parameter µ can be determined via “trial and error”
method. Subsequently, the scaling gain L will be self-tuned online from its initial
value L(0) = 1. A detailed illustration will be shown in Example 4.2.1 later. Such
a gain tuning mechanism can be regarded as a mediate role between adaptive and
robust methods. It provides the controlled system with certain robustness, but the
conservative selection guideline of L in the existing related robust methods, such
as [55, 91], is no longer required.
4.2.6 An illustrative example
An example as an illustrative demonstration of the simplicity and effectiveness
of the proposed control scheme is given below.
Example 4.2.1 Consider the following uncertain nonlinear system



x˙1 = x2 +ln(1+ (θ1x1)
2
)
x˙2 = x3 +sin(θ2x2)
x˙3 = u,
(4.47)
where θ1 = 0.2 sin(t) and θ2 = 0.1 are unknown parameters to the designer.
Denoting σ = max{2|θ1|
6/7
,|θ2|
5/6}, one can verify the following relations:
| f1(θ, x1)| = |ln(1+ (θ1x1)
2
)| ≤ 2|θ1|
6/7
· |x1|
6/7 ≤ σ|x1|
6/7
,
| f2(θ, x2)| = |sin(θ2x2)| ≤ σ|x2|
5/6
.
Thus system (4.47) satisfies Assumption 4.2.1 with τ = −1/7, r1 = 1, r2 =
6/7, r3 = 5/7. Hence without going through a series of recursive determination
of virtual controllers, one can design directly from system (4.47) of the followingNonrecursive Adaptive Control for Nonlinear Systems  79

.
Before doing simulation, K is first selected as in [1,3,3] to render its compan￾ion matrix A−BK Hurwitz, which is quite easy, and by solving (A−BK)
>P+
P(A−BK) ≤ −I, one can determine a proper matrix of the form:
P =


2.31 1.94 0.50
1.94 3.25 0.81
0.50 0.81 0.44

.
Second, set κ = 1.2. Calculating the smallest eigenvalue of Ξ1P+PΞ1 gives
0.76, then the design parameter ρ can be set as 2. Aiming to show the impact
on the control performance from the design parameter µ, we select two different
values in the simulation, i.e., µ = 2 and 20, respectively. To conduct the simula￾tion, the initial values are set as x(0) = [−2,3,4].
It can be observed from Figures 4.5–4.6 that all the signals in the closed-loop
system (4.47)–(4.48) are uniformly bounded and the trajectories of the states
converge to the origin in a satisfactory control performance. The time history of
the dynamic control signal is shown in Figure 4.7. Note that a larger µ could
require a larger control effort, but lead to a faster response.

The main result of this section can be summarized by the following theorem.
Theorem 4.5
Under Assumption 4.2.1, consider the closed-loop system consisting of (4.1)–(4.50)–
(4.51). The following statements hold:
 All the signals in the closed-loop system are globally uniformly bounded;
 The system state will converge to the origin within a finite time.82  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

Taking the fact that L(t) is a non-decreasing function and ˇc, c3,a3,σ are all
bounded constants into consideration, there should exist a time instant t1 > t0,
such that ˇcL−c3 −a3σ ≥ 1,∀t ≥ t1. In this situation, (4.63) can be simplified as
W˙ ≤ −(kek

For the convenience of statement, suppose that L will escape at t = tf
, i.e.,
lim
t→tf
L = +∞, and clearly, t1 < tf holds. Combined with the mentioned relation￾ships above, the following contradiction holds:

Hence one can claim that L is well defined in the time interval [t0,tf

At this stage, we are able to declare that z is well defined and bounded in t ∈

system is depicted as W2(z) = ￾

the philosophy, combined with the dynamic scaling gain configuration and the
boundness of L, we know that the signal of z cannot escape within a finite-time
instant.
Subsequently, since L and z are all bounded in t ∈ [t0,tf
], we shall prove that
e is also well defined. Similar to the proof procedure for the boundness of z, for

Subsequently, the design procedure can be implemented as:

In the simulation, the non-parametric uncertainties are set as: θ1 =

27,α3 = 9; c = 300,ρ = 0.2; k1 = 9, k2 = 27,k3 = 27, τ = −0.15. The initial value
of the state is x1(0) = 0.5,x2(0) = 1.5,x3(0) = 0, and ˆx1 = −1, xˆ2 = 0,xˆ3(0) = 1.
It can be observed from Figures 4.8–4.10 that all the signals are uniformly
bounded and the trajectories of the states converge to the origin in a satisfactory
control performance. Meanwhile, the state estimation can converge in a short
time. The time history of the nonsmooth dynamic control signal is shown in

Nonrecursive Robust
Output Regulation for
Nonlinear Systems with
Mismatched Disturbances
Developing high performance output regulation schemes for nonlinear systems
with the presence of mismatched uncertainties/disturbances is always a chal￾lenging but imperative issue in the control community. Owing to the blossom
of uncertainty/disturbance measurement and identification tools over the past
two decades, the issue of exact output tracking realization for nonlinear sys￾tems in the presence of mismatched uncertainties/disturbances has aroused great
efforts in the control community. Output regulation theory [23, 28, 82, 85], slid￾ing mode techniques [7, 11, 19], and other control Lyapunov function based ap￾proaches [40, 97] can be extensively found as three main effective branches.
In this chapter, we are considering a more challenging theoretical issue of
designing a nonsmooth output regulation law to achieve a finite-time tracking
realization even for systems subject to mismatched disturbances. Compared to
its asymptotical exact tracking control counterpart, very few existing tools can be
found to solve the nonsmooth tracking control problem. To be specific, without
imposing any nonlinear growth conditions, most of the existing related results
are non-applicable.
Note that when the system is disturbed by mismatched disturbances, rather
than popularly assumed matched disturbance, the control performance will
DOI: 10.1201/9781003399230-5 8990  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
inevitably be affected and the objective of achieving an exact output tracking
result is well acknowledged as a very challenging issue. In the existing litera￾ture, under different assumptions, various disturbance observation tools can be
found. One can refer to [40] for more details. Specifically, as a main concern,
finite-time disturbance observation will yield a finite-time system performance
recovery by adopting a feedforward compensation design, is clearly of signifi￾cance in the exact tracking problems. An existing result can be referred to the
famous higher order sliding mode (HOSM) disturbance observer. However con￾sidering the parameter configuration for the HOSM observer is a complicated
process, motivated by the homogeneous observer design tools in the literature, an
alternative continuous finite-time disturbance observer is also presented. Under
a hypothesis that the mismatched disturbances are guided by certain nonlinear
exogenous systems, it is shown that a saturated disturbance observer will also
realize a finite-time system performance recovery while the observer gain tuning
mechanism follows a simple tuning mechanism. Further, considering a practical
case that even the exosystem cannot be exactly identified, a generalized practi￾cally effective disturbance estimation result can also be achieved, which has been
illustrated by a real-life application.
In this chapter, we shall propose, by developing a novel nonrecursive ho￾mogeneous domination strategy, an alternative practically oriented design which
can directly address finite-time composite controllers with a simpler expression.
Moreover, by proposing a less demanding but more practical control objective,
namely, semi-global instead of global control, the restrictive nonlinearity growth
constraints in most of the existing related continuous finite-time control works
can be fully removed. As a matter of fact, an essential smooth condition for the
system nonlinearities will be sufficient to derive an exact tracking control law,
even with the presence of mismatched disturbances, covering both smooth and
nonsmooth control cases. Firstly, a delicate coordinates transformation is given
by virtue of exactly calculating the steady-state equations. Secondly, the con￾ventional virtual controllers in recursive design steps are no longer required in
essence, while a concise nonsmooth composite control law can be explicitly con￾structed. Thirdly, it is shown, by rigorous analysis of the semi-global attractivity,
any trajectory from an arbitrary large compact set will be captured by an arbitrary
small set and then converge to its equilibrium within a finite-time.

generality, the initial time is set as zero.
5.2 Disturbance Observer Design
Aiming to realize an accurate tracking result for the nonlinear systems in the
presence of mismatched disturbances, a promising handling procedure is to iden￾tify or reconstruct the disturbance terms. In what follows, we will present a few
disturbance observer design methods to enable the subsequent feedforward com￾pensation processes.
5.2.1 A nonrecursive finite-time disturbance observer design
First, a nonrecursive finite-time disturbance observer is designed based on a cer￾tain assumption for the mismatched disturbances as shown below.

i = zi, j+2, j ∈ N0:n−i+1, and with Assumption 5.2.1 in mind, the following
extended system can be achieved

is a bounded constant.
In the case when |zi, j − hzˆi, jiM| ≥ 1, ∀ j ∈ N2:n−i+1, by noting that |zi, j

Therefore, for any well defined x(t), all the signals in the error dynamics (5.4)

from Lemma 1.4 that the error dynamics (5.4) is finite-time stable.
This completes the proof of Theorem 5.1. 
5.2.2 A practical nonrecursive disturbance observer
Under the assumption that the disturbances are subject to known external exosys￾tems, Theorem 5.1 has presented a rigorous theoretical result on exact distur￾bance estimation. However, by noticing that the disturbance models are usually
a non-trivial task to be identified, the direct application of the finite-time distur￾bance observer (5.3) might be somehow difficult. In what follows, we show that
an alternative practical nonsmooth composite control result can also be estab￾lished based on the following weaker and more practical assumption.Nonrecursive Robust Output Regulation for Nonlinear Systems  95

Consider the disturbance observer (5.12) under Assumption 5.2.2. For any well
defined trajectory x(t) in system (5.1) and an arbitrarily small positive constant εi

Remark 5.1 The disturbance observer (5.12) can also be seen as a nonsmooth
extension of existing GPI disturbance observers, which could handle a variety of
commonly seen disturbances.

5.3 Robust Output Regulation—A Linear Case Study
Based on the disturbance observation technologies presented above, this section
presents a simple linear composite control design procedure to illustrate the non￾recursive design framework.
5.3.1 System pre-treatment
Provided that all the disturbance terms d
0
i
s are exactly known, we are thereafter
able to define an auxiliary variable χ¯i = (χ1,χ2,··· ,χi)
>, i ∈ N1:n+1, where each
element χi
is determined by the following output regulation equations:



χ1 = yr
,
χi =
dχi−1
dt
− fi−1(χ¯i−1)−di−1, i ∈ N2:n+1.
(5.17)
Note that (5.17) is clearly inaccessible in practice. However, with the corre￾sponding estimates from the disturbance observers proposed in the above section
(e.g., (5.15)), replacing ∂d
j
i
∂t
j by zi, j+1 for i ∈ N1:n, j ∈ N0:n−i+1, one can therefore
obtain the following implementable state trajectory reference function:
x
∗
i = χi(z, y¯r), i ∈ N1:n+1 (5.18)
where z = (z1,0,z1,1,··· ,z1,n,··· ,zn,1)

Further, let ηi
:= xi − x

change of coordinates of the following form:

where L ≥ 1 is a scaling gain to be made precise in the stability analysis later on,
system (5.1) can be transformed to the following stabilizable form:

5.3.3 Stability analysis
The main result of this section is presented by the following theorem.
Theorem 5.3
Under Assumptions 3.1.1 and 5.2.2. For the closed-loop system consisting of (5.1)–
(5.15)–(5.22) and any state satisfying that x0 ∈ ✵ , [−ρ,ρ]
n
, with ρ ∈ R+ being an
arbitrarily large constant, the following statements hold:
 All signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly bounded;
 lim
t→∞
y = yr
.
Proof: In what follows, the detailed stability analysis of the proposed con￾troller is given step by step. For system (5.21), the candidate Lyapunov function
regarding ξ is constructed as V(ξ ) = ξ
>Pξ in which P satisfies P = P
> and
(A−BK)
>P+P(A−BK) ≤ −In.
Taking the derivative of V(ξ ) along (5.21), we will arrive at
V˙(ξ ) = ∂V(ξ )
∂ ξ >
L(A−BK)ξ +
∂V(ξ )
∂ ξ >
F(·) + ∂V(ξ )
∂ ξ >
ε. (5.23)
According to the guideline of the parameter matrix P, one can get that
∂V(ξ )
∂ ξ >
L(A−BK)ξ ≤ −Lkξ k
2
. (5.24)
For the nonlinear function fi(·), from (5.18) and Lemma 5.1, we know that for
any well-defined x(t), x
∗
i
is uniformly bounded, i.e., there is a positive constant
ρ¯ satisfying max
i∈N1:n
{sup
t≥0
{x

is given.
Define a level set

>Pη ≤ c0 , sup
η∈Ωη=[−(ρ+ρ¯),(ρ+ρ¯)]
{η

)
.Nonrecursive Robust Output Regulation for Nonlinear Systems  99
Furthermore, one can get that ∀η(t) ∈ Ω ⇒ ξ (t) ∈ Ω.
For a smooth nonlinear function, the relationship

is a non￾negative function.
If η ∈ Ω, there is a positive constant N¯ satisfying |xj

exists a positive constant µi
independent to scaling gain L, satisfying µ¯i(x¯i

where c1 > 0 is a constant.
Finally, from Assumption 5.2.2 and Lemma 5.1, ε is related to the conver￾gence time instant T1, hence, the mathematical analysis of ε is categorized into
two parts, i.e., t ∈ [0,T1) and t ∈ [T1,∞).
For the case when t ∈ [0,T1), from Assumption 5.2.2, one can get that there
must exist a bounded constant E ∈ R+ rendering to sup
i∈N1:n
{|εi
|} ≤ E. Keeping
Lemma 1.12 in mind, we have

where c2 > 0 is a constant.
At this point, the selection guideline of the fixed scaling gain L is able to
be presented. For ease of description, define a suitable positive constant δ ∈
(0, c0/2). Then, we can choose a sufficiently large L satisfying
L ≥ c1 +c2 +1; E
2 ≤
L−c1 −c2
2λmax(P)
δ. (5.28)
In what follows, the boundness of ξ should be claimed, i.e., for any non-zero
initial state η(0) ∈ Ωη , any trajectory of ξ (t) will stay in Ω.100  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
Suppose that ξ will escape in the convergence process. Considering the es￾cape phenomenon, there exists a time point t1 > 0, such that
η
>(t1)Pη(t1) = c0, V˙(ξ (t1)) > 0. (5.29)
It is clear that ∀t ∈ [0,t1],η(t) ∈ Ω. Substituting (5.24), (5.26), and (5.27) into
(5.23), it yields
V˙(ξ ) ≤ −(L−c1 −c2)kξ k
2 +E
2
. (5.30)
Integrating the fact that kξ k
2 ≥ λ
−1
max(P)V(ξ ), (5.30) can be rewritten as
V˙(ξ (t1)) ≤ −(L−c1 −c2)λ
−1
max(P)
￾
V(ξ (t1))−0.5δ

≤ 0,
which clearly leads to a contradiction to the hypothesis, then we can arrive at the
conclusion that
∀x(0) ∈ ✵ ⇒ η ∈ Ω ⇒ ξ ∈ Ω,∀t ≥ 0.
For the case when t ∈ [T1,∞), the disturbance information has been estimated
precisely, then we have ε = 0.
With the above discussions, (5.23) can be rewritten as
V˙(ξ ) ≤ −(L−c1 −c2)kξ k
2 +E
2
, t ∈ [0,T1),
V˙(ξ ) ≤ −(L−c1)kξ k
2
, t ∈ [T1,∞). (5.31)
Combining with the selection guideline of L, i.e., (5.28), the closed-loop sys￾tem (5.1)–(5.15)–(5.22) is asymptotically stable. Hence, lim
t→∞
ξ (t) = 0 can be
achieved, i.e., lim
t→∞
x(t) = x
∗
(t).
It means that the nonrecursive robust controller proposed in this section can
achieve the control objective of exact tracking, i.e., lim
t→∞
y = yr
. This completes
the proof of Theorem 5.3. 
5.3.4 An illustrative example
Consider the offset-free tracking control problem of a single-link manipulator to

u is the control input of the system, usually referring to the electro-mechanical
torque. D = 1 kg ·m2
is the mechanical inertia. B = 1N·m·s·rad−1
is the co￾efficient of viscous friction. N = 10 is a constant whose value is related to
the mass of the load and the coefficient of gravity. M = 1H is armature reac￾tance. Hm = 1.0 Ω is armature resistance. Km = 0.2N·m·A

is the back EMF
coefficient.
Letting x1 = q, x2 = q˙, x3 = τ, then system (5.32) can be rewritten in the
following form:

x˙1 = x2,
x˙2 = x3 −x2 −10 sin(x1) +τd1

x˙3 = u−0.2x2 −x3 +τd2

In the subsequent simulation, set yr = sin(t) + cos(t + π/3) and the distur￾bances as τd1 = 2+0.5cos(2t), τd2 = 0.5e
−t
.
Then, according to the above-mentioned controller design process, one can
utilize the high-order sliding mode disturbance observer to estimate τd1

In what follows, we will first show the uniform boundness of trajectory ξ ,
and then prove that a local finite-time convergence can be achieved.
1) Uniform boundness: In this regard, we shall prove that for any non-zero
initial states satisfying η(0) ∈ [−(ρ + ρ¯),(ρ + ρ¯)]n
, all the trajectories of η(t)
and ξ (t) will stay in Ω forever.
If the above statement is not true, that is, at least one trajectory of η(t) will
escape Ω within a finite-time. Regarding the finite-time escaping phenomenon,
two cases described in Figure 5.3 will be discussed as follows.
Case 1: There exist two time instants t2 > t1 > 0, such that
i) U˙(ξ (t1)) < 0,
ii) U(ξ (t2)) = U(ξ (t1)) > δ, (5.44)
iii) U˙(ξ (t2)) > 0.
It is clear that for t ∈ [t1,t2], η(t) ∈ Ω. Hence with the propositions analyzed
above, (5.41), (5.42), and (5.43), the following relation can be obtained from
(5.40):

It is noted that (5.45) implies
U(ξ (t2))−U(ξ (t1)) =  t2

U˙(ξ (s))ds < 0.
Recalling the relation ii) of (5.44), it will lead to an obvious contradiction,
i.e.,
0 =

U˙(ξ (s))ds < 0.

∆r = c0,
ii) U˙(ξ (t3)) > 0,
iii) U(ξ (t3)) > δ. (5.46)
In this case, we know that ∀t ∈ [0,t3], η(t) ∈ Ω and ξ (t) ∈ Ω. Similarly with
(5.45), we have
U˙(ξ (t3)) ≤ −(αL−α˜ −α¯)µ

which clearly contradicts the claim ii) in (5.46).
In a summary of the above two cases, we can arrive at the conclusion that
∀x(0) ∈ ✵ ⇒ η(t) ∈ Ω ⇒ ξ (t) ∈ Ω, ∀t ≥ 0.
2) Local finite-time convergence: Now it is true that the relation (5.45) also
holds for t ∈ [0,T1]. With this relation in mind, we know that any trajectory of the108  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
closed-loop system (5.20)–(5.38) will be well defined. In the case when t ≥ T1,
it concludes from Lemma 5.1 that εi = 0, t ≥ T1, i ∈ N1:n. Based on (5.43) and
(5.45), one can also have
U˙(ξ ) +U

≤ 0, t ∈ [T1,∞). (5.47)
By Lemma 1.4 and with the fact that 0 <
2
2−τ < 1 in mind, the relation (5.47)
leads to a straightforward conclusion that there exists another time instant T2 >
T1 > 0, such that y(t)−yr = 0, t ∈ [T2,∞).
This completes the proof of Theorem 5.4. 
Remark 5.2 In the proof of Theorem 5.4, a delicate contradiction argument is
employed to guarantee the avoidance of finite-time escaping phenomenon. Under
the framework of nonrecursive homogeneous domination approach, we first show
that under the guideline (5.43), the semi-global attractivity of the level set Ω can be
ensured via a contradiction argument, and then all signals in the closed-loop sys￾tem will be uniformly bounded. Moreover, by Lyapunov function based analysis, the
finite-time convergence property of the system states is eventually guaranteed.
5.4.3 Extensions
Consider the case when the mismatched disturbances in the system (5.1) satisfy
Assumption 5.2.1, one could also directly obtain the following theorem.
Theorem 5.5
Under Assumptions 3.1.1 and 5.2.1, consider the closed-loop system consisting of
system (5.1), finite-time disturbance observer (5.3) and the controller (5.38) with
a sufficiently large scaling gain L which is dependent on the compact set ✵. The
following statements hold:
 Any trajectory x(t) starting from ✵ will be uniformly bounded.
 The closed-loop system is locally finite-time stable.
Proof: By recalling Theorem 5.1, it is noted that besides the convergence
analysis of the disturbance observer, the remainder of the proof of Theorem 5.5
is almost identical to the proof of Theorem 5.4 and hence is omitted here. 
In addition, if the exosystems of the disturbances are very difficult to be iden￾tified, a practical tracking control result under the proposed nonrecursive synthe￾sis framework is easier to be implemented in practice.Nonrecursive Robust Output Regulation for Nonlinear Systems  109
Corollary 5.1
Under Assumptions 3.1.1 and 5.2.2, consider the closed-loop system consisting of
system (5.1) and the composite controller (5.12)–(5.38). For any trajectory x(t) start￾ing from ✵, there exists a sufficiently large scaling gain L such that the closed-loop
system can be rendered semi-globally practically stable.
Proof: The proof is very similar to the proof of Theorem 5.5, thus is omitted
here and left for the readers. 
5.4.4 Illustrative examples and numerical simulations
Aiming to clarify the difference of nonsmooth and smooth control framework,
consider a simple second-order system whose expression is presented as follows:
Example 5.4.1 Consider the following 2-D nonlinear system:



x˙1 = x2 +sin(x1) +d1,
x˙2 = u+x1x2 +d2,
y = x1,
(5.48)
where d1 and d2 are the matched and mismatched disturbances of the system,
respectively.
In order to achieve the high-precision tracking control objective of the sys￾tem, based on the method in [69], its composite controller can be expressed as
the following form:
d1 :

1 = q1(x1 − p1),

can be described as:

(5.50)
In subsequent simulations, by setting yr = 1+0.5cos(t+ π/4) and selecting
the disturbance dynamics as d1 = sin(0.5t + π/3), d2 = cos(t) + sin(0.5t), us￾ing two different control strategies (recursive and nonrecursive algorithm), the
following simulation results can be obtained, as shown in Figure 5.4.
The recursive controller parameters are set as: [k1, k2,q1, q2] = [6,10,28,32].
The nonrecursive controller parameters are: [l1,0,l1,1,l1,2,λ1] = [12,13,14,1],
[l2,0,l2,1,λ2] = [12,13,1], and [k1, k2,L, τ] = [25,18,3,−0.1].
It can be seen from Figure 5.4(a) that both control strategies can achieve the
precise tracking control target of the system (5.48). What is worth paying atten￾tion to is that by comparing (5.49) and (5.50), it can be clearly observed that
the control law (5.50) has a more concise form, and the nonrecursive controllerNonrecursive Robust Output Regulation for Nonlinear Systems  111

mainly depends on the nominal model of the system, while the nonlinear term
and its partial differential term are not directly reflected in the control law, which
is essentially different with the recursive control algorithm such as the backstep￾ping method.
Example 5.4.2 Consider the following 3-D disturbed nonlinear system:



x˙1 = x2 +sin(x1) +d1(t),
x˙2 = x3 +ln(1+x2

1/3
3 +d2(t),
y = x1,
(5.51)
where d1(t) and d2(t) are mismatched and matched disturbances, respectively.
The control objective is to realize finite-time exact tracking of a given refer￾ence signal yr = 1 + √
2 sin(t + π/4) while the disturbances are set as d1 =
0.1 sin(t), d2 = 1.
In what follows, we show that by considering a semi-global control objec￾tive, the exact tracking control problem for Example 5.4.2 can now be solved by
following a simple synthesis procedure presented in this section.112  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

In the simulation, by following the proposed design procedure, the gain
vector K can be selected following the classical pole placement manner. The
gain parameter is set as K = [27,27,9] to place the pole of the nominal sys￾tem into (−3,−3,−3). The scaling gain is selected as L = 1.5 according to
the guideline (5.43). The designed homogeneous degree is set as τ = −0.1.
The observer gains are chosen as λ1 = 1, l1,0 = 5, l1,1 = 4, l1,2 = 2, l1,3 = 1,
and λ2 = 2, l2,0 = 2, l2,1 = 1. The initial values are given as [x(0);z(0)] =
[3,2,−4; 3,−1,0,−1,−4,0]. For the backstepping based controller, the parame￾ters are set as k1 = 0.51, k2 = 0.02, k3 = 0.51, λ1 = 2.3, and λ2 = 5 while the
initial value for the disturbance observer is [p1(0), p2(0)] = [3,−4].
As shown in Figure 5.5, the finite-time tracking objective is realized under the
designed tracking scheme while the backstepping controller could only render a
practical tracking result. Figure 5.7 shows that under the proposed method, the

To better demonstrate the efficacy of the disturbance attenuation ability en￾abled by the proposed composite method, a comparison result with a practical
nonsmooth controller and a composite backstepping controller is given. The
practical controller is achieved simply by replacing ˆzi in (5.59) to zero, i.e.,
the practical controller is designed without the disturbance estimation and feed￾forward compensation processes. Based on a recent result in [69], a composite116  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

where λ, k1, k2, k3, ε are positive design parameters.
In the simulation, we choose the saturation threshold M = 16, and two neg￾ative degrees τ = −0.1, ω = −0.15 respectively, the finite-time disturbance ob￾server gain vector is set to be H = [15,75,125,90]
> and the design parameter
σ = 2. The control parameters for the proposed composite controller and prac￾tical nonsmooth controller are selected the same as K = [27,27,9] to place the
poles to [−3,−3,−3], and the scaling gain is set to be L = 5 according to the
guideline (5.43). The control gain parameters for the composite backstepping
controller (5.62) are chosen as ε = 8, λ = 10, k1 = 2.9, k2 = k3 = 0.1. To conduct
the simulation, the initial values are given as [x(0)|zˆ(0)] = [1,−1,0|0,0,0,0].
It is shown in Figure 5.9 that the finite-time exact tracking objective is real￾ized under the proposed controller (5.59) while the practical controller can only
render a practical tracking result. Even the composite backstepping controller can
achieve a satisfactory practical tracking control result, however the steady state
error cannot be fully eliminated. Moreover, it is easy to discover that the con￾trol expression (5.62) is much more complex than the proposed controller (5.59).
In Figure 5.10, the performance of the designed disturbance observer (5.58) is

Nonrecursive Adaptive
Output Regulation for
Nonlinear Systems with
Mismatched Disturbances
In Chapter 5, for nonlinear systems with mismatched disturbances, a nonrecur￾sive robust output regulation law design method has been proposed. Notably,
it embodies a natural robust handling strategy in which the controllers are nor￾mally determined by the worst scenario aiming to maintain the system stability
under various disturbance variation conditions. Consequently, the overconser￾vative gain-configuration mechanism may lead to robustness redundancy of the
closed-loop system, yielding a fact that the transient-time control performance
may degrade with the wide range of operating conditions switching.
In order to further clarify the motivation of this chapter, take a DC-DC con￾verter control issue feeding constant power loads (CPLs) as an example. On the
one hand, in the case that the CPL varies from a small-signal perturbation case to
a large-signal case, setting a sufficiently large bandwidth could possibly meet the
voltage regulation requirement and ensure system stability. On the other hand, if
the working condition varies from a large-signal perturbation case into a small￾signal case with a fixed bandwidth determined in a robust control manner, pos￾sible deterioration of the transient-time control performance would render the
DC output voltage regulation result deviating from the demanded performance
indexes. Whereas, for power electronics systems, large overshoot and fluctuation
DOI: 10.1201/9781003399230-6 121122  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
are harmful to practical applications. Accordingly, a self-tuning bandwidth fac￾tor of the controller would largely benefit the practical implementation of such
industrial regulators.
Motivated by the above discussions, this chapter presents an alternative adap￾tive tracking control design algorithm for a class of nonlinear systems with the
presence of mismatched disturbances. As an alternative control design approach
for practitioners, a simple nonsmooth tracking scheme with a self-tuning scal￾ing gain is proposed under a nonrecursive synthesis framework. In reference to
the existing related works, a main distinguishable feature is that the scaling gain
of the proposed regulation law can be adaptively adjusted subject to different
perturbation levels, therefore, the control system is able to achieve an improved
transient-time control performance while an accurate tracking objective is guar￾anteed. In addition, the proposed nonrecursive design philosophy is able to obtain
a simplest state-feedback expression of the controller through essentially detach￾ing the stability analysis from the controller design procedure, i.e., without going
through the recursive determination steps of classical virtual controllers and tun￾ing functions.
6.1 Linear Nonrecursive Adaptive Output Regulation
In this section, we consider a linear nonrecursive adaptive output regulation prob￾lem for the disturbed nonlinear system of form (5.1) under Assumptions 3.1.1
and 5.2.2.
6.1.1 System pre-treatment
Following a similar coordinate transformation to (5.19), the following change of
coordinates is presented:

L

, (6.1)
where L ≥ 1 is a dynamic scaling gain, υ is an interaction controller, and ρ > 0
is a design parameter determined later on.
To proceed, define (A,B) as the nth-order controllable canonical matrix pair,
and a positive definite, symmetrical matrix P ∈ R
n×n
satisfying
(A−BK)
>P+P(A−BK) ≤ −In,
where K = (k1, k2,··· , kn) is the coefficient of a Hurwitz polynomial H(s) =

n−1 +···+k1, and In is the identity matrix.Nonrecursive Adaptive Output Regulation for Nonlinear Systems  123
In what follows, the symbol Θ is further denoted as Θ , diag{0,1,··· ,n−1}.
Then, the restriction of design parameter ρ can be derived:

At this stage, without going through any complex calculations, one can obtain
the following implementable adaptive controller:

Remark 6.1 For parameter selection, the following principles or steps can be fol￾lowed: 1) Obtain the control gain K through the pole configuration, and configure
the pole of the closed-loop system to the desired pole; 2) Calculate the linear ma￾trix inequality (A − BK)
>P + P(A − BK) ≤ −In, so as to obtain a positive definite
symmetric matrix P; 3) According to the selection criteria of the parameter ρ, de￾termine its range; 4) One can calculate the range of c1, c2, c3, c4 according to their
corresponding selection criteria, and they can be simply selected by “trial and error”

Under Assumptions 3.1.1 and 5.2.2, assuming the system initial values satisfying
[x(0),µˆ(0)]> ∈ ✵ , [−ρ,ρ]

system including the original system (5.1), the finite-time disturbance observer (5.15)

First of all, the following relationship holds:
V(η,µ˜ ≤ λmax(P)kηk

where γ(t) = µ˜
2/(2ϖ1).
1) Denote a set as Ω1 = {η ∈ R
n
|V(η,µ˜) ≤ σ0}. Then, there must exist Ω1 ⊂
ΩM. Besides, from (6.6), one can get that for any state trajectory (η,µ˜) satisfying
µ˜(0) ∈ Ωµ ,η(0) ∈ Ωη∗ ∩(ΩM\Ω1) must stay in ΩM, and will be captured by Ω.
Otherwise, there exists a finite time instant t2 > 0, such that
i) V(0) ≤ V(t2) = M +NE2
ii) V˙(t2) ≥ 0.
Then for t ∈ [0,t2], the inequality (6.10) holds, and further

≤ −L(1−ϖ3)λ
−1
max(P)(V2 −γ −σ0/2)
< 0,
which clearly contradicts the hypothesis, i.e., 0 ≤V˙(t2) < 0. Then it is clear that:
∀µ˜(0) ∈ Ωµ ,η(0) ∈ Ωη∗ ∩(ΩM\Ω1) ⇒ (η,µ˜) ∈ ΩM,∀t ≥ 0,
that is, when ΩM is a fixed set, η(t) will be captured by Ω1.
2) When t ≥ T1, (6.10) can be rewritten as
V˙ ≤ −L(1−ϖ3)kηk
2 ≤ 0,
which also concludes at the boundness of (η,µ˜).
Now we are able to conclude that η and µ˜ are uniformly bounded. Subse￾quently, the boundness of the scaling gain L will be claimed.
Notably, L˙ ≥ 0 is constantly established. For ease of description, suppose
that L is unbounded, that is, there must exist a finite time instant t3, such that
c2L(t3) > µ¯¯ +c3, where µ¯¯ is the maximum value of µˆ , hence L(t3) > (µ¯¯ +c3)/c2.
1) In the case that µ¯¯ +c3 ≤ c2, µ¯¯ +c3−c2L(t3) ≤ µ¯¯ +c3−c2 ≤ 0 holds. From
(6.4), L˙ = 0, i.e., ∀t > 0,L = L(0) ≡ 1.
2) In the case that µ¯¯ + c3 > c2, µ¯¯ + c3 − c2L(0) > 0, µ¯¯ + c3 − c2L(t3) < 0
exists. Then there exists a time instant t0 ∈ (0,t3), such that µ¯¯ +c3 −c2L(t0) = 0,
i.e.,
∀t ∈ (t0,t3), µ¯¯ +c3 −c2L(t) < 0, L˙ = 0, L ≡ L(t0) = µ¯¯ +c3
c2
,
which is clearly inconsistent with the assumption. In this case, one gets
∀t ∈ [t0,t3), L ≡ L(t0) = (µ¯¯ +c3)/c2.Nonrecursive Adaptive Output Regulation for Nonlinear Systems  127
Summarily, L is uniformly bounded, i.e., L has an upper value L¯ satisfying
L¯ = max{1,(µ¯¯ +c3)/c2}.
b) States converge asymptotically to the reference value:

Hence, combining with (6.3), (6.7) and η ∈ ΩM, the conclusion that η˙ , Q¨ =
2(η1η˙ 1 + η2η˙ 2 + ··· + ηnη˙ n) are uniformly bounded. Then we have lim

Q˙ =

This completes the proof of Theorem 6.1. 
6.1.4 Numerical simulations
In this subsection, we consider the system in Example 5.3.1. Based on the pro￾posed adaptive controller design procedure, the nonrecursive adaptive controller
can be designed as follows:

The parameters for the adaptive law are set as [c1, c2, c3, c4,ρ;K

[10,1,0.02,10,3; 15,18,22] while all the other parameters are the same with Ex￾ample 5.3.1.

To these aims, the composite dynamic controller proposed in this section can
be depicted as the following compact form:

L˙ = φ(L, x,zˆ, yr), L(0) = L0 = 1. (6.13)

constant and δ ∈ R+ being an arbitrary small tolerance, such that under As￾sumption 3.1.1, the resulting closed-loop system (5.1)–(6.13) can be rendered
semi-globally practically stable.
In what follows, we will present an explicit nonrecursive controller construc￾tion procedure, which is composed of disturbance observation, the reconstruction
of output regulation function, and the design of a one-step control law.

where Γη can be any given compact set, a3 is a positive constant which is depen￾dent on Γη , a2,a4 are two positive constants and D∗
is a positive constant related
to D but independent of L.
For the purpose of facilitating the organization, the detailed analysis is listed
in the following steps.
A: The Boundness of L
In this regard, we shall figure out the boundness of L(t). As depicted in dy￾namic updating mechanism (6.19), L(t) is a monotone non-decreasing gain func￾tion, and specifically, the discussion about the growth rate of L should be split
into the following two parts.Nonrecursive Adaptive Output Regulation for Nonlinear Systems  133
Part I: In the case when |es
| ≥ δ, assume that L(t) will escape at a finite time
tf
, i.e., lim
t:tf
L(t) = ∞. For arbitrary large compact set Γη and η ∈ Γη , there should
exist a time instant t∗ ∈ [0,tf), such that L(t∗) = a3+a4+1
a2
. Then for t ∈ [t∗,tf),
substituting (6.21) and (6.22) into (6.20), it yields

Then, taking the assumption listed above into consideration, the following
expression gives:

= constant, (6.24)
which results in a clear contradiction. Therefore, a preliminary conclusion can
be drawn that for |es
| ≥ δ, the scaling gain L(t) is bounded.
Part II: For |es
| < δ, the direct relationship can be depicted as L˙ = 0. Accord￾ingly, it is obvious that L(t) can converge immediately to a certain constant.
Conclusively, at this point, we are able to declare that L(t) is well defined and
bounded in the time interval t ∈ [0,∞).
B: Semi-global Uniform Boundness
In what follows, we will prove that for t ∈ [t∗,∞), all signals of the closed￾loop system are semi-globally uniformly bounded. To see why, noting from
the uniform boundness feature of system (5.13), for any well-defined x(t) ∈

, there exists a positive constant ρ¯

such that max
i∈N1:n
{sup

Subsequently, we are capable of defining a level set as
Ω ,

where ξi = xi −x

.
Simultaneously, with L ≥ 1 and the transformation that ηi = ξi/L
ρ+i−1
, we
get that ∀ξ (t) ∈ Ω ⇒ η(t) ∈ Ω.
In what follows, by employing the contradiction argument, suppose that η(t)
will escape Ω within a finite time instant. According to the finite-time escapin134  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

Thereafter, for any tolerance m ∈ [( 2D∗

have
V˙(η(t1)) ≤ −αV 2
2−κ
max +D∗ < −αm 2
2−κ +D∗ ≤ −2D∗ +D∗ < 0, (6.26)
which leads to an obvious contradiction with (6.25).
In summary of the statements above, the conclusion can be depicted that
∀x(0) ∈ Γx ⇒ ξ ∈ Ω ⇒ η ∈ Ω,∀t ≥ 0.
C: Local Practical Stability
Define a set as Ω1 = {ξ ∈ Rn|V(ξ ) ≤ m}. Clearly, Ω1 ⊂ Ω holds. Subse￾quently, we shall show that for any state satisfying ξ (t∗) ∈ Γξ ∩ (Ω\Ω1), the
corresponding trajectory of ξ (t) will stay in Ω forever and be captured by Ω1.
From Step 2, we know that at the certain time constant t1, the contradiction
between (6.25) and (6.26) similarly occurs once applying the contradiction argu￾ment for the statement above. Hence, based on the semi-global boundness, we
further know that the trajectory ξ (t) will be captured by the level set Ω1. Then,
it is clear that the local practical convergence can be guaranteed, that is, there
exists a finite-time T > 0, such that |es| ≤ δ,∀t ≥ T.
This completes the proof of Theorem 6.2.

case, a nonrecursive nonsmooth robust composite controller (5.38) and a recur￾sive composite controller are employed for performance comparisons. The for￾mer controller is implemented by setting L˙ in (6.30) as zero. Notably, owing to
the worst-case design strategy, the fixed L should be a sufficiently large positive
value. Based on the result developed in [69], a composite backstepping controller
employing a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) can be constructed as:

[k1, k2, k3] = [27,27,9]; [ρ,λ,δ] = [0.01,0.008,0.005]. Further, the design pa￾rameters of the nonsmooth robust composite controller are similar to the pro￾posed controller and the fixed L is set as 8. The control gains of the com￾posite backstepping controller are chosen as [c1, c2] = [80,42]; [σ1,σ2,σ3] =
[36,36,12]. To carry out the simulation, the initial values are given as x(0) =

The output tracking control results are depicted in Figure 6.4. The response
curves of the states x2, x3 are shown in Figure 6.5. Figure 6.6 shows the con￾trol input signals and the convergence trajectory of the dynamic gain L. Clearly,
the proposed tracking control objective can be realized via all candidate ap￾proaches. Compared with the nonsmooth robust controller, the proposed algo￾rithm could yield a smoother transient-time control performance at the small
disturbance working condition. With the presence of large signal disturbances,
the nonsmooth robust controller and the proposed strategy have shown a very
similar control performance owing to the fact the dynamic scaling gain L has
converged to a similar value with the case in the robust controller. Compared
with the composite backstepping controller, the proposed controller expression
is much simpler, as can be observed from (6.30) and (6.31). Moreover, the track-Nonrecursive Adaptive Output Regulation for Nonlinear Systems  137

composite backstepping controller.
Case 2. The homogeneous degree selection: In this case, we conduct a series
of simulation studies to illustrate the control performance affected by the selec￾tion of different homogeneous degrees in the proposed nonsmooth controller.
On the one hand, as depicted in Figure 6.7, for the large level of disturbance
signals, a smaller κ will clearly lead to a faster convergence speed and a lower
steady error. However, for smaller disturbances, a smaller κ may result in a more
aggressive transient-time response. On the other hand, the nonsmooth dynamic
controller tends to approach the smooth linear controller in the case when the

time but smoother transient-time control performance.
Remark 6.2 As illustrated in the numerical simulation process, the parameter se￾lection guidelines of the proposed dynamic controller can be briefly discussed as the
following procedures: a) The homogeneous degrees are chosen as a value approxi￾mate to zero, first; b) The traditional linear pole placement method can be employed
to determine the control gain K; c) By solving a joint linear matrix inequality (LMI)
related to P as stated above, matrix P can be subsequently calculated; d) Tune the
homogeneous degrees to be slightly smaller according to design requirement; e) The
range of ρ can be calculated by (6.17), and generally, it can be chosen as a small
positive number. Additionally, the scaling gains of L˙(t), i.e., λ,δ which are critical

Application to Permanent
Magnet Synchronous
Motor Systems
7.1 Introduction
Permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) has been widely applied in elec￾tric vehicles, robots, servo systems, and aerospace applications due to its simple
design, compact structure, and high energy density [75], [65]. Specifically, as the
electric vehicle market has grown rapidly in recent years, PMSM has gradually
replaced AC induction motors as the mainstream electric drive system. However,
due to the fact that PMSM has multivariable, strong coupling, and nonlinear
characteristics, it is a challenging job to achieve high accuracy and performance
speed closed loop control of the PMSM systems. Therefore, in recent years, in or￾der to improve the dynamic performance and disturbance rejection capability of
PMSM drive systems, abundant advanced control methods have been proposed
in the literature, which can be roughly divided into cascade and non-cascade
control strategies according to the control structure. The cascade control consists
of an outer speed loop and an inner current loop, the speed control strategies
based on this structure are currently the main choice. It is worth noting that in
the non-cascade control structure, the current loop is omitted, which avoids the
bandwidth limitation problem in cascade control and thus improves the system’s
dynamic performance. However, under the non-cascade structure, disturbances
in the current loop are mismatched, which enter the system via a different chan￾nel from the control input. Mainly caused by external load torques, unmodeled

dynamics and parameter perturbations, the mismatched disturbances have nega￾tive impact on system performance and stability [10]. To improve the system’s
ability to suppress disturbances and uncertainties, several control strategies com￾bined with disturbance observer have been proposed [70, 84]. However, how to
achieve the balance between system robustness while maintaining the dynamic
control performance is still a significant issue.
In this chapter, we will apply the proposed theoretical nonrecursive control
results to provide a simple controller design method considering mismatched
disturbances for the speed control problem of PMSM drive systems under a non￾cascaded control structure, which can significantly improve the dynamic perfor￾mance of the system while guaranteeing the system robustness against external
disturbances and uncertainties. Meanwhile, the parameter tuning is intuitive and
computational burden is light, which naturally is very easy to be implemented in
low-cost microprocessors.
In addition, to provide engineers with a clearer and more intuitive under￾standing of the structure and parameter design of the controller, each control
parameter’s effect on system performance is simulated in this chapter via the
MATLAB/Simulink platform, which is a helpful instruction for the further ap￾plication of the proposed control method to practical engineering.
7.2 Modeling of PMSM
To begin with, the three phase voltage and flux chain equations are given as
follows:



uA = Rs
iA +Ψ˙
A
uB = Rs
iB +Ψ˙

uC = Rs

ΨC = Ls
iC + M(iA +iB) +ψf cos(θ −

(7.2)
where iA,iB, and iC are stator winding current of the A,B, and C phases respec￾tively; Rs
is the stator resistance; Ls
is the stator inductance; M is the stator mutual
inductance; ψf
is the rotor flux linkage; and θ is the electric angle.
Aiming at the three-phase stator winding adopting the Y-connection, the sta￾tor current satisfies the following relationship:
iA +iB +iC = 0. (7.3)Application to Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Systems  143
Combining with (7.1), (7.2), (7.3), one can get that:



ΨA = (Ls − M)iA +ψf cosθ
ΨB = (Ls − M)iB +ψf cos(θ −

3
)
ΨC = (Ls − M)iC +ψf cos(θ −
4π
3
).
(7.4)
Substituting (7.4) in (7.1) yields:



uA = Rs
iA + (Ls − M)
˙iA −ψfωe sinθ
uB = Rs
iB + (Ls − M)
˙iB −ψfωe sin(θ −

uC = Rs
iC + (Ls − M)
˙iC −ψfωe sin(θ −
4π
3
),
(7.5)
where ωe is the electrical angular velocity.
The transformation from a three-phase stationary coordinate system to α-β
two-phase one can be performed by adopting the Clarke coordinate transforma￾tion with the following relations:


(7.6)
Subsequently, the voltage equation in α-β axis can be attained by substituting
(7.5) in (7.6)
(
uα = Rs
iα +Ls
˙iα −weψf sinθ
uβ = Rs
iβ +Ls
˙iβ +weψf cosθ.
(7.7)
Furthermore, transform α-β axis to the rotational one d-q utilizing the fol￾lowing Park transformation:
(
d = α cosθ +β sinθ
q = −α sinθ +β cosθ.
(7.8)
Combining (7.7) with (7.8), one can obtain the voltage equation of PMSM in
d-q axis in the following form:
(
ud = Rs
id +Ls
˙id −ωeLs
iq
uq = Rs
iq +Ls
˙iq +ωe(Ls

(7.9)144  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
Consequently, the equations of electromagnetic torque and motor motion in
d-q axis system are expressed in the following form:

where J is the rotor inertia, np is the number of pole pairs, B is the viscous

Combining (7.9) with (7.10), the mathematical model of a surface-mounted
motor in the d-q coordinates frame is further stated as:

where Kq = [kq1, kq2] with kq1 > 0, kq2 > 0, and Kd > 0.
7.3.2 Simulation studies
Parameters selection: In this simulation, the observer gains are configured as:
l1,0 = 10, l1,1 = 7, l1,2 = 4, λ1 = 1.9 × 107
; l2,0 = 11, l2,1 = 3, λ2 = 1.55 × 105
;
l3,0 = 4, l3,1 = 3, λ3 = 1.35×104
. The controller gains are configured as: Kq =
[0.02,0.01], Lq = 1.1, τq = −0.05, Kd = 0.1, Ld = 1.1, τd = −0.05.
The test scenario is that the system reference speed is switched from 500 rpm
to 1000 rpm at 1s, followed by a sudden load disturbance of 30% of the nominal
torque (0.08 Nm) at 1.5 s, where the parameters of PMSM are listed in Table 7.1
and the control frequency is set as 20 kHz.
As can be observed from Figure 7.1, the response speed and disturbance re￾jection ability of the control system are markedly improved as kq1 increases while146  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

other parameters remain the same, but an excessive kq1 may cause the system
chattering phenomenon. From Figure 7.2, one can naturally find that the parame￾ter kq2 can regulate the system damping, and the larger the parameter, the stronger
the damping, which can effectively alleviate the issue of large overshoot of the
system caused by the kq1 being oversized. Nevertheless, it will deteriorate the
dynamic performance of the system when the parameters are excessively large.
Consequently, the satisfactory dynamic performance can be achieved by choos￾ing a appropriate group of kq1 and kq2. The parameter Lq can tune the system
bandwidth, and its simulation results are shown in Figure 7.3, which demon￾strates that the increase of Lq can improve the response speed and disturbance
rejection ability. τq provides a new dimension of the regulatory control perfor￾mance, and the simulation results are shown in Figure 7.4. It is straightforward
to see that the presence of the parameter τq can significantly affect the system
dynamic response. While due to the mathematical properties of the fractional or￾der itself, compared to the traditional linear feedback control laws, a significant
improvement can be achieved in the system robustness against uncertainties and
disturbances.
Performance verification: In this simulation, we choose a relatively suit￾able set of composite controller parameters as possible, where the observer

parameters are set as: l1,0 = 10, l1,1 = 7, l1,2 = 4, λ1 = 1.9×107; l2,0 = 11, l2,1 = 3,
λ2 = 1.55 × 105; l3,0 = 4, l3,1 = 3, λ3 = 1.35 × 104. The control parameters are
set as: Kq = [0.02,0.03], Lq = 1.25, τq = −0.1, Kd = 0.05, Ld = 1.2, τd = −0.1,
and the PMSM parameters are given in Table 7.1 with the sampling frequency of
20 kHz. The test scenario is divided into the following stages: at first, the speed
reference is switched from 500 rpm to 1000 rpm at 1 s, followed by a sudden load
disturbance of 0.08 Nm on the motor at 2 s, then a sinusoidal load disturbance of
0.08sin(2πt) Nm on the motor at 3 s, and finally the sinusoidal disturbance is
removed at 5 s. The initial values of the closed-loop system are chosen as 0.
As is clearly depicted by Figure 7.5 (a), in the presence of unknown load
torque variation, the speed regulation objective can still be well achieved un￾der the proposed robust controller. The response curves of iq, id and the time
histories of two control inputs uq, ud are presented in Figures 7.5 (b) and (c),
which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the designed HOSM disturbance
observer depicted in Eqs. (7.15) and (7.16).

7.3.3 Experimental tests
To further validate the effectiveness of the designed controller, the experimental
setup has been constructed and its setting is shown in Figure 7.6. The control and
driver circuits adopted are the F28379D Launched Pad and DRV-8305 developed
by Texas Instrument. The PMSM parameters are listed in Table 7.1, and the
sampling frequency is 20 kHz, where a conventional cascaded PI speed controller
is used as the comparison group. Specifically, the control parameters are given
as: l1,0 = 13, l1,1 = 7, l1,2 = 3, λ1 = 4.85×105; l2,0 = 11, l2,1 = 6, λ2 = 6×104;
l3,0 = 4, l3,1 = 3, λ3 = 3500. Kq = [0.04,0.025], Lq = 1.2, τq = −0.15, Kd = 0.1,
Ld = 1.2, τd = −0.15 for the proposed robust controller; kd p = 2.31, kdi = 0.28,
kpp = 2, kpi = 6.66×10−4 for the cascaded PI controller.
For more detailed demonstration of dynamic performance and disturbance
rejection of the proposed controller, the experimental validation is considered as
two scenarios: the first test scenario is that the reference speed switches from
500 rpm to 1000 rpm at 5 s followed by a sudden load disturbance of 0.1 Nm
at 7 s, similarly, the second test scenario is that the reference speed switches
from 500 rpm to 1000 rpm at 5 s, while a sinusoidal load disturbance of form
0.1sin(4πt) Nm is applied at 7 s.
As can be visually observed in Figure 7.7, the dynamic performance of the
proposed controller is significantly improved compared to the cascaded PI con￾troller. Further, after the disturbance is added at t = 7 s, the PI controller suffers a
large speed drop, while the proposed nonsmooth composite controller still works
well with only a slight drop. Subsequently, in Figure 7.8, the time-varying distur￾bance is applied at 7 s. It can be clearly seen that the conventional PI controller150  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
Figure 7.7 Experiment results of the reference speed switches from 500 rpm to

shows large fluctuation in that the frequency is the same as the applied load dis￾turbance. In contrast, the proposed controller shows desirable robustness to the
time-varying disturbance, with only tiny fluctuation. Consequently, one can con￾clude that the proposed control method is able to improve the dynamic perfor￾mance, the ability to suppress disturbances and system uncertainties compared
to the traditional cascaded PI control method.Application to Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Systems  151

Furthermore, we introduce the following transformation x1 = ωref − ω, x2 =

TL is re￾garded as the mismatched disturbance, and d2 is the matched disturbance which
contains unmodeled dynamic or measurement errors, etc.
At this point, we have transferred the rotating speed regulation problem into a

7.4.1.2 Experimental tests
In the following experimental tests, the parameters of the PMSM are listed in
Table 7.1, and the control switching frequency is 15 kHz. The experiments are
implemented from two perspectives. On the one hand, in addition to the pro￾posed linear dynamic nonrecursive controller, the other two existing contApplication to Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Systems  153

methodologies are chosen as the benchmark control group, that are, the tra￾ditional double-loop PI control and the Generalized Predictive Control (GPC)
method [87], aiming to conduct the performance comparison. On the other hand,
the speed regulation working conditions of the PMSM are essential to be rig￾orously designed. Concretely, the test procedures are classified as the following
cases: the reference speed switches from 500 rpm to 1500 rpm, from 500 rpm to
3000 rpm, respectively, with the presence of TL = 0.018 Nm. Additionally, for
the purpose of validating the anti-disturbance ability of the candidate controllers,
the TL switches from 0.018 Nm to 0.018 sin(t) Nm in the last cases under a fixed
speed of 1500 rpm. The control parameters for the linear adaptive controller are
presented in Table. 7.2.
Scenario 1. the reference speed switches from 500 rpm to 1500 rpm with
TL = 0.018 Nm: The experimental results of this case can be referred to
Figure 7.9. In this case, the worst speed response performance is clearly the PI
controller, whether settling time (0.592 s) or maximum overshoot (129.71 rpm).

Besides, compared with the GPC strategy, the proposed controller has a smoother
response curve, but a slower regulation time, which causes by over strong robust￾ness of the GPC controller form, i.e., unsurprisingly, the conservative horizon
determination leads to a faster response time but a more intense process. The
dynamic scaling gain converges from 1 to 140.45 to 161.03.
Scenario 2. the reference speed switches from 500 rpm to 3000 rpm with
TL = 0.018 Nm: Clearly, from Figure 7.10, the phenomenon occurring to the
PI controller is consistent with Scenario 1, i.e., longest settling time (0.726 s)
and largest overshoot (343.16 rpm). From the perspective of nonrecursive con￾trol, one can find that the output speed behaviors of the GPC controller and lin￾ear dynamic composite controller are quite similar in this case. The philosophy
of this manifestation is that the fixed horizon (bandwidth factor) is artificially
chosen as the most suitable value to confront this case (the worst case in these
experiments), hence, the dynamic performance can be guaranteed. For the pro￾posed dynamic gain design, in this case, the dynamic scaling gain has to tune to
the most conservative value (commonly close to the fixed gain) according to the
self-configuration mechanism, and only in this way can the sudden change of this
severe working condition be suppressed, detailedly, the dynamic gain switches
from 1 to 16.86 to 36.13.
Scenario 3: TL switches from 0.02 Nm to 0.02 sin(t) Nm with the fixed speed
1500 rpm. The experimental results are shown in Figure 7.11. For this scenario,
the output response performance of all candidate controllers has a huge differ￾ence. First of all, the PI controller is unsatisfactory as always with the TL presence
of frequent switching, and the steady-state speed fluctuation seems to be hard to
be accepted. The steady-state speed of the dynamic gain design is relatively moreApplication to Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Systems  155

desirable than the GPC approach, due to the self-tuning gain generated seems to
be more suitable in this condition, which switches from 1 to 78.37 to 142.05,
as shown in Figure 7.12. At the TL operation condition switching moment, the
maximum overshoot of the GPC controller is larger than the proposed controller,
and the obvious speed fluctuation occurs in the PMSM drive system.
The detailed behavior data of the candidate controllers are listed in Table 7.3
for reference. In summary, the controlled design expectancy is basically achieved
in the experimental verification.

In this simulation, the controller parameters are set as: l1,0 = 9, l1,1 = 6, l1,2 = 3,
λ1 = 1.5×107, l2,0 = 8, l2,1 = 2.5, λ2 = 1×105, l3,0 = 4, l3,1 = 5, λ3 = 9.55×
103, k1 = 0.03, k2 = 0,05, κ = −0.15, λ = 5, ρ = 1.1, δ = 0.5, and the control
frequency is 20 kHz. The PMSM parameters are given in Table 7.1. The test
scenario is that the reference speed is switched from 500 rpm to 1000 rpm at 1s,
then the 30% nominal torque, i.e., 0.08 Nm is applied to motor at 1.5 s.
Nonsmooth adaptive control makes parameter tuning easier compared to the
design robust controller in (7.17) due to the introduction of a self-tuning mecha￾nism to adjust the system bandwidth. λ is used to tune the adaptive growth rate,
and the simulation results are presented in Figure 7.13, it can be observed that by
choosing a larger λ the system has a faster response rate. The response curves
for L at different λ are shown in Figure 7.14.
Note that the parameter κ is included in both the adaptive mechanism and
the designed control law. As can be observed in Figure 7.16, the smaller the
choice of κ, the larger the steady value of L. Furthermore, from Figure 7.14,
one can learn that the increase of L can enhance system response, while from
Figures 7.15 and 7.16, one can observe that the increase of L does not have muchApplication to Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Systems  157

impact on dynamic performance of system. As a result, by adjusting κ, it can not
only alleviate the system overshoot problem caused by the excessive L, but also
suppress the defect that introducing fractional order reduces the system response
speed. Naturally, with the appropriate adjustment of the parameter L, one can
achieve the introduction of fractional orders to improve the robustness of system
to external disturbances without deteriorating the dynamic performance of the
system.
ρ is the parameter to regulate the system bandwidth from a new dimension,
and the simulation results are displayed in Figures 7.17 and 7.18, from which it
can be observed that the ρ can suppress the growth rate of the adaptive scaling
gain. With λ, κ chosen appropriately, a slight change in ρ can enable the system
to achieve a better control performance.
7.4.2.3 Experimental tests
In this experiment, the adopted experimental configuration is the same as in the
robust control experiment above as shown in Figure 7.6, and control frequency
is 20 kHz. The cascaded PI speed controller is used as the benchmark controller
for comparison.
Figure 7.16 Response curves of L under different parameter κ.Application to Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Systems  159
Figure 7.17 Speed regulation results under different parameter ρ.
Specifically, the control parameters are given as: l1,0 = 10, l1,1 = 6, l1,2 = 3.5,
λ1 = 6 × 105, l2,0 = 11, l2,1 = 6.5, λ2 = 7 × 104, l3,0 = 4, l3,1 = 3, λ3 = 3500,
k1 = 0.1, k2 = 0.07, δ = 1, λ = 0.25, ρ = 1.1, κ = −0.05 for the proposed robust
controller; kpp = 2, kpi = 6.66 × 10−4, kd p = 2.31, kdi = 0.28 for the cascaded
PI controller. Similarly, the experimental tests are divided into the following two
scenarios: the first scenario is that at 5s, the reference speed is switched from
500 rpm to 2000 rpm, following the load disturbance of 0.12 Nm is applied at 7 s.
In the second one, the reference speed is still switched from 500 rpm to 2000 rpm
at 5 s, while a sinusoidal disturbance of 0.12sin(4πt) Nm is introduced to the
motor at 7 s.
As can be observed from Figure 7.19, the proposed nonrecursive adaptive
controller can quickly track to the new speed reference with minimal overshoot
after the reference switching, and the dynamic performance is satisfactory to the
traditional cascaded PI controller. With the disturbance enforced at 5 s, it can be
observed from Figure 7.19 that the cascaded PI controller shows a large speed
drop, while the proposed nonsmooth adaptive nonrecursive control shows only a
slight speed drop. Similarly, in Figure 7.20, the cascaded PI controller exhibits

the proposed control can regulate speed fluctuations to within 40 rpm.
Consequently, we can obtain from the experiment results above that the pro￾posed composite control method can notably improve the dynamic performance
of the system under the non-cascaded structure, achieving accurate compensa￾tion of mismatched torque disturbance. Compared with the conventional cas￾caded PI controller, a significant performance enhancement in the dynamic per￾formance and disturbance rejection capability of the closed-loop control system
are achieved.Application to Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor Systems  161

Application to Series
Elastic Actuator Systems
8.1 Introduction
Series Elastic Actuators (SEAs) are widely applied in advanced robot applica￾tions due to their advantages over conventional stiff and non-back derivable ac￾tuators in force control, e.g., high fidelity, low cost, low stiction, etc. [41,57,88].
As a sketch review of the related literature, linear controllers constitute a main
choice. Furthermore, the performances can also be improved by using nonlin￾ear control strategies and adding feedforward control loops, see for examples
[51,53,64], only mention a few. However, it is worthy of pointing out that almost
all those existing control applications to SEAs are based on an asymptotical con￾trol result. Due to the apparent advantage of fast convergence rate and stronger
robustness, finite-time output regulation is of significance in the robust motion
control problem for SEAs. One recent work [78] in the literature addresses the
finite-time control problem for SEA by using a terminal sliding-mode control
scheme, where the bothersome chattering issue cannot be avoided. In this section,
we will show that the proposed theoretical result will provide a much easier con￾trol implementation, and meanwhile significant control performance improve￾ments can be achieved compared with the conventional PD and linear state feed￾back controllers, while there are not much added complexities of the gain tuning
mechanism.
In this chapter, we study the advanced control problem for a class of SEA
system with a novel design (as depicted by Figure 8.1) that gives the actuator

different impedances at different force ranges. The actuator has two series of
elastic elements: a linear spring with a low stiffness and a torsional spring with
a high stiffness. Figure 8.1 (a) is a cross section showing the structure of the
studied actuator. The motor (Maxon EC-4-pole brushless DC motor operating at
200 W) shown is coupled to a ball screw through a torsional spring. Two incre￾mental encoders (Renishaw RM22IC) with resolutions of 2048 and 1024 pulses
per revolution are used to measure the angular displacement of the motor shaft
and lead screw respectively.
8.2 Modeling of SEAs
Using the analogy of two-mass-spring-damper system, by neglecting the in￾evitable unmodeled disturbances, one can obtain the nominal mathematical
model of the following form [64]:

in real-time at 1 KHz on a dSPACE DS1007 processor board with the DS3002
incremental encoder board for reading the encoders, while the motor is controlled
using the Elmo Gold Whistle Servo Drive. The involved parameter values of the

8.3 Practically Oriented Finite-Time Control for SEA
8.3.1 Controller design
In this section, we first consider the practically oriented finite-time control prob￾lem for the SEA system. We consider a more practical control objective, namely,166  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
semi-global control, rather than the restrictive global control target. Hence, with￾out any pre-verifications of certain nonlinearity growth conditions, it is straight￾forward to utilize the nonrecursive tracking control approach proposed in Chap￾ter 3 to design a robust finite-time control law (the tracking reference is denoted
by qlre f) to realize the accurate position control for the SEA system.

Step 1: from PD control to state feedback control.
In the starting session, we first implement a conventional PD controller to the
SEA. Figures 8.2–8.3 show the set-point and trajectory tracking performances
under different proportional gains (kp = 0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9 while kd = 0.01), where
qlre f = 0.5(rad) in Figure 8.2 and qlre f = 0.5 sin(5t + ϕ)(rad) in Figure 8.3, re￾spectively. Generally speaking, choosing a larger proportional gain will result in
faster convergence rate, higher precision, but meanwhile, larger overshoot andApplication to Series Elastic Actuator Systems  167

control energy consumption. Without loss of generality, we extend the PD coef￾ficients of the dash lines in Figures 8.2 and 8.3 as the coefficients of linear state
feedback controller, i.e., K = [0.5,0.01,0.1,0.01]. Compared with the dot line in
Figures 8.4 and 8.7, it is obvious to see the progressive tracking performances of
state feedback controller.
Step 2: from state feedback control to finite-time control.
First notice that the proposed finite-time control law (8.3) reduces to a linear
state feedback controller if we set the homogeneous degree τ = 0. In this step, by
simply modifying the homogeneous degree τ from 0 to several negative values
gradually, we can implement the proposed finite-time controller to obtain a better
control performance while the control gains can be set as fixed values. By under￾standing that in real-life systems, there are various disturbances/uncertainties,
hence it is of significance that the proposed finite-time controller could reduce
the settling time and improve the system robustness against the inevitable dis￾turbances/uncertainties. As depicted by Figures 8.4 and 8.7, the control perfor￾mance is significantly improved if τ is a negative value and moreover, a smaller τ
will clearly lead to a faster convergence speed and lower steady error. Under the
proposed finite-time controller (8.3), it can be observed from Figures 8.5 and 8.8
that the bandwidth factor L has also played a key role as a larger L will lead to an168  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

obvious performance variation as well. However, it should be pointed out here
that a larger L will cause a clear deterioration of the system robustness against
the measurement noises, which is a common problem of the existing high gain
control methods. In Figures 8.6 and 8.9, the control performance variation along
with the control gain selection k1 while the other control parameters are fixed is
depicted. To make the comparisons clearer and more precise, the performance

Table 8.2.
As a direct conclusion from the above illustrated figures, the proposed finite￾time control strategy will clearly lead to a significant control performance im￾provement while the control gain selection guideline is as simple as conventional
linear state feedback controllers. Moreover, the added negative homogeneous
degree will endow the control engineers a much flexibility of tuning the control
performances in practical implementations.
Performance comparison with optimal controller
In order to better demonstrate the control performance superiorities of the
proposed nonsmooth controller with the existing asymptotical controllers, we
present an experimental performance comparison with an optimal controller
by predictive approach [8, 18, 87]. The controller is derived based on optimiz￾Table 8.2 Performance indexes of PD controller, linear state feedback con￾troller, and finite-time controller

The detailed process of derivation can be found in [8]. It is worth noting that

control order r. For simplicity, the control order r is set as 0 and the predictive
period T is set as the only tunable parameter.
Under a set-point tracking control objective, the control performance com￾parisons of the proposed finite-time controller (5.22) and the optimal controller
(8.4) are presented in Figure 8.10. By noting that the initial torque amplitude of
the candidate controllers is placed in a similar level in order to make a fair com￾parison, the robustness exhibited by the proposed finite-time controllers is much
stronger than the optimal controllers. A lower steady state error can be achieved
with the import of a negative homogeneous degree. Similar conclusions can also
be obtained from the case of trajectory tracking as shown in Figure 8.11. To
make the comparison clearer, the detailed performance indexes of both set-point
tracking and trajectory tracking cases are also included in Table 8.3.172  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

Case I: A linear composite control scenario
First, we consider a simple linear control case, that is, by intentionally set￾ting the homogeneous degree as τ = ω = 0 in the control scheme (8.6), the
proposed method reduces to a linear GPI observer based controller (GPIOBC)
[48]. In the experimental test, the gain parameters for the GPIOBC are given
as K = [0.8,0.01,0.2,0.01], L = 1, [`2,1, `2,2, `2,3, `2,4] = [4,6,4,1], [`4,1, `4,2] =

been tuned to achieve their best possible performances, respectively. Besides,
we also present three different values of ki in the PID controller for a better

to the intentionally added feedfoward decoupling loops enabled by the designed

a consistent conclusion can be obtained that better steady state control perfor￾mance under the proposed controller than both PID and FTC controllers, as is
clearly observed in Figures 8.14 and 8.15. Figure 8.16 shows that the proposed
disturbance observer could perform a satisfactory disturbance estimation result,
which enables the feedforward compensation in each channel.
In order to test the performance recovery ability of the control system with
the presence of large external disturbances, an artificial external torque is im￾posed and evacuated to the SEA system around t = 2 s and t = 4.6 s, respec￾tively. The position of the link will inevitably fluctuate, as illustrated by Figure184  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

performance recovery owing to the function of the embedded nonsmooth dis￾turbance observer. This feature enhances the practical nature of the proposed
composite control strategy.Chapter 9
Applications to DC
Microgrid Systems
9.1 Introduction of DC Microgrids
In recent years, both academia and industry take great interest in DC microgrids.
As a kind of small-scale DC power distribution system, it provides a feasible and
effective platform to integrate renewable energy sources (RESs), energy storage
systems (ESSs) and different kinds of loads. Compared with AC microgrids, DC
microgrids behave relatively simple topological structure, less energy conversion
process, etc. Moreover, the regulations of reactive power/frequency are no longer
demanded. Owing to the above advantages, DC microgrids are widely applied in
electric vehicles, more electric aircraft, commercial buildings, rural areas, etc.
Maintaining stable operation of the bus voltage is the basic condition for DC
microgrids. According to a particular DC microgrid, which is shown in Figure
9.1, the stability of its bus voltage is influenced by the power variation of input
and output sides. On the input power side, RESs (e.g., photovoltaic and wind tur￾bines) usually work in maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode to largely
harvest power without participating in the regulation of bus voltage. However,
the output power of RESs always varies with solar irradiance, environment tem￾perature, wind speed, weather conditions, etc. For the output side, the drastic
changes in loads also affect the stability of the system. Besides conventional
resistive loads, it is noted that power electronic converters and motor drives in
advanced automotive systems, when tightly regulated, behave as constant power
loads (CPLs). As reported in [17], they always show negative impedance char￾acteristics at input terminals, which might affect power quality and even lead to

unstable situations. Hence, various active control techniques have been investi￾gated to mitigate the instability problems caused by CPLs. Furthermore, the high
frequency characteristics of the switching power supply will increase the cur￾rent/voltage rate of change and thus lead to electrical interactions. In this regard,
multiple converters (especially DC-DC converters) usually produce adverse cou￾pled interactions at the system level. These undesired interactions may result in
global system instability, load imbalance for parallel converters, noise coupling
and electromagnetic interference. Hence it is widely regarded as a critical issue
to maintain the stability of DC microgrids when facing the inevitable system
uncertainties and disturbances.
In order to handle the mismatched power issue with the presence of continu￾ous variations of all kinds of loads and constant power sources (CPSs), dispatch￾able units (DUs), which usually refer to fuel cells, energy storage, micro-turbine,
etc., are introduced into DC microgrids. By doing so, the mismatched power can
be compensated/absorbed timely and the bus voltage fluctuation can be main￾tained within a proper range. For DC DUs, the realizations of constant voltage
mode (CVM) and droop mode (DM) significantly rely on their properly con￾trolled interfacing converters.
Regarding the stabilization issue for DC microgrids, a variety of studies can
be found in the literature, which mainly falls into two categories: small-signal
analysis (SSA) and large-signal analysis (LSA). On one hand, the principle
of SSA is to calculate and locally linearize the system at the operating point.
Then the stability can be studied via classical linear analysis tools. However,
the small-signal model of the system will lose its accuracy if the operating con￾dition is largely deviated, especially when plug-and-play (PnP) operation, RESApplications to DC Microgrid Systems  187
fluctuations and load variations happen. On the other hand, LSA uses nonlinear
tools, e.g., Lyapunov function based methods, to analyze the global system sta￾bility. It enables the system to resist large external disturbances caused by the re￾connection/disconnection of DUs or the unpredictable variations of local/global
loads.
To avoid unnecessary compromises to model completeness and make LSA
more applicable to the DC MG with amounting complexities, in this chapter,
we propose several new decentralized composite controller design methods to
unify both CVM and DM. Each DU, as well as its interfacing converter, consti￾tutes a subsystem. For easy explanation, RESs are emulated as constant power
sources (CPSs). These CPSs together with resistive loads and CPLs are merged
into the equivalent lumped load which would be fed by DUs. In this context, the
electrical coupling of a particular DU subsystem with other subsystems/loads
is first estimated by a certain disturbance observer, such as higher-order sliding
mode observer (HOSMO), nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO), high gain dis￾turbance observers, etc. Then, instead of directly dealing with the DC MG as a
whole, the DCC is individually designed to counteract the observed coupling and
simultaneously stabilize the internal states of each subsystem in the large-signal
sense. By doing so, each DU subsystem can be decoupled from one another and
operates in an isolated way from the perspectives of control and stability. When
those subsystems are interconnected, the global large-signal stability of the entire
MG can be achieved by simply ensuring the local stabilities of individual sub￾systems. Therefore, this chapter mainly discusses the decentralized based stabi￾lization scheme without any requirement for communication links between DUs,
which remarkably enhances the flexibility and scalability of the DC microgrid.

in CVM, or determined by a droop controller in DM. For the latter, vCir can be
written as,

where V

is the nominal DC bus voltage and mi

9.2.2 Decentralized composite controller design
Comparing (9.1) and (9.4), it is shown that the original nonlinear model of the
boost converter has been converted into a linear one, which substantially facili￾tates the large-signal regulator design. However, the dynamics described in (9.4)
are affected by ςi
that is exactly the additive inverse of the output power. The
presence of ςi may threaten the tracking performance and even impair the sys￾tem stability. On these bases, it is imperative to know the precise value of ςi
and further process it appropriately in the control law. To this end, a disturbance
observer can be constructed as the following form [37]:



˙zˆi11 = zi2 +zˆi12 +li1σi(zi1 −zˆi11),
˙zˆi12 = zˆi13 +li2σ

(zi1 −zˆi11),
˙zˆi13 = li3σ
3
i
(zi1 −zˆi11),
(9.7)
where ˆzi11, ˆzi12, and ˆzi13 are the estimates of zi1, ςi
, and ς˙i1, respectively σi > 1 is a
scaling gain which will be identified later. Hi = col (li1, li2, li3) is an observer gain
vector with its components being corresponding to the coefficients of a Hurwitz
polynomial,
pi(s) = s
3 +li1s
2 +li2s+li3. (9.8)
From a practical point of view, Poi has its physical meaning, and it would not
go to infinity in the real engineering. Therefore, the derivatives of ςi should be
limited in bounded ranges, which can be mathematically delineated below,

Hence, there must exist a symmetrical and positive definite matrix Qi

Next, it will be shown that error dynamics can be stabilized at the origin if

a sufficiently large σi can be selected to satisfy

Then, for any ei ∈ (R

As implied by (9.16), the time derivative of Lyapunov function for errors can
be rigorously negative in the case whenVei > εi
. Moreover, by scrutinizing (9.14),
σi and εi are inversely correlated. When γi keeps unchanged, the increased σi
leads to the decreased εi
. Hence, it is possible to adequately magnify σi so that εi
almost equals zero, which means that Ωεi can be infinitesimal and consequently
ei can be regulated as small as possible. In this sense, based on (9.7), it is rational
to replace ςi
in (9.5) with the estimated value ˆzi12, which can be expressed as
zi1r = 0.5Li(−zˆi12/Ei)
2 +0.5Civ

Cir. (9.17)Applications to DC Microgrid Systems  191
Then, the estimated quantity can now be employed to accomplish the com￾posite controller design. For that, intermediate states should be introduced first.
These states are defined as
ξi1 = zi1 −zi1r
,
ξi2 = (zi2 −zi2r)/βi
,
vi = (ui −uir)/β

i
, (9.18)
where βi > 1 is a positive scaling factor which will be made precisely later on,
vi
is an auxiliary control input, zi1r has been given by (9.17), zi2r and uir are the
reference signals for zi2 and ui
, which are given below:
zi2r = z˙i1r −zˆi12, uir = z¨i1r −zˆi13. (9.19)
It is evident that zi1 and zi2 are equal to their references zi1r and zi2r
in the
case that the intermediate states reduce to zero. Accordingly, the boost converter
output voltage vCi can be forced to track vCir.
For a better understanding this scheme, the time derivatives of ξi1 and ξi2 can
be computed as
˙ξi1 = βiξi2 +σiei2,
˙ξi2 = βivi +li2σ

i

. (9.20)
To stabilize the above dynamics, vi could be designed as the linear combi￾nation of ξi1 and ξi2, i.e., −ki1ξi1 − ki2ξi2 where ki1 and ki2 are positive con￾stants. Then the equivalent decentralized composite controller (DCC) ui can be
expressed as
ui = −β

(ki1ξi1 +ki2ξi2) +uir. (9.21)
9.2.3 Experimental tests
To verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed DCC, an in-house ex￾perimental platform is built up, as displayed in Figure 9.3. The platform consists
of a dSPACE controller, two boost converters, a resistive load and an electronic
load. In this section, the electronic load acting as a CPL is integrated to the DC
bus, and for operating safety, the resistor is also incorporated into the system. It
should be noted that the damping effect devoted by the resistor is minor because
the resistance is purposely tuned to be excessively large, i.e., 1698 Ω. Hence, the
CPL still overwhelmingly dominates the lumped load. Six cases are arranged to
compare the voltage regulation performances of the converters controlled under
the DCC and the PI. Experimental results will show that the former method helps
to stabilize the DC MG and contributes larger operation range than the latter one
in both CVM and DM.192  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

Constant voltage mode test:
This case investigates normal system operations in CVM. The key parame￾ters in the DCC have been provided in Table 9.1. PI parameters (voltage loop:
kp=0.5, ki=15.75; current loop: kp=0.0775, ki=24.35;) are carefully tuned so that
the voltage deviations resulting from load changes are identical to that with the
DCC. Hence, it is fair to conduct necessary comparisons of DCC and PI con￾trollers.
As shown in Figure 9.4, DC bus is rigorously regulated at 170 V at the be￾ginning. When a sudden CPL step-up from 50 W to 350 W is activated, identical
voltage drops (5 V) are observed for both PI controller and DCC. It is conspic￾uous that the DCC is competent to restore the bus voltage to its nominal value
(170 V) within about 9 ms, whereas the voltage recovery time of PI is estimated
as 70 ms. A slight overshoot on the inductor current iL1 is due to the fact that
the DCC makes efforts to transfer more power from the source to the load for

shortening the transient duration. Hence, the load-changing effects on the bus
voltage can be minimized.
It is well-known that a DC system integrated with an invariant CPL and a
resistor may suffer from more serious stability problems when the bus voltage is
lowered. Motivated by this assertion, different from case 1 where MG voltage is
maintained strictly at 170 V, case 2 examines the system stability given that the
voltage reference declines while the CPL maintains at a comparatively high level
(550 W). As shown in Figure 9.5, when vC1r steps down from 170 V to 160 V, the
MG is stable under both DCC and PI controller. However, transient oscillations
of the bus voltage and the inductor current are found in the PI regulated system.
In the situation that vC1r reduces from 170 V to 150 V, as recorded in Figure 9.6,
the system with the PI unfortunately collapses, whereas the DCC stabilizes the
DC bus voltage at the targeted value. Following case 1, case 3 studies the worst
scenario that the CPL abruptly surges from 50 W to 650 W, and experimental
results have been shown in Figure 9.7. For this atrocious case, with the proposed
DCC, although a voltage drop of 10 V occurs at the instant of a load change,

the bus voltage quickly recovers to 170 V in a short time, which means voltage
regulation has been realized. In contrast, the PI controller fails to survive this
huge CPL increase, and the entire MG system is destabilized.
Summarily, the results in cases 2 and 3 experimentally consolidate the the￾oretical analysis that, the DCC can extend the system operating margin and
attain the large-signal stability. By means of the DCC, considerable equilib￾rium changes are permitted by the MG, and thus, operational flexibility can be
markedly raised.
Droop mode test:
Figure 9.8 shows the experimental results with the droop coefficients of two
converters set as 0.01 when the CPL steps up from 100 W to 700 W. In this case,
DU ratings in the MG are assumed to be identical, and they would evenly share
CPL variations. For DCC and PI controller, the same voltage drops of around
7 V are observed when the load increase is triggered. The DC bus reaches a new
level which is 166.5 V. Differences lie on that the DCC spends 9 ms on the bus
voltage transition, whereas the PI controller takes estimated 50 ms. Similar to
case 1, inductor overshoots are found during system transitions by employing
the DCC. these phenomena could be well explained by exigent power transfer

enforced by the DCC from the source to the load. As a result, more rapid sys￾tem dynamics can be acquired. It is important to reiterate that droop controllers
intentionally enlarge the output impedances of the converters, which is a com￾promised solution to sidestep the voltage conflictions of multiple sources. The
increased droop gains may induce more power interactions between CPL and
sources, thus possibly aggravating the MG stability. For this reason, different
from ordinary operations shown by case 4, case 5 would explore the impacts of
droop gain fluctuations on the MG performances.
At first, droop gains are chosen as 0.02 for the two converters. The bus volt￾age fixes at 169 V when the CPL is scheduled as 100 W (see Figure 9.9). When
the CPL rises to 700 W, both DCC and PI controller can stably regulate the bus
voltage at around 163 V. It should be noted that the PI controller causes transient
voltage and current oscillations, while the proposed DCC allows a smoother sys￾tem transition. Continuing to increase the droop gains to 0.04, relevant results
have been shown in Figure 9.10. The PI controller-based MG is unstable under
the CPL step-up, whereas the DCC regulates the bus voltage stabilized at a new

value that is 156 V. For the three scenarios in cases 4 and 5, the two converters are
assigned with identical droop coefficients for easy operations. The consolidated
droop gains are 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02 respectively. When the total droop coeffi￾cient grows, the destabilizing effects on the DUs exerted by CPLs will increase
accordingly. Without loss of generality, it should be noted that the superiorities of
the proposed DCC uncovered by the above comparisons can also be found in the
case that the converter droop gains are differently set. For example, given that m1
and m2 are set as 0.06 and 0.03, the total droop gain is (m1m2)/(m1 +m2) = 0.02,
which is equivalent to the second situation of case 5. In this sense, it can be
inferred that the corresponding results would be similar to that in Figure 9.10.
Subsequent to case 4, in this case, droop gains are maintained invariant as
0.01. The overall system stabilities regulated by both DCC and PI controller are
compared when the CPL brutally grows to 1000 W. As plotted in Figure 9.11,
although voltage drop of 8 V is inspected in the transient state, the DCC stabilizes
the DC bus at 165 V after the CPL step-up is enabled. Unluckily, this cruel load
increase cannot be tolerated under the PI control case, and thus, the whole MG is

cases 5 and 6 again validate that the DCC proposed in this section is a large-signal
regulator. It can weather large system disturbances and ensure stable operations
in a wider range.
9.2.4 Extension to other types of converters
In this subsection, DCC design procedures are applied to buck converters and
buck-boost converters working in CVM. If these DU converters intend to work
in DM, one may simply change the voltage reference generating pattern, while
DCC remain unaffected at all.
As shown in Figure 9.12, the averaged model of a buck converter can be given
as follows:

L˙iL = Ed −vC,
Cv˙C = iL −io, (9.22)
where L, C, iL, io, vC, d, and E are respectively the inductance value, capaci￾tance value, instantaneous inductor current, instantaneous output current, instan￾taneous capacitor voltage, duty cycle, and DC source voltage of the buck con￾verter.
Then, system (9.22) can be transformed by the following coordinate transfor￾mations:
z1 = 0.5Cv2
C,
z2 = vCiL. (9.23)198  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

In (9.25), ς1 and ς2 are the disturbance terms that impact the dynamic states
z1 and z2. Both these disturbances, as elaborated previously, can be regarded as
the electrical couplings of buck converter with other devices. Resembling (9.7),
high gain observers can be designed to estimate the necessary information of ς1
and ς2 respectively.

σ > 1 is a positive scaling gain. col (l11, l12, l13) and col (l21, l22) are observer gain
vectors with their components being the coefficients of Hurwitz polynomials.
Then, the estimated quantities can now be employed to accomplish the com￾posite controller design. To this end, referring to (9.1), intermediate states could
be declared first,
ξ1 = z1 −z1r
,
ξ2 = (z2 −z2r)/β,
v = (u−ur)/β

where β > 1 is a positive scaling gain. v is an auxiliary control input. z1r

and ur

recursively computed from (9.25)–(9.27),

z2r = z˙1r −zˆ12,
ur = z¨1r −zˆ13 −zˆ22, (9.29)Applications to DC Microgrid Systems  199
where vCr is the output voltage reference. Note that in (9.28), buck converter
internal states (z1, z2) and control input u will approximate to the respective ref￾erences if the intermediate states are regulated to zeros. Then the output voltage
control for the buck converter is achieved.
Taking the differentiation of ξ1 and ξ2 leads to the following dynamic equa￾tions:
˙
ξ1 = βξ2 +σe12,
˙
ξ2 = βv+l12σ2
e11/β +σe22/β. (9.30)
To stabilize the above states, a linear state feedback control law that contains
both ξ1 and ξ2 can be designed
v = −k1ξ1 −k2ξ2, (9.31)
where k1 and k2 correspond to the Hurwitz polynomial coefficients. Then the
equivalent controller u could be identified in the following form:
u = −β2
(k1ξ1 +k2ξ2) +ur. (9.32)
As shown in Figure 9.13, the averaged model of a buck-boost converter can
be given as follows:

z1 = 0.5Li2

z2 = EiL. (9.34)

Inspecting (9.36), it now has the identical form to the boost converter canon￾ical model as in (9.4). In this sense, the disturbance observer (9.7) and the com￾posite controller (9.21) can be directly extended to (9.36) without any additional
modifications.
9.3 Finite-Time Performance Recovery and Decentral￾ized Control for DC Microgrids
In this section, we consider a typical multi-source autonomous DC microgrid
as shown in Figure 9.1, where the power electronic interfaces are boost type
converters as they are most widely used in DC microgrid systems. To proceed
with theoretical analysis, we treat the system as a simplified structure including
n-th boost converters linked in a parallel with the DC bus, while the loads are
categorized into a lumped resistive load R and a lumped CPL PCPL.

Up to now, one obvious hurdle appears: how to identify the two lumped terms,
i.e., ∆i,1 and ∆i,2 in order to appoint a precise tracking objective vCir for each
converter. By recalling that a classical double closed-loop PI control would result
in a serious reaction delay and thereafter an adverse effect imposed on transient￾time performance. In this section, we will investigate a novel composite control
strategy by integrating a finite-time feedforward decoupling procedure with a
feedback control loop.
9.3.2 Composite controller construction
Following the proposed control design procedure in the above section, we are
able to obtain a composite decentralized control scheme for each converter of
the DC microgrid system.

9.3.3 Simulation studies
To validate the proposed control strategy, simulation tests are first conducted
in Matlab/Simulink. The classical double closed-loop PI controller is chosen to
compare with the proposed controller so as to manifest the superiorities of the
proposed method. Detailed parameters are provided in Table 9.2. For the sake
of fair comparison, it is noted that the benchmark PI control gain parameters
are well selected according to reference [42] in order to meet an optimal control
performance.
Case 1. Input Voltage Variation Test: In this case, the converter input voltage
is changed to examine the stabilization performance. Two DU subsystems are
involved and their droop coefficients are both set as 0.01. At the beginning, the
bus voltage is regulated at 167.7 V and a 450 W CPL is connected to the DC
bus. As 0.3 s, the converter input voltage of DU1 steps down from 100 V to 80 V
and DU2 remains unchanged. In order to keep the stability of the DC bus, DU1
needs to release more current. As is shown in Figure 9.15, the DU1 controlled
by the proposed approach responses immediately and reaches to its desired value
quickly. Owing to its preeminent transient characteristics, DU2 can be immune
to this sudden change and keeps constant current output. The transient process
of DU1 lasts almost 30ms and thus, the DU2 has to release additional current
to make up the lacking power. The performance on bus voltage in Figure 9.14

also reflects the differences between two candidate controllers. It is not difficult
to find that the recovery capability of bus voltage gets markedly promoted under
the proposed control strategy.
Case 2. CPL Variation Test: The CPL is changed in this case to further ex￾plore the advantages which have been brought by the proposed control method.
The basic setting is identical with the former case. Initially, the bus voltage is sta￾ble at 169 V and a 200 W CPL is connected. Then, the CPL increases to 400 W in
0.25s and decreases to 200 W in 0.45 s. The transient response of bus voltage is
shown in Figure 9.16. With the same load change, obvious voltage overshoot can
be observed under the PI controller. The amplitude of the voltage overshoot goes
down by 2.2 V and the duration of the recovery process is 30 ms. Meanwhile, the
proposed controller demonstrates excellent dynamic performance consistently.
Upon the disturbances happening, the proposed controller can adjust its operat￾ing voltage and reach a steady state in a short period of time. Besides, by further
looking into the current output shown in Figure 9.17, the proposed strategy not
only shows fast dynamic performance as always, but also realizes the accurate
power sharing as we set before.
Case 3. Plug-and-Play Property Test: In what follows, the PnP property is
tested under the proposed controller. DU3 is introduced in this case and its basic
setting is identical with previous DUs. As is shown in Figure 9.18, three DUs are
considered in this test, whose droop coefficients are set as 0.01, 0.02, and 0.015,
respectively. At first, DU1 and DU3 work together to supply 750 W CPL. Mean￾while, DU2 operates independently with 200 W CPL. At 0.2 s, another 250 W
CPL is added into the double DU system and the power of DU1 and DU3 in￾creases to 600 W and 400 W (3:2). In order to take the load off of the DU1 and
DU3, DU2 is connected to the DC bus at 0.3 s. The power is reallocated ac￾cording to their respective droop coefficients, that is 553 W, 369 W, and 278 W
(6:3:4). Subsequently, the 250 W CPL is removed at 0.4s and the output power
of each DU decreases to 438 W, 220 W, 292 W (6:3:4). At 0.5 s, DU3 is discon￾nected. The bus voltage response curve is shown in Figure 9.18(c). The above
tests prove the plug-and-play property of the proposed strategy is well built.
9.3.4 Experimental verification
In what follows, an experimental platform is built to verify the proposed control
strategy in the application of DC microgrids, as shown in Figure 9.3.
To examine the stability of the system, the programmable electronic load
operates in constant power mode to emulate the CPL. In the meantime, the DC
microgrid is operated in the droop mode and the droop coefficients of DU1 and
DU2 are set as 0.01. The parameters of converter components are identical with
Table 9.2 while the gain parameters li, j,0, li, j,1, li, j,2, λi, j
, L, ki,1, ki,2 are redesigned
as 200, 400, 200, 10, 650, 1, 2 for optimal practical control performance. In what
follows, experimental results are provided to verify the proposed control strategy.206  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

load is connected to the DC bus. As shown in Figure 9.19, the converter input
voltage of DU1 steps down from 100 V to 80 V and DU2 remains unchanged.
In order to keep the constant voltage of the DC bus, the current amplitude of208  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

DU1 rises from 2.25 A to 2.8 A in a short period of time. It can be observed that
both candidate controllers could achieve similar performances, which is benefi￾cial from the effort we spent in tuning the parameters for both controllers, aiming
for a fair control performance comparison in the subsequent cases.
Second, only CPL is connected to the DC bus in order to test the micro￾grid system stability under different variation conditions of the CPL. Figure 9.20
shows the experimental results when the CPL steps up from 50 W to 650 W. It
demonstrates that in this case, the PI controller can also achieve the control ob￾jective and maintain system stability. Thereafter, to compare the stability margin
and outstand the advantages of the proposed controller, as shown in Figure 9.21,
a larger CPL variation case is conducted when the CPL suddenly changes from
50 W to 1100 W. Although the voltage has a slight drop, the proposed controller
is able to maintain the stability of the DC bus at 154.5 V eventually. With regard
to the PI controller under the same control parameters setup as in the former
cases, it is conspicuous that large oscillation occurs and increases until the sys￾tem collapses. Consequently, it is confident to reach that the proposed controller
is able to stabilize the system toward a large-signal stability, and therefore pro￾vides a wider operating range for DC microgrid system.

9.4 Decentralized Adaptive Controller Design
As is well acknowledged that most of the existing robust control approaches are
worst case based design and they aim to design controllers with fixed gain pa￾rameters to cope with all possible situations. However, the robustness is obtained
at the price of sacrificing the nominal control performance. During real-life op￾erations, DC microgrids may operate around the nominal working conditions in
most of the operating time and operate in some extreme conditions occasionally.
Designing control parameters with too much worst-case thinking may lead to a
degraded dynamic performance in most of the operation conditions. To be spe￾cific, although strong robustness can ensure system stability when large-signal
disturbances happen, the consequent voltage/current overshoots and even oscil￾lations adverse to smooth operation of DC microgrids are normally observed in
small-signal disturbance cases.
In this section, a novel decentralized adaptive control law is proposed to
achieve a balance between system robustness and adaptivity. Specifically, by
employing an online scaling gain update mechanism which is subject to the real￾time working conditions, both the large-signal stability and desirable nominal
performance can be promised.
9.4.1 Pre-treatment and system modeling
According to the philosophy of disturbance observer-based control, system dis￾turbances and uncertainties are packaged together, and then, the lumped distur￾bances are estimated by an observation mechanism [9]. This thought can also be
applied to the modeling process of DC microgrids. Besides, from the perspective
of power flow, RESs can be emulated as constant power sources (CPSs). In our
methodology, resistive loads, CPLs and CPSs power are classified as a lumped
unknown term

by each subsystem, PRLs and PCPLs are the power consumed by the resistive loads
(RLs) and CPLs, PCPSs is the power of CPSs. Equivalent diagram is detailed in
Figure 9.22.
This section is meant to propose a universal control scheme for both single
DU subsystem and multiple DU subsystems. By following a similar modeling
process in (9.41), the following relationship can be obtained:

χ˙i,1 = χi,2 +ψi,1,

where ui = E2

Li (1− µi), ψi,1 = −Poi, ψi,2 represents parameter uncertain￾ties, unmodeled dynamics, and external disturbances, respectively.

objective of µi is enable χi,1 track its reference value χi,1r, which is expressed as

where V∗ and mi represent the nominal DC bus voltage and the droop coefficient
of the ith DU subsystem.
Remark 9.1 It is worthy of pointing out that the proposed controller can switch
between constant voltage mode and droop mode by modifying the droop coefficient
mi. The descriptions of the above two modes will be discussed in details in the later
section. The proposed controller can also be applied to buck converter, buck-boost
converter, and AC/DC rectifier with some modifications on particular coordinate
transformations as depicted in the previous section. Besides, the nonlinear modelsApplications to DC Microgrid Systems  211
of CPLs and CPSs could be linearized at a given operating point (I = P/V). Then,
the obtained equivalent circuit models of RLs, CPLs, and CPSs can incorporate into
the averaged model of the DC/DC boost converter.
9.4.2 Decentralized adaptive controller design
In what follows, the detailed design procedure of the proposed decentralized
adaptive controller is presented along with rigorous system stability analysis.
In order to facilitate the practical applications, a schematic diagram of the
proposed adaptive approach that includes both power stage and control stage is
provided in Figure 9.23.
As previously discussed, both ψi,1 and ψi,2 have their actual implications in
practical systems, but these values cannot be measured directly by measurement
devices. To achieve this aim, the higher-order sliding mode observation technol￾ogy provides a soft measurement technique to estimate the lumped uncertainties.
Considering the practical physical characteristics of DC microgrids, a rea￾sonable assumption condition can be given: the unknown disturbances ψi,1, ψi,2,
and their (4-j)th-order derivatives are bounded, where j=1, 2, 3.
By referring to the HOSM design in Chapter 5, two finite-time disturbance
observers are constructed as the following form:

In what follows, we mainly consider two typical bus voltage control modes:
CVM and DM. The CVM is preferred when a single DU has enough capacity
to cope with all possible load changes. However, under the circumstance of co￾ordinated operation of multiple DUs, DM can be employed to realize the power
allocation by regulating corresponding droop coefficient mi, which is depicted in
(9.49). Just as its name implies, the reference voltage in droop mode fluctuates as
the load changes. To be specific, heavier loads comes with larger drop and vice
versa.
In order to present the actual control effects, the parameters of simulations
and experiments remain consistent. The detailed system parameters for DC mi￾crogrid system and proposed adaptive controller are summarized in Table 9.3.
In simulation studies, a DC microgrid operated in CVM, which is shown in
Figure 9.25, is considered to verify the proposed control strategy.
Simulation Case 1. Constant power load tests: The variation of CPLs is con￾sidered in this test. A robust backstepping controller in [69] is chosen to com￾pare with the proposed controller. As shown in Figure 9.26, the systems sepa￾rately controlled by the two controllers are running steadily and the voltage is
precisely stabilized at 160 V. In 0.4 s, CPLs vary from 100 W to 300 W. The pro￾posed controller reacts immediately once the loads are increased. More currents
are released to compensate the required power and the bus voltage can return toApplications to DC Microgrid Systems  215

founded in the system controlled by the robust backstepping controller due to the
worst-case-based design in the robust control, which leads to the degraded nomi￾nal performance of controlled system. The well observation effect of the HOSM
observer and the response curve of adaptive gain L are also plotted in Figure
9.26. It is worth noting that the initial value of the adaptive gain L is set to 1 and
it could make real-time adjustments according to the condition of operation.
Remark 9.2 It should be noted that due to the ideal environment of simulation

Simulation Case 2. Renewable energy source tests: As shown in Figure 9.27,
the intermittency of RESs is considered to further validate the effectiveness of
the proposed controller. In this test, both the CPL and RES are connected to the
DC bus. The power of CPL is set as 200 W and the power of RES changes ev￾ery 0.1 s. With the variation of RES power, the DU subsystem can make timely
adjustments to its inductor current and the bus voltage can be regulated at the
nominal value within a short time. The HOSM observer can accurately estimate
the lumped power of CPL and RES. The simulation results in Figure 9.27 demon￾strate the proposed control strategy can cope well with the frequent power changeApplications to DC Microgrid Systems  217

is validated.
9.4.4 Experimental tests
In order to verify the proposed control strategy, a scale-down DC microgrid is
built in the laboratory, which is shown in Figure 9.3. The designed control al￾gorithm is embedded in dSPACE 1202 to generate PWM signals to the DC/DC
converters with a switching frequency of 10 kHz.
In addition, the classical PI controller is chosen to compare with the proposed
method. For a relatively fair comparison, the parameters of the PI controller are
not obtained by those “trial and error” methods. They are carefully tuned by the218  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
standard design guideline recommended by [42] and finally determined as (kpv,
kiv, kpc, kic)=(0.3, 0.15, 0.275, 0.275).
In this test, both CVM and DM are considered and the performance of the
two candidate controllers will be examined by different degrees of disturbances.
Experimental case 1. Constant voltage mode tests: In the first case, both of
the two controllers work in the CVM and only one DU system operates. As
shown in Figure 9.28, the bus voltage of the DU system stabilizes at 160 V and
the power of CPL is 50 W. When the CPL increases to 200 W, different dynamic
performances can be observed. According to the DU subsystem controlled by
the PI controller, a slight voltage drop happens and it takes about 3 s to reach its
reference value. And the similar performance occurs with the inductor current.
Different from the former one, although a certain amount of voltage drop can be
noticed, both the bus voltage and inductor current only take 0.5 s to reach their
corresponding steady values.
Similar experimental results can also be found in Figures 9.29 and 9.30.
Through the above results, we can find that although obvious voltage drop and
current overshoot can be observed, the proposed controller has a rapid dynamic
response speed and that sort of validates our algorithm.
Remark 9.3 From the experimental results in the first case, we can find that the
two candidate controller exhibit different dynamic performances and the PI controller
seems to perform better from the general point of view. This distinct contrast indi￾cates that the parameters for PI controller are well selected to deal with the small￾signal disturbances. The variation rate of L is limited, which is summarized in Table
9.4. Hence the proposed controller does not have enough energy to enable the actual
voltage to track its reference value in a short time. In the next case, the decentralized
cooperate control is adopted and the large-signal disturbances are tested to conduct
a further comparison between the two controllers.
Experimental Case 2. Droop mode tests: In the second case, the DM is em￾ployed in order to realize the power allocation among the two DU subsystems.

Figure 9.29 Experimental results in constant voltage mode with CPL changes

The droop coefficients of DU1 and DU2 are both set at 0.1 and hence the load
power can be equally allocated. Figure 9.31 shows the dynamic performance of
the two controllers in DM when CPL changes from 50 W to 200 W. Different
from the constant voltage case, the proposed controller exhibits better perfor￾mances than the PI controller whether in voltage or current.
Proceed to Figures 9.32 and 9.33 in which the CPL is increased to 400 W
and 800 W respectively. Slow voltage response and obvious voltage drop can be
noticed in the DC system controlled by the PI controller. Turning to another one,
the system controlled by the proposed controller can quickly adjust its voltage
to the desired value and meanwhile, the inductor current also responses immedi￾ately. It attributes to timely dynamic changes of Li and large-signal disturbances
can accelerate and intensify its rate of changes.
In order to further test the dynamic performance and the system stability,
the CPL is changed from 50 W to 1000 W in the last case. As can be observed
from Figure 9.34, the system controlled by the PI controller appears to man￾ifest voltage and current oscillations and which eventually causes the system
to crash. In contrast, under the circumstance of large-signal disturbance, the
proposed controller can online adjust its adaptive gains and eventually deter￾mine at 53.32 and 53.09. Although a slight current overshoot can be observed,

9.5 Nonsmooth Control Design for Multi-Bus DC
Microgrids
A representative multi-bus DC MG has been plotted in Figure 9.35. For a certain
bus, DGs will contribute to regulating the bus voltage and limit the voltage within
an allowable range. RESs like PVs and wind turbines are normally working max￾imum power point tracking modes. Resistive loads (RLs) and CPLs would absorb
powers from their feeding buses. Noting that all RESs, resistive loads and CPLs
are not participating in the bus regulation, the stability of DC voltage will ulti￾mately count on those distributed generators (DGs). In Figure 9.35, the lumped
load Pil of the ith bus is defined as
Pil = PiLoads −PiRESs = PiRLs +PiCPLs −PiRESs, i = 1,2,3,4. (9.55)
Concerning DGs, three commonly used DC/DC converters (boost, buck,
buck-boost) have been shown in Figure 9.36. For all that they are initially de￾vised for different voltage levels, without loss of generality, all three converter
topologies are considered here as they will more than likely appear in a generic
DC architecture. To standardize the design process of the stabilizer, regardless of222  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

model differences, proper coordinate transformations will be performed on the
converters in Figure 9.36. Hence, they can eventually be expressed in a uniform
dynamic form. For the boost type converter, its average model in a switching
period can be written as

iL = E/L−(1−d)vC/L, L = L0 +∆L,
v˙C = (1−d)iL/C −Po/(CvC), C = C0 +∆C
(9.56)
where L0 and C0 stand for the nominal inductance and nominal capacitance, re￾spectively. ∆L and ∆C denote parameter uncertainties. E,iL,vC, and Po are input
voltage, inductor current, capacitor voltage, and output power, respectively. d is
the duty cycle. Then writing (9.56) into the one with respect to L0, C0, ∆L, and
∆C yields,

It is obvious that the transformed equations of boost, buck, and buck-boost
converters have the same mathematical expressions, as in (9.59), (9.63), and
(9.67). These uniform converter modeling approaches make it easier to develop a
decentralized composite stabilizer that uniformly applies disregarding converter
model discrepancies. The stabilizer will be minutely elaborated in the next sec￾tion.
9.5.1 Controller design
The previous section has explicated that the three converter topologies could
be unexceptionally represented by a uniform dynamic form. In a generic multi￾bus DC MG, a boost converter could appear at any DC bus, and so do its peer
converters (buck and buck-boost). For easy explanations, uniform dynamics in
(9.59), (9.63), and (9.67) are assigned with subscript “i j” and retrofitted as,
x˙i j1 = xi j2 +ϑi j1,
x˙i j2 = ui j +ϑi j2, (9.68)
where “i j” indicates that the associated state variables are in the jth converter
at the ith DC bus. Although the control input ui j and xi j1 are in the linear rela￾tion, the dual-integrator system is unfortunately coupled with ϑi j1 and ϑi j2 which
are imposed by other DGs, the impedance network and parameter uncertainties,
etc. The presence of ϑi j1 and ϑi j2 may adversely affect the reference tracking
performances and even cause instabilities to DGs. It is hence essential to know
the exact disturbances and eliminate them in the controller. To this end, a de￾centralized nonsmooth disturbance observer is constructed in (9.69) for fast and
precise ϑi j1 estimation. The observer for ϑi j2 can be derived from (9.69) with
slight modifications as the two equations in (9.68) share the same format.

Observers (9.69) and (9.71) have estimated the disturbances in the DG uni￾form representation given by (9.68). These disturbances should now be neutral￾ized by a nonsmooth feedback controller which simultaneously ensures the local
DG large signal stability and achieves the desired reference tracking. For this pur￾pose, intermediate states in relation to xi j1, xi j2 could be defined of the following

For the DGs based on boost, buck, and buck-boost converters, their volt￾age references could be from droop controllers for realizing power sharing, or
the references are directly consigned with constants to minimize output voltage
deviations. In the multi-bus MG in Figure 9.35, constant voltages at all buses
would cause no power flow on the impedance network. Then linking cables in
DC buses can be equivalently removed while not affecting individual bus regu￾lations, which violates the initial intention of establishing a multi-bus MG. As
such, it is preferable to configure all DGs in droop patterns and the power in￾teractions among buses would thus be possible. Once the voltage reference vCrApplications to DC Microgrid Systems  227
for a DG is correctly determined, the reference signal xi j1r for the transformed
uniform system (9.68) can be accordingly computed referring to (9.58), (9.62),

By the composition of the nonsmooth disturbance observer and the nons￾mooth composite control, disturbances in the uniform expression (9.68) can be
fully neutralized. Besides, the proposed controller does allow decentralized sta￾bilizer deployment into individual DGs among which no communication is in￾curred, but large signal stability of the entire multi-bus MG is achieved. This
novel stabilizing concept categorically strengthens the MG PnP functionality, re￾liability, and scalability.
9.5.2 Discussions
1) Justification of using multi-bus DC system
On the one hand, in rural areas and wild battlefields, it has remote change
to introduce AC power from urban generation stations, but a possible choice
is to build up islanded DC MGs to incorporate sources and loads together, for
the reduction of energy conversion stages, to achieve better system management
[47]. When it comes to multiple DC MGs, as suggested by [66], MG buses could
be interconnected by tie lines such that the DC systems can provide support to
each other and enhance overall DC system operational reliability228  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
On the other hand, for a given MG, it is not always feasible to maintain
only a single DC bus. Electrical devices are coupled together to form a com￾plete DC system through cable lines which indisputably have their own line
impedances. Although many existing results simply assume that all DGs are col￾lectively linked to a certain bus. The scenario that makes more general sense is to
allow the DG output terminals to be interlinked via the line impedance network
of arbitrary topology. These DGs together with their loads establish local DC
buses, and therefore, there would exist multiple DC buses in the MG. On these
bases, the topology in Figure 9.35 is capable of representing the two multi-bus
concepts discussed above. For either a DC system with multiple MGs or a multi￾bus DC MG, they unexceptionally arouse wide academic attention and do make
practical sense in real applications.
2) Grid connected operations
DC MG can be coupled to the utility grid through a three-phase AC/DC in￾verter which can be controlled under power-regulated mode. In this sense, the
inverter, an interface to the utility, actually serves as a constant power source
(CPS) or a constant power load (CPL) provided that the power command for the
inverter is invariant. Specifically, if the inverter detects that the average value of
multiple bus voltages exceeds the preset threshold, which indicates the multi￾bus DC system is lightly loaded, then the grid-connected inverter will transfer
power from the MG to the grid, such that the bus voltages would be regulated
within allowable ranges. Inversely, if it is perceived that the DC MG is heavily
loaded, then the inverter will extract power from the grid and inject it into the
MG system.
9.5.3 Simulation studies
The results presented above have shown how to formulate decentralized com￾posite stabilizers for individual DGs. To make the stabilizer easier to implement
by engineering practitioners, key parameter selection guidance for observers in
(9.69), (9.71) and controller in (9.72), (9.73) will be provided in this subsection.
The impacts of fine-tuning factor τ on converter dynamics will also be illustrated.
Note that DG converter models can be expressed as a uniform model in
(9.68). Without loss of generality and for clear explanations, a boost type con￾verter with its output voltage always regulated at 170 V is used to demonstrate
the parameter selection procedures. The selecting results can be directly used in
buck and buck-boost converters without further changes because all three types
of converters in Figure 9.36 share the same dynamic model under the proposed
UNCS. Overviewing the structure of composite stabilizer, the observer would
convey necessary estimations to the controller.
Thus, it is preferred that the observer dynamics are much faster than the con￾troller. Taking the observer expressed in (9.69) as an example, a Hurwitz poly￾nomial, which indicates all its roots are in the left-half plane, can be selectedApplications to DC Microgrid Systems  229
as h(s)=(s+1)3 = s3 +3s2 +3s+1. Then li j11,li j12, and li j13 in (9.69) can be
accordingly identified as 3, 3, and 1. Similarly, in observer (9.71), a second or￾der polynomial with repeated roots of 1 could be formulated, h(s)=(s+1)2 =
s2 +2s+1. By coefficients matching, li j21 and li j22 are respectively assigned as
2 and 1, and ki j1 and ki j2 in the controller (9.73) can also be designed as 1 and 2,
respectively.
Figure 9.37 shows the dynamics of ˆxi j12 in observer (9.69) with various σi j1
when CPL changes from 200 W to 400 W, βi j is differently set and τ is tem￾porarily given as −0.02. From Figure 9.37(a), the transient duration of ˆxi j12 are
around 0.017s, 0.009s, 0.005s, 0.003s, and 0.002s with σi j1 varying from 500
to 2500 in step of 500. The smaller σi j1 helps to increase the observer dynamic
response. Comparing Figure 9.37(a) and Figure 9.37(b) further suggests that the
βi j variation in the controller hardly affects the observer transient performances.
Since the observer described by (9.71) has the similar form to (9.69), the param￾eter σi j2 can be set the same as σi j1. Afterward, it is possible to fix σi j1 and σi j2
and scrutinize controller dynamics along with the changes of βi j, as illustrated
in Figure 9.38. All the converging speeds of converter output voltage, internal
states xi j1 and xi j2 are improved by the increase of βi j. For example, in Figure
9.38(a), in the case of CPL step-up, the settling times of the voltage can be read

as 0.02 s, 0.015 s, 0.011 s, 0.01 s, and 0.009 s respectively, when βi j is designed
as 400, 650, 900, 1150, and 1400. In this simulation, σi j1,σi j2, and βi j are re￾spectively selected as 2000, 2000, and 650 such that the observer could respond
over 5 times faster than the controller. This set of parameters is subsequently
used to demonstrate how the fine-tuning factor τ refines the composite stabilizer
dynamics, and the parameters will be straightly utilized by experimental tests.
It is clear that the highest dynamic order appears in either the observer or
the controller is 3, and according to the aforesaid homogeneity theory, τ can
only vary in the range (−1
3 ,0). On this point, transient performances of ˆxi j12,
output voltage, states xi j1 and xi j2 subjected to τ variations are all displayed in
Figure 9.39. The figure explicitly illustrates that τ provides an extra control de￾gree of freedom additional to σi j1,σi j2, and βi j, but not impairing the large signalApplications to DC Microgrid Systems  231

stability. A lowered τ brings about better dynamic responses, i.e., less under￾shoots and shorter transient durations. In this section, τ is chosen as the smallest
one (−0.28), so as to make full use of refining functionality endowed by the
fine-tuning factor.
9.5.4 Experimental tests
A representative multi-bus DC MG for experiments is plotted in Figure 9.40.
A boost converter, a buck converter, and a buck-boost converter are DGs sep￾arately distributed at three buses for voltage regulations. The PWM signals are
generated from dSPACE 1006. Line impedances of dissimilar values interlink
the three buses to constitute a multi-bus system as intended. Each bus is loaded
by a programmable electronic load. All DGs are under droop modes, with the
droop controllers written as
VCri = Vn −miPoi, i = 1,2,3, (9.78)
where VCri denotes the voltage reference for the i-th DG. Poi is the output power
and mi is droop coefficient. More details of the hardware system have been sum￾marized in Table 9.5.
A. Plug and Play Test
For the configuration in Figure 9.40, the voltages at three DC buses equal
vC1, vC2, and vC3 respectively. All electronic loads in this PnP test are configured232  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
Figure 9.40 Hardware experimental platform of a representative multi-bus DC
MG.
as CPLs, and the experimental results are recorded in Figure 9.41. At the be￾ginning, the CPLs of DG1, DG2, and DG3 are separately scheduled as 300 W,
400 W, and 500 W. As seen in Figure 9.41(a), before DG2 plugs in, the output
powers of DGs are 300, 400 W, and 500 W. The DC bus voltages can be esti￾mated as 167 V, 166 V, and 165 V. At this stage, vC1 is the highest since DG1 has
the lightest load. Its output voltage deviation from the nominal value (Vn) would
be less than other DGs due to the existence of droop controller. When DG2 is
connected to DG1 via line impedance (0.5 Ω, 0.25 mH), DG1 takes up a part of
the load of DG2; hence the power of DG2 decreases by around 44.3 W. In Figure
9.41(b), DG3 is further plugged into the system to form a complete three-bus
MG. The three DGs will simultaneously share all the loads across the MG. The
DG powers can thus be read as 386.4 W, 393.5 W, and 420.3 W. This means DG1

and DG2 help to alleviate the loading stresses of DG3 as its output power sig￾nificantly decreases while the power supplied by DG1 and DG2 increases. From
the testing results, it is safe to conclude that the proposed composite stabilizer in
UNCS does allow PnP functions, which certainly enhance the operational flexi￾bility of multi-bus MGs.
B. Stability Comparison By using the proposed composite stabilizer, it is true
that large-signal stabilization has been achieved. It is now ready to experimen￾tally justify that the proposed UNCS is superior to the conventional PI control
schemes which are also accomplished in a decentralized way. According to stan￾dard design of double PI loops given in [2], the parameters for the boost, buck,
and buck-boost based DGs are tabularized in Table 9.6. For either voltage loops234  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

or current loops, the stability margins are uniformly designed as 84.29◦ which is
supposed to be sufficient for handling possible worse scenarios.
To compare stabilization capability between the UNCS and PI control, dif￾fering from the preceding PnP tests, electronic loads are all programmed as pure
CPLs to emulate the worst operating condition. Figure 9.42 shows the experi￾mental outcomes with three CPLs concurrently stepping up from 100 W to 700 W
by 100 W. At each step, the multiple DC buses and the DG output powers are
stable. However, for the PI regulated MG, although PI parameters are obtained
following the standard design criteria in [2], as in Figure 9.43(a)–(b), the en￾tire MG is unfortunately destabilized when CPLs simultaneously grow to 600 W.
These observations can be supported by eigenvalue analysis in Figure 9.43(c)
where dominant eigenvalues traverse into the right half plan when CPLs are
600 W. From the above comparisons, it could be discerned that the decentralized
composite stabilizer withstands a wider operating range than PI control does.
Moreover, the proposed stabilizers are in DGs without communication, which
substantially strengthens the MG scalability. Theoretically, as long as MG oper￾ation is within its nominal rating, the multi-bus system can be functioning at any
desired equilibrium, which markedly characterizes the large signal stabilization
of UNCS.
Figure 9.44 shows the experimental results in the situation that all resistances
in line impedances are reduced to 0.5 Ω and MG is with UNCS. This maneuver
will mitigate the stabilizing effects of passive components. In the final stage, it
is clear that all CPLs climb to 800 W and the entire CPL power is 800 × 3 =
2400 W. The DC MG is consistently stable, which attests to the effectiveness of
the proposed UNCS method.

Microgrids
In the above sections, composite controllers applied into DC microgrids inte￾grating disturbance observation with output regulation are explicitly shown. TheApplications to DC Microgrid Systems  235

distinguishing feature can be summarized as the fixed high gain design in a non￾recursive manner. Therefore, a phenomenon can be observed in engineering ex￾periments to DC-DC boost converter that the fixed high gain design can indeed
stabilize the bus voltage, however, with the wide range of fluctuations of con￾stant power loads (CPLs), the transient-time performance, i.e., overshoot value,
tends to be influenced by the fixed value of scaling gain. Moreover, the settling
time varies significantly between large-signal and small-signal disturbances, with
longer settling time for large-signal disturbances which may probably not be a
satisfactory result. In this section, we set the control mode for DC microgrids as236  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications

the constant voltage mode, a novel nonsmooth adaptive controller design strategy
is proposed, aiming to further improve the control performance while the con￾trol system could include a homogeneous degree to exquisitely tune the control
performances.238  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
9.6.1 Controller design
Without loss of generality, we are able to simplify the bus stabilization issue for
the DC microgrid to a constant voltage regulation problem for a DC-DC boost
converter. By following the standardized modeling process in Subsection 9.2.1,
one could straightforwardly arrive at the transformed equivalent system of the
following form:

9.6.2 Experimental tests
The experimental setup is depicted in Figure 9.3. The proposed algorithm is em￾bedded in dSPACE to generate PWM signals for DC-DC boost converter with
a switching frequency of 20 kHz. The analog working condition switching is
achieved by switching the power of the Chroma DC electrical load in the CPL
mode. The involved parameters are listed in Table 9.7.
The experimental design is described as follows: first, the classical PI con￾troller, the nonsmooth composite controllers with fixed and self-tuning scaling
gain are chosen respectively for control performance comparison. Second, the
working conditions are mainly divided into two scenarios: CPL variation changes
from 40 W to 200 W and from 40 W to 400 W that correspond to small-signal and
large-signal stability comparisons. Third, in order to better demonstrate the up￾dating discipline of self-tuning scaling gain, the CPL variation is also carried out
from 40 W to 100 W to 200 W to 300 W and to 400 W, respectivelyApplications to DC Microgrid Systems  239

In this experimental verification, we set a fixed ` as 950.
Scenario 1: CPL varies from 40 W to 200W.
In this scenario, the results of conducted experiments can be seen in Figure
9.45 (a), in which one can observe that for similar voltage deviation, the longest
settling time occurs in the PI controlled system (0.063 s). The control system
behaves as smoother steady-state performance under the controller proposed in
this section than the nonsmooth robust controller, and the dynamic scaling gain
`(t) will converge from 1 to 604.84 to 608.12 with working condition switch￾ing, which implies that the value of ` as 608.12 tends to be more suitable for the
current working condition. In other words, the fixed scaling gain has to be set
as a sufficiently large value aiming to maintain the stability of the bus voltage
with the presence of operating condition switching. Conversely, if the gain se￾lection is over-conservative, the possible robustness redundancy may deteriorate
the steady-state performance to a certain extent.
Scenario 2: CPL varies from 40 W to 400W.
Figure 9.45 (b) presents the detailed results. Obviously, compared with Sce￾nario 1, the transient-time performance of all types of methods has deteriorated
under large-signal switching. However, the overall trends are still consistent with
the transient-time performance under small-signal case, i.e., the settling time of
the PI controller is obviously longer than the nonsmooth controllers, and the
steady-state performance of the nonsmooth robust controller has a slight voltage
oscillation.240  Nonrecursive Control Design for Nonlinear Systems: Theory and Applications
