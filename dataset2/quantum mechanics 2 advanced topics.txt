Index 411Preface
Quantum mechanics is the study of the behaviour of matter and energy at the molecular,
atomic, nuclear levels and even at sub-nuclear level. This book is intended to provide a
broad introduction to fundamental and advanced topics of quantum mechanics. Volume I
is devoted to basic concepts, mathematical formalism and application to physically impor￾tant systems. Volume II covers most of the advanced topics of current research interest in
quantum mechanics. Both the volumes are primarily developed as texts at the graduate
level and also as reference books. In addition to worked-out examples, numerous collection
of exercises are included at the end of each chapter. Solutions are available to confirmed
instructors upon request to the publisher. Some of the exercises serve as a mode of under￾standing and highlighting the significances of basic concepts while others form application
of theory to various physically important systems/problems. Developments made in recent
years on various mathematical treatments, theoretical methods, their applications and ex￾perimental observations are pointed out wherever necessary and possible and moreover they
are quoted with references so that readers can refer them for more details.
Volume I consists of 23 chapters and 7 appendices. Chapter 1 summarizes the needs for
the quantum theory and its early development (old quantum theory). Chapters 2 and 3 pro￾vide the basic mathematical framework of quantum mechanics. Schr¨odinger wave mechanics
and operator formalism are introduced in these chapters. Chapters 4 and 5 are concerned
with the analytical solutions of bound states and scattering states, respectively, of certain
physically important microscopic systems. The basics of matrix mechanics, Dirac’s notation
of state vectors and Hilbert space are elucidated in chapter 6. The next chapter gives the
Schr¨odinger, Heisenberg and interaction pictures of time evolution of quantum mechanical
systems. Description of time evolution of ensembles by means of density matrix is also de￾scribed. Chapter 8 is concerned with Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. A brief account of
wave function in momentum space and wave packet dynamics are presented in chapters 9
and 10, respectively. Theory of angular momentum is covered in chapter 11. Chapter 12 is
devoted exclusively to the theory of hydrogen atom.
Chapters 13 through 16 are mainly concerned with approximation methods such as
time-independent and time-dependent perturbation theories, WKB method and variational
method. The elementary theory of elastic scattering is presented in chapter 17. Identical
particles are treated in chapter 18. The next chapter presents quantum theory of relativistic
particles with specific emphasize on Klein–Gordon equation, Dirac equation and its solution
for a free particle, a particle in a box (Klein paradox) and hydrogen atom.
Quantum mechanics has novel concepts like wave-particle duality, the uncertainty princi￾ple and wave function collapse due to measurement done. Chapter 20 examines the strange
consequences of role of measurement through the paradoxes of EPR and a thought ex￾periment of Schr¨odinger. A brief sketch of Bell’s inequality and the quantum mechanical
examples violating it are given. With reference to wave-particle duality modified double slit
experiments, referred as delayed-choice experiments, have been proposed and performed to
identify whether a microscopic particle decides to behave as a particle or wave at the slits
itself irrespective of the later path. These experiments and their outcomes are presented
in chapter 21. The next chapter introduces and covers the various features of fractional
xiiixiv Preface
quantum mechanics where in the Schr¨odinger equation the space derivative or the time
derivative or both can be fractional.
Considering the rapid growth of numerical techniques in solving physical problems and
significances of simulation studies in describing complex phenomena, the final chapter is
devoted for a detailed description of numerical computation of bound state eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions, transmission and reflection probabilities of scattering potentials, transition
probabilities of quantum systems in the presence of external fields and electronic distribution
of atoms. Some supplementary and background materials are presented in the appendices.
The pedagogic features of volume I of the book, which are not usually found in textbooks
at this level, are the presentation of bound state solutions of Morse oscillator, quantum pen￾dulum, P¨oschl–Teller potential, damped and forced linear harmonic oscillator, solutions of
classical counter part of quantum mechanical systems considered, criterion for bound state,
scattering from a locally periodic potential and reflectionless potential, modified Heisenberg
relation, quaternionic quantum mechanics, wave packet revival and its dynamics, hydrogen
atom in D-dimension, alternate perturbation theories, an asymptotic method for slowly
varying potentials, Klein paradox, EPR paradox, Bell’s theorem, delayed-choice experi￾ments, fractional quantum mechanics and numerical methods for quantum systems.
The volume II consists of 16 chapters. Chapter 1 describes the basic ideas of both clas￾sical and quantum field theories. Quantization of nonrelativistic equation, electromagnetic
field, Klein–Gordon equation and Dirac field is given. The formulation of quantum mechan￾ics in terms of path integrals is presented in chapter 2. Application of it to free particle
and undamped and damped linear harmonic oscillators are considered. In chapter 3 some
illustrations and interpretation of supersymmetric potentials and partners are presented.
A simple general procedure to construct all the supersymmetric partners of a given quan￾tum mechanical systems with bound states is described. The method is then applied to a
few interesting system. A method to generate complex potentials with real eigenvalues is
presented. The next chapter is concerned with coherent and squeezed states. Construction
of these states and their characteristic properties are enumerated. Chapter 5 is devoted
to Berry’s phase, Aharonov–Bohm and Sagnac effects. Their origin, properties, effects and
experimental demonstration are presented. The features of Wigner distribution function are
elucidated in chapter 6.
In composite quantum systems, entanglement is a kind of correlation between subsys￾tems with no classical counterpart. The definition, detection, classification, quantification
and the application of quantum entanglement are covered in chapter 7. The next chapter
discusses the concept of quantum decoherence, its models, experimental studies on it and
its significance in the interpretation of quantum mechanics. There is a growing interest
on quantum computing. Basic aspects of quantum computing are presented in chapter 9.
Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm of finding whether a function is constant or not, Grover’s search
algorithm and Shor’s efficient quantum algorithm for integer factorization and evaluation of
discrete logarithms are described. Chapter 10 deals with quantum cryptography. Basic prin￾ciples of classical cryptography and quantum cryptography and features of a few quantum
cryptographic systems are discussed.
Chapter 11 presents no-cloning theorem concerned with the impossibility of copying a
quantum state without destroying the original state and the features of quantum cloning
machines. Learning the state of a quantum system by appropriate measurements is known
as quantum tomography. An overview of the relevant theory and techniques of quantum
tomography is provided in chapter 12. Simulating or emulating less controllable quantum
systems through some controllable quantum systems is the aim of quantum simulation.
Chapter 13 is devoted to the theoretical and experimental aspects of quantum simulation.
The next chapter is concerned with quantum error correction (QEC), which is foundational
in quantum computing and quantum information processing due to the presence of noisePreface xv
and interaction of the systems with the environment and the measurement devices. Basic
ideas of QEC, setting and using of QEC codes and practical issues in the implementation
of QEC codes are covered.
A brief introduction to other advanced topics such as quantum gravity, quantum cosmol￾ogy, quantum Zeno effect, quantum teleportation, quantum games, quantum diffusion and
quantum chaos is presented in chapter 15. The last chapter gives features of some of the re￾cent technological applications of quantum mechanics. Particularly, promising applications
of quantum mechanics in ghost imaging, detection of weak amplitude objects and small
displacements, entangled two-photon microscopy, lithography, metrology, teleportation of
optical images and quantum sensors, batteries and internet are briefly discussed.
In the second edition of both the volumes, comprehensive revision of the chapters in
the first edition and extensive enlargement through the addition of two chapters in volume

Quantum Field Theory
1.1 Introduction
Classical field theory makes it feasible to study about the fields within the formulation
of classical mechanics. The application of quantum mechanics to fields leads to quantum
field theory (QFT) [1,2]. The essential principles of QFT were developed by Paul Adrien
Maurice Dirac, Wolfgang Joseph Pauli, Richard Phillips Feynman and others during 1920–
1950. What are the salient features of QFT? What does it impart to our knowledge that
was not present already in classical field theory and in quantum mechanics? The basic
characteristic ideas of QFT are two fold:
1. The dynamical degrees of freedom are operators, functions of space and time and
they satisfy appropriate commutation relations.
2. The interactions of the fields are essentially local. So, the equations of motion
and the corresponding commutation relations in space-time depend only on the
behaviour of the fields and their derivatives at the point of consideration.
Relativistic and nonrelativistic systems can be quantized in the Schr¨odinger, Heisen￾berg and interaction pictures. Schr¨odinger picture is rarely considered in QFT because in
most cases Heisenberg picture is considerably easier to perform quantization. In QFT the
Klein–Gordon (KG), Dirac and Maxwell equations describing spin-0, 1/2 and 1 particles,
respectively, need to be quantized. The predictions of QFT are found to be in best agree￾ment with experimental observations in all physics. It is a powerful tool for particle physics
and condensed matter physics, many body problems in superconductivity, theory of metals
and quantum Hall effect.
In the present chapter first we indicate the need for QFT. We describe the basic ideas
involved in the classical field theory (CFT). Next, we obtain quantum equations for fields
and quantize the nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger equation and electromagnetic field in vacuum.
We discuss the interaction of charged particles and the electromagnetic field in the frame
work of QFT. Then we quantize KG and Dirac equations.
1.2 Why Quantum Field Theory?
In quantum mechanics space and time are considered differently. Here time appears as
a parameter while space coordinates become operators and are observables. Further, in
the quantum theory the total number of particles are assumed to be remain the same.
But there are situations where the number of particles is changed. Consider the following
problems.
DOI: 10.1201/9781003172192-1 12 Quantum Field Theory
1. In certain processes particles are created and destroyed. An example is β-decay
where a neutron decays into a proton, an electron and an anti-neutrino. This
decay process is represented as n → p + e− + γe
. A neutron is annihilated while
the particles p and e− and γe are created. The total number of particles is not
conserved.
2. In relativistic theory according to Einstein’s mass-energy relation E = mc2 new
particles can be created from energy. For example, if an electron and a positron
collide with enough high energy then an additional electron-positron pair would
be created: e− + e+ → e
− + e+ + e− + e+. In this process the total number of
particles is changed due to the creation of new particles.
3. In the problem of interaction of electromagnetic field with a system, we handle
the system as quantum mechanical while the field as classical. However, we treat
the absorption and emission of radiation as absorption and emission of photons.
In this case the number of particles change.
4. The negative energy states in Dirac equation imply the existence of antiparticles
are created in various processes.
5. In certain processes the initial and final states contain same particles but in the
intermediate states creation and annihilation of other particles occur. The final
results are affected by the processes in the intermediate states.
The quantum theory must include the above possibilities that alter the number of particles
in the system and creation and annihilation of particles. This is done in QFT. In the corre￾spondence limit ~ → 0, nonrelativistic Schr¨odinger equation reduces to classical mechanics
but not to relativistic equation. The Dirac equation has no ground state. For a system of
identical particles the wave function must be symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to
exchange the coordinates of the particles. This makes the wave function highly complex.
These problems can be resolved by considering quantum fields rather than particles.
1.3 What is a Field?
The concept of field was originally introduced in classical theory to account for the interac￾tion between two systems separated by a finite distance. For example, in classical physics the
electric field E(X, t) is a three-component function and the interaction between two charged
systems 1 and 2 is viewed as the interaction of the system 2 with the created electric field
of system 1.
A function φ(X) that depends on one or more variables X is called a field variable or
simply a field. A field is an entity and not a particle present in space. The field of a system
carries momentum, energy and other observables. A field depends on space coordinates
but can vary with time also. We can write the field variable as φ(X, t). The mathematical
equations describing the connection between X, t and φ are the field equations. A theory
describing a system in terms of one or more fields is called a field theory. The position and
momentum variables of a classical particle are fields and the equation of motion is the field
equation. Thus, classical mechanics is a field theory. We can treat the components of electric
and magnetic fields as variables and the Maxwell equations as field equations. Therefore,
electromagnetism is a field theory.
The field amplitude φ(X, t) may vary from point to point in space and their values
at different points are independent of each other. In field theory, each of the values of
the space coordinates are treated as generalized coordinates. So, the field has an infiniteClassical Field Theory 3
number of degrees of freedom. Therefore, it can be considered analogous to a system with
an infinite number of particles. In quantum theory the field concept takes a new dimension.
The basic idea of QFT is that we associate particles with field such as the electromagnetic
field (photon).
1.4 Classical Field Theory
Before we get into the problem of quantization in quantum mechanics, first we discuss some
basic methods involved in the formulation of classical field theories. Quantization of a clas￾sical field turns a classical field into an operator capable of creating particles from a vacuum
[3]. Quantization of classical equations of motion of a system refers to the replacement of nu￾merical functions representing the positions and momenta by operators obeying prescribed
commutation relations. A notable point is that results of quantum mechanics follow from
this prescription. How do we obtain field equations? Generally, they are derived from a
variational principle. In this principle, starting from the Lagrangian we construct a quantity
called action and obtain its stationary value.
1.4.1 Lagrangian Formalism
In classical mechanics the Lagrangian L is denoted as L(q, q, t ˙ ). We consider it as a spatial
integral of some function of a field. The integrand have the dimensions of Lagrangian density
(L). We denote the fields as φ
A. Different values of A yields different fields. For simplicity
we drop the superscript A and denote the fields as φ.
We write L as
L(φ, φ˙) = Z
L(φ, φ, ∂φ/∂x ˙ ) dx , (1.1)
where L is assumed to depend on φ and φ˙
. φ takes the role of coordinate q in L(q, q, t ˙ ). L is
assumed to depend on space derivative also because space coordinates are also independent
parameters. Relation between L and equations of motion exists.
In the Lagrangian formulation, we begin from the action S
S =

Ldt =

dt
Z x2
x1
dxL(φ, φ, ∂φ/∂x ˙ )
=
Z
Ω
Ldτ , dτ = dx dt , (1.2)
where Ω specifies the space-time region of our interest and t1 and t2 are the initial and
end values of time. Often Ω is chosen to be all space-time. S given by Eq. (1.2) is simply a
number. In general, S will change if the field is changed and hence it is called a functional.
We assume the periodic boundary condition φ(x + L) = φ(x).
The principle of least action, which states that among all possible motions the system
follows the one for which S is extremum, is used to find the equations of motion. In field
theory the principle of least action says that the system evolves through fields that make
the action S stationary against small variations of the fields. Suppose we vary the fields φ
slightly around the true fields φ
0 and write
φ
0
(x, t) = φ(x, t) + δφ(x, t). (1.3)4 Quantum Field Theory
For fixed t1 and t2 we have δφ(x, t1) = δφ(x, t2) = 0. Consequently, the change in S, δS,
becomes zero to the first-order in δφ making δS = S
0 − S. We write
δS =

Equation (1.11) is the classical field equation and is called Euler–Lagrange equation for the
Lagrangian density. This equation is the condition for the action to be stationary. Thus, in
field theory there is a relation between the Lagrangian density and equations of motion.
Equation (1.11) in covariant form reads as
∂µ
∂L
∂(∂µφ)
=
∂L
∂φ . (1.12)
For the field equations to be relativistically invariant the requirement is that the equations
must be in covariant form, that is, in all inertial frame the equations should have the same
form. The field equation obtainable from L is covariant if L is a relativistically scalar density,
that is,
L
0
(φ
0
, φ˙
0
, ∇0φ
0
, t0
) = L(φ, φ,˙ ∇φ, t), (1.13)
where prime and unprime refer to two inertial frames. The dependence of Lagrangian density
on x is only through the fields φ. If it explicitly depends on x then the relativistic invariance
will be violated. Since dX dt = dx dy dz dt is relativistically invariant we have
S
0 =
Z
L
0 dX dt
0 =
Z
LdX dt = S . (1.14)
So, action is unchanged under the Lorentz transformation. The equations of motion have
the same form in both the coordinate systems and are thus covariant as given by Eq. (1.12).
The invariance of a system under continuous symmetry transformations leads to con￾tinuity equations and conservation laws. The derivation of the conservation laws from the
invariance of the Lagrangian density is known as Noether theorem. This theorem states
that every continuous transformation that leaves the action S unchanged leads to a con￾servation law. For example, the conservation of four-momentum and of angular momentum
follows from the invariance of the Lagrangian density L under translations and rotations,
respectively.

1.4.2 Hamiltonian Formalism
Quantization is much more straight-forward in the Hamiltonian formalism. The Hamiltonian
formalism is based on the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian with respect to φ˙
. Given6 Quantum Field Theory
a function f(x), introduce a new variable p = df /dx in place of x and replace f by g(p) =
px − f. g(p) is called Legendre transform of f(x). We have x = ∂g/∂p. The Legendre
transform of L(φ, φ, t ˙ ) gives π (the canonical conjugate momentum) in place of φ˙ (velocity).
Let us consider H(t, φ, p) = pφ˙ − L, where H is the Hamiltonian. π and φ˙ are related
by the equation p = ∂L/∂φ˙
. If the volume is divided into a number of small cells with the
volume of ith cell as δτi then the derivatives of L with respect to φ and φ˙ at a point (cell)
are denoted as ∂L/∂φ and ∂L/∂φ˙ and are called functional derivatives. In this case the
Euler–Lagrange equation becomes
∂L

In analogy with the classical Hamiltonian H =

i − L. We define the momentum density as
π(x) = ∂L

1.5 Quantum Equations for Fields
Classical field is a quantity varying continuously in space-time and its evolution is described
by certain wave equation. In contrast to this, the quantum field is an operator and it creates
states of definite momentum and energy. How do we obtain quantum equations for fields?
The starting point is the field equations. In quantum mechanics the classical field φ is a
wave field (here onwards we use ψ in place of φ) and ψi and πi should be Hermitian. Here
i denotes the cell number.
Similar to the commutation relations [qi
, qj ] = 0, [pi
, pj ] = 0 and [qi
, pj ] = i~δij we write
[ψ(r, t), ψ(r
0
, t)] = 0 , (1.28a)
[π(r, t), π(r
0
, t)] = 0 , (1.28b)
[ψ(r, t), π(r
0
, t)] = i~δ
3
(r − r
0
). (1.28c)
As an alternative, ψ can be expanded in a complete orthonormal set of functions, say, uk,
as ψ(r, t) = Pak(t)uk(r). Here ak are the field coordinates. The field equations can be
expressed in terms of either ψ or ak. Further, applying periodic boundary conditions, we
can expand ψ in Fourier series and treat the Fourier coefficients as operators obeying the
commutation relations.
Let us denote the components of field ψ as ψ1, ψ2, . . .. Then the Lagrangian density of
the field is
L = L(ψ1, ψ2, . . . , ∇ψ1, ∇ψ2, . . . , t). (1.29)8 Quantum Field Theory

The equation of motion of a dynamical variable Fj is written as

[Fj , H] . (1.33)
The commutation relations (1.28) take the form
[ψj (r, t), ψj

[πj (r, t), πj

In QFT ψ is generally complex: ψ = ψ1 + iψ2. The commutation relations are now given by
Eqs. (1.34) with j = 1, 2. It can be shown that the field Eqs. (1.11) obtained by independent
variations of ψ1 and ψ2 are equivalent to those obtained by independent variations of ψ and
ψ

1.6 Quantization of Nonrelativistic Wave Equation

∇2ψ + V ψ . (1.35)
Equation (1.35) is obtained from classical Hamiltonian by replacing the dynamical variables
q and p by their corresponding operators. This is called first quantization. Quantization of
the Schr¨odinger equation by replacing the wave function by an operator is known as second
quantization, the term coined by Dirac. QFT is the quantization of the quantum mechanical
wave equation.
P
On what basis did Dirac introduce the notion of second quantization? If we write ψ =
Caψa then P|Ca|
2 = 1. This is for a single particle. For a set of N such independent
particles we have P|Ca
√
N|
2 = N. In this case |Ca|
2
is the probable number of particles
in the state ψa and hence it must be an integer. This requirement is the basic motivation
for Dirac’s introduction of second quantization [1].Quantization of Nonrelativistic Wave Equation 9
1.6.1 Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Densities Associated with the
Schrodinger Equation ¨

In this case [ψ

∗ and π cannot be regarded as a pair of
canonically conjugate variables. Further, π

formulation of field description. The Hamiltonian density H given by Eq. (1.22b) becomes

So, in the number representation, the ket |n1, n2, . . . , nk, . . .i has the energy eigenvalue
k nkEk. In the representation |n1, n2, . . . , nk, . . .i of the field, the number of particles in
each state k is a positive integer or zero. The commutation relations (1.44) lead to the
theory of many particles that obey Bose–Einstein statistics. The commutation relations
(1.44) follow if the state ket |n1, n2, . . .i is symmetric with respect to exchange of two
particles.
1.6.3 Systems of Fermions
The commutation relations of the field operators lead us to describe a system of bosons.
One must find a quantum field formulation to yield a theory of particles that obey
Fermi–Dirac statistics. For fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle postulates that the
occupation number nk be only either 0 or 1 and that the state function |n1, n2, . . .i
be antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of any two indistinguishable parti￾cles. Ernst Pascual Jordan and Eugene Paul Wigner obtained the QFT to describe
a fermion field by replacing the commutator brackets (1.44) with the anticommutator

Using Eqs. (1.58), the Eq. (1.61a) becomes Eq. (1.57b). Equation (1.61b) is simply
Eq. (1.57c). Operating ∇· on both sides of Eq. (1.58b) we get (1.57d). Similarly, from
Eq. (1.58a), taking ∇× on both sides, we obtain Eq. (1.57a).

∇ × A = HB in Eq. (1.64b) we get Eq. (1.57b). The definitions of E and HB given by
Eqs. (1.58) satisfy Eqs. (1.57a) and (1.57d). Equation (1.57c) cannot be obtained through
the Hamiltonian formalism. However, we can say that we wish to have the solutions with
∇ · E = 0 which implies ∇ · π = 0. We can show that if ∇ · E = 0 or ∇ · π = 0 is valid at
one instant of time, then this condition is valid at all times. We have from (1.64b)

1.7.2 Quantum Equations
To quantize the field, we use the commutation relations (1.28). With φ = 0 we get the
commutation relations for the field operators as
[Aj (r, t), Ak(r

If we assume that the electromagnetic field is confined to a large box of size of volume

The kλ are real unit polarization vectors.
Since the electromagnetic wave in free space is transverse in nature and has two inde￾pendent polarizations, the polarization vectors satisfy the conditions
k · kλ = 0, kλ · kλ0 = δλλ0 , λ, λ0 = 1, 2. (1.78)
This classical description can be changed to quantum description by replacing Akλ and πkλ
into operators satisfying the commutation relations
[Akλ, πk0λ0 ] = i~δkk0δλλ0 . (1.79)16 Quantum Field Theory
These operators can be expressed in terms of the boson (photon) creation operator a

The vector potential (1.75) satisfies Eq. (1.74) if
Akλ(t) = Akλ(0) e−iω(k)t
. (1.81)
Substituting (1.75) and (1.81) in (1.74) we get the dispersion relation ω(k) = c|k|.
The commutation relations (1.68a) then lead to the commutation relations

akλ as the number operator of the photon with momentum ~k, energy

says that the energy associated with each plane electromagnetic wave is an integer multiple
of the fundamental quantum ~ω = hν = ~kc. As the summation extends up to infinity,
the sum of the zero-point energy ~ω/2 gives infinity. This infinite zero-point energy doeInteraction of Charged Particles with Electromagnetic Field 17
not lead to any difficulty as the interaction depends only on the change of the occupation
number nkλ. The quantization of the electromagnetic field corresponds to the creation or
annihilation of elementary excitations, namely photon with energy ~ω, momentum ~k and
polarization kλ.
We notice that the field equation for A(r, t) shows that the coefficients akλ obey the
classical harmonic oscillator equation. A(r, t) is a vector operator-valued field with akλ and

of the kth field mode satisfying the Heisenberg equations of motion for a set of quantum
harmonic oscillators. As A(r, t) defines an operator for every point r in space, it is called
a field. r is not an operator but a parameter. In nonrelativistic quantum physics we can
speak about hri whereas in QFT we can speak about hA(r, t)i but not hri because r is not
an observable.
A operates on ψ and creates and destroys photons. As pointed out in [4] A is a physically
meaningful field since it has a measurable expectation value at each and every point r in
space. That is, a quantized classical field does not cease to be a field.
Quantum fields possess a particle-like property which classical fields do not possess.
Notice that quantum fields are made of quanta. Thus, quanta cannot vanish but must be
instantly created and destroyed (like particles). As quanta carry energy and momenta, they
can hit like a particle.

The Euler–Lagrange equation is
ψtt − ∇2ψ + m2ψ = 0 . (1.107)
Defining ∂
2 = ∂
2/∂t2 − ∇2
the Eq. (1.107) can be rewritten as
∂
2ψ + m2ψ = 0 . (1.108)
It is the KG equation.
1.9.1.1 Second Quantization
Now, quantize the KG equation. We obtain the equation π = ψ˙ and Eq. (1.108) from
Heisenberg equation of motion. The commutation relations are
[ψ(r, t), π(r
0

[ψ(r, t), ψ(r
0

0
, t)] = 0 . (1.109b)
The field ψ(r, t) represents an infinite number of operators and they give the values of the
field at various positions r in space and then conjugate operators π(r, t).

the commutation relations between a and a

For relativistic KG equation the charge and current densities are ρ = (1/(mc2
)) Eψ∗ψ
and J = (~/(2mi)) [ψ
∗∇ψ − ψ∇ψ
∗
], respectively. For a real field (ψ = ψ
∗
), the operator
ψ becomes a Hermitian as ψ = ψ
†
. Hence, the charge density operator ρ and the current
density operator J vanish. Therefore, the KG equation for real scalar field when quantized
applicable to a neutral particle alone. Also, ψ transforms as a scalar (pseudo-scalar) under
Lorentz transformations and hence the spin of the KG field is zero. So, the real KG field ψ
describes neutral pion π
0
that has zero spin and mass. But if neutral spin zero particles with
mass possess additional degrees of freedom like hypercharge then they cannot be described
by a real KG field.

cannot detect this infinite energy shift experimentally because in experiments we measure
only the energy difference from the ground state of H. That is, the last term in the above

1.9.2 Klein–Gordon Equation with Complex Scalar Field
We have seen that the KG equation for real field, on quantization describes creation and
annihilation of chargeless particles with mass. Another KG field is a complex field ψ(r, t)
that may be regarded as made up of two independent real scalar fields ψ1(r, t) and ψ2(r, t):
ψ(r, t) = 1
√
2
(ψ1 + iψ2) , ψ∗
(r, t) = 1
√
2
(ψ1 − iψ2) . (1.124)
The Lagrangian density for such a field is

Then the conjugate momentum densities are given by

The Hamiltonian density is H =

to the KG equations

− ∇2ψi + m2ψi = 0 , i = 1, 2 . (1.129)

√
2ω
e

, (1.130)
where ω

We expand them in terms of uk as

Since ψi are real, the second term (the Hermitian conjugate of the first term) is also included
in Eq. (1.131). We make use of the following commutation relations to quantize the fields
ψi
:
h
ai(k), a

Then according to the previous section this complex field will represent two types of particles
of spin zero.

√

[a1(k) + ia2(k)] . (1.134)
Using Eq. (1.134) we can prove that a, b and their Hermitian conjugates satisfy the com￾mutation rules
[a(k), a†
(k

)] = [b(k), b†
(k

All other combinations of the commutation brackets are zero.
The operators a
†
(k) and a(k) create and annihilate one type of particle while b
†
(k)
and b(k) create and annihilate the second type of particle. na(k) = a
†
(k)a(k) and nb(k) =
b
†
(k)b(k) are the occupation number operators of these two types of particles. The continuity
equation ∇ · J + ∂ρ/∂t = 0 gives
J = ie [(∇ψ

] , (1.136a)
ρ = −ie(ψψ˙∗ − ψ

Q = e

k
[na(k) − nb(k)] . (1.138)
The a particles have a charge e and the b particles have −e. Except for the sign of their
charge these particles possess identical properties. The interchange of a and b changes only
the sign of Q. In relativistic QFT, every charge particle is automatically accompanied by an
antiparticle with opposite charge. This is a general result in field theory and also applicable
to particles with other spin values. The meson π
+ and π
− with spin zero are described by
the complex KG field. However, the charge need not necessarily be an electrical charge. The
neutral mesons K0 and K
0
are also described by the complex KG field as they have opposite
hypercharge: Y = 1 for the K0 and Y = −1 for the K
0
. The hypercharge is an intrinsic
degree of freedom like charge, and they are related to electrical charge Q, the isospin Iz,
the strangeness S and the baryon number N by Y = 2(Q − Iz) and S = Y − N.
Substituting (1.130) in (1.128) and using the relations (1.132), (1.134) and (1.135) we
get

We note from (1.153) that the field Hamiltonian would not be positive definite whereas the
total charge will be always positive definite. There will be no lower bound to the energy. A
system described by this Hamiltonian would not be stable. The excitation of the particle
of the operator b

{bi(k), bi

1.11 Gauge Field Theories
In realistic quantum mechanics we have the difficulties in interpreting the KG equation
and the Dirac equation as single-particle wave equations. Single-particle wave functions are
commonly used to describe systems when the number of particles is conserved. Relativistic
consideration leads to creation and annihilation of particle-amplitude pairs. In such situ￾ations, we have found that the wave function is identified as a field. The wave function
and its canonical momentum become operators which satisfy the usual communication re￾lations. When we quantize the classical Maxwell field of electromagnetism, photons with
spin-1 emerge as the quantum of the electromagnetic field, and so the theory describes a
system with any number of particles. Quantization of KG equation and the Dirac fields lead
to quanta which have spin-0 and spin-1/2, respectively.
A QFT is usually expressed in a Lagrangian formulation. The symmetries of Lagrangian
density leads to conservation laws through the use of Noether’s theorem. Symmetry princi￾ples play an important role in physics. A transformation of a physical system that acts the28 Quantum Field Theory
same way everywhere and at all times is said to have a global symmetry. Due to invariance
of laws of physics under spatial, rotational and time transformations, linear momentum,
angular momentum and energy are, respectively, conserved. Due to the invariance under
a change in phase of the wave functions of charged particles, electric charge is conserved.
These are examples of global symmetry. Another important symmetry is the gauge (local)
symmetry. We have seen that under a gauge transformation of the electromagnetic poten￾tials, the electric and magnetic fields do not change. Gauge invariance forces the existence
of special particles, gauge bosons.
QFTs incorporate quantum concepts for fields as well as particles. Conventional parti￾cles, such as electrons, are reinterpreted as states of the quantum field. The most important
QFTs for describing elementary particle physics are gauge theories. The classic idea of gauge
theory was given by Hermann Weyl. Gauge field theories have revolutionized our under￾standing of elementary particle interactions during the second half of twentieth century.
1.11.1 Quantum Electrodynamics
The quantum version of Maxwell theory known as quantum electrodynamics (QED) gives an
extremely accurate account of electromagnetic fields and force. QED improved the accuracy
for certain earlier quantum theory predictions by second-orders of magnitude as well as
predicting new splitting of energy levels. QED is an ablelian gauge theory with symmetry
graph U(1). Electromagnetic field is the gauge field which mediates the interaction between
the charged spin-1/2 fields. It was developed in the late 1940s by Richard Phillips Feynman,
Julian Seymour Schwinger and Shinichiro Tomonaga independently. Under QED, charged
particles interact by exchange of virtual photons, that do not exit inside the interaction and
only serve as carriers of momentum and force.
In the 1960, a formulation of QED led to the unification of theories of weak and
electromagnetic interactions by making use of SU(2) × U(1) gauge group. Sheldon
Glashow, Mohammad Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg independently proposed a unified
electro-weak theory which is based on the exchange of four particles: the photon for electro￾magnetic interaction, two charged W particles and a neutral z particle for weak interaction.
1.11.2 Quantum Chromodynamics
Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) describes the string or ‘color’ force that binds quarks to
form baryons and mesons. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory invariant under SU(3). There
are three different charges (colors) in strong interaction unlike in QED, where there is only
one charge (electric). In QCD there are eight types of generalized electromagnetic fields
(Eα, Bα), α = 1, 2, . . . , 8. The associated quanta are called gluons Gα. They are massless
spin-1 objects. The exchange of gluons between quarks bind or glue the quarks together to
form the neutron or proton. That is, the interaction is governed by gluons.
1.11.3 The Standard Model
The standard model (SM) of high energy physics essentially consists of two parts [5]: (i)
Electro-weak dynamics unifying electromagnetic and weak interactions and (ii) chromo￾dynamics governing strong interactions. Gravity has been left out in SM. Analogous to
electrodynamics, in electro-weak dynamics there are four types of generalized electromag￾netic fields denoted as (Ei
, Bi), i = 1, 2, 3, 4. One of (Ei
, Bi) being the Faraday–Maxwell
electromagnetic field. There are four electro-weak quanta also called electro-weak gauge
bosons. One of them is the photon (γ) which mediates electromagnetic interaction while
the three others W+, W− and Z mediate weak interaction.Concluding Remarks 29
According to the SM the constituents of the universe are classified into field sector and
particle sector. In the field sector, there are twelve gauge fields γ, W+, W−, Z, G1, G2, . . .,
G8. The quanta of them are essentially particles with spin 1 (bosons). The particle sector
consists of spin 1/2 particles (fermions). It is noteworthy to point out that fields have their
quanta that are particles and in QFT each particle in the particle sector has its quantum
field. For example, electron is the quanta of the electron field. Thus, QFT unifies field and
particle concepts [5].
1.12 Concluding Remarks
Quantum electrodynamics was the first successful QFT to be developed in the middle of the
last century and it described completely with high accuracy all electromagnetic interactions.
In the next few decades, it was extended to describe weak and strong interactions. It has
now been proved that quantum fields provide the appropriate framework to describe a wide
class of phenomena and interactions. Though QFT is mainly used by particle physicists to
shed light on the fundamental particles of matter and their interactions, condensed matter
physicists also make use of it widely. There are two methods to quantize the fields. One
is the canonical quantization of the field. Another method which is predominately used is
the functional method based on path integral formulation of quantum mechanics developed
by Feynman. It has been found that the path integral method is found to be superior to
the canonical method in many respects to describe gauge fields. A preliminary study of
numerical evaluation of QFT has been reported [6–8].

Path Integral Formulation
2.1 Introduction
The conventional approach to quantum mechanics begins with the classical Hamiltonian and
changes observables to noncommuting operators. Canonically conjugate observables have
to be noncommuting operators in order to satisfy the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
The dynamics of a quantum mechanical system is given by the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation. In the early 1940s, Richard Feynman realized that it would be possible to con￾struct a quantum model using the classical Lagrangian approach (a method closely related
to the action integral). Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac had earlier pointed out that eit
times
the Lagrangian was analogous to a transformation function for the wave function in which
the wave function at one instant could be related to the wave function at a next instant in
a time interval of t by multiplying with such an exponential function. Feynman found the
exponential phase factor to be the action S which is the time integral of the Lagrangian.
Further, he noticed that it was necessary to perform integrals over all space variables at
every instant of time to find the transition amplitudes. He developed a way for describing
and evaluating the integration using the idea of integral over all paths. In Feynman’s ap￾proach, the particles are described using amplitudes calculated along the paths they may or
may not follow. These amplitudes behave like waves, their phase changes as the quantum
system moves along the path and the amplitudes for all paths superpose and interfere. This
interference between all paths is called as sum-over-histories and the resulting amplitude is
connected in the same way that the amplitude of a wave function is linked to probability
as magnitude-squared.
Generally, the quantum mechanics based on the Schr¨odinger equation is preferred for
a system of particles. But path integral formulation of quantum mechanics [1–6] finds ap￾plications in more complicated situations, particularly, in quantum field theory (QFT).
There are two widely used approaches to QFT. The first is based on field operators and
the canonical quantization of these operator fields which was discussed in chapter 1. The
second approach uses the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. A path integral
description of field theory is used in high energy physics. The main development in high
energy particle physics has been the emergence of gauge field theory as the basic frame￾work for theories of weak, electromagnetic and strong interactions. Path integral method
is highly appropriate for describing the gauge field theory. Path integrals also play a role
in some of the theories of quantum gravity. For example, in string theory, path integral
can be used to calculate the probability of given string interactions. In quantum cosmology,
proposals for the origin of universe are formulated using path integrals. In this framework,
the probability of the evolution of the universe into a certain state results from the sum over
all possibilities for how such an evolution might take place. Further, it gives a physically
appealing and intuitive approach of looking at quantum mechanics. We can understand the
classical limit of quantum mechanics in a clear way with path integrals.
DOI: 10.1201/9781003172192-2 3334 Path Integral Formulation
We shall discuss the formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of path integrals as it
is the basis on which the field theory is developed.
2.2 Time Evolution of Wave Function and Propagator
Consider the one-dimensional time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation
i~
∂
∂tψ(x, t) = Hψ(x, t) , (2.1)
where ψ(x, t) is the wave function in Schr¨odinger picture and the Hamiltonian H is inde￾pendent of time. The purpose of solving the Schr¨odinger equation lies in finding the time
evolution operator which is able to generate the time translation of the given system. The
time evolution operator transforms the state at, say, t = 0 to a future time t as
|ψ(t)i = U(t)|ψ(0)i . (2.2)
As H is independent of time in the Schr¨odinger picture, from Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2), we get
for t > 0,
U(t) = e−(i/~)Ht
. (2.3)
More explicitly, we write
U(t) = θ(t) e−(i/~)Ht
, (2.4a)
where
θ(t) =



1, for t > 0
1/2, for t = 1/2
0, for t < 0.
(2.4b)
The time evolution operator appear as the Green’s function for the Schr¨odinger equation
and satisfies

i~
∂
∂t − H

U(t) = i~δ(t) . (2.5)
Determination of this operator is equivalent to finding its matrix elements in a given basis.
In the coordinate basis |xi, we define
xˆ|xi = x|xi. (2.6)
Denote the state in which the particle is at t = 0 as |xii. What is the probability amplitude
A for a particle to be in |xf i at some time t? It is given by
A = K(xf , t; xi
, 0) = 

xf

e
−(i/~)Ht
xi

. (2.7)
K is called the propagator from |xii to |xf i. K is also called Feynman’s kernel. It is the
transition amplitude between the states |xii and |xf i determined at two times t0 = 0 and
t0 + t. Further,
ψ(x, t) = Z
dxi K(xf , t; xi
, 0)ψ(xi
, 0) . (2.8)
Equation (2.8) indicates the way in which the particle or the transition amplitude propagates
from (xi
, t = 0) to (xf , t). That is, K has details about the evolution of quantum systems.
Equation (2.8) indicates that ψ(x, t) can be determined from K.
In the next section, we obtain an expression for the propagator K in the form of a
summation (or integral) over all possible paths between |xii and |xf i.Path Integral Representation of Propagator 35
2.3 Path Integral Representation of Propagator
Let us begin by dividing the time interval 0 to t into two intervals: 0 to t1 and t1 to t.
Writing
e
−(i/~)Ht = e−(i/~)H(t−t1)
e
−(i/~)Ht1
(2.9)
the propagator K becomes
K =


xf

e
−(i/~)H(t−t1)
e
−(i/~)Ht1

xi

. (2.10)
Because R
dx1|x1ihx1| = 1 we write
K =


xf

e
−(i/~)H(t−t1)
Z
dx1|x1ihx1| e
−(i/~)Ht1

xi

=
Z
dx1 K(xf , t; x1, t1)K(x1, t1; xi
, 0) . (2.11)
We point out that this is simply an expression of the quantum rule for combining amplitudes.
It is an expression of the composition property of the propagator K. More precisely, when a
system undergoes transition from |xii to |xf i then it must be somewhere at an intermediate
time t1. Denoting the state at t1 as |x1i we are able to compute the amplitude for the
propagator through the state |x1i and integrate over all possible states. The fact that this
scheme applies to amplitudes rather than probabilities is a striking feature of quantum
mechanics.
Now, suppose we divide the time interval t into N (large) steps with an infinitesimal
step size δt = t/N. Then the propagator K becomes

Representation of transition amplitude (propagator) as a sum over all N small steps.
In Eq. (2.13) the initial and final states (corresponding to j = 0 and N, respectively)
are not integrated over. Defining |x0i = |xii, |xN i = |xf i the above equation is rewritten
as

The above equation indicates that K or the amplitude A is the integral of the amplitude
of all N-step paths. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.1. K is essentially summed over all possible
paths of the propagator or amplitude for each path:
K =

It must be noted that none of the paths are left out. That is, the path integral extends
over all possible paths. These paths may be differentiable, nondifferentiable, smooth and
nonsmooth. Further, the paths need not obey the classical equation of motion.
2.4 Connection Between Propagator and

Dx(t) is considered as a definition of the functional measure over the space of x(t). Dx(t)
represents the element of integration. Now, in the limit δt → 0, we write Eq. (2.22) in a
compact form as
K =
Z
Dx(t) e(i/~)
R t
0 mx˙
2/2 dt
. (2.24)
The integral in the above equation is seen as over all x(t) and ˙x(t). Remember that the
quantities in the integral are not operators.
When H = p
2/(2m) + V (x, t) we have
K =

The Lagrangian is L = T − V = mx˙
2/2 − V (x, t) and R t
Ldt = S[x(t)], where S is called
the classical action. Hence, for motion along the arbitrary path x(t), Eq. (2.25) becomes
K =
Z
Dx(t) e(i/~)S[x(t)]
. (2.26)
This is Feynman’s path integral or Feynman’s kernel for the transition amplitude. In the
above equation, the propagator is written as sum over all possible phase trajectories and
weighted by the classical action S. In the classical limit of S  ~, the quantity S/~ varies
rapidly between neighboring points and the destructive interference occurs. On the other
hand, along the classical path the action takes extremum and constructive interference
happens among the neighboring paths. Consequently, contribution to the integral comes38 Path Integral Formulation
from the paths close to the classical paths. This shows how classical mechanics is recovered
from quantum mechanics [7] in the limit ~ → 0.
In the expression (2.26), the path x(t) is unrestricted except at xi and xf . x(t) is
not the only one selected by the classical equation of motion, that is, not just a path
for which S is minimum. In the limit δt → 0, the integrals are over the intermediate points
(x1, x2, . . . , xN−1), therefore, consider all paths from xi to xf . In the path integral Dx(t),
the end points are fixed where the intermediate points are integrated over the entire space.
Any spatial configuration of the intermediate points gives a trajectory between the initial
and final points. Therefore, according to path integral the transition amplitude between an
initial and a final state is the sum over all paths, connecting the two points, with the weight
factor e
(i/~)S[x(t)]. We know that in classical mechanics the classical action determines the
dynamics. The classical system takes only a path on which the action S is minimum. In
quantum mechanics, all the possible paths contribute to the transition amplitude.
Note that the transformation matrix

is the propagator K(xf , t; xi

K contains the complete dynamics of the system. The path integral (2.26) gives a description
of finding K directly. If ψ is the wave function then K propagates ψ through the integral

2.5 Schrodinger Equation From Path Integral ¨
Formulation
We ask: Is the path integral formulation an equivalent picture of nonrelativistic quantum
mechanics? Inside the path integral we have classical functions and functionals rather
than operators. As a result simple classical manipulations of the path integral leads to
quantum mechanical identities. For example, we recover the time-dependent Schr¨odinger
equation. Because the Schr¨odinger equation is a differential equation, we need to obtain
the propagator for an infinitesimal variation of time δt from t = 0. The propagator for an
infinitesimal change δt is obtained from Eq. (2.25) as

it oscillates as x and t vary. The amplitude of the propagator depends only on time t. In
fact, the propagator for a quadratic Lagrangian system is proved to be
K(xf , tf ; xi

, (2.51)

2.7 Systems with Quadratic Lagrangian
We discuss a mathematical technique for a system which has the Lagrangian of the form
L = a(t) ˙x
2 + b(t) ˙xx + c(t)x
2 + d(t) ˙x + e(t)x + f(t) . (2.57)
Then we apply the method to the undamped harmonic oscillator, the linearly damped
harmonic oscillator and a particle in a uniform gravitational field with linear damping.
2.7.1 Mathematical Technique
For the systems with L of the form (2.57) the path integrals will have the variables appearing
up to the second degree in an exponent. These integrals are called Gaussian integrals. The
action S will be at most quadratic in x(t).
The transition amplitude for the system to go from the initial position (xi
, ti) to the
final position (xf , tf ) is given by
K =
Z
Dx(t) e(i/~)S[x(t)] =
Z xf
xi
Dx(t) e(i/~)
R tf
ti
L( ˙x,x,t) dt
. (2.58)Systems with Quadratic Lagrangian 43
Let xCM(t) be a classical path with the action S =
R
Ldt is extremum. So, the classical
action for the two points (from xi to xf ) is given by
SCM(xf , xi) = S(xCM(t)) . (2.59)
We represent x(t) in terms of the classical path xCM(t) and a new variable η(t): x(t) =
xCM(t) + η(t). η(t) is the deviation of x(t) from xCM(t). As the two end points xi and xf
are same for x(t) and xCM(t) we have
η(ti) = η(tf ) = 0 . (2.60)
As at each time t we have x and η differ by a constant dxi = dηi for each point ti
. So, we
write
Dx(t) = Dy(t) . (2.61)
Using Eq. (2.57), the action integral is written as
S[x(t)] = S (xCM(t) + η(t))
=
Z tf
ti
h
a ( ˙xCM + ˙η)
2 + b ( ˙xCM + ˙η) (xCM + η) + . . .i
dt. (2.62)
(Substitution of η = ˙η = 0 in the above equation gives the S[xCM(t)]). Expand the inte￾grands and write the right-side of (2.62) as the integrals corresponding to S[xCM(t)] plus the
others. Because the derivative of S with respect to xCM is zero (S is extremum), the inte￾grals over linear terms in η vanishes and only the quadratic terms present. Then Eq. (2.62)
becomes
S[x(t)] = S [xCM(t)] + Z tf
ti

a(t) ˙η
2 + b(t) ˙ηη + c(t)η
2

dt . (2.63)
S is a function of the parameters (xf , tf ; xi
, ti) and is also called 2-point action function.
Using (2.60), (2.61) and (2.63), we get
K(xf , tf ; xi

. (2.64)
Since all possible paths η(t) begin from and return to the point η = 0, the integral over
paths is a function only of times at the end points. Hence, K takes the form
K(xf , tf ; xi
, ti) = e(i/~)S[xCM(t)]F(ti
, tf ) . (2.65)
To determine K we need to find the classical action integral and the function F(ti
, tf ).

The paths over which the integral in the above equation is to be carried out go from

and xCM(t) is the solution of
x¨CM + ω
2xCM = 0 , xCM(ti) = xi
, xCM(tf ) = xf . (2.69c)
We can make change of variables in the path integral to η(t). Since all paths η(t) go from
0 at t = 0 and 0 at t = T, the fluctuations at any point on the trajectory is represented as
a Fourier series:
η(t) = X
n
an sin(nπt/T) . (2.70)
Then we convert the integrals with respect to η into the integrals with respect to an by
a linear transformation of η(t) to an with the Jacobian J. The Jacobian is a constant,
independent of ω, m and ~. So, it will appear as a multiplying constant in K.

2.7.3 Linearly Damped Harmonic Oscillator
Dissipative phenomena with a quantum origin manifest themselves in many different situ￾ations and hence the study of dissipative systems and their quantization is of a great theo￾retical and practical value. Many dissipative systems can be modelled as a linearly damped
harmonic oscillator. Hence, many different approaches have been followed in the past to
solve the Schr¨odinger equation for the linearly damped harmonic oscillator which contains
a velocity term as a damping factor in its Hamiltonian. Even though various solutions of
the Schr¨odinger equation were obtained for the linearly damped harmonic oscillator, it was
found that all those kinds of solutions always violated the uncertainty relation [8–10], one of
the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. However, in 1987, Um, Yeon and Kahng [11]
evaluated the exact quantum mechanical solution for the linearly damped harmonic oscilla￾tor using the path integral formulation without violating any fundamental law of quantum
mechanics.

2.9 Concluding Remarks
In this chapter we presented a brief introduction of path integral formalism. Note that
K(xf , tf ; xi
, ti) is the probability amplitude of finding a particle at xf at tf starting from
xi at ti
. Further |K(xf , tf ; xi
, ti)|
2
is the probability of finding the particle at xf at tf .
It has found applications in the study of intense laser-atom interactions [15], equilibrium
isotope effects [16], vibrational-rotational free energies [17] and one-dimensional chains [18].

Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
3.1 Introduction
In elementary particle physics, supersymmetry is a symmetry relating fermions and bosons.
Fermions are the particles with half-integral spin. Bosons are the particles with intrinsic
angular momentum and integral spin. Supersymmetry is a new symmetry of matter and it
renders the masses of elementary particles compatible with gravitation. One of the prime
predictions of it is that all the known elementary particles have partners called superpar￾ticles. Every fermion has a bosonic superpartner and vice-versa. For example, fermionic
quarks1 are partners of bosonic squarks2
. That is, quarks and squarks belong to the same
irreducible representation of supersymmetry. Some other supersymmetric pairs of parti￾cles are photon-photrino, lepton-slepton and graviton-gravitino. It has been hoped that
supersymmetric theories would be able to unify all the known forces. Hermann Nicolai
first defined supersymmetry for nonrelativistic quantum systems [1]. Applications of super￾symmetry have been found in quantum mechanics, nuclear and condensed matter physics.
Supersymmetric technique [2–9] can be employed to analytically solvable potentials to de￾termine bound state eigenspectra and scattering matrix.
Time-independent Schr¨odinger equation of certain physically interesting potentials are
exactly solved. Eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of possible stationary states are obtained. An
intriguing question is: Given a potential V (x) with energy eigenvalues En, are there other
potentials with the same energy eigenvalues? Using supersymmetric quantum mechanics
[2–5] one can show that for a potential V (x), there exists a one (continuous) parameter
(λ) set of potentials Vb(x) isospectral to V (x) for 0 < λ ≤ ∞ or −∞ ≤ λ ≤ −1 while
for λ = 0 or −1 Vb(x) has one bound state less than V (x). The potentials Vb(x) are called
supersymmetric partners of V (x).
The study of supersymmetry in quantum mechanics has three important applications:
1. So far several physically interesting potentials are solved exactly and their eigen￾values and eigenfunctions are determined. Employing supersymmetric theory,
isospectral potentials of several exactly solvable potentials can be identified.
2. For a new system one can identify whether its potential is an isospectral to any of
the known exactly solved systems. If it is not an isospectral then one can proceed
to solve it exactly or numerically.
3. For all the potentials studied the superpartner Vn is given by Vn(x) = V1 +
R(x). That is, there are certain spacial types of perturbations R(x) for which the
eigenstates can be determined exactly through simple formulas.

mechanics are presented. Particularly, the notions of supersymmetric potentials and part￾ners are defined. The features of supersymmetric partners are brought out. Next, a simple
procedure to construct all the supersymmetric partners of a given quantum mechanical
system whose all bound states are known is described. Then the technique is applied to
linear harmonic oscillator and particle in a box. Construction of complex potentials with
real eigenvalues is presented.
3.2 Supersymmetric Potentials
In this section the basic idea of supersymmetry in quantum mechanics is discussed. As shown
below, a given one-dimensional time-independent Hamiltonian H1 with potential V1 can be
rewritten in terms of the operators A+ and A− as A+A− + , where  is a constant. The
operator A−A+ helps to identify a new potential V2 and a Hamiltonian H2 = A−A+ +. V2
and H2 are called supersymmetric potential and supersymmetric Hamiltonian, respectively.

allows us to write
H1 = A
+A
− +  . (3.7)
Equation (3.6) is known as Riccati equation. Note that the second-order differential form of
H1 given by Eq. (3.1) is reexpressed as the product of two first-order differential operators
A+ and A− plus a constant . In the case of harmonic oscillator A+ and A− are creation and
annihilation operators, respectively, and  = E0 is the ground state energy. The condition
given by Eq. (3.6) is satisfied if
V (x) = φ
0
0
φ0
and  = E0 . (3.8)
Substitution of (3.8) in (3.6) gives φ
00
0 + 2 (E0 − V1(x)) φ0 = 0 which is the time-independent
Schr¨odinger Eq. (3.2). Without loss of generality, the ground state energy can be chosen as
zero also. Thus, any Hamiltonian H1 of the form of Eq. (3.1) with a ground state (φ0, E0)
can be factorized as Eq. (3.7) with  = E0 and

In Eq. (3.7) H1 is expressed as A+A− +. What will happen if we consider A−A+ instead
of A+A−? Particularly, we ask: Does the new Hamiltonian H2 = A−A+ + E0 have any
interesting feature? The following interesting results are obtained with the operator A−A+
[4,5].
1. If φ is an eigenfunction of A+A− then A−φ is an eigenfunction of A−A+.
2. The eigenvalues of A−A+ are the eigenvalues of A+A− (except its ground state
eigenvalue is missing in A−A+). That is, the Hamiltonians H1 = A+A− and
H2 = A−A+ are isospectral except for the ground state.
3. A−A+ +E0 defines a new Hamiltonian H2 and a simple connection exists between
the eigenstates of H1 and H2.
The above results are obtained explicitly in the next subsection.

3.2.2 Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions of A−A+
A+ and A− act as raising and lowering operators, respectively. A−φn leads to (n − 1)th
state. Multiplication of the eigenvalue equation A+A−φ = Eφ from left by A− gives
A
−A
+(A
−φ) = E(A
−φ). (3.15)
Thus, the eigenvalue of A−A+ is E while its eigenfunction is A−φ. Therefore, if φn is an
eigenfunction of H1 then the eigenfunction of A−A+ is A−φn. Because of A−φ0 = 0, the
above statement breaks down at n = 0 (ground state).

Thus, from a given potential V1(x) with the known ground state eigenfunction φ0 another
potential V2(x) can be constructed through Eq. (3.17). The potentials V1(x) and V2(x) are
called supersymmetric partner potentials [2–5].
The Hamiltonian H2 corresponding to V2(x) is given by (refer Eq. (3.18))
H2 = −

d

+ V2(x) = A
−A

Equation (3.19) implies that the eigenspectra of H2 are simply those of A−A+ + E0. The
Hamiltonians H1 and H2 whose potentials are V1 and V2, respectively, are called super￾symmetric partners. H1 and H2 share the same eigenvalue spectra except that the ground
state of H1 is missing in H2. The operators A− and its adjoint A+ act as transformation
operators between the Hamiltonians H1 and H2 as A+H2 = H1A+ and A−H1 = H2A+.
Solved Problem 2:
For a system with N-spatial dimension, N > 1 show that if the ground state is nonde￾generate it is not possible to find A such that the Hamiltonian cannot be factorized as
H = A+A− + E0, where E0 is the ground state energy.
Suppose that it is possible to find A− with H = A+A− + E0. A− must be a function of
∂/∂xk, k = 1, 2, . . . , N, otherwise, it is impossible for us to reconstruct the kinetic energy
term of H. φ0 is the ground state eigenfunction of H if and only if A−φ0 = 0. But A−φ0 = 0
is a partial differential equation with N variables, N > 1. It will have more than one linearly
independent solution φ0. That is, E0 is degenerate which is contradictory to our assumption
that E0 is nondegenerate. For a nondegenerate ground state energy H cannot be factorized
as A+A− + E0.
3.2.4 Why are H1 and H2 Called Supersymmetric Partners?
Now, we bring out the origin for calling H1 and H2 as supersymmetric partners. The term
supersymmetry was earlier used to denote a symmetry associated with certain field theories
which allows transformations between the field components with spins differing by ~/2. In
our discussion the word supersymmetry is used in a general sense. In field theory it is used to
describe systems subjected to an underlying algebra and can be obtained from the algebra
of supersymmetry.
Let us define the operators Q+, Q− and Hs as
Q
+ =

0 0
A− 0

, Q− =

0 A+
0 0 

. (3.20)
In supersymmetric quantum mechanics Q± are anticommuting:

Q
+, Q+
	
+
=

Q
−, Q−
	
+
= 0 . (3.21)
We can easily verify that Q+, Q− and Hs satisfy the following so-called supersymmetric
commutation if we take the ground state energy as zero (for a proof of these relations see
the exercises 10 and 11 at the end of this chapter)

− − Q
−Hs = 0 , (3.22b)

Hs, Q+

= 0 . (3.22c)56 Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
Because of this the Hamiltonians H1 and H2 are called supersymmetric partner Hamilto￾nians. H1 and H2 can be viewed, respectively, as fermionic and bosonic components of
the supersymmetric Hamiltonian Hs. The term supersymmetric Hamiltonian means in the
sense that a Hamiltonian defined in terms of Q+ and Q− that satisfy the same algebra of
the generators of the supersymmetry in field theory.
Equations (3.22b) and (3.22c) point out the invariance of the Hamiltonian under the
symmetry. Further, they imply that Q− and Q+ are conserved. Equation (3.21) states
that Q− and Q+ are fermion-like and express their anticommutator property. It moreover
conveys that the square of the generators is zero. Through Eq. (3.22a) time transformation
can be generated by means of a transformation in the Q− direction followed by one in the
Q+ direction.
As the potentials V1(x) and V2(x) are interconnected it is worth it to ask: Are the
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Hamiltonians H1 and H2 related? If so, how are
they related? Is it possible to determine systematically the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
of one of the Hamiltonians from the known eigenstates of the other? Interestingly, simple
relations exist between the eigenstates of H1 and H2 and will be established in the next
section.
3.2.5 An Example for Supersymmetric Hamiltonian
If Q± are taken as anticommuting operators, then Hs contains coordinates quantized by
commutators and anticommutators. They are mixed by supersymmetry transformation. As
an example, consider a particle with spin. The position and spin-orientation form a pair of
such coordinates. Consider

(ip + V (x))σ+ (3.23)
in which x and p are Bose degrees of freedom whereas σ+ and σ− are Fermi degrees of
freedom. The quantum condition for x and p is [x, p] = i. For σ+ and σ− we have the
anticommutative relations
{σ+, σ−}+ = {σ−, σ+}+ = 1 , {σ−, σ−}+ = {σ+, σ+}+ = 0 . (3.24)
Hence, as σ

Fermi sectors, respectively. These two possess the same energy levels as they are partner
Hamiltonians except for the ground state of H1.Supersymmetric Potentials 57

A system consisting of a bosonic and a fermionic oscillators with the same natural frequency

can be written as

H|nB, nFi = ω (nB + nF)|nB, nFi (3.31)
with nB = 0, 1, . . . and nF = 0, 1. Note that the eigenvalues of the fermionic number operator
are 0 and 1 and are consistent with the Pauli principle. On the other hand, the eigenvalues
of the bosonic number operator can take any positive integer values.

n then A−φ

n is the eigenfunction of H2 with the same eigenvalue E

for the ground state. Similarly, if φ

n is the eigenfunction of H2 with the eigenvalue E
(2)
n then
A+φ
(2)
n is the eigenfunction of H1 with the same eigenvalue E
(2)
n . A+φ

n creates (n + 1)th
eigenstate of H1 with the eigenvalue E

n . But the eigenvalue of (n + 1)th state of H1 is
designated as E

n+1, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. This relation
indicates that A−φ

n+1 leads to the eigenfunction of nth eigenstate of H2. Consequently,

except that the ground state of V1 is missing in V2. The mapping of spectra of H1 and H2 is
depicted in Fig. 3.1. Once the eigenfunctions of H1 are known then the eigenfunctions of H2
can be determined from Eq. (3.49). The above two are the connection between the super￾symmetric potentials V1 and V2. The step-like ladder structure of the eigenvalue spectrum

are the characteristic features of supersymmetric systems in one-dimension.
The hallmarks of the supersymmetric potentials V1 and V2 are:
1. If the eigenfunction φ
(1)
n+1 of H1 is normalized then φ
(2)
n of H2 is also normalized.
2. The operator A− converts an eigenfunction of H1 into an eigenfunction of H2
with the same energy.
3. A+ converts an eigenfunction of H2 into an eigenfunction of H1 with the same
energy. A+ and A− essentially connect the eigenstates of different energies of
supersymmetric partner potentials.
4. The operator A− destroys a node, that is, φ

n+1 has (n + 1) nodes whereas φ

n
has n nodes only.Hierarchy of Supersymmetric Hamiltonians 61

3.4 Hierarchy of Supersymmetric Hamiltonians
The procedure described in the previous section to find the Hamiltonian H2 can be easily
iterated to generate a Hamiltonian hierarchy with supersymmetric property [4,5]. That
is, the mth member (Hm) of the hierarchy has the same eigenvalue spectrum as the first
member H1, except for missing the (m − 1) eigenvalues of H1.
Suppose that H1 (Eq. (3.1)) with V1(x) admits M bound states. Then as shown in
sec. 3.2.3 the partner H2 and V2 are given by Eqs. (3.19) and (3.17), respectively. For

3.6 Generation of Complex Potentials with Real
Eigenvalues
Certain complex potentials with real eigenvalues or combination of real and complex eigen￾values are identified [10–16]. A method for constructing complex potentials with real eigen￾values has been developed based on the connection between a second-order equation of the
Schr¨odinger type and the so-called nonlinear Ermakov equation [16]. In this approach the
solutions of the Ermakov equation is used to set-up complex potentials which share their
eigenvalue spectrum with a given solvable real-valued potential. We present this approach
in this section.

H = −

With ψ(x) = u(x) it is desired to solve the eigenvalue equation
u
00 + 2( − V (x))u = 0, (3.72)
where u is complex and not necessarily normalizable.
Assume the solution of (3.72) as
u(x) = u0e
R x β(y)dy
, (3.73)Generation of Complex Potentials with Real Eigenvalues 67
where u0 is an arbitrary complex constant and β(x) is a complex function to be determined.
Substitution of (3.73) in (3.72) results in
β

2 + 2( − V ) = 0. (3.74)

obtained as

I + 2( − V ) = 0, (3.79a)

Equation (3.79b) can be rewritten as
βR = −

2
d

ln βI
. (3.80)
Defining βI = λ/α2

we obtain
βR =
α
0
α

d

ln α(x). (3.81)
What is the requirement for βR and βI to be real?
Now,
β = βR + iβI = (ln α(x))0 +
iλ
α2(x)
. (3.8268 Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics
Next, find an equation for α. Use of the above βRand βI

Schr¨odinger equation.
In terms of α the function u(x) is given by

superpotentials.

3.7 Concluding Remarks
In this chapter, we have demonstrated that if one of the partner systems (the Hamiltonians)
can be solved completely, by calculating the energy levels and the eigenfunctions, then the
supersymmetry formalism enables us to solve the partner problem. The supersymmetry
quantum mechanics has been generalized to generate supersymmetric partners from the
superpotential defined by higher excited eigenstates. For details see ref. [17]. Supersymmetry
of certain periodic potentials has also been studied [18]. The method has been applied
to position-dependent mass quantum systems [19–23] and bilayer graphene [24]. We note
that for the three linear harmonic oscillators considered in sec. 3.5 their supersymmetric
potentials are independent of x (which is not the case for a particle in a box). Therefore,
the shape of VN , N > 1 are the same as that of V1. They differ only in the parameters
that appear in them. Such a pair of supersymmetric potentials are called shape invariant
potentials [7,8]. For a pair of supersymmetric potentials V1 and V2 to be shape invariant they
must satisfy the requirement V2(x; a0) = V1(x; a1)+R(a1), where a0 is a set of parameters, a1
is a function of a0, that is a1 = f(a0), and R(a1) is independent of x. For the linear harmonic
oscillator R(a1) = ω, a0 = ω and a1 = ω. Algebraic nature [25,26] and generation [27–31] of
shape invariant potentials, inter-relations between additive shape invariant superpotentials
[32] and exactly solvable new class of potentials with finite discrete energies [33] have been
reported.
For a wide class of shape invariant Hamiltonians the interpolation of the two supersym￾metric partner Hamiltonians H = A+A− and Hs = (1 − s)A+A− + sA−A+, 0 ≤ s ≤ 1,
also retains shape invariance [34]. The Hamiltonian Hs has the same form as the original
Hamiltonian with shifted coupling constants and a shifted ground state energy. It has been
shown that the potential V1 = x
2 + 8(2x
2 − 1)/(2x
2 + 1)2
is a supersymmetric partner of
the linear harmonic oscillator V2 = x
2 + 5 [35]. Eigenpairs of a nonpolynomial oscillator is
obtained by supersymmetric formalism [35]. The eigenvalues for oscillators with quadratic
and sextic anharmonicities have been calculated by applying supersymmetry formalism [36].
Supersymmetric partners of the trigonometric P¨oschl–Teller potentials have also been ob￾tained [37]. In [24,38] supersymmetric quantum mechanics is employed to solve the effective
Hamiltonian for electrons in bilayer graphene.

Coherent and Squeezed States
4.1 Introduction
Certain superposition (linear combination) of energy eigenfunctions of linear harmonic os￾cillators are called coherent states because they are of significance in optics for the represen￾tation of coherent light waves. A hallmark of coherent states is that the variances (squares
of the uncertainties) of x and px are constant in time and further their product becomes the
minimum value allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. On the other hand, some
linear combinations of harmonic oscillator energy functions give rise to squeezed states. A
curious property of squeezed states is that the variances of x and px oscillate in time 180o
out of phase with one another with the frequency twice of the oscillator. The wave packet
of a coherent state possesses a minimum uncertainty. hxi and hpxi have the same oscillatory
forms as in the classical case. That is, a coherent state at macroscopic scales would repro￾duce the classical motion. The coherent states have also been called minimum uncertainty
coherent states, the Schrodinger coherent states ¨ or the Glauber coherent states [1–7]. The
squeezed states are sometimes referred to in the literature as two-photon coherent states.
Why is the study of coherent and squeezed states important? They provide promising
measurement results better than those usually expected from the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle. This is certainly the case where optical interferometers are used to detect very
weak forces such as gravitational wave detection [8], in optical communications [9], photon
detection techniques, atomic spectroscopy, optical wave guide tap, noise free amplification,
high-resolution spectroscopy, quantum communications and low-light-level microscopy, etc.
[10]. The radiative properties of atoms are highly sensitive to their contact with the envi￾ronment or the vacuum reservoir. If a normal vacuum reservoir is replaced with a squeezed
one, then it is possible to considerably reduce the line width of emission and absorption
spectra and this is very useful in enhancing the resolution in laser spectroscopy of atoms.
Note that the light from a laser is a coherent state. In optical fields coherent states are used
for dealing with the photon statistics and coherent properties. Now, coherent and squeezed
states form the basic language for quantum optics.
In this chapter some basic aspects of coherent and squeezed states are presented. We
obtain the Heisenberg uncertainty relation for the harmonic oscillator states and show
that it is a minimum for ground state. Next, we define coherent states and show that
they are the minimum uncertainty product states. A physical interpretation of coherent
states is then given. We outline a method for constructing coherent states from ground
state. We list some important properties of coherent states. Finally, we discuss the squeezed
states.

4.2 The Uncertainty Product of Harmonic
Oscillator
Let us calculate the uncertainties in the position and momentum of the linear harmonic
oscillator corresponding to the number states and also for various linear combinations of
them. The uncertainties are normally characterized by the variances:

2 = hp

i − hpxi

. (4.1b)
These averages can be calculated when ψ(x, t) of an oscillator is known. The integrals for
hxi, hx
2
i, hpxi and hp

x
i are often tedious to calculate in x-representation. However, they
can be easily calculated as follows making use of ladder operators a and a

The operators a±a
† operating on |ni give linear combinations of |n−1i and |n+ 1i. When
|ψi is a number state then the right-sides of Eqs. (4.6) produce terms such as hn|n − 1i and
hn|n + 1i. These terms become zero by orthogonality. Therefore, hxi = hpxi = 0. But ∆x
and ∆px of the number states are not equal to zero as shown below.

Equations (4.12) gives the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for the number states of the
harmonic oscillator. Its minimum value is 1/2 corresponding to n = 0, the ground state
(vacuum state). The ground state, n = 0, is thus called a minimum uncertainty state.
We write a most general state, a linear combination of the number states as
ψ(x, t) = X∞
n=0
Cn(t)|ni, (4.13)
where Cn(t) are generally complex numbers and the x-dependence is in |ni. Now, determine
Cn(t)’s. Substitution of Eq. (4.13) and H = n + 1/2 in the Schr¨odinger equation i∂ψ/∂t =

)t
. (4.15)
The probability of measuring n quanta in the oscillator is |Cn|
2 and is independent of time.
Now, an interesting and important question is: Is the energy linear combination state
ψ a minimum product state like the vacuum state? The answer is no. Not every linear
combination state is a minimum product state. There are special sets of Cn(t) leading to
minimum product states; one such a remarkable set is the coherent state. The squeezed
states described in sec. 4.7 are a more general class of minimum product state78 Coherent and Squeezed States
4.3 Coherent States: Definition, Uncertainty Product
and Physical Meaning
A state |α(t)i satisfying the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation of a system is called a
coherent state of the system if it satisfies the conditions [11]
(i) hα(t)|x|α(t)i = xCM(t), (4.16)
(ii) hα(t)|H|α(t)i = ECM . (4.17)
where ‘CM’ stands for classical mechanics. In the following we show that if the state |αi is
an eigenstate of the annihilation operator a then the condition (i) is satisfied.
4.3.1 Proof of hα|a|αi = α

where α = |α|e

is a complex number, λ is an appropriately chosen number and ECM = |α|

.
The real numbers |α| and θ are the amplitude and phase of α and 0 ≤ |α| < ∞, 0 < θ ≤ 2π.
For the linear harmonic oscillator, from Eq. (4.4), we have x = x0(a + a
†
), x0 = 1/
√
2. As
|ψ(t)i = e−iHt/~
|ψ(0)i (4.19)
and H commutes with a
†a, |α(t)i is written as
|α(t)i = e−ita†a
|α(0)i = e−ita†a
|αi. (4.20)

That is, (∆x)(∆px) = 1/2. Thus, the coherent states are minimum uncertainty states. Note
that this minimum product is identical to the minimum uncertainty product of the ground
state. Further, observe that (∆x)
2 and (∆px)
2
, that is Var(x) and Var(p), are independent
of the average number of quanta in the state and also time. If we do not set m, ~ and ω to
unity then (∆x)
2 = ~/(2mω), (∆px)
2 = ~mω/2 and ∆x∆px = ~/2.
4.3.3 Physical Meaning of Coherent States
Referring to (4.13), a coherent state is mathematically, a linear superposition of the number
states. What is the physical meaning of it? To bring out the physical meaning of it let us
compute the coefficients Cn in the linear superposition given by Eq. (4.13) [12]. Substitution
of (4.13) in a|αi = α|αi gives

Since |Cn|

represents the probability Pn of measuring an energy equal to (n + 1/2) (that
is, n quanta in the system), we write

However, because hni = |α|

, the average energy in |αi is ￾
|α|


.
Equation (4.35) represents Poisson distribution. Experimentally, a single-mode laser light
can be regarded as an approximate coherent light, and is found to have Poisson counting
statistics. Thus, physically a coherent state |αi is a linear combination of number states
with |Cn|
2
representing the probabilities of measuring n quanta in a Poisson distribution
with |α|
2 being the average number of quanta.
4.4 Generation and Properties of Coherent States
In the following we show that coherent states can be generated from ground state with the
help of the displacement operator D(α) [11]. Then we enumerate properties of coherent
states.

Hence, the coherent state given by Eq. (4.20) becomes

|αi = e−ita†aD(α)|0i. (4.48)
Thus, the displacement operator D(α) acting on the vacuum state |0i of the oscillator gen￾erates a coherent state.

of a with eigenvalue α.
We would like to know the time evolution of |αi. This is determined in the following.

This coherent state is
1. a Gaussian wave packet,
2. does not spread out and
3. oscillate in amplitude without change of shape.
Such a state can be regarded as a particle moving in the way of a mass on a spring. On
the other hand, in the theory of radiation, it is the changing electric field strength. These
states represent a standing electromagnetic wave with its amplitude oscillating sinusoidally
in phase through the enclosure.
4.4.5 Generalized Coherent States of Linear
Harmonic Oscillator
We note that the peak of the probability density of the coherent state |α(x, t)i follows
the sinusoidal trajectory of the classical particle. So, the coherent state can be considered
as a displaced ground state. Interestingly, it has been pointed out that the coherent state
can be generalized to include other energy eigenstates [13–14]. That is, we can introduce
generalized coherent states (GCSs) in which any energy eigenstate can also be displaced
with the probability density oscillates similar to classical trajectory.

The choice α = 0 corresponds to the energy eigenstates of linear harmonic oscillator. The
GCSs combine the quantum number containing classical features and the quantum number
containing quantum features. That is, the α part of the GCS behaves that of a coherent
state where as that of a number state is reflected by n part of GCS.
Equation (4.63) gives coherent state for n = 0. For large α, x(t) = |α|
√
2 cos(t − θ) (ω is
chosen as 1) can be viewed as the classical trajectory approximation to the coherent state
at macroscopic energies [15]. Figure 4.1 depicts ||n, αi|2
for n = 0, 1, 2 with α = 2. The
difference between |n, αi and |ni is that [15] the x-dependence of the amplitude of |n, αi
is displaced by the time-dependent hxi while the phase displacement is xhpxi − hxihpxi/2.
Further, the probability density ||n, αi|2
retains the shape of |n, 0i, however, oscillates in
time and follows a classical trajectory.
For |n, αi we can define aα = a − αe

4.4.6 Properties of Coherent States
We now enumerate the properties of coherent states:
1. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator: a|αi = α|αi.
2. They are created from the vacuum state through the unitary displacement oper￾ator: eαa†−α
∗a
|0i = |αi.
3. Coherent states are minimum uncertainty product states, ∆x∆px = ~/2, with
∆x and ∆px equal to those of the vacuum state.
4. Expectation values of x and px are nonzero but are oscillating.
5. hxi lags with hpxi by 90◦ as in a classical oscillator.
6. The oscillation amplitude of average values of x and px are proportional to p
hni
like those amplitudes in a classical system are proportional to √
E.
7. The uncertainties ∆x in x and ∆px in px are equal (=1/2) and independent of
time. Further, ∆x∆px = ~/2.
8. The coherent states obey Poisson distribution.
9. For any complete set |ii, the requirement for completeness is R
|iihi| d
2
i = 1. But
we find R
|αihα| d
2α = π which states that the set |αi is an over complete set.86 Coherent and Squeezed States
10. |ni has a definite number of particles but an uncertain phase. In contrast to this
|αi has an uncertain number of particles but a definite phase.
For further details on coherent states the reader may refer to refs. [1–3].

4.5 Spin Coherent States
A particular quantum state of a spin system which most closely resemble a classical spin is
termed as a spin coherent state [16–19].
Let us consider a spin with a total angular momentum quantum number s. s can be
0,
1
2
, 1, . . . where we set ~ = 1. Denote |smi as the z-angular momentum eigenstates with
m = −s, −s+1, . . . , s. |ssi is the maximal angular momentum state. With the spin operator
S one can easily verify that
Sx|ssi =
s

|s, s − 1i, Sy|ssi = i s
2
1/2
|s, s − 1i, (4.69a)
Sz|ssi = s|ssi, hss|Sx|ssi = hss|Sy|ssi = 0, (4.69b)
hss|Sz|ssi = s, hss|S|ssi = sez, (4.69c)
where ez is the unit vector along the z-direction.
Now, denote s = (s, θ, φ) be a vector of length s and direction (θ, φ) in spherical polar
coordinates. The spin coherent state |si is defined [19] as the state obtained by rotating the
state |ssi by an angle θ about y-axis counterclockwise and then by an angle φ about the
z-axis. |si is given by
|si = |sθφi = eiφSz e
iθSy
|ssi. (4.70)Coherent States of Position-Dependent Mass Systems 87
We find hs|S|si = s. It is to be noted that |si is not an eigenstate of S because S|si 6= s|si.
For a state |ψi one can use the spin coherent state as a basis and define the spin function
(the spin-coherent -state-representation function) as
F(θ, φ) = r
2s + 1
4π
hsθφ|ψi, (4.71)
where p
(2s + 1)/(4π) is the normalization factor. In many ways F behaves like a wave func￾tion. Though a time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for F(θ, φ, t) can be set-up, |F(θ, φ, t)|

is not the probability distribution of outcomes of measuring S.

and W represents the supersymmetric potential. As [A+, A−] depends on x the operators
A+ and A− are not ladder operators. Therefore, introduce new operators whose commutator
does not depend on dynamical variables. For this purpose we consider
A
+(α1)A
−(α1) − A
−(α2)A
+(α2) = R(α1), (4.80)
where α1 = α, α2 = α1 + η and R(α1) is the remainder term. Here
T

(α1)R(αn)T(α1) = R(αn−1), (4.81)
where
T(α1)|φ(α1)i = |φ(α2)i, T(α1)T

(α1) = 1. (4.82)
Next, introduce L±(α1) as
L−(α1) = T
−1
(α1)A
+(α1), L+(α1) = A
−(α1)T(α1). (4.83)
It is easy to verify that [L−(α1), L+(α1)] = R(α0). Further, R(αn)L+(α1) =
L+(α1)R(αn−1). Then the eigenvalues of Hb (Eq. (4.77)) are given by

4.7 Squeezed States
We noticed that for coherent states (∆x)
2 and (∆px)
2 are constant in time. In the follow￾ing we consider a general linear combination state for which these uncertainties oscillate
sinusoidally in time [12].
4.7.1 Definition
A state is said to be squeezed if its oscillating variances (or uncertainties) are smaller than the
variances (or uncertainties) of the ground state. When the minimum value of the product of
the variances become 1/4 then the state is referred to as a minimum uncertainties squeezed
state.
A squeeze operator is defined as
S(r, φ) = S(z) = e(z
∗a
2−za†2
)/2
, (4.89)
where the complex factor z has the form z = re
2iφ
. The real numbers r and φ are called the
squeeze factor and squeeze angle, respectively, of a squeezed state. r and φ are defined as
0 ≤ r < ∞, −π/2 < φ ≤ π/2. A squeezed state is denoted as |α, zi or |βi. It is generated
by acting the displacement operator D(α) on the squeezed vacuum state S(z)|0i:
|βi = D(α)S(z)|0i. (4.90)
Squeezing states are experimentally realized only in special linear combination states
generated by certain nonlinear processes including parametric amplification, four-wave mix￾ing and so on [27–33].
In classical mechanics, the average value of a sinusoidally varying quantity is written as
hxi = 2Re(Ae
−it
). The quantity Ae
−it and A∗
e
it are called classical phasors. When A and
A∗ are treated as input phasors then a general property of a nonlinear device is to produce
a negative and positive frequency output phasors denoted as B and B∗
. B and B∗ are linear
combination of A and A∗
, that is,
B = µA + νA∗
, B∗ = µ
∗A
∗ + ν
∗A , (4.91)
where µ and ν are complex numbers. We can introduce operators to represent B and B∗ as
b = µa + νa†
, b† = µ
∗
a

a , (4.92)
where |µ|

2 = 1. These operators possess certain interesting properties. It is possible to90 Coherent and Squeezed States
set-up eigenfunctions of b by a similar manner used to obtain Eq. (4.36). The eigenfunctions
of b are called squeezed states.
From Eq. (4.92) we write

b = ν

4.7.2 Construction of Squeezed States
If we assume that a squeezed state |βi is an eigenstate of b with eigenvalue β then the
eigenvalue equation is
b|βi = β|βi. (4.95)
Let us choose
|βi =
X∞

Cn|ni. (4.96)
Then Eq. (4.95) using Eq. (4.92) for b, gives
(µa + νa†

Cn|ni = β

That is,

= β(C0|0i + C1|1i + . . .). (4.98b)

For fixed values of µ, ν and β starting with an arbitrary value of C0 the values of the

normalization condition P∞

4.7.3 Expectation Values and Uncertainty Product
Table 4.1 summarizes the expectation values and the variances of x, px and n for both the
coherent and the squeezed states (for the case of β, µ and ν being real). ∆x and ∆px of
squeezed states oscillate with t. (∆x)

The product of the variances also oscillates with time. The state |βi is a Gaussian wave
packet. As it evolves its shape remains Gaussian but the width varies periodically. As ∆x
decreases, ∆px increases and vice-versa. It cannot be treated as a minimum uncertainty
wave packet because ∆x∆px is not always ~/2. However, we can choose the values of β,
µ and ν such that, for part of the oscillatory cycle, (∆x)
2 or (∆px)
2
is less than ~/2 (the
value corresponding to the vacuum state).

The minimum value of (∆x)(∆px) is 1/2 and the state is called a minimum uncertainty
squeezed state. Let us consider the following two cases.
Case 1: t = 0, π, 3π, . . .
From table 4.1 we note that when t = 0, π, 3π, . . . ∆x and ∆px assume their minimum and
maximum values, respectively. They are given by

Case 2: t = π/2, 3π/2, . . .

2
, (4.104b)
∆x∆px =

2
. (4.104c)
In both the cases we observe that ∆x∆px is minimum. However, ∆x and ∆px attains two
extreme values. That is, the product ∆x∆px takes a minimum value 1/2 only at the times
that one variance is minimum whereas the other is maximum. In other words, in a squeezed
state, the quantum variations in one observable are reduced below their value in a minimum
uncertainty state at the expense of increased variations in the conjugate observable so that
the uncertainty relation is not violated. This is a special property of squeezed states. Thus,
the basic hallmark of squeezing is the reduction of quantum variations in the variances
of the observables within the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Recall the corresponding
property of a coherent state. For this state the fluctuations in the variances are equal and
their product is the Heisenberg’s minimum uncertainty relation.
The special property of squeezed state has an important application. In normal radiation
field, as a consequence of the uncertainty principle, we cannot predict with desired accuracy,
for example, both the amplitude and the phase of the electric field. The random variations
restrict them to a certain minimum uncertainty, and as a result the product of the two
is constrained by the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. In a squeezed state, one of these
characteristics can be well known, at the expense of large variances in the other. The
suggestion is to make use of the well known component to perform a measurement of a
physical quantity, which can then be known more accurately than if it were being measured
by a randomly varying field. The detection of gravitation waves is a notable use for squeezed
states. In such a device, squeezed light can be utilized to detect the minute vibrations
generated in a metal bar by a gravitational wave.
4.7.4 Properties of Squeezed States
We summarize some of the characteristic properties of squeezed states.
1. hxi and hpxi are nonzero and oscillating in time.
2. The variances of x and px oscillate in time 180◦ out of phase with one another
with a frequency twice the frequency of the oscillator.
3. At any time, one variance becomes smaller than the square-root of the minimum
uncertainty product.
4. A squeezed wave packet is sharply peaked initially then spread out and comes to
its original state periodically.
5. Like coherent states, squeezed states can be represented by infinite series.
6. Quantum noise is not randomly distributed in phase.Squeezed States 93

That is, the system will return to a sharp state every half period. This points out the
possibility of a stroboscopic measurement, where we can make observations on the oscillator
at time t = 0, π/ν, 2π/ν, . . . so that there is no limitation due to the width of the ground

|βi = U|αi. We have to prove that |βi is an eigenstate of the operator b. Consider U|αi = |βi.
We get hβ| = hα|U
†
. Also,
hβ|b|βi = hα|U
†
bU|αi. (4.107)
Since b = U aU†
, a = U
†
bU we get
hβ|b|βi = hα|a|αi = αhα|αi = α . (4.108)
Hence, |βi is an eigenstate of the operator b. Therefore, U transform the coherent state |αi
into a squeezed state |βi.
4.7.6 Certain Squeezed States
One can define the squeezed-entangled-state (SES) as [34]
|ψSESi = N (|z, 0i + |0, zi), N =
1
√
2

1 + 1
cosh |z|
1/2
. (4.109)
For a large squeezing regime, |z|  1 we have N ≈ 1/
√
2 . The squeezed cat state (SCS) is
defined as [34]
|ψSCSi = N S(z)(|αi + | − αi), N =
1
√
2
√
1 + e−2α2
. (4.110)
Experimentally, the SCSs have been generated [35–36].94 Coherent and Squeezed States
4.8 Deformed Oscillators and Nonlinear
Coherent States
The eigenstates of an operator f(ˆn)a, where f(ˆn) is an operator-valued function of ˆn, are
defined through
f(ˆn)a|α, fi = α|α, fi. (4.111)
The eigenstates |α, fi are called nonlinear coherent states [37–39] and are nonclassical.
These states have been introduced in the study of deformed oscillators whose frequency
depends on its energy.
4.8.1 Deformed Operators
For the harmonic oscillator
a =
1



, a† =
1
√
2



, nˆ = a
†
a, (4.112)
where we have set the mass and ~ as unity, the Hamiltonian H = p
2
x/2 + x
2/2 is expressed
in terms of a and a
† as
H =
1
2
￾
aa† + a
†
a

=

a
†
a +
1
2

. (4.113)
Now, deform the operators a and a
† with an operator-valued function, say, f(ˆn), and define
two operators A and A† as
A = af(ˆn) = f(ˆn + 1)a, A† = f
†
(ˆn)a
† = a
†
f
†
(ˆn + 1). (4.114)
When f is chosen as real and nonnegative then f
† = f. The commutator of A and A†
is
worked out as
[A, A†
] = AA† − A
†A
= af(ˆn)f
†
(ˆn)a
† − f
†
(ˆn)a
†
af(ˆn)
= f(ˆn + 1)aa†

(ˆn + 1) − f
†
(ˆn)nf(ˆn)
= f(ˆn + 1)(a
†
a + 1)f
†
(ˆn + 1) − nf †
(ˆn)f(ˆn)
= (n + 1)f(ˆn + 1)f
†
(ˆn + 1) − nf †
(ˆn)f(ˆn). (4.115a)
Also, we have
AA† + A
†A = (n + 1)f(ˆn + 1)f
†
(ˆn + 1) + nf †
(ˆn)f(ˆn). (4.115b)
Notice that [A, A†
] 6= 1 which means that the transformation from a to A is noncanonical.
In analogy with the Hamiltonian in Eq. (4.113) introduce a Hamiltonian in terms of the
deformed operators A and A† as
HM =
1
2
￾
AA† + A
†A

. (4.116)
The above Hamiltonian was introduced by Man’ko et al [38]. The oscillators represented
by the above Hamiltonian is termed as f-deformed oscillators or simply f-oscillators. TDeformed Oscillators and Nonlinear Coherent States 95
eigenstates of HM are the same as that of the H given by Eq. (4.113). This is because f is
a function of ˆn. The eigenvalues of the above Hamiltonian are
En =
1
2

(n + 1)f(n + 1)f
†
(n + 1) + nf(n)f
†
(n)

. (4.117)
Energy values are nonlinear functions of n. Deformed oscillators are realized as realistic sys￾tems such as matter-radiation interaction and polyatomic molecules. In polyatomic molecule
the potential energy between the atoms has anharmonic terms. We can regard the deformed
oscillators as a kind of anharmonic oscillator and in this sense they are appropriate to de￾scribe the vibrations of polyatomic molecules [40].
4.8.2 Examples of Deformed Oscillators
Consider the classical oscillator with H = (p
2
x + x
2
)/2. In terms of
α =
1
√
2
(x + ipx), α∗ =
1
√
2
(x − ipx) (4.118)
(for which the Poisson bracket {α, α∗} = −i) the above H becomes H = αα∗
. Introduce
two new variables [38]
β =
r
sinh(λαα∗)
αα∗ sinh λ
α, β∗ =
r
sinh(λαα∗)
αα∗ sinh λ
α
∗
. (4.119)
Now, we have
{β, β∗
} = −
iλ
sinh λ
p
1 + |β|
4 sinh λ = −
iλ
sinh λ
q
1 + sinh2
|α|
2 (4.120)
and H = ββ∗
. The equation of motion of β is
β˙ = {β, H} = −
iλ
sinh λ
q
1 + |β|
4 sinh2
λ . (4.121)
Its solution is
β(t) = β(0) exp 
−
iλt
sinh λ
q
1 + |β(0)|
4 sinh2
λ

= β(0) exp 
−
iλt
sinh λ
cosh(λαα∗
)

. (4.122)
Or we write
β(t) = β(0)e−iωt, ω =
λ
sinh λ
cosh(λαα∗
), (4.123)
where ω is the frequency of oscillation of β. The Hamiltonian of this system in terms of α
and α
∗
is
H =
sinh(λαα∗
)
sinh λ
. (4.124)
We note that both the energy and the frequency of oscillation grow with αα∗ due to the
deformation function used. Application of α → a to Eq. (4.119) makes β to be the A given
by Eq. (4.114a) with
f(ˆn) = s
sinh(λnˆ)
sinh(λ)ˆn
. (4.125)
Suppose eλ = q. Then we find that [A, A†
] = q
−a
†a
. The system is called a q-deformed
oscillator .96 Coherent and Squeezed States
4.8.3 Nonlinear Coherent States
We can say that nonlinear coherent states are the eigenstates of the deformed annihilation
operator A:
A|α, fi = α|α, fi. (4.126)
Let us express |α, fi as
|α, fi =
X∞
n=0
Cn|ni, (4.127)
where we have written |nˆi as |ni. To determine Cn, substitute (4.127) in (4.126). Premul￾tiplying by hm| and replace A by af(n) give (verify)
Xhm|f(n)Cn
√
n |n − 1i = α
XCnhm|ni. (4.128)
The above equation yields the recursion relation
Cn+1
√
n + 1 f(n + 1) = αCn . (4.129)
That is,
Cn+1 =
αCn √
n + 1 f(n + 1)
. (4.130)
Replacing n by n − 1 successively gives
Cn =
αCn−1
√
n f(n)
=
α
2
p
Cn−2
n(n − 1) f(n)f(n − 1)
. . . =
α
nC0
√
n! [f(n)]!
. (4.131)
The normalization condition hα, f|α, fi = 1 yields
C0 =
 X∞
n=1
|α|
2n
n! | [f(n) ]!|
2
!−1/2
= Nf,α . (4.132)
In order to have 0 < |Nf,α| < ∞ the requirement is
|α| ≤ limn→∞
n|f(n)|
2
. (4.133)
Similar to the coherent states |αi, two distinct nonlinear coherent states |α, fi and |β, fi
are not orthogonal since
hα, f|β, fi = Nf,αNf,β X∞
n=0

6= 0. (4.134)
It has been shown that in wave guide arrays with certain types of coupling coefficients the
light evolution can be used to obtain classical analogue of nonlinear coherent states [41].
4.8.4 Photon Added Coherent States
Nonlinear coherent states are realized in a trapped ion [39] and in an interaction of a two￾level atom with a cavity field [42].Deformed Oscillators and Nonlinear Coherent States 97
The photon-added coherent states, denoted as |α, mi, given by
|α, mi =
(a
†
)
m|αi
p
hα|am(a
†)m|αi
, (4.135)
where m is a nonnegative integer, is a nonlinear state. These states possess phase squeezing
and sub-Poissonian statistics. These states are realized where two level atom with a ground
state and excited state interacts with a single-mode cavity field. Suppose we define the
operator representing the transition from ground state |gi to the excited state |ei as ˆσ+ and
σˆ− is that of |ei → |gi. If g is the coupling constant then the Hamiltonian of the system is
[42]
Hint = ~g(ˆσ+a + ˆσ−a
†
). (4.136)
For a detailed discussion on |α, −mi and its squeezing features and about photon-added
coherent states one may refer to refs. [43–45].
4.8.5 Certain Other Coherent States
Let us point out some of the coherent states introduced and the connection of them to the
nonlinear coherent states [46]. Klauder, Penson and Sixdeniers (KPS) [47] introduced the
states

|α|

ρ(n)
, (4.137)
where ρ(0) = 1. For KPS states f(n) = p
en/n .
The Gazeau–Klauder (GK) coherent states [48] are defined as
|J, γi = N(J)
−1/2 X∞
n=0
J

e
−ienγ
p
ρ(n)
|ni, N(J) = X∞
n=0
J
n
ρ(n)
, (4.138)
where ρ(0) = 1, J ≥ 0 and −∞ < γ < ∞. In Eq. (4.138a) |ni are the eigenstates of H:
H|ni = En|ni = en|ni, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . (4.139)
where ~ is set unity and ρ(n) = (en)!.
The Penson and Solomon [49] coherent states assume the form
|q, αiPS =

N(q, |α|

n=0

|ni, (4.140)
where 0 ≤ q ≤ 1. It can be shown that for these states f(n) = q
1−n.
Another type of coherent state given by Barut and Girardello [50] is
|α, κiBG = N(|z|

For these states
f(n) = √
n + 2κ − 1, H = n(n + 2κ − 1), n = 0, 1, 2, . . . . (4.142)98 Coherent and Squeezed States
4.9 Concluding Remarks
Coherent states were constructed for many interesting potentials including infinite well and
Poschl-Teller potentials [51] and Morse potential [52,53]. The coherent states of a free par￾ticle [54], a harmonic oscillator with time-dependent frequency [55,56], harmonic oscillator
driven by a periodic external force [57], generalized time-dependent harmonic oscillator
[58], damped and force harmonic oscillator [59], charged particle in a time-dependent elec￾tromagnetic field [60,61] and general potentials [62–64] and graphene [65–67] have been
investigated. For discussion on coherent states of hydrogen atom see ref. [68].
Delayed luminescence of biological systems has been characterized in terms of coherent
states [69]. Coherent states based on quantum key distribution [70], teleportation [71,72],
quantum cryptography [73,74], quantum computation [75,76], secure communication [77]
and characterization of quantum optical processes [78,79] have been investigated. Storage
and transmission [80], cloning [81–83] and generation via cross phase-modulation in a double
electromagnetically induced transparency regime [84] of coherent states were reported.
Squeezed states in a Bose-Einstein condensate [85,86], Jaynes-Cummins model [87],
nanomechanical resonators [88], de Sitter vacuum [89], time-dependent harmonic oscilla￾tor [90], generalized parametric oscillator [91,92] and two mechanical oscillators [93] were
obtained. Use of squeezed states in quantum cryptography [94], quantum distribution of
keys [95,96], extended coherence time [97], quantum engineering [98], teleportation [99],
optics [100,101], detection of gravitational waves [102,103], quantum metrology [104–108]
and laser interferometers [109] have been analyzed. Nonclassical and decoherence properties
[110,111], purification [112] and observation with strong photon-number oscillations [113]
of squeezed states have been discussed.

5.1 Introduction
Consider a quantum mechanical system beginning at a time ti with an eigenstate ψn(x, ti).
Suppose its potential is slowly changing. We assume that ∂H/∂t is very small. Then ac￾cording to adiabatic approximation the wave function ψ of the system is given by
ψ(t) = X

, (5.1)
where
P
an’s are unknown to be determined, En is the energy eigenvalue of nth state and
runs over all possible states. The phase factor −i

is called the dynamical
phase. In adiabatic approximation the initial state ψn(ti) changes into ψn(t, ti) without
combination with other states. Hence, Eq. (5.1) can be written as
ψ(t) = eiη(t,ti) ψn(t) . (5.2)
Usually, the phase factor η(t, ti) is set to zero as only ψψ∗
is measurable. It has been assumed
that η(t, ti) does not give any observable effect.
In 1984 Michael Victor Berry of Bristol University in the U.K. made a very surprising
observation about the evolution of a quantum system in an energy eigenstate under the
action of a Hamiltonian H = H(Ri(t)). Here H is a function of adiabatically (slowly) vary￾ing parameters Ri(t), with period T, representing a circuit C in the parameter space. He
investigated the evolution of the system by adiabatic approximation. Berry got a fascinat￾ing result. After a certain time interval T the system came back to the initial eigenstate.
However, there is a phase factor [1]
e
−i
R tf
ti
En(t) dt

. (5.3)
The first phase in Eq. (5.3) is same as the one in Eq. (5.2). φn(C) gives an additional phase
and is a function of C. That is, this phase factor depends on the path of the circuit. Different
circuits give rise to different phases. Therefore, we cannot adjust it or set it to zero. His
discovery is indeed both deep and beautiful. This phase factor φn(C) is named in his honor
as Berry’s phase. It is also called geometric phase.
Soon after, many generalizations including relaxing the adiabatic conditions and con￾necting it to corresponding classical phenomena, experimental observations and applications
of the Berry’s phase have been reported. Interestingly, a very close analogy to Berry’s phase
had been discovered by Shivaramakrishnan Pancharatnam [2,3] in 1956 at the Raman Re￾search Institute in Bangalore in the topic of polarization of optics. Later, Berry reevaluated
and placed in perspective this pioneering work done in India. Using the ideas proposed by
Pancharatnam, Rajendra Bhandari and Joseph Samuel [4] have shown that a geometric
phase can be defined for noncyclic and nonunitary evolution. Ji et al [5] constructed an

exact wave function of a time-dependent harmonic oscillator using the Heisenberg picture
approach. They examined the wave function for the τ -periodic Hamiltonian and found the
cyclic initial state and the corresponding Berry’s phase. The phenomenon of geometric phase
and its applications have been studied to a remarkably wide range of problems in particle
physics, quantum field theory, condensed matter physics, atomic and nuclear physics.
There are two other quantum effects which have been most widely discussed. The
Aharonov–Bohm effect predicts that a charged particle can be influenced by a magnetic
field even if the particle is not in the region of nonzero field strength. For example, suppose
an electron is sent towards an infinite, perfectly shielded cylinder of radius R, with a ho￾mogeneous field inside, then it would acquire a phase proportional to the magnetic flux. In
1913 Georges Sagnac demonstrated that a beam of light split into two such that one part
travelled clock-wise and the other part counter-clock-wise around a rotating circular ring.
In this chapter, first the derivation of Berry’s phase is presented. This is followed by a
brief discussion on its origin and properties. Next, a classical analogue of Berry’s phase is
brought out. Then, a few examples and effects of the geometric phase are given. A simple
interferometric demonstration of the geometric phase is described. The work of Pancharat￾nam is briefly outlined. The Aharonov–Bohm and Sagnac effects are also discussed in detail.
5.2 Derivation of Berry’s Phase
Let us consider a Hamiltonian H(Ri(t)), i = 1, 2, . . . , k which is a function of a set of
parameters Ri(t) [1,6]. It can be a time-dependent vector field. In this case k = 3 and Ri(t)
are the independent components of the field vector. Assume that the rate of change of Ri(t)
is much slower than ∆En(t) such that the adiabatic approximation is applicable.
The Schr¨odinger equation of the problem is (with ~ = 1 for simplicity)
i
∂ψ
∂t = H(Ri(t))ψ . (5.4)
The solution of the above equation can be written as (refer to exercise 1 at the end of this
chapter)

be a k-component column vector. Defining the nth eigenstate as |n; Ri and noting that
integration is with respect to x, Eq. (5.11) is rewritten as
φ˙
n = ihn; R|∇R|n; Ri · R˙
. (5.13)
So far we noticed nothing new. In fact for a long time the presence of the phase φn in
addition to the phase factor given by Eq. (5.2) has been well known. Generally, it was
assumed that we could eliminate φn by properly redefining the phase of the eigenstates.
However, Berry pointed out if R(tf ) = R(ti) so that |n; R(tf )i interfere with |n; R(ti)i
then such a phase is observable. Integration of Eq. (5.13) from ti to tf gives
φn(t) = i Z tf

hn; R|∇R|n; Ri · dR . (5.14)
The φn(t) given by Eq. (5.14) is called Berry’s phase [1] or geometric phase. φn(t) is an
observable and cannot be eliminated. It has a geometric character and depends on the
history of the quantum system from ti to tf . We define the phase angle φn in terms of an
integral over a vector-valued function as
An(R) = ihn; R|∇R|n; Ri (5.15)
which is called Berry’s vector potential or Berry’s connection [1,6].
In classical physics, an object rotated by an integral number of complete revolutions
about an axis should return to its initial state. The operator for rotation through 2mπ
radians, where m is an integer, is essentially equivalent to the identity operation. Its effect
cannot be observed. But as shown above in quantum mechanics, the wave function of a
system may not come back to its initial phase after its parameters are cycled around a
circuit.

5.3 Origin and Properties of Berry’s Phase
Berry’s phase arises when a system evolves in configuration space. The origin of the phase
can be easily understood by the following illustration given by Levi [7]. Suppose we hold
our arm straight against our side vertically downward and point our thumb in the forward
direction. Lift the arm sideways so that it levels with the shoulder. Next, we rotate the arm
in the forward direction and make it stick straight-out in front of us. Then, we drop the arm
back to our side. Now, our thumb no longer juts out forward but directs in toward our side.
Notice that, our arm has undergone one completion of a trajectory and came back to its
starting point. But the thumb has been rotated about 90◦
relative to its original direction.
There is no local change but a global change has been made.
We can regard our thumb as the state vector of a system that is coupled to a slowly
changing environment which is our arm. If this system changes adiabatically then we ex￾pect that the state vector should return back to its initial state after a cyclic evolution
in parameter space. But it might be multiplied by a phase factor. Part of this phase will
be the dynamic phase arising from the time-dependence of the Hamiltonian. Further, the
phase would be associated with a rotation of the state vector, locally about an axis which
is perpendicular to the surface. The remaining part of the phase factor resulting from the
cycling of our arms is a Berry’s phase.
Some of the properties of Berry’s phase are listed below:
1. The size of the phase is a function of the path taken and sensitive to the features
of its topology.
2. It is nonintegrable and single-valued, that is φ(tf ) 6= φ(ti). Repeated traversals
of a circuit builds-up φ.
3. In electromagnetic theory, the magnetic vector potential A and the magnetic field
B are related as B = ∇ × A and A is given by
A(r2) = µ0
4π
Z
J(r1)
|r2 − r1|
dτ . (5.18)
Here J(r1) is the current density. Now, define a quantity An(R) as
An(R) = ihn; R|∇R|n; Ri . (5.19)
Note that in Eq. (5.19) the right-side is an n-dimensional volume integral. Thereby
comparing Eqs. (5.18) and (5.19) we can regard An(R) as vector potential-like a
quantity. Then, in terms of An(R), Eq. (5.14) is written as
φn =
I
An(R) dR . (5.20)
That is, φn is written in terms of a vector potential-like quantity.
4. The vector potential is arbitrary to the extent that the gradient of some scalar
function Λ can be added. Then B is unchanged by the transformation
A = A0 = A + ∇Λ . (5.21)Classical Analogue of Berry’s Phase 109
The transformation Eq. (5.21) is the well known gauge transformation. Suppose
the phase of the eigenstate is redefined as
|n; Ri → |n; Ri e
iθ(R)
, (5.22)
where θ(R) is an arbitrary phase. Then
An(R) → An(R) + ∇Rθ(R) . (5.23)
Equation (5.23) is analogous to the gauge transformation.
Solved Problem 2:
Show that Berry’s phase satisfies the property that an observable cannot depend on the
choice of gauge.
A line integral can be transformed into a surface integral (by the Stoke’s theorem)
I
B · dl =
Z
S
∇ × B · dS . (5.24)
Using the above, Eq. (5.14) becomes
φn =
I
An(R) · dR =
Z
S
∇R × An(R) · dS . (5.25)
Replacement of An by its gauge (Eq. (5.23)) gives
φn =
Z
S
∇R × [An(R) + ∇Rθ(R)] · dS =
Z
S
∇R × An(R) · dS . (5.26)
φn given by Eqs. (5.25) and (5.26) are the same. Hence, φn does not depend on the choice
of the gauge. Equation (5.26) can be rewritten as
φn =
Z
S
Bn(R) · dS , Bn(R) = ∇R × An(R) . (5.27)
Bn(R) appears as a field-like quantity with φn being the flux of it through the surface.
Bn(R) is called Berry’s curvature and is the Berry’s phase per unit area.
5.4 Classical Analogue of Berry’s Phase
Many classical phenomena have corresponding quantum mechanical analogue. Therefore, it
is natural to identify a classical analogue of Berry’s phase. Is there a classical system which
when taken around a closed path in a parameter space develops a factor similar to Berry’s
phase? Interestingly, rotation by an angle equivalent to Berry’s phase can be realized by
using classical mechanics without referring to quantum mechanics [8]. This is possible when
the adiabatic transformation can be reduced to a coordinate transformation. As an example,
let us consider the classical case of rotation of polarization in twisted optical fibers.
Consider a particle restricted to move on a two-dimensional plane. The potential V =
V (r) is assumed to be cylindrically symmetric. A unit vector S represents the orientation
of the two-dimensional plane. S is perpendicular to the plane. Suppose S is slowly changed110 Berry’s Phase, Aharonov–Bohm and Sagnac Effects
by means of an applied force. The charge is along a closed path and S returns to its initial
value after some time. The time evolution of S is given by

where N and B are normal and binormal unit vectors, respectively. χ and τ are the curvature
and the torsion of a curve, respectively. χ and τ are assumed to be small.
Let us introduce the following two basis vectors
U1 = cos φ N − sin φ B , U2 = sin φ N + cos φ B , (5.29)
and define
dφ

Note that the transformation becomes adiabatic for slowly changing S. Hence, for sufficiently
small χ we can neglect the terms containing χ

in Eq. (5.32). Then Eqs. (5.32) become
u¨i = −dV /dui
, i = 1, 2. This equation is identical to the equation of motion of a particle
of unit mass with S being time-independent. Consider the direction of S. Suppose it is
transformed along a closed curve into itself. Then at the end of the curve U1 and U2 differ
from N and B. They differ by a rotation angle φ. From Eq. (5.30) φ is obtained as
φ =
Z
τ (t) dt . (5.33)
This phase is the classical analogue of Berry’s phase and is called Hannay angle [8].
The Hannay theorem establishes that, if a classical system is taken around a closed path
in parameter space then an angle variable gives a geometric phase. That is, in addition
to the angle predicted in the adiabatic limit by the unperturbed Hamiltonian there exists
another phase shift. This phase shift is (i) independent of the initial conditions of the system
and (ii) the duration of cycle of adiabatic changBerry’s Phase in Solid State Physics 111
5.5 Berry’s Phase in Solid State Physics
Energy spectra of solids display band structures, particularly, in the form of piece-wise
continuous. In each continuous piece the energy is a function of Bloch quasimomentum k
and k varies in the Brillouin zone which can be treated as a parameter space. The Bloch
function ψnk(r) can acquire a Berry’s phase [9]. In the Brillouin zone k can be varied along a
direction and the path is closed when the edge of the zone is reached. For an one-dimensional
solid the Brillouin zone is defined over [−π/a, π/a], where a is the lattice constant and the
edges are at −π/a and π/a. By means of an appropriate perturbation, for example, applied
electric field or magnetic fied k can be allowed to vary through the entire zone. The Berry’s
phase in one-dimension is usually called Zak phase and is used for a better understanding
of electric polarization in dielectrics [10], protected edge states [11,12] and Wannier–Stark
ladders [9,13] and integer quantum Hall effect [14].

(5.34) leads to [9]

Equation (5.39a) provides the Berry’s phase for the nth energy band. γn can also be ex￾pressed in terms of the so-called Wannier function an(x) of a particular band.
For an energy band n its band center is defined as [15]

means of an interference experiment with electrons from the bands n and n
0
it is possible
to measure the difference between γn and γn0 .
5.5.2 Direct Measurement of the Zak Phase
An experimental measurement of Zak phase in a dimerized optical lattice with two sites per
unit cell has been reported [17]. Depending on the parameter values the system can mimic
either conjugated diatomic polymers or polyacetylene. The Hamiltonian of the system is

where h.c. denotes Hermitian conjugate of the preceeding terms, a
†
n and b
†
n are the particle
creation operators for an atom on the sublattice sites an and bn, respectively, in the nth
lattice cell. J and J
0 are the modulated tunnelling amplitudes within the unit cell and ∆
characterizes the energy offset between neighbouring lattice sites.
For ∆ = 0 the system is a polyacetylene and there are two phases denoted as D1 with
J > J0 and D2 with J < J0
. A consequence of the different topological character of the
phases is seen in the difference in their Zak phases: δφZak = π. When ∆ 6= 0 the model is
a linearly conjugated diatomic polymer and in this case the difference of the Zak phases is
fractional in units of π.
Experimental realization of the H given by (5.39) is achieved by loading a BEC of
87Rb into a 1D optical superlattice potential. To form this potential two standing optical
waves of λs = 767 nm and λl = 1534 nm were superimposed leading to a lattice potential
V (x) = Vl sin2
(2klx + φ/2) + Vs sin2
(klx + π/2), kl = 2π/λl
. Switching between φ = 0
and φ = π leads to ∆ = 0 while ∆ 6= 0 for tuning φ away from 0 and π. For ∆ = 0 the
Zak phases are found to be same for the lower and upper bands: φ
D1
Zak = π/2. When the
configuration was changed from D1 to D2 then φ
D2
Zak = −π/2. The difference in the two
phases is δφZak = π.
It has been pointed out that the phase shift consists of geometric phase φZak, dynamical
phase φdyn =
R
(E(t)/~)dt and a phase φZ due to Zeeman energy of the atom in an external
magnetic field. Zak phase was isolated in the experiment using a three step process. For
details see ref. [17]. In [18] an optical system consisting of lattices of circularly curved optical
waveguides has been suggested for observation of Zak phase. In this system photons exhibit
Bloch oscillations in different Bloch bands. For some reports on experimental measurement
of Zak phase one may refer the refs. [19–22Examples and Effects of Berry’s Phase 113
5.6 Examples and Effects of Berry’s Phase
In this section a few examples of physical systems where Berry’s phase is observed and
certain interesting observable effects of Berry’s phase are presented.
5.6.1 Examples of Berry’s Phase
1. The precision of a neutron in a magnetic field
A rotation of spin axis of the neutron through 360◦
results in a phase shift of π.
2. Systems with spins
Phase shifts can be introduced into systems by coupling the spins to a slowly changing
magnetic field. These have been noticed in nuclear-magnetic-resonance interferometry. Op￾tical measurements have detected phase shifts. The phase shifts arise as the orientation of
the light changes through a complete cycle. The geometric phase has been observed in the
spectra of trimers such as Na3.
3. Spin-1 particles
A spin-1 particle can have a phase factor of −1 under some rotations which return to its
initial state classically. For example, the direction of a magnetic field can be rotated slowly
through a cone of apex angle 120◦
in such a way that the magnetic moment of the spin
follows it adiabatically. After the magnetic field has come back to its original direction, the
wave function of the spin acquires a change in its sign relative to that of an identical spin
which has remained in an unchanged magnetic field. This sign change can manifest itself in
the destructive interference between the spins of the two beams.
4. Foucault pendulum
A simple example is the Foucault pendulum, a simple two-dimensional harmonic pen￾dulum with an added Coriolis force. An experimental set-up of this system is available at
Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. The direction of the swing of the pendulum does not
return back to its initial value when the pendulum completes its one-day trip around a
circle of latitude (of Los Angeles). The geometric phase is the solid angle swept out by the
pendulum axis during one revolution of the earth. This is a classical system.
5. System of three hydrogen atoms
Consider a system of three hydrogen atoms. It has two electronic potential energy sur￾faces. They come together at a conical intersection. It represents a configuration where the
three hydrogen atoms essentially form an equilateral triangle. The system distorts when
it moves away from the intersection point. Moreover, the two electronic wave functions
are distinct. For each configuration of the nuclei we can determine the electronic wave
function. Permit the nuclear environment to evolve adiabatically. The reactants reach one
another, interact and retreat. As the nuclear coordinates change slowly the state vector
moves adiabatically over the electronic potential energy surface. If the energy of the system
is sufficiently low then the state moves completely on the lower energy surface. But it ap￾pears that the upper energy surface indeed can influence the reaction through the geometric
phase.114 Berry’s Phase, Aharonov–Bohm and Sagnac Effects
5.6.2 Effects of Berry’s Phase
The presence of a geometric phase gives rise to observable effects in many physical and
chemical systems. Some of the observed effects of geometric phases are pointed out in the
following.
1. In trimers such as Na3, the geometric phase causes the quantum number of an￾gular momentum to be half-integer instead of the expected integer value.
2. In certain chemical reactions the geometric phase leads to observable effects. For
example, in H+H2 →H2+H reaction the total cross-section computed without
geometric phase is different from the experimental result.
3. Geometric phase is used to describe certain classical systems, for example the
kinematics of deformable bodies.
4. The presence of geometric phase indicates that eigenstates of quantum systems
are not single-valued through continuation of parameters in the Hamiltonian.
This is in contrast to the single-valuedness requirement of wave functions under
continuation of position coordinates (why? ).
5. An effective optical activity of a helically wound single-mode optical fiber has
been predicted.
5.7 Applications of Berry’s Phase
The concept of Berry’s phase has been used in the study of quantized Hall effect, the
spin statistics properties of quasiparticle excitations, the rotation of photon polarization in
helical optical fibers, etc. [23,24]. We discuss two applications of Berry’s phase in solid state
physics. The presence of Berry’s phase affects Bloch systems [9,25].
5.7.1 Semiclassical Equations of Motion

electron are [26].

where r is the position of the electron, k is the crystal momentum (or wave vector), (k) is
the band structure (which can be changed by the magnetic field) and F is the total force
on the Bloch electron. The Berry curvature of a Bloch state |ki is defined as [27]
Ω(k) = ih∇kuk| × |∇kuki , (5.43)
where uk is the periodic part of the Bloch function.

k˙
it depends on F. That is, the acceleration in such a system depends on F and also on
|F|

.
5.7.2 Cyclotron Effective Mass
The effective mass of a Bloch electron determined by a cyclotron resonance experiment
is called the cyclotron effective mass m∗
. The presence of Ω(k) affects m∗
. A charged
particle of mass m in a magnetic field exhibits cyclotron motion with an angular frequency
ωc = qB/(mc). For Bloch systems the Bloch electrons with m∗ undergo such a cyclotron
motion. In the presence of the applied field, the Ω(k) prescribe k-space orbits. Writing
F = −(e/c)r˙ × B and then eliminating r˙ from the equations of motion we get

e = 4.8 × 10−10 esu the correction term is ∼ 10−4 and is large enough in experiments [25].
Berry curvature is important for noninversion symmetric materials for which Ω(k) does not
vanish. Even inversion symmetric materials [28] (for example, single-layer graphene) have
displayed the presence of nonzero Berry’s phase.
5.8 Experimental Verification of Berry’s Phase
Experimental observation of Berry’s phase was reported initially by Delacretaz et al. [29].
Then several experimental demonstration of Berry’s phase were done [4,24,30–37] in NMR,
molecular physics, optics and neutron spin rotation. In optics geometric phases were ob￾served with classical light fields [30,36,38] and with single photons [39,40]. For pairs of
identically polarized photons doubling of the geometric phase compared to single photon
experiments was observed [41].
A typical measurement of geometric phase is as follows. The light beam is split into two
channels. One channel is taken as a reference. In the other channel a set of transformations
act. When the beams are recombined the relative phase arises in the interference pattern.
The following is a brief summary of the experiment performed by Bhandari and Samuel
[4,31–33] at Raman Research Institute, Bangalore.
The experimental set-up used to observe Berry’s phase is given in [31–33]. A linearly
polarized beam from a He-Ne laser is split into two beams by a beam splitter. The mea￾surement beam is taken along a cycle of polarization transformations through the following
three components:
1. A quarter-wave plate (QWP1) oriented with its principal axes at 45◦
to the
electric vector in the beam.
2. A half-wave plate (HWP) with its axes oriented at an angle 90◦ + α/2 to that of
QWP1.
3. A linear polarizer LP.
The above cycle of transformations can be represented on the Poincar´e sphere as shown in
Fig. 5.1. These three processes represent the path APBQA. Steps 1, 2 and 3 correspond
to the parts AP, PBQ and QA, respectively. In these processes the beam gets a geometric
phase. Its magnitude is half the solid angle subtended at the center of the sphere by the
area APBQA.
The absolute value of the acquired phase is not easy to determine because it would
be buried in a larger magnitude dynamical phase. However, it is possible to measure the
change in the geometric phase by changing the circuit from APBQA to APCQA. This can
be achieved by rotating the HWP plate about the beam axis through an angle θ. This isPancharatnam’s Work 117

recorded by a laser interferometer system in the experiment. The sign of the phase change
depends upon the direction of rotation of the HWP.
The HWP was rotated into two full rotations in one sense and then two full rotations
in the opposite sense. The phase is found to change with the angle of rotation of the HWP.
Further, the change in the phase is found to continue after a full rotation of the HWP and
moreover returned to the original value after an equivalent amount of reverse rotation. This
is attributed to geometric phase.
5.9 Pancharatnam’s Work
Pancharatnam1
studied the interference patterns produced in plates of an anisotropic crys￾tal [2]. He was concerned with the problem of defining the phase difference between two
beams in different polarization states. He considered the intensity determined by the linear
superposition of the two beams. The intensity varied sinusoidally when the phase of one
beam is varied linearly. The intensity was maximum when the beams were in phase.
A phase shift was noticed when a beam had been taken from one polarization state to
another polarization state, then to a third polarization state, and finally back to its original
state. The magnitude of the phase shift depended on the geometry of the cycle. The above
process was represented on the Poincar´e sphere by Pancharatnam.
The states of polarization are represented as points on the Poincar´e sphere as shown
in Fig. 5.2 [37]. The poles correspond to left- and right-handed circular polarizations with
the rotation by 180◦
in a 360◦
circuit. All other points mark elliptic polarizations. The
polarization attached with any point on the Poincar´e sphere rb is rb · σ, where rb is a unit
vector with polar angles θ and φ and σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices. The important
result of studies of Pancharatnam is that the phase change associated with a circuit C on
the Poincar´e sphere was half of the solid angle subtended at the center of the sphere by C.
1Pancharatnam was a nephew of Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman. When he wrote about polarized
light, he was only 22 years old. In spite of this brilliant beginning, his life ended at the age of 35.118 Berry’s Phase, Aharonov–Bohm and Sagnac Effects

5.10 Cumulants Associated with Geometric Phases
Equation (5.14) gives the Berry’s phase as an integral over a closed curve of the parameters
R. But the most general way to obtain the Berry’s phase is to write it in the discrete
representation as was done originally by Pancharatnam and then to take the continuous
limit. Valentine Bargmann [42] obtained first the discrete Berry’s phase. If we have the
Hamiltonian H(R) depending on the parameters R then for the nth eigenstate |n, Ri we
have the Schr¨odinger equation
H(R)|n, Ri = En(R)|n, Ri. (5.53)
If we consider M points in the parameter space {RI } then we can form the quantity
φn = −I.P.

where |n, RMi = |M, R0i (cyclic). If the points {RI } are points on the closed curve then
taking the continuous limits gives Eq. (5.14).
It has been shown that [43] when the product in Eq. (5.54) associated with an adiabatic
cycle is equated to a cumulant expansion and the continuous limit is taken then a series
of physically well defined quantities result. These quantities are the integrals around the
adiabatic cycle of the parameters. The first-order term gives the Berry’s phase and the
higher-order terms give the associated cumulants.
If we consider a cyclic curve parametrized according to a scalar χ then the product in
Eq. (5.54) is

As can be seen from Eq. (5.14) C1 gives the Berry’s phase. We have already proved
that Berry’s phase is gauge invariant. Cm’s are also gauge invariant [43] and hence they
are physically significant. Further, the cumulants give information about the underlying
probability distribution associated with Berry’s phase [43].
5.11 The Aharonov–Bohm Effect
Apart from the nonlocality displayed by the entangled states of two or many particles
experiment of EPR, quantum mechanics possesses nonlocality for single particle states.
The most notable of this is the Aharonov–Bohm effect [44–48] predicted in 1959 [47] and
confirmed experimentally many times [49–52].

where χ = χ(x, t) is an arbitrary scalar function. This change of the potentials, called
gauge transformation has no effect on a physical result. Thus, in classical mechanics, the
potentials are generally treated as book-keeping devices. They are assumed to have no
physical significance or effects. A particle with no force acts on it will feel no effect. This is
not the case in quantum mechanics. Yakir Aharonov and David Joseph Bohm (1959) [47]
showed that in quantum mechanics there are situations, where the potentials indeed have
physical significance. They predicted that diffraction of charged particles would be affected
by electromagnetic potentials under conditions though the electromagnetic fields are absent.

The changes to the vector and scalar potentials, Eq. (5.61), are accompanied by a change

change the phase of the wave function even when the fields are not present. Nothing of this

5.11.2 Aharonov–Bohm Experiment
The Aharonov–Bohm experiment consists of splitting an electron beam, passing around
both sides of a solenoid and then recombining the beam. This is shown in Fig. 5.3a. An
experimental set-up is depicted in Fig. 5.3b. It essentially consists of a source of charged
particles and a double slit diffraction apparatus. A long solenoid (surrounded by a cylin￾drical shield impenetrable to the charged particles) is kept perpendicular to the plane of
the figure and its position is such that particles cannot reach it. A magnetic field is set
inside the solenoid. Note that the field is zero outside the solenoid. However, there is a
circular potential and it advances the wave front of one electron beam while it retards
the other. When the two beams recombine, there will be a manifestation of a phase-shift
between them. This is known as Aharonov–Bohm effect. The phase-shift depends on the
magnetic flux through the closed path of the electron beams. This can be easily shown as
follows.
Suppose ψ0(x, t) is the solution of the Schr¨odinger equation. Outside the solenoid B =
∇ × A = 0. However, A is not zero everywhere as ∇ × A can be zero with A 6= 0. ForThe Aharonov–Bohm Effect 121

example, if A is a gradient of a scalar function or a constant vector then ∇ × A = 0.
Applying Stokes’ theorem to any path surrounding the cylinder, we obtain
I
A · dx =
Z Z (∇ × A) · dS =
Z Z B · dS = φ . (5.65)
Consequently, if the magnetic flux φ through the cylinder is nonzero then A 6= 0 on every
path that encloses the cylinder. Then according to the gauge transformation we have

The integral in Eq. (5.67) is along a path within the region I. ψ in II can be written in a
form similar to Eq. (5.67).

Here, for Λ1 the integration path is a to b through the region I. For Λ2 it is through
the region II. The interference pattern depends on the relative phase of the two terms in
Eq. (5.68), eiq(Λ1−Λ2)/(~c)
. (Λ1 − Λ2) is the difference between the integrals along paths on
either side of the cylinder. It is equivalent to an integral around a closed path surrounding
the cylinder given by H
A·dx = φ. Therefore, the interference pattern is sensitive to φ inside
of the cylinder, even though the particles do not pass through the region where B 6= 0. That
is, the potential makes a track of the continuity of every happenings throughout space and
more significantly affects the wave function. This is a nonlocal effect.
5.11.3 Experimental Observation of Aharonov–Bohm Effect
In 1962 Bayh [50,53] recorded the Aharonov–Bohm effect on a photographic film. A 40 KV
electron beam was split and recombined by a system of three electrostatic biprisms. A tiny122 Berry’s Phase, Aharonov–Bohm and Sagnac Effects
tungsten coil was inserted (acted as Aharonov–Bohm solenoid) between the first and second
biprism at a place, where the separation of the electron beam was at its maximum. A photo￾graphic film was attached to a small electric motor. The motor advanced the film with a rate
proportional to the rate of increase of current in the coil windings. The film was shielded
except for a 0.5 mm wide slit oriented perpendicular to the interference pattern. There was
a well defined value of magnetic flux through the solenoid. The interference pattern was
recorded on the film. The resulting pattern showed continuous lateral displacement of the
fringes.
Tonomura et al [54,55] constructed small toroidal magnets such that the magnetic field
was practically zero outside them. The magnets were impenetrable [55] and covered by
superconducting layers so that leakage of the magnetic field outside the magnets was for￾bidden. An electron wave packet was sent toward the magnet and then superimposed behind
it with a reference electron wave packet. This resulted in an interference pattern. The ex￾periments were set in a way that the reference electron wave packet was not influenced by
the magnet. Furthermore, the wave packets of electron and the reference electron interfered
behind the magnet alone. The observed interference patterns provided clear evidence of the
Aharonov–Bohm effect.
There is an electric potential equivalent for the Aharonov–Bohm effect. It involves pass￾ing an electron beam through a spatially homogeneous electric potential varying in time.
This can produce a potential but not a force. There is an equivalent effect for a time￾dependent potential. This effect can be produced in a neutron interferometer. In this device
the neutron beam can be split by centimeter and coherently recombined. In one of the
split beams the interaction of the neutron magnetic moment with a magnetic field produces
a homogeneous potential. This in turn, when the beams were recombined, gives rise to a
phase-shift between the two amplitudes. The above effect was observed by Antony Klein’s
and Sam Werner’s groups.
5.11.4 Features of Aharonov–Bohm Effect
We list some of the features of the Aharonov–Bohm effect.
1. The Aharonov–Bohm effect is a topological effect. That is, the effect depends on
the flux encircled by the paths of the particle but the paths never approach the
region of the flux.
2. The effect depends on the dimensionless ratio qφ/~c. If the charge of the particle
is zero then no effect occurs. This is verified experimentally using neutrons.
3. The particle never enters the region in which B 6= 0. Therefore, the trajectory
cannot be deflected by the magnetic field inside the cylinder. In quantum mechan￾ics this is true on the average. The ensemble average rate of change of velocity of
the particle is
Ddv
dt
E
=
1
2
 q
mc

hψ|v × B − B × v|ψi . (5.69)
Since ψ(x) 6= 0 if B 6= 0 and B(x) = 0 if ψ(x) = 0 we have hdv/dti = 0. The flux
φ affects the motion of individual particles but the net deflection is zero.
4. The positions of the fringes pattern shift as φ is varied. Their intensities also
change so that the centroid of the pattern remains the same.
5. If the flux φ were quantized in multiples of 2π~c/q then the phase factor eiqc/(~c)
is 1. Then there would be no observable dependence of the interference pattern on
φ. That is, in Aharonov–Bohm effect φ is not quantized. Note that it is quantized
in superconductivity.Sagnac Effect 123
For more discussion on the Aharonov–Bohm effect one may refer to ref. [56].
5.11.5 Aharonov–Bohm Effect in Quantum Electrodynamics
In this section we present the possibility of occurrence of quantum electrodynamic
Aharonov–Bohm effect wherein a charge interacts with a potential arising due to a quantized
electromagnetic field with no overlapping of field with the charge [57].
We consider a system where a superconducting charge qubit is located at the middle of
a ring-shaped cavity with a node. The qubit state can be formed by means of Josephson
junction tunnelling with superconducting reservoir. In this set-up the electromagnetic field
not directly overlaps the qubit. Denote the Hamiltonians of the qubit, the single mode cavity
and their interaction as Hq, Hc and Hint, respectively. The Hamiltonian of the system is
H = Hq + Hc + Hint. (5.70)
In diagonalized form [57] Hq is
Hq = Eg|gihg| + Ee|eihe|, (5.71a)
where
|gi = cos(γ/2)|0i + sin(γ/2)|1i, (5.71b)
|ei = − sin(γ/2)|0i + cos(γ/2)|1i, (5.71c)

where qb = 2e|1ih1i = e sin γ(σ+ + σ−) with σ+ = |eihgi and σ− = |gihe|.
The scalar potential at the location of qubit denoted as V (t) is obtained as [57] V (t) =
V1(t)+V2(t), where V1(t) is the contribution from the surface charges of the inner conductor
of the cavity and V2(t) is from that of the outer conductor. They are

The point is that the cavity field and the non-overlapping qubit interact. The amplitude of
interaction is qV0/2. This is the manifestation of the Aharonov–Bohm effect for a quantum
electrodynamic potential. This interaction leads to Stark and Lamb shifts and vacuum

5.12 Sagnac Effect
Generally, a fully Galilean invariant theory, (that is, for the comoving observer all physically
relevant parameters are the same as for a corresponding observer in rest) will not predi124 Berry’s Phase, Aharonov–Bohm and Sagnac Effects
an observable effect of the rotation. One may think that nonrelativistic quantum mechanics
is a Galilean invariant theory, that is it is independent of relativistic consideration. But the
way in which the phase of the wave function transforms is incompatible with the behaviour
of classical waves under Galilei transformations. Consequently, the Schr¨odinger wave me￾chanics can make predictions that have a relativistic character and cannot be expected from
a Galilean invariant theory.
5.12.1 The Transformation of the Phase
The phase of a wave at a point with coordinate x at time t is given by φ = (pxx − Et)/~ =
(m/~)(vx − v
2
t/2). Here v is the velocity of the particle. Consider a Galilean frame (x
0
, t0
)
moving with a velocity −u with respect to the frame (x, t) then x
0 = x+ut, t
0 = t, v
0 = v+u.

Thus, if ψ(x, t) is a solution of the Schr¨odinger equation in the inertial frame (x, t) then
that of the Schr¨odinger equation in (x

5.12.2 Galilean Invariance
The transformation of the wave function given by Eq. (5.77) corresponds to a (projective)
representation of the group of Galilei transformations. Moreover, the Schr¨odinger equation is
invariant under the transformations. The momentum transformation is from px to px +mu.
The fulfilment of the above two conditions is sufficient to argue that the Schr¨odinger theory is
Galilean invariant. This means that the only effect on the wave functions is multiplication by
a phase factor. However, the detection probabilities phenomena remain the same irrespective
of the choice of the frame used for prediction. But this argument is inconsistent with the
Sagnac effect discussed below.
5.12.3 Sagnac Effect
Consider a disk made to rotate around its center. A device on the disk emits two signals
of same kind simultaneously. The signals travel with same velocity in opposite directions.
Further, they are allowed to travel along the same circular path with the center in the
middle of the disk. The signals are detected and compared once they come to the point of
emission. Now, the question is: Will the rotation of the disk influence the measurement of
the detector?
From Galilean invariance it is to be noted that a comoving observer on the disk would
observe the departure of both the signals with the same speed. The time taken for theSagnac Effect 125
signals to meet at the point of emission after one complete revolution is 2πR/v, where R
and v are the radius of the circular plate and the speed of the signals, respectively. There
is no effect on both the arrival time and the phase relation of the signals due to rotation.
What will happen if we include the relativistic effect? In the case of the relativistic ver￾sion, the observer of the rotating disk would see the departure of the signals with oppositely
directed speeds namely v
0 and −v, in their respective momentary inertial frames. If x and
t are the coordinates of a momentary inertial frame moving along with a segment of the
moving disk then for the comoving observer at the position of the detector we have

The appearance of
1. a difference in arrival times and
2. an associated phase difference
when the total system is in rotation is called the Sagnac effect [58–60]. The origin of the
effect is completely relativistic.
The Sagnac effect was verified experimentally. The phase-shift in the interference of two
coherent light beams manifesting due to the rotation of the apparatus was first observed by
Georges Sagnac in 1913 [58] and then by Albert Abraham Michelson and Henry G. Gale in
1925 [60]. The same effect in the interference of neutron beams due to the rotation of earth
has also been observed [61]. The Sagnac effect is used, for example, in inertial guidance
systems and global navigation systems. This effect is utilized in many applications related
to the measurement of rotation rates. In the Global Positioning System (GPS), a Sagnac
correction has to be taken into account because a rotating clock (on board a satellite)
experiences loss of synchronization at each turn with itself.126 Berry’s Phase, Aharonov–Bohm and Sagnac Effects
5.12.4 The Quantum Sagnac Effect
In quantum theory, two particles with opposite velocities can be represented by wave packets
with opposite group velocities. Because the velocities transform as per a Galilei transforma￾tion the rotation of the disk gives no effect on the time needed by the wave packets to reach
the detector. However, for the phases there is a difference. The point is that the observer
of the disk should not carry out the calculations using φ = (pxx − Et)/~ but should take
into account of the correction term m(ux0 − u
2
t/2)/~. The phase difference at the detector
is given by
∆φ =

. (5.83)
Thus, in addition to the relativistic correction factor 1/
p
1 − ω2R2/c2, the phase-shift ∆φ
given by Eq. (5.82) is expected on the relativistic theory.
Interestingly, the phase-shift gives an observable effect. Suppose ψ1 and ψ2 are the wave
packets without rotation of the disk. Then, when the disk is made to rotate the total wave
function at the detector is N(ψ1e
iφ1 + ψ2e
iφ2 ) with N being a normalization constant. As
a result, the probability to detect a particle is ∝ |ψ1|
2 + |ψ2|
2 + 2Re[ψ1ψ
∗
2
e
i(φ1−φ2)
]. The
Sagnac phase-shift is consequently reflected in the counting of particles in the detector. The
effect has been verified experimentally in neutron interferometry, where the rotation of the
earth has been proved detectable in this way [58].
5.13 Concluding Remarks
It has been shown that in two vertically coupled InGaAs/GaAs quantum dots Berry’s
phase can be changed from 0 to 2π or 2π to 0 by applying an external bias voltage [62]. A
method was proposed for detecting spin-entangled electrons using Berry’s phase [63]. It is
possible to observe geometric phase with polarization changes, where the initial and final
states are different. This kind of polarization is called noncyclic and represented by non￾closed paths on the Poincar´e sphere. Both theoretically and experimentally the phase on
the optical elements is found to depend on a linear or nonlinear or on a singular way [64].
Berry’s phase has a significant role in the tunnelling of nano magnetic clusters. For a cluster
with a half-integer degenerate spin states tunnelling between two states is suppressed by
the Berry’s phase resulting from the destructive interference of different tunnelling paths
[65,66]. Detection of Berry’s phase in graphene [67], semiconductors [68] and in anisotropic
insulators [69] have been reported.
Berry’s phase is found to effect the center of the line for hydrogenic emitters in plas￾mas [70]. For a review on the effects of Berry’s phase on electronic properties see ref. [71].
Progress on Berry’s phase optical elements has been presented [72]. Broadband THz emitters
based on Berry’s phase nonlinear metasurfaces exhibiting unique optical functions was ex￾perimentally realized [73]. In quantum field theory we can consider Berry’s phase of various
states associated with the adiabatic variation of parameters such as masses and coupling.
For some details of Berry’s phase in quantum field theory see the refs. [74,75].
The role of tunnelling and associated forces on the Aharonov–Bohm effect has been
reported [76]. The Aharonov–Bohm effect was explained without using the potentials but
treating the source of the potentials in the framework of quantum theory [77]. The Sagnac
effect has been studied in resonant microcavities [78] and light propagation in a wave guide

6.1 Introduction
Given the wave function ψ(x, t) we compute the probability density function ρ(x, t) =
|ψ(x, t)|
2 and easily visualize the distribution. Knowing ψ(x, t) the distribution in momen￾tum px is given by

, (6.1)
where χ(px, t) is the momentum wave function. The momentum distribution is difficult to
visualize from the given ψ(x, t). Thus, we wish to have a function that can display the
probability distribution in the variables x and px simultaneously. Recall that, in classical
mechanics phase space is used to visualize the solutions of systems. For quantum mechanical
systems Eugene Paul Wigner introduced a quantum analogue of a phase space probability
distribution called Wigner distribution function or phase space picture [1–8]. The idea is
that every state of a quantum system is describable by a distribution (or function) on
the classical phase space. In the phase space picture, starting from the Schr¨odinger wave
function, we are able to construct the Wigner distribution function in terms of x and px.
It does not represent a joint probability distribution for x and px because the uncertainty
principle disallows the simultaneous determination of these variables with desired accuracy.
Using the Wigner distribution function [1,2] it is possible to perform a canonical trans￾formation in quantum mechanics. The phase space picture is a useful candidate to illustrate
the transition from classical to quantum mechanics. We note that classical mechanics deals
with trajectories in phase space. In contrast to this quantum mechanics is concerned with
probabilities. If it is desired to compare the classical mechanics and quantum mechanics, we
need to focus on ensembles of trajectories in phase space for the classical case while density
distribution in x and px (or Wigner function) for the quantum case.
The phase space approach finds applications in modern optics. In quantum optics, co￾herent state is represented by the circles and squeezed states by ellipses. They are generally
in the two-dimensional phase space. In the Schr¨odinger representation, the position and mo￾mentum operators are represented by noncommuting operators and consequently the phase
space concept is incompatible with this representation. However, in the Wigner phase space
representation the circles and ellipses are defined in a very compact manner. In this chapter
we present some of the features of the phase space picture.

6.2 Squeeze and Rotation in Phase Space
Let us first define the term squeeze [9] in phase space. For this purpose consider a circle
centered about the origin in x and px coordinate system. Suppose we elongate the x-axis
by multiplying it by a real number > 1 and contract the px-axis by dividing it by the
same number. This circle is transformed into an ellipse. However, the areas of both are the
same. This is a squeezing process. Squeezing can be performed in an arbitrary direction by
combining the above operation with rotation about the origin.
In the above squeezing process, the x and px are changed, essentially, underwent trans￾lations. The coordinate transformation representing it is
x
0 = x + 0 · px + u , p0
x = 0 · x + px + v. (6.2a)
In matrix form the translation matrix T(u, v) is given by
T(u, v) =


x
0
p
0
x
1

 =


1 0 u
0 1 v
0 0 1




x
px
1

 . (6.3)
If u and v are set to zero then Eq. (6.3) is a linear homogeneous transformation. An example
of linear transformation is the rotation around the origin through an angle θ/2:
R(θ/2) =


x
0
p
0
x
1

 =


cos(θ/2) − sin(θ/2) 0
sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) 0
0 0 1




x
px
1

 . (6.4)
(When does the order of the matrix R(θ/2) become 2 × 2?) Another example is the squeeze
along the x-axis. Here, the circle is deformed into the ellipse and the elongation is along the
x-axis. Now, x becomes eλ/2x while px → e
−λ/2px, where λ is the deformation parameter.
The matrix form of squeezing is [9]
Sx(λ) =


x
0
p
0
x
1

 =


e
λ/2 0 0
0 e−λ/2 0
0 0 1




x
px
1

 . (6.5)
Observe that the elongation along the x-axis is necessarily accompanied by the contraction
along the px-axis. Sx(λ) deforms the circle into ellipse with e−λx
2 + eλp
2
x = 1. We know
that a canonical transformation followed by another one is also a canonical transformation.
As a consequence, an appropriate form of the transformation matrix can be a product of
matrices T, R and Sx representing translation, rotation and squeezes, respectively. Let us
simplify this by making use of the generators of the transformation matrices.
Solved Problem 1:
Consider a circle described by (x − a)
2 + (px − b)
2 = 1 which is not centered about the
origin. Determine the effect of the squeezing along the direction that gives an angle θ/2
with the x-axis with the deformation parameter η.
With the applied squeeze the given circle becomes a tilted ellipse with

6.2.1 Generators of the Transformation Matrices
For the translation matrix T(u, v) of Eq. (6.3) the generator is
T(u, v) = e−i(uN1+vN2)
, N1 =


0 0 i


 , N2 =


Next, the rotation matrix R(θ/2) is written as
R(θ/2) = e−iθL , L =



i/2 0 0



Sx = e−iλK1
, K1 =


i/2 0 0
0 −i/2 0
0 0 0


The matrix generating the squeeze in the direction making π/4 with x-axis is
K2 =


0 i/2 0

0 0 0


Solved Problem 2:
Show that the coordinate transformation operator T(a) = e−iapx/~
corresponds to a spatial
translation and find the generators for coordinate translation.
We know that [x, f(px)] = i~∂f /∂px. Therefore, [x, T(a)] = i~∂T(a)/∂px = aT(a). That is,
xT(a) = T(a)x + aT(a) = T(a)(x + a) . (6.12)

corresponds to a spatial translation. For an infinitesimal transformation, a → δa → 0,
T(a) ≈ 1 − iδapx/~. Comparing it with the equation xT(a) = T(a)(x + a) the generators
for translation transformation along x-direction is given by N1 = px/~ = −i∂/∂x.134 Phase Space Picture and Canonical Transformations
6.2.2 Commutation Relations of N1, N2, L, K1 and K2

6.3 Linear Canonical Transformations
For a function that is real and defined in the phase space of x and px we can do area￾preserving canonical transformations [6]. An example of such a function is the Wigner
probability distribution to be considered in the next section. First consider linear canonical
transformations applicable to a function of x and px. How do we obtain them? This is
achieved converting the matrix generators considered in the previous section into differential
forms.
When a unitary operator U(α1, α2, . . . , αr) performs an infinitesimal transformation as￾sociated with a Lie group, then U = 1 − i
Pr
l=1 δαlGl
, where the operators Gl are called
generators of the Lie group. For the spatial translation group, the generators are the com￾ponents of the momentum operator. In the case of the three rotational translational group,
the components of the angular momentum are the generators. When the translation is in
momentum space then the operators of the position coordinates are the required generators.
The generators of translations in x and px space and rotation about the z-axis are [6]
N1 = −i

. (6.16)
The operators in Eqs. (6.15)-(6.16) obey the commutation relations, Eqs. (6.14). Therefore,
we use the matrix formalism of classical mechanics considered in the previous section in the
phase space picture of quantum mechanics.
The Poisson brackets and canonical transformations are part of the effective formula￾tion of classical mechanics. In quantum mechanics the Poisson bracket becomes commutator.
We ask: Why are canonical transformations not discussed for example, in the Schro¨dinger
picture? This is because in phase space, the translation operators x and px do not com￾mute with each other. Further, the wave function is a function of x or px and not both.
In fact, the following transformations on ψ(x, t) lead to the transformations [9] given inWigner Function 135
Eq. (6.15)–(6.16):

These operators are all Hermitian in the Schr¨odinger picture. However, the question is
whether they satisfy the commutation relations (6.14). They satisfy all the commutation
relations except one. For Nb1 and Nb2 (and N1 and N2)
h
Nb1, Nb2
i
= −i while [N1, N2] = 0 . (6.18)
N1 and N2 commute with each other whereas Nb1 and Nb2 do not. h
Nb1, Nb2
i
= −i causes
a factor of modulus unity when the translation along px is commuted with that along the
x-direction. The point is that the set of linear canonical transformations in the Schr¨odinger
picture is not the same as that in classical theory. Further, N1, N2 and L form the two￾dimensional Euclidean group. On the other hand, Nb1, Nb2 and Lb require the identity operator
to form a group.
6.4 Wigner Function
In this section we introduce the Wigner function, point out the properties of it and work it
for two quantum systems.

This distribution function is defined over the two-dimensional phase space of x and px
and is called phase space distribution function or Wigner distribution function or simply
Wigner function. Eugene Wigner introduced this function in the early 1930s in the study of
quantum corrections. The Wigner function is seen as the Fourier transform of the product of
the shifted ψ and its complex conjugate ψ
∗
. It is a real function of x and px. Since W(x, px)
has a one-to-one correspondence with ψx, it completely represents a quantum state. It is
meaningful to regard W as a probability distribution function in the phase space with the
coordinates x and px.136 Phase Space Picture and Canonical Transformations
6.4.2 Properties of Wigner Function
The integrand in Eq. (6.20) measures the correlation between ψ and ψ
∗
in a Fourier space.
The Wigner function has several remarkable properties that are summarized below:
1. W = W∗
(verify). W is pure real and may be positive or negative. It is not
a probability distribution function because it may take on both positive and
negative values.
2. Knowing W the positive probability distribution function in the (x, px) coordi￾nates are given by
PQM(x, t) = |ψ(x, t)|
2

W(x, px, t)dx, (6.21b)
where χ is the momentum wave function. Integration over px gives the position
distribution |ψ(x)|
2
. On the other hand, integration over x yields the momentum
distribution |χ(px)|
2
. Interestingly, W encodes both coordinate space probability
and momentum space probability in a state represented by ψ.
3. The absolute square of the inner product of two wave functions ψ(x, t) and φ(x, t)
is given by

|(φ, ψ)|

is positive but becomes zero when ψ and φ are orthogonal.
4. Conventional representations give information about either position or momen￾tum. In contrast, the Wigner representation gives details about both position and
momentum.
5. From Eq. (6.20) the following translation property is evident. When ψ(x, t) →
ψ(x−α, t) then W(x, px, t) → W(x−α, px, t): a shift in ψ introduces a correspond￾ing shift in W. If ψ(x, t) → ψ(x, t)eiαx then W(x, px, t) becomes W(x, px − α, t).
A shift in momentum wave function gives a corresponding shift in px of W.
6. How do we find the wave function from the Wigner function? Given W(x, px, t)
we compute ψ(x, t) through a two-step process:
(a) Find the Fourier transform W of W:
W(x, s, t) = 1

The choice x = x0, s = 0 yields W(x0, 0, t) = (1/π)ψ

turn gives
ψ
∗
(x0, t) = πW(x0, 0, t)
ψ(x0, t)
. (6.26)

The noteworthy observation is that W is pure real while ψ is generally com￾plex. Thus, from the real function W it is possible to compute a complex
function ψ.
7. We write W =

(x)ψ2(x)ds. Then |W| ≤ 1/π and hence W cannot take
arbitrarily large values.
8. For identical particles, if ψ is either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to
the exchange of x
0
s and px’s then W is symmetric:
W(x1, px1
, x2, px2
) = W(x2, px2
, x1, px1
). (6.28)
For a system with N states ψ is represented by N complex numbers (2N real
numbers) with an overall phase ambiguity. For this same system W needs N2
real numbers.
9. The Wigner function is useful when the process of extracting desired information
from it is easier than obtaining from ψ. For example, from the property (3) the
momentum density is computed from W by an integration of it over position.
Whereas the momentum density is computed from ψ through the square of a
Fourier transform. Several problems, particularly in quantum optics, are in this
category [10,11].
10. Is it possible to measure W(x, px) of a quantum mechanical particle? Because the
probability distribution of an observable corresponds to an integral over W(x, px),
a single measurement cannot yield localized values of W(x, px). We consider an
observable whose average value is proportional to W(x, px). We can perform
a large number of repeated measurements on that observable by preparing a
particle in the same quantum state. Then it is possible to construct the Wigner
distribution by averaging the observable [10,12,13].

where u = x for 0 ≤ x ≤ L/2. For the interval L/2 ≤ x ≤ L in the above x and u are to be
replaced by L − x. Figure 6.2 presents three examples of the Wigner function for n = 1, 5
and 10 with L = 1. For clarity W > 0 alone is shown in Fig. 6.2. W is almost everywhere
positive for n = 1. For n  1 (as shown for n = 5 and 10) the patterns are surprising.
We can clearly observe the triangular form of the fin-shaped pattern along px = ±pn
axes. There are spines along the px = 0 axes. Both these structures are features of the
system.

We use the Schr¨odinger equation to determine ψ(x, t) from a given ψ(x, 0). Then obtain
W(x, px, t) by solving Eqs. (6.34a) and (6.38). Notably, ψ and W obtained for given initial
conditions are indeed unique because the Schr¨odinger equation and Eqs. (6.34a) and (6.38)
are linear and first-order in time t. Because Eqs. (6.34a) and (6.38) are obtained from
Schr¨odinger equation these solutions have the one-to-one relations.

The above equation, neglecting the terms containing ~

, is the
classical Liouville equation. The motion of W in phase space is that of classical case under
the influence of V (x). When we add higher derivatives of V then they give rise to a diffusion￾like dynamics.142 Phase Space Picture and Canonical Transformations
For the harmonic oscillator with V (x) = kx2/2, the Eq. (6.39) becomes

∂t = −px

. (6.40)
It is the classical Liouville equation for the linear harmonic oscillator. Hence, the W of the
harmonic oscillator obeys the classical Liouville equation, even if the state is not nearly
classical (~ not → 0).
6.6 Applications
The phase space picture of quantum mechanics became a research tool in modern optics.
Coherent and squeezed states [2] and uncertainty relation for the spreading wave packet
[3] are described more precisely in this picture. The canonical transformations in the phase
space representation is a very vital theoretical tool in many branches of physics [1,4–6],
particularly, to study Lorentz transformations while applying canonical transformations in
phase space that correspond to processes in optics laboratories [3]. In the infinite height
potential video sequences [24] of the evolution of Wigner functions for a wave function of
a wave packet and its mirror wave packet is constructed. This and other related studies
explored the fascinating patterns called quantum carpets [25–30] (patterns in space-time
density plot) of probability density |ψ(x, t)|
2
. W is exploited to study entanglement of cor￾related systems and the phase space sub-Planck structures of quantum interference [31,32].
Wigner functions have been reconstructed experimentally for quantum states of light, vibra￾tional modes of molecules and superposition of diffracted cold atoms by a double slit [12].
A method to compute W for hydrogen atom has been developed [33]. A discrete Wigner
function based on mutually unbiased bases has been defined [34–36] and it received great
interest and has been used in a wide range of problems [37–40].
It is possible to write a light field as a Wigner distribution blurred by a kernel that can be
reduced to a delta function at the geometric optics limit. This demonstrates the equivalence
between the Wigner distribution and light field at that limit. In signal processing studies,
the Wigner distribution is seen as a distribution on position and frequency of a signal.
In this section we present the application of the canonical transformations and phase
space distribution function in the study of wave packet spread and coherent and squeezed
states.

(a) W given by (6.46) at t = 0. (b) W at a time t.
Consider the W(x, px, t) given by Eq. (6.46). It is a circle at t = 0 (Fig. 6.4). As
time increases, the circle deforms a tilted ellipse preserving its area. The distribution is
concentrated in the region where the exponent becomes < 1 in magnitude. This region is
the region of uncertainty and is called error box . What do we infer from the area-preserving
property? In the Schr¨odinger picture as time advances, the spatial distribution ρ(x) or ∆x
becomes widespread. This is called the wave packet spread. On the other hand, in the phase
space picture of quantum mechanics, the uncertainty is defined in terms of the volume of
the error box that is invariant. Many of the results would be difficult to obtain from the
Schr¨odinger equation. Thus, a deeper understanding is achieved about the wave packet
spread.

6.6.2 Linear Harmonic Oscillator
For the linear harmonic oscillator the classical motion in x, px space is
x0 = x cos ωt −
1
ω
px sin ωt , px0 = px cos ωt + ωx sin ωt , (6.48)
where x0 and px0 are the values of x and px at t = 0. Thus, if the Wigner function W(x, px, 0)
corresponds to t = 0 then at t > 0
W(x, px, t) = W

It is noteworthy to mention that for the harmonic oscillator the analysis with exponentials
and Hermite polynomials is concerned with the quantum state which can be prepared. It
has nothing to do with the physics of the time development of initial state [23].Applications 145
6.6.3 Coherent and Squeezed States
It is straight-forward to evaluate the Wigner function for the coherent state of the harmonic
oscillator given by

W(x, px) = 1

. (6.51)
This function is concentrated in a circular region governed by the equation
(x − a)
2 + (px − b)
2 = 1 . (6.52)
The Wigner function moves around its path in phase space, whereas its projection on the
x-axis moves back and forth without an unchanging profile. If α = 0, then a = b = 0 and
hence the above circle becomes centered around the origin x
2 + p
2
x = 1. This is the vacuum
(zero photon) state. Therefore, the study of the Wigner function for the harmonic oscillator
is equivalent to the study of a circle. The canonical transformation consists of translations,
rotation and area-preserving elliptic deformations of this circle. These transformations are
straight-forward under the translation along the x-axis by an amount a. In this case the
circle becomes (x − a)
2 + p
2
x = 1 with the centre (a, 0). That is, the coherent state has a
Gaussian distribution in phase space and it can be represented by a circle.
If we multiply α by eiθ/2
, the circle given by Eq. (6.52) becomes rotated around the
origin so that
(x − a

Figure 6.5 depicts coherent and squeezed states in Wigner phase space. Here b is chosen
as zero. The circle around the origin in Fig. 6.5a represents the ground state harmonic
oscillator. The one about (a, 0) corresponds to coherent state. This circle can be elongated
along the x-direction. The resulting ellipse is for the squeezed state with a real parameter
(a 6= 0, b = 0) (Fig. 6.5b). This ellipse can be rotated through an angle θ/2 (Fig. 6.5c). This
rotated ellipse corresponds to the squeezed state with a complex parameter (a 6= 0, b 6= 0).
A squeezed state has a Gaussian distribution in phase space like the coherent state. Unlike
the case of coherent states the distribution for a squeezed state is elliptic. The circle in phase
space for the coherent state is linearly deformed in such a way that the area is preserved.146 Phase Space Picture and Canonical Transformations

6.7 Advantages of the Wigner Function
The Wigner function has the following advantages in quantum optics.
1. Both the position and momentum variables are C numbers (real and complex
numbers) in this representation. The W for the coherent and squeezed states is
a Gaussian function of these C number variables. This Gaussian form can be
described by circles and ellipses in phase space.
2. Canonical transformations can be performed on the Gaussian form of the dis￾tribution function which makes the mathematics simpler. For example, in the
Schr¨odinger picture the uncertainty product for a squeezed state is not always
minimal. But it is always minimal in the Wigner representation.
3. It is possible to calculate the expectation values and transition probabilities di￾rectly from W [2]. Due to the symmetry properties in phase space the calculations
are simpler than in the Schr¨odinger representation.
4. The basic advantage of the Wigner function is that the translation operators
commute with each other in phase space whereas the translation operators x and
px in the Schr¨odinger representation do not commute with each other.Concluding Remarks 147
6.8 Concluding Remarks
Wigner distribution has been constructed for a time-dependent quadratic Hamiltonian sys￾tem [41] and certain position-dependent mass systems [42]. The Wigner function has been
used in quantum optics to explain the partial coherence associated with radioactivity [43].
It is used to bridge the gap between simple ray tracing and the full wave analysis of the
system in the modelling of optical systems such as telescopes or fiber telecommunications
devices. In signal analysis it has been used to represent a time-varying electrical signal,
mechanical vibration, or sound wave. For the purposes of musical synthesis deriving from
timbre morphing, the increased accuracy of the Wigner distribution representation will al￾low more accurate extraction of those features which characterize musical timbre [44]. The
open-system Wigner function approach has proved to be of use in understanding the be￾haviour of resonant-tunnelling diodes. This technique permits evaluation of steady-state
behaviour in the form of the curve, and calculations of the large-signal transient response
and small-signal ac response [45]. It was shown that the Wigner domain may provide a
better understanding of the sampling process than the traditional Fourier domain [46].
In quantum mechanics, linear combinations of wave functions ψ(x, t) that satisfy the
Schr¨odinger equation are also the solutions of it. When the transformation is made to
the corresponding Wigner functions and the x − px space, this linearity is lost. This is
demonstrated for nonlinear Duffing oscillator as a classical system and as a quantum system
has been presented [47]. It has been pointed out that the distinction between classical and
quantum is not simply the distinction between large and small, but the extent to which
we know the distribution [23]. If we pin down the distribution in phase space, either due
to the details of preparation, details of evolution, or fineness of measurement, to details
approaching ∆x∆px ≈ ~, the quantum nature will emerge.
Monte Carlo simulation study of resonant tunnelling diode operation [48] and nonequi￾librium electron transport [49] have been analyzed through Wigner function approach. Tun￾nelling in deca-nanometer MOSFET was studied using Monte Carlo method for the Wigner
transport equation [50]. For recent developments on Wigner function approaches in different
fields one may refer to the ref. [51].

Quantum Entanglement
7.1 Introduction
Entanglement, first coined by Schr¨odinger as Verschra¨nkung, is a phenomenon where a
strong correlation exists between the subsystems of a composite state, regardless of the
distance between them [1]. He observed that the maximal knowledge of a whole system does
not necessarily include knowledge of all its subsystems even if they are totally divided from
each other and do not influence each other at the present time. Quantum systems display
many new features like superposition of quantum states, interference, tunnelling which are
unknown in classical systems even for a single particle system. There are further differences
that manifest themselves in composite quantum systems in the form of entanglement which
is a type of correlation between particles that have no classical counterpart. Schr¨odinger
first recognized a feature implying the existence of global states of composite systems that
cannot be written as a product of the states of individual systems. This phenomenon is
known as entanglement [1]. Entanglement between two states refers to the situation that if
one state is changed then the other state changes automatically.
Consider a particle with two states |0i and |1i. It may be a photon with vertical polar￾ization state or horizontal polarization state. Or it may be an electron with spin-up state
or spin-down state. Now, think of a composite system of two such particles. First, note that
each of the two vector spaces is spanned by similar sets of two basis vectors: {|0i, |1i} and
{|0i, |1i}. Since the composite system space of two particles is produced by tensor product
H1 ⊗ H2 = H, we get

|0i
|1i

⊗ [|0i |1i] = 
|0i1|0i2 |0i1|1i2
|1i1|0i2 |1i1|1i2

=

|00i |01i
|10i |11i

. (7.1)
Thus, {|00i, |01i, |10i, |11i} are the set of the four basis vector of the new entangled space
H. A linear combination of them may yield entangled states. For example, the Bell states
|ψ
±i =
1
√
2
(|01i ± |10i), |φ
±i =
1
√
2
(|00i ± |11i) (7.2a)
are entangled. Suppose |0i and |1i denote the spin-down and spin-up states, respectively,
of a particle along any direction n then for the above specified state the spin for neither
particle is determined. It could be up or down along any direction, during its propagation.
However, if one particle is found to be spin-up (down) in a measurement along a particular
direction then the other one must be spin-down (up) along that direction immediately,
irrespective of the distance between the two particles.
Entanglement was used by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen (EPR) to argue that quantum
mechanics was incomplete as it did not describe reality [2]. Bell developed the local hidden
variable model (LHVM) in order to incorborate the EPR idea of deterministic world into
quantum mechanics. Bell proved that LHVM has to satisfy some inequalities (known as
Bell inequalities) on statistical correlations in experiments involving two particle systems
DOI: 10.1201/9781003172192-7 151152 Quantum Entanglement
[3]. It was proved experimentally that these Bell inequalities are violated for some entangled
states of two particle systems, thus establishing that it is impossible to simulate quantum
correlations within any classical formulation. The entangled states violating a Bell inequality
are termed as nonlocal.
Violation of Bell inequality proved that quantum formulation is nonlocal in nature. (For
more details refer Volume I, Chapter 20.) Entanglement of more than two particles also
leads to a contradiction with LHVM [4]. Initially Bell’s work made the study of quantum
entanglement important for understanding the formulation of quantum theory. But in the
last three decades, entanglement has come to be realized as a potentially valuable resource.
It has been found that one can perform many tasks that are otherwise impossible to do
with classical systems using entangled states. Entanglement finds wide application in the
development of quantum information theory. Quantum information processings like quan￾tum cryptography, quantum teleportation, quantum error correction codes and quantum
computation depend mainly on the use of entangled states.
There are three fundamental issues concerned with entanglement:
1. Theoretical and experimental detection of entanglement.
2. Reversing the degradation of entanglement.
3. Characterization, classification, controlling and quantification of entanglement.
In this chapter after reviewing states in classical mechanics we shall discuss the funda￾mental aspects of characterization of quantum entanglement like the definition, the detec￾tion, the classification and quantification of entanglement. Using density matrices we define
entanglement in mixed states and that of a bipartite pure state. We discuss the determina￾tion of entanglement of bipartite pure state by means of Schmidt coefficients. We present
criteria to identify the separability of quantum states. Then we consider full and partial
separabilities of quantum states of multipartite systems. Then we diiscuss the measures of
entanglement. Finally, we briefly discuss the applications of quantum entanglement.
7.2 States in Classical Mechanics
In the following we briefly review the notions of various kinds of states in classical mechanics
and we mainly follow the ref. [5].
A state of a classical system is represented by a point, say, x0, in an appropriate phase
space X. We can represent a state by means of a scalar valued function. That is, f : X → R,
f(x) = 1 for x = x0 ∈ X otherwise 0. It can be treated as a probability density function
in X. Such a state is termed as a pure state. A mixed state is one with f(xk) = pk > 0,
k = 1, 2, . . . , n with Ppk = 1 and f(xk) = 0 for k > n. A mixed state refers to a situation
wherein the system can be in any one of the set of finite number of points with pk > 0. One
can easily show that a mixed state can be generated by a set of pure states.
A vector space can be formed by the set of all scalar valued functions on X. Suppose
define a set of vectors as S = {vi
: 1 ≤ i ≤ k}. We can define a vector space of the form
Pk
i=1 aivi
, 0 ≤ ai ≤ 1, 1 ≤ i ≤ k,
Pk
i=1 ai = 1 as a convex combination of vectors from
S. For a state f on X we write f(xi) = pi > 0, {xi
: 1 ≤ i ≤ n} and Pn
i=1 pi = 1 or
f =
Pn
i=1 pifxi where fxi
represent pure states for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. We note that f is a pure
state or a convex combination of pure states.
Let us consider a system with two particles: particle-1with phase space X and particle-2
with phase space Y . The phase space of the composite system is X × Y . Denote the pureQuantum Entangled States 153
states of the subsystems X and Y as fx0
and gy0
, respectively. fx0 ⊗ gy0 = fx0 × gy0
. The
tensor product of pure states of the subsystems is given by
[fx0 × gx0
] (x, y) = fx0
(x) × gy0
(y)
= δx0x × δy0y
=



1, if x = x0, y = y0
0, otherwise.
(7.3)
The composite states fx0 ⊗ fy0 are termed as product state. From the above it is clear that
for a composite system, each pure state is of the form of a product of pure states of the
subsystems. (Is it true for quantum systems?)
Suppose the state of a composite system is, say, expressed as Pn
i=1 pifi⊗gi with {fi} and
{gi} are the states of the subsystems. Such a state is called a separable state. A nonseparable
state is termed as an entangled state. Further, a state which is not expressible as a convex
combination of product states is essentially referred as an entangled state.
As noted earlier, each and every classical state is either a pure state or a convex com￾bination of pure states. Moreover, a pure state is a product state for a composite system.
Therefore, classical composite states are separable states implying that classically no en￾tangled state exists.
7.3 Quantum Entangled States
Consider a quantum system-1 described by a finite dimensional Hilbert space H1. The state
of the system |ψ1i is described by a vector in H1. If {|uii, i = 1, 2, . . . , n} form the basis
of the n-dimensional Hilbert space H1 then the state vector can be written as a linear
combination of the kets |uii as
|ψ1i =
Xn
i=1
ai
|uii,
X|ai
|
2 = 1. (7.4)
As the ket |ψ1i represents a vector in H1, it is called a pure state. Similarly, a second
quantum system-2 described by the Hilbert space H2 of dimension m will have a pure state
|ψ2i =
Xm
j=1
bj |vj i,
X|bj |
2 = 1, (7.5)
where the orthonormal kets {|vj i, j = 1, 2, . . . , m} span H2.
Next, consider a biparticle composite quantum system comprising the two subsystems-1
and 2. The total Hilbert space of the composite system H is a tensor product of the two
subsystem spaces H = H1 ⊗ H2. The Hilbert space H consists of all vectors that can be
written as a superposition in the form
|ψi =
Xn
i=1
Xm
j=1
Cij (|uii ⊗ |vj i) (7.6)
for some choice of the complex coefficients and |uii⊗|vj i = |uii|vj i. |ψi cannot be in general
regarded as a product of the states of individual subsystems
|ψi 6= |ψ1i ⊗ |ψ2i. (7.7)154 Quantum Entanglement
If |ψi is not a direct product as given by Eq. (7.7) then the state |ψi is said to be entangled.
If we consider N separate systems each described in the Hilbert space Hi
, i = 1, 2, . . . , N
then according to quantum theory, the total Hilbert space of the composite system is a tensor
product of the subsystem spaces H =
N
⊗
i=1
Hi
. Then according to the superposition principle,
the total state of the system is [6]
|ψi =
X
iN
CiN |iN i, iN = i1, i2, . . . , iN (7.8a)
in which iN is the multi-index and
|iN i = |i1i ⊗ |i2i ⊗ . . . . . . ⊗ |iN i (7.8b)
with |iii is the orthonormal basis of Hi for the ith subsystem. In general, |ψi is not a
product of the states of individual subsystems:
|ψi 6= |ψ1i ⊗ |ψ2i ⊗ . . . . . . ⊗ |ψN i. (7.9)
|ψii is a pure state in the Hilbert space Hi of the ith subsystem. If |ψi is not the direct
product of the pure states of the subsystems, then |ψi is said to be entangled. If
|ψi = |ψ1i ⊗ |ψ2i ⊗ . . . . . . ⊗ |ψN i (7.10)
then |ψi is not entangled and is said to be separable. If |ψi is separable then the local
measurement outcomes on different subsystems are uncorrelated with each other and depend
only on the states of each respective subsystems.
Example:
Consider a biparticle separable system |ψi = |ψ1i ⊗ |ψ2i and assume a Hermitian operator
O1 that operates only on H1. Since a local measurement is done on system-1, we can
consider the local observable as O1 ⊗ 1 which will operate O1 on the system-1 and leave
the system-2 unaffected due to the identity operator 1. Since O1 operates on |ψ1i, it will
project an eignestate of O1, but the state |ψ2i will be unaffected due to the 1 operation.
If later on, we perform a local operation 1 ⊗ O2 on system-2, it will project an eigenstate
of O2, leaving the state |ψ1i unaffected. This result will be independent of the first result.
Hence, the local measurement outcomes on different subsystems are uncorrelated with each
other and depend only on the states of each respective subsystems. On the other hand, if
|ψi 6= |ψ1i ⊗ |ψ2i, then the local measurements on one subsystem will affect the state of the
other subsystem and hence the measurements will be correlated.
In the above we considered entanglement between separate systems. An example of this
is the singlet state of, say, two spins- 1
2
; | ↑i1| ↓i2 − | ↓i1| ↑i2. One may think of another type
of entanglement between different properties of a single system. An example is entangling
external motional (|x1i, |x2i) and (| ↑i, | ↓i): |x1i| ↑i+|x2i| ↓i. In this book we are concerned
with the former type.

can be treated as containing a complete knowledge of the two-spin system but no definite
information about the spin property of each electron.1

It is an entangled state.
Interference effect and state projection accompanying measurement can be used to create
an entanglement between two separated particles [7]. For example, consider qubits of two
ions. They can be encoded in hyperfine levels of the electronic ground states and prepared in
the superposition states 1
2
(|gi + |ei), where |gi and |ei represent ground and excited states,
respectively. These qubits undergo simultaneously single-photon scattering when excited by

with the qubit states:

[|gi1,2|bluei + |ei1,2|redi] . (7.16)
We can then send the photons simultaneously through a 50:50 beam splitter and detect
them using two detectors A and B. If photons are found simultaneously detected at A and
B then it implies the projection of the ions into the Bell state

Note that here the atoms did not interact directly. This scheme is useful for entanglement
assisted communication between ion locations, say 1 and 2.
7.4 Mixed States
A pure state state is a vector or a ray in Hilbert space. But usually we encounter only mixed
states rather than pure states. In that case we cannot define entanglement for mixed state
as equivalent to being nonproduct state as defined for pure state by Eq. (7.9). As mixed
state is described by density matrix, entanglement of a mixed state is also defined using
density matrices.
7.4.1 Density Operator
The density operator (matrix) is used to describe the state of a quantum system in a more
general way than provided by the state vector of the Hilbert space. It is more useful to
describe an ensemble of mixed states for which a state vector cannot be formed. (For more
information on density operator, refer Chapter 7, Volume I.) If pi
is the probability for the
qubit to be in the state |ψii then the density operator is defined as
ρ =
X
i
pi
|ψiihψi
| =
X
i
piρi
,
X
i
pi = 1. (7.18)
If we choose an arbitrary orthonormal basis {|uj i} then P
j
|uj ihuj | = 1. In such a basis
the density matrix element is given by
ρkl =
X
i
pihuk|ψiihψi
|uli. (7.19)
The expectation value of any observable O with matrix element Okl = huk|O|uli is given
by hOi = Tr(ρO), where Tr is the trace of the matrix.
The density matrix is Hermitian and its trace is equal to 1. The density operator of a
pure state |ψi is given by ρ = |ψihψ|, ρ
2 = |ψihψ|ψihψ| = ρ. Hence, Tr(ρ
2
) = 1 as Tr(ρ) = 1.
For a mixed state one can show that 0 < Tr(ρ
2
) < 1 (see the solved problem 2).

7.4.2 Bloch Sphere
As any 2×2 matrix can be written as a linear combination of the unit matrix and the Pauli
matrices σx, σy and σz, an arbitrary single qubit density matrix can be written as [8]
ρ =
1
2
[I + P · σ] , (7.23)
where P is an arbitrary real vector of length |P| < 1. |P| is the radius of a sphere called
Bloch sphere. We get from Eq. (7.23) Tr ￾

= 1. The
pure states are on the surface of the Bloch sphere, where as mixed states with |P| < 1 are
inside the sphere.
7.4.3 Reduced Density Matrix
Consider a biparticle composite system consisting of system-1 and system-2. Let ρ be the
density matrix of the composite system on H = H1 ⊗ H2 describing a statistical ensemble
of the combined system. Then the reduced density matrices for the subsystems 1 and 2 are
defined as
ρ1 = Tr2(ρ), ρ2 = Tr1(ρ). (7.24)
For ρ1, the trace is performed over H2 only and for ρ2, the trace is performed over H1 only.
This is known as partial trace.
If the kets |a1i and |a2i belong to H1 and |b1i and |b2i belong to H2 then the partial
trace can be defined as follows:
Tr1 (|a1iha2| ⊗ |b1ihb2|) = (Tr|a1iha2|)|b1ihb2| , (7.25)
Tr2 (|a1iha2| ⊗ |b1ihb2|) = |a1iha2|(Tr|b1ihb2|). (7.26)
This rule combined with linearity enables to compute partial traces in all the cases. The
physical meaning of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem is that it describes everyt158 Quantum Entanglement
that is accessible by local operations in that particular subsystem. One can construct a
general pure state as a linear combination of pure states in H as
|ψi =
1
√
2
(|ψ1i ⊗ |ψ2i + |φ1i ⊗ |φ2i), |ψii 6= |φii, i = 1, 2. (7.27)
Suppose we make a measurement of a local observable O1 for the subsystem-1. As the
operator O1 operates on H1, it will not affect the states |ψ2i and |φ2i of H2. Hence, the
expectation value observed for system-1 will be hO1i = hψ|O1 ⊗ 12|ψi. Using Eq. (7.19) we
get
hO1i = Tr (O1 ⊗ 12ρ), (7.28)
where the density matrix of the composite system is ρ = |ψihψ|. Then
hO1i = Tr (O1 ⊗ 12|ψihψ|) = Tr1 (O1Tr2|ψihψ|). (7.29)
Using Eq. (7.24) we obtain hO1i = Tr1 (O1ρ1), where Tr1,2 denotes the partial trace over
the first/second subsystem and ρ1 = Tr2ρ is the reduced matrix of the first subsystem.
Thus, ρ1 as defined by Eq. (7.24) describes completely the subsystem-1 and ρ2 describes
completely the subsystem-2.
7.5 Bipartite Systems
We shall consider finite-dimensional bipartite quantum systems which are composed of two
distinct subsystems 1 and 2, described by the Hilbert space H = H1 ⊗ H2. For example,
consider a particle with two states |0i and |1i. It may be a photon with vertical polarization
state or horizontal polarization state. Or it may be an electron with spin-up state or spin￾down state.
7.5.1 Basis Vectors
Now, consider a composite system of two such particles. We must note that each of the
two vector spaces is spanned by similar set of two basis vectors: {ui} = {|0i1, |1i1} and
{vj} = {|0i2, |1i2}. Then any pure state in the Hilbert space H can be written as Eq. (7.6),
that is,
|ψi =
X
2
i=1
X

j=1
Cij |uii ⊗ |vj i,

Therefore, |00i, |01i, |10i and |11i are the four basis vectors spanning the Hilbert space H
of the bipartite system.Bipartite Systems 159
7.5.2 Bipartite Entanglement in Pure State
Any linear combination of the basis vectors of H will give a pure state. We have already
defined by Eq. (7.7) the entanglement of pure states as a pure state in H which cannot
be written as the product of the pure states of the Hilbert space of the two subsystems.
If we can write |ψi = |ψ1i ⊗ |ψ2i, where |ψ1i and |ψ2i are pure states in H1 and H2, and
|ψi is a pure state in H then |ψi is said to be separable. A linear combination of the basis
vectors in H may yield entangled states. For example, the Bell states given by Eq. (7.2) are
entangled. Note that measurement at only one of the subsystems leads to finding it with
equal proabability in the state |0i or |1i. That is, the states provide no knowledge about
the subsystems. On the other hand, the states are pure as a whole thereby giving maximal
knowledge about the whole system.
One can define the entanglement of a bipartite pure state in terms of the density matrices
also. Suppose for a pure state |ψi, its density matrix ρ = |ψihψ| 6= ρ1 ⊗ ρ2, where ρ1 =
|ψ1ihψ1| and ρ2 = |ψ2ihψ2| are the density matrices of the subsystems 1 and 2, respectively.
As ρ 6= ρ1⊗ρ2, if a local measurement is performed in any of the subsystem it leads to a state
reduction of the whole composite system state |ψi, not only on the subsystem on which the
measurement has been done. Thus, the probabilities for the outcomes on local measurements
on one subsystem are influenced by prior measurements of the other subsystem even if the
two subsystems are well separated. For pure states the two subsystems are entangled if
ρ 6= ρ1 ⊗ ρ2 and separable if ρ = ρ1 ⊗ ρ2.
7.5.3 Schmidt Decomposition
One can find a special basis representation of bipartite state |ψi performing Schmidt de￾composition [9–11]. The coordinates in this represenation called the Schmidt coefficients
completely determine the entanglement of the bipartite pure state. Schmidt decomposition
is obtained using singular-value decomposition (SVD) of linear algebra. In SVD method
of linear algebra, any arbitrary matrix A ∈ C
m×n of rank k can be always expressed as
A = V DU†
, where V ∈ C
m×m, U = C
n×n and the diagonal matrix D = [dij ] ∈ C
m×n. The
nonvasishing elements of D are the so-called singular-values ai
:
d11 = a1, d22 = a2, . . . , dkk = ak (7.33)
which are the square-root of the eigenvalues of AA†
. The columns of V and U are the eigen￾vectors of AA† and A†A, respectively. Using SVD we can perform Schmidt decomposition
for the bipartite pure state
|ψi =

where |i1i is the orthonormal basis of H1 of dimension m and |j2i is the orthonormal basis

m×n. Applying SVD
to the matrix [C], we obtain

vector |l1i in H1. Similarly, Pn
j=1 U
∗
jl|j2i gives the ket |l2i in H2. We find from Eq. (7.35),
|ψi is obtained in a transformed basis (Schmidt basis) |l1i|l2i as

pl = 1. (7.37)
√pl are known as the Schmidt coefficients of the state and are real and positive [12]. What
do these Schmidt coefficients represent? (See the exercise 7 at the end of this chapter.) k
is called the Schmidt rank of the pure bipartite state. k is equal to the number of nonzero
Schmidt coefficients. We have [12]
k ≤ min(dim(H1), dim(H2)). (7.38)
The Schmidt coefficients are invariant under any local unitary transformation. As the en￾tanglement is in general both qualitatively and quantitatively invariant under local unitary
transformations, Schmidt coefficients are considered to determine completely the entangle￾ment of bipartite pure state.
|ψi is separable if it is a product state. From Eq. (7.37) we observe that for a product
state, there must be only one nonzero value of the Schmidt coefficient √pl = 1. Otherwise,
a bipartite pure state is entangled. That is, from Eq. (7.37), for any pure product state
the Schmidt rank k = 1 while k > 1 for entangled state. Therefore, a pure state can be
determined whether it is separable or entangled by diagonalizing its reduced density matrix.

Tr2|0i2 2h0| = 1, Tr2|1i2 2h1| = 1, (7.40a)

7.5.4 Bipartite Entanglement in Mixed State
We have so far considered only bipartite entanglement in pure states. But only mixed states
are mostly encountered in real experiments since it is hardly possible to isolate a system
with its environment. As we have seen earlier, the separability of pure states can be easily
checked using Schmidt decomposition. But it is much more difficult to decide whether a
given mixed state is entangled or not. As a mixed state is defined by a density matrix, we
cannot define entanglement of mixed states to be nonproduct states as we defined for the
case of pure states. A mixed state of n systems is separable if the density matrix of the
composite system can be written as a convex combination of the product states [13]

pi = 1. In general hij |i

. (7.45)
Using the above definition alone one cannot normally check whether a given mixed state ρ
is separable or not.
7.6 Separability Criteria
It is of primary importance to test whether a given quantum state is separable or entangled.
A pure state is separable if there exists a decomposition of this state into product state.
A mixed state is separable if there exists a decomposition of this state into a convex sum
as given by Eq. (7.43). It is not an easy task to find such a decomposition. Hence, some
other criteria are used to distinguish separable states from entangled states. There are162 Quantum Entanglement
separability criteria for pure states which discriminate the separable and entangled states
unambiquously. But for mixed states, such tools are available only for low-dimensional
systems. For higher-dimensional systems only partial information about separability can be
obtained using these criteria.
7.6.1 The Peres Criterion
The Peres criterion [14] known as positive partial transpose (PPT) criterion is an important
criterion to find the separability of mixed states at least for low-dimensional systems. It
states that the partial transpose of any separable state must be a positive semidefinite
matrix. The partial transpose of a mathematical operator is a mathematical operation that
treats the state as a product state and transposes one subsystem. If ρ = ρ1 ⊗ ρ2 then
ρ
T2 = ρ1 ⊗ ρ
T
2
. The matrix elements of ρ transform under the partial transpose operation
of the subsystem-2 as
hm|µ|ρ
T2
|ni|νi = hm|ν|ρ|ni|µi. (7.46)
The Peres criterion is easily proved for a bipartite system. The condition of separability
is
ρ =
X

piρ
i
1 ⊗ ρ

. (7.47)
The partial transpose of the state with respect to subsystem-2 gives

Since the transpose operator does not change the characteristics like positivity, unit trace
and Hermiticity, ρ
iT
2 also represents a state. Hence, Eq. (7.48) represents a separable state
like Eq. (7.47). The set of states with PPT is identical to the set of separable states only in
2 × 2 and 2 × 3 dimensions [15].
As an example, we consider a Wigner state which is a d × d dimensional bipartite
quantum state that is invariant under any unitary operation of the form U ⊗ U
∗

density matrix of such a state then

For example, a Wigner state is defined by the density matrix
ρ = α|ψ
−ihψ

1 − α

1 ⊗ 1. (7.50)
The interval for the parameter α is decided by the requirement Trρ = 1. Since |ψ

(|01i − |10i), we obtain
ρ =

As Trρ = 1, it represents a quantum state. It can be proved that all eigenvalues of ρ
given by Eq. (7.51) are positive for the range −1 ≤ α ≤ 1. Taking the partial transpose of
Eq. (7.51) with respect to the subsystem-2 we get
ρ

The eigenvalues of this matrix are λ1 = λ2 = λ3 = (1 + α)/4 and λ4 = (1 − 3α)/4. The last
eigenvalue will be negative if α > 1/3. Since the eigenvalues of ρ are positive for the range
−1 ≤ α ≤ 1 and one of the eigenvalues of ρ
T2
is negative if α > 1/3, by applying PPT
criterion we find for the given Wigner state
−1 ≤ α ≤

It can be seen that the PPT condition is equivalent to demanding the positivity of the
operator [1 ⊗ T2]ρ. The transposition map T2 acting on the subsystem-2 is a positive (P)
map but it is not completely positive (CP). It has been noted that any P but not CP map
Λ provides a nontrivial necessary separability criterion in the form
[11 ⊗ Λ2] ρ ≥ 0. (7.54)
The state ρ is separable if and only if the above condition is satisfied for all P and not CP
maps Λ [15].
7.6.2 Entanglement Witnesses
For dimensions greater than 2 ⊗ 2 and 2 ⊗ 3, one can still use PPT to find separable states.
For higher-dimensional systems all states with negative partial transpose are entangled but
there are entangled states with a PPT. Therefore, PPT is not a reliable tool to detect
separability for such cases. In fact, there exists no single separability condition for higher￾dimensional systems.
There are several tools available to detect quantum entanglement. Among them entan￾glement witnesses are extensively used for characterizing quantum entanglement. Terhal
[16] introduced the term entanglement witnesses for operators detecting quantum entan￾glement states. It is found that any entangled state can be detected by some entanglement
witnesses. A full classification of states of composite quantum system can be done from the
knowledge of entanglement witnesses.
Entanglement witnesses (say W) are observables (Hermitian). They have at least one
negative eigenvalue and a nonnegative mean value on product states. If |ψ1i|ψ2i represents
any arbitrary product state |ψi then W satisfy the nonnegative condition hψ|W|ψi > 0.
The state represented by the density matrix ρ is separable if it has a nonnegative mean
value
Tr(W ρ) ≥ 0. (7.55)
That is, the state ρ is entangled if and only if
Tr(W ρ) < 0. (7.56)
For example, the Hermitian swap operator
V =
X
d−1
i=0
X
d−1
j=0
|iihj| ⊗ |jihi| (7.57)164 Quantum Entanglement
is the entanglement witness for the d ⊗ d case. |ii and |ji are the d-basis vectors of H1 and
H2.
An entanglement witness W is decomposable if it can be written as
W = αP + (1 − α)Q
T1
, (7.58)
where P and Q are some positive operators and T1 is a partial transpose on subsystem￾1 [16]. Decomposable entanglement witnesses cannot detect entanglement of PPT states.
There exists some witness W for detection of any entangled state. But there is no general
method for construction of entanglement witnesses.
The map condition (7.54) is equivalent to the set of witness condition (7.55). But any
simple witness condition is much weaker than the condition given by the map Λ. For ex￾ample, the transposition map T detects all entanglements in the two-qubit case, where as
the swap operator V defined by Eq. (7.57) does not detect entanglement of any symmetric
pure state.
An entanglement witness W1 is finer than W2 if and only if the entanglement of any ρ
detected by W2 is also detected by W1. If there is no witness finer than W then it is called
optimal. Typical W is defined [17,18] for the Hilbert subspace PW by the condition
{|φ1i|φ2i : hφ1|hφ2|W|φ1i|φ2i = 0} . (7.59)
How many witnesses have to be measured to arrive at a conclusion? A conclusive answer
may not be obtained if we consider the expectation values of the witnesses one by one [19].
We can use the expectation values of properly chosen witnesses jointly. In this case d
2 − 1
witnesses are required for a d-dimensional system. It is possible to reduce this number by
making use of all the information collected when computing the expectation values of the
witnesses measured successively.
Entanglement witnesses have been useful in experimental detection of entanglement be￾cause entanglement witnesses are observables [6]. It has been used in quantum optics [20,21],
quantum cryptography [22], nanophysics [23], cluster states [24] and hidden nonlocality [25],
a few to mention. The witness-family-based entanglement detection scheme has been intro￾duced [18] and verified [26]. An experimental method for detecting a collective universal
witness that is a necessary and sufficient measure of two-photon polarization entanglement
was proposed [27].
7.6.3 Bell Inequalities
As the separable states do not violate any Bell inequality, they can be used to detect
separability of a state. But it has been found that all entangled states do not violate a
Bell inequality [13,28]. The Bell inequalities can be considered as nonoptimal witnesses as
they are not able to detect all entangled states. The relation between Bell inequalities and
witnesses was first studied by Terhal [16]. The Bell inequality derived by Clauser, Hone,
Shimony and Holf (CHSH) [29] provides a way of detecting experimentally the LHVM.
Consider a correlation experiment in which variables (A1, A2) are measured in
subsystem-1 and the variables (B1, B2) are measured in spatially separated subsystem-2
of a whole system. Further, assume that A1, A2, B1 and B2 can take only ±1 values. Then
for LHVM to be valid the inequality to be satisfied is
|E(A1, B1) + E(A1, B2) + E(A2, B1) − E(A2, B2)| ≤ 2, (7.60)
where E(Ai
, Bj ) is the expectation of the correlation experiment AiBj . If we consider the
CHSH operator
BCHSH = A1 ⊗ (B1 + B2) + A2 ⊗ (B1 − B2), (7.61)Multipartite Entanglement 165
where A1 = a1 · σ, A2 = a2 · σ, B1 = b1 · σ and B2 = b2 · σ, where σ = (σx, σy, σz) is
the vector of Pauli spin operators, a = (ax, ay, az) and b = (bx, by, bz) are the unit vectors
describing the measurements in subsystem-1 and subsystem-2, respectively. If a state defined
by the density matrix ρ admits the LHVM then the CHSH inequality
|Tr (BCHSH ρ)| ≤ 0 (7.62)
is satisfied. As separable states admit LHVM, one can define CHSH-type witness
WCHSH = 2I − BCHSH. (7.63)
A Bell observable is a double witness as it detects both entanglement and nonlocality.
A special case of the CHSH inequality is the Freedman’s inequality. For a detailed
discussion on it one may refer to [30].
7.7 Multipartite Entanglement
Multipartite entanglement theory is much complex compared to the bipartite case. One
cannot generalize the results of bipartite entanglement to multipartite entanglement. The
multipartite entanglement exhibits a variety of forms which are not easily distinguishable
and are very difficult to identify them. Just like in bipartite case we can define full separa￾bility for the multipartite cases. But unlike in bipartite case we can define many types of
partial separability.
For discussions on nonlinear separability criteria, general separability criteria based on
uncertainty relation, separability criterion in terms of covariance matrices and the use of
uncertainty relation in detecting entanglement one may refer to the refs. [6,31–35].
7.7.1 Full Separability
Consider a n-partite composite system in the Hilbert space H = H1 ⊗ H2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ Hn. The
full separability of the n-partite system is defined if the state ρ in H can be written as
Eq. (7.43), where l in this equation is ≤ dimH2
. Such a defined set of n-separable state is
convex and closed. For example, the three-qubit state
ρ = p|0ih0|
⊗3 + (1 − p)|1ih1|
⊗3
(7.64)
is fully separable.
A n-partite pure state is fully separable only if it is a product of the pure states of
the n-elementary subsystems. Thus, one can compute the reduced density matrices of the
subsystems and check whether they are pure or not. However, this simple separability condi￾tion is violated in many ways. For example, in multipartite case, the pure states admit only
rarely the Schmidt decomposition. The generalized entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
(GHZ) state
|GHZi
(n)
d =
1
√
d
X
d−1
i=0
|ii
⊗n
(7.65)
admits Schmidt decomposition. For the three-qubit GHZ state
|GHZi
(3)
2 =
1
√
2
(|0i|0i|0i + |1i|1i|1i) (7.66)166 Quantum Entanglement
one can perform Schmidt decomposition. But the entangled state
|Wi =
1
√
3
(|0i|0i|1i + |0i|1i|0i + |1i|0i|0i) (7.67)
which has an entangled subsystem, does not admit Schmidt decomposition. Thus, a fully
separable n-partite state must be the direct product of the n-state vectors of the subsystems
as
|ψi = |ψ1i ⊗ |ψ2i ⊗ . . . ⊗ |ψni. (7.68)
7.7.2 Partial Separability
Violation of condition (7.68) cannot be considered as the decomposition of n-partite en￾tanglement. When classifying the entanglement in multipartite system, one must take into
account the number and nature of entangled subsystems. For example, a triqubit pure state
can be classified as
1. fully separable state,
2. biseparable state and
3. fully entangled state.
Even for fully entangled triqubit pure state, classification can be done by means of local
operation and classification with nonzero probability [36]. It is found that any fully entangled
triqubit state can be converted into one of the two standard forms, namely, the GHZ state
(Eq. (7.66)) or the W-state (Eq. (7.67)).
A complete hierarchic classification of a family of states based on the separability prop￾erties of the partitions of the systems into subsystems has been proposed [37,38]. A k￾separable state with n-particles (n ≥ k) is defined if a pure state ρ in H can be written as
ρ = ρ1 ⊗ ρ2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ ρk, where ρj is the density matrix of the jth part of the partition. A
mixed state ρ is k-separable if
ρ =
X
M
i=1
piρ
(i)
1 ⊗ ρ
(i)
2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ ρ
(i)
k
. (7.69)
In the hierarchic classification, all possible partitions of k parts for all k (k ∈ (2, 3, . . . , n))
are considered and then each partition is detected whether the given state is k-separable
or not. We have to continue the procedure starting with k = n, continuing with k =
n − 1, n − 2, . . . until k = 2. At each level k we need to consider all possible partitions of
k-separability. Note that the different levels of this structure are not independent of each
other. The study of partial separable states are important as different types of partially
separable states have been used for many different applications.
Hyper-entanglement refers to the simultaneous entanglement in more than one degree
of freedom. It includes polarization-momentum, polarization-time-bin, polarization-spatial
modes-energy-time entanglements and so on [39–41].
7.8 Quantifying Entanglement
It is in general possible to detect whether a quantum state is entangled or not. But
the amount of entanglement cannot be easily determined for general mixed states.Quantifying Entanglement 167
Quantification of entanglement is very much needed in many applications of entanglement.
But there exists no measure of entanglement which satisfies all the properties of a good mea￾sure of entanglement. Consequently, many different measures of entanglement are considered
for quantifying entanglement. These measures are considered with different motivations and
they have their own strengths and weaknesses.
7.8.1 Entanglement Measure
If we have an entangled state ρ then the entanglement measure E(ρ) maps ρ into a single
real number. Therefore, E(ρ) is defined as the map: E(ρ) : ρ ↔ x such that x ∈ R. The
measure E(ρ) must satisfy the following four conditions:
1. E(ρ) = 0 if the state ρ is separable.
2. Any local unitary transformation U1 ⊗ U2 will not change E(ρ), that is,
E(ρ) = E

U1 ⊗ U2ρU†
1 ⊗ U
†
2

. (7.70)
3. Local operation (LO), classical communication (CC) and sub-selection (SS) do
not increase entanglement [42,43]. Hence, if ρ
LOCCSS
−−−−−→ X
i
piρi then
E(ρ) ≥
X
i
piE(ρi). (7.71)
4. If ρ = ρ1 × ρ2 then E(ρ) = E(ρ1) + E(ρ2).
Sometimes additional requirements for entanglement measures like convexity, additivity,
continuity are imposed [44]. For pure bipartite states von Neumann entropy of entanglement
is accepted as a canonical measure. Several measures are considered for mixed states.
7.8.2 Von Neumann Entropy of Entanglement
The quantum counterpart of Shannon entropy of information theory is the von Neumann
entropy which is defined for a quantum state ρ as
S(ρ) = −Tr (ρ log2 ρ). (7.72)
As it maps a density matrix into a number, it can be a measure of the entanglement of
the state ρ. S(ρ) also satisfies all the four conditions of measure. Von Neumann entropy is
interpreted as a measure of unpredictability of measurement of quantum state.
If ρ1 and ρ2 are the density operators of subsystems of the composite system ρ then the
conditional von Neumann entropy is given by
S (ρ1|ρ2) = S (ρ) − S (ρ2). (7.73)
The conditional entropy can be negative. Therefore, the entropy of the subsystem may be
greater than the entropy of the joint system. Hence, the knowledge (information) of the
joint system is greater than that of the subsystem. This is true only for entangled states.
As log can be extended on operators one can use the spectral decomposition of ρ to obtain
S(ρ) = −

7.8.3 Distillable Entanglement and Entanglement Cost
Many applications of quantum information theory like quantum teleportation uses the pure
maximally entangled state − Bell state |ψ
+i. But we usually get only mixed state due to
imperfection of operational coupling with environment and decoherence. The question of
obtaining the maximally entangled states from the noisy mixed state was considered in [45]
and established a paradigm for purification of entanglement by means of LOCC operations.
This process is called entanglement distillation.
Suppose two distant parties share n copies of a bipartite noisy mixed state ρ. Then they
can perform some LOCC and obtain in turn k (< n) copies of the systems in a state which
is very close to the pure maximally entangled state. A sequence of LOCC operations to
obtain this entanglement purification is called entangled distillation protocal. The efficiency
with which one can achieve this process of distillation defines an asymptotic entanglement
measure known as distillable entanglement ED(ρ). It gives the best rate at which one can
transform ρ
⊗n into k singletQuantifying Entanglement 169
The distillable entanglement is the supremum of such states over all distillation protocals
(Λ). It is defined as [44]
ED(ρ) = sup n

, (7.78)
where Φ (2rn)
+ = (|φ+ihφ+|)
⊗rn and || · || is the trace norm and Λ are the trace preserving
LOCC operations. Because of the complexity of this variational definition very little progress
has been made in computing ED(ρ). It equals the entropy of entanglement for pure states.
We note that entangled states allowing the creation of a maximally entangled state by
LOCC opeations in at least one bipartition of the composite system are essentially distillable.
A distillable state can be transformable into a nonlocal state using only LOCC. However,
not every nonlocal state is distillable. For a PPT state the distillable entanglement is zero.
The entangled states with zero distillable entanglement are termed as bound entangled states
[46]. Such states are though entangled but not distillable.
Another useful entanglement measure is the entanglement cost EC(ρ) which is duel
to ED(ρ). EC(ρ) defines the maximally possible rate r at which we can convert blocks of
maximally entangled state using LOCC (Λ) operations to obtain many copies of ρ such that
the approximations become vanishingly small in the limit of large block sizes. EC(ρ) is the
reverse of ED(ρ). It is defined as [44]
EC(ρ) = inf n

This quantity is also very difficult to compute. ED(ρ) and EC(ρ) are two most important
measures for entanglement of bipartite mixed states. These two are equal for pure states.
7.8.4 Entanglement of Formation and Concurrence
There are other two well defined quantitative measures of entanglement, namely, entan￾glement of formation (EoF) [42,45] and concurrence [47,48]. EoF for a bipartite state ρ is
defined as the partial entropy with respect to the subsystems as
Ef(ρ) = −Tr (ρ1 log2 ρ1) = −Tr (ρ2 log2 ρ2). (7.80)
Ef(ρ) vanishes only for product states. For a mixed state Ef(ρ) is defined by the convex
roof as
Ef(ρ) = min
(pi|ρi)
X
pi
Ef(ρi) (7.81)
for all possible realizations. We have
ρ =
X
i
piρi
, pi ≥ 0,
X
i
pi = 1. (7.82)
Therefore, ρ is separable only if Ef(ρ) = 0. Ef(ρ) defined by Eq. (7.81) satisfies all the
essential requirements of a good entanglement measure. But it is extremely difficult to
calculate Ef(ρ) as one has to find the minimum of the calculation Eq. (7.81) for all possible
realizations.
One feature that distinguishes Ef from ED is that Ef will be zero only if ρ is separable
whereas ED can be zero even for nonseparable states. Though Ef
is in general very difficult
to calculate there exists general formulas for certain systems and certain classes of states170 Quantum Entanglement
For example, for 2 × 2 systems Ef can be expressed in terms of concurrence C(ψ) which
is expressed for a pure state ψ as
C(ψ) = |hψ
∗
|σy ⊗ σy|ψi|. (7.83)
|ψ
∗
i is the complex conjugate of |ψi. If |ψi =

{|00i, |01i, |10i, |11i} then
|ψ

For an arbitrary two-qubit pure state |ψi = α|00i + β|01i + γ|10i + δ|11i we obtain C(ψ) =
2|αδ − βγ| with |α|
2 + |β|
2 + |γ|
2 + |δ|
2 = 1 (see the solved problem 5 below). On the other
hand, for |ψ

i = α|00i + β|11i the concurrence is C(ψ

ψi
, then the minimum of Ef as defined by Eq.(7.81) can be found by using the relation
(7.88).
Measurement of the concurrence with linear optics [49], trapped ions [50], cross-Kerr
nonlinearity [51] and its detection in atomic-qubit pure state [52] and cavity QED system
[53] have been reported.
7.8.5 Entanglement Negativity
Another measure of entanglement is the entanglement negativity N A|B [54–56]. It quantifies
the amount of entanglement between the parts A and B if they are in a state ρAB. N A|B is
the absolute value of the sum of negative eigenvalues of ρ
TA
AB, where TA represents partial
transpose with respect to the subsystem A. That is,
N
A|B =

where ||X||1 = Tr√

7.9 Applications of Entanglement
In this section we enumerate some of the promising applications of entanglement.
1. The philosophical debates on quantum entanglement started by the EPR para￾dox was brought to a conclusion by Bell’s theorem and numerous experimental
verifications of Bell’s inequalities. But it was found later that it is a new resource
which can be exploited to perform many tasks that cannot be performed by any
classical resources [57]. It was found that the entangled states can be used in a
variety of real-world applications.
2. Ekert [58] found that entangled states along with the Bell inequalities can be used
to produce a private cryptographic key. He discovered entangled-based quantum
key distribution. It is different from the original BB84 scheme which directly
uses quantum communication (refer chapter 10 for more information on quantum
cryptography).
3. Quantum Dense Coding: Another important application of quantum entan￾glement is the quantum dense coding [59]. According to classical information
theory, if we want to send a message in the form of N distinguishable states then
the maximum number of different messages we have to send is N. That is, we
can send at most log2 N bits of information. Qubit can thus carry at most only
one bit of classical information. But dense coding allows us to communicate two
classical bits by sending one a priori entangled qubit.
In Bennett and Wiesner’s idea of dense coding the sender and receiver, say Alice
and Bob, share an entangled single state
|ψ1i =
1
√
2
(|0i|0i + |1i|1i). (7.90)172 Quantum Entanglement
Suppose Alice wants to tell Bob any one of the four events k ∈ (1, 2, 3, 4). Alice
performs one of the four unitary operations σ = 1, σ2 = σz, σ3 = σx and σ4 = σy
and return half of the entangled states back to Bob transforming |ψ1i into one of
the four original signal states
|ψ1i = 1 ⊗ 1|ψ1i =
1
√
2
(|00i + |11i), (7.91a)
|ψ2i = 1 ⊗ σz|ψ1i =
1
√
2
(|00i − |11i), (7.91b)
|ψ3i = 1 ⊗ σx|ψ1i =
1
√
2
(|01i + |10i), (7.91c)
|ψ4i = 1 ⊗ σy|ψ1i =
1
√
2
(|01i − |10i) (7.91d)
which Bob can discriminate and identify them as they are orthogonal states. (For
the proof of the relations (7.91) see the exercise 7.20 at the end of this chapter.)
In this way acting locally only on a single two-state system, Alice can send two
bits of classical information to Bob. The first experimental implementation of
quantum dense coding was reported in [60].
4. Entangled two-photon microscopy: Microscopy based on classical sources of
light are considerably noisy because of the photons arriving randomly in time
and position. The two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscopy (TPLSM)
is found to be more efficient. This technique uses a highly focused optical beam
in order to localize the region from which fluorescence is observed. For classical
light the rate of simultaneous absorption of 2 photons is proportional to φ
2
,
where φ is the optical photon flux density. Thus, in TPLSM, the rate of two￾photon absorption is proportional to φ
2
. TPLSM needs the utility of high photon
flux density sources (such as femtosecond pulsed lasers), to make sure that two
photons have a significantly considerable probability of reaching simultaneously
and resulting in an absorption.
Entangled photon microscopy (EPM) using quantum photon pairs as source was
proposed [61]. EPM offers several advantages over TPLSM. In EPM, the entan￾gled photons’ arrival times are correlated. As a result the two-photon absorption
rate is substantially enhanced. This process depends linearly on the photon flux
density [62]. Consequently, lower values of the photon flux density are also used
in EPM. It has been realized that correlated two-photon absorption dominates
over random two-photon absorption in the case of small values of photon-flux
density (below a critical photon flux density φc). If φc is sufficiently large, EPM
has a number of features rendering it superior to TPLSM.
5. A quantum state cannot be copied due to no cloning theorem (refer chapter
11). However, Alice can send qubit to Bob if the qubit is simultaneously erased
in Alice’s site. That is, a quantum state can be transformed from one place to
another but it cannot be copied from one pace to another. This is the principle
of quantum teleportation. It has been found that [45] using maximally entangled
state quantum teleportation can be done (refer sec. 15.5).
6. Quantum entanglement has led to development of many quantum technologies like
ghost images, entangled two-photon microscopy, quantum lithography, quantum
metrology which are all discussed extensively in chapter 15.Concluding Remarks 173
7. It is generally believed that entanglement plays a role in speeding-up of quantum
computation though there is no common agreement on the role of entanglement
in quantum computation. Entanglement is also found to be useful for reducing
the complexity of classical communication [63,64].
8. Entanglement is used in clock synchronization [65–67], frequency standard im￾provement [68] and in entanglement-assisted orientation in space [69].
9. Entanglement has also given new insights for understanding many physical
phenomena like super-radiance [70,71], superconductivity of disordered systems
[72,73] and quantum phase transition [74–76].
10. Entanglement can be utilized to produce states that permit to measure some
parameters while suppressing others. For example, to obtain a precise quadrupole
moment of, say, a 40Ca+ ion, we can perform spectroscopy on an entangled state
of couple of ions which depend on the quadrupole moment with insensitiveness
to fluctuations in the magnetic field [77].
7.10 Concluding Remarks
Though quantum entanglement is a new resource having potentials for many applications
which can never be done using any classical resource, it is quite complex and usually fragile
to the environment. It is really difficult to study both conceptually and mathematically
as it is endowed with rich structure. We have given only the basic ideas on the definition,
detection, quantification and some applications of quantum entanglement.
For more information on the different methods of detection of entanglement, one can
refer the review articles [6,12]. The ref. [6] reviews the various aspects of entanglement like
its characterization, detection, distillation, quantification, various manifestations of entan￾glement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses and quantum
cryptography. It also discusses the role of entanglement in quantum communication, ma￾nipulation of quantum entanglement, irreversebility, monogamy, entanglement decay and
entanglement in continuous variable systems. A review on the theory of entanglement mea￾sures is presented in [44].
Many criteria like reduction criterion, positive partial transpose positive maps, entan￾glement witnesses and criterion for qualitative characterization of bipartite quantum entan￾glement have been discuseed [78]. For more information on EoF and the related concepts
of concurrence one may refer [79]. An overview of the quantitative theory of entanglement
has been reported [80]. For a discussion on pictorial examples of entangled wave functions
one may refer to [82]. Undergratuate level laboratory experiments with entangled photons
have been discussed in the refs. [83–90].
Research on different aspects of quantum entanglement is very active as not only its
philosophical features are interesting but also it has very large potential for application in
every day life. The study of entanglement is pursued vigorously by scientific community
as it has been proved experimentally that entanglement lies at the heart of many future
quantum technologies.174 Quantum Entanglement

Quantum Decoherence
8.1 Introduction
Quantum coherence is concerned with the fact that objects have both wave- and particle-like
properties. When the wave nature of a particle got splitted into two then these two waves
interfere coherently with each other and form a single state. The resulting state is essen￾tially the superposition of the two states. How is it different from quantum entanglement?
Decoherence is considered as the loss of information from a system due to its coupling with
the surroundings. The study of decoherence was initially considered in statistical mechanics
as a result of interaction of the systems with environment. It entered into quantum theory
as a measuring instrument interacts with the system concerned in a measurement.
Quantum decoherence plays an important role in the interpretation of quantum me￾chanics. Decoherence is an important quantum phenomenon which has wide applications
both theoretical and experimental. Quantum decoherence helps to know the fundamental
reasons of understanding the very nature of quantum mechanics, the measurement process
and the boundary between quantum and classical behaviour. Decoherence brings a quan￾tum system into an apparant classical system. Decoherence is often thought that it will lead
to the solution of some of the fundamental questions in quantum mechanics, namely, the
measurement problem, the quantum to classical transition and also the quantum arrow of
time.
The quantum information processing fields like quantum computers, quantum commu￾nication and quantum cryptography depend very much on how to minimize and control the
quantum decoherence. In quantum mechanics the possible physical states ψ1, ψ2, . . . are
represented as vectors in a linear vector space called Hilbert space. A linear combination of
these wave functions will give a superposition state of the system which can also represent
the physical system. These wave functions evolve in time according to the Schr¨odinger equa￾tion in Schr¨odinger picture. But it is almost impossible to find such superposition states
for classical macroscopic systems. In other words, this description of quantum states do not
correspond to classical mechanical objects. For example, a quantum mechanical particle can
exist at many different positions simultaneously whereas a classical particle can exist only
at a particular position at a time.
The next important question to be answered is why the quantum mechanical system pre￾pared in a particular superposition state does not remain stable even for a very small time.
Why are the quantum states degraded almost instantaneously? The superposition states
must remain stable for a fairly longer time for processing quantum information using these
states. Quantum information processing and quantum technologies depend entirely on how
to generate, maintain and manipulate the superpsotion states.
The quantum state of a quantum particle is rarely completely isolated from its envi￾ronment. The quantum particle and the environment are bound together as one system.
A quantum particle invariably interacts with the environment. When the environment in￾teracts with a quantum state, the quantum state gets entangled with the classical degrees
DOI: 10.1201/9781003172192-8 179180 Quantum Decoherence
of freedon. The entanglement affects subsequent measurement of the quantum state as the
entangled state becomes a single state. We can say that decoherence describes how this
entanglement of the quantum state with the environment influences the results of subse￾quent measurements of the system. The interaction may be considered like a measurement
done on the quantum states by the environment. This enviroment may also be a man-made
measuring device. In this sense decoherence can be considered as an observation.
Schr¨odinger in 1935 found that there exists global states of composite systems that can￾not be written as a product of the states of the individual system, This phenomenon is
called entanglement [1]. Entanglement is purely a quantum phenomenon. As decoherence is
an entanglement of a quantum state with classical degrees of freedon, it is a quantum phe￾nomenon. Usually, the many degrees of freedom of the environment are not experimentally
controllable. Therefore, the entanglement is usually irreversible for all practical purposes.
We cannot reverse the interaction process to get back the initial interference components.
Decoherence is a highly efficient process which takes place too fast. But it is not an instan￾taneous discontinuous process. But new experimental techniques have been found to delay
decoherence by decoupling quantum particles from the environment.
We first explain the basic concept of decoherence and how it damps out quantum in￾terference of a superposition state in this chapter. Next, we discuss the master equations
which give the dynamical evolution of the quantum system and the environment entangled
state. Some of the decoherence models are discussed. A few experimental studies on deco￾herence are given. Finally, the role played by decoherence in the interpretation of quantum
mechanics and also in the transition of quantum state to classical are explained.
8.2 Decoherence and Interference Damping
A double-slit experiment can be used to explain the basic concept of decoherence. This
interference experiment when the interference pattern vanishes due to interaction with the
environment captures quite well the essence of what is happening in decoherence. The
decoherence effect is a mechanism destroying quantum interferences at a macroscopic level.
The double-slit experiment is a typical example of quantum interference which demonstrates
the dual nature of particles.
In the double-slit experiment, particles like electron, photon etc. behave some times like
a particle and some times like a wave. In the experimental set-up, a stream of particles is
incident on a double-slit separated by a small distance. The particles are detected on the
other side in a detector screen. We will observe an interference pattern on the screen as long
as the set-up is totally isolated, in the sense that no attempt is made either by an observer
or the environment, to determine which-path was taken by the particles. This is true even
if each particle in the beam is incident on the double-slit at a time separation between
them. The interference pattern disappears if a detection apparatus tries to determine the
path taken by each particle. Therefore, acquiring a particle’s path information destroys the
interference. It has also been observed that a total determination of the path information
destroys the interference pattern totally. A partial determination of the path information
reduces the visibility of the interference pattern partially.
In general, it is true that the interference pattern disappears when the observer acquires
information about the quantum system. What has really happened is that the information
obtained by the observer about the path of the particles has made the interference pattern
disappear and we will observe only two peaks on the screen as expected for a classical
system.Interaction of a Detector on the Double-Slit Experiment 181
As decoherence describes the emergence of classcial behaviour from quantum system
due to information leakage from the system, the deep relationship between interference and
information loss can be understood in the context of decoherence and the entanglement of
the quantum system with the environmental degrees of freedom. Decoherence is a statistical
concept involving a transition from a pure state to a mixture entangled states. Therefore,
the interference terms disappear.
8.3 Interaction of a Detector on the Double-Slit
Experiment
Following Maximilian Schlosshauer [2], we consider a double-slit experiment in which we
represent the quantum particle as a system S corresponding to the passage of the particle
through, say, slit-1 and slit-2 by |s1i and |s2i, respectively. Consider the environment or the
detector of the particles at the slits as the system E. Interaction of E with |s1i will give the
quantum state |E1i and with |s2i will give the quantum state |E2i for the quantum state
E. Hence, after the interaction of E at the two slits we will get the final composite state
|ψi = α|s1i|E1i + β|s2i|E2i. (8.1)
As |ψi is not a product state of S, (a1|s1i + a2|s2i), and E, (b1|E1i + b2|E2i), it is an
entangled state. Therefore, the interaction of the environment state E on S has given an
entangled composite state.
The reduced density matrix ρS
is defined as
ρS = TrE (ρSE ) = TrE|ψihψ|. (8.2)
TrE refers to partial trace with respect to E. The statistics of all possible measurements on
S are exhaustively encoded in the reduced density matrix ρS
. Finding the density operator
|ψihψ| and then taking the reduced density operation of the E subsystem and finally finding
its trace will give
ρS = |α|

where R.P.[F] is the real part of F and ψi(x) = hx|sii. The last term in Eq. (8.4) gives
the interference to the measurement of position probability at the screen after the beam
has gone through the two slits after interacting with the system E. hE2|E1i is the overlap
integral of the basis states of the system E. This overlap integral quantifies the visibility of
the interference pattern. If |E1i and |E2i are orthogonal then hE2|E1i = 0. The interference
term will become zero then.
If the two measurements at the slits are totally independent with no connection between
them then |E1i and |E2i are perfectly distinguishable. Under this perfect distinguishability182 Quantum Decoherence
the interference term in Eq. (8.4) will vanish as hE2|E1i = 0. Therefore, we get the position
probability on the screen as
p(x) = |α|

|ψ1(x)|
2 + |β|
2
|ψ2(x)|

. (8.5)
Equation (8.5) gives the classically expected distributions on the screen. By measuring
Eq. (8.5) on the screen we cannot determine locally the phase relationship between |s1i
and |s2i as the interference pattern has vanished. The coherence is between the states
|s1i|E1i and |s2i|E2i. Only a global measurement acting jointly on S and E can reveal
the coherence. As hE2|E1i can take values from 0 to 1 an interference pattern of reduced
visibility is obtained with a probability of p = 1 − |hE2|E1i|2
. Equation (8.4) shows that
the reduction of the visibility of the interference increases as |E1i and |E2i beccome more
distinguishable. What we discussed so far gives the essence of decoherence if we identify S
as an arbitrary quantum system interacting with the environment E.
Solved Problem 1:
Show that the state given by Eq. (8.1) is an entangled state for α and β not equal to zero.
For the given |ψi the determinant of the coefficient of the state is

β are not zero the determinant of the coefficient is not zero. That is, |ψi is an entangled
state.
8.4 Decoherence Due to Phase Randomization
The details of decoherence is, in general, quite complicated. John King Gamble and John
F. Lindner [3] have given a very simple thought experiment using a phase randomizer in a
Stern–Gerlach apparatus to explain how a random environmental interaction leads to the
classical result.
Consider a Stern–Gerlach experimental set-up with a source of spin-half neutral silver
atoms. The state vector of spin-half state can be given as
|ψi = α| ↑i + β| ↓i. (8.6)

the exercise 2 at the end of this chapter). Therefore, rx, ry and rz can be written as a unit
vector r in spherical polar coordinates with
rx = sin θ cos φ, ry = sin θ sin φ, rz = cos θ. (8.13)
Gamble and Lindner considered a silver furnace connected to an angle control device,
which polarizes the spin of the out-going copper atom with x − y plane. The angle φ is
under the control of the user. As z = 0 for x−y plane, θ = π/2. This atom passes through a
Stern–Gerlach analyzer after a random phase φR to the atom’s original phase φ introduced
by a classical roulette wheel. This phase randomizer crudely models the environmental
interaction on the spin states of the atoms. The schematic of the thought experiment is
given in Fig. 8.1.
Let us first consider the measurement result in the absence of the phase randomizer. As
θ = π/2, Eq. (8.13) gives
rx = cos φ, ry = sin φ, rz = 0. (8.14)

The detector measures the closeness of the alignment of the silver atoms with the magnetic
field gradient. When φ = 0 the spin of the atom points in the x-direction. As the magnetic
field is perpendicular to x-direction, half of the measurement of spin will give ~/2 and
another half of the measurement will give −~/2. The average value of the magnetic moment
will be zero. For φ = π/2, the spin points in the field direction y. So, the measurement will
give ~/2 always. For φ = 3π/2 the spin direction will be opposite to the field direction giving
the magnetic moment −~/2. This bechaviour is the characteristic of a coherence quantum
superposition and a non-diagonal static operator.
The classical roulette wheel is imagined to add a random phase φR to the original spin
angle φ of the atom. Therefore, the atom will have a new phase angle. This set-up minimizes
the environmental interaction to the pure spin state of the atom. φR will take any random
value between 0 to 2π. Therefore, the new phase angle of the atom becomes φ
0 = φ + φR.
To calculate the expectation value hOiR of the spin observable O with the random phase
we must find the new density matrix ρR

The final measurement with the random phase gives an average value of zero irrespective of
the initial φ values. Thus, half number of measurements give ~/2 and another half number of
measurements give −~/2. This is expected from a classical mixture of spin-up and spin-down
atoms.
We find that the inclusion of the random phase (assumed to be an environmental inter￾action) to the spin state of the atom has changed the density matrix ρ to ρR
. The interaction
has effectively destroyed the off-diagonal elements in ρ while leaving the diagonal elements
intact. The loss of the off-diagonal elements in ρ has resulted in the loss of the sinusoidal
pattern and is a quantum effect. Therefore, we can conclude that the loss of off-diagonal
elements in the density matrix is the hallmark of a loss of quantum information due to an
environmental interaction and it leads to the emergence of the classical world [4].Position Decoherence Due to Environmental Scattering 185
8.5 Position Decoherence Due to Environmental
Scattering
As an another example for explaining how decoherence theory demonstrates an environ￾mental interaction leading to an entanglement and decaying of the interferance term we
provide Lerner model [5] of positional decoherence in a gas of scatterers.
If a state of a particle localized in position X is given by |φXi then it has a classical
counterpart. On the other hand, supppose we have a quantum mechanical superposition
state |φi = (|φXi + |φY i)/
√
2 in which the particle is appeared to be localized at both
X and Y positions simultaneously. In this case |φi has no classical counter part. The ex￾pectation value of our observable hφ|A|φi contains the interference term hφY |A|φXi. The
measurements thus lead to non-classical nature of |φi. Lerner has shown how the action of a
gas of scatteres on a macroscopic particle via the Schr¨odinger equation leads to the approx￾imately exponential decay of the interference term hφY |A|φXi using a simplified scattering
model.
Let |φXi represent a particle state with a center of mass at X corresponding to the posi￾tional wave function φX(y) = hy|φXi. Let |φi represent the state of each of the surrounded
gas scatterers with the corresponding position wave function φ(x) = hx|φi. Consider the
scattering to be one-dimensional and the particle is very heavy compared to the gas scat￾terers. In that case, the scattering can be considered as an elastic reflection at an infinite
potential at x = X with the momentum of the scatterer changing from p to −p and a
possible translation of x → a − x. As the potential is infinite at x = X the wave function
at x must be zero: φ(X) − φ(a − X) = 0 and a = 2X. Hence, the scattering changes
φX(y)φ(x)
S
−→ −φX(y)φ(2X − x). (8.20)
We can write the superposition of two orthogonal states centred at two different positions
X and Y as
Φ(x, y) = 1
√
2
[φX(y) + φY (y)] φ(x). (8.21)
Combining Eqs. (8.20) and (8.21), we obtain the scattered superposition state as
[φX(y) + φY (y)] φ(x)
S
−→ −φX(y)φ(2X − x) − φY (y)φ(2Y − x). (8.22)
The function φ(x) entangles the scatterer and the particle states and leads to decoherence
of the superposition state of the particle. The expectation value of a Hermitian operator A
is given by
hΦ|A|Φi =
1
2
[hφX|A|φXi + hφY |A|φY i + hφY |A|φXi + hφX|A|φY i] . (8.23)
The terms r = hφY |A|φXi and r
∗ = hφX|A|φY i are the two interference terms giving the
quantum mechanical characteristics of the phase coherence of the superposition state. Ab￾sence of these states will lead to classical states. Lerner has shown that the expectation value
of this interference term r tends to zero in the presence of scattering when the expectation
value does not depend on |φi. Due to scattering we find from Eq. (8.22)

8.6 Master Equations
No quantum mechanical system is closed. Any practical quantum system has an uncon￾trollable coupling to the environment which influences the time evolution of the system.
It is not a simple task to describe the behaviour of open quantum systems theoretically.
As a complete description of the environmental degrees of freedom is not feasible, theory
of open quantum systems are developed by considering different assumptions about the
environments and their interactions. The effective equation of motion which describes the
evolution of the quantum system S and the environment E is called the master equation.
8.6.1 Liouville–von Neumann Equation
We will first discuss how a closed system evolves with time t. If ψ(t) is a pure state then
the time evolution of ψ(t) is given by the Schr¨odinger equation (~ = 1)
i
d
dt
|ψ(t)i = H(t)|ψ(t)i. (8.32)
If |ψ(t0)i is its initial state then
|ψ(t)i = U(t, t0)|ψ(t0)i, U(t0, t0) = 1. (8.33)
For an isolated system there is no interaction. Hence, the Hamiltonian H will be independent
of time. Then we get from Eq. (8.32) |ψ(t)i = Ce
−iHt. For t = t0 we have |ψ(t0)i = Ce
−iHt0
.
Then
|ψ(t)i = e−iH(t−t0)
|ψ(t0)i. (8.34)
Comparison of Eq. (8.34) with (8.33) gives
U(t, t0) = e−iH(t−t0)
. (8.35)
If the system is an ensemble of states then to find its evolution with time we must find its
density matrix
ρ(t0) = X
n
an|ψn(t0)ihψn(t0)|. (8.36)
Then its equation of motion is (see the exercise 7 at the end of this chapter)
d
dt
ρ(t) = −i [H, ρ(t)] . (8.37)188 Quantum Decoherence
This equation is called Liouville–von Neumann equation.
We could write the equation of motion for a closed system by Eqs. (8.33) and (8.37) as
the states representing a closed systems evolve unitarily. In an open system the interaction
of the environment with the quantum state implies that the states representing such systems
do not evolve unitarily. The open system cannot be described by the Schr¨odinger equation
as it describes a unitary evolution.
If S represents the quantum system and E the environment then the interaction between
these two systems generates a certain correlation between them that is responsible for non￾unitary character of the open system. In order to desribe the temporal evolution of an
open quantum system first the equation for the unitary temporal evolution of the overall
system S and E is written and the environmental coordinates are eliminated by taking a
partial trace of the overall density matrix. Then we will get the equation for the reduced
density operator which is called a generalized master equation [6]. Use of taking partial
traces to eliminate environmetnal coordinates and deriving the generalized master equation
was developed by many researchers [7]. These works added a second term to the Liouville–
von Neumann Eq. (8.37). This term describes the damping or energy dissipation of the open
object system.
8.6.2 Markovian Master Equations
Let us consider the quantum state S in the state |φi in Hilbert space HS spanned by
the basis {|φj i} and the environment state in state |Ei in Hilbert space HE with the basis
{|Ej i}. The joint Hilbert space of the system S and the environment E is the tensor product
of space HS ⊗ HE and the full Hamiltonian can be written as [8]
H = HS ⊗ IE + IS ⊗ HE + HI , (8.38)
where IE and IS are the unit operators in the Hilbert spaces HE and HS, respectively,
and HI is the Hamiltonian giving the interaction between S and E. HS and HE are the
Hamiltonains of the quantum system S and the environmental system E, respectively. The
system and environment together will evolve according to the Schr¨odinger equation. Due to
the interaction Hamiltonian HI the initial product terms |φi ⊗ |Ei will evolve into states
that cannot be written as product states. |φi ⊗ |Ei will evolve into |ψi where
|ψi =
X
j
aj |φj i ⊗ |Ej i. (8.39)
We get an entangled state due to the environmental interaction HI with the quantum state
S. As the system S and the environment E are now entangled, neither the state nor the
environment has pure state. The joint density of the state ρSE = |ψihψ| is constructed.
From ρSE the density of the state ρS
for the quantum system can be found by taking the
partial trace of ρSE over the environmental degrees of freedom as
ρS
(t) = TrρSE (t). (8.40)
As the composite system evolves according to the Schr¨odinger equation we can write
(taking t0 = 0)
|ψ(t)i = U(t)|ψ(0)i, (8.41)
where U(t) is the time evoltuion operator for the composite system. Then we get
ρSE = |ψihψ| = U(t)|ψ(0)ihψ(0)|U
† = U(t)ρSE (0)U
†
. (8.42)Master Equations 189
From Eq. (8.40), we obtain
ρS
(t) = TrEρSE (t) = TrE

U(t)ρSE (0)U
†

. (8.43)
The evolution of Eq. (8.41) requires calculating the exact dynamics of the system and
environment. The reduced density matrix depends on the entire past history of the full
system-environment state. Therefore, solving it is quite difficult without certain assumptions
and simplifications of the equation. As we are usually not interested in the dynamics of the
environment the calculation of the full composite system-environment state is not needed.
To simplify the computation of Eq. (8.43) master equations are based on certain assumptions
and simplifications. Consequently, these assumptions lead to an approximate description of
the decoherence process. One such approximate master equations are the Markovian master
equations
∂
∂tρS
(t) = LρS
(t), (8.44)
where the super-operator L does not depend on time or the initial preparation of the state.
Hence, such master equations are local in time and LρS
(t) does not depend on the history
of density matrix.
8.6.3 Born–Markov Master Equations
Born–Markov master equations are relatively easy to solve. They are found to be good
approximations to many cases of practical interest and their solutions agree well with ex￾perimental result. They are based on the following two approximations [2].
1. The Born Approximation
It assumes that the system-environment coupling is very weak and hence there is
only a negligible change in ρE . The system-environment density operator can be
assumed to be ρSE ≈ ρS
(t) ⊗ ρE at all times.
2. The Markov Approximation
Denote τr as the relaxation time of the open system describing the time on which
the environment affects the evolution of the system. τc is the time scale for the
decay of correlations between the degrees of the environment that are being gen￾erated by the interaction with the quantum system. Assume that τr  τc. There￾fore, the environment may be considered to be memory-less as it does not retain
information over a long time.
In many cases of practical interest HI in Eq. (8.38) dominates we can write H ≈ HI .
Let us choose the states |φii such that the composite system-environment state, starting
from the product state |φii|E0i at t = 0 remains in the product state |φii|E(t)i for all the
time under the interaction HI . Then it can be proved that HI takes the tensor product of
the form HI = S ⊗ E, where S and E are system and environment observables. Then the
environment-super selected observables will be those commuting with S [2]. Any HI can
then be written as a diagonal decomposition of the system operators (Si) and environmental
operators (Ei) as
HI =
X
i
Si ⊗ Ei
. (8.45)
Then the Born–Markov master equation is obtained as [9,10]

gives the environmental self-correction functions which has a rapid decay in Markov ap￾proximation. In many situations of interest Born–Markov master equation gets simplified.
8.6.4 Lindblad Master Equation
The Lindblad master equation is a special case of the general Born–Markov master equation
that ensures complete positivity [11]. The evolution may not be unitary. But it must take
density matrices at t = 0 to density matrices at t, but not necessarily pure states to pure
states. The general form of Lindblad master equation is given by [12,13]

processes. The matrix Γ = [γij ] is positive. So, all its eigenvalues Kµ are ≥ 0. Diagonalizing
Γ, the diagonal form of Eq. (8.49) is obtained as [13,14]

where the Lindbald operators Lµ are linear combinations of the system operators Si with
coefficients determined by the diagonalization of Γ. Lindbald operators do not always cor￾respond to physically observables as Si are not necessarily Hermitian. When Lµ correspond

Show that Eq. (8.50) reduces to Eq. (8.51) if Lµ operators correspond to physically observ￾ables. Show that if [Si

= Lµ [Lµ, ρS

= [Lµ, [Lµ, ρS

Thus, Eq. (8.50) reduces to Eq. (8.51).
Next, Lµ is a linear combination of Si
. As [Si
, ρS
(t)] = 0 for all i and t we get [Lµ, ρS
] = 0
for all t. In Eq. (8.51) the decoherence term [Lµ, [Lµ, ρS
(t)]] = 0. So, the eigenstates of Si
are not affected by decoherence.
8.7 Decoherence Models
We have seen that decoherence of a quantum system arises due to its interaction with en￾vironment. Therefore, different decoherence models arise from the ways of representing the
quantum systems and the environment. In many situations the physical systems can be
represented by a qubit if the state space is discrete and two-dimensional. If the physical
system is a particle then it can be described by continuous phase space coordinates. Envi￾ronments can be modelled as a collection of harmonic oscillators or qubits. At low energies
and for weak interactions the environment can be represented by one or two coordinates of
the system coupled linearly to an environment of harmonic oscillator [15]. At low temper￾ature environmental interactions arise due to paramagnetic spin, paramagnetic impurities,
defects, tunnelling charges and nuclear spins. So, such environments can be represented
by qubits. As spin- 1
2
particle states are represented by qubits we call the models repre￾senting the environments by qubits as spin-environment models. Generally, there are four
imporatant models [2].
8.7.1 Collisional Decoherence Model
In the collisional decoherence model, a massive free quantum particle scatters environmental
particles. The environmental particles like photons or gas molecules are scattered by the
massive quantum particles. Collisional decoherence arises as the scattered particles obtain
which-path information about the quantum particle. Joos and Zeh [16] studied first the
collisional decoherence models. A more rigorous derivation of the master equation was given
in [17]. In these models the quantum particles do not recoil as their masses are considered
to be very large compared to the masses of the environmental particles. In situations where
the mass of the quantum particle is comparable to the mass of the environmental particle,
the no-recoil assumption cannot be considered. For such cases more general models for
collisional decoherence have been developed by introducing dissipation terms in master
equations [2].
8.7.2 Quantum Brownian Model
Another extensively studied model of decoherence is knwon as quantum Brownian model.
It considers one-dimensional motion of a particle weakly coupled to a thermal bath of192 Quantum Decoherence
non-interacting harmonic oscillators. The environmental Hamiltonian is given by
HE =

, (8.53)
where qi
, pi are the canonical position and momentum operators and mi
, ωi are the mass
and natural frequency of the ith oscillator, respectively. The interaction Hamiltonian HI is
chosen as HI = x ⊗
P
i Ciqi
, where x is the system position and Ci
is the coupling of the
quantum system with the ith environmental oscillator.
8.7.3 Spin-Boson Models
In the spin-boson models, the quantum system is represented by qubits and the environment
by collision of harmonic oscillators. This model was a very important model of decoherence
studies in the early years of quantum information. This model finds wide applications as
many quantum systems can be represented by a two level system. In a simplified spin-boson
model the system Hamiltonian is given by
HS =
1
2
~ω0σz. (8.54)
In the most general case a tunnelling term 1
2
~∆0σx will be included. The environmental
Hamiltonian is given by Eq. (8.53) and the interaction Hamiltonian is HI = σz ⊗
P
i Ciqi
.
Then the total Hamiltonian becomes
H =

(8.55)
with [ai
, a
†
j
] = δij . The zero-point energy part in harmonic oscillator term has been dropped.
As H commutes with σz there will be no transition between |0i and |1i states of the quantum
system. Consequently, no energy is exchanged between the system and environment. Hence,
this model describes decoherence without dissipation.
8.7.4 Spin-Spin Model
The fourth important decoherence model is the spin-spin model in which the system qubit
couples linearly with a collection of the qubits representing the environment. A basic spin￾spin model was sutied in [18]. The interaction Hamiltonian with the inclusion of the tun￾nelling term is

The interaction Hamiltonian describes a bilinear coupling between the system and environ￾ment spins.
For the master equations, their solutions, decoherence rates and other refinements of
these models one may refer to the ref. [2].
8.8 Decoherence Experiments
Though the consequences of decoherence can be experimentally observed, experimental
studies of decoherence face many challenges [2]. We have to prepare first a quantum systemDecoherence Experiments 193

in a superposition of mesoscopically or even macroscopic distinguishgable states. Next, the
decoherence time must be sufficiently large so that the gradual action of decoherence can
be resolved. Any monitoring of decoherence should not introduce any significant unwanted
decoherence. We must be able to control the strength and form of the environmental in￾teraction with the quantum system. Many decoherence experiments have been performed
using cavity QED [19], mesoscopic molecules [20], SQUIDs and Cooper-pair boxes [21] and
Bose-Einstein condensates [22].
8.8.1 Cavity QED Experiments
In cavity QED type of decoherence experiments an atom interacts with the electromagnetic
field inside a cavity producing an atom-field entangled state. A measurement of atomic state
then disentangles the atom-field state and produces a superposition of two coherence field
states. This superposition state is monitored for decoherence over time.
In an experiment a rubidium atom in upper state |ui and lower state |gi corresponding to
two circular Rydberg states was prepared [23]. It was done using a π/2 pulse in a microwave
cavity R1 at a frequency ν very close to the resonance frequency of the two energy levels.
Next, the atom enters a cavity C with long damping time. It contains a radiation field of a
few photons represented by the coherent state

is equal to the mean number ¯n of photons. Figure 8.2 gives the schematic illustration
of the cavity experiment [23].
The interaction between the atom and field is so tuned that there is no energy transfer
between |gi and |ui states but a phase shift of χ is introduced to the coherent state |αi as
|e
iχαi if the atom is in |ui state and a phase shift of −χ is introduced to |αi state as |e
−iχαi
if the atom is in |gi state. So, for a superposition state of the atom (|gi + |ui)/

the entangled state as

Energy measurement will collapse Eq. (8.59) into either |ui or |gi destroying the entan￾glement between atom and photon field. If the state |gi (|ui) is measured then the field will

For the two coherent states |αi and |βi we have |hα|βi|2 = e−|α−β|

Equation (8.61) gives the catness of the superposition |±i and it measures the degree to
which the components |αe

−iχi represent mesoscopically or macroscopic distin￾guishable states [2]. The overlap depends on χ and ¯n and decreases exponentially with ¯n.

with ¯n = 10. This gives overlap e−2|α|

.
It has also been observed that the decoherence of the field supeposition |±i left behind
by sending a second rubidium atom in the cavity C. The second atom will be found in the
same state (|gi or |ui) provided the superposition has not been decohered. In that case the
conditional detection probability Puu or Pgg will be one. If the field has started to decohere
then Puu or Pgg will decrease, reaching the value 1/2 for complete decoherence. By sending
the second atom with a time-delay τ the progressive decoherence of a superposition of the
two coherence field states as a function of τ was also studied. In an another cavity-QED
experiment [24] the field states inside the cavity were reconstructed at different stages of
their gradual decoherence.
8.8.2 Matter-Wave Interferometry
Matter-wave interferometry experiments are based on Talbot effect, a diffraction effect first
noticed by Henry Fox Talbot in 1836. In this effect a plane wave incident on a diffraction
grating creates images of the grating at multiples of Talbot length Lλ = d
2/λ behind the
grating. λ is the wave length of the incident wave and d is the grating spacing. Spatial
interference fringes have been demonstrated for mesoscopic molecules C60, C70 fullerenes
and for large molecular clusters [25–27]. As the molecular beams are uncollimated and
incoherent the experiment set-up makes use of three gratings with grating spacing of d,
placed at distances Lλ one behind the other [28]. The first grating produces transverse
coherence of the molecular beam of sufficient quality for the second grating to produce a
diffraction pattern on the third grating. The thrid grating can be moved perpendicular to
the incident direction of the beam and scan the diffraction pattern. A laser beam ionizes
the molecules coming out of the third grating and the ionized molecules are detected by
an ion detector. By scanning the third grating the interference of the beam can be studied
from the detector outThe Role of Decoherence in the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics 195
Matter-wave interferometry has been used to study the important decoherences, namely,
collisional decoherence and thermal decoherence. To study the collisional decoherence a
background gas of adjustable pressure was introduced to interact with the molecule of the
beam. Scattering of gas molecules by the molecule of the beam creates entanglement. So, the
which-way information of the interfering molecular beam is performed by the gas molecule
resulting in the reducing of the visibility of the fringes. An increase of the pressure of the
gas increases scattering. Therefore, the visibility is found to fall with increase of pressure
[29]. To study the thermal decoherence the molecules of the beam are heated using a laser
beam. As the photons emitted by the heated molecules carry away which-way information
the fringe visibility is reduced. As the heating power of the laser beam is increased the
visibility is found to decrease [30].
8.8.3 Decoherence Studies Using SQUIDs
A SQUID consists of a ring of superconducting material in which a thin layer of an insulating
barrier is introduced. Such a junction is called Josephson junction. Quantum mechanical
tunnelling of Cooper pairs through the junction leads to a resistance-free supercurrent
around the loop. The two possible direction of the supercurrent can be represented by the
two basis states {|i, |	i}. By adjusting an external field the two lowest-lying energy states
|1i and |0i can be represented as superposition of |i and |	i with equal weight as
|0i =
1
√
2
(|i + |	i), |1i =
1
√
2
(|	i − |i). (8.62)
The decoherence of these superposition states was measured using Ramsey interferometry
[31].
Two consecutive microwave pulses are applied with a delay-time τ during which the
system evolves freely. After the second pulse the relative amplitude of the superposition of
|i and |	i exhibits an oscillatory dependence of τ . Measurement over a range of delay-time
gives the occupation probabilities for |i and |i states as a function of τ . It is found that
the envelope of the oscillation is damped due to decoherence acting on the system during
the free evolution interval τ . From the decay envelope we can determine the decoherence
time.
A few other systems existing and have potential to be developed for the observation of
decoherence are discussed in ref. [2]. They make use of ion traps, quantum dots, mechanical
quantum resonantors and Bose-Einstein condensates.
8.9 The Role of Decoherence in the Interpretation of Quantum
Mechanics
It is generally claimed by many physicists that decoherence is needed to explain the mea￾surement problem of quantum mechanics and also for explaining the emergence of classical
world from quantum mechanics. We will first discuss what is meant by measurement prob￾lem in quantum mechanics.
8.9.1 The Measurement Problem of Quantum Mechanics
Schr¨odinger equation describes the linear, unitary, deterministic evolution of the state func￾tion |ψi. |ψi is a vector in Hilbert space. The Hilbert space is spanned by eigenvectors of196 Quantum Decoherence
the Hamiltonian operator. For example, for a spin- 1
2
particle we have a two-dimensional
Hilbert space with spin-up |1i and spin-down |0i states spanning the Hilbert space. As
the Schr¨odinger equation is a linear equation a general state of the particle |ψi is written
as a superposition state as |ψi = α|1i + β|0i, where |α|
2 + |β|
2 = 1 and hψ|ψi = 1. For
any quantum mechanical system with N eigenfuctions {|φii} of an observable we can write
|ψi =
P
i
ai
|φii.
All observable quantities are represented by self-adjoint operators. In the conventional
interpretation of quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement of some
observables are the eigenvalues of the operators. If O|φii = γi
|φii for an operator O then
the measurement of O will gives

Since |ai

2 gives the probability of getting γi we find that the measurement will give any

2
. This is called the Born
probability rule. According to this rule when a measurement is made the wave function
|ψi is projected to one of its bases vector |φii corresponding to the actual measurement
outcomes γi
. Before the measurement |ψi evolves unitarily and deterministically according
to the Schr¨odinger equation. When a measurement is done, it collapses to one of its bases
vectors stochastically. This is essentially the measurement problem of quantum mechan￾ics: the question of how to reconcile the linear and deterministic evolution described by
the Schr¨odinger equation with our observation of the occurrence of random measurement
outcomes [2].
8.9.2 Explanation of Problematic Differences in the Classical and
Quantum Measurements
In the Schro¨dinger cat thought experiment Born interpretation says that the death or
survival of the cat happened instantaneously at the moment the box was opened and the
measurement was made. But classically the radioactive source would have emitted a particle
any time before opening of the box, broken the poison bottle and killed the cat. This
explains why there are problematic differences in information that we get from classical
measurements and quantum measurements. In short, one can say that the measurement
problem arises due to the superposition of wave function in quantum mechanics and no such
superposition is observed in classical situations. The superposition in quantum mechanics
leads to interference terms which are absent in classical states.
8.9.3 Can the Decoherence Theory Solve the Measurement Problem?
As decoherence suppresses the interference terms it was believed that decoherence can solve
the measurement problem of quantum mechanics. But S¨ussmann [32] explained the formal
distinction between decoherence and wave function collapse. Decoherence is a statistical
concept involving the transition from a pure state to a mixture state and the disappear-The Role of Decoherence in the Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics 197
ance of the interference terms. A collapse refers to transition from a pure state to another
pure state. It has been argued [2,9] that decoherence is not tied to any interpretation of
quantum mechanics. Decoherence theory relies on reduced density matrix whose formalism
and interpretation are based on the collapse postulates and Born’s rule. So, decoherence
theory cannot solve the measurement problem. However, certain interpretations of quantum
mechanics are in need of decoherence for defining their structure.
8.9.4 Emergence of Classical World From Quantum Systems
Next, we will discuss how decoherence can explain emergence of classical world from quan￾tum systems. Generally, the microscopic systems are consiered as quantum systems and
macroscopic objects obey classical laws. To distinguish quantum and classical systems based
on their size is not correct as there are many macroscopic quantum phenomena like super￾conductivity, superfluidity, quantum Hall effect, polaritons, nonclassical squeezed states of
suitably prepared electromagnetic fields with macroscopic number of photons, Bose-Einstein
condensates etc. We can find the correspondence of quantum mechanics to classical me￾chanics through Hamilton–Jacobi equation, Ehrenfest’s principle, the similarity of quantum
commutators to Poisson brackets. Still it is quite not clear how does a quantum system
described by a vector in Hilbert space goes into a classical system described in phase space.
A classical system is specified by giving values to some small set of numbers such as posi￾tion, momentum, mass, charge, energy etc. Quantum mechanically the system is described
by a vector in Hilbert space which will be a superposition of eigenfunctions of an observ￾able. In quantum mechanics superposition of states lead to interference terms. As no such
superposition state exists in classical system no interference can be observed for classical
particles.
Studies of decoherence in [33,34] consider the emergence of classicality from a quantum
world. We have seen that decoherence theory describes interaction between a quantum sys￾tem and its environment which leads to the superposition of quantum interference. Thus,
decoherence is regarded as an indirect measurement process that creates a set of pointer
states which are eigenstates of the observable of the measuring instrument and they rep￾resent the possible positions of the display pointer of the instrument. These pointer states
don’t show any interference. So, decoherence can be considered to explain how classicality
emerges from a quantum world.
8.9.5 Quantum Darwinism
Quantum Darwinism is an idea put forwarded by Wojciech Hubert Zurek [35]. It describes
the transition from the quantum to classical world using a quantum process in which only
certain states are chosen in the interaction of the quantum system with environment as they
survive better than others in a particular environment. We can observe on macroscopic scale
only those quantum states which are able to survive interaction with the environment. In
quantum Darwinism the quantum system with a vast number of potential superposition
states evolves into some final states, pointer states [36] via a selective process performed
on the system through continuous interaction with the environment. Pointer states can be
observed classically. One of the drawbacks of quantum Darwinism is that it does not answer
to the question of what the physical process repsonsible for the transition from quantum to
classical possible.198 Quantum Decoherence
8.10 Concluding Remarks
The wave function |ψi is written as a superposition of basis states in Hilbert space. The prob￾ability density defined as |ψ|
2 has interference terms in addition to the classical probability
density terms. Therefore, we say that the wave function is in a coherent superposition.
Decoherence arises due to the interaction of the quantum system with the environment.
Vanishing of interference term due to decoherence leads to classical probabilities. We have
given a few examples where the interactions with environments make the interference terms
vanishing.
A consequence of decoherence is that a quantum system looses its quantum behaviour
due to its interaction with an environment. Interaction leads to transfer of information
from the system to the environment. After the interaction coherence of the superposed
state is lost. Interaction makes the system and environment entangled joint state which
can no longer be separable. Decoherence problems are treated mathematically using master
equations which describe the time evolution of reduced density matrix. We have discussed
Born-Markov master equations and Lindblad master equations. They are used to study
many realistic models of decoherence processess. A few experimental stuides on the action
of decoherence in a realistic interaction of quantum system with an environment have been
discussed.
A brief account of the role of decoherence in the interpretation of quantum mechanics
has been given. Decoherence plays significant roles in explaining the quantum measure￾ment problem and the transition to quantum state to classical state. However, it cannot
completely explain them. Study of decoherence phenomenon is very important for the field
of quantum information processing. Decoherence has to be minimized to perform quan￾tum computation. Controlled decoherence can do quantum error correction in a quantum
communication channel.

Quantum Computers
9.1 Introduction
Present day computers perform computations using two-state binary logic. They led to an
amazing revolution in data manipulation and processing. The components of a computer
are subject to various laws of physics. What will happen if the components of a computer
become very small such that they are subjected to the principles of quantum mechanics?
Alternatively, can a real quantum system be used to build a computer functioning in the
quantum mechanical regime? This is one of the major issues in quantum computing. The
name quantum computing refers to calculations using logic based on the probability ampli￾tude concept.
Classical computers of the present decade are able to answer one question at a time.
In contrast a quantum computer will have the ability to carry out more than one problem
simultaneously. Essentially, quantum computers manipulate quantum states instead of clas￾sical bits. In a quantum computer the eigenstates of, for example, a two-level system are
renamed 0 and 1. Now, the two level quantum system becomes a qubit (that is, quantum
binary digit) [1–4]. The concept of the quantum computer was introduced first by Paul
Anthony Benioff (1980) [5]. Richard Feynman [6,7] contributed to the early development
of quantum computation. The first paper on quantum computing was published by David
Deutsch [8] in the year 1985.
During the past one decade or so, many quantum algorithms have emerged. Among them
the most remarkable successes of quantum computation are Shor’s efficient algorithms for
integer factorization and the computation of discrete logarithms [9,10]. Peter Williston Shor
has shown that quantum computers would solve the problem of finding discrete logarithms
(mod N). He predicted that a quantum computer can perform prime factoring in polynomial
time: t ∝ k
p
, where p is a constant and k is the number of bits in the number to be factored.
For this problem a classical computer is believed to take eck1/3
time, where c is a constant.
Shor’s breakthrough created an avalanche of research activity in quantum computation
and quantum information theory. In addition to Shor’s factorization algorithm, Deutsch–
(Richard)Jozsa algorithm [8,11] and Lov Kumar Grover’s rapid search algorithm [12] are
capable of performing certain computational tasks exponentially faster compared to their
classical counterparts. In the present chapter, we discuss the basic aspects of quantum
computing.
9.2 What is a Quantum Computer?
In a classical information theory ‘bit’ is an indivisible unit. It takes the values such as yes or
no, true or false or simply 0 or 1. A sequence of bits is used to represent classical information.

In a classical computer, logical gates are employed to evaluate Boolean functions of a set of
input bits.
9.2.1 Qubits
Quantum information can be represented by the elementary units called quantum bits ab￾breviated as qubits or qbits. A qubit is two levels of a quantum system (like the spin of an
electron). For example, spin-up, | ↑i, represents 1 (true) and spin-down, | ↓i, represents 0
(false). Note that | ↑i to | ↓i can be achieved by a magnetic field and dissipates no heat. All
information can be encoded into a sequence of qubits. In principle, any two-state system
can be used as a quantum bit. Some examples are presented in table 9.1.
What is the difference between a classical bit and a qubit? A qubit can be in a state
other than |0i and |1i. It is possible to form a combination of states called superposition
states given by |ψi = α|0i + β|1i. Denoting |0i =

1
0

and |1i =

0
1

the quantum
state |ψi is written in vector notation as 
α
β

. For example, we can represent the spin
of an electron in the horizontal direction as the sum of the up and down states. When we
measure a qubit, the result will be either 0 with probability |α|
2 or 1 with probability |β|
2
.
Hence, |α|
2 + |β|
2 = 1. A classical bit has either 0 state or 1 state whereas a qubit can exist
between |0i and |1i until it is observed.
|ψ1i ⊗ |ψ2i denotes tensor product of |ψ1i and |ψ2i. If |ψ1i =

If |ψ1i = a|0i + b|1i and |ψ2i = c|0i + d|1i then
|ψ1i ⊗ |ψ2i = |ψ1ψ2i
= ac|0i|0i + ad|0i|1i + bc|1i|0i + bd|1i|1i
= ac|00i + ad|01i + bc|10i + bd|11i. (9.2)What is a Quantum Computer? 203
Multiple bits have more states. With two classical bits 0 and 1 there are four possible
states 00, 01, 10, 11. But a general two qubit system is
|ψi = α00|00i + α01|01i + α10|10i + α11|11i (9.3)
with P|αx|
2 = 1, where x = 00, 01, 10, 11.
As infinite range of values of α and β are possible with |α|
2 + |β|
2 = 1, in principle a
qubit can store an infinite amount of data. But this is misleading because a measurement of
the qubit changes its state to yield either 0 or 1. Measurement collapses the state of qubit
from the superposition of |0i and |1i to |0i with a probability |α|
2 or |1i with probability
|β|
2
. So, from a measurement we can obtain only a single bit of information about the
qubit’s state. Only if infinitely many identical qubits are prepared and then measurements
are performed we can determine α and β. As no quantum state can be copied because such
an act will lead to the collapse of the superposition state into one of its constituent state, it
is impossible to set-up identical states. Hence, in principle, it is impossible to find α and β
exactly. The information contained in a qubit is enormous if we do not measure it. That is,
nature conceals a great deal of information. This hidden quantum information falls at the
center of what makes quantum mechanics a powerful modern emerging tool for information
processing.

9.2.2 Quantum Gates
An elementary quantum logic gate is a unitary transformation. A quantum gate acts on
a qubit or pair of qubits. Quantum gates are represented by matrices or operators. Any
unitary matrix can specify a valid gate. We can represent them in Dirac notation also. 204 Quantum Computers
quantum computers a unitary transformation is applied to a given initial state of a set
of qubits through several quantum gates. The final outcome of a quantum computation is
contained in the final state of the qubits.
There are certain major differences between classical and quantum gates.
1. Fan-in1
is not possible in quantum circuits.
2. In classical circuits wires are joined together to form a single wire. In quantum
circuits this irreversible operation is not possible.
3. Fan-out2
is also not possible. That is, making a number of copies of a bit is not
possible.
4. Quantum gates do not permit feedback loops from one part of the circuit to
another part.
9.2.3 Quantum Computer
Quantum computation is defined as an arbitrary transformation on a Hilbert space spanned
by the complete set of all possible states of bits. The difference between quantum computers
and a system of interacting spins is that the computation must be modular, each logical
operation considers only a few spins. Essentially, quantum computers will perform compu￾tations at the atomic scale.
In a quantum computer, the execution of a program can be thought of as a dynamical
process and is governed by the Schr¨odinger equation. Consequently, a state vector ψ is used
to describe the state of the computer. Here ψ is a linear superposition of all the binary
states of the bits xm ∈ {0, 1}:
ψ(t) = X
xm∈{0,1}
αx |x1, x2, . . . , xmi ,
X
x
|αx|
2 = 1 . (9.10)
The time evolution of the state is governed by a unitary operator U on a vector space.
9.3 Why is a Quantum Computer?
Anything a quantum computer can perform can also be done in a classical computer. Then,
why should one think of a quantum computer? In the following we list some of the difficulties
with classical computers and the advantages of quantum computers.
1. A quantum computer is very efficient over a classical computer.
Example 1:
Consider a quantum state of a modest number of qubits, for example 100 lines in
a Hilbert space of dimensions 2100 ∼ 1030. To perform a computation a classical
computer has to work with matrices of exponentially large size and this would
take a very long time.
1A term defining the maximum number of digital inputs allowed by a logic gate.
2
It defines the maximum number of digital inputs that the output of logic gates can feed.Fundamental Properties 205
Example 2:
A single computation acting on say, 300 qubits can achieve the same effect as
2
300 computations acting simultaneously on classical bits.
Example 3:
To factor a 400 digit number, a powerful workstation would require about 10
years. But a quantum computer could complete the same task in just a few
minutes.
2. There are a number of problems for which the underlying process can be speeded￾up tremendously through quantum algorithms. Consider a number N of L digits
so that N ≈ 10L. To determine its factors, in the least case, it is required to
divide N by numbers up to √
N . That is √
N ∼ 10L/2 operations are essential.
Hence, the number of operations would increase with L exponentially. The best
known classical algorithm requires s = Ae
1.9L
1/3
(log L)
2/3
(A is a constant) number
of operations for factorizing an L digit number. Therefore, it is not considered
an efficient algorithm. To factorize a 130 digit number at the rate of ∼ 1012
operations per second, a classical computer would require ∼ 42 days. It would
require ∼ 10 years for a 400 digit number. However, a quantum algorithm of Peter
Williston Shor requires time ∝ L
3
.
3. Computations cannot be reversible in a classical computer (why can’t a computer
run backwards?). In quantum theory, reverse time evolution is specified by the
unitary operator U
−1 = U
†
. A consequence of this is that computations can be
reversible in a quantum computer.
4. Calculations in a classical computer lead to dissipation in order to damp out an
attempt by the system to make a transition. In contrast, in a quantum computer
dissipation cannot be used and further the accuracy of a computation is built-in.
5. In a classical computer errors in the initial data may grow exponentially with
the number of steps involved. This is because, the classical dynamics involves the
symplectic group that is noncompact. In quantum mechanics, inaccuracies in the
initial data do not grow. This is because it uses the compact unitary group.
9.4 Fundamental Properties
In the following we discuss the fundamental properties of quantum systems that are relevant
to information processing.

Parallel computation paths in the superposition, like a particle’s path through an interfer￾ometer, can cancel one another or reinforce depending on their relative phase.
Entanglement:
Certain states of a complete quantum system do not form definite states of its parts. For
more details see chapter 7.
Nonlocality and uncertainty:
An unknown quantum state cannot be copied (cloned) accurately. It cannot be observed
without being disturbed.
A quantum computer has a register with n qubits. A qubit has 0 and 1 classical states
so that the register has 2n classical states. The state of a quantum computer is described
by a 2n-dimensional vector, x, indexed by i = 000 . . . 00, 000 . . . 01, 000 . . . 10, . . ., 111 . . . 11
in binary notation. Moreover,
||x||2 =
sX
j
|xj |
2 = 1 (9.11)
and |xj |
2
is the probability that the register is in state j. We call x the wave function (ψ)
of the register.
In a quantum computer, the software is represented by ψ and the hardware by a Hamil￾tonian. The Hamiltonian describes the dynamics of the central processing unit (CPU). The
hardware generates a unitary evolution of ψ(t) representing the state of the software at
time t. The software is a finite string of bits with a logical meaning. It includes the inputs
(such as programs and data), the output and a scratch pad necessary to store intermediate
results. The states, for example, | ↓i and | ↑i represent a bit with logical values 0 and 1,
respectively.
9.4.2 Two-Bit Gates for Universal Computation
In a classical computer logic gates are used to process information. David Deutsch has
shown a way to obtain a universal quantum computation. Tommaso Toffoli [14] showed
how the AND and XOR gates can be implemented reversibly. Recall that conventional
AND and XOR gates are not reversible because a reversible gate must contain the same
number of input and output bits. However, XOR can be implemented reversibly with a
two-bit gate where one output bit may return the conventional XOR. ⊕ is used to denote
for the exclusive-or operation. a1⊕a2 (a1 and a2 are the binary values of the two input bits)
is given by a one output bit, while the second output bit returns the original value of a1
(or a2). To implement AND reversibly, a three-bit gate is used, where a1 and a2 are passed
through unchanged and the third bit is XORed with the AND of the first two, returning
(a1 · a2) ⊕ a3. Because this three-bit gate has both the XOR and the AND functions, it can
be considered as a universal reversible gate. This gate is called Toffoli gate.
9.4.3 NOT, Z and Hadamard Gates
A simple classical gate is the NOT gate (swap gate) that changes 0 to 1 and 1 to 0. An
analogous quantum NOT gate transforms states in a particular basis into states orthogonal
to them. The unitary operation UNOT is given by
UNOT|0i = |1i, UNOT|1i = |0i. (9.12)Fundamental Properties 207

Unlike the digital gates, the quantum gates are assumed to act on superposition states. The
UNOT provides the transformation
UNOT(α|0i + β|1i) = α|1i + β|0i. (9.13)
Here α and β are the amplitudes of the states. If we represent |0i and |1i in column matrix
then the output of the NOT gate is

The truth table of the quantum NOT gate is given in the table 9.2.
In classical gates, the NOT gate is the only nontrivial single-bit gate. In quantum me￾chanics there are many nontrivial qubit gates with |α|

tables 9.3 and 9.4, respectively. These gates are represented pictorially as shown in Fig. 9.1.

It acts on a single qubit. Its effect is to rotate the state about the y-axis.
Interestingly, there are infinitely many 2 × 2 unitary matrices and so infinitely many
qubit gates. Remember that the classical NOT gate is the single one-bit. Any single qubit
unitary gate can be decomposed as

target state is shown in table 9.5. In this table if we treat the first two columns as the input
and third as the output then this table is the truth table of classical XOR gate. In operator
form CNOT is
CNOT = |00ih00| + |01ih01| + |10ih11| + |11ih10| . (9.19)
The first qubit is the control and the target is the second qubit. The first two terms in
Eq. (9.19) indicates that if the control qubit is in the state |0i then the target state remains
the same. The target state is changed when the control state is |1i. The last two terms
in Eq. (9.19) represent these. Because the state of the second qubit is dependent on the
first qubit’s state, the two qubits become entangled on passing through the CNOT gate.
Combination of the CNOT and the Hadamard gates can be used to realize both quantum
superposition and entanglement. We notice that the control and the target qubits are XORed
and stored in the target qubit. The matrix representation of the CNOT operation is given
by

three outputs a

The Fredkin gate also called controlled swap gate [15] is designed to compare the two states
|ψi and |ψ
0
i. Figure 9.6 shows the circuit for the Fredkin gate. One can prepare an ancilla
qubit (|0i+|1i)/
√
2 and carry out a controlled swap test on |ψi and |ψ
0
i. For |ψi = |ψ
0
i, after
performing a Hadamard operation the ancilla qubit becomes |0i and is said to pass the swap
test. If hψ|ψ
0
i ≤ δ then the ancilla qubit upon measurement fails the test with probability
(1 − δ

9.4.7 Evaluation of Functions
Let us describe the calculation of functions by quantum computers. Consider a function
f : {0, 1, . . . , 2
m − 1} → {0, 1, . . . , 2
n − 1} , (9.30)
where m and n are positive integers. A classical computer calculates f by evolving the
inputs 0, 1, . . . , 2
m − 1 into the outputs f(0), f(1), . . . , f(2m − 1). Quantum computers use
two registers. Input is stored in the first register and the second is for output. The quantum
state of the first register is represented as |xi. Output may be represented by |yi. The
function evaluation is computed by a unitary evolution operator Uf that acts on the two
registers, that is,
Uf |xi|0i = |xi|f(x)i = |x, f(x)i , (9.31)
where the output is initially set to 0. The values of f(0), . . . , f(2m − 1) found by applying

9.5 Quantum Algorithms
One can simulate a classical circuit using a quantum circuit. That is, it is possible to perform
classical computations on quantum computers. But the advantage of quantum computing
is that powerful functions may be computed by making use of quantum parallelism, the
fundamental feature of many quantum algorithms. It allows a quantum computer to evaluate
f(x) for many different values of x simultaneously. This parallelism is not immediately useful
because a measurement would give f(x) for a single value of x only as in the case of a classical
computer.
Quantum computation needs something much more than that quantum parallelism to be
useful. This is achieved in Deutsch’s algorithm [8,17] which combines quantum parallelism214 Quantum Computers
with interference. Using Deutsch’s algorithm, information about a f(x) can be obtained
very quickly compared with a classical computer. Deutsch’s algorithm is a simple case of
a more general Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm [11]. It suggests that quantum computers may be
capable of solving certain problems more efficiently than classical computers.
There are three classes of quantum algorithms that provide an advantage over classical
algorithms.
1. There is the class of algorithms based on quantum Fourier transform. Examples
are the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm of finding whether a given function is a constant
or not and the Shor’s algorithms for factoring and discrete logarithm.
2. The second class is quantum search algorithms. Their principles were discovered
by Grover [18]. The goal of a quantum search algorithm is given a search space
of size N finding an element of that search space having a known property. A
quantum search algorithm achieves this in approximately √
N operations whereas
a classical computer requires about N operations.
3. Another class of quantum algorithms is quantum simulation, where a quantum
computer is explored to simulate a quantum system.
9.5.1 Deutsch’s Algorithm
The first and the simplest quantum algorithm is Deutsch’s problem. Let f(x) denote one
bit functions with x = 0 or 1. There are only four possibilities:
f1(0) = 0, f1(1) = 0. f2(0) = 0, f2(1) = 1.
f3(0) = 1, f3(1) = 0. f4(0) = 1, f4(1) = 1.
(9.33)
Given an unknown f the problem is to determine which one of the above four classes
it belongs to. In a classical algorithm we can calculate f(0) and f(1) and then find its
class by comparing the values of f(0) and f(1) with Eqs. (9.33). Therefore, we wish to
evaluate f at 0 and 1. But a quantum algorithm requires only one evaluation. Deutsch
proposed a quantum algorithm for the above problem which is based on the principle that
the superposition of quantum states provide the possibility to perform computation on
many states simultaneously. The algorithm consists of three steps.
Consider the operation UA
UA|0i =
1
√
2
[|0i + |1i] , UA|1i =
1
√
2
[|0i − |1i] . (9.34)
Applying n times UA to an n-bit quantum register in the state |0i we have
|ψi = UA ⊗ UA ⊗ . . . UA|000 . . . 0i

|ii . (9.35)
That is, n applications of UA yields a register state that has 2n distinct terms. Note that
in classical case n elementary operations can only give one state of the register giving one
number.Quantum Algorithms 215
Let us start with two qubits. One bit is set to the state |0i and the other is to the state
|1i. The total state is |01i. In the first step, we apply the gate UA to each qubit. This gives
1

1
√
2
[ |0i − |1i] = 1
2
[ |00i − |01i + |10i − |11i] . (9.36)
In the second step, compute f on the superposition state given by Eq. (9.36). This is realized
by a two-bit gate Uf (Eq. (9.31)) acting on the basis vector
|x, yi → |x, y ⊕ f(x)i , x, y = 0, 1 (9.37)
where ⊕ denotes addition mod 2. The last step is to apply UA again on each qubit.
Let us apply the above algorithm assuming f = f1. The first step yields the superposition
state given by Eq. (9.36). This is independent of the function. The second step gives

|ψi =

= |11i . (9.41)
In a similar manner for f = f3 and f = f4 we obtain |ψi = −|11i and |ψi = −|01i,
respectively. Therefore, the final state of the two qubits is
|01i if f = f1, |11i if f = f2,
−|11i if f = f3, −|01i if f = f4.
(9.42)
Thus, by comparing the final state of |ψi with Eq. (9.42) we can identify whether the
unknown f is f1 or f2 or f3 or f4.216 Quantum Computers

Quantum circuit to implement Deutsch’s algorithm.
The essential features of the above quantum algorithm are:
1. The crucial elements are the superposition and linearity of quantum mechanics.
|ψi in Eq. (9.42) is computed on the superposition states |00i, |01i, |10i and |11i
simultaneously.
2. The final state |ψi is due to an interference of various parts of the superposition.
3. If it is desired to know whether f is a constant (f = f1 or f4) or balance (f = f2
or f3) then it is enough to measure the final state of the first qubit. If the first
qubit is |0i then f is a constant. f is balance if the first qubit is |1i. Notice that
the algorithm does not say whether f is f1 or f4 and f2 or f3. However, nowhere
we learn about either f(0) or f(1). We are able to find out that the f is a constant
or not by computing f once. In classical computation we must evaluate f twice
before making a decision.
The quantum circuit to implement Deutsch’s algorithm is given in Fig. 9.8. The input
state is |ψii = |01i and the output is
|ψf i = ±|f(0) ⊕ f(1)i

|0i − |1i


. (9.43)
So, by measuring the first qubit, we may determine f(0) ⊕ f(1) and hence whether f(x)
is balance or not. We cannot determine f(x). But determine a global property of f(x),
namely, f(0) ⊕ f(1) with one evaluation of f(x) only. So, a clever choice of function and
final transformation allows efficient determination of useful information about the function.
The above is achieved much faster compared to a classical computer.
9.5.2 Grover’s Quantum Search Algorithm
In this subsection we explain the quantum search algorithm [12,18,19] and describe some
of the exciting ways it can be used.
The kind of search problem that can be solved by a quantum search algorithm is fol￾lowing. Consider a function f(x) with integer arguments 0 to N. Let the value of it be
0 everywhere except for x = ω. The problem is to find ω using few calls to f(x). This is
analogous to finding the name of person in a telephone directory with the telephone number
given. The data-base we wish to search is of size N. Classically, the probability of the value
of a randomly chosen element to be ω is 1/N. Therefore, to have a 50−50 chance of getting
ω we must call the data-base at least N/2 times. But a quantum algorithm can reduce the
calls to approximately √
N .
Lov Kumar Grover, a computer scientist at Lucent Technologies Bell Laboratories pro￾posed a quantum search algorithm. In the following we discuss Grover’s algorithm followingQuantum Algorithms 217
mainly the review of Sudarshan [19]. We can model an oracle or a unitary operator Uω(λ)
as a black-box function f(x). It computes f(x) for an input x. It will return 1 if and only if
x = ω and return 0 if x 6= ω. A quantum circuit that has the ability to recognize solutions to
the search problem is called a quantum oracle which is represented by the unitary operator
Uω.
We begin with the state |0 0i. The two zero’s represent two registers of qubits, where all
the qubits are set to the 0 state. We can use Hadamard transformation to bring this initial
state into superposition of states
|φi =
1
√
N
[ |00i + |10i + |20i + . . . + |N − 10i] . (9.44)
In matrix form, the transformation is given by Eq. (9.16). In Grover’s algorithm the first
register is assumed to be big enough to represent the largest element. In the second register,
there is only one qubit. By applying the Hadamard transformations on the individual qubits
of the initial state we get
|φi =

N

i=0

. (9.45)
The number of steps needed for this is O(log N). The second register is initialized to a state
different from |0i. The action of the oracle Uω is
Uω|i, ji = |i, j ⊕ f(i)i . (9.46)
|ii is the index register, |ji is the oracle single qubit which is flipped if f(i) = 1 and
unchanged otherwise. We can find whether i is a solution of the problem by preparing
|ii|0i, applying the oracle and checking whether the oracle qubit is flipped to |1i. We have
Uω|φi =


 . (9.47)
The action of Uω on |φi is to change the sign of the component in the direction of |ωi. This
reflects |φi in the Hilbert space of dimension N about the hyperplane orthogonal to |ωi. At
this instant the value of ω is unknown to us. We can find the value of ω by consulting the
oracle a certain minimum number of times.
Now, we construct another operator Us which performs a reflection in such a way that
the component of |φi along |si is preserved and the signs of the component in the hyperplane
perpendicular to |si is changed. Here one iteration is the unitary transformation RGrov =
UsUω. Let θ be the angle between |si and |ωi. Then the action of one iteration on |φi is
to rotate its component along |si through an angle 2θ that is away from the hyperplane
perpendicular to the vector |ωi. Successive iterations with various choices of |si makes |φi
close to |ωi and moreover away from the hyperplane perpendicular to |ωi. The number
of queries required to obtain the correct value of |ωi with large probability when |φi is
measured after the iterations is π
√
N /4. So, Grover’s algorithm has a quadratic speed up
compared to the best classical algorithm.

This transforms a set of N numbers {g0, g1, . . . , gN−1} (can be complex) into another set
of numbers {f0, f1, . . . , fN−1}. The quantum Fourier transform UFT is defined, on n qubits
by its action on basis states |ji, where 0 ≤ j ≤ 2
n − 1, as
UFT|ji → 1
√
N

Xn−1
k=0

It can be easily verified that UFT is a unitary operator: The matrix of the transformation
is M(UFT) = [Mjk] = ei2πjk/N /
√
N. This transformation can be realized as a quantum
circuit.
Many of the quantum algorithms are based on quantum Fourier transform (QFT). Shor’s
fast algorithm for factoring and discrete logarithm are two most interesting examples of algo￾rithms based on the QFT. Classically, the fast Fourier transform takes about N log N = n2
n
steps to Fourier transform N = 2n numbers. A quantum computer requires only n
2
steps.
So, there is an exponential saving of time with a quantum computer compared to a classical
computer. But it is to be noted that the set {fj} cannot be measured directly because a
measurement would collapse each qubit into |0i or |1i. Though quantum computation can
be done more efficiently, creating the initial state {gk} and measuring the result are difficult.
A circuit decomposition of the QFT has been developed for hybrid qudits based on
generalized Hadamard and controlled-phase gates which would be realized by means of
selective rotations in NMR [20]. The hybrid qudit QFT was experimentally implemented
on an NMR quantum emulator making use of four qubits to emulate a single qutrit coupled
to two qubits. A simplified mathematical construction of the QFT suitable for systems
described by Ising type Hamiltonians is reported and is based on one-qubit gates and a free
evolution process [21].
9.5.4 Applications of Quantum Search
Let us point out some of the applications of quantum search.
1. An effective search algorithm for hard problems, like constrained optimization,
is the so-called randomized algorithm. In it a set of random numbers is used to
find a trajectory through some search space. Quantum search is able to speed up
randomized algorithms.
2. Quantum search can be applied to determine the statistical properties mean,
variance, maxima and minima of functions, etc.
3. With quantum Fourier transform one can count effectively the number of possible
solutions of a problem without finding them.
4. Quantum search is useful for experimental physicists to prepare desired superpo￾sition states. For example, to create a superposition of indices corresponding to
prime numbers we can design an oracle f(x) which returns 1 if x is a prime and
0 otherwise.
9.5.5 Shor’s Algorithm
In 1994 Shor [9] developed an efficient quantum algorithm to compute the period of a
periodic function. The period finding routine can be used to factorize large numbers in
polynomial time. Consider the problem of factorizing a large number N into exactly two
large prime numbers [19]. Classically, to find the two prime numbers we have to check all
the numbers from 1 to √
N.Quantum Algorithms 219
In Shor’s algorithm, randomly a number a < N, a
r = 1 (mod N) for an even integer
value of r is chosen. It can be shown that for most choices of a, N shares a common factor
having a
r/2 + 1 or a
r/2 − 1. Once r is found then applying a classical Euclid’s algorithm
one can easily compute the common factor of N and also a
r/2 ± 1. Thus, the problem of
factorizing N is solved.
Let us choose
fN,a(x) = a
x
(mod N), x = 0, 1, 2, . . . . (9.50)
Because a
r = 1 (mod N) the period of fN,a is r. Evaluate fN,a on a |φi given by
|φi =
1
√
N
N
X−1
i=0
|i0i . (9.51)
Next, we set-up a unitary oracle UfN,a such that
UfN,a |φi =
1
√
N
N
X−1
i=0
|iax
(mod N)i = |ψi . (9.52)
The second register has a function with period r. Therefore, if we perform a measurement
on it and obtain |ui then the first register will collapse to a linear combination of the values
of x. This results in f(x) = u. Due to the periodicity of f these values of x form x0 + jr,
j = 0, 2, . . . , xmax/r, where xmax is the biggest number contained in the first register. We
have f(x0) = u. Suppose t = xmax/r is an integer. The measurement is found to reduce |φi
to
|φi =
1
p
xmax/r
xmax X−1
j=0
|x0 + jri |ui . (9.53)
Now, to get the value of r apply a quantum Fourier transform on the first register (of the
state |φi). The effect is
UFT|φi → X
k
f(k)|ki |ui , (9.54)
where f(k) = 1 if k is a multiple of xmax/r otherwise 0. The value of k determined by the
measurement of the first register will be of the form k = λxmax/r. λ and r are unknown.
But if λ and r do not have a common factor then k/xmax = λ/r can be reduced to an
irreducible fraction to read r and λ. On the other hand, if λ and r have a common factor
then we conclude that the algorithm fails. In this case we repeat the analysis with another
value of a. It is possible to show that the number of steps taken by the algorithm to get
the correct answer is O(log N). This is indeed an exponential speed up compared to the
classical case.
9.5.6 Quantum Factorization of Integers
Let us describe the quantum factorization of integers by considering the number N = 20.
First, choose a number a randomly such that the greatest common divisor of it and N is 1.
Consider the periodic function
f(x) = a
x
(mod N), x = 0, 1, . . . . (9.55)220 Quantum Computers
For N = 20, select a = 9. Then from Eq. (9.55) we have
f(0) = 1 (mod 20) = 1. f(1) = 9 (mod 20) = 9.
f(2) = 92
(mod 20) = 81 (mod 20) = 1.
f(3) = 93
(mod 20) = 729 (mod 20) = 9.
f(4) = 94
(mod 20) = 6561 (mod 20) = 1.
From the above, the period T of f(x) is found as T = 2. This period can be determined
by employing the method described earlier. To find N, calculate Z = a
T /2 = 91 = 9. The
greatest common divisor of (Z + 1, N) = (9 + 1, 20) = (10, 20) is 10. The greatest common
divisor of (Z − 1, N) = (9 − 1, 20) = (8, 20) is 4. 4 and 10 are factors of 20. In this way
two factors of a number N can be obtained if the quantum algorithm gives the period T of
f(x).
9.6 Testing Quantum Computers Using Grover’s
Algorithm
Many experimental quantum computers have been developed. But no quantum computer
has achieved so far the quantum supremacy, which is a crossing point where a quantum com￾puter can simulate a quantum system which cannot be done on a classical super computer.
Though publically available quantum processors continue to proliferate, they are all plagued
by many errors such as cross-talk, coherent noise drift and decoherence [22]. Consequently,
the experimentally available quantum computers suffer from numerous issues that prevent
them from running complex algorithms with reasonable accuracy. The physical accuracy
of quantum computers has not come closer to reaching the theoretically expected levels.
Grover’s algorithm has been used to evaluate the accuracy of quantum computers [23].
Tests were conducted using Grover’s algorithm and implemented in a variety of different
ways on the publically available IBM quantum computers.
We have seen that Gover’s algorithm is a quantum search algorithm. This algorithm
has been used to find the index of the target element among the list of N = 2n elements,
where n is the number of qubits and N is the size of the list [23]. The procedure of Grover’s
algorithm to test the IBM quantum computer is given below [23]:
1. Prepare |0i
⊗n, where ⊗ means tensor multiplication, that is, |0i
⊗n is equivalent
to |0i ⊗ |0i ⊗ . . . ⊗ |0i with n-terms.
2. Apply H⊗n to create a superposition.
3. Apply the oracle U to mark the target element by negating its sign, that is,
U|xi = −|xi, where |xi is the target.
4. Apply the Grover’s diffusion operator D to amplify the probability amplitude of
the target element. D can be written as [3]
2|ψihψ| − IN = H⊗n
(2|0ih0| − IN )H⊗n
. (9.56)
In this expression |ψi is the uniform superposition of states and IN is the identity
matrix with dimensionality N.
5. Repeat the steps 3 and 4 for about √
N times.
6. Perform measurements.Features of Quantum Computation 221
It is found that Grover diffusion can be implemented on a quantum circuit with a
phase-shift operator which negates every states except for |0i sandwiched between H⊗n
gates. 2-qubit, 3-qubit and 4-qubit Grover’s algorithms have been implemented on the IBM
quantum computers3
. The following five experiments were performed.
1. Identification of the effect of varying the length/complexity of an algorithm.
2. Comparison of the differences between different choices of qubits and finding the
significance of using the best qubits in building a quantum circuits.
3. Comparison of the accuracy and speed of each of the IBM quantum devices.
4. Determination of the effect of loading the quantum computer with varying number
of executions.
5. Determination of error bar for the results produced by the quantum computers.
The outcomes of the above experiments suggested that there appears to be a long way
to go before quantum computers can surpass classical computers in accuracy and speed.
Further, the experiments have shown that implementing quantum algorithms can be heavily
affected by the qubit choice.
9.7 Features of Quantum Computation
Some of the essential (but not sufficient) features of quantum computers [24] are summarized
below:
1. Input, output, program and memory are represented by qubits.
2. A unitary transformation of the computer can represent a computation step.
3. All computations are reversible.
4. Only one-to-one operations are possible and therefore qubits cannot be copied.
5. The values of qubits may depend on the method used to infer them and on the
co-measured qubits.
6. A measurement may be performed on any qubit at any stage of computation.
However, a qubit cannot be measured by an experiment with a desired accuracy.
7. During a computation, a quantum computer proceeds all paths at once which
when managed cleverly may speed up the computation.
8. A subroutine should not leave any qubits over its computed answer. This is be￾cause the computational paths with different information cannot interfere.
9.8 Quantum Computation Through NMR
The essential requirement of a quantum computer are two-level isolated quantum systems.
The physical systems explored so far to build quantum hardwares range from optical pho￾3
IBM has set-up Quantum System One. Its physical design was tested first time in Milan, Italy. IBM
now offers cloud access to its quantum computers to develop and run programs.222 Quantum Computers
tons, cavity quantum electrodynamics, quantum dots, trapped ions to nuclear spins. The
basic requirements of a quantum computer are:
1. The quantum states must be sufficiently isolated from the surroundings so that
they have very low decoherence.
2. They must be made to evolve as per the unitary transformations performed.
3. It should be possible to prepare the initial state.
4. Suitable measurement technique must be devised for measuring quantum infor￾mation because a measurement destroys quantum information and replaces it
with classical information.
As a candidate for quantum computing, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is attractive
because of the spin’s long coherence times and also due to the complexity of operations
performed on modern spectrometers. Most atomic nuclei have spin and it causes them to
act like tiny magnets. These nuclear magnets interact with magnetic fields thereby allowing
them to be controlled with high precision. In certain cases, such as in hydrogen, this nuclear
spin can assume two values, spin-up and spin-down. This is a two-state quantum system.
Therefore, a hydrogen nucleus can be regarded as a qubit. In a molecule, different nuclei can
be differentiated by their different resonance frequencies. Consequently, the molecule can
act as a quantum computer with each hydrogen providing one qubit. For example, naturally
occurring cytosine has five hydrogen atoms in each molecule. It is in fact easy to replace three
of them with deuterium, thereby leaving the two hydrogens to serve a two-qubit computer.
This system with a conventional NMR spectrometer has been used to demonstrate certain
quantum algorithms. Various nonselective pulses, transition and spin-selective pulses, rf
gradients, coherence transfer via J-coupling and simultaneous multi-site excitation have
been proposed to construct universal quantum gates and implement quantum algorithms
for qubit systems. For some details see refs. [13,25–28].
9.9 Why is Making a Quantum Computer Extremely
Difficult?
If quantum computers would be so marvelous, why don’t we just build one? There are several
technical problems in setting up a quantum computer. We list some of them:
1. A notable serious problem is decoherence. It is the modification of the quantum
state due to interaction with an environment. It can alter the value of a qubit
that is uncontrollable.
2. Errors in classical information are discrete. In quantum information they are
continuous.
3. To check whether errors have occurred, we must perform a quantum measurement
which will affect the state of the system. That is, errors cannot be diagnosed
without introducing further errors.
4. To obtain the outcome of a computation, a readout system must carry out a mea￾surement. Any imperfection in the measurement process gives rise to a readout
error.
5. A transistor or any conventional computer element cannot be useful to perform
quantum computation. The various degrees of freedom of the device (such as theConcluding Remarks 223
elastic vibrations of the device, the excitation of its conduction electrons, etc.)
interact strongly with one another and also with the state of the device. As a
result even approximate unitary evolution is impossible.
9.10 Concluding Remarks
Quantum algorithms for solving both linear and nonlinear differential, equations [29–33],
quantum field theories [34] and simulation of sparse Hamiltonian systems [35], chemical dy￾namics [36] and electronic structure Hamiltonians [37] have been proposed. Quantum com￾puting using coherent photon conversion [38], fullerene based electron spin [39,40], trapped
polar molecules [41], Josephson junction arrays [42], scanning tunnelling microscopy [43],
antiferromagnetic rings [44], one-dimensional optical lattice [45] and quantum walk [46] have
been proposed. Simulation of electronic structure Hamiltonians [47], many-body Fermi sys￾tems [48], calculations of molecular properties [49], molecular energies [50] using quantum
computers were reported. Implementation of Deutsch’s algorithm on an ion-trap quantum
computer [51] and experimental realization of it in a one-way quantum computer [52] have
been achieved. Magnetic resonance realization of decoherence-free quantum computation
[53], performance of adiabatic quantum computation subject to decoherence [54], role of
entanglement and correlations in mixed-state quantum computation [55], quantum discord
and the power of one qubit [56] enhancement of quantum computation using quantum chaos
[57] and geometric phase-shift in quantum computation using superconducting nano circuits
[58] were analyzed.

Quantum Cryptography
10.1 Introduction
Users of communication channels wish to have their transactions secured. Therefore, it is
necessary to develop techniques which can ensure that eavesdroppers cannot intercept the
messages transmitted. The technology concerned with the secure communication of data is
termed as cryptography [1–3]. It is the art of hiding information in the form of a string of
bits to an unauthorized party. To achieve this goal, in a classical cryptography system the
message bits are combined with random bits of equal length called a key. The combined
data is known as cryptogram. This technique is called encryption. A key can be public
or private. The public key is to encode plaintext, while the private key is for decoding
the previously encoded plaintext or cryptogram. The cryptogram is generally sent through
the communication channel. Because of the randomness of the key the encoded message
is completely random. Consequently, the message is untraceable to an eavesdropper. The
safety of the transmission completely depends on the safety of the key. Therefore, the key
should be kept secret by the users.
Classically, the key can be distributed to the users via a trusted courier or in personal
meetings. Because of this, for many applications the technique becomes expensive and not
practical. Further, the safety could be destroyed by modern technology like faster computers
or mathematical advances in algorithms or progress in theoretical computation. Recently,
an innovative new technique called quantum cryptography [4–8] has been developed where
safety does not depend on computing abilities. Quantum cryptography lies at the intersec￾tion of information theory and quantum mechanics. The idea of quantum cryptography [9]
was first proposed in the 1970s by Stephen Wiesner. After the introduction of three proto￾cols [10] by the computer scientists and physicists Charles H. Bennett and Gilles Brassard
in 1984 and their first implementation [11] in 1992, a remarkable interest has propelled
quantum theory into computer science and physics.
10.2 Standard Cryptosystems
Cryptosystems come in two major classes depending on whether the key (random string
of bits) is shared in public or in secret. The one-time pad system shares a secret key and
the other is the public key system [12]. In public key cryptography, messages are exchanged
using keys. The keys depend on the underlying difficulty of a mathematical problem. Sender
and receiver have a public key and the private key. The former is to encrypt messages. The
latter is to decrypt the messages. In the secret key encryption, a key is shared by the users
who use it to transform plaintext inputs to an encoded cipher.

The Vernam one-time pad system.
10.2.1 One-Time Pad System
The one-time pad system was first proposed by Gilbert Vernam in 1926. It is the only
cryptosystem with proven-perfect secrecy. In this scheme a sender is called Alice (the con￾ventional name) and a receiver is called Bob. Alice encrypts a message using a random key
and then adds each bit of the message to the corresponding bit of the key. This text is then
sent to the receiver. Bob decrypts the message by subtracting the same key. The above
scheme is depicted in (Fig. 10.1). A problem with this scheme is that Alice and Bob should
have a common secret key. This key must be as long as the message. They can use the key
only once - hence the name one-time pad. If the key is utilized more than one encryption
then an unauthorized eavesdropper called Eve could record all the messages and build-up
a picture of the key. Another notable problem is with the exchange of key. The key can
be transmitted by a classical channel between Alice and Bob. This procedure is complex,
expensive and unsafe. The one-time pad system is used in many applications, for example,
e-commerce employs short keys.
10.2.2 Public Key Cryptosystems
The basic idea behind the public key cryptosystems was first proposed by Bailey Whitfield
Diffi and Martin E. Hellman [13] in 1977 and implementation was then developed [14,15]
by Ronald L. Rivest, Adi Shamir and L. Adlerman in 1978. These systems are based on
the so-called one-way functions, where it is easy to compute the function f(x) given x
but difficult to calculate x from known value of f(x). By difficulty, we mean that the time
needed to perform a task grows exponentially with the number of input bits while easy
means that the growth is polynomially. For example, the relation between a large number
and its primes can be used to generate a public key. In the public key systems, users need
not agree on a secret key before sending the message. They work with two keys: public and
private. The public key is to lock the message and the private key is to open it. The point
is that anyone can have a key to lock the message but only one person has a private key to
open it. In this sense the public key cryptosystem can be thought of as a mailbox. Anyone
can drop a letter in it but the owner alone can open it with his private key.
For Alice to send a message with a public key cryptosystem, Bob first chooses a private
key. He uses this key to find a public key. Alice then uses this public key to encrypt the mes￾sage. She sends the encrypted message to Bob. He decrypts it using his private key. Public
key cryptosystems are convenient and became very popular over the last three decades or
so. The security of the internet is partly based on such systems. However, this system suffersQuantum Cryptography–Basic Principle 231
from two problems. First, extracting a private key is very difficult but it is not impossible.
The second is that problems that are difficult for a classical computer may become easy
for a quantum computer. With the recent progress in the field of quantum computation
there are valid reasons to believe that in the near future it will be possible to build these
machines.
10.3 Quantum Cryptography–Basic Principle
Classical cryptography systems use mathematical techniques to prevent the eavesdroppers
from learning the encrypted messages. In contrast, in quantum cryptography the message
is protected by the fundamental laws of physics. Quantum cryptography is based on the
uncertainty principle which states that properties with certain pairs of observables are re￾lated in such a way that measuring one of the properties sets constraints on the observer in
simultaneously measuring the value of the other. Let us assume that we measure the polar￾ization of a photon with a vertical filter. Classically, if the photon passes through, assume
that, it is vertically polarized. Therefore, if we keep in front of the photon another filter
with an angle θ to the vertical, it cannot pass through. But there is a nonzero probability
pθ for the photon to go through the second filter. pθ decreases to 0 → θ reaches 90◦
from
0
◦
. pθ =
1
2 when θ = 45◦
. The point is that if the initial polarization is set either vertical
or horizontal and if the filter is in the 45◦
(or 135◦
) then we cannot determine any details
about the initial polarization of the photon.
Suppose a message is encoded using quantum signals (like photons polarized at various
angles). One cannot obtain information about the message without perturbations. The
perturbations would reveal eavesdropping. If the bits are not changed during transmission
we are sure that no eavesdropping took place. Thus, any eavesdropping will be spotted. Eve
cannot get information from the qubits transmitted to Bob from Alice without disturbing
their state. This is due to the following: (i) By the no-cloning theorem and (ii) disturbance
introduced to the signal by Eve’s measurement. We prove these statements below.
10.3.1 The No-Cloning Theorem
The no-cloning theorem (for more details see chapter 11) states that it is impossible to
produce a copy of an unknown quantum state |ψi. A copying machine will copy |ψi into a
target state. If the target state is a pure state1
|pi then the initial state of the machine is
|ii = |ψi|pi . (10.1)
After copying, |pi becomes |ψi. The final state of the machine is
|fi = |ψi|ψi . (10.2)
As the copying operation is described by unitary operation U, we have
U|ii = |fi , U|ψi|pi = |ψi|ψi . (10.3)
When we consider another unknown pure state |φi then
U|φi|pi = |φi|φi . (10.4)
1
It is a state that cannot be represented as a mixture of other states.232 Quantum Cryptography
Taking the inner product of (10.3) and (10.4) we get
hp|hφ|U
†U|ψi|pi = hφ|hφ|ψi|ψi
or
hφ|ψi = (hφ|ψi)
2
. (10.5)
Hence, hφ|ψi = 1 or 0. This means |ψi = |φi or |ψi and |φi should be orthogonal. Thus,
a cloning machine can only clone states orthogonal to one another. Therefore, a general
cloning device is impossible. A cloning machine to clone |1i and |0i is possible. But a device
to clone |1i and (|1i + |0i)/
√
2 are not possible.
Solved Problem 1:
Show that any attempt to distinguish two nonorthogonal states will disturb the signal.
Let |ψi and |φi be two nonorthogonal states. Eve tries to obtain information. Let the initial
target state of her machine be |pi. Assume that her process does not disturb the states. She
obtains
|ψi|pi −→ |ψ|ui , |φi|pi −→ |φ|u
0
i . (10.6)
To distinguish |ψi and |φi, Eve wants |ui and |u
0
i to be different. Since the process is
described by unitary transformation, the inner product has to be preserved. So,
hp|hφ|ψi|pi = hu
0
|hφ|ψi|ui
=⇒ hp|pihφ|ψi = hu
0
|uihφ|ψi
=⇒ hu
0
|ui = hp|pi = 1 (10.7)
which implies |ui and |u
0
i are identical. Distinguishing between |ψi and |φi would disturb
at least one of them. Hence, the sender and receiver can spot the eavesdropping.
10.3.2 Communication Channels
In quantum cryptography, the sender and receiver have two types of communication chan￾nels:
1. A classical public channel: This can be overheard by anyone. However, mes￾sage from this channel cannot be altered.
2. A quantum channel: In this channel an attempt of eavesdropping will intro￾duce perturbations in the transmission. This ensures the safety of the communi￾cation.
The classical channel can be used to exchange information and to transmit the encoded
message. The secret key can be transmitted via the quantum channel. Sender and receiver
exchange a series of bits via the quantum channel. They use part of the transmitted signal
to test for eavesdropping. They compare a randomly chosen part of their data using a public
channel. Deviations between their strings imply that an eavesdropper has listened to the
transmission and it is thus not a secret. No errors in the series of bits make sure that the
key is safe. The logic is
No disturbance =⇒ No measurement
=⇒ No eavesdropping .Types of Quantum Cryptography 233
But the intricate problem is that the quantum channels are extremely sensitive devices.
Particularly, some errors will be unavoidable because of the imperfections of the channels
and detectors. If the information leaked to Eve is not considerably high, then the sender
and receiver can make use of modern classical techniques to minimize it to approximately
zero by shortening the strings.
Some key features of quantum cryptography are:
1. It allows two parties to prepare and share a random secret key without insisting
to meet.
2. It uses the sensitivity of entangled systems to indicate to the two parties whether
an enemy has broken their encrypted communication.
3. It also makes use of the principle that a broken measurement on a quantum
system perturbs it and turns this fundamental limitation to a great advantage.
10.4 Types of Quantum Cryptography
The first protocol for quantum cryptography was proposed in 1984 by Bennett and Brassard
[10]. Some of the basic quantum cryptographic systems [16] are:
1. Four-states protocol,
2. Two-states protocol,
3. 4 + 2 protocol and
4. Multi-photon and multi-stage protocol.
The first relies on the transmission of single photons polarized randomly along four di￾rections. The second protocol uses two nonorthogonal states. The third is based on the
creation of pairs of EPR correlated photons. The fourth protocol is a quantum version of
the classical double-lock cryptography. Several variations of four-states protocol have been
developed [7,14].
10.4.1 Four-States Protocol [10,11,16]
Let us briefly describe the four-states scheme (BB84) of quantum cryptography. The BB84
protocol forms the basis for most of the practical quantum cryptography.
10.4.1.1 Basic Idea
This system uses polarization of photons to set-up a secret key for Alice and Bob. We know
that a photon can travel in any linear direction. When travelling along a linear direction,
it will vibrate. The vibration can be in any angle along its line of travel. However, its angle
of vibration will always be the same. This vibration is the polarization of the photon. A
polarized photon can be detected by a detector with correct polarization. An attempt to
eavesdrop the light at another polarization will destroy the stream. With the details of
polarizing a light beam, a key can be designed based on the condition of the beam and the
particles the other party received.
Each photon can be sent in one of the polarizations: 0◦
(−), 45◦
(/), 90◦
(|) or 135◦

FIGURE 10.2
BB84 protocol.
Alice and Bob have two polarizers. Each one in the 0◦/90◦
(−/|) (symbolically represented
as ‘+’) basis and one in the 45◦/135◦
(//\) (denoted as ‘×’) basis. The photons are assigned
a value 0 or 1. 0 for photons type − or / and 1 for photons of type | or \. Alice sends a stream
of photons. At the other end Bob measures the photons and determines their state. At this
stage Bob has to use a basis polarizer either + or ×. He chooses randomly one of these two
polarizers and measures the photon. His choice may or may not be correct. That is, Bob will
be wrong in measurements. In order to eliminate false measurements Alice and Bob discuss
through a public channel (a telephone or another insecure medium). Alice informs Bob of
the polaroid filter she used for the polarization of the photon. But she does not tell how
each photon was polarized. Alice will tell Bob whether a photon was sent with diagonal or
rectilinear polarizer but not whether the polarization was upper-right/lower-left or upper￾left/lower-right. If Alice finds that Bob used the correct polarizer for a particular photon
then that photon is retained. The incorrectly measured photons are discarded. They convert
the correctly measured series into bit strings of 0 and 1. Table 10.1 gives an example of the
above described process with a few photons [17]. Figure 10.2 depicts the BB84 protocol.Types of Quantum Cryptography 235
Due to the discard of incorrect measurements the newly obtained pad is shorter than
the original pad sent by Alice to Bob. Alice and Bob have now developed an unbreakable
key making use of the laws of quantum theory. Once the key is set-up they can begin the
encryption. If they identify an eavesdropping, they start the process again.
In this protocol the choice of basis is hidden from Eve. Eve cannot know the basis used.

10.4.1.2 Safety of the Four-States System
Suppose Eve intercepts the transmission and transmits a new pulse prepared as per the
obtained information. If Eve uses the correct basis then the error introduced is nil whereas
the use of wrong basis creates a 50% error rate. On the other hand, Eve gets total message
if correct basis is used and none for wrong. Therefore, when Eve eavesdrops on a fraction
η of the transmission, the error created is η/4. The information obtained is η/2. Hence, we
can write the mutual information, shared by sender and Eve and Eve and receiver as
I
(4)
SE = I
(4)
ER = 2Q , (10.9)
where Q is error rate. Alice and Bob cannot prevent eavesdropping, but they can detect the
eavesdropping. So, whenever they are unsatisfied with the security of the channel they can
create the key distribution again.
When noise exists due to eavesdropping, polarization identified by the receiver may not
be those of the sender. In order to deal with this possibility the following process is useful.
1. Alice and Bob agree on the perturbation of bit positions in their strings.
2. The strings are divided into blocks of, say, size k.
3. For each block Alice and Bob calculate and announce parities publicly. They
discard the last bit of each block.236 Quantum Cryptography
4. For each block with parities different, Alice and Bob use a binary search and
correct the error.
5. To remove undetected errors, steps (1)–(4) are repeated with increasing block
sizes.
6. To know whether errors still remain, Alice and Bob repeat a randomized check:
(a) Alice and Bob agree publicly on a random assortment of, say, half the bit
positions in their strings.
(b) Both compare parities publicly. If the strings differ then the parities will
disagree with 1/2 probability.
(c) If there is a disagreement, Alice and Bob apply a search and eliminate it.
7. If there is no disagreement after k iterations, both conclude that their strings
match with low probability error, 1/2
k
.
10.4.2 Two-States Protocol
In the following we consider the protocol of Bennett.
10.4.2.1 Basics of the Scheme
In this protocol [18] the sender uses weak coherent states, with phase encoding 0 or π with
respect to strong coherent states. Weak and strong states are denoted as | ± αi and |βi,
respectively. The expression for the overlap between the two states is
|hα| − αi| = cos δ = e−2|α|
2
. (10.10)
Sender uses two orthogonal polarizations. | ± αi and |βi have vertical and horizontal polar￾izations, respectively.
At the receiving end the two states are separated by a polarization beam splitter. |βi is
rotated to vertical polarization. It is sent through a beam splitter to a detector Dβ. A fraction
of |βi, equal to |αi is made to interface with | ± αi at another beam splitter. The reflected
and transmitted beams are sent towards the detectors, say, DR and DT, respectively. Thus, a
count in DT corresponds to 0 phase while a count in DR corresponds to phase π. If no count
is recorded in both DR and DT then the result is regarded as inconclusive. The probability
of such a result is worked out as [18]
P(?) = e−2|α|

Then the transmission rate of channel is

10.4.2.2 Safety of the System
Eve can get a certain amount of information by projecting the signal onto the orthogonal
basis B = (i, j) as shown in Fig. 10.3.
This gives probabilistic information only. The error rate introduced by Eve is the prob￾ability of wrong prediction. For example, for the input state |αi the probability for getting
j is [18]

10.4.3 4 + 2 Protocol
The idea of this method [19] is that in the four-states method the two states in each basis
need not be orthogonal. By choosing nonorthogonal states, we can get the advantage of the
two-states protocol: Eve cannot distinguish between the two states in each basis.
The first pair corresponds to 0 and π phase-shifts. The second pair is the phase-shifts
π/2 and 3π/2. The four states are |αi, |−αi, |iαi and |−iαi. The detection system is similar
to that used in the two-states system with the inclusion of an optional π/2 phase shifter.
Phase-shift will not be used if the observation is in the first basis. Hence, the receiver’s
detection is able to differentiate between |αi and | − αi. π/2 phase-shift can be used for the
second basis. This differentiates between |iαi and | − iαi.
Eve does not know the basis of the sender. Therefore, Eve is unsure whether the result
is relevant. Sender and receiver use a different basis in half of the communication and hence
such cases have to be discarded. Now, the transmission rate of the channel is T
(4+2) =
(1 − P(?))/2. Using P(?) given by Eq. (10.11), we obtain
T
(4+2) = (1 − cos δ)/2. (10.17)

For the 4 + 2 states protocol determine hα| − αi.
As |αi is normalized, it is a unit vector. So, we write
|αi = i cos θ + jsin θ
| − αi = i cos(θ + δ) + jsin(θ + δ) . (10.20)
Therefore,
hα| − αi = cos(θ + δ) cos θ + sin(θ + δ) sin θ
= cos(θ + δ − θ)
= cos δ . (10.21)
10.4.4 Multi-Photon and Mult-Stage Protocol
Clifford Chan and his collaborators have proposed a multi-photon (MP) QKD [20]. The
various steps involved in the MPQKD are the following:
1. The target state X is one of the two orthogonal states |0i and |1i and is to be
transferred from Alice to Bob. The qubit can be encoded using the polarization
of photons in a coherent state. For example, X can be represented by the polar￾ization angle dented as θX. The polarization rotations through angles θA and θB
can represent UA and UB, respectively.
2. UA and UB are some secret unitary transformations with the property UAUB =
UBUA. Alice applies UA on X and then sends it to Bob.
3. Bob randomly chooses to return the recieved signal to Alice after applying UB on
it or to retain the received UA(X) for authentication.
4. Alice randomly chooses to send the recieved one after applying U
†
A on it or to
retain UBUA(X).
5. Bob applies U
†
B
on the signal U
†
AUBUA(X) = UB(X) sent by Alice and get X.
6. Bob, after receiving all the pulses, publicly announces the measured pulses. Then
Alice discards the pulses not measured by Bob. If the bit rate of the key is found
to be too low then the key is abonded.
7. Bob informs Alice the qubits chosen by him for authentication. Alice discloses
Bob the associated transformations and X applied by her for those qubits. The
possibility of eavesdropping is tested using these transformations. The pulse re￾tained by Alice can be used for authentication. To find the error rate of the key
Alice tells to Bob some part of the exchanged information X. If the error rate
and the transformations are found to be below certain thresholds then the rest
of the key is accepted.
8. At the end Alice and Bob perform post-processing, that is, privacy amplification
and error correction in order to minimize Eve’s information.Multiparty Quantum Secret Sharing 239
10.5 Multiparty Quantum Secret Sharing
In the protocols discussed earlier, information is exchanged between two parties. In contrast
to this in quantum secret sharing (QSS) the message is split into many shadows so that each
shadow alone cannot recover the information, but a specific quantity of shadows can [21–23].
For example, consider a three-party QSS protocol. Alice (boss) splits her secret message into
two and transmits one part to Bob and another part to Charlie. Note that each agent alone
cannot recover the secret message of Alice. To recover the secret Bob and Charlie have to
cooperate. That is, the secret can be locked from being revealed by Eve (a dishonest agent)
alone. In this section we briefly outline the multiparty QSS (MQSS) proposed by Hwange
et al. [23]. They used the so-called Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled state.
GHZ is a type of quantum superposition states with at least three particles. An example
is a three-qubit state: (|000i + |111i)/
√
2. An important property of this GHZ state is that
the trace of it over one of the particles is
Tr [(|000i + |111i) (h000| + h111|)] = |00ih00| + |11ih11| (10.22)
which is an unentangled mixed state. For three-photon maximally entangled systems there
are eight GHZ states:
|ψ1i =
1
√
2
(|000i + |111i), |ψ2i =
1
√
2
(|000i − |111i), (10.23a)
|ψ3i =

(|001i + |110i), |ψ4i =
1
√
2
(|001i − |110i), (10.23b)
|ψ5i =

(|010i + |101i), |ψ6i =

2
(|010i − |101i), (10.23c)

2
(|011i + |100i), |ψ8i =
1
√
2
(|011i − |100i) , (10.23d)
where |0i and |1i are the two eigenstates of the Z-basis {|0i, |1i}.
10.5.1 Protocol
Suppose Alice wishes to share a secret with her agents Bob and Charlie. They agree that
the four unitary operations I, σz, σx and iσy are encoded as 00, 01, 10 and 11, respectively.
The protocol essentially consists of six steps [23].
Step 1: Alice first create an ordered sequence GHZ states |ψ1i and divides them into S1,
S2 and S3. They are the set of first, second and third, respectively qubits of all GHZ states.
She sends S1 alone to Bob and nothing to Charlie.
Step 2: After receiving S1, Bob executes two actions: Making use of, say, the photon
number splitter and single photon detectors he finds out whether the received photons are
single photons. After confirming that the received photons are indeed single photons, he can
carry out any one of the operations {I, σz, σx, iσy} on each photon in S1 and then randomly
add l decoy single photons into S1. The result is, say, S
0
1
. Bob sends it to Charlie.
Step 3: In order to check the eavesdropping on S
0
1
, Bob and Charlie use the decoy single
photons to perform public discussions. They continue the protocol if no eavesdropping;
otherwise, they terminate the communication.240 Quantum Cryptography
Step 4: Alice performs one of the operations {I, σz, σx, iσy} on each photon in S2. Then
randomly inserts l decoy single photons into S2 and S3 thereby forms S
0
2 and S
0
3
. She sends
both S
0
2 and S
0
3
to Charlie.
Step 5: Alice informs the positions of the decoy single photons to Charlie and they use
them for checking eavesdropping. The protocol proceeds only if there is no eavesdropping.
Step 6: After the public discussion, Charlie does the GHZ measurement and gets the
measurement results, say, MRC. Bob and Charlie work together to get Alice’s message
using MRC and the unitary operations UB.
The above protocol can be generalized for the case of multiparties: Alice, Bob1, Bob2,
. . ., Bobm and Charlie. In this case steps 1 and 2 have to be repeated for Bob1, Bob2, . . .,
Bobm. Finally, photons are sent to Charlie from Bobm. Then Alice carries out step 4 to
encode her message and sends her photons to the final agent Charlie. In step 6, Bob1, Bob2,
. . ., Bobm and Charlie can cooperate to rebuild Alice’s message.
10.5.2 Security Analysis
Let us analyze the intercept-and-resend attack and the entangle-and-measure attack against
the above protocol.
1. Intercept-and-resend attack
In step 2, in order to check eavesdropping, Bob randomly inserts l decoy single photons
to S1. Suppose the eavesdropper attempts to measure and resend the sequence assuming
to pass the checking process of public discussion. The probability for a random guess on a
decoy single photon to overcome the public discussion is 3/4. Hence, the probability that
Eve passes the public discussion is (3/4)l
. If l is large then the probability that Eve passes
the detection is very small. Similar strategy can be made for S2 and S3. Hence, S1, S2 and
S3 can be securely communicated with the use of decoy single photons.
2. Entangle-and-measure attack
Suppose Bob tries to recover the secret message without cooperating with Charlie and
eavesdrop the Charlie’s sequence S
0
2 and S
0
3
. Bob does not know the positions and states
of the decoy photons in S
0
2 and S
0
3
. Therefore, he prepares some ancillas (extra), say, E =
{|E1i, |E2i, . . . , |Emi} and entangles them with S
0
2 and S
0
3 by enacting a unitary operation
U in order to overcome the eavesdropping check between Alice and Charlie. But this act of
Bob would give rise the following [23]:
U · |0i|Eii = α|0i|e00i + β|1i|e01i , (10.24a)
U · |1i|Eii = γ|0i|e10i + δ|1i|e11i , (10.24b)
and
U · |+i|Eii =

[ |+i(α|e00i + β|e01i + γ|e10i + δ|e11i)
+|−i(α|e00i − β|e01i + γ|e10i − δ|e11i)] , (10.24c)
U · |−i|Eii =

+|−i(α|e00i − β|e01i − γ|e10i + δ|e11i)] , (10.24d)
where UU† = U
†U = I, |Eii is initial state of Bob’s ancilla; |e00i, |e01i, |e10i and |e11i are
the four states that can be distinguished by Bob and |α

decoy photons of Alice are |0i or |1i and Bob has chosen β = γ = 0 then he would pass the
eavesdropping check. Similarly, he can escape from the check if his choice is
α|e00i − β|e01i + γ|e10i − δ|e11i
= α|e00i + β|e01i − γ|e10i − δ|e11i
= 0 (10.25)
and the decoy photons of Alice are |+i or |−i. However, for β = γ = 0, we have α|e00i −
δ|e11i = 0 which implies α|e00i = δ|e11i. That is, Bob is unable to differentiate δ|e11i from
α|e00i. Thus, he cannot measure these ancillas to get useful information about Charlie’s
shadow. On the other hand, if Bob wishes to make the ancillas differentiable, δ|e11i 6= α|e00i
then he will disturb the states of the decoy photons and will be detected in the eavesdropping
check-up.
10.5.3 A Quantum Relay
To achieve a multiparty networks quantum signals have to be routed via a backbone of
quantum nodes. For this quantum repeaters and relays are useful [24–26]. Working of a
quantum relay over 1 km of optical fiber was reported [26]. In this relay qubits have been
encoded on coherent pulses emitted by a laser. For teleportation entangled photons obtained
by means of LED were used.
The experimental set-up consists of four parts: sender, Bell-state measurement (BSM),
entangled LED (ELED) and receiver. Sender and receiver are separated by 1.05 km optical
fiber. The ELED consists of a layer of indium arsenide quantum dots within a gallium
arsenide microcavity. The ELED was driven with pulses of 0.4 V amplitude and 490 ps
duration at a repetition rate of 203 MHz. Two strong light emission from individual quantum
dots are observed and are designated as B (λ ≈ 886 nm) and X (λ ≈ 888 nm). That is, the
entangled photons are divided into two parts, X and B. The X and B photons are sent to
the receiver and BSM parts, respectively. At the sender section, from the continuous wave
laser diode pulses are produced by an optical intensity modulator. The pulses are rotated
by polarization controller (PC1) in order to encode the qubit.
At the BSM section a beam splitter (BS) is used to combine 5% of the laser photons and
95% of the B photons into one output arm. This is then sent through another polarization
controller (PC2) and a polarizing beam splitter (PBS). The horizontal (H) and vertical (V )
polarized photons are projected onto superconducting single photon detectors (SSPD) D1
and D2. The BSM section performs a Bell-state measurement in the state given by (|HLVBi+
|VLHBi)/
√
2. Here B and L denote the photons from the biexciton and laser, respectively.
The input qubits cos a|HLi+eib
sin a|VLi are teleported as cos a|VXi+eib
sin a|HXi, where X
denotes formerly entangled photon. Correlation measurements can be carried out in {H, V }
and diagonal {D, A} linear polarization bases, where D and A denote the diagonal and
anti-diagonal polarizations, respectively. Then one can find Bell’s parameter to point out
the degree of entanglement. For more details refer [26].
10.6 Applications of Quantum Cryptography
In this section we point out a few promising applications of quantum cryptography [27].242 Quantum Cryptography
(i) Secure communication
The best application of cryptography [27] is to allow a secure communication. In the near
future, quantum cryptography may be used in top-secret applications in the military, for
example, as the basis of communication links.
(ii) Protection of private information
The second application is the protection of private information during public discussion
[27]. Suppose two businessmen wish to do a joint venture−but are able to do so only if
their total available capital is more than, say, 100 million. Both firms want to know if this
condition is satisfied, but neither wishes to share the exact amount of capital that he is
committing. In classical cryptography, the firms can only execute the deal if they have
trusted intermediaries. It has been believed that quantum cryptography would be able to
remove these assumptions and provide unconditional security.
(iii) Public key cryptography
Another important nonmilitary application of cryptography is public key cryptography.
This in its classical version forms the backbone of e-commerce on the internet. Public
key cryptosystems are special in that they allow two people, who have not yet met, to
communicate securely by looking-up encryption methods in a public directory.
10.7 Implementation and Limitations
How do we achieve quantum cryptography in practice? The best candidates for performing
the different quantum states are photons. They are easy to produce and transmit using
optical fibers. Over the 20 years the attenuation of light at a wavelength of 1300 km has
been reduced from several decibels per metre of fiber to just 0.35 decibels per kilometer.
That is, photons can travel about 10 km in a fiber before half of them get absorbed. This is
sufficient for quantum cryptography in local networks. Note that amplifiers cannot be used
to transmit the photons (why?). There are limitations in achieving quantum cryptography
in practice. They are given below [27]:
1. The current distance over which photons have been sent securely down optical
fibers is at only about 50 Km and is too short.
2. The signals required for cryptography can only be sent via fibers at rates of kilo￾bites per second. This rate is several thousands of times slower than standard
single-mode optical fibers.
3. Current quantum cryptography systems are very expensive whereas present
software-based encryption method are essentially free.
4. Equipment needed to prepare quantum cryptographic signals is large.
In order to overcome the above technical difficulties considerable developments are nec￾essary before the cost and the data rate of quantum cryptographic devices can compete
with conventional ones.Fiber-Optical Quantum Key Distribution 243

10.8 Fiber-Optical Quantum Key Distribution
A commercially available quantum key distribution (QKD) prototype that allows key ex￾change about 67 km distance was developed by Stucki et al. [28]. The block diagram of the
set-up is shown in Fig. 10.4. We present the features of the system. In Fig. 10.4 BS a PBS
are 50 : 50 beam splitter and a polarization beam splitter, respectively. PMB is a phase
modulator and DL is a 50 ns delay time unit. A strong laser pulse (@1550 nm) was emitted
at Bob. First it was split into two pulses by the beam splitter BS. They went through a
long arm and a short arm, including DL and PMB, respectively. These two pulses were
incident on the input ports of PBS. The optical elements and the fibers were maintained
with polarization. In the short arm, the polarization was kept at 90◦
. The pulses came out
from Bob’s set-up through the same port of the polarization beam splitter. They travelled
to Alice and first reflected on a Faraday mirror. Then they were attenuated and returned
back with polarized orthogonally. Next, they followed the other path to Bob and reached at
the same time at the 50 : 50 beam splitter and interfered. They were detected either in D1 or
in D2 after allowing them to pass through the circulator C. In employing the BB84 scheme,
the phase-shift of 0 and π and π/2 or 3π/2 were introduced by Alice on the second pulse
with PMA. Bob used the measurement basis making a 0 or π/2-shift on the first pulse on
its return. With the above, key exchange over different installed cables have been studied.
Secure key exchange was successfully realized over 67 km (between Geneva and Lausanne).
10.9 Quantum Cheque Scheme
In 1969 Stephen Wiesner [29] introduced the idea of quantum money. A quantum cheque
scheme (QCS) was proposed [30]. In this scheme a bank acts as a centre of key generation244 Quantum Cryptography
and gives a quantum analogue of the cheque book secretly to its account holders. An account
holder can issue cheques and they can be verified by the bank or any of its branches with
which the bank accepts to share a classical communication channel. Quantum cheques can
be realized through physical devices with the use of quantum memories. Before presenting
the QCS, let us present the cryptographic tools needed to realize it.
A. Quantum One Way Functions
We can define a quantum one way function as Ψ : k × |0i
⊗n −→ |ψki, where k ∈ {0, 1}
∗
and |ψki is a n-qubit quantum state. Further, assume that
1. Ψ is easy to compute, for example, through a polynomial-time algorithm. It is
possible to evaluate Ψ(k, |0i
⊗n) and get the outputs |ψki and
2. Ψ is difficult to invert, that is, it is difficult to compute k if |ψki is given.
B. Digital Signatures
A digital signature scheme Π is essentially a 6-tuple (M,P, U, G, S, V ) where
• M is a finite set of valid messages,
•
P is a finite set of valid signatures,
• U is a finite set of users,
• G is a key generation algorithm which takes a security parameter 1k and provides
the outputs S, V algorithms and the public parameters,
• S is the signing algorithm and is a mapping: M × U →
P and
• V is the verification algorithm and V : M ×
P×U → {True, False}.
For all k and m ∈ M and for users i and j we have Vj (m, Si(m), Ui) = True. For an
adversary it would be impossible to produce a valid signature except with an inappreciable
probability. Similarly, the signer would not be able to deny a legitimate signature except
with an inappreciable probability.
C. Quantum Cheque
The essential properties of a cheque are:
1. The authenticity of a cheque can be verified by a trusted bank or its branches.
2. After issuing a cheque the issuer must not be able to disapprove it.
3. An adversary will not be able to counterfeit the issued cheque.
4. An adversary will not be able to use a cheque more than once to withdraw money.
A typical QCS consists of the following three stages:
1. G: With a security parameter as an input a cheque book and a key for the user
are probabilistically generated.
2. S: A quantum state χ called a cheque is produced considering the key of the
issuer and the amount to be signed as inputs.
3. V : The validity of the cheque is decided treating the key of the user and the
cheque as the inputs.Quantum Cheque Scheme 245
D. Scheme
For simplicity let us consider the scheme with the parties Alice (customer), Bob (vendor)
and the bank. The branches of the bank are assumed to be connected to the main branch of
the bank through a securred classical channel. Here by bank we refers to the main branch
of the bank. The trusted party is the main branch.
Alice issues a cheque to Bob who then submits it to the bank or to one of its branches
to encash. Bank verifies the validity of the cheque. The G, S and V schemes are described
in the following.
G: Alice and the bank share a key, say, k, only once using an efficient protocol like
BB84 or by any other securred manner. They agree on a secure digital signature
scheme Π = (G, S, V ). Alice submit her public key pk to the bank and also stores
secretly her private key sk.
The bank then prepares a string of l, say, GHZ, states as

10.10 Concluding Remarks
Quantum cryptography is the first application of quantum mechanics at the single-quantum
level. It is based on a beautiful combination of concepts from information theory and quan￾tum physics. Progress in quantum cryptography is found to be rapid. Several researchersBibliography 247
have proved that it is indeed possible to send messages securely with different protocols in
the presence of noise. Information has been sent over a distance of a few kilometers through
the open air. Real experiments to transmit quantum signals to satellites have also been pro￾posed. Most of the difficulties mentioned earlier can be overcome. Several groups are actively
involved in solving them. In a short time, it is highly feasible that quantum cryptography
will be absorbed for top-secret applications. In the past, some classical cryptosystems have
been broken. This would be impossible if the quantum cryptography is implemented.
A quantum cryptosystem can be of use to design smart cards authenticate ID and
medical IC smart cards, withdrawals, deposits and transfers. The quantum cryptosystem
can greatly enhance the security of smart cards and more over it can avoid calculations.
In view of this a processor will not be needed and manufacturing cost can be considerably
decreased. A quantum cryptosystem can be utilized to develop an information security
software system [31–33] which can improve for example e-commerce technology [34,35],
national defence and expected to promote development of high technology.

No-Cloning Theorem and Quantum
Cloning Machines
11.1 Introduction
Quantum mechanics is a linear theory. So, a quantum state is a superposition state. In
classical information theory the bits 0 and 1 carry information. But in quantum information
theory a qubit is a superposition of the two states |0i and |1i. A general qubit takes the
form α|0i+β|1i with |α|
2+|β|
2 = 1. Any measurement by an operator on this superposition
state will lead to collapse of the quantum state to any of its eigenstate with a probability.
Consequently, a quantum state cannot be copied like a classical state. Any arbitrary qubit
cannot be duplicated without destroying the original. William Wooters and Wojciech Zurek
[1] proved this impossibility by copying a quantum state wave function and it is called
no-cloning theorem. It leads to a lot of consequences in quantum information processing.
Due to this theorem a string of qubits cannot be processed more than one way. But this
feature of quantum mechanics helps quantum cryptography as there is no way for someone
to perfectly copy the quantum information. No-cloning theorem makes it possible to detect
any eavesdropper on a quantum communication channel.
Let U be a quantum operation which duplicates an arbitrary pure state |ψi as [2]
U (|ψi ⊗ |Ri ⊗ |Mi) = |ψi ⊗ |ψi ⊗ |M(ψ)i. (11.1)
|Ri is an unknown initial state of the cloning machine and |Mi is the initial state of the
axiliary state (ancilla). The axiliary state |M(ψ)i is obtained after operation and it depends
on |ψi. If there exists such a machine to perform U then any number of copies of |ψi can be
obtained. But no-cloning theorem says that such a machine cannot be built. This limitation
arises, not due to the experimental limitations of designing such a machine but due to the
inherent properties of quantum states.
This chapter begins by providing proofs of no-cloning and no-broadcasting theorems.
Then the features of some of the quantum cloning machines are presented. Next, a tele￾cloning scheme that can teleport an unknown 1-qubit to M associates is considered. Finally,
certain no-go theorems are defined.
11.2 Proof of No-Cloning Theorem
No-cloning theorem states that no quantum operation exists which can perfectly and de￾terministically duplicate a pure state. We give here two methods to prove the theorem
[2].
DOI: 10.1201/9781003172192-11 251252 No-Cloning Theorem and Quantum Cloning Machines
Method-1
This was given first by Wooters and Zurek [1] and also by Dennis Geert Bernardus Johan
Dieks [3]. It makes use of linearity of quantum mechanics. Let us assume a perfect cloning
machine which can copy an arbitrary quantum state |ψi as
|ψi|Σi|Mi → |ψi|ψi|M(ψ)i (11.2)
exists. As given in Eq. (11.1) |Σi is a blank state (onto which one could copy an unknown
state) and |Mi is the state of the auxiliary system. Such a cloning machine will copy
|0i|Σi|Mi → |0i|0i|M(0)i, |1i|Σi|Mi → |1i|1i|M(1)i. (11.3)
As quantum mechanics admits the superposition state |φi = α|0i+β|1i this cloning machine
will give
(α|0i + β|1i)|Σi|Mi → α|00i|M(0)i + β|11i|M(1)i. (11.4)
But |φi = α|0i + β|1i is a pure state. Therefore,
|φi|Σi|Mi
U
−→ ￾
α

|00i + αβ|01i + βα|10i + β

|M(φ)i, (11.5)
where U is the unitary cloning operator. Right-hand-side of Eq. (11.5) is not equal to the
right-hand-side of Eq. (11.4). So it can be concluded that our assumption of a cloning
machine with operation given by Eq. (11.2) does not exist.
Method-2
This method makes use of the properties of operators to prove the no-cloing theorem.
Horace Pak-Hong Yuen [4] proposed first this proof. Suppose the quantum cloner is prepared
in a state |si which does not depend on the unknown state |ψi to be copied. Let |0i be a
known state of a particle onto which the information has to be copied and U be the unitary
cloning operator. Denote the state of the quantum copies after |ψi and |ψi have been cloned
as |s
0
i and |s
00i, respectively. The cloning process for the two initial states |ψi and |ψi are
written as
U(|ψi|0i|si) = |ψi|ψi|s
0
i, (11.6)
U(|ψi|0i|si) = |ψi|ψi|s
00i. (11.7)
Equation (11.7) can be rewritten as
(hs|h0|hψ|)U
−1 = hs
00|hψ|hψ|. (11.8)
Multiplication of Eq. (11.6) by Eq. (11.8) gives
hψ|ψi = hψ|ψi
2
hs
00|s
0
i. (11.9)
Since the magnitude of hψ|ψi and hs
00|s
0
i must be ≤ 1 Eq. (11.9) is satisfied only if |hψ|ψi| =
|hs
00|s
0
i| = 1 or zero. Therefore, perfect cloning is possible only if |ψi and |ψi are either
orthogonal or identical. Thus, we conclude that ideal cloning device for arbitrary states
does not exist.
The no-cloning theorem is manifested in several versions. In terms of CNOT gate we
have the relations [2]
CNOT(σx ⊗ I)CNOT = σx ⊗ σx, (11.10a)
CNOT(I ⊗ σx)CNOT = I ⊗ σx, (11.10b)
CNOT(σz ⊗ I)CNOT = σz ⊗ I, (11.10c)
CNOT(I ⊗ σz)CNOT = σz ⊗ σz. (11.10dNo-Broadcasting Theorem 253
These relations imply that the bit flip operation can be copied from first qubit to the second
qubit and the phase flip operation can be copied backwards. However, they cannot be copied
simultaneously.
11.3 No-Broadcasting Theorem
We have seen that no-cloning theorem is applicable only to pure states. It is impossible to
clone a mixed state described by the density matrix [5]. As pure states and mixed states
exclude each other, none of the proof for these two classes of states can be derivable from
one another. We give below the original no-broadcasting theorem for the non-commuting
states proposed in [5].
Let AB be a composite quantum system having two parts A and B. A is prepared in one
of the states {σi} while B is prepared in the blank state τ . A general broadcasting machine
copies a state of the unknown quantum system to be broadcasted to a target system. If G
is the quantum operation performed on the composite system AB as
σk ⊗ τ −→ G(σk ⊗ τ ) = ρ
out
k
(11.11)
and the output state satisfies
Traρ
out
k = σk and Trbρ
out
k = σk (11.12)
then we say that G broadcasts the set of states {σi}.
Barnum’s theorem [5] states that a set of states {σi} can be broadcasted if and only
if the states {σi} commute with each other . This proof closely follows the proof given in
[6], where the property of relative entropy from the fundamental principle of information
theory has been used. This theorem has been proved in certain ways [2,5–8]. We give the
proof of the theorem given in [2], where the set {σi} is considered to have only two states
σ1 and σ2.
Let us give the proof for the if part first. As σ1 and σ2 commute they have simultaneous
eigenfunctions. Let {|ii} be their simultaneous eigenfunctions. So σ1 and σ2 can be expressed
in the same orthogonal basis {|ii} as
σk =
X
i
λk,i|iihi|, k = 1, 2. (11.13)
{|ii} is an orthonormal set for the cloning operation G. Therefore, we get
ρ
out
k = G (σk ⊗ τ ) = X
i
λk,i|iiihii|, k = 1, 2. (11.14)
Taking the trace for the source state and the target state we have
Traρ
out
k = σk and Trbρ
out
k = σk. (11.15)
We find that σ1 and σ2 are broadcasted by the broadcasting operator G.
Next, we give the proof for only if part of the Barnum’s theorem. This proof is based
on the concept of relative entropy [9]. The relative entropy of a state ρ1 with respect to
another ρ2 is defined as
S(ρ1|ρ2) = Tr [ρ1 (ln ρ1 − ln ρ2)] . (11.16)254 No-Cloning Theorem and Quantum Cloning Machines
It measures the closeness between ρ1 and ρ2. For pair of states which are perfectly distin￾guishable S(ρ1|ρ2) = ∞. We consider only the cases where S < ∞. With ρ
in
1 = σ1 ⊗ τ and
ρ
in
2 = σ2 ⊗ τ , we obtain
S(ρ1|ρ2) = Tr [σ1 ⊗ τ (ln σ1 ⊕ ln τ − ln σ2 ⊕ ln τ )]
= Tra [σ1 (ln σ1 − ln σ2)] Trbτ
= Tra [σ1 (ln σ1 − ln σ2)]
= S(σ1|σ2). (11.17)
Equation (11.17) proves that the relative entropy of the two initial states is exclusively given
by the relative entropy of the two source systems. As the cloning operation G is a unitary
operation U, on the input state ρ
in
a and the ancillary state Σ, we can write

The relative entropy of the final states of any two broadcasting processes is equal to the
relative entropy of the sources prior to copying. We can prove that Eq. (11.19) is violated
using the theorem of monotonicity of relative entropy [10]. With ρ

Equation (11.24) will be satisfied only when σ1 and σ2 are diagonal or they can be diag￾onalized in the same eigenfunction space. So, σ1 and σ2 must commute. We proved that
a realization of a broadcasting machine may be possible only provided all its input states
are mutually commuting. For any two non-commuting arbitrary states, the inequality in
Eq. (11.20) holds good in contradiction with Eq. (11.19). No-broadcasting is possible as
the monotonicity of relative entropy is in conflict with quantum dynamics. No-broadcasting
theorem can also be extended to the case of S(ρ1|ρ2) = ∞ [6].

11.4 No-Cloning and No-Superluminar Signalling
According to relativity, no superluminar signalling (faster-than-light) is physically possible.
Let a composite system AB is in an entangled state then any action on system B which
takes place and is completed at a space-like separation from system A affects this system
instantaneously. It has been thought that this instantaneous repsonse of observer A with a
space-like separation from B for the action at B can be used for faster-than-light signalling.
A large number of proposals taking advantage of entanglement and the collapse of the
wave packet upon measurement appeared in the literature. Those proposals aimed to ex￾ploit this possibility for superluminal communication and to prove the incompatability of
quantum mechanics with special theory of relativity. In 1982 Nick Herbert [11] proposed
an interesting and quite a different way for faster-than-light signalling by using a hypothet￾ical machine which could perform the task of creating many copies of an arbitrary state
of quantum system. This suggestion triggered the derivation of no-cloning theorem which
proved that the proposal of Herbert was unviable.
Let us outline the idea of the proposal of Herbert [2]. Assume that Alice and Bob
separated at an arbitrary distance (even the distance may be space-like) share a pair of
entangled qubits in the state |ψ
−i = (|01i − |10i)/
√
2 . Alice can measure her qubit using
σx or σz If σz is measured in |ψ
−i then there is a probability of 50% for Alice qubit to
collapse to the state |0i or |1i. So, this measurement by Alice prepares the qubit of Bob
in the state |1i if Alice’s measurement collapses her state to |0i and in the state |0i if the
measurement of Alice collapses her state to |1i. Therefore, without knowing the results of
the measurement of Alice the density matrix of qubit of Bob is 1
2
|0ih0| +
1
2
|1ih1| = I/2.
Now, suppose Alice measures σx. The qubit of Alice will collapse to one of its eigenvectors
|φx+i = (|0i + |1i)/
√
2 or |φx−i = (|0i − |1i)/
√
2 . Then the qubit of Bob is prepared in
the state |φx−i or |φx+i, respectively. In this case also the density matrix of qubit of Bob
is 1
2
|φx+ihφx+| +
1
2
|φx−ihφx−| = I/2. So, Bob gets no information about the measurement
made by Alice as Bob gets the same density matrix for both σz and σx measur256 No-Cloning Theorem and Quantum Cloning Machines
Imagine a perfect cloning machine is available to Bob. He can then make arbitrary many
copies of his qubit and able to determine the exact state of his qubit, that is, whether an
eigenstate of σz or σx. Using this information Bob can know the type of measurement Alice
has done. As no-cloning theorem says that no such copying machine is possible, this type of
superluminal signalling scheme cannot be physically realized. Thus, the no-cloning theorem
makes quantum mechanics not to contradict the theory of relativity.
11.5 Quantum Cloning Machines
No-cloning theorem forbids a deterministic and perfect cloner for any arbitrary quantum
state. This theorem proved that two non-orthogonal states cannot be cloned. It has been
shown that two non-commuting mixed states cannot be broadcasted. No-cloning theorem
has also been proved for the entangled states. In spite of the no-cloning theorem, it is quite
possible to construct a quantum cloning machine (QCM) which copies an unknown state
approximately.
As a QCM copies an unknown state approximately, a figure of merit has to be defined
and the output of the QCM must be evaluated based on it. The usual figure of merit is
called fidelity. The process of cloning of pure states to the case of N → M closing is defined
as [12]
￾
|ψi
⊗N

⊗
￾
|Ri
⊗M−N

⊗ (|Mi)
U−→ |ψi, (11.26)
where |ψi is the state of the Hilbert space H to be copied, |Ri is a reference arbitrary state
chosen in the same H and |Mi is the ancilla state. For each of the outputs j = 1, 2, . . . , M
of the cloning machine the fidelity Fj is defined as the overlap between ρj and the initial
state |ψi. That is, Fj is given by [12]
Fj = hψ|ρj |ψi, j = 1, 2, . . . , M, (11.27)
where ρj is the partial state of clone j in the state |ψi defined by Eq. (11.26).
QCMs are classified according to the nature of the fidelity Fj . A QCM is called universal
(UQCM) if it copies equally well for any arbitrary input state and for this the fidelity Fj
is independent of |ψi. Nonuniversal QCMs are called state-dependent. If all the clones at
the output have same fidelity then the QCM is named as symmetric. If the fidelities of
the clones are the maximal ones allowed by quantum mechanics for a given fidelity of the
original state then such a QCM is called optimal.
11.5.1 Symmetric UQCM for Qubit
We give two cloning strategies for quantum cloning from one qubit to two qubits [12]. In
the first cloning strategy, the qubit is measured in a randomly chosen basis and two copies
of the state corresponding to the outcome are produced. If the original state is | + ai the
projector of which is 1
2
(1 + a · σ) then the eigenstates of b · σ are the measurement basis.
Two copies of | ± bi are produced with the probability P =
1
2
(1 ± a · b). The fidelity for
both cases are
F± = |ha| ± bi|2 = P±. (11.28)
The average fidelity of this case is

, (11.2Quantum Cloning Machines 257
where S2 is the surface of the Bloch sphere. This cloning is universal as we will get the same
fidelity for any arbitrary original state | + ai.
In the second cloning strategy, let the original qubit | + ai is unperturbed and give a
new qubit in a randomly chosen state |+bi. When we detect one particle the original state
| + ai will have a probability 1
2 with fidelity 1 and the new state will have the probability
1
2 with the fidelity F = |h+a| + bi|2 = P+. We get the average single-copy fidelity for this
second strategy as

The second strategy is also universal. Vladimir Buˇzek and Mark Hillery [13] proposed an
optimal UQCM which outperforms these two cloning strategies.
11.5.2 Buˇzek–Hillery Optimal Symmetric UQCM
Buˇzek and Hillery introduced a UQCM which produces two identical copies with quality
independent of the input state. It has been shown that this UQCM was optimal [14]. It
has the maximum average fidelity between the input and output states. Buˇzek and Hillery
proposed an optimal UQCM by a unitary transformation U on a larger Hilbert space as
U|0i1|0i2|0iR =
r
2
3
|0i1|0i2|0iR +
r
1
6
(|0i1|1i2 + |1i1|0i2)|1iR (11.31)
and
U|1i1|0i2|0iR =

2
3
|1i1|1i2|1iR +
r
1
6
(|0i1|1i2 + |1i1|0i2)|0iR. (11.32)
On the left-hand-side of the Eqs. (11.31) and (11.32) the input state is the first qubit and
the second qubit is the blank state. Further, the qubit with the subindex R is the ancillary
state of the QCM. In the transformation U of the cloning machine, the original qubit is
destroyed. It becomes as one of the output qubit in 1 and the blank state is changed to
another copy in party 2. The ancillary state may change or may not change. It will be traced
out for the output. As the two outputs are identical it is a symmetric cloning machine. For
any arbitrary normalized pure input state |ψi = a|0i + b|1i, U defined by Eqs. (11.31) and
(11.32), we can find the density matrix of the output state after tracing out the ancillary
state as

where |ψ

in Eq. (11.33) we will get the single copy density matrix
ρ1 = ρ2 =

|ψihψ| +
I

. (11.34)
The input state |ψi can be written as cos(θ/2)|0i + eiφ
sin(θ/2)|1i. We measure the quality
of the copies by their fidelity

Substituting Eq. (11.34) in Eq. (11.35) we get the fidelity for Buˇzek–Hillery copying machine
as F = 5/6. As the single copy fidelity does not depend on input state the quality of the
copies has the state-independent characteristic and hence this cloning machine is universal.
A symmetric universal N → M QCM for qubits which generalizes Buˇzek–Hillery QCM
was proposed [14] with the transformation for this cloning machine as
U|Nψi|Ri =
M
X−N
j=0
αj |(M − j)ψ, jψ⊥i|Rj i, (11.36a)
where
αj =

N + 1
M + 1s
(M − N)!(M − j)!
(M − N − j)!M!
(11.36b)
with |(M − j)ψ, jψ⊥) denoting the normalized symmetric state with M − j states |ψi and
j states |ψ
⊥i. The single copy fidelity for this copying machine is found to be
F =
M(N + 1) + N
M(N + 2) . (11.37)
Equation (11.37) gives the upper bound of N → M UQCM and hence this UQCM is
optimal.

Trace out the states in Eq. (11.33) and prove Eq. (11.34).

11.5.3 Asymmetric UQCM
In asymmetric UQCM the output clones possibly have different fidelities. For 1 → 1 + 1
cloning the optimum symmmetric UQCM was found [15]. Similar copying machines were also
developed [16] with a slightly different formulation but giving the same no-cloning inequality
relation between the fidelities FA and FB of the two outputs A and B, respectively, as
p
(1 − FA)(1 − FB) ≥
1
2
− (1 − FA) − (1 − FB). (11.40)Quantum Cloning Machines 259
Equation (11.40) was proved to be optimal. If the fidelity of one output is increased, the
fidelity of the other output will be decreased. The transformation of the asymmetric UQCM
is given as [17]

a and b are real and for the input state to be normalized they must satisfy the condition

ρA,B = FA,B|ψihψ| + (1 − FA,B)|ψ

For a = b = 1/
√
3, we will get the symmetric case of Buˇzek–Hillery with FA = FB = 5/6.
11.5.4 Probabilistic Quantum Cloning
All the cloning machines that we have discussed so far can always succeed but the copies
cannot be perfect. A probabilistic cloning machine has been proposed [18] which can succeed
only with a probability. When it succeeds it will give a perfect copy. This probabilistic
quantum cloning is much useful in studying the B92 quantum key distribution protocol
which involves only two non-orthogonal states and we can try to clone it with the largest
probability. Suppose S = {|ψ0i, |ψ1i} are the two independent states to be copied. The
cloning transformation proposed is
U (|ψ0i|Σi|mpi) = √
η0 |ψ0i|ψ0i|m0i +
p
1 − η0 |Φ

ABP i, (11.44a)

η1 |ψ1i|ψ1i|m1i +
p

ABP i, (11.44b)
where |mpi, |m0i and |m1i are ancillary states. The states |Φ
0
ABP i and |Φ
1
ABP i are chosen
so that the reduced state of P is orthogonal to |m0i and |m1i. If the measurements are
|m0i or |m1i then we know that the states S = {|ψ0i, |ψ1i} are copied perfectly. Otherwise,
the cloning has not succeeded. The probability of success is η0 for the state |ψ0i and η1 for
state |ψ1i. For further studies on probabilistic QCM one may refer to the refs. [19–23].
11.5.5 The Pauli Channel
Let us present the QCM called Pauli channel [2,16]. Consider an arbitrary quantum pure
state |ψi = x0|0i + x1|1i, |x1|
2 + |x2|
2 = 1. A maximally entangled state is given by
|ψ

11.6 Quantum Telecloning
A telecloning scheme combines cloning with teleportation. In teleportation an arbitrary
state describing a quantum system is transmitted from a recipient (Alice) to another (Bob).
In telecloning Alice holds an unknown state which she wishes to teleclone to M associates,
Bob, Claire, etc. A quantum telecloning system for two-level system in which one input is
sent to M-receivers has been proposed [24]. The case of distribution of N identical inputs
among M receivers is reported [18]. The two-level system scheme is extended for the d-level
case [25]. In this section we give Murao quantum cloning scheme [24] for teleporting an
unknown 1-qubit |φiX to M associates.
Teleportation has been discussed more elaborately in chapter 15. Here we give the basic
protocol of teleportation in which an unknown state |φiX of a quantum system X is to be
faithfully transmitted between Alice and Bob who are spatially separated. In an 1-qubit
system Alice and Bob share a maximally entangled state of two qubits A and B, such as
|Φ
+i = (|00iAB + |11iAB)/
√
2. After this Alice does a joint measurement of the 2-qubit
X ⊗ A in the Bell states
|Φ
±i =
1
√
2
(|00i ± |11i), |Ψ
±i =
1
√
2
(|01i ± |10i). (11.54)
After performing this measurement Alice sends a two-bit message to Bob informing him of
her measurement result. At the receiving end Bob rotates his qubit by the unitary operators
I, σz, σx or σy according to whether Alice’s result was |Φ
+i, |Φ
−i, |Ψ+i or |Ψ−i, respectively.
Then regardless of the measurement result the final state of the qubit of Bob will be equal
to the original state |φiX. Telecloning scheme makes use of the property of this insensitivity
to the measurment results.
Next, we have to incorporate a optimal UQC (OUQC) into the telecloning system. We
have already discussed Buˇzek–Hillery OUQC for producing two copies with the optimal
fidelity of 5/6. A N − M UQCM in which the copying machine performs unitary transfor￾mations that transform N input systems which are identically prepared in state |φini onto
M output system (M ≥ N) has been proposed [14]. Each of the M output state is a mixed
state with the reduced density operator
ρout = F|φinihφin| + (1 − F)|φ
⊥
inihφ
⊥
in|, (11.55)
where hφin|φ
⊥
ini = 0, that is, |φ
⊥
ini is orthogonal to |φini. The fidelity factor is given by
Eq. (11.37).
In telecloning only one original qubit is sent and hence N = 1. If |φini = a|0i+b|1i then
the cloning transformation is given with M − N blank qubits prepared in some fixed state
|00 . . . 0iB and an ancilla system containing at least M − N + 1 levels in some fixed state
|00 . . . 0iA as
U1M (|φini ⊗ |00 . . . 0iA|00 . . . 0iB) = a|φ0iAC + b|φ1iAC , (11.56)262 No-Cloning Theorem and Quantum Cloning Machines

M(M + 1) . (11.59)
In the above equations C denotes the M qubits holding the copies, |Aj iA are M orthonormal
states of the ancilla. | {0, M − j} , {1, j}i represents the symmetric and normalized state of
M qubits. Out of these M qubits (M − j) of them are in the |0i state while j are in the
state |1i. The ancilla qubits can be represented as the symmetrical states of (M − 1) qubits
as
|Aj iA = | {0, M − 1 − j} , {j, 1}iA. (11.60)
Then states |φ0i and |φ1i become (2M − 1) qubits obeying the following symmetries:
σz ⊗ . . . ⊗ σz|φ0i = |φ0i, σz ⊗ . . . ⊗ σz|φ1i = −|φ1i, (11.61a)
σx ⊗ . . . ⊗ σx|φ0i = |φ1i, σx ⊗ . . . ⊗ σx|φ1i = |φ0i. (11.61b)
We find that |φ0i and |φ1i transform under simultaneous action of Pauli operators on all
(2M − 1) qubits like |0i and |1i transform under the corresponding single Pauli operator.
In the telecloning scheme proposed in [24] Alice has an unknown 1-qubit state |φiX and
she has to teleclone it to M associates Bob, Claire etc. All of them must share a multiparticle
entangled state |ψTCi as a starting resource. This entangled state is needed for each of the
M associates to get an optimal copy given by Eq. (11.55) after performing local rotations
with Pauli operators once Alice performs a local measurement and informs its results to
them. A |ψTCi having these properties is
|ψTCi =

C denotes the M qubits holding the copies with each copy is held by one of the M associates.
A represents M −1 qubit ancilla assumed to be on Alice’s side. A single qubit held by Alice
is denoted by P and is called port qubit. We will get a (2M + 1) qubit state if we take the
tensor product of |ψTCi with the unknown state |φiX = a|0iX + b|1iX. We can rewrite in
the Bell basis of qubits X and P as

Now, telecloning can be accomplished by performing local rotation operations with theOther No-Go Theorems 263
Pauli spin operators at the receiving end. When Alice performs a Bell measurement of qubit
X and P she will get one of the four results |Φ
±i, |Ψ±i. Assume that |Φ
+iXP is the result of
her measurement then AC is projected into the state given by Eq. (11.56) (optimal cloning
state). This achieves our task. In case other Bell states are obtained by Alice measurements
then the associates can still recover the correct state of AC by making use of the Pauli
matrix operations of Eqs. (11.61). For |Φ
−iXP , σz operation on the 2M − 1 qubits in
AC must be performed. Like-wise, for |ψ
+iXP or |Ψ−iXP , σx and σxσz operations must be
performed, respectively, to recover the correct state. We find that given the telecloning state
Eq. (11.62) and using only local operations and classical communication of the measuremed
result by Alice we are able to optimally transform information from one to several qubits.

11.7 Other No-Go Theorems
Apart from no-cloning there are a few other impossibilities in quantum information. The
impossibility theorems are consequences of linearity and unitarity properties of quantum
theory. We briefly point out the various no-go theorems.
1. No-Hiding Theorem
As per the no-hiding theorem [26] if information is found to be missing in one system, for
example due to the interaction of the system with the environment, then it is residing some￾where else in the universe. This means it is not possible to hide the missing information in
the correlations between a system and its environment. This theorem addressing about in￾formation loss has been proven experimentally [27] on a 3-qubit NMR quantum information
processor. The no-hiding theorem is found to have applications in black hole evaporation,
quantum teleportation and private quantum channels.
2. No-Deletion Theorem
A given finite number of copies of an unknown quanta state can be partly estimated [28,29]
and teleported. But, similar to cloning, deletion of an unknown state from several copies
is also not allowed. This is known as no-deletion principle [30]. Note that if cloning and
deletion of an unknown state are possible then we can transmit signals faster than light
using two pairs of EPR states.264 No-Cloning Theorem and Quantum Cloning Machines
3. No-Splitting Theorem
Another impossibility theorem is the no-splitting problem [31]. It has been proven that
quantum information of an unknown qubit cannot be split into two complementary qubits
in a product state. This implies that the information contained in one qubit is inseparable.
4. No-Partial Erase Theorem
According to the no-erase theorem it is impossible to erase quantum information partially
[31]. Here partial erasure refers to reduction of the dimension of the parameter space for
the quantum state representing the quantum information, such as a qubit. Suppose a qubit
contains information about, say, azimuthal angle and polar angle: |Ωi = cos(θ/2)|0i +
e
iφ
sin(θ/2)|1i, with Ω = (θ, φ), θ ∈ [0, π] and φ ∈ [0, 2π]. Here the states |0i and |1i are
the logical zero and one states. Each pure state can be a point on the Poincar´e sphere with
θ and φ being the polar and azimuthal angles, respectively. It is impossible to erase, for
example, polar angle information keeping the information about the azimuthal angle. In the
above, complete erasure would result in mapping of all qubit states into a fixed qubit state
|Ω0i = |Σi whatever the values of θ and φ.
11.8 Concluding Remarks
No-cloning theorem makes it impossible to clone a quantum state perfectly. But a lot of
attention has been paid to the possibility of producing copies close to the original state.
The first approximate cloning protocol was proposed for 1 → 2 symmetric cloning of a
completely unknown qubit state with the optimal fidelity of 5/6. It was later generalized
to N − M cloning of an arbitrary state. Asymmetric cloning machines with the output
clones having different fidelities were investigated. Many other cloning machines such as
state-dependent cloning, phase-covariant QCMs, probabilistic QCMs have been studied. In
[2] a detailed account of various cloning machines and their applications has been presented.
QCMs have been realized by various schemes experimentally. They have been implemented
experimentally in NMR system, in a single photon with different degrees of freedom and
also in optical system. Apart from using QCMs in quantum teleportation they can be used
in metrology. Optical cloning machines can be used as radiometer to measure the amount
of radiated power. Of course the most important application of QCM is on state estimation
and eavesdropping of quantum cryptography.

Quantum Tomography
12.1 Introduction
The complete information about a state of a physical system is obtained by all possible mea￾surements on the system. One can do any number of measurements on a classical system and
determine the state of the system. For example, measurements of position and momentum
of an oscillating pendulum can be used to find the complete trajectory of the pendulum.
This is possible as our measurements do not affect the classical system in any way. But in
quantum mechanics there are inherent limitations due to Heisenberg uncertainty principle
and also due to no-cloning theorem. Our measurements on any quantum state alters the
state and hence repeated measurements cannot be done on any initial quantum state. Mea￾surements on a perfect copy of the initial state cannot also be possible as the no-cloning
theorem forbids creation of a perfect copy of any quantum state.
Consider an ensemble of a number of identical copies of an unknown state |ψi. The
ensemble can be written as the direct product of copies of the unknown state as
|ψi
⊗n = ⊗
n
|ψi = |ψi ⊗ |ψi ⊗ . . . ⊗ |ψi (up to n terms). (12.1)
As the individual copies in the direct product are independent, performing several different
measurements on many copies of the state, one can get fairly a good idea about the state
|ψi. If we could construct such an ensemble of identical state then we can solve the problem
of characterizing an unknown state |ψi. Unfortunately, it is impossible to copy a given
state and construct an ensemble |ψi
⊗n due to no-cloning theorem and hence this process of
determining the unknown state is impossible.
Suppose that we can prepare a quantum system repeatedly in the same state. Assume
that each one of the prepared quantum system is a mixed state described by the density
matrix ρ. Quantum tomography aims to determine the state of the system by determining
its density matrix ρ by means of a series of measurements done on fairly a large number of
identically prepared copies of the same system. The term tomography originates from the
Greek word tomos meaning part and graphein meaning to write. As the classical tomography
aims at reconstructing three-dimensional images via a series of two-dimensional projections
along various dimensions, it is possible to determine the unknown quantum state of a system
if many identical copies are available in the same state by performing different measurements
in each copy.
Ugo Fano [1] in 1957 first addressed the problem of finding the procedure to determine
the state of a system from multiple copies by defining a sufficient set of observables called
quorum for a complete determination of ρ. A quorum of observables refers to a complete
set of noncommuting observables whose measurements on the ensemble of identical states
are used in quantum tomography to estimate the ensemble averages of all operators of a
quantum system including its density matrix ρ. Quantum tomography can be described as
an inverse statistical problem in which the unknown parameters and the data are given by
the results of measurements performed on identical quantum states.
DOI: 10.1201/9781003172192-12 267268 Quantum Tomography
Fano stated first the problem of quantum state determination through repeated mea￾surements on identically prepared systems. He recognized the need for more than two non￾commuting observables to achieve that purpose. But we can say that the proposal by Vogel
and Risken [2] led to the birth of quantum tomography.
Wolfgang Ernst Pauli problem [3] asks the question whether measurements of probability
densities of position and momentum of a particle determine its quantum state wave function
ψ. But it has been proved that the knowledge of position and momentum distributions alone
does not single out one specific state. One can easily determine the expectation values of
operators in a given pure or mixed state of a quantum state. But the inverse problem of
determining the quantum state of an ensemble of identically prepared individual system
by performing measurements is a nontrivial task. We need a generator which generates
particles in the same state any number of times to create an ensemble of the same state
ψ. For example, we may have a laser generating photons in a given state. As a complete
set of observables (quorum) was needed for a complete determination of the density matrix
and as it was difficult to device concretely measurables apart from position, momentum
and energy the problem of determining the quantum state remained as mere speculation
for many years. Experimentally determining the quantum state was realized only through
the pioneering experiments by Raymer’s group [4] in the domain of quantum optics.
This chapter provides the relevant theory and techniques of quantum tomography. To
start with, first a counter example for negative answer to the Pauli problem and the reason
for it are given. Quantum tomography set out the density matrix of quantum states. The
determination of density matrix from Wigner function is considered. Then the optical ho￾modyne tomography technique of reconstruction of Wigner function is outlined. Next, the
single and multiqubits tomography are discussed. Details of quantum states can be explored
through quantum process tomography. A few of such methods are presented.
12.2 Pauli Problem
We associate wave functions or vectors in a Hilbert space for pure quantum states and
density matrices represent mixed quantum states. These wave functions give probability
distributions of position and momentum using which one can find the expectation values
of observables. Pauli [3] posed the inverse problem whether it was possible to reconstruct
uniquely the quantum state from the knowledge of the probability distributions of position
and momentum. It was found that the answer to Pauli’s problem is negative.
12.2.1 Answer to the Pauli Problem
The negative answer to the original Pauli problem may be given by counter examples as
shown in Hans Reichenbach’s book [5]. For example, consider the two squeezed states [6,7]
in the position representation (~ = 1) given by
ψ1(q) = Ne
−αq2+iβq, ψ2(q) = Ne
−α
∗
q
2+iβq (12.2)
with Re α ≥ 0 and β real. Normalization of the two ψ’s gives N = ((α + α
∗
)/π)
1/4
(see
the exercise 2 at the end of this chapter). Finding the momentum wave functions for the
coordinate wave functions given by Eq. (12.2), we obtain (see the exercise 3 at the end ofPauli Problem 269
this chapter)

. (12.3)
From Eqs. (12.2) and (12.3) we find, respectively, the probability densities in coordinate
and momentum representations as
|ψ1(q)|
2 = |ψ2(q)|
2 = |N|

)/(4αα∗
)
. (12.4b)
The two states given by Eq. (12.2) have the same probability densities in both coordinate
and momentum representations given, respectively, by Eqs. (12.4a) and (12.4b). If ψ1(q)
and ψ2(q) are same then the fidelity F = |hψ1|ψ2i|2 must be one. The fidelity F for the ψ1
and ψ2 given by Eq. (12.2) is found to be (see the exercise 4 at the end of this chapter)
F =
α + α
∗
2
√
αα∗
. (12.5)
Since F 6= 1 we conclude that the two states are different even though they have same
probability densities in coordinate and momentum representations. It establishes that the
answer to Pauli’s problem is negative. Coordinate and momentum probability densities
don’t determine uniquely a quantum state.
12.2.2 Reason For Negative Answer To Pauli Problem
To find the reason why the knowledge of the two marginal probability distributions of
position and momentum is not sufficient to determine an unique quantum state, we follow
the procedure given by Ibort et al. [7].
Consider the family of dimensionless observables depending on two real parameters µ
and ν as
X(µ, ν) = µQ + νP. (12.6)
Q and P generate Weyl-Heisenberg algebra [Q, P] = i~I if Planck constant ~ is restored.
The spectrum X(µ, ν) is the real line parametrized by X for the corresponding improper
eigenvectors |Xµνi. In the position representation
X(µ, ν) = −i~ν
d
dq
+ µq. (12.7)
The improper eigenfuctions for the operator given in Eq. (12.7) are found to be (see the
exercise 5 at the end of this chapter)

(q) = hq|Xµνi =
1

e
−iµq2/(2~ν)+iXq/(hν)
. (12.8)
The operator in Eq. (12.6) can be given in momentum representation as
X(µ, ν) = νp − i~µ
d
dp
. (12.9)
Similar to the eigenfunctions given by Eq. (12.8) the eigenfuctions in momentum represen￾tation can be found as

. (12.10)270 Quantum Tomography
For the case of the operators X(µ, ν) the symplectic tomogram of a normalized pure
state ψ is defined as

Physically Tψ(X, µ, ν)dX represents the marginal probability of a measure between X
and X + dX in the given state |ψi of the observable X(µ, ν) with fixed µ and ν. If ψ is
normalized then the total marginal probability is
Z
Tψ(X, µ, ν)dX = 1. (12.13)
The density matrix ρ(q, q0

From Eq. (12.11) we find that Tψ(X, 1, 0) gives the marginal probability distribution of
position and Tψ(X, 0, 1) gives the marginal probability distribution of momentum. We find
from Eq. (12.14), the density matrix cannot be found using just Tψ(X, 1, 0) and Tψ(X, 0, 1).
So, the answer to the Pauli problem is negative. This is due to the fact that the reconstruc￾tion of density matrix needs details of several different marginal probability distributions
with respect to several different observables of the family X(µ, ν). A minimal set of such
observables is termed as a quorum.
12.3 Recovery of Density Matrix from Wigner Function
Quantum state tomography, for short, quantum tomography can be defined as a method for
estimating the ensemble averages of all operators of a quantum system including its density
matrix. This estimation is done from a set of measurements of a complete set of noncom￾muting observables (quorum). So, the tomographic probability representation is equivalent
to the conventional Schr¨odinger, Heisenberg and Feynman path integral representations of
quantum mechanics. Ideally speaking, the quantum state is perfectly recovered through
quantum tomography only in the limit of infinite number of measurements. But practically
only finite number of measurements can be done resulting in an appropriate state with aRecovery of Density Matrix from Wigner Function 271
statistical error. Also, increase in the dimension of the Hilbert space requires enormous mea￾surements resulting in high statistical errors which make it almost impossible to estimate
the density matrix of the quantum state.
In classical tomography a picture of a hidden object is buidup using various observations
from different angles. The foundation of tomography rests on the problem formulated and
solved by Johannes Radon [9]. Suppose we have a function f(x, y) satisfying some regularity
conditions. If we integrate f(x, y) along all possible lines in the x − y plane and get F(l),
where l denotes a line. Radon found the solution to reconstruct the initial function f(x, y)
out of F(l). The tomographic reconstruction techniques used in medical imaging follow this
Radon mathematical techniques. If x and y are taken as phase space variables then the
function f can be thought as the Wigner function (refer chapter 6). Then the function
on lines F becomes the measured probability distribution. The Radon transformation of
the probability distribution gives the Wigner function. The density matrix can be then
recovered from the Wigner functions.
We have discussed the original Wigner function introduced by Wigner [10] in chapter 6.
Quantum tomography aims to reconstruct the density matrix of quantum states. Wigner
function is found to play the role of a quasi-probability distribution (QPD) as it can also
have negative values. It can be used to find quantum mechanical expectation values in the
form of averages over phase space complex plane.
Field operators are given in terms of ordered products of annihilation and creation
operators. We have the annihilation operator a and creation operator a
†
. Conventionally, the
product (a
†
)
na
m is called normally ordered (a appears right of a
†
) and the product a
m(a
†
)
n
is called anti-normally ordered (a appears left of a
†
). If the products appear symmetrically
in the expansion we say that it is symmetrically ordered.
We follow the general theory of quantum tomography given by Chen et al [11] and

the expectations of symmetrically ordered product of the field operators using the original

12.4 Optical Homodyne Tomography
We have seen in the previous section that there is a one to one correspondance between the
Wigner function and the density matrix of a quantum state. So, quantum state reconstruc￾tion (QSR) can be done by reconstruction of QPDs.
The concept of tomography was introduced by Bertrand and Bertrand [13]. They pointed
out a way to reconstruct Wigner functions from marginals. The pioneering paper of Vosel
and Risken [2] inspired many works of QSR in quantum optics. They discussed a method to
reconstruct QSR from the measured quadrature amplitude distribution of optical homodyne
measurements. The first experiments of QSR were reported in the refs. [4,16,17] by Smithey
et al. In their experiments they used the balanced homodyne detection in which a pulsed
signal field was superposed in a 50 : 50 beam spliter with a local pulsed coherent state field.
They determined Wigner functions of a vacuum and a quadrature squeezed state. This new
technique was called Optical Homodyne Tomography (OHT). Later OHT was performed
for a continuous wave light field [18,19]. So, in OHT, the probability distributions of the
quadrature amplitudes are measured. Next, the Wigner distribution is obtained by tomo￾graphic inversion of the set of measured probability distributions. Then density operator ρ
is obtained from the Wigner function. ρ will give the expectation value of any observable
O as hOi = Tr(ρO).
The probability distributions of the quadrature amplitudes Xφ given by Eq. (12.19) can
be measured for different phase φ using a balanced homodyne detector . The schematic of
homodyne detector is shown in Fig. 12.1 [11]. The signal and a local oscillator (LO) wave
are mixed at a 50 : 50 beam splitter (BS). The LO is excited by a laser in a coherent state
|zi. By controlling the path length of the LO beams the relative phase φ between signal and
LO wave can be varied. Xφ at various paths can be measured by tuning φ. PD1 and PD2
are high efficient matched photo detectors measuring the two output beams from BS. a, b,
c and d are the annihilation operators of the corresponding four ports. Since the number
operators are c
†
c and d
†d the difference current measured by the spectrum analyser (SA)
is given by
I− = I1 − I2 = η(d

where η = 2|z| is the rescaling factor. For a 50 : 50 beam splitter
c =

√
2
(a − b), d =

√
2
(a + b). (12.26)
From Eqs. (12.25) and (12.26) we get
I− = η(b
†
a + a
†
b). (12.27)
In homodyne detection the LO wave is made very large so that it can be treated as a
classical wave. So, b can be replaced by a complex number b = Ae
iφ
. Substituting this in
Eq. (12.27) we find
I− = ηA(ae
−iφ + a
†
e
iφ
) = 2ηAXφ, Xφ =
1
2
(ae
−iφ + a
†
e
iφ
). (12.28)
Hence, Eq. (12.28) proves that measurement of the difference current I− is equivalent to
measurement of quadrature amplitude Xφ. By changing φ we can measure any quadrature
we want.
If one wants to preserve the complete information and to extract the density matrix
or the Wigner function of any arbitrary state of the signal then it is essential to measure
all the quadrature amplitude distributions w(X, φ). Here X is the quadrature amplitude
value. Vogel and Risken [2] pointed out that the s-parametrized Wigner function can be
reconstructed from the measure marginals w(X, φ) as

/8 + iη(X − αr cos φ − αi sin φ)]
×|η|dXdηdφ. (12.29)
Here η is an integrating factor, αr and αi are the real and imaginary parts of α.
The first experiment and reconstruction of the Wigner functions of a vacuum state and
a quadrature squeezed state are reported in [16,17]. As Eq. (12.29) is similar to the classical
tomographic inversion from the projections of two-dimensional objects it is called an inverse
Radon transform. Hence, this method is called as optical homodyne tomography.
12.5 Qubit Quantum Tomography
We need to understand the representation of quantum states before analysing them. Gener￾ally, specific parametrization of states simplifies the reconstruction of unknown states. We
discuss this in this section [20].
12.5.1 Density Matrix in Qubit Representation
We can represent any single qubit as
|ψi = α|0i + β|1i, (12.30)
where α and β are complex constants. If |ψi is normalized then |α|
2 + |β|
2 = 1. As we have
already discussed, quantum tomography requires an ensemble of such pure states. We canQubit Quantum Tomography 275
represent a mixed pure state by a density matrix ρ as
ρ =
X

h0| h1|
=
|0i
|1i

A Ce
iφ

−iφ B

, (12.31)
where pi
X
is the probabilistic weighting factor for the state |ψii in the mixed state. Thus,
i
pi = 1. A, B and C are real constants. For the ensemble of pure states Tr(ρ) = A+B = 1
and C ≤
√
AB .
As ρ is Hermitian it can be diagonalized with eigenvalues {E1, E2} corresponding to
mutually orthogonal eigenvectors 
|ψi, |ψ
⊥i
	
. So, in this orthonormal eigenvector basis ρ
is diagonlized. That is,
hψ| hψ

ρ =


E1 0

⊥ihψ
⊥|. (12.32)
For a polarized single photon we can take the two orthogonal states as the horizontal
|Hi = |0i and vertical |V i = |1i polarized states. The other pure polarization states diag￾onal |Di, antidiagonal |Ai, right-circular |Ri and left-circular |Li polarization sates can be
constructed from coherent superposition of |Hi and |V i states as
|Di =
1
√

(|Hi + |V i), |Ai =

|Ri =

√
2
(|Hi + i|V i), |Li =

√
2
(|Hi − i|V i). (12.33b)
Suppose we have a photon source which emits in each second a single photon wave
packet. However, they are altered between vertical, horizontaland diagonal polarizations.
Assume that the timing information is ignored when the polarization is measured. In this
case the state density matrix can be given by
ρ =

(|HihH| + |V ihV | + |DihD|). (12.34)

Diagonalizing the matrix ρ given above we get the eigenvalues as 2/3 and 1/3 (see the
exercise 10 at the end of present chapter) corresponding to the orthogonal eigenvectors |Di
and |Ai. So, ρ can be written in the |Di and |Ai basis as

12.5.2 Stokes Parameters and Density Matrix
Polarized light wave is described by the commonly used Stokes parameters introduced by
George Gabriel Stokes in 1852. The same parameters can be used for qubits. Any single
qubit density matrix ρ can be given uniquely as
ρ =
1

. (12.38b)
Due to normalization S0 = 1. For pure and mixed states X

S

i become 0 and < 1,
respectively. The outcome of a specific pair of projective measurements will give the Stokes
parameters as

(|0i+i|1i) − P
√1
2
(|0i−i|1i)
, S3 = P|0i − P|1i
. (12.39b)
In Eqs. (12.39) P|φi gives the probability to measure |φi. For the single qubit state
P|ψi + P|ψ⊥i = 1, P|ψi − P|ψ⊥i = 2P|ψi − 1. (12.40)
If we define
|φi1 =
1
√
2
(|0i + |1i), |φi2 =
1
√
2
(|0i + i|1i), |φi3 = |0i (12.41)
then their orthogonal vectors are given by
|φ
⊥i1 =
1
√
2
(|0i − |1i), |φ
⊥i2 =
1
√
2
(|0i − i|1i), |φ
⊥i3 = |1i. (12.42)
Using Eqs. (12.40) we find from Eqs. (12.39) and Eqs. (12.41) the projective measurement
of the three states given by Eq. (12.41) will give the three Stokes parameters S1, S2 and
S3. As S0 = 1 these four Stokes parameters can be used to find the density matrix ρ using
Eq. (12.37).
For the photon case
|Hi = |0i, (12.43a)
|Di =
1
√
2
(|Hi + |V i) = 1
√
2
(|0i + |1i), (12.43b)
|Ri =
1
√
2
(|Hi + i|V i) = 1
√
2
(|0i + i|1i). (12.43c)
Comparing Eqs. (12.41) and (12.43) we find that S1 corresponds to the measurement of
diagonal, S2 corresponds to the measurement of right-circular and S3 corresponds to the
measurement of horizontal polarizations of the photon. We have seen the representation ofExperimental Measure of Polarization of a Photonic Qubit 277

polarization states in Poincar´e sphere (Bloch sphere) in sec. 5.9. The three Stokes param￾eters represent the given state |ψi as a point in the sphere as shown in Fig. 12.2. So, the
projective measurements of the three states |Di, |Ri and |Hi of the photon state leads to
the determination of the density matrix of the state of input photon.

12.6 Experimental Measure of Polarization of a
Photonic Qubit
The experimental set-up [21] to analyse the polarization of a photonic qubit is shown in
Fig. 12.3. The source beam passes through a quarter-wave plate (QWP), a half-wave plate
(HWP) and the polarizing beam spliter (PBS). The PBS transmits the horizontally polar￾ized light and reflects the vertically polarized light. The two output beams from PBS are278 Quantum Tomography

fed into two separate avalanche photo diodes (APD). We have seen in the previous section
that measurements of polarization along the three mutually perpendicular directions will
give the three Stokes parameters S1, S2 and S3. Measurements of S1, S2 and S3 will give
the density matrix of the input state of the source. Projective measurement on different
direction can be done by different rotations of HWP and QWP.
The state vector is rotated by 180◦ around an axis by the HWP which is 2α times
rotation of the crystal in the plane perpendicular to the incident light. If 0◦ position is
defined as the direction in which horizontal polarized light stays horizontal (z-direction in
Bloch sphere) then for an α-degree rotation the operator of the HWP is given by
HWP(α) = 
cos 2α sin 2α
sin 2α − cos 2α

= sin 2ασ1 + cos 2ασ3. (12.45)
The operator for the QWP which rotates the state vector by 45◦ around an axis as in the
case of HWP is given by
QWP(α) = 
cos2 α − i sin2 α (1 + i) sin α cos α
(1 + i) sin α cos α −i cos2 α + sin2 α
!
=
1
2
[(1 − i)(1 + sin 2ασ1) + (1 + i) cos 2ασ3] . (12.46)
As S1, S2 and S3 can be found from the projective measurements on the three standard
directions x, y and z (refer Fig. 12.2) the angles for the three directions are given in table
12.1.
Single photons are recorded as clicks in the APD in either the horizontal or vertical
channels. Recorded number of events can be transformed to represent the probability P|ψi
by normalizing with the total number of events during the measurements as
P|ψi ≈
N(|ψi)
Ntotal
. (12.47)Multiqubit Tomography 279
Only for Ntotal → ∞ the equality will hold good. Having measured these values for the three
directions of polarizations the parameters S1, S2 and S3 can be estimated. Then Eq. (12.37)
can be used to find the density matrix ρ. Instead of the three orthogonal axes represented
by the Pauli matrices another independent three directions (not necessarily orthogonal)
can also be chosen. From those measurements also the three Stokes parameters can be
estimated.
12.7 Multiqubit Tomography
The idea used for the single qubit tomography can be extended to multiqubit tomography
also. Let us outline it in this section [21].
The density of state for N-qubit state is given by [21–23]
ρ =
1
2N
X
3
i1,i2,...,iN =0
Ti1,i2,...,iN σi1 ⊗ σi2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ σiN , (12.48)
where the bases are coded as i = 0 ⇒ σ0 = 1, σ1 = σx, σ2 = σy and σ3 = σz. The tensor,
T, components are the measured values of the polarizations in certain bases combinations.
The tensor products of the Pauli’s matrices give the choice of basis. As for the case of single
qubit the measurements are done on the three orthogonal directions (x, y, z). For example,
in a two-qubit the term σx ⊗ σy = (σx ⊗ 1)(1 ⊗ σy) corresponds to a measurement along
the x-axis on qubit 1 and y-axis on qubit 2. This measurement will give the matrix element
TXY , where the measurement directions are coded in the order and label of the subindex.
Then the Stokes parameters are normalized for the single qubit case taking S0 = 1. For the
N-qubit the normalization is done by taking T11...1 = 1. So, the remaining 2N × 2
N − 1
tensor components have to be determined by polarization measurements.
If we use PBSs for measurements then it will give an overestimate of measurements. For
example, for two-qubit the tensor components TZY and T1Y can be estimated using same
measurements. We write
TZY = TZ ⊗ TY
= S3 ⊗ S2
=
￾
P|Hi − P|V i

⊗
￾
P|Ri − P|Li

= P|HRi − P|HLi − P|V Ri + P|V Li (12.49)
and T1Y = T1 ⊗ TY = S0 ⊗ S2 becomes
T1Y =
￾
P|Hi + P|V i

⊗
￾
P|Ri − P|Li

= P|HRi − P|HLi + P|V Ri − P|V Li
. (12.50)
Here P|HRi refers to the probability to measure the state |Hi in qubit 1 and |Ri in qubit
2. We find from Eqs. (12.49) and (12.50), same four probability values will give two tensor
components T1Y and TZY . So, in a measurement set-up using PBSs only 3N − 1 unique
settings are needed for measurements of the complete T tensor if the correlations in the
outputs of the PBS are recorded. Figure 12.4 gives the schematic experimental set-up for a
two-qubit quantum tomography [21].
A two-photon state is detected only when a photon is detected in arm-1 and arm-2
simultaneously. As multiqubit entangled states produced by most sources have low c280 Quantum Tomography

12.8 Quantum Process Tomography
Characterization of quantum dynamical systems is very important for quantum control
and quantum information processing. The state of the system can be determined using
quantum state tomography. It is equally important to identify an unknown quantum process
acting on a quantum system. Any open quantum system suffers due to the noisy process
known as decoherence. The characterization of such systems is a key issue in quantum
information science. Quantum process tomography (QPT) aims to give full information on
the dynamics of a quantum state. QPT can be used to improve the design and control of
quantum hardware. For example, the characterization of single- and two-qubit controlled
NOT gates are very important as they are the building blocks of a quantum computers. As
QPT can give information about the noise sources affecting quantum information processor
it can help in designing good error correcting strategies.
QPT methods can be classified as direct methods or indirect methods. Direct methods
need the use of quantum state tomography. In indirect methods first the information about
the quantum process of a system is mapped onto the state of some probe quantum sys￾tems. Secondly, the process is reconstructed using quatum state tomography on the output
states. Indirect methods need application of an inversion on the final output data. Stan￾dard quantum process tomography (SQPT) [24–27] and ancilla-assisted process tomography
(AAPT) [28–31] belong to indirect methods. In direct methods, experimental outcome will
give directly information about the process without the need for quantum state tomography
[27,32–36]. An extensive review of all these methods was presented in [27]. In this reviewQuantum Process Tomography 281
the required physical resources that arise in preparation and quantum measurements are
analyzed and the complexity analysis of different QPT schemes is also presented.
12.8.1 Quantum Dynamical Maps
Let us briefly introduce the concept of quantum dynamical maps [27]. The dynamics (evo￾lution) of an open quantum system can be described by a completely-positive linear map
as
E(ρ) = X
i
AiρA†
i
. (12.51)
This provides the transformation from an input state ρin to an output state ρout. The output
ρout is given by the Kraus operator-sum representation [37]. We can write ρout = E(ρin) =
P
i AiρinA
†
i
. The physical process acting on the quantum system ρ is described by the
channel (quantum operation) E. E maps ρin to ρout. {Ai} is a set of mappings (called Kraus
operators) from the input Hilbert space to the output Hilbert space with P
i AiA
†
i ≤ I
which gaurantees that TrE(ρ) ≤ 1 [37]. Instead Ai we can choose a set of fixed Hermitian
basis operators {Ei}
d−1
i=0 which satisfy the orthogonality condition Tr 
E
†
i Ej

= dδij . For
example, for multiqubit systems Ei
’s can be tensor products of identity and Pauli matrices.
If Ai are decomposed as Ai =
P
m aimEm then Eq. (12.51) becomes
E(ρ) =
d
X2−1
m=0, n=0
χmnEmρE†
n
, (12.52)
where the matrix χ =
P
i,j amia
∗
nj includes all information about the map E with respect
to the {Ei} basis. Measurements of the observables Ei will lead to determination of the d
4
independent matrix elements of χ.
12.8.2 Standard Quantum Process Tomography
In SQPT d
2
linearly independent inputs {ρk}
d
2−1
k=0 are prepared and the output states E(ρk)
are measured using quantum state tomography [27]. If {|mi}d−1
m=0 is an orthonormal basis
of Hilbert space H then {ρ(k)}
d
2−1
k=0 can be chosen as the linearly independent basis set of
operators, where ρk = |mihn|. The output state of the channel E acting on one of these
inputs E(|mihn|) can be found by preparing the input states
|mi, |ni, |+i =
1
√
2
(|mi + |ni), |−i =
1
√
2
(|mi + i|ni)
and then forming the linear combination of the outputs E(|mihm|), E(|nihn|), E(|+ih+|)
and E(|−ih−|). We write
E(|mihn|) = E(|+ih+|) + iE(|−ih−|)
−
(1 + i)
2
[E(|mihm|) + E(|nihn|)] . (12.53)
So, measurements of E(|+ih+|), E(|−ih−|), E(|mihm|) and E(|nihn|) will be sufficient to
determine E(|mihn|).
As every E(ρk) can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis state we get
E(ρk) = P
l
λklρl
. Since λkl are expectation values obtained by measurements of the fixed
basis operator Ek, we obtain λkl = Tr [EkE(ρl)]. If we combine this relation with the282 Quantum Tomography
relation EnρkE†
n =
P
l Bmn,lkρl we get P
m,n Bmn,lkχmn = λkl. This equation can be given
in matrix form as Bχ = λ. The (d
4 × d
4
)-dimensional matrix B is determined from the
choice of bases {ρk} and {Em} and the d
4
-dimensional vector λ is determined from the
state tomography experiments. Inversion of Bχ = λ will give χ. In general Bχ = λ does
not give a unique χ.
An ensemble of states (ρj ) are prepared and each of them goes through the process given
by the map E and then measurements of Em are performed at the output [27]. Therefore, for
SQPT d
2
linearly independent inputs {ρj} have to be prepared. Each input ρj is subjected
to the quantum process E followed by QST on the corresponding outputs. For each ρj the
expectation values of the d
2 fixed basis operations {Ek} have to be measured in the output
state E(ρj ). So, one has to perform d
4 measurements. All these measurements have to be
done on an ensemble of identically prepared quantum systems corresponding to a given
experimental setting.
12.8.3 Ancilla-Assisted Quantum Process Tomography
In SQPT an ensemble of a number of different quantum states is prepared then each one
of them is subjected to the same quantum process to be characterized and then QST is
performed on the outputs. Ancilla-assisted quantum process tomography (AAQPT) is an
alternative technique to SQPT. In AAQPT an extra ancilla qubit is introduced. It involves
preparation and tomography of only a single two-qubit quantum state rather than four
one-qubit state.
According to Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism [38,39] a correspondence exists between
the positive quantum maps (E) and quantum state ρE as
ρE = (E ⊗ I)(|φ
+ihφ
+|), |φ
+i =
X
d
i=1
1
√
d
|ii ⊗ |ii, (12.54)
where |φ
+i is the maximally entangled state of the system and an ancilla with the same
size. Actually the one-to-one map between E and ρE has made the quantum process to be
equivalent to a quantum state in a large Hilbert space HAB of the principal system A and
the ancilla system B. That is, AAQPT reduces the problem of QPT to QST.
12.8.4 Direct Characterization of Quantum Dynamics
SQPT and AAQPT uses mapping of the dynamics onto a state. One may like to avoid
mapping and perform a direct measurement of quantum dynamics thereby avoid any state
tomography. Such direct methods are referred as direct characterization of quantum dynam￾ics [36,40] and include the estimation of general functions of a quantum state [41], detection
of quantum entanglement [33,42], reconstruction of quantum states or dynamics from in￾complete measurements [43,44], measurement of nonlinear properties of bipartite quantum
states [34], estimation of the average fidelity of a quantum gate or process [45–47], universal
source coding and data compression [48] a few to mention.
Direct characterization of quantum dynamics (DCQD) differs in many ways from SQPT
and AAQPT. AAQPT it does not require inversion of a full d
2 × d
2 matrix as in AAQPT
[36,40]. In DCQD certain entangled states are used as inputs and simple error-detecting
measurements on the joint system-ancilla Hilbert space are performed. A combination of
these input states and measurements give rise to direct encoding of the elements of the
quantum map into results. Therefore, there is no need for QST of the output states. The
measured probability distributions are directly related to the elements χ thus avoiding theConclusion 283
need for a complete inversion as in the indirect methods. So, in DCQD the χ matrix elements
of the linear quantum maps become experimentally observable directly.
12.9 Conclusion
Knowledge of state preparation, state evolution and measurements are essential in all quan￾tum technologies such as quantum computers. QST and QPT are used to characterize the
quantum state and quantum evolution. Diagnosing errors and improving designs of quan￾tum gates and architectures need a full characterization of a quantum process using QPT.
As QPT dpends on measurement outcomes which may contain errors due to noise and
imperfection of the measuring devices the resulting process may not be physical. Such non￾physicallity may be corrected using maximum likelihood estimation or through Bayesian
interference technique [49]. More information on SQPT, AAQPT and DCQD can be ob￾tained from the ref. [27].
Though QST and QPT are powerful techniques they do not take advantage of any prior
information available to the experimentalists. Bayesian estimation is a class of techniques
that allow one to include prior information related to the experiment. Bayesian tomography
is gaining importance due to many recent developments. Though QST was implemented in
optical system first, it has been demonstrated in many different experimental platforms
like atomic ions, atomic spins of neutral atoms, orbital angular momentum modes of light
and superconducting qubits. Similarly, QPT has been used in many different processes such
as entangling gates with trapped atomic ions and optical systems, the motion of atoms in
optical lattice and three qubits in NMR.
The major difficulty in using tomography is the presence of the sources of noise and de￾choherence in any experimental set-up. Due to the errors introduced by noise, the estimates
are not always accurrate. Also, as the order of the qubits increases the system becomes too
large and highly expensive. To overcome these difficulties many new technologies are being
developed.

Quantum Simulation
13.1 Introduction
The laws governing the behaviour of microscopic quantum systems are given by quantum
mechanics. Though the basic laws of low-energy physics is well known at microscopic level,
many fundamental questions remain open about the collective dynamics of the macroscopic
scale. When a system as in condensed matter physics has a large number of constituents
or degrees of freedom, it cannot be treated exactly by quantum mechanics. The collec￾tive behaviour of a macroscopic system can drastically change from that of its microscopic
constituents. For example, in phase transition of the bulk materials the elementary interac￾tion at the microscopic level remains same, eventhough dramatic changes are observed in
macroscopic level. A few such examples for these dramatic changes occurring at some criti￾cal temperatures are: magnetic phase transition at Curie temperature, superfuid transition
in helium, superconducting transition in electronic metal-insulator transition in electronic
systems. Though these phenomena appear only in very large scale macroscopic systems,
they arise mainly due to the mutual interactions of their elementary constituents. In many
situations, local two-body interactions are sufficient to explain the dramatic changes tak￾ing place at the macroscopic bulk materials. It has been found that the well established
classical laws of physics fail to explain both the microscopic behaviour of the fundamental
constituents of the bulk material and also the dynamical behaviour of macroscopic physical
systems made of several interacting fundamental constituents.
Quantum mechanics is the most complete and successful theory we have currently to
describe the dynamics of the elementary constituents of a macroscopic system. A variety
of methods and simulation tools like quantum Monte-Carlo molecular dynamics, tensor
networks have been developed in the past to solve some of the theoretical models formulated
in quantum mechanical terms and correctly describe a large variety of quantum phenomena
[1]. These methods make use of mathematical modelling in which the informations we know
about a system of interest are mapped on a certain set of variables and equations. The
resulting mathematical identities, to be solved either exactly or numerically, can be called
as a simulator .
A quantum simulator can be used to study the behaviour of the concerned real system.
The accuracy with which this simulation predicts the behaviour of the real system depends
on the validity of the initial mathematical model chosen and the available computational
power. It has been found that even the modern classical supercomputers currently available
are not able to solve most of these simulation models. So, quantum simulators have long
been proposed as a possible replacement of these classical simulation models.
In the present chapter, first we point out the limitations in simulating quantum sys￾tems in classical computers. We give a general scheme of quantum simulation. We present
the features of analog and digital quantum simulators. Then we discuss the basic theory
of quantum simulation of Schr¨odinger equation. Next, we describe the various stages of
quantum simulation using quantum computers and relevant quantum circuits.

13.2 Limitations of Classical Computers in Simulating Quantum
Systems
Simulations of many quantum models using classical computers have been done over many
decades in the past. The most successful methods are the quantum Monte Carlo algorithms.
These classical stochastic methods generally work well only when the functions being inte￾grated do not change sign so that sampling of these functions at a relatively small points
give good approximations to the integrals of these functions. But for some quantum sys￾tems like fermionic and frustrated systems sign problems arise in numerical evaluation of
integrals due to the problem of sampling of nonpositive semi-definite weight functions. This
leads to exponential growth of statistical errors in the results with increase of number of
particles. Other classical methods such as mean-field and dynamical mean-field theory, ten￾sor network theory, density functional theory, many-body perturbation theories or Green’s
function based methods have their own limitations which restrict their applicability to large
quantum systems.
In a general quantum simulation problem we are interested to find the wave function
ψ(t) at time t given its value at t = 0. Using ψ(t), we can compute the values of some
physical quantities of the system. The time evolution of ψ(t) is given by the Schr¨odinger
equation
i~
d
dt
|ψi = H|ψi. (13.1)
For time-independent Hamiltonian H the solution of the above equation is
|ψ(t)i = e−iHt/~
|ψ(0)i. (13.2)
For numerical computation of |ψ(t)i we have to discretize the problem so that it can be
encoded in the computer memory.
Unlike a classical state, a quantum state represented by a wave function |ψi is a su￾perposition of all the configuration of the system. Classically, a spin-1/2 particle can be
represented as a spin-up state 1 and a spin-down state 0. But quantum mechanically, the
spin state of the particle is a superposition state c1|0i + c2|1i, where c1 and c2 are the ex￾pansion coefficients for the two configurations |0i and |1i states. For a two particle system,
there are four configurations |00i, |01i, |10i and |11i. So the state of the system is a vector
in a 4-dimensional Hilbert space
|ψi = c1|00i + c2|01i + c3|10i + c4|11i. (13.3)
There are 22 = 4 coefficients needed to describe the quantum state. For a system of N spin￾1/2 particles the memory needed to store the state will be 2N . In a classical computer with
a memory of 1012, one can store the state of N particles, where N = log ￾
1012
/ log 2 ≈ 40.
So it is possible to do quantum simulation on a classical computer with a memory capacity
of 1012 for a quantum system with just 40 spin-1/2 particles. Moreover, to calculate the
time evolution given by Eq. (13.2) requires the exponentiation of a 240 × 2
40 matrix with
nearly 1024 entries. So it is practically impossible to use classical computers to perform
quantum simulation for systems with large number of particles.
It has been found that simulating quantum mechanical system is a very challenging
problem in classical computers due to the difficulty of storing the quantum state of a large
physical system. Quantum state is described by a number of parameters that grows ex￾ponentially with the number of particles or degrees of freedom of the system. MoreoverQuantum Simulators 289

stimulating the temporal evolution of the quantum system requires a number of opera￾tions which also increases exponentially with system size. All these limitations of classical
computer in simulating quantum systems make it quite inefficient even for small quantum
systems and not suitable to handle large systems.
13.3 Quantum Simulators
In 1982 Feynman [2] conjectured that quantum computers would be able to simulate a quan￾tum system more efficiently than classical computers as they work based on the principle
of quantum mechanics. It was felt that one can avoid the experimental scaling associated
with the simulation of increasingly large quantum systems on conventional computers using
quantum computers. After Feynman introduced the concept of quantum simulators, Seth
Lloyd [3] showed that a variety of quantum systems including quantum computers can be
programmed to simulate the behaviour of arbitrary quantum systems whose dynamics are
determined by local interactions. Lloyd proved that quantum simulation can be performed
with arbitrary precision in a computer time that grows at most polynomially proveded the
interaction is limited to only a few other neighbours.
A quantum simulator can be defined as a process in which the dynamics of a quantum
system is mapped onto the dynamics of a controllable quantum system. That is, a quantum
simulator is a controllable quantum system used to simulate or emulate other quantum
systems of interest.
A general scheme [4] for quantum simulation of a quantum system (S) is given in
Fig. 13.1. Quantum simulator aims to simulate the quantum system of interest |s(t)i from
the initial state |s(0)i using the physical system (P). The invertible map φ determines a
correspondence between all the operators and states of S and P. The propagator of the
quantum system U maps to Vt = φUφ−1 of the experimental controllable quantum sys￾tem P. To simulate the quantum system S one needs methods for controlling precisely the
dynamics of the experimental quantum system (P) so that it mimics the dynamics of the
system S. A series of operations performed by the experimenter to move the experimental
quantum system P towards the quantum system of interest S by altering the Hamiltonian
by each operation to get H as closely as possible.
Quantum simulation works by evolving the system forward locally over samll dis￾crete times slices [3]. It is possible to find local Hamiltonians H1, H2, . . ., Hn such that290 Quantum Simulation

In this equation E(k) are bounded by ||E(k)|| ≤ n||Ht/n||k

possible by taking n sufficiently large. So it is quite possible to simulate to any desired
accuracy  by taking sufficiently large n.
It has been proved that for any local Hamiltonian Hi acting on a local Hilbert space of
only mi dimensions, the number of operations needed to simulate e−iHit/n is found to be
nearly equal to m2
i
only [3]. So, the evolution of e−iHt given by Eq. (13.5) needs only a total
operations of nearly equal to n
Pl
i=1 m2
i
. If m is the maximum of mi then the number of op￾erations to simulate e−iHt will be ≤ nlm2
. Therefore, as long as l is a polynomial functions
of N (the number of variables of the system) the number of computations increases only
polynomially. Hence, decomposing the total Hamiltonian H into a series of local Hamiltoni￾ans Hi as given by Eq. (13.5) makes the number of computation to increase as polynomials
instead of exponential growth with the increase of the system size. In a quantum simulator
we are able to break our original problem of evaluating e−iHt into smaller pieces e−iHit/n
which can be implemented with limited number of operations on the experimental system
or with a limited number of quantum gates in a quantum computer. The maximum number
of operations for a given error  increases only polynomially with the increase of system size
as long as the Hamiltonians Hi are having only nearest neighbour interactions.
We can use quantum simulators to solve scientific problems that are not solvable by
other methods. Quantum simulation will be considered successful only if the initial state
preparation, the implementation of the time evolution and the measurements of observables
are realized using only polynomial resources. The measurements from the simulators are
more important as they only give useful informations about the quantum system. Generally,
all these procedures to be used in a quantum simulators are not easy tasks. Quantum
simulators are classified into two types: (i) analog quantum simulators [5–14] and (ii) digital
quantum simulators [3,12,15–24]. We present these in the next two sections.
13.4 Analog Quantum Simulators
In an analog quantum simulator the physical properties of a targeted model are reproduced
on a physical set-up under externally controlled conditions. The evolution of the quantum
system is simulated onto the controlled evolution of the quantum simulator. One quantum
system will mimic the evolution of another quantum system. In analog quantum simulator
the Hamiltonian Hsys is mapped on the Hamiltonian Hsim of the simulator. So the qunatuDigital Quantum Simulators 291
system to be simulated and the controllable simulator system must be fairly similar. Con￾sequently, any analog quantum simulator can only be used for a limited class of quantum
systems.
Designing an analog quantum simulator for a specific problem is relatively simple. For
example, the study of many-body problems in condensed matter physics could be achieved
using analog quantum system consisting of an arrays of qubits realized with atoms in optical
lattices, atoms in arrays of cavities, arrays of trapped ions, superconducting circuits and
quantum dots. The controls of the quantum simulators are done using laser pulses, radio
frequency pulses and electric and magnetic fields.
Now, we give an example of mapping between a quantum system and the corresponding
simulator [11,12]. For a spin-1/2 relativistic particle in (1+ 1) dimension the Dirac equation
is
i~
∂ψ
∂t = Hsysψ =
￾
cpxσx + mc2σz

ψ. (13.6)
The HI of a single ion interacting with a bichromatic light field with η as Lamb–Dicke
parameter, ∆ as the spatial size of the ground state wave function and Ω as the parameter
controllable by the intensity of the bichromatic light field is given by
Hsim = 2η∆Ωσxpx + ~Ωσz. (13.7)
Comparing Eq. (13.6) with Eq. (13.7) we find them similar if c = 2η∆Ω and mc2 = ~Ω.
Analog quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Dirac equation using a simple trapped
ion was performed [22]. In the simulation, the position of the particle was measured as a
function of time and Zitterbewegung was studied for different initial superposition of posi￾tive and energy spinor states. Further, the cross-section from relativistic to nonrelativistic
dynamics was also analyzed. Interestingly, control of the trapped ion experimental param￾eters of the simulator was successfully realized in the simulation study. A more detailed
discussion on the Hamiltonians of several quantum simulators and those of the systems to
be simulated has been presented in ref. [12].
Experimental platforms based on neutral atoms, trapped ions, photons and supercon￾ducting circuits have been used to perform analog quantum simulations of different types.
In [13] many experimental analog simulations done using small quantum structures like a
single ion to simulate the Dirac quation, a system of two and three trapped ions to simulate
two and three quantum spins, respectively, have been presented. Ion trap techniques were
used to simulate nonequilibrium dynamics of quasiparticles. Superconducting flux qubit
interaction with the electromagnetic field is found to be analogous to that of a dipole atom￾field interaction. This interaction was used to simulate a variety of quantum optical effects.
Superconducting quantum circuits are used to simulate a number of fundamental effects
like Casimir effect, Unruh effect and Dicke superradiance. Larger structures are needed to
simulate many-body physics. Optical lattices are used for many analog simulations like Zak
phase.
13.5 Digital Quantum Simulators
Unlike in analog quantum simulators, in digital quantum simulators the time evolution
of |ψ(t)i from the initial state |ψ(0)i for a system with Hamiltonian H by the unitary
transofrmation U = e−iHt (~ = 1) is constructed by quantum circuits with quantum gates.
Qubits are used to encode state of the quantum system, the unitary transformation 292 Quantum Simulation
is translated in terms of elementary quantum gates and then they are implemented in a
circuit-based quantum computer. Computing the time evolution operator U(t) is equivalent
to the task of implementing a unitary matrix and any unitary transformation can be done
in a quantum computer using a universal set of quantum gates [19].
As discussed in sec. 13.3 the quantum computer can calculate U(t) effectively with
polynomial time and memory resources if H =
P
l Hl
, where Hl are all having only local
interactions like nearest neighbours or second-to-nearest neighbours interactions in a lattice.
From Eq. (13.4) we can write the total Hamiltonian as
U(t) = Y
l
Ul(t), Ul(t) = e−iHlt
. (13.8)
U(t) can be implemented on a universal computer by decomposing the circuit implementa￾tion of the single Ul(t) unitaries. Use of the Suzuki–Trotter (ST) decomposition gives
U(t) = exp

=
 Y
l
e
−iHlt/n!n
+ O

t
2
n

. (13.9)
So, U(t) can be approximated by repeating n times the sequence of gates corresponding
to the product of local times Ul(t) for time slices t/n. It is thus possible for systems with
H =
P
l Hl to break the problem into smaller pieces of e−iHlt/n. Each of the unitary
transformation e−iHlt/n can now be implemented using only a limited set of elementary
quantum gates. The last term in Eq. (13.9) gives the error which can be minimized to a
desired value by increasing n.
Solved Problem 1:
Show that the error term O(t
2/n) vanishes in ST decomposition if all the operators commute
among themselves.

13.6 Theory of Quantum Simulation of the Schrodinger Equation ¨
We give the outline of the theory of quantum simulation of one-dimensional Schr¨odinger
equation [25,26] in this section.
A quantum register of size n stores a collection of n qubits and the wave function is a
vector in 2n-dimensional complex Hilbert space with 2n basis functions |ki = |kn−1i. . . |k0i,
where |kj i, gives the state of the qubit. k0, . . . , kn−1 will give the binary bits {1, 0}. In a
n-bit quantum computer the wave function can be written as a linear combination of the
basis functions as
|ψi =
nX−1
k=0
Ck|ki,
nX−1
k=0
|Ck|
2 = 1. (13.15)
The one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation is

. (13.16)
To solve Eq. (13.16) we discretize the continuous variables x and t. If the motion takes place
between −d and d then −d ≤ x ≤ d. We can devide this region into 2n intervals of length
∆x = 2d/2
n and represent these intervals in n-qubit quantum register. Then we can write
the wave function (13.15) approximately as

The normalising factor is N =
qP2n−1
k=0 |ψ(xk, t)|
2. If ∆x is small then Eq. (13.17) will give
good approximation. Equation (13.16) can be integrated over a time step δt as
ψ(x, t + δt) = e−i(H0+V (x))δt/~ψ(x, t). (13.18)
The unitary transformation U = e−i(Ho+V (x))δt/~ gives the evolution of the wave func￾tion over a time interval δt. Using ST decomposition and Fourier transform (F) the total
evolution during δt can be approximated as
U ≈ e

−1 provides the evolution of ψ
over a single time-step δt. In a quantum computer each of these unitary operations can be
implemented using universal quantum gates.294 Quantum Simulation
13.7 Quantum Simulators Using Quantum Computers
We now discuss the basics of using quantum computers as universal quantum simulators.
We essentially follow the treatment in [1].
A digital quantum computer can be used to simulate the dynamics of any quantum
system with a Hamiltonian model that can be suitably encoded on a given quantum register
and implemented using a sequence of a quantum gate opedrations. The time evolution
of a quantum system described by the Hamiltonian H is given by the unitary operation
U(t) = e−iHt (~ = 1). Its implementation in a quantum computer is equivalent to evaluate
a unitary matrix. As a quantum computer can evaluate any unitary transformation with a
set of universal quantum gates, it can be used to simulate any quantum system. Of course,
for a practical possibility of application of this simulation H must be a sum of local terms
as discussed earlier. Digital quantum simulators invlove three sequential steps:
1. initial state |ψ(0)i preparation,
2. unitary evolution U and
3. final measurement of |ψ(t)i.
13.7.1 Initial State Preparation
In order to extract useful results from a quantum simulator it is important to start with
the right initial state. These initial states will be often complex or unknown. So significant
research has taken place in providing efficient methods for preparing the initial states. There
are efficient methods to prepare an unknown ground state when a simple property defining
it is specified [27]. If an explicit description about the initial state required is given then
Grover’s search algorithm based methods are available to construct the initial state directly
[28,29]. A method for generating a antisymmetric state from an unsymmetrized many￾particle state of fermions |00 . . . 0i was developed [15]. An adiabatic evolution method [30]
has been proposed for preparing the ground state of a desired Hamiltonian H from the
ground state of another Hamiltonian H0 for which it is easy to prepare the ground state.
A state-preparation algorithm was introduced which incorporates quantum simulation [31].
Still preparing a well-defined initial state either in a pure state or a mixed state remains
one of the major challenges of quantum simulators.
13.7.2 Unitary Evolution
We have to implement the evolution of the unitary operator U = e−iHt on a universal quan￾tum computer which is qubit-based, obeying the algebra of Pauli matrices and operating
with a universal set of quantum gates as discussed in chapter 9. Then U can be implemented
in such a quantum digital device by following a few simple steps [1].
1. First, a model Hamiltonian of interest H which contains all the dynamical in￾formations necessary to describe and characterize the physical quantum system
must be defined.
2. In the second step, the target Hamiltonian H is mapped and represented by the
Hamiltonian H using the qubit Pauli algebra as H → H({σα}). This mapping is
quite straight-forward for spin-1/2 systems as they obey Pauli algebra. But it isQuantum Circuits 295
also possible to map many other physical system Hamiltonians in terms of Pauli
matrices.
3. As the third step, the Hamiltonian is found as a sum of local Hamiltonians Hl
,
H =
P
l Hl
. Then we get
U = e−iHt =
Y
l
e
−iHlt
(13.20)
if all the Hl
’s commute with each other with no error. Otherwise, U is approxi￾mated as
U ≈
 Y
l
e
−iHlt/n!n
(13.21)
with an error which decreases with increase of n.
4. As the fourth step, each local unitary operator e−iHlt or e−iHlt/n are implemented
using a sequence of quantum gates. Each of the factors in ST decomposition given
by Eq. (13.21) is sequently encoded in a quantum circuit.
13.7.3 Final Measurement
After obtaining |ψ(t)i = U|ψ(0)i, final measurement has to be performed to extract the
desired information. One cannot use quantum state tomography as it will require resources
that grow exponentially with the size of the system. So in the final measurements only
direct estimation of certain physical quantities such as correlation functions or eigenval￾ues of operators are done instead of quantum state tomography. When an observable of
interest O is mapped onto a combination of the Pauli spin matrices the expectation value
hOi = hψ(t)|O|ψ(t)i can be reconstructed using appropriate unitary operations Um and
measurements in the computational basis. As generally the eigenstates of O is different
from the computational basis Um is needed.
We discuss the quantum circuits for measurement of the dynamical correlation functions
and the spectrum of the Hermitian operators in the next section.
13.8 Quantum Circuits
All the stages of quantum simulation depend on the translation of unitary operators into
elementary quantum gates. As any unitary operation can be written in terms of universal
quantum gates, in principle, quantum simulation can be done for any system. As the unitary
operation has to be efficiently simulated with polynomial resources there are Hamiltonians
which cannot be simulated with polynomial resources. Also, finding an efficient decompo￾sition in terms of universal gates is generally a difficult problem. Moreover, any unitary
operation obtained by the decomposition into single and two-qubit gates is generally an
approximation of the desired unitary operation.
13.8.1 Spin Hamiltonians
The mathematical properties of qubits on which a quantum computer works are those of
spin-1/2 systems. So, it works obeying the algebraic properties of Pauli matrices. Hence,296 Quantum Simulation
any target Hamiltonian H must be mapped into an equivalent Hamiltonian H, of Pauli
matrices to be simulated on a qubit-based architecture. For spin-based Hamiltonians of
Heisenberg models, the target Hamiltonian will be given directly only in terms of Pauli
matrices. Effective mapping for a variety of systems with s > 1/2, fermionic and fermionic￾bosonic systems and lattice models related to gauge theories are possible. The most general
form of H for a N-qubit digital quantum simulation is given by [1]

Hamiltonian given by Eq. (13.22) contains both signle and two-spin terms. For a large
number of many body systems the Hamiltonian can be reduced into the form given by
Eq. (13.22).
13.8.2 Quantum Circuits for Evolution Operator U
On a quantum computer based on N spin-1/2 systems a register of N qubits can be used to
encode and perform the quantum simulation by identifying each qubit with a single spin-1/2
element [1]. Single qubit gate operations can be done using selected control pulses on the
single qubits. The most appropriate single qubit operator is
U(θ, φ, λ) =


cos(θ/2) −e
iλ
sin(θ/2)
e
iφ
sin(θ/2) ei(λ+φ)
cos(θ/2)


which can be obtained using single qubit quantum gates such as Hadamard gate H and the
phase gate Φ(δ) given by

U can be given in terms of these two gates as
U(θ, φ, λ) = e−iθ/2Φ(π/2 + φ)HΦ(θ)HΦ(−π/2 + λ). (13.25)
Choosing particular parameters in U(θ, φ, λ) we can implement the rotations around the
coordinate axes by means of the operation (apart from global phase factors)

where hi, ji denote nearest neighbours spin pairs. For these spin models direct implemen￾tation of these Hamiltonians are possible as they have been already expressed in terms of
spin operators.
Depending upon the platforms on which quantum computers work the decompositions of
the evolution operators U
(i,j)
α,β (t) are done using different sets of quantum gates. A universal
set S1 = {Rα(θ), CNOT} having single bit rotations and two-qubit CNOT entangling
gate are commonly used for many platforms [32–34]. For example, the unitary operation
ZZ(δ) = e−iδσz⊗σz can be realized in a quantum circuit [1]. The circuit is given in Fig. 13.2a.
As Rx(π/2)σzRx(−π/2) = −σy the quantum circuit [1] implementing e−iδσy⊗σy is as given
in Fig. 13.2b. These gate sequences can be combined to simulate the spin models mentioned
above.
There are other universal sets to implement different unitary evolutions in other plat￾forms. In S2 universal set the CNOT in S1 is replaced by a parametric XX+Y Y interaction
[35–38]
Uxy(δ) = e−iδ(σx⊗σx+σy⊗σy)

13.9 Quantum Circuits for Final Measurements
The unitary evolution U gives the wave function |ψ(t)i. One must perform final measure￾ments on |ψ(t)i to extract the desired information about the simulated quantum system.
As discussed earlier correlation functions and eigenvalues are extracted. If U and V are
unitary operators then hU
†V i refers to the correlation of these two quantities. Figure 13.3a
gives the quantum circuit for the measurement of the quantity hU
†V i. One ancilla qubit a
is initially in the state |+i = (|0i + |1i)/
√
2. This can be done by applying the Hadamard
gate to the state |0i. Next, two controlled unitary evolutions are done using C − V and
C − U gates. The first operation on C − V evolves the system to Ve if the ancilla a is in the
state |1i. So we get Ve = |0ih0| ⊗ I + |1ih1| ⊗ V . The second operation evolves the system to
Ue if the ancilla is in the state |0i giving Ue = |0ih0| ⊗ U + |1ih1| ⊗ I. Then the measurement
of the expectation value of 2σ

13.10 Concluding Remarks
The problem of simulating quantum dynamics will be the most natural application of quan￾tum computers. As long as the initial state preparation, the implementation of the time
evolution and final measurement are realized with polynomial resources the quantum simu￾lators can solve many difficult problems. We have discussed analog quantum simulators with
many examples. If a similar controllable quantum system can be found for mapping the real
quantum system to it, then one can do analog quantum simulation. Compared to the digital
quantum device an analog quantum simulation is relatively easy. Finding a mapping in an
analog quantum simulator is sometimes simpler than obtaining the most efficient quantum
decomposition for a given Hamiltonian in digital quantum simulators. Also, unlike in digital
quantum simulator physical quantities can be measured directly in analog quantum sim￾ulators. Analog quantum simulation can be implemented on a quantum system even if it
is not a potential quantum computer. Consequently, analog quantum simulators are imple￾mented experimentally even though developing universal quantum computers is only at an
early stage. A number of platforms used for quantum simulations and their applications in
various fields are discussed more elaborately in the review [12].
In digital quantum simulations the general purpose quantum computers can be pro￾grammed to solve the exact time evolution of an arbitrary Hamiltonian model. For a physical
model which can be mapped onto an effective local Hamiltonian obeying the algebra of Pauli
matrices digital quantum simulator can be implemented in a qubit-based quantum computer
through a quantum circuit model. The final measurements on such a quantum simulating
circuits will give a number of observables such as spectra and correlation functions. The
ref. [1] has elaborately discussed the theory of using quantum computers as universal quan￾tum simulators. They have also discussed in detail the decomposition of evolution operators
in terms of elementary quantum gates and simulate them in quantum circuits. It has also
reviewed recent experimental results on two leading quantum technologies, namely, trapped
ions and superconducting quantum circuits.
Quantum simulation of the Klein paradox with trapped ions [39], systems in chemistry
[40,41], many-body system [42], quantum simulations with ultracold quantum gases [43]
and Rydberg atoms [44], photonic technology for quantum simulations [45], NMR as quan￾tum simulators [46–48], certifying the correct functioning of quantum simulators [49] and
dynamical structure factors of quantum simulators [50] have been analyzed.

Quantum Error Correction
14.1 Introduction
Quantum computers hold the promise to be advantageous to the classical computers for
certain class of problems like factorization of prime numbers and in search algorithms. But
quantum states are highly fragile. The advantages of quantum computers will disappear if
noise, losses and decoherence are not kept below a certain threshold. In any information
processor errors will occur. Error-correcting codes to rectify unknown errors in qubits are
an important ingredient for large scale quantum information processing. Without error cor￾rection the presence of noise during both storage and entangling operations will diminish
the gain of quantum information processing. Realization of long distance quantum cryp￾tography requires quantum error correction (QEC) of the errors introduced by noise on
communication channels.
A variety of physical systems are being explored for use as qubits. For quantum infor￾mation processing qubits using photons, trapped ions, superconducting circuits and spins in
semiconductors have been considered. But none of these platforms used for computation or
quantum signal processing can be sufficiently isolated from environment. So, errors during
quantum computation due to these external noise are inevitable.
Once Shor’s algorithm [1] demonstrated that the utilization of a quantum computer
could lead to algorithms far more efficient than used in classical computers, the next question
raised was whether a large scale controllable quantum system could be practically built.
Many believed that as the quantum states were extremely fragile, it was quite unrealistic to
maintain large and multi-qubit coherent quantum states for a long enough time to complete
any quantum algorithm. Only the development of QEC protocols convinced the general
community that quantum computation is indeed a possibility.
The present chapter starts with presenting common sources of errors in QEC. The
obstacles in introducing the classical error correction codes into quantum case is listed.
Digitization of continuum of quantum errors which is helpful to correct quantum errors
is described. Next, redundant encoding of quantum information and detection of errors
through projective measurement are considered. The stabilizer formalism helpful for setting
QEC codes is introduced. Then the surface code, an efficient QEC model is considered.
Finally, some practical diffuculties in the applications of QEC codes are pointed out.
14.2 Sources of Errors in Quantum Information
Processing
We essentially follow [2] to discuss different sources of quantum errors, their causes and
effects. In [2] various quantum errors and their effects on quantum computations have been
DOI: 10.1201/9781003172192-14 305306 Quantum Error Correction
explained with simple algorithms. Consider a simple algorithm of a single qubit initialized
in the |0i state through N identity operations. If there were no error introduced in these
N-identity operations then the final state will be just |0i:
|ψifinal =
YσI |0i = |0i. (14.1)
The probability of measurement of |0i in such a error free state will be just unity. We will
discuss how do various quantum errors affect the measurement probability of |0i state in
this simple algorithm.
14.2.1 Coherent Quantum Error
Coherent quantum errors arise due to the errors associated with system controls and/or
characterization where imprecise operation on the qubit introduces inaccurate Hamiltonian
dynamics. This type of errors do not produce mixed states from pure states and are called
coherent quantum errors. In the simple algorithm that we considered, we have N times σI
operations sequentially performed on the initial state |0i. Suppose the incorrect character￾ization of the control dynamics, instead of σI , leads to a different identity gate and results
in a small rotation about the x-axis of the Bloch sphere. In this case the final state is given
by (see the exercise 1 at the end of this chapter)
|ψifinal =
Y
N
e
iσx
|0i = cos(N )|0i + i sin(N )|1i. (14.2)
This equation gives the probability of measurement of |0i as P(0) = cos2
(N ) and the
probability of measurement of |1i as P(1) = sin2
(N ). For small N 
P(0) = cos(N ) = 1 − sin2
(N ) ≈ 1 − (N )
2
, P(1) ≈ (N )
2
. (14.3)
As the number of quantum operations increase even a small coherent error  will lead to
wrong results.
14.2.2 Decoherence
We have discussed decoherence in chapter 8. The interaction of environment with the quan￾tum systems leads to decoherence of quantum systems. For simplicity, assume that the envi￾ronment has two orthonormal basis states |e0i and |e1i satisfying the relations hei
|ej i = δij
and |e0ihe0| + |e1ihe1| = I.
Assume that the environment couples to the qubit such that when the qubit is in the
|1i state the effect is flipping the environment state while the qubit is in the |0i state there
is no effect on the environmental state. Instead of N identity operations (σI ), perform two
Hadamard operations (H) separated by a wait stage governed by σI on the initial state |0i.
In this case
|ψifinal = HσIH|0i = |0i. (14.4)
Suppose the environment state |Ei starts with the pure state |Ei = |e0i and the coupling
to the system is such that we have
HσIH|0i|Ei =
1
2
(|0i + |1i)|e0i +
1
2
(|0i − |1i)|e1i. (14.5)Sources of Errors in Quantum Information Processing 307
Assume that the environment interacts with the system only on the wait state σI . As
the decoherence due to environmental interaction transforms pure states into mixed states,
it is convenient to treat the state HσIH|0i|Ei by density matrix representation as
ρf =

(|0ih0| + |0ih1| − |1ih0| − |1ih1|)|e1ihe0| . (14.6)
We are not going to perform the measurement of environmental degrees of freedom. There￾fore, we consider
TrE(ρf) = 1

(|0ih0| + |0ih1| + |1ih0| + |1ih1|)

(|0ih0| − |0ih1| − |1ih0| + |1ih1|)
=

2
(|0ih0| + |1ih1|) . (14.7)
Now, we find that the interaction of the environment on the wait state of HσIH|0i leads
to Eq. (14.7) with measurement probability of |0i state to be 1/2 and that of the state |1i
also to be 1/2. So, the environment decoherence has produced a complete mixture of the
qubit state |0i and |1i with equal probability just like in a classical system. The coupling
of the environment has removed the coherence between the |0i and |1i states. The second
H transform which has to rotate (|0i + |1i)/

14.2.3 Loss, Leakage, Measurement and Initialization Errors
The errors due to qubit loss, qubit leakage, errors in qubit initialization and measurements
can also be modelled in the same way as environmental decoherence.
If PM is the probability of measurement error then the measurement projection on a
qubit can be given as
A = (1 − PM)|0ih0| + PM|1ih1| . (14.10)
Therefore, for a pure state ρ = |0ih0| the probability of measuring a |0i state is given by
P|0i = Tr(Aρ) = (1 − PM) . (14.11)
Then 1 − PM is the probability for measuring the correct result.
Qubit loss can also be modelled as the environmental coupling. A loss of qubit means it
is acutally coupled to the environment. In this case as in Eq. (14.7) A =
1
2
(|0ih0| + |1ih1|).
Comparing it with Eq. (14.10) we find the measurement error probability as PM = 1/2.
We can model the error in the initialization of the qubit using the decoherence model
or coherent symmetric error model depending on the physical mechanisms involved in the
initialization. In the decoherence model if PI
is the initialization error probability, then the
initial state is given by the mixture density of state

In the case of coherent symmetric error model with a coherent unitary operation, the initial
state can be assumed as pure, but have an undesired state, say, |ψiI = α|0i + β|1i, where
|α|

2 = 1 and |β|
2  1.
Qubit leakage errors occur as any two level qubit operation can couple other nearby
quantum levels. For example, an operation U|0i may contain an additional state |2i as
U|0i = α|0i + β|1i + γ|2i. (14.13)
As the computer works with a qubit structure with two level systems, the introduction of
the third level error in a two level algorithm will induce unwanted dynamics. Leakage is one
of the most problematic errors to correct using QEC.
14.3 Difficulties of Using Classical Error Correction
Techniques to QEC
We have discussed many different quantum errors that may arise in quantum machine in
the previous section. Compared to a classical digital machine quantum machines are more
susceptible to making errors. In classical information technologies the binary values 0 and
1 are used to encode in which data is represented as sequences of these two bits. The basic
principle involved in classical error correction is to increase the number of bits more than
is required for a given amount of information. A set of instructions specifying this excess
coding is known as error correction codes [3,4].
Let us give an example of error correction code [5]. Consider the three-bit repetition
code in which each bit value is duplicated as 0 → 000 and 1 → 111. A three-bit encoder
changes the binary alphabet B {0, 1} into a code alphabet C3 = {000, 111}. Assume that it
is desired to communicate a single-bit message 0 to a recipient at an another location. InDifficulties of Using Classical Error Correction Techniques to QEC 309
three-bit coding the word 000 will be sent. Suppose this codeword underwent a flip error
during communication. The received codeword can be 001 or 010 or 100. By deciding the
majority of the bits the recipient can decide the actual original codeword as 000. If the code
000 is subjected to more than one error like 011, 101, 110 and 111 then the recipient will
decide incorrectly, by majority of the bits, the codeword as 111. Theory of classical error
correction is very well developed that any classical error can be satisfactorily corrected.
Unfortunately, the classical methods of error correction cannot be applied to QEC. In
classical information the bits are either in 0 state or in 1 state. Consequently, the only error
possible is the flip-flop of the bits. But in quantum information we consider a superposition
of the two states |0i and |1i as the qubit. So, a general quantum qubit is represented by
|ψi = α|0i + β|1i, |α|
2 + |β|
2 = 1. (14.14)
The qubit given by Eq. (14.14) can vary continuously, unlike the classical bits 0 and 1, as
long as |α|
2 + |β|
2 = 1. Consequently, a qubit is subject to an infinite number of errors.
In a geometrical representation |ψi given by Eq. (14.14) can be written as
|ψi = cos(θ/2)|0i + eiφ
sin(θ/2)|1i, | cos(θ/2)|
2 + |sin(θ/2)|
2 = 1 . (14.15)
In this case a qubit state can represent a point on a Bloch sphere and is specified by θ and
φ. Any qubit error represented by a unitary operator U(δθ, δφ) can rotate the state given
by Eq. (14.15) in the Bloch sphere to a new state as
U(δθ, δφ)|ψi = cos((θ + δθ)/2)|0i + ei(φ+δφ)
sin((θ + δθ)/2)|1i. (14.16)
As δθ and δφ can vary continuously, a qubit is subjectable to a continuum of errors. However,
one can digitize the quantum errors. Then the ability to correct a finite set of errors is enough
to correct any error [6]. As a result of digitization of quantum errors we get two fundamental
error types:
1. Flip-flop error (Pauli X-type error): σx|1i = |0i and σx|0i = |1i.
2. Phase-flip error (Pauli Z-type error): σz|0i = |0i and σz|1i = −|1i.
The phase-flip error has no classical analogue. Even though the digitization of quantum
errors may be useful to apply the classical coding theory to QEC to some extent, a straight￾forward translation of classical codes to quantum codes is not possible.
There are three main obstacles [5] to introduce classical error correction codes into
quantum realm. They are enumerated in the following.
1. A difficulty arises due to the continuous nature of quantum errors as discussed
earlier. As all quantum operations are continuous, it can be implemented only
with a certain precision. A small error can accumulate over many operations and
may add up to a large uncontrollable error.
2. In classical error correction, information is encoded in a redundant way to protect
against errors as expalined earlier. That technique cannot be used in QEC due to
the no-cloning theorem (refer chapter 11). As it is impossible to copy an unknown
quantum system, information cannot be stored in a redundant way as is being
done in classical information processing.
3. Another obstacle arises due to the measurement problem of quantum mechanics.
In order to correct an error we have to acquire some information about the na￾ture and type of error. Hence, we have to perform a measurement on the system.
But any quantum mechanical measurement collapses the quantum system and310 Quantum Error Correction
hence might destroy the information that we have encoded in the quantum state.
Extracting information about the error through the measurement of the quan￾tum system is not possible. Hence, in general the well developed classical error
correction techniques cannot be applied to QEC technique directly.
14.4 Digitization of Quantum Errors
We have seen that a general error can be described by a unitary operator as given by
Eq. (14.16). Varying of δθ and δφ lead to a continuum of quantum errors. Digitization of
quantum errors makes it possible to correct any quantum error using the ability to correct
a finite set of errors [5,6]. This is possible as the coherent noise processes are described by
matrices which can be expanded in terms of the set of three Pauli matrices and the identity
matrix given by
1 =

1 0
0 1 
, X =

1 0 
, Y =

0 −i
i 0 
, Z =

1 0
0 −1

.
As the single-qubit coherent process described by the unitary operator U(δθ, δφ) is a 2 × 2
matrix and as 1, X, Y and Z are linearly independent the 2 × 2 matrix U(δθ, δφ) can be
expanded as a linear combination of the four matrices. Hence, Eq. (14.16) can be expanded
as
U(δθ, δθ)|ψi = αI1|ψi + αXX|ψi + αY Y |ψi + αZZ|ψi. (14.17)
QEC process involves performing projective measurements that cause the superposition
given by Eq. (14.15) to collapse to a subset of its terms. Consequently, a QEC code with the
ability to correct errors described by the X and Z Pauli matrices will be able to correct any
coherent errors. So, only the X-type of errors (bit-flips) and Z-type of errors (phase-flips)
are the two fundamental error types to be accounted by quantum correction codes.
14.5 QEC Mechanisms Using Quantum Redundancy
The simplest possible error correction code in the classical information theory is the rep￾etition code in which each bit is replaced by three of its copies: 0 → 000 and 1 → 111. If
any one of the bits in this code is fliped by taking a majority decision then we can correctly
decode the information. If two or three bits flip then we cannot correctly decode the infor￾mation. But this idea of classical error correction cannot be extended to QEC as there is
no way to copy quantum information. Moreover, as we have discussed earlier, in addition
to the bit-flip errors, there are phase-flip errors and combinations of both errors. It is not
possible to do measurement for taking a majority decision without causing disturbance to
the quantum codes. These problems were solved by Shor [7].
14.5.1 The Two-Qubit Error Correction Code
Shor proposed that redundancy can be added in quantum codes by expanding the Hilbert
space in which the qubits are encoded. To explain how it is done consider an example ofQEC Mechanisms Using Quantum Redundancy 311
a two-qubit code designed to detect a single-bit flip error [5]. |ψi = α|0i + β|1i is encoded
using CNOT gate to get |ψiL, where L stands for logical. The action is
|ψi = α|0i + β|1i
two−qubit encoder
−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−→ |ψiL , (14.18)
where
|ψiL = α|00i + β|11i = α|0iL + β|1iL . (14.19)
After encoding we get the logical codewords |0iL = |00i and |1iL = |11i. |ψiL is not a
cloning of |ψi.
As the encoding operation has distributed the quantum information in the initial state
|ψi across the two-party logical state |ψiL, we can use this redundancy for error detection.
|ψi = α|0i+β|1i is a vector in a two-dimensional Hilbert space H2, spanned by the kets |0i
and |1i. Encoding has made the logical qubit to occupy a four-dimensional Hilbert space
H4 spanned by the kets |00i, |01i, |10i and |11i. The logical qubit |ψiL is defined in a
two-dimensional subspace of H4 spanned by |00i and |11i. Let us call this space as the code
space C.
Suppose a bit-flip flop is introduced to the encoded |ψiL so that X1|ψiL = α|10i+β|01i,
where X1 is a bit-flip error acting on the first qubit. Now, we get a new subspace of H4
spanned by |01i and |10i. Let us call F as error subspace. If no error occurs then the logical
state |ψiL occupies C-code space and a single qubit flip-flop error makes it to occupy the error
subspace F. The subspace of C and F are mutually orthogonal. Therefore, it is now possible
to do a projective measurement without compromising the uncoded quantum information
to know whether the logical qubit is in C or F subspace. This type of measurements are
called stabilizer measurements. For example, a stabilizer operator Z1Z2 can be used for the
projective measurement in this case to differentiate C and F subspaces as
Z1Z2|ψiL = Z1Z2 (α|00i + β|11i)

= (+1)|ψiL . (14.20)
The Z1Z2 operator projects the error state X1|ψiL and X2|ψiL into the (−1) eigenspace.
The measurement of Z1Z2 has not changed α and β the coefficients of |ψi [8]. Hence, the
projective measurement Z1Z2 has not disturbed the quantum information.
A three stage quantum circuit can be set-up for the implementation of the two-qubit
code [5]. Stage I uses a CNOT gate to entangle |ψi to get the logical code |ψiL with a
redundancy qubit. In the second stage, the logical qubit |ψiL may be subject to a bit-flip
error E. In the third stage, an ancilla qubit |0iA is introduced to perform the measurement
of the Z1Z2 stabilizer. This stage contains the ancilla qubit measurement. The coutcome of
the ancilla qubit measurement is referred as a syndrome which gives information whether
the logical state has been subject to error or not. This stage is the syndrome extraction
stage where the state E|ψiL is transformed as
E|ψiL|0iA

+
1
2
(1112 − Z1Z2) E|ψiL|1iA . (14.21)312 Quantum Error Correction
In Eq. (14.21) E is an error from the set {1, X1, X2, X1X2}. If E = X1 or X2 then E|ψiL
will be in the F subspace. In this case the first term in right-side of Eq. (14.21) becomes zero.
Hence, the ancilla qubit is determined as 1. The ancilla is measured as 0 if E = {1, X1X2}.
The syndrome bit S corresponding to the outcomes of a stabilizer measurement for the
errors 1112 and X1X2 is 0 while for the errors X112 and 11X2 is 1.
Solved Problem 2:
Show that in the syndrome extraction given by Eq. (14.21), for E = {1, X1X2} ancilla is
measured as 0 and for {X1, X2} ancilla is measured as 1.
We have Z|1i = −|1i, Z|0i = |0i and Z1 operates on the first ket, Z2 operates on the second
ket. Also, X|1i = |0i and X|0i = |1i.
For E = 1 we find
E|ψiL = 1|ψiL = |ψiL, (14.22a)
1112|ψiL = |ψiL, (14.22b)
Z1Z2|ψiL = (+1)|ψiL. (14.22c)
So, the second term in Eq. (14.21) is 1
2
(1112|ψiL − Z1Z2|ψiL)|1iA = 0. Hence, for E = 1
we get only the first term in Eq. (14.21). Then the ancilla qubit is just |0i.
For E = X1X2 as X1|ψiL = α|10i + β|01i we get
E|ψiL = X1X2 (α|00i + β|11i)
= α|11i + β|00i, (14.23a)
1112E|ψiL = α|11i + β|00i, (14.23b)
Z1Z2E|ψiL = Z1 (Z2 (α|11i + β|00i))
= Z1 (−α|11i + β|00i)
= α|11i + β|00i. (14.23c)
Then 1112E|ψiL − Z1Z2E|ψiL = 0. So, E = X1X2 error also gives the ancilla qubit in |0i
state.
Next, for E = X1
E|ψiL = X1|ψiL = α|10i + β|01i, (14.24a)
1112E|ψiL = α|10i + β|01i, (14.24b)
Z1Z2E|ψiL = Z1 (Z2 (α|10i + β|01i))
= Z1 (α|10i − β|01i)
= −α|10i − β|01i. (14.24c)
The first term in Eq. (14.21) becomes (1112 + Z1Z2) X1|ψiL = 0. The ancilla gives the
state |1i. So, it is measured as 1. Similarly, (1112 + Z1Z2) X2|ψiL = 0. Again, for E = X2
the ancilla will be measured as 1.
14.5.2 The Three-Qubit Error Correction Code
What do we get from the syndrome created in the two-qubit code? It simply informs the
presence of an error. It does not provide sufficient message to identify the bit where the
error has occurred. It is necessary to develop an error correction code to identify and localizeQEC Mechanisms Using Quantum Redundancy 313

the errors. For this purpose multiple stabilizer measurements can be done. A three-bit code
will give a basic introduction to both detect and localize the errors.
The three-qubit code encodes a single logical qubit into three logical qubits. The encod￾ing operation distributes the quantum information across an entangled three-party state.
The two logical basis states are defined as |0iL = |000i and |1iL = |111i. The arbitrary
single qubit state |ψi = α|0i + β|1i is mapped to
α|0i + β|1i −→ α|0iL + β|1iL −→ α|000i + β|111i = |ψiL . (14.25)
|ψi can be encoded to get |ψiL using two initialized ancilla qubits via CNOT gates.
The dimension of the Hilbert space occupied by |ψiL is eight. This Hilbert space H8
is spanned by the basis {|000i, |001i, |010i, |011i, |100i, |101i, |110i, |111i}. H8 can be
partitioned into four subspaces as given below:
C = span {|000i, |111i} , F1 = span {|100i, |011i} ,
F2 = span {|010i, |101i} , F3 = span {|001i, |110i} ,
where C is the logical code space and F1, F2 and F3 are logical error spaces. Any error
E1 rotates C into any of the three error space. The four subspaces can be distinguished
by carrying out two stabilizer measurements Z1Z2 and Z2Z3. This can be done using the
circuit shown in Fig. 14.1. Table 14.1 gives the syndrome S for all the bit-errors. We find
from this table that each single-qubit error gives a unique two-bit syndrome S = s1s2. It
will help us to choose a suitable recovery operation.
14.5.3 Quantum Code Distance
The minimum size of the undetectable error is called a quantum code distance d [5]. This
is also a logical Pauli operation that transforms one codeword to another. For example, in
the three qubit code, we find that Pauli-X operator X = X1X2X3 transforms X|0iL = |1iL
and X|1iL = |0iL. d = 3 if the qubits in the three-qubit code are exposed to only X-errors.
For phase-flip errors the Pauli Z-operator Z = Z1Z2Z3 will determine d. To find d for the314 Quantum Error Correction

(|000i + |111i) and |−iL =

√
2
(|000i − |111i) . (14.27)
As Z = Z1 will transform Z|+iL = |−iL the code cannot detect the presence of a single
qubit phase-flip error. Consequently, the three qubit code has d = 1 if we consider both X￾and Z-errors.
14.6 QEC with Stabilizer Codes
We have seen that for the three-qubit code if an X-error occurs then it can be detected via
a sequence of two stabilizer measurements Z1Z2 and Z2Z3. First, we describe the general￾ization of this scheme to create [[n, k, d]] stabilizer codes, where n is the total number of
qubits, k is the number of logical qubits and d is the code distance [5].
14.6.1 Creation of Stabilizer Codes
Figure 14.2 depicts the basic quantum circuit for an [[n, k, d]] stabilizer code. For the ith
stabilizer Pi the mapping of the logical states by the syndrome extracting circuit is done as

When Pi commutes with E then the measurement of ancilla qubit Ai returns 0 while in
the case of anticommuting 1 is returned. Therefore, a good code can be constructed if a
stabilizer anticommuting with error E can be found. An m-bit syndrome can be obtained
by combining the outcomes of m stabilizer measurements. These syndromes can be utilized
to get the best recovery operator to reinstate the logical state to the codespace.

the elements from the direct product of the single-qubit Pauli group G1 =
{±1, ±i1, ±X, ±iX, ±Y, ±iY, ±Z, ±iZ}.

|ψiL = (+1), that is, the stabilizers
must stabilize the logical states of the codes.
3. [Pi
, Pj ] = 0 for all i and j, that is, the stabilizers must commute with each other.
The n − k stabilizers needed for syndrome extraction must be a minimal set of the
stabilizer group. An [[n, k, d]] stabilizer code has 2k logical operators Li which allows logical
states to be modified without having to decode and then encode. Any LiPj is also a logical
operator as 1iPj |ψiL = Li
|ψiL.
14.6.2 An Error Correction Scheme
Let us denote the number of correctable errors as t. It is given by t = (d − 1)/2. t is ≥ 1 for
d ≥ 3. Therefore, the stabilizer codes with d ≥ 3 are essentially error correction codes. For
these codes recovery operations have to be applied. The use of stabilizer codes to describe
QEC codes is highly useful. It allows for easy synthesis of correction circuits and also shows
how logical operations can be performed directly on encoded data.
For a single cycle of an [[n, k, d]] stabilizer code an error correction scheme is the following
[5]. The encoded |ψiL goes through the error process E. Next, making use of the syndrome
extraction method the code stabilizers are measured. Then the measured results are copied
to a register of m = n − k ancilla qubits |Ai
⊗m. The m-bit syndrome S are found from
the reading of the ancilla qubits. Then decoding process is performed. A decoding circuit
processes the syndrome to identify the best unitary operation R in order to send |ψiL to
the codespace. The decoding process is considered as success if
RE|ψiL = (+1)|ψiL . (14.29)
Any RE which is an element of the code stabilizer with RE = P ∈ S will satisfy Eq. (14.29).
Note that R is not unique because one can set-up degenerate codes with mapping of multiple
errors to the same syndrome.316 Quantum Error Correction
14.6.3 The Shor Nine-Qubit Code
The first QEC code was developed by Shor [7]. It is a nine-qubit error correcting code and
is an example of a code with d = 3 and k = 1. The code is thus denoted as [[9, 1, 3]].
It can be used to correct a logical qubit from one bit flip-flop (X-error) or one discrete
phase-flip (Z)-error or one of each on any of the nine qubits. So, it can correct any linear
combination of errors on a single qubit. Shor code can be constructed by a method known
as code concatenation [5].
In the code concatenation, the output of one code is embedded into the input of another.
Two codes are concatenated in the Shor nine-qubit codes. They are the three-qubit code
for phase-flip and the three-qubit code for the bit-flip [9]. The three-qubit codes for bit-flip
and phase flip are defined as
C3b = span {|0i3b = |000i, |1i3b = |111i} ,
S3b = hZ1Z2, Z2Z3i, (14.30)
C3p = span {|0i3p = | + ++i, |1i3p = | − −−i} ,
S3p = hX1X2, X2X3i, (14.31)
respectively. To get the Shor code the bit-flip code is embedded into codewords of phase-flip
codes as
|0i3p = | + ++i
concatenation
−−−−−−−−−−−→ |0i9 = |+i3b|+i3b|+i3b (14.32)
and

where

(|000i ± |111i) . (14.34)
Then for the Shor code [[9, 1, 3]], in computational basis, the codes space C[[9,1,3]] and the
corresponding stabilizers S[[9,1,3]] are given by

X1X2X3X4X5X6, X4X5X6X7X8X9i. (14.36)
In S[[9,1,3]] the terms Z1Z2, . . . , Z8Z9 are the stabilizers for the bit-flip codes and are in the
three blocks of codes. The stabilizers X1X2X3X4X5X6 and X4X5X6X7X8X9 are for the
phase-flip codes. The encoded Shor’s nine bit code is
|ψiL = α|0i9 + β|1i9 . (14.37)
The syndrome for all the single-qubit errors on the Shor’s nine-qubit code can be easily
set-up. From this table one can observe that unique syndromes result from the X-errors.
But same syndrome is produced by the Z-errors occurring in the same block of the codes.
Even though we have the degeneracy in the code syndromes, it does not affect the code
distance. So, this nine-qubit code is able to correct all single-qubit errors and d = 3.The Surface Code 317

14.7 The Surface Code
Finding the commuting sets of stabilizers for identifying errors without altering the encoded
information to create QEC is very difficult. Special code construction models are necessary
to determine such stabilizers. One such efficient error correction model is the surface code
[10–14]. It is defined over a two-dimensional lattice of qubits. It can be implemented on
architectures that only allow for the coupling of nearest neighbour qubits. It also has the
highest fault-tolerent thresholds of any QEC scheme. Moreover, the surface code can correct
problematic error channels such as qubit loss and leakage. We give below the outline of
constructing the surface code [10–12]. It is one of the efficient QEC codes among a variety
of topological codes [15] in which code structure is defined on a lattice and scaling of the
code to correct more errors is conceptually straight-forward.
Surface codes are given in a pictorial representation of the code qubits instead of quan￾tum circuits [5,16]. Figure 14.3a shows a surface code four-cycle which is the fundamental
building block of other surface codes. The open circles D1 and D2 represent the code (data)
qubits and the squares A1 and A2 represent ancilla qubits. The edges with thin lines rep￾resent controlled X gates. The thick line edges represent controlled Z operation. They are
controlled by ancilla qubits and action on data qubits. A1 (A2) connects to D1 and D2
via the thin (thick) edges and hence the stabilizer measured is XD1XD2
(ZD1ZD2
). Figure
14.3b gives the same surface codes four-cycle in circuit notation.
In the four-cycle surface code, the total number of qubits and the number of stabilizers
both are 2, that is, n = m = 2. Thus, the number of logical qubits it codes is k = n − m =
2 − 2 = 0. This indicates that the four-cycle is not a useful code. However, multiple four￾cycles can be used to form square lattices for realizing quantum detection and correction
codes. As an example, we discuss the five-qubit surface code [[5, 1, 2]] formed by tiling four
four-cycles in square lattice [17].
In the pictorial representation of the surface code [[5, 1, 2]], there are five data qubits
(D1, D2, D3, D4, D5) and four ancilla qubits (A1, A2, A3, A4). D3 is at the centre and the
other D’s are at the four corners. A1 and A4 are at the top and the bottom, respectiverly.
A2 and A3 are at the left-side and the right-side, respectively, of the lattice. The ancilla
qubit A1 connects the data qubits D1, D2 and D3 via thin lines. A4 connects D3, D4 and
D5 via thin lines. The ancilla qubit A2 (A3) connects the data qubits D1 (D2), D4 (D5)318 Quantum Error Correction
and D3 via thick lines. By looking at how each ancilla qubit connects the data qubits the
stabilizers of the code corresponding to A1 − A4 is [5]

, ZD2ZD3ZD5
,
XD3XD4XD5
i. (14.38)
As n = 5 and m = 4 this code encodes n − m = 1 logical qubit.
Next, consider two examples of errors on [[5, 2, 1]] and their detection. Suppose there
is a ZD1
-error on the qubit D1. ZD1 anticommutes with the stabilizer XD1XD2XD3
. The
result is triggering of 1 syndrome measurement in A1. In the pictorial form, this can be
depicted by representing A1 by a filled square. In the second example, say, XD5
error is in
D5. XD5
anticommutes with ZD2ZD3ZD5
and thereby triggers a 1 syndrome measurement
in A3. Filled square is now used to represent A3.
As described above the surface code is considered as a square lattice with two types of
boundaries, namely, thin line and thick line. The thin (thick) lines of horizontal (vertical)
boundaries are associated with the X-type (Z-type) stabilizer measurements. Chains of
Pauli operators along the edges of these boundaries give the logical operators of the surface
code. Let the Pauli operator X = XD1XD4
acts along the vertical boundary along which
Z-type stabilizers are measured. Next, say, the Pauli operator Z = ZD1ZD2
acts along the
horizontal boundary along which X-type stabilizers are measured. Both X = XD1XD4
and
Z = ZD1ZD2
commute with all the stabilizers in [[5, 1, 2]] given by Eq. (14.38). Moreover,
X and Z are anticommuting with themselves (see the solved problem 3). The Pauli-X and
Pauli-Z logical operators for each encoded qubits are pairs of operators. They anticommute
with one another and commute with all code stabilizers. Thus, we have found suitable logical
operators of the [[5, 1, 2]] surface code as X and Z. As the minimum weight of the logical
operation is 2 the five-qubit surface code [[5, 1, 2]] is a detection code with d = 2.
Solved Problem 3:
Show that X = XD1XD4
and Z = ZD1ZD2
anticommute and they commute with
XD1XD2XD3
and ZD1ZD3ZD4
X and Z operating on different bits commute. Using this result, we obtain
X Z + Z X = XD1XD4ZD1ZD2 + ZD1ZD2XD1XD4
= XD1ZD1XD4ZD2 + ZD1XD1ZD2XD4
= XD1ZD1XD4ZD2 + ZD1XD1XD4ZD2

Therefore, XD1ZD1 = −ZD1XD1

That is, X and Z anticommute.Practical Issues in the Implementation of QEC Codes 319

14.8 Practical Issues in the Implementation of
QEC Codes
We have discussed the procedure to correct the quantum errors by assuming that errors do
not occur on ancilla qubits. We have not taken into consideration that systematic errors may
be introduced by the quantum gates themselves. In the hardware implementation of QEC
codes practical difficulties occur. It is thus imperative that any error correction procedure
and logical operations need to be designed such that these errors are also get corrected. In
this section let us point out certain practical issues in the implementation of QEC codes
[2,5].
14.8.1 Fault Tolerance
If a QEC code is capable of accounting errors occurring at anywhere in a quantum circuit
then it is called a fault tolerant [18,19]. In the fault tolerant quantum correction code, the
quantum circuits involved in gate operations and error correction schemes should not lead
to errors to propagate. To avoid the propagation of errors quantum circuits need to be
modified. There are certain techniques proposed for this purpose [18–27].
Consider the quantum circuits given in Fig. 14.4. The circuit in Fig. 14.4a is a CNOT
circuit with out an error for the transformation |110i|010i → |110i|101i. In Fig. 14.4b, a
single X-error is assumed to occur on the top most qubit. This single error will cascade
and propagate to four qubits. Figure 14.4c presents a modified quantum circuit for the
transformation |110i|010i → |110i|101i. In this circuit, the same X-error propagates to
only two of the six qubits. If we consider the each three single logical qubit as a single block
then the circuit of Fig. 14.4c introduces only a single error in each block.
A standard definition of a fault tolerant circuit element is that [2] a single error will
cause at most one error in the output for each logical qubit block . Of course, the above
definition is valid only for a single error correcting code. If a code corrects t = [(d − 1)/2]
errors then the requirement for fault tolerance is that any error less than or equal to t should
not lead to errors greater than t in the output for each logical qubit. For modifying a QEC
circuit for fault tolerance we may need additional ancilla qubits. In general, a fault tolerant
modified circuit will always have increased overhead compared to the original circuit.320 Quantum Error Correction

case of a single X-error. (c) A modified equivalent circuit where one error propagates to
two errors only.
14.8.2 Threshold Theorem
The ability to perform dynamical error correction depends on a threshold of a code given
by the threshold theorem [2,28]. We explain the importance of the code threshold where
a quantum code is utilized to correct only a single error, using a model that assumes
uncorrelated errors on individual qubits.
Let us assume the probability per gate operation for each physical qubit to encounterPractical Issues in the Implementation of QEC Codes 321
either an X or Z or both errors independently. Further, a cycle of error correction is done
after each elementary gate operation consistent with the rules of fault tolerance. This ensures
that this error will only propagate to at most one error in each block. Then a cycle of error
correction will remove the error. Therefore, the occurrence of two or more errors alone makes
the logical step fail. With p as the failure probability of un-encoded qubits per step, the
failure rate p
1
L
of each logical gate operation of a 1st level logical qubit is cp2
[2]. Here c is
the maximum of the number of 2-error combinations. Suppose in all the levels of operations
same gate operations and same error correction schemes are employed. We write

If cp < 1 then p

can be made as small as possible by increasing the number of iterations k.
Note that cp < 1 defines the threshold. Thus, any large quantum circuit can be successfully
implemented provided pth < 1/c. Of course, more resources will be needed. The computation
of threshold is an extremely important in designing quantum architecture [28–35].
14.8.3 Finding Efficient Decoding Algorithms From Code Syndromes
A decoder must find out the most appropriate recovery operation R to recover the encoded
information to the codespace from the measurement of the stabilizers which produce the
syndrome S, An [[n, k, d]] code gives an m = n − k-bit syndrome. Therefore, there are
2
m possible syndromes for each code. Making use of the syndrome tables it is possible to
find the best R-operator for small code examples discussed in this chapter. When the code
size increases it is impractical to find a decoding strategy. In the case of the surface code
[[41, 1, 5]], the number of possible syndromes is 2m = 240 ≈ 1012. That is, the look-up
table of syndrome will have the size ≈ 1012. Many other interference techniques have been
developed and used to find the mostly likely error that can happen for a given syndrome.
But so far an universal decoder is not achieved.
14.8.4 Fault Tolerant Computation
As any quantum information processing need computations to be performed by logical
gates, these gates may also be faulty. Therefore, the gate operations must be done without
introducing errors uncontrollable and also following the guidelines of fault tolerance. A
universal quantum computer performs an unitary operation U leading to U|ψi = |ψ
0
i,
that is, U evolves a qubit register from one state to another. Any unitary operation can
be effectively performed with a set of elementary gates. A prime challenge in establishing a
universal encoded gate set is to determine the schemes by which the gate operations can be
performed following the rules of fault tolerance. For many codes, a subset of universal gates
performing fault tolerantly can be identified. This is achieved with logical operators having
a property known as transversality. This property ensures that error will not spread in the
quantum circuit uncontrollably. But no-go theorem prohibits any such implementation of
a full universal gate [36]. Other methods are available but they all require more number of
additional qubits [37322 Quantum Error Correction
14.9 Concluding Remarks
Efficient quantum algorithms make use of large scale quantum interference which is sensitive
to imprecision in the computer and to unwanted coupling between the quantum states and
environment. Large scale quantum computation and information processing is practically
impossible unless efficient error correction methods are used. This chapter has discussed the
stabilizer formalism, basic idea on circuit synthesis and fault tolerant circuit construction.
The usefulness of stabilizers in investigating the properties of error correction codes is
explained. It is possible to correct and suppress any quantum error at least in principle if
certain threshold conditions on the qubits are satisfied. Unfortunately, any effective QEC
protocols need large number of qubits and thereby increasing the expenses associated with
the quantum computing.
We have given the basics of the surface code which is the most used QEC scheme.
But there are certain drawbacks with the surface code. Alternatives to the surface code
have been proposed but they have low thresholds. When developing a large scale quantum
computer the actual quantum code and the error correction procedure must be effectively
incorporated. There are many challenges to be overcome in building a circuit model of
quantum computer. Methods for realization and control of qubits have to be improved very
much. Theoretically finding better ways to achieve fault tolerant error correction is a major
challenge.
Some notable advancements in the field of QEC include theory of QEC for general noise
[41], new codes and their bounds [42], analog QEC routines [43], effects of multiple-particle
interference [44] and mixed state entanglement [45], geometries of QEC codes [46,47], ex￾perimental demonstration of QEC [48–55], optimization of QEC [56,57] and applications to
communication [58 metrology [59] and quantum memories [60].

Some Other Advanced Topics
15.1 Introduction
In the earlier chapters, we presented basic features of certain advanced topics including
supersymmetric quantum mechanics, coherent and squeezed states, Berry’s phase, quan￾tum entanglement, quantum decoherence, quantum computers, quantum cryptography and
quantum cloning. There are several other topics which also received considerable interest
and have a wide range of applications. In the present chapter, we consider some of them.
Particularly, we give a very brief introduction to the following fascinating topics:
1. Quantum gravity.
2. Quantum cosmology.
3. Quantum Zeno effect.
4. Quantum teleportation.
5. Quantum games.
6. Quantum pseudo-telepathy games.
7. Quantum steering.
8. Quantum diffusion.
9. Quantum chaos.
There are several other interesting and important topics like quantum Hall effect, quan￾tum dots, quantum annealing, quantum brain dynamics, quantum consciousness etc. These
are not covered in this book.
15.2 Quantum Theory of Gravity
Quantum physics deals with the behaviour of microscopic objects whereas the general rel￾ativity deals with much larger bodies. Both theories have limitations in their abilities to
describe the universe. At present we do not have a full theory because such a theory must
be based on a single framework but such a theory is lacking. In the present forms, quantum
theory and relativity cannot make predictions about certain kinds of physical phenomena.
These phenomena are found to occur at extremely small distances of the order of Planck
length or at very high energies − some 20 orders of magnitude far from the scales of particle
accelerators.
Planck units are measurement units defined in terms of five universal constants
namely, the gravitational constant (G = 6.673 × 10−11 m3kg−1
s
−2
), reduced Planck
constant (~ = 1.055 × 10−34 Js), speed of light (c = 108 m/s), Coulomb constant

) = 1.416785 × 1032 K. A theory of quantum gravity is essential to describe the
situations at these Planck’s scales. For example, understanding the universe where it was
at a time less than one Planck time (∼ 10−44 s) old needs a theory of quantum gravity. At
Planck temperature (∼ 1032 K) all the forces of nature may be unified. At energies of the
order of Planck energy the gravitational interactions are strong enough and we cannot ne￾glect them. The theory we are looking for must unify Einstein’s theory of gravity, relativity
and also the quantum theory and hence is called a quantum theory of gravity.
Because the problems in quantum gravity are so big and very fundamental, there is
generally more than one place to begin. Some of the starting points are the following:
1. Modification of quantum theory by taking account of the gravitational force.
2. Modification of quantum theory by incorporating the principles of relativity.
3. Stating the general relativity in quantum mechanical description.
There are groups of people focusing with different starting points. We now have various
approaches to quantum gravity, with different names such as string theory, loop quantum
gravity, twistor theory, random geometry, toposes and so on. In this section we present some
basic ideas and the features of quantum gravity.
15.2.1 Three Approaches of Quantum Gravity [1]
In the following we give a compact summary of fundamental ideas of the approaches of
semiclassical gravity, loop quantum gravity and string theory.
1. Semiclassical Gravity
The coupling of quantum theory and classical gravity, called semiclassical gravity,was
proposed by Jesper Moller Grimstrup and Leon Rosenfeld in which the Einstein field equa￾tions are written as
Gµν = 8πG hψ|Tµν|ψi. (15.1)
Here Tµν is an operator. The energy-valued tensor of matter Tµν is replaced by an expec￾tation value. This model gives rise to a nonlinear Schr¨odinger equation. So, the principle
of superposition here fails and further it violates the basics of quantum mechanics. There￾fore, to couple a quantum system to classical gravity, we need to modify either the general
relativity or quantum mechanics.
In the semiclassical approach, matter is dealt with quantum mechanically and space-time
is treated as per the general theory of relativity. Certain intriguing predictions are made by
this approach. For example, a particle detector accelerated, say, with the acceleration g in a
vacuum will behave as if it was kept in a thermal bath at temperature hg/(2πc). According
to this, a black hole appears as a hot thermodynamic system with a temperature inversely
proportional to its mass and entropy.
2. Loop Quantum Gravity
In this theory, the effects of quantum gravity are not treated as excitations of a classical
geometry. It predicts that measures like areas and volumes are discrete. These quantities
are represented by operators and possess discrete spectra. This theory succeeds in problemsQuantum Theory of Gravity 329
where string theory fails and vice-versa. In this sense, the loop quantum gravity is thought
of as a complementary to string theory.
3. String Theory
String theory is formulated as a theory of everything with gravity and the other funda￾mental interactions. In this theory, gravitons are regarded as particles travelling in a fixed
non-dynamical space-time. These particles scatter and interact weakly with each other.
Further, they are the excitations of one-dimensional curves known as strings instead of
point-like objects. All the other particles and forces in nature are thought of as arising from
the excitations of the strings. Thus, particles such as electrons, quarks, photons correspond
to modes of vibration of the string. The strings possess a characteristic length scale. Ex￾periments at energies below Planck energy cannot resolve distances which are as small as
Planck length. Thus, at such energies, strings can be approximated by point-like particles.
Five consistent string theories are known. Four of them have only closed strings forming
closed loops. Of these four, two are based on unoriented strings: One has an open string and
the other a closed string. Two other theories are formulated with oriented closed strings
differing in internal symmetry. One of these is called type-II string theory and other as
heterotic string theory. It is indeed remarkable that the spectra of the classical solutions
of all the string theories have exactly one massless spin graviton. In physical theories, the
number of dimensions is generally a free parameter and usually fixed to three. But string
theory predicts 9 spatial dimensions. This is the only theory known so far that unifies the
quantum theory and general relativity. It was realized that every string theory describes a
limit of an underlying general theory called M-theory defined in 11 dimensions of space.
15.2.2 Pictures of the Physical World [1]
Combining the predictions of different approaches of quantum gravity we will be able to
describe the physical world. This picture may not be correct, but provides a certain kind of
complete picture that experimentalists may realize if they probe Planck scale. Some of the
main features are the following:
1. Space, time and all physical quantities are regarded as relations between things
in the world. The theory knows nothing of points in space or events in time. It
knows only details of relations between things that occur.
2. The fundamental of the world is information instead of fields.
3. Quantities such as area, volume and electric charge are discrete.
4. The basic excitations are not thought of as point-like but are one or more dimen￾sional.
5. Observable quantities are only connected with information flowing across the
boundaries between the observer and the system. The theory does not predict the
events happening in space-time but provides information reached by an observer.
6. There is a restriction on the quantum of information flowing across any surface in
space. There will not be more bits of information than the surface area, measured
in units of Planck area – G~/c3 ≈ 10−70 m2
. In other words, only one bit of
information can flow across every 10−70 m2
.
7. The value of electric charge, masses of particles, etc. may vary with time.
8. Distinctions between different particles and forces are because of symmetry break￾ing.330 Some Other Advanced Topics

15.2.3 Implications of Quantum Gravity
There are many different approaches for quantizing gravity. A fully acceptable theory is yet
to emerge. However, many implications of quantum gravity found to exist for a range of
phenomena in our every day physics. Some of them are listed below [2]:
1. It has been estimated that in sun, 109 W of thermal gravitational radiation could
be generated because of Coulomb collisions in the plasma core. The number of
gravitons, Ng, emitted in an explosion of energy E is Ng = GE2/(~c
5
). For a 100
megaton nuclear explosion, the above predicts a dimensionless strain of 10−31
.

~c
∼ 1035 s, (15.2)
where me is the mass of the electron, ωhyd is the frequency of the 3d-1s transition
and α is the fine structure constant.

collapse in a comoving frame is

4. Table 15.1 gives upper limits of certain physical quantities.
5. A possible smallest time interval is p
~G/c5 ∼ 10−43 s.
6. The highest power generated or emitted by a physical system is
Pmax ∼

G

That is, a universal bound on the rate of information processing is
f =

Pmax/~ ∼ 1044 bits/s. (15.5)
7. It is possible to have photons with energies ∼ 1020 eV or larger.
8. Photons with a few TeV energy will be able to travel freely through the back￾ground of microwave or infrared photons.Quantum Cosmology 331
9. String theory implies a modification of the Heisenberg’s uncertainty princi￾p
ple. The uncertainties in the position and momentum of a string are ∆x ≈
~/T and ∆px ≈
√
~T, where T is the string tension.

So far there is no experimental evidence for quantized gravity. If the gravitational field is
not quantized then violation of the uncertainty principle will result [3].
15.2.4 Tests Proposed to Detect Quantum Gravity
The characteristic energy scale for quantum gravity is Planck energy ∼ 1019 GeV. This is so
far out of the range of experiment. Hence, direct tests appear impossible. However, certain
tests have been proposed.
1. Quantum gravity may lead to violation of the equivalence principle. This may be
detectable in precision tests in atomic and neutron interferometry.
2. It may lead to violations of CPT invariance, for example, with the formation of
virtual black holes. Present experimental techniques are greatly improving and
thus such effects may be observable.
3. Quantum gravity may distort the dispersion relations over long distances for light
and neutrinos. This leads to a frequency-dependent speed of light. This effect can
be testable with the observations of gamma ray bursts.
4. Quantum fluctuations may be noticeable in the geometry of space with the help
of a sensitive interferometer suitable for gravitational wave detection.
5. It has been suggested that the use of lasers to accelerate electrons may open the
possibility to indirectly observe Unruh radiation (a black-body radiation observed
by an accelerated observer) which is the counterpart of Hawking radiation for the
case of an accelerating particle in flat space-time.
6. Another test is from condensed matter analogs of black holes which emit Hawking
radiation phonons from sonic horizons, regions where the fluid flow attains the
speed of sound.
Though these experiments open the possibility of detecting quantum gravitational effects,
at present it is not at all certain that they are feasible. For more discussions on quantum
gravity one may refer to refs. [4–8].
15.3 Quantum Cosmology
Both classical cosmology and quantum cosmology aim to provide answer to the fundamental
question − Where did it all come from? Quantum cosmology is considered an application of
quantum mechanics to the universe as a whole. If the universe is considered as a quantum332 Some Other Advanced Topics
system then it must be described by a quantum state vector which contains all the possible
information one can obtain about the universe. As we usually associate quantum mechanical
wave functions to micro-systems it may seen as a paradox to associate wave function to the
whole universe. But when the evolution of the universe is tracked backwards we reach a
point near Planck scale, where the classical description of the universe has to be replaced
by the quantum description.
15.3.1 Classical Cosmology
The classical cosmology theory is mainly based on the cosmological principle and the ex￾pansion of the universe. As the universe appears to be isotropic and homogeneous the
cosmological principle says that there is no special location in the universe. As the distant
galaxies are observed to be red-shifted, the universe is expanding as given by Hubble law
which states that the recessional velocity is proportional to the distance of the galaxy.
Howard P. Robertson [9] and Arthur Geoffrey Walker [10] derived first independently
the metric of the space-time for all isotropic homogeneous uniformly expanding model of
the universe. It is given as


(15.7)
in terms of the comoving coordinates (t, r, θ, φ). In fact, it is the only space-time metric
which gives homogeneity and isotropy of co-moving universe. Here Q(t) is the expansion
factor. The curvature factor k denoting the spatial curvature of the three-space takes one of
the possible three values −1, 0 or +1. The universe is negatively curved, flat or positively
curved as k = −1, k = 0 or k = +1.
The metric and the curvature is determined by solving the Einstein field equations
relating the geometry of space-time to the distribution of mass energy. These equations are
ten coupled, nonlinear and partial differential equations. It was Alexander Alexandrovich
Friedmann [11] who obtained the solutions of Einstein field equations for the line element
Eq. (15.7). Einstein equations are given in tensor form as
Gµν = 8πGTµν. (15.8)
The Einstein tensor Gµν is a function of the metric and its first and second space-time
derivatives. Tµν is the stress-energy tensor which represents the matter and energy distri￾bution. G is the gravitational constant. The expanding, homogeneous and isotropic universe
is described by the Friedmann–Robertson–Walker (FRW) line element Eq. (15.7).
In FRW universe the stress-energy tensor is taken to be that of a perfect fluid with
its density ρ(Q) and pressure P(Q). Then the ten nonlinear equations given by Eq. (15.8)
reduce to two independent equations

Equations (15.9) and (15.11) are considered as the dynamical equations of big-bang cosmol￾ogy [12]. To determine Q(t), ρ(Q) and P(Q) we have only the two Eqs. (15.9) and (15.11).
The third equation is given by the matter equation of state P = P(ρ).
If we consider the configuration of the universe consisting of electromagnetic radiation
and a pressureless dust then their matter equation of state may be written as
P(ρ) = γ
3
ρ, (15.12)
where γ = 1 for radiation and γ = 0 for dust. The solution of Eq. (15.11) after substituting
Eq. (15.12) for P is
ρ(Q) = ρ(Qi) (Qi/Q)
γ+3
, (15.13)
where Qi
is value of Q at an arbitrary reference time ti
. Next, substituting Eqs. (15.12) and
(15.13) in Eqs. (15.9) and (15.10), we obtain

. (15.14b)
Equations (15.14) give the time evolution of FRW universe. We consider the solution
of Eqs. (15.14) in sec. 15.3.3. Before that now we draw some useful information from
Eqs. (15.14) [12]. As Q is the scale factor Eq. (15.14b) gives the deceleration of the universal
expansion and is independent of the value of k. For k = −1 Q˙
is always greater than zero.
Hence, for the negatively curved universe (k = −1) the universe expands forever. For the
flat universe (k = 0) we have Q˙ → 0 only when Q → ∞. So, the universe expands eternally.
For the spherically closed universe (k = 1) Q˙ will become zero at one stage and the universe
will start collapsing.
15.3.2 Big-Bang Model
Friedmann showed in 1922 that the equations of general relativity allow an expanding
solution that starts from a singularity. George Antonovich Gamow and his collaborators
Ralph Asher Alpher and Robert Herman proposed the Big-Bang model of the universe to
account for the abundances of the elements. They proposed that the early universe was once
very hot and dense so as to allow for the nucleosynthetic processing of hydrogen. There after
it has expanded and cooled to its present state [13,14].
The observation of 3 K background radiation and the relative abundance of elements as
predicted by the Big-Bang model confirmed that this model is the most suitable model to
describe our universe.
Though the Big-Bang theory described the early universe fairly well, it could not explain
two important facts of the present universe. It was not able to explain the homogeneous
and isotropic nature of the universe over astronomically large distances and also it could
not explain how the structures like the galaxies, stars and planets were formed. Also, the
standard Big-Bang theory leads to the horizon and flatness problems [15].
15.3.3 Theory of Cosmic Inflation
To overcome the problems faced by the classical Big-Bang theory Alexei Alexandrovich
Starobinsky [16], Alan Harvey Guth [17] and Andrei Dmitriyevich Linde [18,19] developed
a theory of cosmic inflation. Inflation, defined as a period of accelerating expansion in334 Some Other Advanced Topics
the early universe, is now considered as a reasonable explanation for many cosmological
problems. Cosmic inflation is based on the hypothesis that the early universe underwent an
extremely rapid expansion. It explains successfully how quantum mechanical fluctuations
of the vacuum starting about 10−36 seconds after the Big-Bang could have given rise to the
large-scale structure of the universe we observe today. The simplest possible inflationary
cosmological model is based on the concept of the spontaneous birth from nothing of an
empty closed universe via quantum tunnelling [17,20].
Now, consider Eq. (15.14a). As k = 1 for a closed universe and the equation of state for
vacuum is P = −ρvac the Einstein Eq. (15.9) with the cosmological term Λ = 8πGρvac gives
Q˙ 2 +
￾
1 − (Λ/3)Q
2

= 0. (15.15)
If ρ(Q) is constant or slowly varying then the universe expands exponentially as given by
the solution of Eq. (15.15)
Q(t) = Q0 cosh (t/Q0), Q0 =
p
3/Λ. (15.16)
This is the Guth’s inflationary epoch in which the universe expands rapidly when the
universe is about 10−34 sec for a period of 10−30 sec. In that short duration the universe
expands by a factor of roughly 1050 [12].
Inflation in the early universe is now accepted as addressing many cosmological problems.
For inflation to occur initially the universe must contain some matter in highly excited state.
Inflation theory does not explain why the matter was in such an excited state. Two theories
trying to address the pre-inflationary initial conditions are: (i) the chaotic inflation theory
proposed by Linde [18,19] and (ii) quantum cosmology. According to chaotic inflation the
universe starts-off in a completely random state. Due to the random nature of the state there
may be regions of matter more energetic than other and hence inflation could produce the
present universe.
The possibility of the creation of the universe from nothing, where nothing means the
absence of classical space and time, led to two important proposals for such boundary con￾ditions. The first is the no-boundary proposal of James Burkett Hartle and Stephen William
Hawking path integral method [21] and the second is the tunnelling proposal advocated by
Alexander Vilenkin [22] using canonical quantization method.
15.3.4 Wheeler-De Witt Equation
Quantum cosmology depends on the calculation of the quantum state of the universe as
a whole. Such a quantum state must be represented by a wave function. Using this wave
function one hopes to make predictions about the outcome of comological observations.
Using a combination of path integral and canonical methods an equation analogous to the
Schr¨odinger equation called the Wheeler-De Witt (WD) equation was derived [23,24].

where the metric and scalar field φ are considered to be homogeneous and isotropic and Q(t)
is the scale factor. Due to these constraints we have only two degrees of freedom Q(t) and
φ(t). For the nonzero tunnelling probability of the formation of the universe the universQuantum Cosmology 335
must be closed (k = 1). Hence, for FRW universe Eq. (15.7) gives the metric tensor

the superspace is reduced to a two-dimensional manifold called mini-superspace.

The Euclidean region behaves like a classically forbidden region with its wave function being

Q = 0 (nothing – no classical space-time) through the classically forbidden region into the
classically allowed region. The region Q ≥ QB is the classically allowed region of the FRW
metric universe. Hence, Q = 0 is separated from the classically allowed region by a potential

15.3.5 Conceptual Problems in Quantum Cosmology
Quantum cosmology is more speculative as we do not have a fully self-consistent theory of
quantum gravity. Quantum cosmology gives the wave function of the universe which cannot
be interpretted physically. ψ depends only on metric variable Q and the scalar potential
φ. It is independent of time. Therefore, time itself has to be defined interms of Q and φ.
No such definition for time has been found yet. The second serious problem is that the
probability defined using ψ is not positive definite as in the case of Klein–Gordon equation.
These problems are overcome only by the semiclassical approximations. Otherwise time and
probability cannot be defined and consequently no measurement can be done at all. So, an
observational test of quantum cosmology has to be developed to understand the complete
picture of the universe. The review article [26] can be referred for more information on
conceptual problems in quantum gravity and quantum cosmology.
15.4 Quantum Zeno Effect
The effect of a measurement on a quantum state is usually described by the projection
postulate of von Neumann and Gerhart L¨uders. According to this, depending on the result
of a measurement, the wave function of the system is projected onto the eigenspaces of
the observable. This is also called collapse of the wave function in a measurement. Before
a measurement, the wave function is a superposition of all states − an arbitrary quantum
state. At the time of measurement it collapses into a particular state. Baidyanaith Misra and
Ennackal Chandy George Sudarshan raised the question: What would happen if we observe
the system all the time? With some reasonable assumptions, they have investigated the338 Some Other Advanced Topics
influence of rapidly repeating measurements at times ∆t apart on a system [27]. They
found a slow down of time development of the system in the limit ∆t → 0, called the
quantum Zeno paradox as it is reminiscent of Zeno’s arrow paradox . The quantum Zeno
effect refers to a freezing of a quantum state. Even a system with high energy and highly
unstable will remain in the same initial state, as long as it is observed, like an unmoved
rabbit when a bright light is shined on its eyes.
Zeno of Elea (490 BC–425 BC) was a pre-Socretic Greek philosopher of southern Italy.
He formulated many paradoxes to show that all is one. His most famous paradoxes are
Achilles (the legendary Greek warrior) and the tortoise and the arrow paradox. In a race,
the quickest runner cannot overtake the slowest, because the pursuer must first reach the
point whence the pursued started (ahead), so that the slower must always have a lead. If
a tortoise will be allowed to start from a point ahead of Achilles then the tortoise when
running will not be overtaken by Achilles. To overtake the tortoise, Achilles first must reach
the point from which the tortoise started. Then by that time the tortoise will have moved
a distance. That is, the tortoise must always be some distance ahead of Achilles. The arrow
paradox is that if everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which
is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any time, the flying arrow is thus
motionless. Consider an arrow in motion. Suppose we divide the time into a number of
indivisible instants. Then at any given instant if we see the arrow it has an exact position.
It is thus not moving. Therefore, if we continuously observe the arrow then it is at rest all
the time.
15.4.1 Theoretical Consideration
Consider a quantum system Q with its states belonging to the Hilbert space H. The evolu￾tion of it is described by the unitary operator U(t) = e−iHt/~
, where H is the Hamiltonian.
Let E be a projection operator such that EHE = HE, where HE is the subspace spanned
by its eigenstates. The initial density matrix ρ(0) of Q belongs to HE. For an undisturbed
evolution at time T
ρ(T) = U(T)ρ(0)U
†
(T). (15.41)
The probability P(T) for Q to be in HE at T is
P(T) = Tr 
U(T)ρ(0)U
†
(T)E

. (15.42)
P(T) is called survival probability and is < 1.
By definition
ρ(0) = Eρ(0)E , Tr[ρ(0)E] = 1 . (15.43)
When a measurement is made at t then ρ(t) becomes
ρ(t) = EU(t)ρ(0)U
†
(t)E . (15.44)
Now,
P(T) = Tr 
U(t)ρ(0)U
†
(t)E

. (15.45)
Suppose we carry out a series of observations at tn = nT /N, n = 1, 2,. . ., N. After N
measurements the state of Q is given by
ρ
(N)
(T) = VN (T)ρ(0)V
†
N (T), VN (T) = [EU(T /N)E]

(15.46)
and
P

(T) = Tr h

†
N (T)

. (15.47)Quantum Zeno Effect 339
Define
ν(T) = lim
N→∞
VN (T). (15.48)
Then in the limit of N → ∞ (continuous observation)
ρ˙f (T) = ν(T)ρ(0)ν

and
Pf (T) = lim
N→∞
P
(N)
(T) = Tr 
ν(T)ρ(0)ν
†
(T)

. (15.50)
Misra and Sudarshan assumed that limt→0 ν(t) = E and proved that ν(T) exists for all real
T and ν
†
(T) = ν(−T) so that ν
†ν = E. Then by Eq. (15.43)
ρf (T) = Tr 
ρ(0)ν
†
ν

= Tr [ρ(0)E] = 1 . (15.51)
The significant implication is that if the system is continuously observed then it will
never undergo a transition to H − HE. In other words, continuous observation of a time￾independent projection operator prevents a change of state. Thus, an unstable quantum
state that is observed continuously is never found to decay or a watched pot never boils [28]
or a watched clock does not move. This is the quantum Zeno paradox . By repeating the
same measurement considerably large number of times in a finite time the system can be
arrested in its initial state. The paradoxial point1
is that the system is found to have its
decay influenced by the presence of a measuring device. The Zeno paradox differs from the
two other famous paradoxes: the Schr¨odinger cat and the EPR. Those two are paradoxes
of interpretation. The Zeno paradox is a prediction and can be tested.
15.4.2 Quantum Zeno Effect in a Neutron Spin System
Consider the evolution of the neutron spin subjected to a magnetic field [30]. The interaction
of a neutron with a static field B is given by H = µBσ1, where µ is the magnetic moment
of the neutron and σi
, i = 1, 2, 3 are the Pauli matrices. Denote the spin states of neutron
along the z-axis as | ↑i and | ↓i. Assume the initial state of neutron as ρ(0) = ρ↑↑ = | ↑ih↑ |.
ρ

is then obtained as [30]

The significant effect of frequent observations is to freeze the system in its initial state,
by delaying (for N ≥ 2) and hindering (for N → ∞) transitions to other states. What
is the essence of the quantum Zeno effect? The essential point is that when the number

In the words of John Gribbin [29]: If, as quantum theory suggests, the world only exists because it is
being observed, then it is also true that the world only changes because it is not being observed all the time .340 Some Other Advanced Topics

of measurements is finite the decay rate is slowed and we have the quantum Zeno effect.
When the number of measurements becomes infinite the transition is completely frozen and
the result is the quantum Zeno paradox . The quantum Zeno effect was shown theoretically
about three decades ago. However, interest on it was renewed by the idea of Cook [31] and
its subsequent experimental verification.
15.4.3 Experimental Verification
Richard J. Cook [31] proposed an experiment on a trapped ion to test the quantum Zeno
effect on induced transitions. Suppose the ion has three levels as shown in Fig. 15.1. Level-1
is the ground state. Level-2 is an excited metastable state. Cook’s suggestion was to drive
1 → 2 transition with a π-pulse (a square-pulse of duration T = π/Ω) while simultaneously
applying a sequence of short measurement pulses. Suppose the ion is in level-1 at time t = 0.
The π-pulse is applied at t = nT /N = nπ/(NΩ), where n = 1, 2, . . . , N.
In the rotating wave approximation the evolution equations for the density matrix ρij ,
i, j = 1, 2 are given by
ρ˙11 =
1
2
iΩ (ρ21 − ρ12), ρ˙12 =
1
2
iΩ (ρ22 − ρ11), (15.55a)
ρ˙22 =
1
2
iΩ (ρ12 − ρ21). (15.55b)
Define
R1 = ρ12 + ρ21, R2 = i (ρ12 − ρ21), R3 = ρ22 − ρ11 = P2 − P1 (15.56)
with P1 + P2 = 1. In terms of R = (R1, R2, R3) and Ω = (Ω, 0, 0) Eqs. (15.55) become
R˙ = Ω × R. At t = 0 we have R = (0, 0, −1). The applied pulse induces transition from
level 1 to 3. Subsequently, a spontaneous emission of a photon happens. The measurement
pulse projects the system into level-1 or level-2. The measurement kills the terms ρ12 and
ρ21 and leave ρ11 and ρ22 as such. Now, R becomes

Setting R2 = 0 gives R = [0, 0, − cos(π/N)]. At t = π/(NΩ), R is the same at t = 0,
however, the magnitude of it is reduced by a factor of cos(π/N). After the first measurement,

P2(T) is the occupation probability of level-2 with the transitions 1 → 2 → 1 and so on.
Note that P2 given by Eq. (15.63) is not the one given by Eq. (15.61).
Itano and his coworkers [33] did an experiment with 9Be+, similar to the one proposed
by Cook [31]. The time development was given by a π-pulse tuned to the 1 − 2 transition
frequency. A π-pulse (a radio frequency (RF) pulse) transformed the initial state |1i into |2i
at the end of the pulse, provided there was no measurement. The population of lower level
was measured nonselectively and also without recording the results in rapid succession by
the fluorescence induced by very short pulses of laser which coupled level-1 with the level-3.
The population at time T was measured by a final pulse and recorded. The experimental
result was found to be in good agreement with prediction of the quantum Zeno effect. The
P2 calculated for N = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 are 0.995, 0.5, 0.335, 0.194, 0.103, 0.013, respectively.
These values are in agreement with (15.63).
15.4.4 Further Development on Zeno Effect
The quantum Zeno effect has been shown theoretically for two states wave functions like
spin particles [34], right- and left-isomers [35], two-state model of the localized Born–
Oppenheimer states [36], multi-level system [37], a system of particles with spin-1/2 in￾teracting with a magnetic field [38], quantum version of an inverted pendulum [39], neutron
spin [40], Raman scattering [40] and models of trapped ions [41]. Experimental verification of
quantum Zeno effect has been done with the system of 172Yb+ ion [42] and 171Yb+ ion [43],
in an optical pumping [44], systems with forced Rabi oscillations between discrete atomic
levels [33] and spontaneously decaying systems [45]. Stochastic quantum Zeno [46] and
quantum Zeno effect in the strong measurement regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics
[47] were reported. It was predicted that there are regimes in which repeated measurements
can accelerate transitions [48–53] and this phenomenon was found experimentally [45] as
well. This effect is known as anti-Zeno effect or anti-Zeno paradox or inverse Zeno effect.342 Some Other Advanced Topics

FIGURE 15.2
A two-level system.
Specifically, the quantum Zeno and anti-Zeno paradoxes arise due to infinitely frequent
measurements of time-independent and time-dependent projection operators, respectively.
It is shown that the transition from coherent to incoherent fluorescence energy transfer can
be regarded as a demonstration of quantum Zeno or anti-Zeno effect [54].
Some applications of quantum Zeno effect are suggested, Numerical simulation of a new
method of quantum Zeno tomography in which a Mach–Zehnder interferometer is adopted
to measure transmissivity of gray samples was considered [55]. In contrast to standard
tomography, considerable reduction of false reproduced points is demonstrated. A possible
construction of photon-phonon interferometer is suggested, where interference between an
optical mode in a cavity and one-dimensional vibration phonon mode of an ion trapped
in the same cavity takes place [56]. Its inner degrees of freedom are removed with the
application of Zeno effect by freezing the ion in its initial state. The effect has explained
the suppression of the conversion decay of an isomer of uranium-235 in the lattice of silver
[57].
The occurrence of quantum Zeno effect does not depend on whether information is taken
from the measurements or not. Therefore, decoherence processes, such as optical pumping
and coupling to stochastic external fields can result in the quantum Zeno effect. This also
points out that there exists a classical counterpart. Quantum Zeno effect has been found in
wave or oscillatory systems [58] and optical fibers [59]. The quantum Zeno effect is found
to vanish at all orders in ~, when ~ → 0. This implies that it is a quantum phenomenon
without a classical analog [60].
Quantum Zeno effect is important in understanding quantum theory of measurement
and is in fact a vital tool in quantum computing. Due to decoherence, storing a quantum
state for a long time is impossible. Quantum Zeno effect may be utilized to store a quantum
state as long as we wish. For a detailed discussion on mathematical and physical aspects of
Zeno dynamics one may refer to ref. [61].
15.4.5 Anti-Zeno Effect
Alfred Luis demonstrated the anti-Zeno effect in a two-level system (Fig. 15.2) with the
Hamiltonian [62]
H = ~∆|0ih0| +
~Ω
2
(|0ih1| + |1ih0|). (15.64)
Here ∆ is the detuning and Ω is the coupling constant of the term stimulating the level
transitions (refer Fig. 15.2). H given by Eq. (15.64) can represent a two-level atomic system
subjected to a classical monochromatic electromagnetic wave with frequency ω. If ω0 is the
resonant frequency of the atom then ∆ = ω − ω0.Quantum Teleportation 343
Assume that the state of the system at t = 0 is |1i. Then P(t), the probability for the
system to be in the state |1i is
P(t) = 1 −

. (15.65)
Because P(t) is rapidly oscillating we consider the time average of P(t) over a time interval
T with √
Ω2 + ∆2 T  1 and denote it as P¯. We obtain
P¯ =

. (15.66)
When ∆  Ω we have P¯ ≈ 1 and the system is always close to |1i.
Suppose measurement is performed at t = nτ . What is the probability p(n) for observing
the system in the initial state (|1i) in all the first n measurements? It is given by p(n) =
(P(τ ))n

p(n) is independent of ∆. In the limit of τ → 0, we have p(n) ≈ 1 and it refers to the Zeno
effect and is the case for t  1/(Ω2
τ ). If the observations are made with finite τ during a
period of time exceeding the short-time condition, that is the long-time regime t  1/(Ω2
τ )
then p(n) ≈ 0 and |1i → |0i will occur with certainty. This is the anti-Zeno effect.
15.5 Quantum Teleportation
Classically, transport of an object is to transport all the particles of it. An object to be
teleported can be characterized by its properties. These properties can be determined by
measurement in classical physics. Scanned information is useful for reconstructing the object
and notably the original parts of the object are not needed. But a fundamental question is
what is the case if an object is a quantum state? What does happen to the quantum properties
of the system, that are not measurable with desired accuracy due to Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle?
Reconstructing the quantum state of a system on another system of the same type at
a distant place is termed as quantum teleportation. The point is that the quantum state of
the system to be teleported is unknown and in fact we cannot find it. Therefore, quantum
teleportation is the transmission and reconstruction of an unknown quantum state of a
system over arbitrary distances. Essentially, in quantum teleportation the system is not
to be teleported but only its state is to be teleported to another system of same kind. In
quantum teleportation the original state is destroyed and an exact copy of the quantum
state is produced. In the case of fax copy, the original is preserved and only a partial
copy is made. The quantum teleportation was first discussed by Yakir Aharonov and David
Z. Albert using the method of nonlocal measurements [63].
15.5.1 A Three Stage Scheme
Charles H. Bennett and his co-workers [64] have pointed out that the quantum state of a
particle can be transferred to another particle provided one does not get any information
about the state during the course of transportation. The above can be realized by using
entanglement. The scheme of Bennett et al consists of essentially three stages:344 Some Other Advanced Topics
1. An EPR source of entangled particles is prepared. Sender and receiver share each
particle from a pair emitted by the source.
2. Sender performs a Bell-operator measurement on his EPR and the teleportation￾target particles.
3. Sender transmits the result of the measurement to the receiver through a classical
channel. Then the receiver performs a suitable unitary operation on the EPR
particle.
Let us describe the above three stages scheme in detail. Suppose Alice (sender) has two
two-level particles, say, particle-1 and particle-2. A two-level quantum system is a qubit.
Bob (receiver) who is at a distant location has a particle, say, particle-3. The two states of a
particle are labelled as |0i and |1i. The superposition state is |ψi = a|0i+b|1i, |a|
2+|b|
2 = 1.
Alice wants Bob, to have the particle-3 with the state of the particle-1. Since properties
of quantum systems cannot be fully obtained by measurements Alice is unable to provide
required information of the particle-1 to Bob by carrying out the measurements on it.
The joint state of particles 2 and 3 is, for example,
|ψiAB =
1
√
2

|0iA|0iB + |1iA|1iB

. (15.68)
This state is entangled because it is not possible to write it as a product of the individual
states, like |00i. |ψiAB gives no information about the individual particles but points out
that the particles 2 and 3 are in same states. What is the feature of the above entangled
state? A measurement on, say, particle-2 gives the state of the particle-3 and vice-versa.
Suppose the state of the particle-1 is labelled as |φi = a|0i + b|1i with the unknown a
and b: |φi is to be teleported to Bob. Now, the total state of the three particles is
|φiAB := |φi|ψiAB =

called the Bell basis. In the above |01i indicates that particle-1 is in the state |0i while the
particle-2 is in |1i. Similar meaning for |00i, |10i and |11i. The protocol then proceeds as
follows:
1. Alice will carry out projection measurements on her particles. She will get any
one of the four Bell states randomly with equal probability.Quantum Teleportation 345
2. Suppose the state got by Alice is |ψ
+i. Then in the state |φiAB the three particles
collapse into the state
|φiAB = |ψ
+i[a|1i + b|0i] , (15.71)
where a|1i+b|0i represents the state of the particle-3 (of Bob). Now, Alice wants
to convey this result to Bob by a classical channel, for example, over the phone.
She informs the difference in the state of the particles 2 and 3.
3. What does Bob do now? The state |ψ
+i indicates that (refer to Eq. (15.70c))
the states of the particles 1 and 2 are orthogonal (opposite). But the states of
particles 2 and 3 are prepared as in Eq. (15.68) which means their states are
the same. The state of the particle-2 is hence opposite to 1 but the same as 3.
This is true only if particles 1 and 3 are orthogonal. The states of them are thus
opposite. Since the state of particle-1 is |φi = a|0i + b|1i the state of particle-3 is
a|1i + b|0i. Therefore, Bob has to do the NOT operation that changes the state
of particle-3 into a|0i + b|1i. This completes the protocol.
What has to be done if Alice got some other Bell state instead of |ψ
+i?
15.5.2 Features of the Three Stage Scheme
Some of the features of the above teleportation scheme are summarized as follows:
1. During the Bell-state measurement particle-1 is set entangled with particle-2.
Hence, particle-1 lost its identity. The state |φi on Alice’s side during teleportation
is destroyed.
2. Alice need not know the location of Bob.
3. The initial state of particle-1 is unknown to anyone and even undefined at the
time of measurement.
4. The measurements of Alice and the operations of Bob are local.
5. Bob’s operations are independent of the state of the particle-1 state.
6. The classical communication used is local.
7. The measurement does not provide information of the particles involved. Thus,
no damage to the no-cloning theorem of Wooters and Zuerk [65].
8. According to the theory of relativity, information transfer faster than light is not
possible. Quantum teleportation does not take place faster than light, because
the communication channel used is classical.
Motivated by the proposal of Bennett and his coworkers various groups have initiated
investigation on experimental quantum teleportation. Bouwmeester et al [66] reported the
first experimental quantum teleportation. They used pairs of polarization entangled photons
produced through pulsed down-conversion. Two photon interferometric method is employed
to transfer the state of one photon onto another. Furasawa et al [67] demonstrated telepor￾tation using the protocol in ref. [68] with squeezed state entanglement. The experiment of
Boschi et al [69] involved a quantum optical implementation.
The teleportation schemes could be used to set up links between quantum computers.
Research on quantum teleportation also opens new types of experiments and investigation
on the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. It can be used to transmit information desirably
in a noisy environment. Quantum teleportation can be used to construct quantum gates.
As the particle is not sent, a quantum teleportation is a novel scheme of secure transfer of
information. For more details on teleportation one may refer to refs. [63–71].346 Some Other Advanced Topics

15.6 Quantum Games
Game theory is referred to as the study of decision making in conflict situation. It has ap￾plications in military warfare, anthropology, social psychology, economics, politics, business
and philosophy [72–75]. Interest has been paid on extending classical game theory to the
quantum domain to study the problems of quantum computation, information and commu￾nication. Quantum game theory began with the seminal work of David A. Meyer (1999). It
deals with classical games in the realm of quantum mechanics. Considerable progress has
been made in this area. Several protocols have been proposed and certain classical games
have been extended to the quantum case. The interesting point is that quantum superpo￾sition and entanglement between the states of the players ensure the players to outperform
the classical moves through quantum mechanical strategies.
15.6.1 Classical Game
In classical game theory, a game essentially consists of
1. a set of players,
2. a set of strategies dictating the actions of players and
3. a payoff function specifying the reward for a set of strategy choices. The payoff
to a player is a numerical value.
In a game theory the goal of a player is to optimize his payoff. In a game, a dominant
strategy is that the player has to do at least as well as any other competing strategy.
The Nash equilibrium is the most important among the possible equilibria [74,76]. It is the
combination of strategies with which none of the players can improve his/her payoff by a
unilateral change of strategy. A Pareto optimal outcome is that from which no player is
able to obtain a higher profit without reducing the utility of another.Quantum Games 347
15.6.2 Quantum Game
A quantum system manipulated by players, where the usefulness of the possible moves are
defined, can be thought of as a quantum game [76–78]. A two player game Γ = (H, P, PA, PB)
is specified by
1. the Hilbert space H of the system,
2. the initial state P ∈ P(H), with P(H) being the state space,
3. P = PA ⊗ PB describing the players, say Alice (A) and Bob (B) and
4. initial strategies PA and PB.
PA and PB specify the payoff or utility for the players. Quantum tactics SA and SB
are linear quantum operations mapping the state space on itself and are positive trace￾preserving. A change of strategy of the players is represented by a linear map. Schematically,
we have
P
SA,SB
−−−−−→ σ ⇒ (PA, PB). (15.75)
The generalization of the above for the N players is straight-forward. A most notable feature
of quantum game theory is that effects not possible in the classical case can occur due
to quantum entanglement and interference. Quantum game theory differs from classical
game theory by using superposed initial states, quantum entanglement of initial states and
superposition of strategies to be used in the initial states. Quantum game approach has
been applied to typical classical games such as coin tossing [76,79], the prisoners’ dilemma
[80–84], the Monty Hall problem [85,86], the battle of the sexes [87,88], rock-scissors-paper
[89] and others [90–92].
15.6.3 Parrondo’s Games
Juan Manuel Rodr´ıguez Parrondo has discovered an apparent and fascinating paradox called
Parrondo paradox in game theory. In it, two games when played individually are losing can
be combined to yield a winning game [93–96]. That is, Parrondo paradox results when a
losing game is played by disturbing the winning feedback by a second losing game so that
the first losing game becomes a winning.
15.6.3.1 Classical Games
Classical Parrondo’s games cast in the form of gambling games by utilizing a set of biased
coins. However, here we first illustrate the paradox with a deterministic game [97] and then
that of Parrondo. Suppose the current capital of a player is M (even) dollars.
Game A:
The player wins 1 dollar if M is even, otherwise loses 3 dollars.
Game B:
The player wins 1 dollar if M is odd, otherwise loses 3 dollars.
Playing only the game A or B repeatedly leads to a steady loss of 1 dollar per play. What
will happen if these two games are played alternately? Playing ABAB . . . gives a steady win
of 1 dollar per play: a combination of two losing games results in a winning game. So,
Parrondo’s paradox seems to be conveying that playing the sequence (AB)m is better than
AmB
m. What is the outcome of the game if we replace the loss of 3 dollars by the loss of 1
dollar and the sequence ABAB . . . is followed?
The original games of Parrondo is capital-dependent (CD) requiring feedback loops [96].348 Some Other Advanced Topics
TABLE 15.2

Win Loss 3
Win Win 4
Parrondo, Gregory P. Harmer and Derek Abbott [95] proposed a capital-independent but
history-dependent (HD) game with feed-forward loops. The construction of the games is
the following.
Game A:
It involves tossing a weighted coin 1 with probability pw = 0.5 − , 0 <   1 for winning
and pl = 1 − pw for losing.
Game B:
CD and HD types of games differ. There are two biased coins (coins 2 and 3) in the CD
game and p2w = 0.1 −  and p3w = 0.75 − . Coin 2 or 3 is tossed depending on the capital
M at the instant and hence the name CD game. Coin 2 is tossed if M is a multiple of 3,
otherwise coin 3. Note that, on the average, coin 3 will be played more frequently than coin
2. However, coin 2 outweighs coin 3 because of its poor winning probability. As a result,
game B is overall a losing game.
In an HD game 3 coins are used. One of them is tossed based on the outcome of the
previous game. This is illustrated in table 15.2. What are the probabilities of the three coins?
Evidently, coin 3 is tossed more often than the other coins, and hence this is a losing game.
In the Parrondo’s games, both A and B are losing games for small positive values of .
However, simulation of the games have predicted that switching between the losing games,
e.g., playing two times A, two times B, two times A, and so on result in winning. That is,
a player can play the two losing games A and B in such an order to realize a winning ex￾pectation. For detailed results see refs. [95–98]. Promising application areas for Parrondo’s
paradox are in biogenesis spin systems, stochastic signal processing, economics and socio￾logical modelling [98].
15.6.3.2 Quantum Version of Parrondo’s Games
We present the quantum version of the HD Parrondo’s games formulated by Flitney, Ng
and Abbott [99] A quantum version CD Parrondo’s games is reported in ref.[100]. In clas￾sical gambling games there is a random element. It is replaced by a superposition of all
the possible results in quantum games. We can realize new behaviour by this. The coin
tossing game can be quantized by an SU(2) operation on a qubit. A physical system may
be a collection of polarized photons with |0i and |1i representing horizontal and vertical
polarizations, respectively.
An arbitrary SU(2) operation on a qubit is expressed as
Ab(θ, γ, δ) = Pb(γ)Rb(θ)Pb(δ)
=

e
−i(γ+δ)/2
cos θ −e

sin θ e


, (15.76)Quantum Games 349
where θ ∈ [−π, π] and γ, δ ∈ [0, 2π]. This is the quantum analogue of the game A−a
single toss of a biased coin. Game B consists of four SU(2) operations, each of the form of
Eq. (15.76):
Bb =


A(φ1, α1, β1) 0 0 0
0 A(φ2, α2, β2) 0 0
0 0 A(φ3, α3, β3) 0
0 0 0 A(φ4, α4, β4)

 . (15.77)
This acts on the state |ψ(t−2)i⊗|ψ(t−1)i⊗|ii, where |ψ(t−1)i and |ψ(t−2)i represent the
results of the two previous games. |ii is the qubit’s initial state. We write Bb|q1q2q3i = |q1q2bi,
where qi ∈ {0, 1} and b is the output of the game B. The result of n successive games of B
is found by
|ψf i =

state
|ψii =

√

(|00 . . . 0i + |11 . . . 1i) . (15.80)
In this case interference effects enhance or reduce the success of the player. The addition
of nonzero phases in the operators Ab and Bb alter this interference. Let the payoff for a |1i
state be 1 and for a |0i state be −1. Since quantum mechanics is a probabilistic theory

The maximum payoff is for β1 = β4 = −2δ and β2 = β3 = π−2δ. The result is minimum for
β1 = β4 = π − 2δ and β2 = β3 = −2δ. Observe that the values of φi
’s are irrelevant. h$AABi
varies between −0.812 + 0.03 and 0.812 + 0.24. The classical payoff is 1/60 − 28/15. The

respectively. For more results see ref. [99].350 Some Other Advanced Topics

15.6.4 Prisoners’ Dilemma
The prisoners’ dilemma (PD) is an another famous classical game extended into quantum
domain [80]. The Parrondo’s games are played by a single player whereas PD game is played
by two players. It is a nonzero sum game. The two players are not in opposition to each
other. They may benefit from mutual cooperation.
15.6.4.1 A Classical Game
In the classical version of the PD game, the two players, say, Alice and Bob, decide inde￾pendently to choose defect (strategy D) or cooperate (strategy C). Depending on their own
decision they receive a certain payoff as in table 15.3.
There exists a dominant strategy, that of always defecting, because it gives a better payoff
when if the other player cooperates (5 instead of 3) or if the other player defects (1 instead of
3). If both players have a dominant strategy then this combination is the Nash equilibrium.
The Nash equilibrium outcome {D,D} is not a good one for the players. However, since
both the players would receive a payoff of 3 if they cooperate, the Pareto optimal results.
Here no player will be able to improve his/her payoff by unilaterally changing own strategy.
This is the dilemma.
15.6.4.2 A Quantum PD Game
Does a quantum version of the PD game have a different solution? A quantum model of
the PD is proposed by Eisert et al [80]. In this model the two players escape the dilemma
by carrying out quantum strategies. The quantum version is depicted in Fig. 15.3. To get
nonclassical results entanglement between the players’ moves is created. Initial state of theQuantum Games 351
qubits is |ψii = |Ci|Ci = |CCi. The final state is
|ψf i = Jb†

UbA ⊗ UbB

Jb|ψii, (15.83)
where Jb is an operator entangling the qubits of the players. Strategic moves are associated
with UbA (Alice) and UbB (Bob). A disentangling gate Jb†
is used for a measurement on the
final state. The expectation value of payoff of Alice is
h$Ai = PCC|hψf |CCi|2 + PCD|hψf |CDi|2
+PDC|hψf |DCi|2 + PDD|hψf |DDi|2
, (15.84)
where Pij , i, j ∈ {C, D} is the payoff for Alice with the game outcome ij. Interchanging i
and j in Pij in Eq. (15.84) gives the payoff of Bob. We note that expected payoff of Alice
depends on UbA and also on Bob’s choice UbB. If the players play with classical strategies
the quantum game gives nothing surprise. However, if they utilize quantum strategies the
entanglement opens the opportunity for their moves to interact in ways which have no
classical analogue.
Suppose we have quantum strategies of the form
Ub(θ, φ) = 
e
iφ
cos(θ/2) i sin(θ/2)
i sin(θ/2) e−iφ
cos(θ/2) 
, (15.85)
where θ ∈ [0, π], φ ∈ [0, π/2] and consider the entangling operator in the form
Jb = exp 
iγDb ⊗ D/ b 2

, γ ∈ [0, π/2] . (15.86)
The strategy that always cooperate is Cb = Ub(0) = Ib and always defect strategy is Db =
Ub(π) = Fb. Against a classical Alice playing with Ub(θ), a quantum Bob can play Eisert’s
miracle move [80]
Mc = Ub(π/2, π/2) = i
√
2

1 1
1 −1

(15.87)
that gives h$Bi = 3+ 2 sin θ for Bob and only h$Ai = (1−sin θ)/2. The dilemma is removed.
It has been demonstrated that there was a new Nash equilibrium producing a payoff of 3
to both the players and is Pareto optimal. In ref.[101] a quantum PD with Eisert et al’s
scheme was achieved on a two qubit NMR computer with various degrees of entanglement
from a classical to a maximally entangled quantum game. Good agreement between theory
and experiment was obtained.
Solved Problem 3:
In the quantum version of prisoners’ dilemma game what is the state of the game after
passing the state |CCi through the gate Jˆ? What are the explicit expressions of both
players’ payoff?
We obtain
|ψii = Jˆ|CCi = cos(γ/2)|CCi + i sin(γ/2)|DDi. (15.88)
For the case of payoff in table 9.3, we obtain
$A = 3PCC + 1PDD + 0PCD + 5PDC, (15.89a)
$B = 3PCC + 1PDD + 5PCD + 0PDC. (15.89b)
The behaviour of prior entanglement shared among the two spatially separated part￾ner can be extended to the relativistic set-up in noninertial frames [102–104]. Quantum

15.6.5 Why are Quantum Games Interesting? What are the Possible
Uses of Quantum Games?
There are several reasons for interest on quantum games [80]. Some of them are listed
below.
1. Classical game theory has applications in various fields. Because it is based on
probabilities, there is a fundamental interest in generalizing the theory to quan￾tum probabilities.
2. Most of the applications of game theory in science have been in biology, in par￾ticular the competition and cooperation between species in individual animals.
We believe that survival games are played on the molecular level, where quantum
mechanics is the ruler.
3. Whenever a player conveys his/her decision to the other player he/she commu￾nicates information. Thus, there exists a link between game theory and quantum
communication.
4. Eavesdropping in quantum communication and quantum cloning can be conceived
in a strategic game between two or more players.
5. Quantum mechanics may be useful to certain specially designed games such as
PQ penny flip [76] and may assure fairness in remote gambling.
6. Quantum games provide a deeper insight into quantum complexity particularly
in the design of quantum algorithms.
15.7 Quantum Pseudo-Telepathy Games
The main criticism of Einstein on quantum mechanics was that it is not local and not
realistic. According to his conviction, a measurement at some location A could not have
any effect at some other location B in a time faster than that required by light to travel
from A to B. Also, he felt that any measurement of a system must only be real elements of
reality that were already present in the system being measured. But the presence of quantum
entanglement and Heisenberg uncertainty relations make quantum mechanics nonlocal and
contradict Einstein realism. Bell’s theorem [105] and subsequent experiments done [106–108]
concluded that physical world is not local realistic. The theoretical and experiment study
of pseudo-telepathy provides a convinsing demonstration that the physical world cannot
be local realistic. Quantum pseudo-telepathy games [109–117] are considered as a form of
quantum games. When a game has no winning strategies for classical players but if the
sharing of entanglement gives a winning strategy certainly then it is a quantum pseudo￾telepathy class of game.
1. Magic Square Game
Consider the so-called magic square game. A magic square consists of 3×3 array of cells
as shown in Fig. 15.4a. Each cell can be assigned a value either 1 or −1. The product of the
numbers in each row is to be 1 while the product of numbers in each column is to be −1.
In the magic square shown in Fig. 15.4b, the product of the numbers in the filled rows and
columns satisfy the above conditions. What about the third row and column? Assigning
either 1 or −1 does not satisfy the requirement on the product. The conclusion is the magic
square does not exist.Quantum Pseudo-Telepathy Games 353

(c) An example of a magic square with first row filled by Alice and the second column filled
by Bob.
Suppose the magic square game is played by two players Alice and Bob. Neither Alice
nor Bob has details of row or column the other has filled and nor they are aware of the
values the other has assigned. If Alice and Bob enter the same number in the cell common to
their row and column and the product of the numbers in row (column) becomes 1 (−1) then
the game is said to be won. Xavier and Yolande each generate a random integer number
from the set {1, 2, 3}. Xavier (Yolande) informs the number to Alice (Bob). If the number
generated by Xavier is 1 then Alice has to fillup the first row with ±1 so that the product
of the numbers in the first row is 1. Similarly, if the number generated by Yolande is 2 then
Bob has to fillup the second column with the numbers ±1 so that the product the numbers
in the column 2 has to be −1. Further, they should assign same number to the intersecting
cell. An example is shown in Fig. 15.4c.
2. Classical Strategy of the Magic Square Game
In the classical strategy, the success rate is not higher than 8/9 [116]. There is no classical
strategy that leads to winning with probability 1. To prove this [118] assume that a classical
strategy of 100% success exists. Denote mrc as the number in the cell designated as rc, where
r and c represent the row and column, respectively. For 100% success we require for the
rows
m11m12m13 = 1, m21m22m23 = 1, m31m32m33 = 1 (15.90a)
and for the three columns
m11m21m31 = −1, m12m22m32 = −1, m13m23m33 = −1 . (15.90b)

3. Quantum Strategy of the Magic Square Game
The magic square game can become certainly winning [119,120] if Alice and Bob share
an entangled quantum state. From Eqs. (15.91) we observe that if mrc commute with
each other, so that the order of occurrence of mrc can be rearranged, then solution does
not exist [118]. Therefore, we look for solutions of Eqs. (15.90) those are noncommuta￾tive. In other words, it is desired to determine operators mrc satisfying (15.90). As the
numbers in the cells are real numbers ±1 the operators mrc have to be Hermitian and
their eigenvalues are ±1. In each row the operators have to commute with each other
and similarly in each column. Consequently, the associated observables can be jointly
measured.
A possible observables in the cells of the magic square game are presented in Fig. 15.5,
where σx, σy and σz are Pauli spin operators and I is the identity operator. The operators
in each row are mutually commuting with others and their product becomes I. Similarly,
the operators in each column are mutually commuting and their product is −I. Further,
the operators have eigenvalues +1 and −1. These satisfy the rules of the game. As the
operators satisfy Eqs. (15.91) the product of the outputs of Alice becomes +1 and that of
Bob becomes −1. Next, we need to check the compatibility condition. That is, both Alice
and Bob should obtain identical output for the cell common to them. For this purpose Alice
and Bob share the product of the two maximally entangled two-qubit Bell states given
by

[ |00iA1B1 + |11iA1B1
] ⊗

] . (15.93)
Based on the row and column are assigned to Alice and Bob, respectively, they perform
measurements on their quantum systems as per the observables specified in the cells in
Fig. 15.5. The outcomes of the measurements supply the values which Alice and Bob have
to assign in their respective row and column with certainly winning.
The topic of pseudo-telepathy games received great interest for several reasons [116].
Classical impossibility and the possibility of the quantum version of these games are easy
to understand. They are capable of providing loophole-free description that the physical
world is not local realistic. Certain other popular pseudo-telepathy games are colouring
games [109,112,121], parity games [108,114,116,122–124], Deutsch–Joszsa games [125–127]
and matching games [116].Quantum Pseudo-Telepathy Games 355

Show that every observables in the magic square of Fig. 15.5 has eigenvalues +1 and −1

That is, λ = ±1. So, the eigenvalues of −σx ⊗ σz are +1, +1, −1 and −1. Therefore, +1
and −1 occur with equal probability 1/2. Similarly, all the observables can be proved to
have the eigenvalues as ±1 with equal probability.
4. Magic Square Game With Entries 0 and 1
There is another version of magic square game where the entries are 0 and 1. The rule
here is that the sum of the entries in row must be even while the sum of the entries in
each column must be odd [116]. Such a square does not exist. In the classical case for 100%
success the requirement is
even = X

mrc =

mrc = odd . (15.97)
The quantum winning strategy for this version of the magic square is presented in [116].

In the computational basis Alice and Bob measure their qubits. The measurement gives two
bits for Alice and another two bits for Bob. These are the first two entries for them. Alice
and Bob identify their third entry applying the conditions that the sum of the entries in
the row must be even and the sum of the entries in the column must be odd, respectively.

Any measurement will collapse the wave function in one of its eigenstates. Therefore, mea￾surement by Alice will give any one of the four states (first two bits) 00, 01, 10 and 11.
Similarly, measurement by Bob will give third and fourth bits. Suppose due to the measure￾ment the wave function becomes |1000i. Alice gets the bits 10 and Bob’s bits are 00. The
requirement is that the Bob must choose a third bit such a way that the sum of the bits of
Alice must be even and Bob must choose his bit such a way that sum of his three bits must
be odd. So, Alice has to add 1 to get 101. Bob choose 1 and make his bits 001. The magic
square after Alice and Bobl filled their respective ro and column is as in Fig. 15.6. As the

in which Alice gets 00 and Bob gets 10. By adding 0 Alice make her bits into 000 while
Bob also adds 0 to make his bits 100 and they win. They can win for any measurements by
choosing appropriate third bit. It can be proved that this quantum strategy wins for all the

15.8 Quantum Steering
In 1935 Schr¨odinger [128,129] introduced the concept of steering when responding to
the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox [130]. Quantum steering is a phenomenon
wherein, for example, Alice sharing an entangled state of a system with Bob (at a remote
place) can steer the state of the system of Bob by performing a measurement on her system
[131].
Consider a system consisting of two identical particles. Assume that the overall spin
of the system is zero and the spin of each particle is ~/2. In an experiment the system
is made to split into two particles and the total angular momentum is conserved. Each
particle moves in opposite directions. Due to the conservation of total angular momentum
if the spin of the particle-1 is in some direction then the spin of the particle-2 must be in
the opposite direction. The axis of rotation cannot be defined with certainty. Performing
measurement on a particle gives the particle a specific axis of rotation. But before the
measurement the particle cannot be said to spin about a well defined axis. Suppose in a
spin measurement each particle is found to posses z-component of its spin. Denote φ
1
+ (φ
1
−)
as the wave function of particle-1 with spin-up (spin-down). Similarly, define φ
2
±.
Without knowing the actual state of the particles we know that either particle-1 has
spin-up and the particle-2 has spin-down or versa. The superposition of product state given
by

constitute entangled states. In ψ1,2 the minus sign is because the total spin is zero. The
above ψ describes both particles together, even if they are far apart. A measurement on one
particle would collapse ψ1,2 to a definite state of the particles 1 and 2. Alice by measure￾ment on particle-1 steer the state on the particle-2. That is, quantum steering is a form oQuantum Diffusion 359
entanglement and a form of correlation realized in quantum mechanics. The locality princi￾ple implies that the actual situation of particle-2 is independent of the measurement done on
the particle-1 which is spatially separated. In the above, the principle of locality is violated.
Let ρ be an entangled state shared by Alice and Bob. They perform local measurements
on ρ. Denote the choice of the measurements as x and y with a and b being their correspond￾ing outputs. Positive-operator-valued mesures (POVMs) 
Ma|x
	
and 
Mb|y
	
can be used
to describe the measurements with Ma|x, Ma|y ≥ 0, P
a Ma|x = 1 and P
a Mb|y = 1 [132].
The probability distribution p(ab|xy) is Tr ￾
ρMa|x ⊗ Mb|y

. If p admits a decomposition of
the form
p(ab|xy) = Z
dλπ(λ)pA(a|x, λ)pB(b|y, λ) (15.108)
then p is said to be Bell local. In Eq. (15.108) λ is some variable or hidden variable with
probability density π(λ) and pA and pB are local probability functions. When Eq. (15.108)
is satisfied then ρ is said to be local or admitting a local hidden variable (LHV) model.
ρ is nonlocal and said to be violating a Bell inequality if the decomposition of p given by
Eq. (15.108) is not possible.
Suppose Bob not trusted Alice and wants to check whether ρ is entangled or not. Bob
asks Alice to carry out measurement x on particle-1. The result is a. The measurement by
Alice led to steering of the state of the particle-2 of Bob and so
σ(a|x) = TrA
￾
Ma|x ⊗ 1ρ

, (15.109)
where TrA represents the partial trace over particle-1. Bob has to now check whether σa|x
admit or not the decomposition form
σa|x =
Z
dλπ(λ)pA(a|x, λ)σλ , (15.110)
where σλ are some quantum states. The state ρ is steerable if 
σa|x
	
does not admit a de￾composition (15.110) and a local hidden state model. Any state violating a Bell inequality
can be made use for steering. ρ is unsteerable when for all the measurements if the decom￾position form (15.110) exists. Steering can be detected in this way. The following statements
have been proved [131–133]:
1. Any steerable state is entangled.
2. There are entangled states that cannot be steerable.
3. There are steerable states that do not violate any Bell inequality.
4. There are entangled states which are one-way steerable but not two-way steerable.
For methods of constructing states for the above cases and for explicit examples one may re￾fer to the ref. [132]. Methods to detect steerable state, quantifying them and their properties
[131] and experimental demonstration of steering [134–138] have been reported.
15.9 Quantum Diffusion
Spreading of a wave packet in a dissipative environment at zero temperature is termed
as quantum diffusion. This phenomenon is theoretically described by means of models of
quantum state diffusion [139], quantum Brownian motion [140], quantum drift-motion [141360 Some Other Advanced Topics
etc. It is a fundamental phenomenon associated with the atomic migration in crystalline
solids, where the quantum mechanical tunnelling plays a key role.
Consider a quantum particle of mass m moving in a vacuum [142]. We write the wave
function in the polar form as ψ(r, t) = √ρe
iS(r,t)/~
, where ρ(r, t) is the probability density
to find the quantum particle at a point r at time t and S is the phase of the wave function.
Substituting ψ in the Schr¨odinger equation
i~
∂ψ
∂t = −

2m
∇2ψ + Uψ (15.111)
and equating the real and imaginary parts separately to zero, we obtain

∂t + mV · ∇V = −∇U − ∇ · PQ/ρ , (15.112a)
∂ρt
∂t + ∇ · (ρV ) = 0 , (15.112b)
where the velocity V = ∇S/m represents the flow in the probability space and PQ =
−(~
2/4m)ρ∇ ⊗ ∇ ln ρ is the quantum pressure tensor [142]. When the quantum particle
moves in a dissipative medium it will experience a friction force, say, proportional to velocity
of the particle. In this case, Eq. (15.112a) becomes
m
∂V
∂t + mV · ∇V + dV = −∇(U + Q), (15.113)
where d is the friction constant and
Q = −~

Thus, Eq. (15.112b) describes the probability spreading in a dissipative environment, that
is, quantum diffusion.

We note that the classical Einstein diffusion constant is D = kBT /d. The point is that DQ
is not a universal constant and depends on the initial wave packet. This result explains the
large spread of quantum surface diffusion coefficient measured at low temperatures [143].

For a discussion on quantum diffusion in a periodic potential system one may refer to ref.
[142]. A general theory of quantum diffusion is developed to describe diffusion dynamics in
biased semiconductors and semiconductor superlattices [147]. The mechanism responsible
for quantum diffusion in the quasiperiodic kicked rotor is studied by Lignier et al.[148].
They reported experimental results on the diffusion constant on the atomic version of the
system and proposed a theoretical approach to account for the observed results. Anomalous
diffusions of wave packets in quasiperiodic systems has received a considerable interest [149].
Quantum diffusion in the generalized Harper equation is reported in ref. [150]. Transport
property of diffusion in a finite translationaly invariant quantum subsystem is analyzed

15.10 Quantum Chaos
In classical physics, dynamical systems are broadly classified into two classes: linear and
nonlinear. When the force acting on a system is directly proportional to displacement then
it is said to be a linear force otherwise a nonlinear force. The systems driven by linear
forces are termed as linear systems. The force acting on a linear harmonic oscillator is
F = −kx ∝ x and is thus a linear system. For an anharmonic oscillator and the pendulum
system the force is essentially nonlinear. Linear systems are described by linear differential
equations while the nonlinear systems are described by nonlinear differential equations. How
do we define nonlinear differential equations? In a differential equation if each of the terms,
after rationalization, has a total degree either 1 or 0 in the dependent variables and their
derivatives then it is a linear differential equation. Even if one of the terms has a degree
different from 0 or 1 in the dependent variables (and their derivatives) then it is nonlinear .
The presence of independent variables does not affect the linearity and nonlinearity nature.
The classical equation of motion of linear harmonic oscillator is linear while those of an
anharmonic oscillator and the pendulum system are nonlinear. The Schr¨odinger equation
is linear.
Linear systems display smooth and regular behaviour. In contrast, certain nonlinear sys￾tems are capable of exhibiting smooth and regular as well as complicated irregular behaviour
depending upon the various factors. A type of irregular dynamics exhibited by nonlinear
systems with phase space dimension greater than two is the chaotic motion. It is a nonperi￾odic and bounded motion with high sensitive dependence on initial conditions. In a chaotic
system two trajectories starting from two nearby initial conditions diverge exponentially
until they become completely uncorrelated so that the future state becomes unpredictable.
For a detailed discussion on classical chaos one may refer to refs. [152–154]. For microscopic
systems one may ask: What are the features of a quantum system whose classical counterpart
exhibits chaotic motion? In other words, what are the quantum manifestations of classical
chaos?
It has been argued that anything that erratically ‘wiggles’ and ‘jiggles’ in quantum
mechanics should be termed as quantum chaos. Berry defined quantum chaos as the study
of semiclassical, but nonclassical, behaviour characteristic of systems whose classical motion
exhibits chaos [155]. The problem of characterizing chaos in quantum mechanics naturally
divides into two classes [156]:Quantum Chaos 363
1. Static properties (eigenvalues and eigenfunctions) and
2. Dynamical properties (time evolution of localized initial states and observables).
For bounded quantum systems the energy eigenvalue spectrum is discrete. Consequently,
the dependence of the stationary state wave function on time is always almost periodic.
Therefore, stationary state wave function cannot display sensitive dependence on initial
conditions. Because the wave function itself is well behaved, it is hard to imagine the sensi￾tivity in the expectation values of observables [157]. On the other hand, for nonstationary
problems, for example, for periodic time-dependent Hamiltonians, the existence of the time
evolution operator and the Floquet’s theorems assert that the wave function to be quasiperi￾odic and thus sensitivity to initial state is precluded [157]. Therefore, we are compelled to
look at the signatures of chaos in the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
15.10.1 Signatures of Quantum Chaos
From many calculations it has been realized that a very fruitful approach to characterize
quantum chaos is the analysis of statistical properties of energy level sequences. Specifically,
the distribution (P(s)) of energy level spacing is the most significant characteristic of quan￾tum chaos. The Hermitian matrix representation of a Hamiltonian can be parametrized in
terms of its energies and the associated states. One can go from probability distribution
over matrix elements to a distribution over energies in Hilbert space. Assume that the en￾ergy eigenvalues Ei are arranged in increasing order. Then the level spacing between the
successive energy levels Ei and Ei+1 is Ei+1 −Ei
. We can find the level spacing distribution
P(s) over a set of random Hermitian matrices.
For classically integrable systems it has been proven that in the semiclassical limit,
successive energy levels arrive randomly, resulting in a Poisson distribution for P(s). For
general irregular systems (that is, nonintegrable) it has been conjectured [158] that spec￾tral fluctuations are reproduced by appropriate random matrix ensembles like Gaussian
orthogonal ensemble (GOE), Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) and Gaussian symplectic
ensemble (GSE) depending upon the underlying time-reversal symmetry and nature of the
spin of the system involved. The remarkable result is that in the case of systems with many
symmetries, P(s) reaches a maximum when s approaches zero and it becomes a minimum
for the case of few symmetries. That is, quantized regular systems display level clustering
while quantized chaotic systems show level repulsion. Consider the Hamiltonian of the form
H = H0 + λV , where λ is the strength of the perturbation. As λ varies, the energy levels
change but cannot cross each other unless there is a symmetry in the Hamiltonian. That
is, due to lack of symmetries of chaotic systems, energy levels avoid approaching at a short
distance from one another.
For a classically integrable system, due to the presence of many symmetries, one can
write the Hamiltonian in a block-diagonal form with one block per invariant subspace. This is
because two states |ii and |ji cannot have finite matrix elements hi|H|ji if H satisfies certain
symmetries. These blocks are statistically independent. The point is that within a block, the
energy levels are correlated. Levels belonging to different blocks cannot be identified in the
spectrum of the entire Hamiltonian. As a result, the energy spacing distribution becomes a
Poissonian, a characteristic of uncorrelated random variable.
For intermediate systems the phase space of a classical system consists of infinitely many
distinct regions filled with regular or irregular orbits. Assuming that the quantum spectrum
is generated by statistically independent superposition of Poisson and Wigner distributions,
Berry and Robnik [159] found semiclassical formula for P(s) that interpolates between
the two limiting distributions. For a time-dependent periodic Hamiltonians, a continuous
transition between Poisson to circular orthogonal ensemble statistics is observed when the364 Some Other Advanced Topics
corresponding classical system changes from regular to chaotic behaviour [160–162]. As far
as eigenfunctions are concerned, for integrable systems, regular nodal patterns and strongly
correlated wave functions are noticed. In contrast to this, for nonintegrable systems irregular
nodal pattern and negligible correlation between wave functions have been found [163].
15.10.2 Random Matrix Theory and Level Statistics
When the classical system is chaotic (nonintegrable) then its corresponding quantum ver￾sion follows the so-called random matrix theory results. Therefore, we point out the salient
features and some important results of random matrix theory relevant for the study of quan￾tum chaos. We mainly follow the ref. [164]. In nuclear physics often finding an appropriate
Hamiltonian is very difficult. Wigner suggested to study ensembles of Hamiltonians. The
ensembles are usually defined in a matrix space where all the Hamiltonian members of the
ensemble have the same symmetry properties like translational and rotational invariance or
time reversal or nontime reversal invariance. For the eigenvalues of these ensemble of matri￾ces we can analyze (i) nearest neighbor spacing distribution (NNSD) and (ii) ∆3-statistics.
NNSD is the probability P(s) for finding a separation s of neighboring levels in the eigen￾value spectrum. For a given subsequence [α, α + L] of the spectrum, ∆3(α, L) measures the
least-squares deviation of the spectral staircase function from the best straight-line fitting
it [165]:

special types of random matrices [166,167]. Some of them are given below.
15.10.2.1 Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE)

(15.126)
In addition to the above mentioned random matrix universality classes there are few
other universality classes useful for the study of quantum chaos. Some of them are the
following.
15.10.2.4 Poisson Statistics
For a classical system exhibiting regular and integrable dynamics the short range properties,
such as NNSD, of the corresponding energy level spectrum of the quantum mechanical
system tend to resemble that of Poisson spectrum. This is because the integrable or near
integrable properties translate into a number of independent conserved operator quantities
and each energy level can be characterized by the associated quantum numbers. Superposing
terms arising from independent contributions from the various quantum numbers generate
a spectrum that closely resembles a spectrum of random numbers. The NNSD for Poisson
spectrum is [155] P(s) = e−s while ∆3(L) = L/15. Note that Poisson statistics are identified
with clustering of levels so that there is a large probability for small spacing while random
matrix ensemble statistics are associated with level repulsion.
15.10.2.5 Intermediate Statistics
Many of the classical conservative systems are neither purely regular nor purely chaotic,
but show mixed behaviour. For the corresponding quantum mechanics systems the spectral
statistics will interpolate between those of the Poisson and the appropriate random matrix
universality classes. In this case
P(s) = (1 + q)αsq

(15.127)
and q represents the chaotic fraction of the classical phase space volume. The above distri￾bution is known as a Brody distribution. It become Poisson distribution for q = 0 and GOE
for q = 1. Generally, near-integrable systems show this kind of statistic.366 Some Other Advanced Topics
15.10.3 Hydrogen Atom in a Generalized van der Waals

where γ and β have different meanings under different physical situations. For example,
γ = B/(2.35×105 T) (the magnetic field parameter) and β = 0 correspond to the quadratic
Zeeman effect problem and γ = −1/(16d
3
), where d represents the distance from the atom
to a metal surface and β =
√
2, the system corresponds to the instantaneous van der Waals
interaction existing between the atom and nearby metal surface. Further, the Hamiltonian
(15.128) has a very close analogy with the Paul-trap Hamiltonian realized in precision
atomic spectroscopy for ion confinement.

It is possible to solve the eigenvalue Eq. (15.130) in many ways. A useful scheme is the
Crawford algorithm [170]. Ganesan and Lakshmanan [164,169] investigated the quantum
manifestation of chaos in the system with the Hamiltonian (15.128). They noticed that in
the classical system as the parameter β increases for arbitrary γ, there is a remarkable
chaos → order → chaos → order → chaos → order → chaos (15.131)
type of transition. Further, the system is found to be exactly integrable at β = 1/2, 1 and
2. In the quantum case as the parameter increases the level statistics has shown
GOE → P oisson → Brody → P oisson → Brody → P oisson → GOE (15.132)
type of transitions [164,169]. Table 15.4 summarizes classical and quantum results [169].
15.11 Concluding Remarks
Advanced research topics in quantum mechanics arise on the fundamental levels, quantum
analogue of newly observed classical phenomena, application of quantum theoretical treat￾ment and ideas to other branches of science and on the technological side. Deeper study of
basic quantum mechanical systems leads to the concepts like quantum revivals [171,172] and
quantum carpets [173–175]. Certain classical nonlinear systems display novel phenomena
such as stochastic resonance [176], vibrational resonance [177], auto-resonance [178,179],
ghost resonance [180,181], synchronization [182], amplitude death [183] to mention a few.
Quantum version of stochastic resonance is realized in certain quantum systems [184,185].
The quantum analogue of other nonlinear dynamics has to be explorBibliography 367

Until recently, biology and quantum mechanics were thought of as independent branches
of science. Interestingly experimental data have opened the possible realization of quantum
superposition, quantum entanglement and quantum coherence during certain biological pro￾cesses and systems [186–188]. It has been proposed that the so-called Fenna–Mathews–Olson
(FMO)
pigment protein complex executes a kind of quantum search algorithm which is seen to
be considerably more efficient than a classical random hopping mechanism [186]. Quan￾tum mechanical description is needed for describing cellular biochemical reactions, energy
metabolism in eukaryotes interaction of light and biological photo-receptors, etc. These
opened a new branch called quantum biophysics or quantum biology.
Quantum technology is occuping certain technologies such as image processing, metrol￾ogy, lithography, sensing, batteries and internet. In the next concluding chapter, we bring
out the underlying basics and the developments in them.

Quantum Technologies
16.1 Introduction
In contrast to conventional technology understandable by classical mechanics, quantum
technology relies on the principles of quantum physics. What is the need for quantum tech￾nology? There are mainly two good reasons for developing quantum engineering:
1. In the last fifty years or so, the size of the components of a computer has halved
every eighteen months, providing the technological boom for modern society. As
the computer components are decreasing in size, they approach atomic dimensions
more closely. Then quantum mechanics imposes a fundamental limit, beyond
which development of traditional technology is not feasible. To accomplish this, we
specifically need new and novel devices utilizing the laws of quantum mechanics.
2. The quantum devices promise to offer a vastly improved performance over that
achieved in a classical frame work.
Quantum technologies are expected to revolutionize our society in a similar way the semicon￾ductor electronics did in the second half of the twentieth century. But the task of developing
quantum technologies is an enormous challenge not only to physicists but also for engineers
and computer scientists.
What is the aim of quantum technology? Quantum technology aims to invent useful
devices and processes that are based on quantum principles such as quantization, uncer￾tainty principle, quantum superposition, tunnelling, entanglement and decoherence. The
development of fundametal concepts in quantum mechanics is considered as first quantum
revolution. The evolution of quantum technology is thought of as second quantum revolution
[1]. This revolution applies the features of quantum mechanics to change the quantum face
of the world.
Fundamental discoveries in the field of quantum information have the potential for a
dramatic impact on many technological fields. For example, quantum imaging is a newly
born branch of quantum optics. It investigates the ultimate performance limits of optical
imaging permitted by the principles of quantum mechanics. Recent developments in quan￾tum optics and information science have opened the possibility of entirely new schemes
of obtaining optical images with unexpected sensitivity and resolution. Quantum imaging
addresses the problem of image formation, processing and detection with sensitivity and
resolution beyond the limits of classical imaging.
According to classical physics, a beam of light has at least a minimum level of unavoid￾able noise, known as the shot-noise. Such a noise consists of natural random fluctuations
which will have influences in all the properties of the light. Quantum imaging utilizes the
latest achievements in quantum optics that allows to cut-off the distribution of quantum
fluctuations in the transverse area of light beams and to minimize these quantum fluctu￾ations below the shot-noise limit. This reduction of spatial quantum fluctuations provides
new avenues for greatly enhancing the performance in recording, storage and read-out of
DOI: 10.1201/9781003172192-16 375376 Quantum Technologies
optical images over the limits set by the shot-noise. Quantum imaging has found potential
applications in microscopy, wave front correlation, image processing, optical data storage
and optical measurements.
Considerable advancements have been realized in the following quantum technologies:
1. Ghost imaging.
2. Detection of weak amplitude objects.
3. Entangled two-photon microscopy.
4. Detection of small displacements.
5. Quantum lithography.
6. Quantum metrology.
7. Quantum teleportation of optical images.
8. Quantum sensors.
9. Quantum batteries.
10. Quantum internet.
In this last chapter we present the underlying basic ideas and the salient features of the
above fascinating quantum technologies. To start with, first we briefly describe the quantum
entangled photons utilized in many quantum technologies.
16.2 Quantum Entangled Photons
Entangled photons are key elements in quantum engineering. Historically, high quality
polarization-entangled states have been achieved through the nonlinear process of the so￾called spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). The first SPDC source of photon
pairs was given by Burnham and Weinberg in 1970 [2]. The entanglement of two-particle
system is with respect to a certain observable. For quantum entangled photons, three of
such observables are distinguished. They are polarization, energy or time and momentum
or space. The corresponding types of entanglement are called polarization, time and spatial
entanglement of photons, respectively. Note that the entanglement of photons is simultane￾ous in the three mentioned observables. Polarization-entangled photons are usually realized
in two ways: type-I and type-II. In type-I, two photons of similar polarization states are
entangled. In type-II, crossed polarization states of two photons are entangled.
Type-I entanglement sources have advantages due to their relatively high brightness,
stability and ease-of-entanglement. Sources based on type-II are dominant for ultrafast
entanglement generation and are limited by small solid angles over which entanglement
persists or require interferometric configurations.
In the SPDC process, a pump photon of frequency ωp is annihilated thereby producing a
signal and idler photon at frequency ωs and ωi
, respectively. The term parametric in SPDC
indicates that the down-conversion medium is unchanged in the process. Thus, a series of
conservation laws have to be satisfied by the pump, signal and idler photons. The relevant
conversion laws are:
ωp = ωs + ωi
, kp = ks + ki
. (16.1)Quantum Entangled Photons 377
The first and the second equations in Eqs. (16.1) are referred to as the frequency match￾ing condition and phase matching condition, respectively. The wave vectors in Eqs. (16.1)
are expressed as
kj =
nj (ωj )ωj
c
sj , (16.2)
where nj (ωj ) is the dispersive refractive index of the material dependent on frequency ωj ,
sj is the unit vector pointing in the kj direction and c is the speed of light. So, the second
equation in (16.1) becomes
np(ωp)ωpsp = ns(ωs)ωsss + ni(ωi)ωisi
. (16.3)
We note that the refractive index n for most dielectric materials decreases with increasing
frequency. Therefore, both frequency and phase matching conditions cannot be satisfied
simultaneously in an isotropic medium. But this is achievable in a birefringent medium like
β-barium-borate (BBO), where there are two different refractive indices no and ne for the
ordinarily (o) and extraordinarily (e) polarized light, respectively.
An e-polarized pump is used in a type-II down-conversion. The condition (16.3) with an
e-polarized pump is written in terms of no and ne as
ne(ωp)ωpsp = ne(ωe)ωese + no(ωo)ωoso . (16.4)
Observe that the down-conversion results in photon pairs with each consisting of an o￾polarized photon and an e-polarized photon. These are emitted from the down-conversion
process in two different cones from the crystal.
Let |Hi and |Vi be the horizontal and vertical polarization states of a photon, respec￾tively. Then for polarization-entangled photon pairs, we require two decay paths given by
the combinations |Hi1|Vi2 and |Vi1|Hi2. This situation is realized at the two intersections
of the e and o-emission cones. The entangled wave function describing the polarization￾entangled photon state is given by
|ψi =
1
√
2
￾
|Hoi1|Vei2 + eiδ
|Vei1|Hoi2

. (16.5)
Actually, the photon pairs at the intersection of the o and e-emission cones are not in
a pure polarization-entangled state given by (16.5). The refractive indices no and ne of the
birefringent crystal give rise to the difference in the velocity of the o and e waves in the
crystal. This results in a relative delay between the arrival time of the o and e-polarized
photon in each pair and is dependent on the site of the crystal where they are created.
Hence, when the photon pairs from all the creation sites are included, we get a mixed state
resulting in a lower polarization entanglement quality. We can minimize this problem using
a very thin crystal or using a combination of half-wave plate and compensation crystals
[3]. Also, the pair is obtained in such a way that the energy or time and momentum or
space of neither one is determinate. Hence, the state of a signal-idler photon pair of SPDC
is considered a typical entangled state described by the wave function [4]

16.3 Ghost Imaging
In the classical imaging, when a picture of an object is taken the camera captures photons
bounced-off the object of the image. Ghost imaging is the phenomenon in which images are
created by photons that never touched the object during their life time [5]. Ghost imaging
measures the correlation between two light beams, where only one beam probes the object.
Further, in ghost imaging, the entanglement of two or more different particles are used to
record images of unseen objects.
Some of the important definitions of ghost imaging [6]:
1. Ghost imaging is a visual image of an object obtained through light but without
allowing light to incident on the object.
2. Ghost imaging is a peculiar effect, where an image is obtained with light patterns
which do not emanate from the target.
3. It is a fascinating technique where the object and the image of the target are in
separate light paths.
4. It is similar to obtaining a flash photo of an object with an ordinary camera. In
an ordinary camera, the image is formed by the photons coming from the flash,
reflected by the object and focused with the lens on a photo film. But in ghost
imaging, the image is not constructed from the light that fell on the object and
reflected back.
Pittman and his coworkers [7] demonstrated the working principle of ghost imaging ex￾perimentally making use of entangled photon pairs as the light source. A simplified schematic
of the experiment is shown in Fig. 16.1. The nonlinear optical crystal-β-barium borate
(BBO) splits each photon into two entangled photons (of orthogonal polarization), referred
to as the signal and idler photon. The polarizing beam splitter sends the signal photon
up towards the object under consideration and the idler towards the CCD (charge coupled
device) camera that will image it. The object is an absorbing screen with a pattern to be
imaged.
The signal photon either hits the screen and is absorbed or it passes through an aperture
and detected by a bucket detector which only indicates whether or not a photon hit but
does not provide information about the location where it hit. The bucket detector cannot
produce any image of the object. The CCD camera detects the position of the idler photon.
The information from the CCD camera and the bucket detector are allowed to pass through
a coincidence circuit. This circuit would record the data from the CCD camera only if
photons hit both the detectors simultaneously. An image of the object is built-up once a
sufficient number of photons have been accumulated in a computer. Notice that an image
has been recorded by the CCD camera though the photons hit the CCD have not come
from the object.
As the two photons are quantum entangled, they are linked to one another though they
may be separated by a distance. The position where the two photons hit their respective
targets are correlated. Ghost imaging that uses the quantum entangled photons is called
type-I ghost imaging. It has been demonstrated experimentally [8] that quantum entangle￾ment is not required to get ghost imaging. It has been proved that even classically correlated
photons can give rise to ghost imaging which is called the type-II thermal ghost imaging.
Quantum ghost imaging with entangled swapped photons [9], quantum states of light
[10], atoms [11], biphotons [12] and security test based on quantum entanglement [13] have
been reported. Quantum ghost imaging has potential applications in remote sensing, satelliteDetection of Weak Amplitude Object 379

16.4 Detection of Weak Amplitude Object
Let us consider the case of a weak amplitude object located, say, in the signal branch of the
SPDC far field. Both signal and idler are noisy with respect to fluctuations of intensity as380 Quantum Technologies
FIGURE 16.2
A typical experimental set-up for weak amplitude detection. (Reproduced with permission

their photon number statistics are thermal. Therefore, in the high gain regime, the signal￾to-noise ratio (SNR) characterizing the detection of a weak object in the signal field can
be quite low. But, fluctuations in the intensity difference between signal and idler are small
because of the spatial quantum correlation. Hence, if the object is detected using the signal￾idler intensity difference, the SNR becomes much better. It has been shown that when the
absorption is weak enough, the SNR value can be enhanced beyond the standard quantum
limit [19]. Further, by making use of the strong correlation in noise of entangled modes of
light produced by SPDC, the image of a weak absorbing object hidden in the noise in one
part, can be recovered by subtracting the spatial noise measured in the other part [20]. This
is termed as sub-shot-noise quantum imaging (SSNQI).
The above imaging experiment is conceptually similar to the ghost imaging experiment.
Let us denote Ni and Ns as the photon numbers of an idler and signal, respectively. Then
Ni(X) and Ns(−X), at X and −X in the far field are correlated because of conservation
of the transverse components of the momentum. For the case of λs = λi (degeneracy wave￾length), the correlation degree is characterized by the noise reduction factor (NRF ) [21]

σ is normalized with respect to the shot-noise limit (Ni + Ns). For SPDC, due to the
correlation in Ni(X) and Ns(−X) in Eq. (16.10), σ becomes σ = 1 − η where the balanced
losses are assumed as ηi = ηs = η. Therefore, in an ideal case (η = 1), σ approaches zero.
What is the result for classically correlated beams? For the subtraction of two classical
beams we have σCL ≥ 1. The lowest limit σCL = 1 is reached for coherent beams or
classically correlated beams.
In a typical experimental set-up [21] shown in Fig. 16.2, a UV laser beam pumps a
type-II BBO crystal producing SPDC. After removing the pump beam the correlated signal
beam is allowed to cross a weakly absorbing object and is then directed to a CCD array.
The other idler beam is directly sent to another area of the CCD camera.
The experiment measures the intensity pattern in signal branch (where the object has
been placed) and then subtracts the correlated noise pattern measured in the idler branch.
The number of photons detected in the presence of the object in the signal region is N0
s

then SSNQI gives an advantage with respect to a classical differential imaging for a weakly
absorbing object (α → 0) once σ < 1. Brida et al [22] first realized experimentally SSNQI.

noise levels [26], use of squeezed light for sub-shot noise imaging [27,28] and enhancement
of detection [29], displacement measurement [30] and biological measurement [31] below the
standard quantum limit were investigated.
16.5 Entangled Two-Photon Microscopy
Microscopy based on classical sources of light are considerably noisy because of the photons
arriving randomly in time and position. In recent years there has been a lively interest
in entangled-photon microscopy. The two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscopy
(TPLSM) is found to be more efficient. This technique uses a highly focused optical beam
in order to localize the region from which fluorescence is observed. For classical light the
rate of simultaneous absorption of n photons is proportional to φ
n, where φ is the optical
photon flux density. So, in TPLSM, the rate of two-photon absorption is proportional to
φ
2
. This is a quadratic behaviour and is a result of the accidental arrival of pairs of photons
emitted by a classical light source. Therefore, TPLSM needs the utility of high photon
flux density sources (such as femtosecond pulsed lasers), to make sure that two photons
have a significantly considerable probability of reaching simultaneously and resulting in an
absorption.
Entangled photon microscopy (EPM) using quantum photon pairs as source was pro￾posed [32]. In EPM, the entangled photons’ arrival times are correlated. As a result the
two-photon absorption rate is substantially enhanced. This process depends linearly, on the
photon flux density [33]. Consequently, lower values of the photon flux density are also used
in EPM. It has been realized that correlated two-photon absorption dominates over random
two-photon absorption in the case of small values of photon-flux density (below a critical
photon flux density φc). If φc is sufficiently large, EPM has a number of features rendering
it superior to TPLSM. A typical experimental set-up for EPM is shown in Fig. 16.3.
EPM offers several advantages over TPLSM. Some of them are listed below:382 Quantum Technologies

1. EPM operates at reduced levels of light compared to TPLSM, minimizes unde￾sirable photo-toxicity and photo-bleaching.
2. By appropriate optical components the two excitation beams can be directed to
cross one another with a variable relative path length delay. This permits us to
select the position in the specimen at which the entangled photons arrive simul￾taneously. Moreover, they can be arranged to intersect the specimen in various
configurations, including multiple locations.
3. It gives increased resolution and localization in both the axial and lateral direc￾tions.
4. EPM causes the resolution and localization to be independent of laser power
fluctuations. The influence of misalignment errors are reduced in EPM relative
to TPLSM.
5. The low light level needed for EPM opens the possibility of using continuous wave
rather than pulsed sources of light.
6. The frequency spectrum of the summed energy of the entangled photon pair is
narrow. Thus, with EPM we can effectively investigate the materials with narrow
two-photon absorption spectra.
Applications of two-photon microscopy for brain imaging [34], bioimaging [35], clini￾cal research [36,37], Raman excitation [38], detecting optically forbidden transition [39],
semiconductor devices [40] are possible.
16.6 Detection of Small Displacements
Measurement of the position of a laser spot accurately is necessary in certain fields. The
measurement of displacement of a light beam is often done as shown in Fig. 16.4 [41]. A
split detector is used to measure the intensities of the two parts of the image plane. If
the intensity difference is gradually displaced, a curve such as that shown in Fig. 16.4 isDetection of Small Displacements 383

obtained. Close to the point of exact balance, it is noticed that the difference between these
intensities gives a signal which is proportional to the beam displacement D. The limitation
in the precision in the measurement of the displacement is set by noise. For a classical,
shot-noise limited laser source, the smallest measurable displacement (denoted as DSQL) is
worked out as [8]
DSQL =
√
N
2I(0) . (16.14)
For a TEM00 Gaussian beam with radius ω0, DSQL becomes

r
π
8
ω0
√
N
. (16.15)
ω0 = λ for a maximum focusing of the Gaussian beam. In this case DSQL ≈ λ/√
N. It is
simply the absolute minimum displacement of a system measurable with the use of classical
beam. Equation (16.15) suggests that a more powerful laser or a longer measurement time
would provide enhanced measurement precision. But in many applications it is not practical
to use a very powerful laser.
A single spatial mode, even squeezed, is not useful to reduce the noise in a displacement
measurement below the shot-noise limit. This is because it lacks spatial correlation [42].
As the signal and idler beams in SPDC are correlated (both temporally and spatially), it
has been proposed that these two beams could be useful in the two half parts of the image
plane in the split detector. Now, the number of photons in the two paths is the same. As a
result the fluctuations in the intensity difference are quite small. Hence, we can surpass the
measurement limit in Eq. (16.15).
Small transverse displacement of a light beam beyond the standard quantum limit has
been measured [43]. A strong spatially correlated light source was obtained. This can be384 Quantum Technologies
achieved, for example, by mixing a vacuum squeezed beam and a coherent beam falling
in two specific orthogonal spatial modes. The position of this light beam can be measured
using a beam split detector with an increased precision compared to the standard quantum
limit. Further, a quantum laser pointer, a light beam the direction of which is measured with
a precision higher than that possible with a usual laser beam, was achieved experimentally
[44].
16.7 Quantum Lithography
The semiconductor industry exploits optical lithography to etch patterns on silicon wafer
for making integrated circuits. So, the reduction in the size of the electronic components
consequently depends on the minimum resolution of the light set forth. For classical light,
the minimum resolution is given by Rayleigh criterion. It states that the minimal resolvable
size occurs at a spacing corresponding to the distance between a peak and the adjacent
through in an interference pattern. This criterion renders a limit for the resolution to be
half the wavelength of the light used. We can reduce the size of the components making
use of shorter wavelength. But use of high energy photons may cause damage to the object
under investigation. Moreover, efficient mirrors and lenses for such short wavelengths are
not easily available. So, it is impractical to consider the classical optical lithography for
wavelengths shorter than about 100 nm.
Even using a classical light source we can double the resolution with two-photon absorp￾tion [45]. Quantum lithography which utilizes interference between groups of N-entangled
photons has been proposed to overcome the diffraction limit by a factor N [46]. We give
below the theory of quantum interferometric optical lithography proposed by Boto et al
[46].
Figure 16.5 shows the interferometric lithographic set-up. Photons entering the ports A
and B are made to strike the symmetric, lossless beam splitter (BS). Next, they are reflected
by two mirrors (M). The photon amplitude in the upper path acquires a phase-shift φ at
the phase-shifter (PS). Finally, the two branches interfere on the substrate S. In a typical
classical interferometric lithography, when two coherent laser lights intersect at an angle
2θ then the normalized exposure dose at the substrate corresponding to the grazing angle
θ = π/2 is found to be 1 + 2 cos kx, where k = 2π/λ and φ = kx. The Rayleigh criterion
requires that φmin = π/2. This gives xmin = λ/2. This is the best resolution that is realizable
using uncorrelated classical light.
In Yablonvich and Vrijen scheme [45], the classical two-photon are absorbed. So, two￾photon the absorption probability scales quadratically with intensity. In this case the clas￾sical two-photon exposure dosage is

Note that if cos 2φ in the above equation is eliminated then the cos 4φ term gives xmin,2γ =

In the theory of Boto et al. [46], the two input ports A and B are identified by the two
annihilation operators a and b, respectively. These operators obey the photon commutation

For classical uncorrelated light, the input state is |ψI i = |1iA|0iB because the photons
are incident one at a time on A. So, the classical deposition rate is given by
∆1γ(φ) = hψI |δ1|ψI i = 1 − sin 2φ = 1 + cos(2φ + π/2). (16.20)
This is the usual classical result, apart from an unimportant phase factor. The classical
two-photon deposition rate is then given by Eq. (16.16) dropping the phase factor. This
gives xmin = λ/4. This minimum value is achievable using a nonclassical product state
|ψII i = |1iA|1iB. This state is the output of a SPDC event. The deposition rate for this
state is ∆q
2γ = hψII |δ2|ψII i = 1+cos 4φ, where the cos 2φ term does not appear as in the case
of the classical two-photon absorption technique. Consequently, the quantum lithographic
pattern gives the same xmin = λ/4 with a narrower feature compared to the classical pattern.
The improvement has arisen because of quantum entanglement of the two photons. The
input state |ψII i = |1iA|1iB, after BS but before PS at the points A0 and B0 becomes the

as a result of interference effects upon passaging through BS. However, notice that the
entanglement is between photon number and path. It is not possible to state whether both
photons followed the lower path or the upper path. These two photons appeared as a
single quantum mechanical object called a diphoton. The amplitude corresponding to the
indistinguishable two paths would interfere after the diphoton passed the upper path thereby
acquiring twice the phase-shift as with a single-photon process. So, at C and D the entangled

It is with a resolution of λ/(2N), N-times smaller than the classical value.
Though theoretically, quantum lithography is found to be more efficient than the classical
one, the practical implementation of quantum lithography has to overcome several problems.
Two significant experimental challenges are:
1. Producing efficient intense source of photons in N00N state and
2. finding a sensitive N-photon lithographic recording medium.
For more discussions on quantum lithography one may refer to refs. [47–57].
16.8 Quantum Metrology
Metrology is the science of measurement and estimation of parameters of a system. Quan￾tum metrology [58] takes into account (i) the quantum character of the systems and (ii)
processes involved in the estimation of parameters. It also deals with the physical limits to
measurements. Essentially, the use of quantum correlations leads to high precision phase
measurements even with a lower particle flux than would be needed by classical systems.
A typical measurement consists of three parts: the preparation of a probe, its interaction
with the measuring system and the probe read-out. All measurements have statistical errors
and are due to insufficient control of the probes or of the measured systems. Errors may
occur as a consequence of fundamental constraint like the Heisenberg uncertainty relations.
They can be reduced by repeating the measurement, say N-times, and then averaging the
outcomes. This process may be repeated either with N-series of probes over time or with
N-multiple probe systems simultaneously.
The error in a parameter estimation may be quantified by means of the statistical average
of the square of the difference between the estimated and the true value of the parameter.
1A N00N state is a many body entangled state given by |ψE(N, φ)i = √1
2
[|Ni|0i + eiNφ|0i|Ni], where
|0i|Ni represents 0 particle in one mode and N particle in another mode and the phase factor is Quantum Metrology 387
The Cram´er–Rao limit [59] provides a lower bound to this error and is inversely proportional
to √
N, where N is the number of repetitions of the measurement process. This is the case
of classical measurement techniques. This limit is called the standard quantum limit (SQL).
Using quantum mechanical strategies such as entanglement among the various probing
devices used, we are able to get still lower bound, the so-called Heisenberg bound. This
bound varies as 1/N, an improvement of √
N times the classical accuracy.
In a single parameter estimation, Cram´er–Rao bound is stated in terms of a quantity
known as Fisher information [60]. Larger Fisher information results in a more accurate
determination of the parameter. The quantum of information to be extracted from experi￾ments about the exact value of a parameter is given by the Fisher information. This Fisher
information depends on various factors including properties of the probe, the parameter￾dependent process and the measurement on the probe considered to investigate the process.
An important aim of metrology is to determine the Fisher information to identify the ways
to maximize it and also to find protocols for better estimation. The ultimate estimation is
realized by maximizing the quantum Fisher information.
The phase difference between interfering two light beams is a significant parameter which
requires high precision. Optical phase measurement is useful to measure distance, position
displacement, acceleration and optical path length. High precision optical phase measure￾ments have several notable applications, such as microscopy, defining time-standards, mea￾suring magnetic fields, material properties, gravity-wave detection and medical and biolog￾ical sensing. The method of using non-classical states of light (the squeezed states) in order
to enhance optical interferometers’ sensitivity below the shot-noise limit has been proposed
[61].
In quantum metrology, N00N states are the enabling technology in quantum measure￾ment schemes. In optics a N00N state with N-entangled photons get a phase at a rate
N-times of that acquired by the classical light, as discussed in the previous section. This
leads to greatly improved phase sensitivity and is useful for attaining the Heisenberg limit.
We show below that N00N states lead to this limit.
We have seen in the previous section that the classical state |ψI i = |1iA|0iB becomes the
state |ψ(φ)i = (|0i+eiφ
|1i)/

Since A2 = 1, the variance of A (denoted as (∆A)
2
), is computed to be [62]
(∆A)
2 = N(1 − cos2 φ) = N sin2 φ . (16.26)
Then according to the estimation theory, the uncertainty in φ is [62]
∆φ =

This is the standard uncertainty in φ after N trials. The point is that the uncertainty
associated with the classical measurement of phase is inversely proportional to the square￾root of the number of trials. This is called the shot-noise limit.
Quantum entanglement can considerably enhance the sensitivity of this scheme by a
factor √
N. For the nm-classical input state |1i|1i in Fig. 16.5, at the screen we obtain
|ψE(N, φ)i = |N, 0i + eiNφ|0, Ni (the N00N state). For the phase estimation operator
AN = |0, NihN, 0| + |N, 0ih0, N|, we find hψE(N, φ)|AN |ψE(N, φ)i = cos Nφ. Notice that388 Quantum Technologies

We obtain the Heisenberg limit to the minimal detectable phase with notable improvement
of √

An optical phase measurement has been shown [63] with an entangled four-photon in￾terference visibility higher than the threshold to beat the standard quantum limit. N00N
states based on nuclear spin [64] and atomic spin waves [65] have been shown to achieve
improved measurement sensitivity. Recent theoretical work has pointed out that interaction
among particles is a very good resource for quantum metrology, scaling beyond the Heisen￾berg limit [66] and this was proved experimentally [67]. We know that any real system
cannot be totally isolated from the environment. This leads to decoherence, which miti￾gates quantum effects, thereby setting limitations on the use of quantum strategies. The
work reported [68] provides a general framework for quantum metrology in the presence of
noise.
For various advances and the applications made on quantum metrology one may refer
to the refs. [61,69–73]. Quantum metrology with multiparameter estimation [74], atomic en￾sembles [75], quantum error correction [76], non-Markovian environments [77], entanglement
against noise [78], entangled coherent states [79,80], compatability features [81], sensitiv￾ity beyond Heisenberg limit [82] and scanning probe atom interferometer [83] have been
analyzed.

16.9 Quantum Teleportation of Optical Images
Sokolov and his coworkers [84] proposed a continuous variable teleportation scheme to tele￾port the quantum state of spatially multimode electromagnetic fields. This method allows
the reconstruction of an image with preserving its quantum correlation. It generalizes the
proposal in the refs.[85,86]. Solokov et al established the possibility of achieving parallel
teleportation of two-dimensional optical images by taking into account a spatially multi￾mode field. The crucial part of the scheme is a pair of EPR light beams. As a consequence of
the multimode nature of entanglement the scheme can be used for parallel teleportation of
N elements of input wave front with the preservation of their space and time correlations.
The EPR beams are obtained by interference mixing at a 50 : 50 beam splitter of two
multimode broadband squeezed beams, generated by two degenerate optical parametric
amplifiers (OPA). It is possible to generate them by a single broadband OPA, degenerate
in frequency, with type-II phase matching.
Let E1(ρ, t) and E2(ρ, t) be the two EPR beam fields and Ain(ρ, t) is the input image
field. To detect the components of the input field, it is mixed with the EPR beam E1(ρ, t) at
a 50 : 50 beam splitter. By this we get the input fields of two balanced homodyne detectors
Dx and Dy:
Bx,y(ρ, t) = 1
√
2
[±Ain(ρ, t) + E1(ρ, t)] (16.32)
with +(−) sign corresponding to x(y). These fields are mixed with two oscillator fields with
amplitudes B0 and −iB0, where B0 is real, at two symmetric beam splitters. Suppose the
pixels of the CCD matrices are smaller than the coherence area of the EPR beam. In this
case the photo-currents collected from the pixels Dx and Dy at the points ρ are given by
Ix = B0

Bx(ρ, t) + B
†
x
(ρ, t)

, Iy = −iB0

By(ρ, t) − B
†
y
(ρ, t)

. (16.33)
These currents are sent from Alice to Bob through two multichannel classical communication
lines. Bob uses them for local modulation of an external coherent wave phase matched with
the EPR fields. In the modulated beam, the field component proportional to Ix − iIy is
created. The teleported field Aout(ρ, t) is got by interference mixing at a mirror with high
reflectivity of the field with the second EPR beam E2(ρ, t). The teleported field Aout(ρ, t)
becomes
Aout(ρ, t) = Ain(ρ, t) + F(ρ, t) , (16.34)
where F(ρ, t) = Ee2(ρ, t) + Ee†
1
(ρ, t) is the noise field added by the teleportation process.
In the ideal case of perfect entanglement of the EPR beams, E2(ρ, t) and E
†
1
(ρ, t) are per￾fectly anticorrelated and thereby cancel their quantum fluctuations. This corresponds to the
perfect point-to-point in space and instantaneous in time teleportation of the quantum state
of the input fields (as Aout(ρ, t) equals Ain(ρ, t)). As this process appears like holography,
it is called as quantum holographic teleportation. In a new version of quantum holographic
teleportation [87] quantum entanglement between the light fields of different frequencies is
used. It permits the wavelength conversion between the original and the teleported images.
16.10 Quantum Sensors
Quantum sensors employ quantum probes to estimate parameters. A quantum sensor makes
use of a quantum system, quantum properties or quantum phenomena to perform a mea-390 Quantum Technologies
surement of a physical quantity. It can estimate a parameter with precision beyond what is
possible by classical resources [88]. Quantum sensors are being used for sensing and estimat￾ing various physical quantities ranging from magnetic and electric fields, time, frequency,
rotations, phonon density, gravity, voltage, displacement, refractive index, temperature and
pressure. As quantum systems have strong sensitivity to external disturbances quantum
sensors are expected to have high sensitivity.
1. Definition
Quantum sensing is defined by any one of the following [89]:
1. Use of a quantum object such as the quantized energy levels to measure a physical
quantity.
2. Use of quantum coherence (wave-like spatial and temporal superposition states)
to measure a physical quantity.
3. Use of quantum entanglement to get sensitivity and precision of a measurement
beyond that can be achieved by classical sensors.
2. Attributes
For a quantum system to function as a quantum sensor, it must have the following four
attributes [89]:
1. The quantum system must have discrete resolvable energy levels. For example, it
can be a two-level system with upper energy level |1i and lower energy level |0i
with the energy difference E = ~ω0. Changes in the transition frequency ω0 or
the transition rate Γ can be sensed by a quantum probe.
2. It should be possible to initialize the quantum system to a known state and to
read-out its state.
3. An external time-dependent field must be able to coherently manipulate the quan￾tum system.
4. The quantum system should interact with a relevant physical quantity V (t) such
as an electric field and magnetic field. The interaction is quantified by the pa￾rameter γ = ∂
qE/∂V q which gives the change of energy with respect to change
of V (t).
3. Characteristics
Certain physical characteristics can be defined and used for applicability and experimental
realization of quantum sensors. One characteristic is the type of external parameter(s) for
which the quantum system responds to. For example, a trapped ion quantum system re￾sponds to external electric field whereas a spin-based system is sensitive to external magnetic
field. Sensor’s intrinsic sensitivity is the second characteristic. The sensitivity of a quantum
sensor is decided by two conflicting factors. Though a strong response to an external signal
will increase the sensitivity, the unwanted noise will also affect the sensitivity of that system
more. The sensitivity is proportional to 1/(γ
√
TX) [89], where TX is the decoherence time.
Large γ and longer decoherence time will optimize the sensitivity.
4. Examples
An exhaustive list of the most important experimental implementations of quantum sensors
exists [89]. A Rydberg atom is an excited atom having one or more electrons with veryQuantum Sensors 391
high principal quantum number n. Such atoms are suitable for sensing electric fields. The
loosely confined electrons found in a highly excited state are coupled by electric dipole
transitions. These transitions are strong and the states undergo strong Stark shifts [90,91].
Laser excitation and spectroscopy are useful for preparation and read-out of states. Rydberg
atoms are utilized as single-photon sensors in a cryogenic cavity for microwave photons [92–
95]. Rydberg states are also used to detect weak electric fields [96,97] and microwave.
Beams of neutrons have been used for the measurement of Berry’s phase by introducing
spin rotations by means of magnetic fields along the parts of the neutron trajectory [98]. Spin
polarization of slow beams of thermal neutrons are possible by employing Bragg reflection
on an appropriate magnetic crystal. Using spin sensitive Bragg analyzer the spin read-out
is realizable. Sensing gravity on small length scale by ultracold neutrons is feasible. This
experimental sensing process considers the reflection of the matter waves associated with
slow neturons by suitable materials and trapping of the neutrons over a bulk surface by the
earth’s gravity [99]. Certain properties of materials can be explored by the measurement of
small (1 neV) energy loss of neutrons in inelastic scattering process.
Sensing qubits by alkali atoms, magnetic/electric fields by atomic vapors, cold atomic
clouds, trapped ions, NMR ensemble, SQUIDs and single electron transistors, phase-drift
of a local oscillator by atomic clocks, materials characterization and measuring small fields
(∼ 100 fT) of electric currents in the brain and signal processing by SQUIDs have been
reported. Optomechanical sensors are applied to measure minute forces (12 zN/
√
Hz), mass
(2 yg/
√
Hz), acceleration (100 ng/
√
Hz) and voltage (5 pV√
Hz).
5. Sensing Protocol
The quantum sensing protocol consists of the following three elementary steps [89]:
1. The initialization of the quantum sensors.
2. The interaction with the signal of interest.
3. The read-out of the final state.
Phase estimation [100] and parameter estimation [101] techniques are then used to recon￾struct the physical quantity from a series of measurements. An intereference measurement
using pump-probe spectroscopy is generally done.
The generic Hamiltonian to describe the quantum sensors is assumed as
H(t) = H0 + HV (t) + Hc(t), (16.35)
where H0 is the internal Hamiltonian, HV (t) is the Hamiltonian for the signal V (t) and
Hc is the control Hamiltonian which is chosen for manipulating and tuning the sensor in a
controlled way. The aim of the sensor is to measure V (t) from the effect it has on the qubit
due to its Hamiltonian HV under the control of Hc. The internal Hamiltonian may be a
static one with two energy eigenvalues E0 and E1 with eigenstates |0i and |1i. So, H0 can
be given as
H0 = E0|0ih0| + E1|1ih1| . (16.36)
The signal Hamiltonian HV (t) acts as a small perturbation to H0 and it can be separated
into two parts, namely, parallel and transverse components as
HV (t) = HVk
(t) + HV⊥ (t), (16.37)392 Quantum Technologies
where HVk
(t) is the parallel and HV⊥ (t) is the transverse components. If γ is the coupling
constant then the two components can be given as
HVk
(t) = 1

γVk (|1ih1| − |0ih0|), (16.38a)
HV⊥ (t) = 1

. (16.38b)
The parallel and transverse components of V (t) have different effects on the sensors as
HVk
(t) commutes with H0 and HV⊥ (t) does not commute with H0.
Solved Problem 3:
Show that the signal Hamiltonian HV (t) = (γ/2)V(t) · σ, for the two signal functions
Vk(t) and V⊥(t) defined by Eqs. (16.38) gives Vk = Vz(t) and V⊥ = Vx + iVy if the qubit
quantization axis is taken as the z-axis, apart from a phase factor.
We write HV = (γ/2) (Vxσx + Vyσy + Vzσz), HVk = (γ/2)Vzσz and HV⊥ =
(γ/2) (Vxσx + Vyσy). Then Eq. (16.38a) gives Vzσz = Vk (|1ih1| − |0ih0|). As

From Eqs. (16.40)-(16.42) we find V⊥ = Vx + iVy.
A typical quantum sensing process contains the following steps [89]. First, the quantum
sensor is initialized to a basis state, say, |0i. Then the transformation |ψ0i = Ua|0i is appliedQuantum Sensors 393
to get the desire initial sensing state |ψ0i using a set of control pulses represented by Ua.
After that the |ψ0i evolves for a time duration t under the Hamiltonian H and we get the
final sensing state
|ψ(t)i = UH(0, t)|ψ0i = C0|ψ0i + C1|ψ1i, (16.43)
where |ψ0i and |ψ1i are orthogonal. Next, |ψ(t)i is transformed into the read-out state |αi

is the measurable transition probability. The measurement apparatus detects 0 and 1 as a
voltage, current, photon counts or polarization. This whole process is repeated many times
to get more accurate estimate of p. p is measured as a function of time or as a function of
a parameter of the control Hamiltonian. Then using the data {pi} the desired signal V is
inferred.
As an example of this quantum sensing protocol, let us consider the measurement of the
static energy splitting ω0 using Ramsey interferometry measurement [89,102,103]. After the
quantum sensor is initialized into |0i a π/2 pulse transforms it into
|ψ0i = |+i =

Measurement of p as a function of t gives the frequency. In this way, Ramsey measurement
can be used to measure the energy splitting ω0.
Many advanced sensing techniques like adaptive methods to enhance the dynamic range
of sensors, techniques using multiple qubits, entangled enhanced sensing and quantum cor￾rection schemes have been discussed in [89]. Multiparameter estimation [104], evaluating
resources for precesion measurement [105], layer thickness measurement using terahertz
photons [106], sensing with a single electron spin [107], enhancement of nuclear spin imag￾ing [108] and nano sensors prepared with implanted nitrogen-vacancy centers [109] have
been reported.
Quantum sensing is an exciting new development which is linking various efforts in
science and technology thereby developing new applications in metrology. Applications of
quantum sensing continue to expand as new types and more sophisticated advanced sensor
implementations are more and more available. Quantum sensing become an important re￾source for quantum technologies as it can help to understand decoherence which affects all

16.11 Quantum Batteries
It is well known that collective quantum phenomena offer many advantages compared to
classical systems in areas such as computations, secure communication and metrology. It has
been found that quantum batteries can have more advantages than the classical batteries
[110–115]. Robert Alicki and Mark Fannes suggested that the entangling operations lead
to increased work extraction from an energy storage device called quantum battery [112].
A battery is a physical system where energy is stored. Quantum batteries are quantum
mechanical systems for storing energy, where quantum effects can be used to obtain more
efficient and faster charging and discharging compared to classical analog systems. In a
quantum battery energy is stored in the energy levels and coherence.
1. Hamiltonian and Density Matrix
Let us consider the wave functions of the battery to be chosen in a d-dimensional Hilbert
space H. The basis of H is chosen as the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian H of the system.
H is assumed as [112]
H =
X
d
j=1
j |jihj| , j+1 > j . (16.49)
The internal Hamiltonian H is expressed with increasing energy levels j and are assumed
to be nondegenerate. A simple quantum battery can be considered as a spin-1/2 system
to which a uniform magnetic field is applied. Its internal Hamiltonian has a higher energy
level  for the eigenvector |1i and − for the eigenvector | − 1i. We can think of |1i state as
a charged battery and | − 1i state as the empty battery. No work can be deposited into |1i
state and no work can be extracted from | − 1i state.
If the initial state of the battery is described by a density matrix ρ then the internal
energy of the battery is given by Tr(ρH). Charging a battery is to change the battery state
ρ to a more energetic state ρ
0
such that Tr [(ρ
0 − ρ)H] ≥ 0. Usuage of the battery will take
it to a lower energy state ρ
00 such that Tr [(ρ
00 − ρ)H] ≤ 0. Both charging and discharging
processes are done by unitary processes. This is achieved by using time-dependent fields
V (t) which act for the duration 0 ≤ t ≤ τ . V (t) = 0 for t > τ .
Let us consider that the field V (t) is used to extract energy from the battery. At time
t = 0, ρ = ρ(0). To find ρ(t) we consider the Liouville–von Neumann equation (~ = 1)
ρ˙(t) = −i [H + V (t), ρ(t)] . (16.50)
A solution of Eq. (16.50) is written as
ρ(t) = U(t)ρU†
(t), ρ = ρ(0), (16.51)
where U is the time-ordered unitary transformation on the Hilbert space H of the battery.
During the charging process no heat will be generated since the evolution is unitary.
With T being the time-ordering operator U is given as the exponential of the generator
H + V (t) as [112]
U(τ ) = T

2. Ergotropy − Maximal Extractable Work
We find the work W extracted after time τ by the above procedure as
W = Tr [ρH] − Tr [ρ(τ )H] = Tr [ρH] − Tr 
U(τ )ρU†
(τ )H

. (16.53)Quantum Batteries 395
The average charging power is P = W/τ . We can get the maximum amount of work by
optimizing W over all unitary operations. Therefore, the maximal amount of extractable
work Wmax is defined as
Wmax = Tr [ρH] − min Tr 
U(τ )ρU†
(τ )H

. (16.54)
The minimum in Eq. (16.54) is found by taking all unitary transformations of the Hiolbert
space H. Wmax is known as ergotropy [112,116].
An energy state σ is called a passive state if no work can be extracted from it
[112,117,118]. Then for such a σ, for all the unitary transformations U
Tr(σH) ≤ Tr(UσU†H). (16.55)
Equivalently, σ is passive if and only if [112]
σ =
X
d
j=1
sj |jihj| , sj+1 ≤ sj . (16.56)
So, σ is passive if and only if it commutes with H and further its eigenvalues sj are not
increasing with energy. For a given state ρ there exists a unique passive state σρ which can
be obtained by a unitary transformation Uρ as
σρ = UρρU†
ρ =
X
d
j=1
λj |jihj| , λj+1 ≤ λj , (16.57)
where λj are the eigenvalues of ρ. Using Eqs. (16.49) and (16.57) we find the minimal energy
as Pd
j=1 λj j and the maximum amount of extractable work as
Wmax = Tr(ρH) − Tr(σρH). (16.58)
3. Lower Bound On Wmax
A lower bound to Wmax can be obtained by considering the Gibbs state ωβ¯ (an equilib￾rium probability distribution which does not vary while a system evolves with time) which
has the same entropy as ρ. Here β is inverse temperature and β¯ is a suitably chosen β. ωβ¯
is given by
ωβ¯ =
1
Z
e
−βH , (16.59)
where Z is a partition function. Then the von Neumann entropy S(ρ) of a density matrix
is S(ρ) = −Tr(ρ ln ρ). There exists a unique value of β = β¯ such that S(ρ) = S(ωβ¯). Then
using the variational principle of statistical mechanics one can prove that
Tr(ρH) −
1
β¯
S(ρ) ≥ Tr(ωβ¯H) −
1
β¯
S(ωβ¯). (16.60)
As S(ρ) = S(ωβ¯) for β = β¯ the above equation gives Tr(ρH) ≥ Tr(ωβ¯H). Equation (16.58)
gives Tr(ρH) > Tr(σρH). Therefore,
Tr(ρH) ≥ Tr(σρH) ≥ Tr(ωβ¯H). (16.61)396 Quantum Technologies
Then from Eqs.(16.58) and (16.61) the bound for Wmax is
Wmax ≤ Tr(ρH) − Tr(ωβ¯H). (16.62)
Generally, the Gibbs state ωβ¯ and the passive state σρ (or ρ) have different eigenvalues and
hence they are different.
4. Ensemble of Batteries
As the product of two independent copies of a passive state is not still passive generally,
it is possible to enhance Wmax by using several copies of a system. Using entangling of many
batteries one can, in general, extract more work per battery from several independent copies
of a battery [112]. Consider an ensemble consisting of n identical d-dimensional batteries.
The Hamiltonian of this new battery is written as H(n) =
Pn
l=1 Hl
. For a single battery
the bound on Wmax is given by Eq. (16.62). For the case of the ensemble of n batteries the

Wmax is given by Eq. (16.58). The given Hamiltonian is
H = Lz [−2|1ih1| − 1|2ih2| + 1|4ih4| + 2|5ih5| ] . (16.64)
Using the given ρ and the orthogonality relations hi|ji = δij , we obtain
Tr(ρH) = LzTr [ ( 0.1|1ih1| + 0.2|2ih2| + 0.3|4ih4| + 0.4|5ih5|)

= Lz(−0.2 − 0.2 + 0.3 + 0.8)

= LzTr [−0.8|1ih1| − 0.3|2ih2| + 0.1|4ih4| ]

The process of charging and discharging the identical batteries (cells) in an ensemble
could introduce quantum correlation among them. The question is whether these correla￾tions offer any quantum advantages to outperform a classical battery. A battery is character￾ized by capacity, power and variance. Capacity refers to the amount of energy a battery can
store and deliver. Power signifies how fast a battery can be charged or discharged. Variance
in the stored energy determines to which extent the stored energy can be deterministically
accessed. For a battery composed of many noninteracting identical quantum cells, correla￾tions play no role as the capacity is additive. On the other hand, intercell correlations offer
certain quantum advantages to power as it is not additive [119].
Theory for random quantum batteries [120], adiabatic protocol for stable charged state
[121], open quantum batteries protocol [122–124] and models of quantum batteries [125–
127] are developed. Role of correlations [128] and numerical analysis of energy flow [129] in
quantum batteries and comparison of quantum batteries with classical versions [130] have
been reported.
Many new quantum devices for applications in quantum information processing such
as quantum gates are being developed. So, developing strategies to store energy to be
consumed by quantum devices has made quantum batteries a significant field of research.
Many different models of quantum batteries have been theoretically proposed. Still devel￾oping quantum batteries for practical applications faces many technological challenges, for
example, the small and sensitive systems like quantum batteries would interact with the
surrounding environment which could dissipate the energy stored.
16.12 Quantum Internet
A long range quantum communication network is one of the most promising applications of
quantum technologies. We have seen in sec. 16.9 how an original qubit can be sent by Alice to
Bob by a process called quantum teleportation making use of entanglement of two quantum
particles. The number of qubits that can be embedded and interconnected in a quantum
device dictates the computational power of that device. But currently available quantum
computing devices operate only with a few tens of qubits. The number of qubits are to be
increased significantly in order to have quantum supremacy over classical computers. The
problem of scaling up the number of qubits can be solved by interconnecting multiple low
qubit devices through a quantum communication network called quantum internet [131–
138]. This network with nodes and quantum links is capable of permitting the parties to do
efficient quantum communications.398 Quantum Technologies
1. Essential Quantum Hardware Elements
There are three essential quantum hardware elements with a quantum internet [136]:
(i) Quantum Channel
It is a physical connection for supporting the qubit transmission. The standard optical
fibers presently used for telecommunication or communication via satellites or combination
of both can be considered as a channel.
(ii) Quantum Repeaters
These are intermediate nodes in a quantum channel for achieving long distance quantum
communication. During the transmission of a photon via a quantum channel absorption and
dephasing lead to loss of quantum of information over distance takes place. To overcome
this loss, quantum repeaters need to be used at regular distances in the quantum channel.
The nodes share entangled connections formulating entangled links.
(iii) Quantum Processors
The end nodes need to have quantum processors to prepare and measure single qubits
for the purpose of large-scale quantum computers. The end nodes can serve as quantum
repeaters also.
2. Long Distance Communication
Quantum internet design is governed by strange quantum phenomena and laws like no￾cloning, measurement collapse, entanglement and teleporting which don’t have classical
analogue. So, the classical internet design cannot be used for design of quantum internet.
For the same reasons, a quantum internet cannot be interconnected to the conventional
classical internet network. Long distance quantum communication is affected by losses and
dephasing errors. To succesfully transmit quantum information between nodes over long
distances, quantum error correction have to be done at repeat stations (nodes) spaced at
regular intervals. A way to send quantum information is to use the technique of teleportation
using quantum entanglement.
3. Quantum Resources
In the classical internet of multiple network for, say, Alice to communicate with Bob an
internet protocol finds an appropriate path or a channel through which the data has to
flow across the multiple networks from Alice to Bob. In a similar way, for achieving quan￾tum communication between Alice and Bob the resources will be provided by the quantum
internet protocol. A resource can be, for example, a secret key for the unconditional se￾cure communication. In the case of quantum teleportation, the resource can be quantum
entanglement.
4. Quantum Repeaters
As photon has weak interaction with environment and can be easily controlled with standard
optical components, it is considered as the most suitable candidate for generating entan￾glement between remote qubits. The photons transport the qubit from a physical quantum
device at the receiver. Direct transmission of quantum information using photon through
a fibre or open space suffers absorption and dephasing limiting the distance to which the
information can be sent to a few hundred kilometers. But entanglement swapping at each
intermediate repeater station allows a long distance quantum communication. The repeaters
have to be entangle in pairs or clusterly to broadcast to all the nodes. Intensive research,
both theoretical and experimental is being done to realize quantum repeaters. Many of theConcluding Remarks 399
building blocks of a quantum repeaters have been experimentally demonstrated [135]. In
the laboratory, the linking of thousands of nodes clusterly has been achieved [139].
A quantum internet can share quantum states among remote nodes and increase the
number of qubits of the interconnected quantum commuting devices. An isolated 10-qubit
device represents 210 states. When two such isolated devices are interconnected with a
quantum internet then the resulting cluster can represent upto 218 states [137]. In this
distributed quantum computing scenario data centres can be interconnected for providing
the specialized quantum equipment and any user can have access to the quantum computing
power through cloud. At present IBM offers facilities to researchers to develop and analyse
quantum algorithm design through a cloud access of isolated quantum devices of 5, 16 and
20 qubits.
5. Quantum Memories
Quantum networks need memories to store quantum information ideally for hours. This
is necessary for both the end users and the quantum repeaters. The repeaters store the
quantum states in their memory for the purpose of selection of a path and path recovery.
The information should be isolated from unwanted interactions with the environment. As
storage of photon is difficult, photonic states are transferred to physical changes like atomic
excitations with high read-write fidelity. Interfaces between photon with quantum states
of trapped ions, ultracold atomic gases, crystalline-solid spin ensembles, superconducting
interference devices and solid state qubits are highly promising quantum memories.
6. Applications
Quantum internet is capable of supporting functionalities such as secure communication,
blind computing, exponential increase of quantum computer power and advanced quantum
sensing techniques. These functionalities of quantum internet have the potential to change
markets and industries such as commerce, inteliigence and military affairs [140]. The best
known application of a quantum internet is quantum key distribution. It enables two remote
nodes to establish a secured encryption key. Quantum internet will help to access remote
quantum computers, secure identification, two-party cryptographic tasks and more accurate
clock synchronization.
Realization of a quantum internet with its possible applications is technically possible.
Important building blocks of quantum internet and experimental small-scale networks have
already been demonstrated. Quantum cryptographic networks have been practically realized
and tested in several countries [140]. A simulator called SimulaQron is introduced for de￾veloping quantum internet software [141]. Various stages of development and advancement
towards a successful quantum internet is discussed in [136]. While a full-scale quantum
computer is technically challenging, developing quantum internet has become a realistic
possibility.
16.13 Concluding Remarks
In the last two decades, quantum science and engineering has created several extremely valu￾able tools operating exclusively under the laws of quantum mechanics and offering practical
optical measurement and characterization techniques that have great advantages over ex￾isting technologies. In addition to various applications discussed in this chapter, quantum
technology has potential for applications in fields like remote sensing, artificial photo syn￾thesis, medical science to photographing tissue layers, infra-red photography, etc. In many400 Quantum Technologies
equipments when generating power a considerable amount of heat energy is produced, for
example, by their motors. Such heat energy can be turned to useful. It is noteworthy to
mention that using quantum interference it is possible to make a molecular thermoelectric
material capable of converting heat energy into electric energy without pollution. Quantum
technology may revolutionize the computer and communication fields. But there are still
number of challenges to be solved in quantum technologies before they come into use in
practical applications.
A great deal of effort has to be put in to develop quantum sensors to exploit the improved
resolution and sensitivity obtained due to quantum entanglement. A major hurdle is the
inability to generate a large number of entangled photons. Because of the low-illumination of
an entangled beam, the sensors may take a long time to record the data and it may become
undesirable for many applications. New materials to record N-photon absorption have to be
found. The decoherence due to environment limits the capability of quantum technology in
many situations. New technologies have to be developed to overcome the problem of noise in
quantum systems. Though many quantum technologies have been successful in laboratories,
it may take still more time to bring them to practical applications.
