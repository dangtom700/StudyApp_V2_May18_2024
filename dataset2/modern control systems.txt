Explicating the structure of feedback control theory, Dorf and Bishop’s Modern Control Systems
aids students in understanding feedback control systems and discusses exciting topics like green 
engineering, human-centered design, and the Internet of Things. The fourteenth edition retains 
the emphasis on design that has historically characterized this book, presenting a clear exposition 
of the basic principles of frequency- and time-domain design techniques.
This book helps students navigate various aspects of the control system design process, 
illustrating these through detailed examples covering applications in robotics, manufacturing, 
medicine, and transportation, among others. Using real-world engineering problems associated 
with designing a controller for a disk drive read system, Modern Control Systems develops a 
Sequential Design Example across chapters. In the same spirit, each chapter presents 
a Continuous Design Problem in which students design a table slide for high-precision 
machinery. Each chapter’s Continuous Design Problem helps students apply the concepts and 
tools of that chapter to address a different design aspect of the overarching design problem.
Ideal for engineering students pursuing senior-level courses as well as for those with no previous 
background in control engineering, the fourteenth edition presents several key features.
• Skills Check questions test students’ knowledge of the chapter material.
• Over 980 end-of-chapter exercises, around 300 of which are new or updated, help 
students strengthen their problem-solving abilities as they work their way from the exercises 
to the design- and computer-based problems.
• A companion website offers several additional resources including the m-files described in 
the book and appendices on z-Transform pairs, matrix algebra, MATLAB, and the LabVIEW 
MathScript RT Module, among others.

MODERN CONTROL SYSTEMS—THE BOOK
Global issues such as climate change, clean water, sustainability, pandemics, waste man￾agement, emissions reduction, and minimizing raw material and energy use have led 
many engineers to re-think existing approaches to engineering design. One outcome 
of the evolving design strategy is to consider green engineering and human-centered 
design. The goal of these approaches to engineering is to design products that mini￾mize pollution, reduce the risk to human health, and improve the living environment. 
Applying the principles of green engineering and human-centered design highlights the 
power of feedback control systems as an enabling technology.
To reduce greenhouse gases and minimize pollution, it is necessary to 
improve both the quality and quantity of our environmental monitoring systems. 
One example is to use wireless measurements on mobile sensing platforms to 
measure the external environment. Another example is to monitor the quality of 
the delivered power to measure leading and lagging power, voltage variations, and 
waveform harmonics. Many green engineering systems and components require 
careful monitoring of current and voltages. For example, current transformers 
are used in various capacities for measuring and monitoring current within the 
power grid network of interconnected systems used to deliver electricity. Sensors 
are key components of any feedback control system because the measurements 
provide the required information as to the state of the system so the control sys￾tem can take the appropriate action.
The role of control systems will continue to expand as the global issues facing 
us require ever increasing levels of automation and precision. In the book, we 
present key examples from green engineering such as wind turbine control and 
modeling of a photovoltaic generator for feedback control to achieve maximum 
power delivery as the sunlight varies over time.
The wind and sun are important sources of renewable energy around the 
world. Wind energy conversion to electric power is achieved by wind energy tur￾bines connected to electric generators. The intermittency characteristic of the 
wind makes smart grid development essential to bring the energy to the power 
grid when it is available and to provide energy from other sources when the wind 
dies down or is disrupted. A smart grid can be viewed as a system comprised of 
hardware and software that routes power more reliably and efficiently to homes, 
businesses, schools, and other users of power in the presence of intermittency 
and other disturbances. The irregular character of wind direction and power also 
results in the need for reliable, steady electric energy by using control systems on 
the wind turbines themselves. The goal of these control devices is to reduce the 
effects of wind intermittency and the effect of wind direction change. Energy stor￾age systems are also critical technologies for green engineering. We seek energy 
storage systems that are renewable, such as fuel cells. Active control can be a key 
element of effective renewable energy storage systems as well.
15
A01_DORF2374_14_GE_FM.indd 15 20/09/21 12:23 PM16 Preface
Another exciting development for control systems is the evolution of the 
Internet of Things—a network of physical objects embedded with electronics, 
software, sensors and connectivity. As envisioned, each of the millions of the 
devices on the network will possess an embedded computer with connectivity 
to the Internet. The ability to control these connected devices will be of great 
interest to control engineers. Indeed, control engineering is an exciting and a 
challenging field. By its very nature, control engineering is a multidisciplinary 
subject, and it has taken its place as a core course in the engineering curriculum. 
It is reasonable to expect different approaches to mastering and practicing the 
art of control engineering. Since the subject has a strong mathematical founda￾tion, we might approach it from a strictly theoretical point of view, emphasizing 
theorems and proofs. On the other hand, since the ultimate objective is to imple￾ment controllers in real systems, we might take an ad hoc approach relying only 
on intuition and hands-on experience when designing feedback control systems. 
Our approach is to present a control engineering methodology that, while based 
on mathematical fundamentals, stresses physical system modeling and practical 
control system designs with realistic system specifications.
We believe that the most important and productive approach to learning is for 
each of us to rediscover and re-create anew the answers and methods of the past. 
Thus, the ideal is to present the student with a series of problems and questions 
and point to some of the answers that have been obtained over the past decades. 
The traditional method—to confront the student not with the problem but with 
the finished solution—is to deprive the student of all excitement, to shut off the 
creative impulse, to reduce the adventure of humankind to a dusty heap of theo￾rems. The issue, then, is to present some of the unanswered and important prob￾lems that we continue to confront, for it may be asserted that what we have truly 
learned and understood, we discovered ourselves.
The purpose of this book is to present the structure of feedback control theory 
and to provide a sequence of exciting discoveries as we proceed through the text 
and problems. If this book is able to assist the student in discovering feedback 
control system theory and practice, it will have succeeded.

THE AUDIENCE
This text is designed for an introductory undergraduate course in control systems 
for engineering students. There is very little demarcation between the various engi￾neering areas in control system practice; therefore, this text is written without any 
conscious bias toward one discipline. Thus, it is hoped that this book will be equally 
useful for all engineering disciplines and, perhaps, will assist in illustrating the utility 
of control engineering. The numerous problems and examples represent all fields, 
and the examples of the sociological, biological, ecological, and economic control sys￾tems are intended to provide the reader with an awareness of the general applicabil￾ity of control theory to many facets of life. We believe that exposing students of one 
discipline to examples and problems from other disciplines will provide them with the 
ability to see beyond their own field of study. Many students pursue careers in engi￾neering fields other than their own. We hope this introduction to control engineering 
will give students a broader understanding of control system design and analysis.
In its first thirteen editions, Modern Control Systems has been used in senior￾level courses for engineering students at many colleges and universities globally. It 
also has been used in courses for engineering graduate students with no previous 
background in control engineering.
THE FOURTEENTH EDITION
With the fourteenth edition, we have created an interactive e-textbook to fully use 
rich, digital content for Modern Control Systems to enhance the learning experience. 
This version contains embedded videos, dynamic graphs, live Skills Check quizzes, 
and active links to additional resources. The electronic version provides a powerful 
interactive experience that would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve in a print 
book.
A companion website is also available to students and faculty using the four￾teenth edition. The website contains many resources, including the m-files in the 
book, Laplace and z-Transform tables, written materials on matrix algebra and 
complex numbers, symbols, units, and conversion factors, and an introduction to 
MATLAB and to the LabVIEW MathScript RT Module. The MCS website is 
available at www.pearsonglobaleditions.com.
We continue the design emphasis that historically has characterized Modern 
Control Systems. Using the real-world engineering problems associated with 
designing a controller for a disk drive read system, we present the Sequential 
Design Example, which is considered sequentially in each chapter using the meth￾ods and concepts in that chapter. Disk drives are used in computers of all sizes 
and they represent an important application of control engineering. Various 
aspects of the design of controllers for the disk drive read system are considered 
in each chapter. For example, in Chapter 1 we identify the control goals, identify 
the variables to be controlled, write the control specifications, and establish the 
preliminary system configuration for the disk drive. Then, in Chapter 2, we obtain 
A01_DORF2374_14_GE_FM.indd 17 20/09/21 12:23 PM18 Preface
models of the process, sensors, and actuators. In the remaining chapters, we con￾tinue the design process, stressing the main points of the chapters.

In the same spirit as the Sequential Design Example, we present a design prob￾lem that we call the Continuous Design Problem to give students the opportunity 
to build upon a design problem from chapter to chapter. High-precision machin￾ery places stringent demands on table slide systems. In the Continuous Design 
Problem, students apply the techniques and tools presented in each chapter to the 
development of a design solution that meets the specified requirements.

The computer-aided design and analysis component of the book continues 
to evolve and improve. Also, many of the solutions to various components of the 
Sequential Design Example utilize m-files with corresponding scripts included in 
the figures.
A Skills Check section is included at the end of each chapter. In each Skills 
Check section, we provide three sets of problems to test your knowledge of the 
chapter material. This includes True or False, Multiple Choice, and Word Match 
problems. To obtain direct feedback, you can check your answers with the answer 
key provided at the conclusion of the end-of-chapter problems.

been developed in the frequency and time domains. An attempt has been made to 
make the selection of topics, as well as the systems discussed in the examples and 
problems, modern in the best sense. Therefore, this book includes discussions on 
robust control systems and system sensitivity, state variable models, controllability 
and observability, computer control systems, internal model control, robust PID 
controllers, and computer-aided design and analysis, to name a few. However, the 
classical topics of control theory that have proved to be so very useful in practice 
have been retained and expanded.
Building Basic Principles: From Classical to Modern. Our goal is to present a clear 
exposition of the basic principles of frequency and time-domain design techniques. 
The classical methods of control engineering are thoroughly covered: Laplace trans￾forms and transfer functions; root locus design; Routh–Hurwitz stability analysis; 
frequency response methods, including Bode, Nyquist, and Nichols; steady-state 
error for standard test signals; second-order system approximations; and phase and 
gain margin and bandwidth. In addition, coverage of the state variable method is 
significant. Fundamental notions of controllability and observability for state vari￾able models are discussed. Full state feedback design with Ackermann’s formula 
for pole placement is presented, along with a discussion on the limitations of state 
variable feedback. Observers are introduced as a means to provide state estimates 
when the complete state is not measured.
Upon this strong foundation of basic principles, the book provides many oppor￾tunities to explore topics beyond the traditional. In the latter chapters, we present 
introductions into more advanced topics of robust control and digital control, as 
well as an entire chapter devoted to the design of feedback control systems with a 
focus on practical industrial lead and lag compensator structures. Problem solving 
is emphasized throughout the chapters. Each chapter (but the first) introduces the 
student to the notion of computer-aided design and analysis.
Progressive Development of Problem-Solving Skills. Reading the chapters, 
attending lectures and taking notes, and working through the illustrated examples 
are all part of the learning process. But the real test comes at the end of the chapter 
with the problems. The book takes the issue of problem solving seriously. In each 
chapter, there are five problem types:
❏ Exercises
❏ Problems
❏ Advanced Problems
❏ Design Problems
❏ Computer Problems
For example, the problem set for Mathematical Models of Systems, Chapter 2 
includes 31 exercises, 51 problems, 9 advanced problems, 6 design problems, and 
A01_DORF2374_14_GE_FM.indd 19 20/09/21 12:23 PM20 Preface
10 computer-based problems. The exercises permit the students to readily utilize the 
concepts and methods introduced in each chapter by solving relatively straightfor￾ward exercises before attempting the more complex problems. The problems require 
an extension of the concepts of the chapter to new situations. The advanced prob￾lems represent problems of increasing complexity. The design problems emphasize 
the design task; the computer-based problems give the student practice with prob￾lem solving using computers. In total, the book contains more than 980 problems. 
The abundance of problems of increasing complexity gives students confidence in 
their problem solving ability as they work their way from the exercises to the design 
and computer-based problems. An instructor’s manual, available to all adopters of 
the text for course use, contains complete solutions to all end-of-chapter problems.
A set of m-files, the Modern Control Systems Toolbox, has been developed 
by the authors to supplement the text. The m-files contain the scripts from each 
computer-based example in the text. You may retrieve the m-files from the com￾panion available at www.pearsonglobaleditions.com.
Design Emphasis without Compromising Basic Principles. The all-important 
topic of design of real-world, complex control systems is a major theme through￾out the text. Emphasis on design for real-world applications addresses interest in 
design by ABET and industry.
The design process consists of seven main building blocks that we arrange into 
three groups:
1. Establishment of goals and variables to be controlled, and definition of speci￾fications (metrics) against which to measure performance
2. System definition and modeling
3. Control system design and integrated system simulation and analysis
In each chapter of this book, we highlight the connection between the design 
process and the main topics of that chapter. The objective is to demonstrate differ￾ent aspects of the design process through illustrative examples.
Various aspects of the control system design process are illustrated in detail 
in many examples across all the chapters, including applications of control design 
in robotics, manufacturing, medicine, and transportation (ground, air, and space).
Each chapter includes a section to assist students in utilizing computer-aided 
design and analysis concepts and in reworking many of the design examples. 
Generally, m-files scripts are provided that can be used in the design and analyses 
of the feedback control systems. Each script is annotated with comment boxes 
that highlight important aspects of the script. The accompanying output of the 
script (generally a graph) also contains comment boxes pointing out significant 
elements. The scripts can also be utilized with modifications as the foundation for 
solving other related problems.
Learning Enhancement. Each chapter begins with a chapter preview describing 
the topics the student can expect to encounter. The chapters conclude with an 
end-of-chapter summary, skills check, as well as terms and concepts. These sections 
A01_DORF2374_14_GE_FM.indd 20 20/09/21 12:23 PMPreface 21
reinforce the important concepts introduced in the chapter and serve as a refer￾ence for later use.
Color is used to add emphasis when needed and to make the graphs and fig￾ures easier to interpret. For example, consider the computer control of a robot to 
spray-paint an automobile. We might ask the student to investigate the closed-loop 
system stability for various values of the controller gain K and to determine the 
response to a unit step disturbance, Td ( )s = 1 s, when the input R s( ) = 0. The 
associated figure assists the student with (a) visualizing the problem, and (b) taking 
the next step to develop the transfer function model and to complete the analyses.

PREVIEW
A control system consists of interconnected components to achieve a desired 
purpose. In this chapter, we discuss open- and closed-loop feedback control systems. 
We examine examples of control systems through the course of history. Early 
systems incorporated many of the basic ideas of feedback that are employed in 
modern control systems. A design process is presented that encompasses the estab￾lishment of goals and variables to be controlled, definition of specifications, system 
definition, modeling, and analysis. The iterative nature of design allows us to handle 
the design gap effectively while accomplishing necessary trade-offs in complexity, 
performance, and cost. Finally, we introduce the Sequential Design Example: Disk 
Drive Read System. This example will be considered sequentially in each chapter of 
this book. It represents a practical control system design problem while simultane￾ously serving as a useful learning tool.
DESIRED OUTCOMES
Upon completion of Chapter 1, students should be able to:
❏ Give illustrative examples of control systems and describe their relationship to key 
contemporary issues.
❏ Recount a brief history of control systems and their role in society.
❏ Predict the future of controls in the context of their evolutionary pathways.
❏ Recognize the elements of control system design and possess an appreciation of 
appreciate controls in the context of engineering design.

1.1 INTRODUCTION
Engineers create products that help people. Our quality of life is sustained and 
enhanced through engineering. To accomplish this, engineers strive to understand, 
model, and control the materials and forces of nature for the benefit of humankind. 
A key area of engineering that reaches across many technical areas is the multi￾disciplinary field of control system engineering. Control engineers are concerned 
with understanding and controlling segments of their environment, often called 
systems, which are interconnections of elements and devices for a desired purpose. 
The system might be something as clear-cut as an automobile cruise control sys￾tem, or as extensive and complex as a direct brain-to-computer system to control 
a manipulator. Control engineering deals with the design (and implementation) 
of control systems using linear, time-invariant mathematical models representing 
actual physical nonlinear, time-varying systems with parameter uncertainties in the 
presence of external disturbances. As computer systems—especially embedded 
processors—have become less expensive, require less power and space, while grow￾ing more computationally powerful, at the same time that sensors and actuators 
have simultaneously experienced the same evolution to more capability in smaller 
packages, the application of control systems has grown in number and complexity. 
A sensor is a device that provides a measurement of a desired external signal. For 
example, resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) are sensors used to measure 
temperature. An actuator is a device employed by the control system to alter or 
adjust the environment. An electric motor drive used to rotate a robotic manipu￾lator is an example of a device transforming electric energy to mechanical torque.
The face of control engineering is rapidly changing. The age of the 
Internet of Things (IoT) presents many intriguing challenges in control system 
applications in the environment (think about more efficient energy use in homes 
and businesses), manufacturing (think 3D printing), consumer products, energy, 
medical devices and healthcare, transportation (think about automated cars!), 
among many others [14]. A challenge for control engineers today is to be able 
to create simple, yet reliable and accurate mathematical models of many of our 
modern, complex, interrelated, and interconnected systems. Fortunately, many 
modern design tools are available, as well as open source software modules and 
Internet-based user groups (to share ideas and answer questions), to assist the 
modeler. The implementation of the control systems themselves is also becom￾ing more automated, again assisted by many resources readily available on the 
Internet coupled with access to relatively inexpensive computers, sensors, and 
actuators. Control system engineering focuses on the modeling of a wide assort￾ment of physical systems and using those models to design controllers that will 
cause the closed-loop systems to possess desired performance characteristics, 
such as stability, relative stability, steady-state tracking with prescribed maxi￾mum errors, transient tracking (percent overshoot, settling time, rise time, and 
time to peak), rejection of external disturbances, and robustness to modeling 
uncertainties. The extremely important step of the overall design and implemen￾tation process is designing the control systems, such as PID controllers, lead and 
lag controllers, state variable feedback controllers, and other popular controller 
structures. That is what this textbook is all about!
M01_DORF2374_14_GE_C01.indd 30 13/09/2021 14:17Section 1.1 Introduction 31
Control system engineering is based on the foundations of feedback theory 
and linear system analysis, and it integrates the concepts of network theory and 
communication theory. It is founded on a strong mathematical foundation, yet is 
very practical and impacts our lives every day in almost all we do. Indeed, control 
engineering is not limited to any engineering discipline but is equally applicable to 
aerospace, agricultural, biomedical, chemical, civil, computer, industrial, electrical, 
environmental, mechanical, nuclear engineering, and even computer science. Many 
aspects of control engineering can also be found in studies in systems engineering.
A control system is an interconnection of components forming a system con￾figuration that will provide a desired system response. The basis for analysis of a 
system is the foundation provided by linear system theory, which assumes a cause–
effect relationship for the components of a system. A component, or process, to be 
controlled can be represented graphically, as shown in Figure 1.1. The input–output 
relationship represents the cause-and-effect relationship of the process, which in 
turn represents a processing of the input signal to provide a desired output signal. 
An open-loop control system uses a controller and an actuator to obtain the desired 
response, as shown in Figure 1.2. An open-loop system is a system without feedback.

FIGURE 1.3
Closed-loop 
feedback control 
system (with 
feedback).
An open-loop control system utilizes an actuating device to control the process 
directly without using feedback.
In contrast to an open-loop control system, a closed-loop control system utilizes 
an additional measure of the actual output to compare the actual output with the 
desired output response. The measure of the output is called the feedback signal. 
A simple closed-loop feedback control system is shown in Figure 1.3. A feedback 
control system is a control system that tends to maintain a prescribed relationship of 
one system variable to another by comparing functions of these variables and using 
the difference as a means of control. With an accurate sensor, the measured output 
is a good approximation of the actual output of the system.
M01_DORF2374_14_GE_C01.indd 31 13/09/2021 14:1732 Chapter 1 Introduction to Control Systems
A feedback control system often uses a function of a prescribed relationship 
between the output and reference input to control the process. Often the difference 
between the output of the process under control and the reference input is ampli￾fied and used to control the process so that the difference is continually reduced. In 
general, the difference between the desired output and the actual output is equal 
to the error, which is then adjusted by the controller. The output of the control￾ler causes the actuator to modulate the process in order to reduce the error. For 
example, if a ship is heading incorrectly to the right, the rudder is actuated to direct 
the ship to the left. The system shown in Figure 1.3 is a negative feedback control 
system, because the output is subtracted from the input and the difference is used as 
the input signal to the controller. The feedback concept is the foundation for con￾trol system analysis and design.

Closed-loop 
feedback system 
with external 
disturbances and

A closed-loop control system uses a measurement of the output and feedback 
of this signal to compare it with the desired output (reference or command).
A closed-loop control has many advantages over open-loop control, including 
the ability to reject external disturbances and improve measurement noise attenua￾tion. We incorporate disturbances and measurement noise in the block diagram as 
external inputs, as illustrated in Figure 1.4. External disturbances and measurement 
noise are inevitable in real-world applications and must be addressed in practical 
control system designs.
The feedback systems in Figures 1.3 and 1.4 are single-loop feedback systems. 
Many feedback control systems contain more than one feedback loop. A common 
multiloop feedback control system is illustrated in Figure 1.5 with an inner loop 
and an outer loop. In this scenario, the inner loop has a controller and a sensor and 
the outer loop has a controller and sensor. Other varieties of multiloop feedback 
systems are considered throughout the book as they represent more practical situ￾ations found in real-world applications. However, we use the single-loop feedback 
system for learning about the benefits of feedback control systems since the out￾comes readily scale to multiloop systems.
Due to the increasing complexity of systems under active control and the inter￾est in achieving optimum performance, the importance of control system engineering 
continues to grow. Furthermore, as the systems become more complex, the interre￾lationship of many controlled variables must be considered in the control scheme. 
A block diagram depicting a multivariable control system is shown in Figure 1.6.
M01_DORF2374_14_GE_C01.indd 32 13/09/2021 14:17Section 1.2 Brief History of Automatic Control 33
A common example of an open-loop control system is a microwave oven set 
to operate for a fixed time. An example of a closed-loop control system is a person 
steering an automobile (assuming his or her eyes are open) by looking at the auto’s 
location on the road and making the appropriate adjustments.
The introduction of feedback enables us to control a desired output and can 
improve accuracy, but it requires attention to the issues of stability and performance. 
1.2 BRIEF HISTORY OF AUTOMATIC CONTROL
The use of feedback to control a system has a fascinating history. The first applications 
of feedback control appeared in the development of float regulator mechanisms 
in Greece in the period 300 to 1 b.c. [1, 2, 3]. The water clock of Ktesibios used 
a float regulator. An oil lamp devised by Philon in approximately 250 b.c. used a 
float regulator in an oil lamp for maintaining a constant level of fuel oil. Heron of 
Alexandria, who lived in the first century a.d., published a book entitled Pneumatica, 
which outlined several forms of water-level mechanisms using float regulators [1].
The first feedback system to be invented in modern Europe was the tem￾perature regulator of Cornelis Drebbel (1572–1633) of Holland [1]. Dennis Papin 
(1647–1712) invented the first pressure regulator for steam boilers in 1681. Papin’s 
pressure regulator was a form of safety regulator similar to a pressure-cooker valve.

M01_DORF2374_14_GE_C01.indd 33 13/09/2021 14:1734 Chapter 1 Introduction to Control Systems
The first automatic feedback controller used in an industrial process is gener￾ally agreed to be James Watt’s flyball governor, developed in 1769 for controlling 
the speed of a steam engine [1, 2]. The all-mechanical device, illustrated in Figure 
1.7, measured the speed of the output shaft and utilized the movement of the 
flyball to control the steam valve and therefore the amount of steam entering 
the engine. As depicted in Figure 1.7, the governor shaft axis is connected via 
mechanical linkages and beveled gears to the output shaft of the steam engine. 
As the steam engine output shaft speed increases, the ball weights rise and move 
away from the shaft axis and through mechanical linkages the steam valve closes 
and the engine slows down.
The first historical feedback system is the water-level float regulator said to 
have been invented by I. Polzunov in 1765 [4]. The level regulator system is illus￾trated in Figure 1.8. The float detects the water level and controls the valve that 
covers the water inlet in the boiler.
The next century was characterized by the development of automatic con￾trol systems through intuition and invention. Efforts to increase the accuracy of 
the control system led to slower attenuation of the transient oscillations and even 
to unstable systems. It then became imperative to develop a theory of automatic 
control. In 1868, J. C. Maxwell formulated a mathematical theory related to con￾trol theory using a differential equation model of a governor [5]. Maxwell’s study 
was concerned with the effect various system parameters had on the system perfor￾mance. During the same period, I. A. Vyshnegradskii formulated a mathematical 
theory of regulators [6].
Prior to World War II, control theory and practice developed differently in the 
United States and western Europe than in Russia and eastern Europe. The main

impetus for the use of feedback in the United States was the development of the 
telephone system and electronic feedback amplifiers by Bode, Nyquist, and Black 
at Bell Telephone Laboratories [7–10, 12].
Harold S. Black graduated from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1921 
and joined Bell Laboratories of American Telegraph and Telephone (AT&T). 
At that time, the major task confronting Bell Laboratories was the improve￾ment of the telephone system and the design of improved signal amplifiers. 
Black was assigned the task of linearizing, stabilizing, and improving the ampli￾fiers that were used in tandem to carry conversations over distances of several 
thousand miles. After years of working on oscillator circuits, Black had the 
idea of negative feedback amplifiers as a way to avoid self-oscillations. His idea 
would enhance the stability of circuit stability over a wide range of frequency 
bands [8].
The frequency domain was used primarily to describe the operation of the feed￾back amplifiers in terms of bandwidth and other frequency variables. In contrast, 
the eminent mathematicians and applied mechanicians in the former Soviet Union 
inspired and dominated the field of control theory. The Russian theory tended to 
utilize a time-domain formulation using differential equations.
The control of an industrial process (manufacturing, production, and so on) 
by automatic rather than manual means is often called automation. Automation 
is prevalent in the chemical, electric power, paper, automobile, and steel in￾dustries, among others. The concept of automation is central to our industrial 
society. Automatic machines are used to increase the production of a plant. 
Industries are concerned with the productivity per worker of their plants. 
Productivity is defined as the ratio of physical output to physical input [26]. In 
this case, we are referring to labor productivity, which is real output per hour of 
work.
A large impetus to the theory and practice of automatic control occurred 
during World War II when it became necessary to design and construct auto￾matic airplane piloting, gun-positioning systems, radar antenna control sys￾tems, and other military systems based on the feedback control approach.

The complexity and expected performance of these military systems necessitated 
an extension of the available control techniques and fostered interest in control 
systems and the development of new insights and methods. Prior to 1940, for 
most cases, the design of control systems was an art involving a trial-and-error 
approach. During the 1940s, mathematical and analytical methods increased in 
number and utility, and control engineering became an engineering discipline in 
its own right [10–12].
Another example of the discovery of an engineering solution to a control sys￾tem problem was the creation of a gun director by David B. Parkinson of Bell 
Telephone Laboratories. In the spring of 1940, Parkinson was intent on improv￾ing the automatic level recorder, an instrument that used strip-chart paper to plot 
the record of a voltage. A critical component was a small potentiometer used to 
control the pen of the recorder through an actuator. If a potentiometer could be 
used to control the pen on a level recorder, might it be capable of controlling other 
machines such as an antiaircraft gun? [13].
After considerable effort, an engineering model was delivered for testing to the 
U.S. Army on December 1, 1941. Production models were available by early 1943, 
and eventually 3000 gun controllers were delivered. Input to the controller was pro￾vided by radar, and the gun was aimed by taking the data of the airplane’s present 
position and calculating the target’s future position.
Frequency-domain techniques continued to dominate the field of control fol￾lowing World War II with the increased use of the Laplace transform and the com￾plex frequency plane. During the 1950s, the emphasis in control engineering the￾ory was on the development and use of the s-plane methods and, particularly, the 
root locus approach. Furthermore, during the 1980s, the use of digital computers 
for control components became routine. The technology of these new control ele￾ments to perform accurate and rapid calculations was formerly unavailable to con￾trol engineers. These computers are now employed especially for process control 
systems in which many variables are measured and controlled simultaneously by 
the computer.
With the advent of Sputnik and the space age, another new impetus was im￾parted to control engineering. It became necessary to design complex, highly 
accurate control systems for missiles and space probes. Furthermore, the ne￾cessity to minimize the weight of satellites and to control them very accurately 
has spawned the important field of optimal control. Due to these requirements, 
the time-domain methods developed by Liapunov, Minorsky, and others have 
been met with great interest. Theories of optimal control developed by L.  S. 
Pontryagin in the former Soviet Union and R. Bellman in the United States, as 
well as studies of robust systems, have contributed to the interest in time-domain 
methods. Control engineering must consider both the time-domain and the fre￾quency-domain approaches simultaneously in the analysis and design of control 
systems.
A notable advance with worldwide impact is the U.S. space-based radionaviga￾tion system known as the Global Positioning System or GPS [82–85]. In the distant 
M01_DORF2374_14_GE_C01.indd 36 13/09/2021 14:17Section 1.2 Brief History of Automatic Control 37
past, various strategies and sensors were developed to keep explorers on the oceans 
from getting lost, including following coastlines, using compasses to point north, and 
sextants to measure the angles of stars, the moon, and the sun above the horizon. The 
early explorers were able to estimate latitude accurately, but not longitude. It was not 
until the 1700s with the development of the chronometer that, when used with the 
sextant, the longitude could be estimated. Radio-based navigation systems began to 
appear in the early twentieth century and were used in World War II. With the advent 
of Sputnik and the space age, it became known that radio signals from satellites could 
be used to navigate on the ground by observing the Doppler shift of the received 
radio signals. Research and development culminated in the 1990s with 24 navigation 
satellites (known as the GPS) that solved the fundamental problem that explorers 
faced for centuries by providing a dependable mechanism to pinpoint the current lo￾cation. Freely available on a continuous worldwide basis, GPS provides very reliable 
location and time information anytime, day or night, anywhere in the world. Using 
GPS as a sensor to provide position (and velocity) information is a mainstay of ac￾tive control systems for transportation systems in the air, on the ground, and on the 
oceans. The GPS assists relief and emergency workers to save lives, and helps us with 
our everyday activities including the control of power grids, banking, farming, survey￾ing, and many other tasks.
Global navigation satellite services (such as GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo) 
providing position, navigation, and timing data coupled with evolving wireless 
mobile technology, highly capable mobile computing systems and devices, global 
geographic information systems, and semantic web are supporting the evolving 
field of ubiquitous positioning [100-103]. These systems can provide information 
on the location of people, vehicles, and other objects as a function of time across 
the globe. As personal ubiquitous computing [104] contiues to push active control 
technology to the edge where the action is taking place, we will be faced with 
many opportunities to design and field autonomous systems based on the firm 
ground of system theoretic concepts covered in this introductory text on modern 
control systems.
The evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) is having a transformational 
impact on the field of control engineering. The idea of the IoT, first proposed 
by Kevin Ashton in 1999, is the network of physical objects embedded with elec￾tronics, software, sensors, and connectivity—all elements of control engineer￾ing [14]. Each of the “things” on the network has an embedded computer with 
connectivity to the Internet. The ability to control connected devices is of great 
interest to control engineers, but there remains much work to be done, especially 
in establishing standards [24]. The International Data Corporation estimates that 
there will be 41.6 billion IoT devices generating 79.4 zettabytes (ZB) of data by 
the year 2025 [106]. One ZB is equal to one trillion GB! Figure 1.9 presents a 
technology roadmap that illustrates that in the near future control engineering is 
likely to play a role in creating active control applications for connected devices 
(adopted from [27]).
A selected history of control system development is summarized in Table 1.1.

1.3 EXAMPLES OF CONTROL SYSTEMS
Control engineering is concerned with the analysis and design of goal-oriented 
systems. Therefore the mechanization of goal-oriented policies has grown into a hi￾erarchy of goal-oriented control systems. Modern control theory is concerned with 
systems that have self-organizing, adaptive, robust, learning, and optimum qualities.
EXAMPLE 1.1 Automated vehicles
Driving an automobile is a pleasant task when the auto responds rapidly to the driver’s 
commands. The era of autonomous or self-driving vehicles is almost upon us [15, 19, 
20]. The autonomous vehicle must be able to sense the changing environment, perform 
trajectory planning, prescribe the control inputs that include steering and turning, ac￾celerating and braking, and many other functions typically handled by the driver, and 
actually implement the control strategy. Steering is one of the critical functions of au￾tonomous vehicles. A simple block diagram of an automobile steering control system 
is shown in Figure 1.10(a). The desired course is compared with a measurement of the 
actual course in order to generate a measure of the error, as shown in Figure 1.10(b). 
This measurement is obtained by visual and tactile (body movement) feedback, as pro￾vided by the feel of the steering wheel by the hand (sensor). This feedback system is 
a familiar version of the steering control system in an ocean liner or the flight controls 
in a large airplane. A typical direction-of-travel response is shown in Figure 1.10(c). ■

EXAMPLE 1.2 Human-in-the-loop control
A basic, manually controlled closed-loop system for regulating the level of fluid in a 
tank is shown in Figure 1.11. The input is a reference level of fluid that the operator 
is instructed to maintain. (This reference is memorized by the operator.) The power 
amplifier is the operator, and the sensor is visual. The operator compares the actual 
level with the desired level and opens or closes the valve (actuator), adjusting the 
fluid flow out, to maintain the desired level. ■

worker has been foreseen by several authors. In his famous 1923 play, entitled

R.U.R. [48], Karel Capek called artificial workers robots, deriving the word from 
the Czech noun robota, meaning “work.”
A robot is a computer-controlled machine and involves technology closely 
associated with automation. Industrial robotics can be defined as a particular field of 
automation in which the automated machine (that is, the robot) is designed to substi￾tute for human labor [18, 33]. Thus robots possess certain humanlike characteristics. 
Today, the most common humanlike characteristic is a mechanical manipulator 
that is patterned somewhat after the human arm and wrist. Some devices even have 
anthropomorphic mechanisms, including what we might recognize as mechanical 
arms, wrists, and hands [28]. An example of an anthropomorphic robot is shown in 
Figure 1.12. We recognize that the automatic machine is well suited to some tasks, 
as noted in Table 1.2, and that other tasks are best carried out by humans [106]. ■
EXAMPLE 1.4 Electric power industry
There has been considerable discussion recently concerning the gap between practice 
and theory in control engineering. However, it is natural that theory precedes the 
applications in many fields of control engineering. Nonetheless, it is interesting to 
note that in the electric power industry, the largest industry in the United States, 
the gap is relatively insignificant. The electric power industry is primarily interested 
in energy conversion, control, and distribution. It is critical that computer control 
be increasingly applied to the power industry in order to improve the efficient use 
of energy resources. Also, the control of power plants for minimum waste emis￾sion has become increasingly important. The modern, large-capacity plants, which 
exceed several hundred megawatts, require automatic control systems that account 
for the interrelationship of the process variables and optimum power production. 
It is common to have 90 or more manipulated variables under coordinated con￾trol. A simplified model showing several of the important control variables of a 
large boiler–generator system is shown in Figure 1.13. This is an example of the 
importance of measuring many variables, such as pressure and oxygen, to provide 
information to the computer for control calculations. ■
The electric power industry has used the modern aspects of control engineering 
for significant and interesting applications. It appears that in the process industry, 
the factor that maintains the applications gap is the lack of instrumentation to mea￾sure all the important process variables, including the quality and composition of 
M01_DORF2374_14_GE_C01.indd 41 13/09/2021 14:1742 Chapter 1 Introduction to Control Systems
the product. As these instruments become available, the applications of modern 
control theory to industrial systems should increase measurably.
EXAMPLE 1.5 Biomedical engineering
There have been many applications of control system theory to biomedical 
experimentation, diagnosis, prosthetics, and biological control systems [22, 23, 48]. The 
control systems under consideration range from the cellular level to the central ner￾vous system and include temperature regulation and neurological, respiratory, and 
cardiovascular control. Most physiological control systems are closed-loop systems. 
However, we find not one controller but rather control loop within control loop, 
forming a hierarchy of systems. The modeling of the structure of biological processes 
confronts the analyst with a high-order model and a complex structure. Prosthetic 
devices aid millions of people worldwide. Recent advances in feedback control

technology will profoundly transform the lives of amputees and people living with 
paralysis. Much progress has been made in the restoration of sensation of touch and 
pain and in connecting prosthetic limb sensors with haptic feedback directly back 
to the brain. Figure 1.14 depicts a prosthetic had and arm with the same dexterity 
as a human arm. Especially fascinating are advances in brain-controlled feedback 
of prosthetic limbs enabling the power of the human brain to guide the movement 
[39]. Another fascinating advance in the development of prosthetic limbs is to make 
possible the sense of touch and pain [22]. Much progress has been made in the res￾toration of sensation of touch and pain and in connecting sensors to the prosthetic 
limbs with haptic feedback directly back to the brain. ■
EXAMPLE 1.6 Social, economic, and political systems
It is interesting and valuable to attempt to model the feedback processes preva￾lent in the social, economic, and political spheres. This approach is undeveloped at 
present but appears to have a bright future. Society is composed of many feedback 
systems and regulatory bodies, which are controllers exerting the forces on society 
necessary to maintain a desired output. A simple lumped model of the national 
income feedback control system is shown in Figure 1.15. This type of model helps 
the analyst to understand the effects of government control and the dynamic ef￾fects of government spending. Of course, many other loops not shown also exist, 
since, theoretically, government spending cannot exceed the tax collected without 
generating a deficit, which is itself a control loop containing the Internal Revenue 
Service and the Congress. In a socialist country, the loop due to consumers is de￾emphasized and government control is emphasized. In that case, the measurement

model, while usually nonrigorous, does impart information and understanding. ■
EXAMPLE 1.7 Unmanned aerial vehicles
The ongoing area of research and development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) 
is full of potential for the application of control systems. These aircrafts are also known 
as drones. An example of a drone is shown in Figure 1.16. Drones are unmanned but 
are usually controlled by ground operators. Typically they do not operate autono￾mously, and their inability to provide the level of safety required in a complex airspace 
keeps them from flying freely in the commercial airspace although package delivery 
via drones has begun. One significant challenge is to develop control systems that will 
avoid in-air collisions. Ultimately, the goal is to employ the drone autonomously in 
M01_DORF2374_14_GE_C01.indd 44 13/09/2021 14:17Section 1.3 Examples of Control Systems 45

such applications as aerial photography to assist in disaster mitigation, survey work 
to assist in construction projects, crop monitoring, and continuous weather monitor￾ing. An intriguing emerging area of applied research is the integration of artificial 
intelligence (AI) and drones [74]. Smart unmanned aircraft will require significant 
deployment of advanced control systems throughout the airframe. ■
EXAMPLE 1.8 Industrial control systems
Other familiar control systems have the same basic elements as the system shown in 
Figure 1.3. A refrigerator has a temperature setting or desired temperature, a thermostat 
to measure the actual temperature and the error, and a compressor motor for power 
amplification. Other examples in the home are the oven, furnace, and water heater. 
In industry, there are many examples, including speed controls; process temperature and 
pressure controls; and position, thickness, composition, and quality controls [17, 18].
Feedback control systems are used extensively in industrial applications. 
Thousands of industrial and laboratory robots are currently in use. Manipulators can 
pick up objects weighing hundreds of pounds and position them with an accuracy 
of one-tenth of an inch or better [28]. Automatic handling equipment for home, 
school, and industry is particularly useful for hazardous, repetitious, dull, or simple 
tasks. Machines that automatically load and unload, cut, weld, or cast are used by 
industry to obtain accuracy, safety, economy, and productivity [28, 41].
Another important industry, the metallurgical industry, has had considerable 
success in automatically controlling its processes. In fact, in many cases, the control 
theory is being fully implemented. For example, a hot-strip steel mill is controlled 
for temperature, strip width, thickness, and quality.
There has been considerable interest recently in applying the feedback control 
concepts to automatic warehousing and inventory control. Furthermore, automatic 
control of agricultural systems (farms) is receiving increased interest. Automatically 
controlled silos and tractors have been developed and tested. Automatic control of 
wind turbine generators, solar heating and cooling, and automobile engine perfor￾mance are important modern examples [20, 21]. ■

1.4 ENGINEERING DESIGN
Engineering design is the central task of the engineer. It is a complex process in 
which both creativity and analysis play major roles.
Design is the process of conceiving or inventing the forms, parts, and details of 
a system to achieve a specified purpose.
Design activity can be thought of as planning for the emergence of a particular 
product or system. Design is an innovative act whereby the engineer creatively 
uses knowledge and materials to specify the shape, function, and material con￾tent of a system. The design steps are (1) to determine a need arising from the 
values of various groups, covering the spectrum from public policy makers to the 
consumer; (2) to specify in detail what the solution to that need must be and to 
embody these values; (3) to develop and evaluate various alternative solutions to 
meet these specifications; and (4) to decide which one is to be designed in detail 
and fabricated.
An important factor in realistic design is the limitation of time. Design takes place 
under imposed schedules, and we eventually settle for a design that may be less than ideal 
but considered “good enough.” In many cases, time is the only competitive advantage.
A major challenge for the designer is writing the specifications for the technical 
product. Specifications are statements that explicitly state what the device or product is 
to be and do. The design of technical systems aims to provide appropriate design spec￾ifications and rests on four characteristics: complexity, trade-offs, design gaps, and risk.
Complexity of design results from the wide range of tools, issues, and knowledge 
to be used in the process. The large number of factors to be considered illustrates 
the complexity of the design specification activity, not only in assigning these fac￾tors their relative importance in a particular design, but also in giving them sub￾stance either in numerical or written form, or both.
The concept of trade-off involves the need to resolve conflicting design goals, 
all of which are desirable. The design process requires an efficient compromise 
between desirable but conflicting criteria.
In making a technical device, we generally find that the final product does not 
appear as originally visualized. For example, our image of the problem we are solv￾ing does not appear in written description and ultimately in the specifications. Such 
design gaps are intrinsic in the progression from an abstract idea to its realization.
This inability to be absolutely sure about predictions of the performance of a tech￾nological object leads to major uncertainties about the actual effects of the designed 
devices and products. These uncertainties are embodied in the idea of unintended con￾sequences or risk. The result is that designing a system is a risk-taking activity.
Complexity, trade-off, gaps, and risk are inherent in designing new systems and 
devices. Although they can be minimized by considering all the effects of a given 
design, they are always present in the design process.
Within engineering design, there is a fundamental difference between the two 
major types of thinking that must take place: engineering analysis and synthesis. 
Attention is focused on models of the physical systems that are analyzed to provide 
M01_DORF2374_14_GE_C01.indd 46 13/09/2021 14:17Section 1.5 Control System Design 47
insight and that indicate directions for improvement. On the other hand, synthesis is 
the process by which these new physical configurations are created.
Design is a process that may proceed in many directions before the desired one 
is found. It is a deliberate process by which a designer creates something new in 
response to a recognized need while recognizing realistic constraints. The design 
process is inherently iterative—we must start somewhere! Successful engineers 
learn to simplify complex systems appropriately for design and analysis purposes. 
A gap between the complex physical system and the design model is inevitable. 
Design gaps are intrinsic in the progression from the initial concept to the final 
product. We know intuitively that it is easier to improve an initial concept incre￾mentally than to try to create a final design at the start. In other words, engineering 
design is not a linear process. It is an iterative, nonlinear, creative process.
The main approach to the most effective engineering design is parameter 
analysis and optimization. Parameter analysis is based on (1) identification of the 
key parameters, (2) generation of the system configuration, and (3) evaluation of 
how well the configuration meets the needs. These three steps form an iterative 
loop. Once the key parameters are identified and the configuration synthesized, the 
designer can optimize the parameters. Typically, the designer strives to identify a 
limited set of parameters to be adjusted.
1.5 CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN
The design of control systems is a specific example of engineering design. The goal 
of control engineering design is to obtain the configuration, specifications, and 
identification of the key parameters of a proposed system to meet an actual need.
The control system design process is illustrated in Figure 1.17. The design pro￾cess consists of seven main building blocks, which we arrange into three groups:
1. Establishment of goals and variables to be controlled, and definition of specifications 
(metrics) against which to measure performance.
2. System definition and modeling.
3. Control system design and integrated system simulation and analysis.
In each chapter of this book, we will highlight the connection between the 
design process illustrated in Figure 1.17 and the main topics of that chapter. The 
objective is to demonstrate different aspects of the design process through illustra￾tive examples. We have established the following connections between the chapters 
in this book and the design process block diagram:
1. Establishment of goals, control variables, and specifications: Chapters 1, 3, 4, and 13.
2. System definition and modeling: Chapters 2–4, and 11–13.
3. Control system design, simulation, and analysis: Chapters 4–13.
The first step in the design process consists of establishing the system goals. 
For example, we may state that our goal is to control the velocity of a motor ac￾curately. The second step is to identify the variables that we desire to control (for 
example, the velocity of the motor). The third step is to write the specifications in 
terms of the accuracy we must attain. This required accuracy of control will then lead 
M01_DORF2374_14_GE_C01.indd 47 13/09/2021 14:1748 Chapter 1 Introduction to Control Systems
to the identification of a sensor to measure the controlled variable. The performance 
specifications will describe how the closed-loop system should perform and will in￾clude (1) good regulation against disturbances, (2) desirable responses to commands, 
(3) realistic actuator signals, (4) low sensitivities, and (5) robustness.
As designers, we proceed to the first attempt to configure a system that will result 
in the desired control performance. This system configuration will normally consist of a 
sensor, the process under control, an actuator, and a controller, as shown in Figure 1.3. 
The next step consists of identifying a candidate for the actuator. This will, of course, 
depend on the process, but the actuation chosen must be capable of effectively adjusting 
the performance of the process. For example, if we wish to control the speed of a rotating 
flywheel, we will select a motor as the actuator. The sensor, in this case, must be capable 
of accurately measuring the speed. We then obtain a model for each of these elements.
Students studying controls are often given the models, frequently represented in 
transfer function or state variable form, with the understanding that they represent the 
underlying physical systems, but without further explanation. An obvious question is, 
where did the transfer function or state variable model come from? Within the context

of a course in control systems, there is a need to address key questions surrounding 
modeling. To that end, in the early chapters, we will provide insight into key modeling 
concerns and answer fundamental questions: How is the transfer function obtained? 
What basic assumptions are implied in the model development? How general are the 
transfer functions? However, mathematical modeling of physical systems is a subject in 
and of itself. We cannot hope to cover the mathematical modeling in its entirety, but in￾terested students are encouraged to seek outside references (see, for example, [76–80]).
The next step is the selection of a controller, which often consists of a summing 
amplifier that will compare the desired response and the actual response and then 
forward this error-measurement signal to an amplifier.
The final step in the design process is the adjustment of the parameters 
of the system to achieve the desired performance. If we can achieve the desired 
performance by adjusting the parameters, we will finalize the design and proceed 
to document the results. If not, we will need to establish an improved system con￾figuration and perhaps select an enhanced actuator and sensor. Then we will repeat 
the design steps until we are able to meet the specifications, or until we decide the 
specifications are too demanding and should be relaxed.
The design process has been dramatically affected by the advent of powerful 
and inexpensive computers, and effective control design and analysis software. 
For example, the Boeing 777 was the world’s first 100% digitally designed civilian 
aircraft.The benefits of this design approach to Boeing was a 50% saving in devel￾opment costs, a 93% reduction in design change and rework rate, and a 50–80% 
reduction in problems compared with traditional manufacturing [56]. The follow-on 
project, known as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, was developed without physical pro￾totypes. In many applications, the availability of digital design tools, including the 
certification of the control system in realistic computer simulations, represents a 
significant cost reduction in terms of money and time.
Another notable innovation in design is the generative design process coupled 
with artificial intelligence [57]. Generative design is an iterative design process that 
typically utilizes a computer program to generate a (potentially large) number of 
designs based on a given set of constraints provided by the designer. The designer 
then fine-tunes the feasible solution provided by the computer program by adjust￾ing the constraint space to reduce the number of viable solutions. For example, the 
generative design is revolutionizing aircraft design [58]. The application of the highly 
computer-intensive generative design process in feedback control theory remains an 
open question. However, the generative design process concept can also be applied 
in a more traditional (less computationally intensive) environment to enhance the 
design process in Figure 1.17. For example, once a single design has been found that 
meets the specifications, the process can be repeated by selecting different system 
configurations and controller structures. After a number of controllers are designed 
that meet the specifications, the designer can then begin to narrow the design by ad￾justing the constraints. There are facets of the generative design process that will be 
illuminated in this book as we discuss the control system design process.
In summary, the controller design problem is as follows: Given a model of the 
system to be controlled (including its sensors and actuators) and a set of design 
goals, find a suitable controller, or determine that none exists. As with most of 
engineering design, the design of a feedback control system is an iterative and non￾linear process. A successful designer must consider the underlying physics of the 
M01_DORF2374_14_GE_C01.indd 49 13/09/2021 14:1750 Chapter 1 Introduction to Control Systems
plant under control, the control design strategy, the controller design architecture 
(that is, what type of controller will be employed), and effective controller tuning 
strategies. In addition, once the design is completed, the controller is often imple￾mented in hardware, and hence issues of interfacing with hardware can appear. 
When taken together, these different phases of control system design make the 
task of designing and implementing a control system quite challenging [73].
1.6 MECHATRONIC SYSTEMS
A natural stage in the evolutionary process of modern engineering design is 
encompassed in the area known as mechatronics [64]. The term mechatronics was 
coined in Japan in the 1970s [65–67]. Mechatronics is the synergistic integration 
of mechanical, electrical, and computer systems and has evolved over the past 
30  years, leading to a new breed of intelligent products. Feedback control is an 
integral aspect of modern mechatronic systems. One can understand the extent that 
mechatronics reaches into various disciplines by considering the components that 
make up mechatronics [68–71]. The key elements of mechatronics are (1) physical 
systems modeling, (2) sensors and actuators, (3) signals and systems, (4) computers 
and logic systems, and (5) software and data acquisition. Feedback control encom￾passes aspects of all five key elements of mechatronics, but is associated primarily 
with the element of signals and systems, as illustrated in Figure 1.18.
Advances in computer hardware and software technology coupled with the 
desire to increase the performance-to-cost ratio has revolutionized engineering 
design. New products are being developed at the intersection of traditional disci￾plines of engineering, computer science, and the natural sciences. Advancements in 
traditional disciplines are fueling the growth of mechatronics systems by providing

“enabling  technologies.” A  critical enabling technology was the microprocessor 
which has had a profound effect on the design of consumer products. We should 
expect continued advancements in cost-effective microprocessors and microcon￾trollers, novel sensors and actuators enabled by advancements in applications of 
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), advanced control methodologies and 
real-time programming methods, networking and wireless technologies, and mature 
computer-aided engineering (CAE) technologies for advanced system modeling, 
virtual prototyping, and testing. The continued rapid development in these areas 
will only accelerate the pace of smart (that is, actively controlled) products.
An exciting area of mechatronic system development in which control systems 
will play a significant role is the area of alternative energy production and con￾sumption. Hybrid fuel automobiles and efficient wind power generation are two 
examples of systems that can benefit from mechatronic design methods. In fact, 
the mechatronic design philosophy can be effectively illustrated by the example of 
the evolution of the modern automobile [64]. Before the 1960s, the radio was the 
only significant electronic device in an automobile. Today, many automobiles have 
many microcontrollers, and a multitude of sensors, and thousands of lines of soft￾ware code. A modern automobile can no longer be classified as a strictly mechan￾ical machine—it has been transformed into a comprehensive mechatronic system.
EXAMPLE 1.9 Hybrid fuel vehicles
A hybrid fuel automobile, depicted in Figure 1.19, utilizes a conventional internal 
combustion engine in combination with a battery (or other energy storage device 
such as a fuel cell or flywheel) and an electric motor to provide a propulsion system 
capable of doubling the fuel economy over conventional automobiles. Although 
these hybrid vehicles will never be zero-emission vehicles (since they have inter￾nal combustion engines), they can reduce the level of harmful emissions by one￾third to one-half, and with future improvements, these emissions may reduce 
even further. As stated earlier, the modern automobile requires many advanced 
control systems to operate. The control systems must regulate the performance of

the engine, including fuel–air mixtures, valve timing, transmissions, wheel traction 
control, antilock brakes, and electronically controlled suspensions, among many 
other functions. On the hybrid fuel vehicle, there are additional control functions 
that must be satisfied. Especially necessary is the control of power between the in￾ternal combustion engine and the electric motor, determining power storage needs 
and implementing the battery charging, and preparing the vehicle for low-emission 
start-ups. The overall effectiveness of the hybrid fuel vehicle depends on the com￾bination of power units that are selected (e.g., battery versus fuel cell for power 
storage). Ultimately, however, the control strategy that integrates the various 
electrical and mechanical components into a viable transportation system strongly 
influences the acceptability of the hybrid fuel vehicle concept in the marketplace. ■
The second example of a mechatronic system is the advanced wind power gen￾eration system.
EXAMPLE 1.10 Wind power
Many nations in the world today are faced with unstable energy supplies. 
Additionally, the negative effects of fossil fuel utilization on the quality of our air 
are well documented. Many nations have an imbalance in the supply and demand 
of energy, consuming more than they produce. To address this imbalance, many 
engineers are considering developing advanced systems to access other sources of 
energy, such as wind energy. In fact, wind energy is one of the fastest-growing forms 
of energy generation in the United States and in other locations around the world. 
A wind farm is illustrated in Figure 1.20.
By the end of 2019, the installed global wind energy capacity was over 650.8 GW. 
In the United States, there was enough energy derived from wind to power over 
27.5 million homes, according to the American Wind Energy Association. For the 
past 40 years, researchers have concentrated on developing technologies that work 
well in high wind areas (defined to be areas with a wind speed of at least 6.7 m/s 
at a height of  10  m). Most of the easily accessible high wind sites in the United 
States are now utilized, and improved technology must be developed to make lower 
wind areas more cost effective. New developments are required in materials and

aerodynamics so that longer turbine rotors can operate efficiently in the lower 
winds, and in a related problem, the towers that support the turbine must be made 
taller without increasing the overall costs. In addition, advanced controls will be 
required to achieve the level of efficiency required in the wind generation drive 
train. Newer wind turbines can operate in wind speeds less than 1 mph. ■
EXAMPLE 1.11 Wearable computers
Many contemporary control systems are embedded control systems [81]. Embedded 
control systems employ on-board special-purpose digital computers as integral 
components of the feedback loop. Many new wearable products include embed￾ded computers. This includes wristwatches, eyeglasses, sports wristbands, e-textiles, 
and computer garments. Figure 1.21 illustrates the popular computer eyeglasses. 
For example, the glasses devices might enable physicians to access and manage data 
and display the data when they need it during a patient examination. One might 
imagine future applications where the device would monitor and track the doctor’s 
eye movements and use that information in a feedback loop to very precisely control 
a medical instrument during a procedure. The utilization of wearable computers in 
feedback control applications is in its infancy and the possibilities are enormous. ■
Advances in sensors, actuators, and communication devices are leading to a new 
class of embedded control systems that are networked using wireless technology, 
thereby enabling spatially-distributed control. Embedded control system designers 
must be able to understand and work with various network protocols, diverse oper￾ating systems and programming languages. While the theory of systems and controls 
serves as the foundation for the modern control system design, the design process is 
rapidly expanding into a multi-disciplinary enterprise encompassing multiple engi￾neering areas, as well as information technology and computer science.
Advances in alternate energy products, such as the hybrid automobile and the 
generation of efficient wind power generators, provide vivid examples of mecha￾tronics development. There are numerous other examples of intelligent systems 
poised to enter our everyday life, including autonomous rovers, smart home 
appliances (e.g., dishwashers, vacuum cleaners, and microwave ovens), wireless 
network-enabled devices, “human-friendly machines” [72] that perform robot￾assisted surgery, and implantable sensors and actuators.

1.7 GREEN ENGINEERING
Global issues such as climate change, clean water, sustainability, waste manage￾ment, emissions reduction, and minimizing raw material and energy use have 
caused many engineers to re-think existing approaches to engineering design 
in critical areas. One outcome of the evolving design strategy is to consider an 
approach that has come to be known as “green engineering.” The goal of green 
engineering is to design products that will minimize pollution, reduce the risk to 
human health, and improve the environment. The basic principles of green engi￾neering are [86]:
1. Engineer processes and products holistically, use systems analysis, and integrate envi￾ronmental impact assessment tools.
2. Conserve and improve natural ecosystems while protecting human health and well-being.
3. Use life-cycle thinking in all engineering activities.
4. Ensure that all material and energy inputs and outputs are as inherently safe and 
benign as possible.
5. Minimize depletion of natural resources.
6. Strive to prevent waste.
7. Develop and apply engineering solutions, while being cognizant of local geography, 
aspirations, and cultures.
8. Create engineering solutions beyond current or dominant technologies; improve, 
innovate, and invent technologies to achieve sustainability.
9. Actively engage communities and stakeholders in development of engineering solutions.
Putting the principles of green engineering into practice leads us to a deeper 
understanding of the power of feedback control systems as an enabling technology. 
For example, in Section 1.9, we present a discussion on smart grids. Smart grids 
aim to deliver electrical power more reliably and efficiently in an environmentally 
friendly fashion. This in turn will potentially enable the large-scale use of renewable 
energy sources, such as wind and solar, that are naturally intermittent. Sensing and 
feedback are key technology areas that enable the smart grids [87]. Green engineer￾ing applications can be classified into one of five categories [88]:
1. Environmental Monitoring
2. Energy Storage Systems
3. Power Quality Monitoring
4. Solar Energy
5. Wind Energy
As the field of green engineering matures, it is almost certain that more applica￾tions will evolve, especially as we apply the eighth principle (listed above) of green 
engineering to create engineering solutions beyond current or dominant technolo￾gies and improve, innovate, and invent technologies. In the subsequent chapters, we 
present examples from each of these areas.
M01_DORF2374_14_GE_C01.indd 54 13/09/2021 14:17Section 1.8 The Future Evolution of Control Systems 55
There is a global effort underway to reduce greenhouse gases from all sources. 
To accomplish this, it is necessary to improve both the quality and quantity of our 
environmental monitoring systems. An example is using wireless measurements on 
a cabled robotic controlled mobile sensing platform moving along the forest under￾story to measure key environmental parameters in a rain forest.
Energy storage systems are critical technologies for green engineering. There 
are many types of energy storage systems. The energy storage system we are most fa￾miliar with is the battery. Batteries are used to power most of the electronic devices 
in use today; some batteries are rechargeable and some are single-use throwaways. 
To adhere to green engineering principles, we would favor energy storage systems 
that are renewable. A very important energy storage device for green engineering 
systems is the fuel cell.
The problems associated with power quality monitoring are varied and can 
include leading and lagging power, voltage variations, and waveform harmonics. 
Many of the green engineering systems and components require careful monitoring 
of current and voltages. An interesting example would be the modeling of cur￾rent transformers that are used in various capacities for measuring and monitoring 
within the power grid network of interconnected systems used to deliver electricity.
Efficiently converting solar energy into electricity is an engineering challenge. 
Two technologies for generation of electricity using sunshine are solar photovoltaic 
and solar thermal. With photovoltaic systems the sunlight is converted directly to 
electricity, and with solar thermal the sun heats water to create steam that is used to 
power steam engines. Designing and deploying solar photovoltaic systems for solar 
power generation is one approach employing green engineering principles to utilize 
the sun’s energy to power our homes, offices, and businesses.
Power derived from wind is an important source of renewable energy around 
the world. Wind energy conversion to electric power is achieved by wind energy 
turbines connected to electric generators. The intermittency characteristic of wind 
energy makes the smart grid development essential to bring the energy to the power 
grid when it is available and to provide energy from other sources when the wind 
dies down or is disrupted. The irregular character of wind direction and power also 
results in the need for reliable, steady electric energy by using control systems on 
the wind turbines themselves. The goal of these control devices is to reduce the 
effects of wind intermittency and the effect of wind direction change.
The role of control systems in green engineering will continue to expand as the 
global issues facing us require ever increasing levels of automation and precision.
1.8 THE FUTURE EVOLUTION OF CONTROL SYSTEMS
The continuing goal of control systems is to provide extensive flexibility and a high 
level of autonomy. Two system concepts are approaching this goal by different 
evolutionary pathways, as illustrated in Figure 1.22. Today’s industrial robot is 
perceived as quite autonomous—once it is programmed, further intervention is 
not normally required. Because of sensory limitations, these robotic systems have 
limited flexibility in adapting to work environment changes; improving perception 
is the motivation of computer vision research. The control system is very adaptable, 
M01_DORF2374_14_GE_C01.indd 55 13/09/2021 14:1756 Chapter 1 Introduction to Control Systems
but it relies on human supervision. Advanced robotic systems are striving for task 
adaptability through enhanced sensory feedback. Research areas concentrating on 
artificial intelligence, sensor integration, computer vision, and off-line CAD/CAM 
programming will make systems more universal and economical. Control systems 
are moving toward autonomous operation as an enhancement to human control. 
Research in supervisory control, human–machine interface methods, and computer 
database management are intended to reduce operator burden and improve operator 
efficiency. Many research activities are common to robotics and control systems and 
are aimed at reducing implementation cost and expanding the realm of application. 
These include improved communication methods and advanced programming 
languages.
The easing of human labor by technology, a process that began in prehistory, 
is entering a new stage. The acceleration in the pace of technological innovation 
inaugurated by the Industrial Revolution has until recently resulted mainly in the 
displacement of human muscle power from the tasks of production. The current 
revolution in computer technology is causing an equally momentous social change, 
the expansion of information gathering and information processing as computers 
extend the reach of the human brain [16].
Control systems are used to achieve (1) increased productivity and (2) improved 
performance of a device or system. Automation is used to improve productivity and 
obtain high-quality products. Automation is the automatic operation or control of a 
process, device, or system. We use automatic control of machines and processes to 
produce a product reliably and with high precision [28]. With the demand for flexible, 
custom production, a need for flexible automation and robotics is growing [17, 25].
The theory, practice, and application of automatic control is a large, exciting, 
and extremely useful engineering discipline. One can readily understand the moti￾vation for a study of modern control systems.

1.9 DESIGN EXAMPLES
In this section we present illustrative design examples. This is a pattern that we will 
follow in all subsequent chapters. Each chapter will contain a number of interesting 
examples in a special section entitled Design Examples meant to highlight the main 
topics of the chapter. At least one example among those presented in the Design 
Example section will be a more detailed problem and solution that demonstrates one 
or more of the steps in the design process shown in Figure 1.17. In the first example, 
we discuss the development of the smart grid as a concept to deliver electrical power 
more reliably and efficiently as part of a strategy to provide a more environmentally 
friendly energy delivery system. The smart grid will enable the large-scale use of re￾newable energy sources that depend on the natural phenomenon to generate power 
and which are intermittent, such as wind and solar. Providing clean energy is an en￾gineering challenge that must necessarily include active feedback control systems, 
sensors, and actuators. In the second example presented here, a rotating disk speed 
control illustrates the concept of open-loop and closed-loop feedback control. The 
third example is an insulin delivery control system in which we determine the design 
goals, the variables to control, and a preliminary closed-loop system configuration.
EXAMPLE 1.12 Smart grid control systems
A smart grid is as much a concept as it is a physical system. In essence, the concept 
is to deliver power more reliably and efficiently while remaining environmentally 
friendly, economical, and safe [89, 90]. A smart grid can be viewed as a system com￾prised of hardware and software that routes power more reliably and efficiently 
to homes, businesses, schools, and other users of power. One view of the smart 
grid is illustrated schematically in Figure 1.23. Smart grids can be national or local 
in scope. One can even consider home smart grids (or microgrids). In fact, smart 
grids encompass a wide and rich field of investigation. As we will find, control sys￾tems play a key role in smart grids at all levels.
One interesting aspect of the smart grid is real-time demand side management 
requiring a two-way flow of information between the user and the power genera￾tion system [91]. For example, smart meters are used to measure electricity use in 
the home and office. These sensors transmit data to utilities and allow the utility to 
transmit control signals back to a home or building. These smart meters can control 
and turn on or off home and office appliances and devices. Smart home-energy de￾vices enable the homeowners to control their usage and respond to price changes at 
peak-use times.
The five key technologies required to implement a successful modern smart grid 
include (i) integrated communications, (ii) sensing and measurements, (iii) advanced 
components, (iv) advanced control methods, and (v) improved interfaces and deci￾sion support [87]. Two of the five key technologies fall under the general category 
of control systems, namely (ii) sensing and measurements and (iii) advanced control 
methods. It is evident that control systems will play a key role in realizing the mod￾ern smart grid. The potential impact of the smart grid on delivery of power is very 
high. Currently, the total U.S. grid includes 9,200 units generating over 1 million MW 
of capacity over 300,000 miles of transmission lines. A smart grid will use sensors, 
M01_DORF2374_14_GE_C01.indd 57 13/09/2021 14:1758 Chapter 1 Introduction to Control Systems
controllers, the Internet, and communication systems to improve the reliability and 
efficiency of the grid. It is estimated that deployment of smart grids could reduce 
emissions of CO2 by 12 percent by 2030 [91].
One of the elements of the smart grid are the distribution networks that measure 
and control usage. In a smart grid, the power generation depends on the market situ￾ation (supply/demand and cost) and the power source available (wind, coal, nuclear, 
geothermal, biomass, etc.). In fact, smart grid customers with solar panels or wind 
turbines can sell their excess energy to the grid and get paid as microgenerators [92]. 
In the subsequent chapters, we discuss various control problems associated with 
pointing solar panels to the sun and with prescribing the pitch of the wind turbine 
blades to manage the rotor speed thereby controlling the power output.
Transmission of power is called power flow and the improved control of power 
will increase its security and efficiency. Transmission lines have inductive, capaci￾tive, and resistive effects that result in dynamic impacts or disturbances. The smart 
grid must anticipate and respond to system disturbances rapidly. This is referred 
to as self-healing. In other words, a smart grid should be capable of managing sig￾nificant disturbances occurring on very short time scales. To accomplish this, the 
self-healing process is constructed around the idea of a feedback control system 
where self-assessments are used to detect and analyze disturbances so that corrective 
action can be applied to restore the grid. This requires sensing and measurements

to provide information to the control systems. One of the benefits of using smart 
grids is that renewable energy sources that depend on intermittent natural phe￾nomena (such as wind and sunshine) can potentially be utilized more efficiently by 
allowing for load shedding when the wind dies out or clouds block the sunshine.
Feedback control systems will play an increasingly important role in the 
development of smart grids as we move to the target date. It may be interesting to 
recall the various topics discussed in this section in the context of control systems 
as each chapter in this textbook unfolds new methods of control system design and 
analysis. ■
EXAMPLE 1.13 Rotating disk speed control
Many modern devices employ a rotating disk held at a constant speed. For example, 
spinning disk conformal microscopes enable line-cell imaging in biomedical applications. 
Our goal is to design a system for rotating disk speed control that will ensure that 
the actual speed of rotation is within a specified percentage of the desired speed [40, 43]. 
We will consider a system without feedback and a system with feedback.
To obtain disk rotation, we will select a DC motor as the actuator because it 
provides a speed proportional to the applied motor voltage. For the input voltage to 
the motor, we will select an amplifier that can provide the required power.
The open-loop system (without feedback) is shown in Figure 1.24(a). This system 
uses a battery source to provide a voltage that is proportional to the desired speed. 
This voltage is amplified and applied to the motor. The block diagram of the open￾loop system identifying the controller, actuator, and process is shown in Figure 1.24(b).
To obtain a feedback system, we need to select a sensor. One useful sensor is 
a tachometer that provides an output voltage proportional to the speed of its shaft. 
Thus the closed-loop feedback system takes the form shown in Figure 1.25(a). 
The block diagram model of the feedback system is shown in Figure 1.25(b). The 
error voltage is generated by the difference between the input voltage and the 
tachometer voltage.
We expect the feedback system of Figure 1.25 to be superior to the open-loop 
system of Figure 1.24 because the feedback system will respond to errors and act to

reduce them. With precision components, we could expect to reduce the error of 
the feedback system to one-hundredth of the error of the open-loop system. ■
EXAMPLE 1.14 Insulin delivery control system
Control systems have been utilized in the biomedical field to create implanted auto￾matic drug-delivery systems to patients [29–31]. Automatic systems can be used to 
regulate blood pressure, blood sugar level, and heart rate. A common application 
of control engineering is in the field of drug delivery in which mathematical models 
of the dose–effect relationship of the drugs are used. A drug-delivery system im￾planted in the body uses a closed-loop system since miniaturized glucose sensors are 
now available. The best solutions rely on individually programmable, pocket-sized 
insulin pumps that can deliver insulin.
The blood glucose and insulin concentrations for a healthy person are shown in 
Figure 1.26. The system must provide the insulin from a reservoir implanted within 
the diabetic person. Therefore, the control goal is:
Control Goal
Design a system to regulate the blood sugar concentration of a diabetic by 
controlled dispensing of insulin.
Referring to Figure 1.26, the next step in the design process is to define the vari￾able to be controlled. Associated with the control goal we can define the variable 
to be controlled to be:
Variable to Be Controlled
Blood glucose concentration
In subsequent chapters, we will have the tools to quantitatively describe the 
control design specifications using a variety of steady-state performance

specifications and transient response specifications, both in the time-domain and 
in the frequency domain. At this point, the control design specifications will be 
qualitative and imprecise. In that regard, for the problem at hand, we can state 
the design specification as:
Control Design Specifications
Provide a blood glucose level for the diabetic that closely approximates 
(tracks) the glucose level of a healthy person.
Given the design goals, variables to be controlled, and control design specifications, 
we can now propose a preliminary system configuration. A closed-loop system uses 
a fully implantable glucose sensor and miniature motor pump to regulate the insulin 
delivery rate as shown in Figure 1.27. The feedback control system uses a sensor to 
measure the actual glucose level and compare that level with the desired level, thus 
turning the motor pump on when it is required. ■

1.10 SEQUENTIAL DESIGN EXAMPLE: DISK DRIVE READ SYSTEM
We will use the design process of Figure 1.17 in each chapter to identify the steps 
that we are accomplishing. For example, in Chapter 1 we (1) identify the control 
goal, (2) identify the variables to control, (3) write the initial specifications for the 
variables, and (4) establish the preliminary system configuration.
Information can be readily and efficiently stored on magnetic disks. Hard disk 
drives (HDD) are used in notebook computers and larger computers of all sizes 
and are essentially all standardized as defined by ANSI standards. Even with the 
advent of advanced storage technologies, such as cloud storage, flash memory, and 
solid-state drives (SSDs), the HDD remains an important storage media. The role 
of the HDD is changing from fast and primary storage to slow storage with enor￾mous capacity [50]. The installation of SSD units are surpassing HDD units for the 
first time. The SSD units are known to have much better performance than HDD, 
however, the difference in cost per gigabyte ratio is about 6:1, and that is expected 
to remain that way until 2030. Among the many reasons to keep our interest in 
HDD units is that it is anticipated that about 90% of the required capacity for cloud 
computing applications will be realized with HHDs moving into the foreseeable fu￾ture [51, 62]. In the past, disk drive designers have concentrated on increasing data 
density and data access times. Designers are now considering employing disk drives 
to perform tasks historically delegated to central processing units (CPUs), thereby 
leading to improvements in the computing environment [63]. Three areas of “in￾telligence” under investigation include off-line error recovery, disk drive failure 
warnings, and storing data across multiple disk drives. Consider the basic diagram 
of a disk drive shown in Figure 1.28. The goal of the disk drive reader device is to 
position the reader head to read the data stored on a track on the disk. The variable 
to accurately control is the position of the reader head (mounted on a slider device). 
The disk rotates at a speed between 1800 and 10,000 rpm, and the head “flies” above 
the disk at a distance of less than 100 nm. The initial specification for the position 
accuracy is 1 µm. Furthermore, we plan to be able to move the head from track a to 
track b within 50 ms, if possible. Thus, we establish an initial system configuration

the disk drive further in Chapter 2.
1.11 SUMMARY
In this chapter, we discussed open- and closed-loop feedback control systems. 
Examples of control systems through the course of history were presented to mo￾tivate and connect the subject to the past. In terms of contemporary issues, key 
areas of application were discussed, including humanoid robots, unmanned aerial 
vehicles, wind energy, hybrid automobiles, and embedded control. The central 
role of controls in mechatronics was discussed. Mechatronics is the synergistic 
integration of mechanical, electrical, and computer systems. Finally, the design 
process was presented in a structured form and included the following steps: the 
establishment of goals and variables to be controlled, definition of specifications, 
system definition, modeling, and analysis. The iterative nature of design allows us 
to handle the design gap effectively while accomplishing necessary trade-offs in 
complexity, performance, and cost.

sailboats tack upwind—the familiar zigzag course—

Problems require extending the concepts of this chapter 
to new situations.
The following systems may be described by a block 
diagram showing the cause–effect relationship and 
the feedback (if present). Each block should de￾scribe its function. Use Figure 1.3 as a model where 
appropriate.

part of a closed-loop control system. Sketch the 
block diagram of the valve control system shown in 
Figure P1.2.
P1.3 In a chemical process control system, it is valuable 
to control the chemical composition of the product. 
To do so, a measurement of the composition can 
be obtained by using an infrared stream analyzer, 
as shown in Figure P1.3. The valve on the additive

Sergeant, why do you stop every day and check your 
watch?”
The sergeant replied, “I’m the gunner at the 
fort!”
Is the feedback prevalent in this case positive or 
negative? The jeweler’s chronometer loses two min￾utes each 24-hour period and the sergeant’s watch loses 
three minutes during each eight hours. What is the net 
time error of the cannon at the fort after 12 days?
P1.8 In a public address system, when the microphone 
is placed too close to the loudspeaker, a positive 
feedback system is inadvertently created. The audio 
input from the microphone is amplified, which comes 
out through the loudspeaker. This audio output is 
received by the microphone again, which gets ampli￾fied further, and comes out through the loudspeaker 
again. This positive loop gain is known as audio feed￾back or the Larsen effect, and causes the system to 
overload, resulting in a high-pitched sound. Construct 
the corresponding feedback model, and identify each 
block of the model.
P1.9 Models of physiological control systems are 
valuable aids to the medical profession. A model 
of the heart-rate control system is shown in Figure 
P1.9 [23, 48]. This model includes the processing 
of the nerve signals by the brain. The heart-rate

P1.6 Feedback systems do not always involve negative 
feedback. Economic inflation, which is evidenced by 
continually rising prices, is a positive feedback system. 
A positive feedback control system, as shown in Figure 
P1.6, adds the feedback signal to the input signal, and the 
resulting signal is used as the input to the process. A sim￾ple model of the price–wage inflationary spiral is shown 
in Figure P1.6. Add additional feedback loops, such as 
legislative control or control of the tax rate, to stabilize 
the system. It is assumed that an increase in workers’ 
salaries, after some time delay, results in an increase in 
prices. Under what conditions could prices be stabilized 
by falsifying or delaying the availability of cost-of-living 
data? How would a national wage and price economic 
guideline program affect the feedback system?
P1.7 The story is told about the sergeant who stopped at

“Is it set according to time signals from 
Arlington?” asked the sergeant.
“No,” said the owner, “I set it by the five o’clock

Engineers are developing air traffic control systems 
and collision avoidance systems using the Global

55]. GPS allows each aircraft to know its position in 
the airspace landing corridor very precisely. Sketch a 
block diagram depicting how an air traffic controller 
might use GPS for aircraft collision avoidance.
P1.11 Automatic control of water level using a float 
level was used in the Middle East for a water clock 
[1, 11]. The water clock (Figure P1.11) was used 
from sometime before Christ until the 17th century. 
Discuss the operation of the water clock, and estab￾lish how the float provides a feedback control that 
maintains  the accuracy of the clock. Sketch a block

P1.12 An automatic turning gear for windmills was in￾vented by Meikle in about 1750 [1, 11]. The fantail 
gear shown in Figure P1.12 automatically turns 
the windmill into the wind. The fantail windmill at 
right angle to the mainsail is used to turn the turret. 
The gear ratio is of the order of 3000 to 1. Discuss the 
operation of the windmill, and establish the feedback 
operation that maintains the main sails into the wind.
P1.13 A common example of a two-input control system 
is an automobile power transmission system, with a 
gear shifter and an accelerator pedal. The objective is 
to obtain (1) a desired speed and (2) a desired torque.

system.
P1.14 Adam Smith (1723–1790) discussed the issue of 
free competition between the participants of an econ￾omy in his book Wealth of Nations. It may be said 
that Smith employed social feedback mechanisms 
to explain his theories [41]. Smith suggests that (1) 
the available workers as a whole compare the various 
possible employments and enter that one offering 
the greatest rewards, and (2) in any employment the

trades, c = total of rewards in a particular trade, and 
q = inux of workers into the specific trade. Sketch a

P1.15 Small computers are used as part of a start-stop 
system in automobiles to control emissions and ob￾tain improved gas mileage. A computer-controlled 
start-stop system that automatically stops and re￾starts an engine to reduce the time the engine idles 
could improve gas mileage and reduce unwanted pol￾luting emissions significantly. Sketch a block diagram 
for such a system for an automobile.
P1.16 All humans have experienced a fever associated 
with an illness. A fever is related to the changing 
of the control input in the body’s thermostat. This 
thermostat, within the brain, normally regulates 
temperature near 98°F in spite of external tem￾peratures ranging from 0°F to 100°F or more. For 
a fever, the input, or desired, temperature is in￾creased. Even to many scientists, it often comes 
as a surprise to learn that fever does not indicate 
something wrong with body temperature control 
but rather well-contrived regulation at an elevated 
level of desired input. Sketch a block diagram of 
the temperature control system and explain how 
aspirin will lower a fever.

P1.18 A cutaway view of a commonly used pressure 
regulator is shown in Figure P1.18. The desired 
pressure is set by turning a calibrated screw. This 
compresses the spring and sets up a force that 
opposes the upward motion of the diaphragm. 
The bottom side of the diaphragm is exposed 
to the  water pressure that is to be controlled. 
Thus the motion of the diaphragm is an indication 
of the pressure difference between the desired and 
the actual pressures. It acts like a comparator. The 
valve is connected to the diaphragm and moves 
according to the pressure difference until it reaches 
a position in which the difference is zero. Sketch a 
block diagram showing the control system with the 
output pressure as the regulated variable.
P1.19 Ichiro Masaki of General Motors has patented 
a system that automatically adjusts a car’s speed to 
keep a safe distance from vehicles in front. Using a 
video camera, the system detects and stores a ref￾erence image of the car in front. It then compares 
this image with a stream of incoming live images 
as the two cars move down the highway and calcu￾lates the distance. Masaki suggests that the system 
could control steering as well as speed, allowing 
drivers to lock on to the car ahead and get a “com￾puterized tow.” Sketch a block diagram for the 
control system.

P1.25 In the past 50 years, over 20,000 metric tons of 
hardware have been placed in Earth’s orbit. During 
the same time span, over 15,000 metric tons of hard￾ware returned to Earth. The objects remaining in 
Earth’s orbit range in size from large operational 
spacecraft to tiny flecks of paint. There are over 
500,000 objects in Earth’s orbit 1 cm or larger in 
size. About 20,000 of the space objects are currently 
tracked from groundstations on the Earth. Space 
traffic control [61] is becoming an important issue, 
especially for commercial satellite companies that 
plan to “fly” their satellites through orbit altitudes 
where other satellites are operating, and through 
areas where high concentrations of space debris 
may exist. Sketch a block diagram of a space traffic 
control system that commercial companies might 
use to keep their satellites safe from collisions while 
operating in space.

P1.21 The potential of employing two or more helicop￾ters for transporting payloads that are too heavy 
for a single helicopter is a well-addressed issue in 
the civil and military rotorcraft design arenas [37]. 
Overall requirements can be satisfied more effi￾ciently with a smaller aircraft by using multilift 
for infrequent peak demands. Hence the principal 
motivation for using multilift can be attributed to 
the promise of obtaining increased productivity 
without having to manufacture larger and more 
expensive helicopters. A specific case of a multilift 
arrangement where two helicopters jointly trans￾port payloads has been named twin lift. Figure P1.21 
shows a typical “two-point pendant” twin lift config￾uration in the lateral/vertical plane.

back to Earth.
P1.27 A direct methanol fuel cell is an electrochemical 
device that converts a methanol water solution to 
electricity [75]. Like rechargeable batteries, fuel cells 
directly convert chemicals to energy; they are very 
often compared to batteries, specifically recharge￾able batteries. However, one significant difference 
between rechargeable batteries and direct methanol 
fuel cells is that, by adding more methanol water 
solution, the fuel cells recharge instantly. Sketch a 
block diagram of the direct methanol fuel cell re￾charging system that uses feedback to continuously 
monitor and recharge the fuel cell.

AP1.1 The development of robotic microsurgery de￾vices will have major implications on delicate eye and 
brain surgical procedures. One such device is shown 
in Figure AP1.1. Haptic (force and tactile) feedback 
can greatly help a surgeon by mimicking the physical 
interaction that takes place between the microsurgery 
robotic manipulator and human tissue. Sketch a block 
diagram for a haptic and tactile subsystem with a mi￾crosurgical device in the loop being operated by a sur￾geon. Assume that the force of the end-effector on the 
microsurgical device can be measured and is available

AP1.2 Advanced wind energy systems are being installed 
in many locations throughout the world as a way 
for nations to deal with rising fuel prices and energy 
shortages, and to reduce the negative effects of fossil 
fuel utilization on the quality of the air. The modern 
windmill can be viewed as a mechatronic system. Think 
about how an advanced wind energy system would 
be designed as a mechatronic system. List the various 
components of the wind energy system and associate 
each component with one of the five elements of a 
mechatronic system: physical system modeling, signals 
and systems, computers and logic systems, software and 
data acquisition, and sensors and actuators.
AP1.3 Many modern luxury automobiles have an ad￾vanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) option. 
The collision avoidance feature of an ADAS system

observations [98]. In both cases, the approach is to use a 
wavefront sensor to measure distortions in the incom￾ing light and to actively control and compensate to the 
errors induced by the distortions. Consider the case of 
an extremely large ground-based optical telescope, pos￾sibly an optical telescope up to 100 meters in diameter. 
The telescope components include deformable mir￾rors actuated by micro-electro-mechanical (MEMS) 
devices and sensors to measure the distortion of the 
incoming light as it passes through the turbulent and 
uncertain atmosphere of Earth.
There is at least one major technological bar￾rier to  constructing a 100-m optical telescope. The 
numerical computations associated with the control 
and compensation of the extremely large optical 
telescope can be on the order of 1010 calculations each 
1.5 ms. If we assume that the computational capability 
is available, then one can consider the design of 
a feedback control system that uses the available 
computational power. We can consider many control 
issues associated with the large-scale optical telescope. 
Some of the controls problems that might be con￾sidered include controlling the pointing of the main 
dish, controlling the individual deformable mirrors, 
and attenuating the deformation of the dish due to 
changes in outside temperature.
Describe a closed-loop feedback control sys￾tem to control one of the deformable mirrors to 
compensate for the distortions in the incoming light.

in the world. Traveling at up to 10 m/s, the elevators 
have the world’s longest travel distance from low￾est to highest stop. Describe a closed-loop feedback

aids humans in maintaining their homes. A dirt de￾tection control system would enable the robotic 
vacuum cleaner to vacuum the same area more than 
once if the dirt level is unsatisfactory, since a single 
pass may not be enough to adequately remove a high 
level of dirt. If the robotic vacuum cleaner detects 
more dirt than usual, it should vacuum the same 
area until the sensors detect lesser dirt in that area. 
Describe a closed-loop feedback control system to 
detect an acceptable level of dirt, so that the robotic 
vacuum cleaner will vacuum the same area again.

promising to enable medical nanorobots to emerge 
within the next decade [99]. Many interesting med￾ical applications will benefit from nanorobotics. For

PREVIEW
Mathematical models of physical systems are key elements in the design and 
analysis of control systems. The dynamic behavior is generally described by ordi￾nary differential equations. We will consider a wide range of systems. Since most 
physical systems are nonlinear, we will discuss linearization approximations which 
allow us to use Laplace transform methods. We will then proceed to obtain the 
input–output relationship in the form of transfer functions. The transfer functions 
can be organized into block diagrams or signal-flow graphs to graphically depict 
the interconnections. Block diagrams and signal-flow graphs are very convenient 
and natural tools for designing and analyzing complicated control systems. We 
conclude the chapter by developing transfer function models for the various com￾ponents of the Sequential Design Example: Disk Drive Read System.

systems.
	❏ Utilize linearization approximations through Taylor series.
	❏ Understand the application of Laplace transforms and their role in obtaining transfer 
functions.

2.1 INTRODUCTION
To understand and control complex systems, one must obtain quantitative 
mathematical models of these systems. It is necessary therefore to analyze the 
relationships between the system variables and to obtain a mathematical model. 
Because the systems under consideration are dynamic in nature, the descriptive 
equations are usually differential equations. Furthermore, if these equations can 
be linearized, then the Laplace transform can be used to simplify the method of 
solution. In practice, the complexity of systems and our ignorance of all the relevant 
factors necessitate the introduction of assumptions concerning the system opera￾tion. Therefore we will often find it useful to consider the physical system, express 
any necessary assumptions, and linearize the system. Then, by using the physical 
laws describing the linear equivalent system, we can obtain a set of time-invariant, 
ordinary linear differential equations. Finally, using mathematical tools, such as the 
Laplace transform, we obtain a solution describing the operation of the system. In 
summary, the approach to dynamic system modeling can be listed as follows:
1. Define the system and its components.
2. Formulate the mathematical model and fundamental necessary assumptions based on 
basic principles.
3. Obtain the differential equations representing the mathematical model.
4. Solve the equations for the desired output variables.
5. Examine the solutions and the assumptions.
6. If necessary, reanalyze or redesign the system.
2.2 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS OF PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
The differential equations describing the dynamic performance of a physical system 
are obtained by utilizing the physical laws of the process [1–4]. Consider the tor￾sional spring–mass system in Figure 2.1 with applied torque T t a ( ). Assume the 
torsional spring element is massless. Suppose we want to measure the torque T t s ( )
transmitted to the mass m. Since the spring is massless, the sum of the torques act￾ing on the spring itself must be zero, or
T t a s ( ) − = T t( ) 0,
which implies that T t s a ( ) = T t( ). We see immediately that the external torque 
T t a ( ) applied at the end of the spring is transmitted through the torsional spring. 
Because of this, we refer to the torque as a through-variable. In a similar manner, 
the angular rate difference associated with the torsional spring element is
ω ω ( )t t = − ( ) ω ( )t s a .
M02_DORF2374_14_GE_C02.indd 80 13/09/21 8:08 PMSection 2.2 Differential Equations of Physical Systems 81
Thus, the angular rate difference is measured across the torsional spring element 
and is referred to as an across-variable. These same types of arguments can be 
made for most common physical variables (such as force, current, volume, flow 
rate, etc.). A more complete discussion on through- and across-variables can be 
found in [26, 27]. A summary of the through- and across-variables of dynamic 
systems is given in Table 2.1 [5]. Information concerning the International System 
(SI) of units associated with the various variables discussed in this section can be 
found online, as well in many handy references, such as the MCS website.†
 For 
example, variables that measure temperature are degrees Kelvin in SI units, and 
variables that measure length are meters. A summary of the describing equations

❏ Through-variable: F T = = force,  torque, i Q = = current,  fluid volumetric flow

❏ Across-variable: υ = translational velocity, ω = angular velocity, υ = voltage,

The symbol v is used for both voltage in electrical circuits and velocity in 
translational mechanical systems and is distinguished within the context of each 
differential equation. For mechanical systems, one uses Newton’s laws; for electri￾cal systems, Kirchhoff’s voltage laws. For example, the simple spring-mass-damper 
mechanical system shown in Figure 2.2(a) is described by Newton’s second law of 
motion. The free-body diagram of the mass M is shown in Figure 2.2(b). In this 
spring-mass-damper example, we model the wall friction as a viscous damper, that 
is, the friction force is linearly proportional to the velocity of the mass. In reality 
the friction force may behave in a more complicated fashion. For example, the wall 
friction may behave as a Coulomb damper. Coulomb friction, also known as dry 
friction, is a nonlinear function of the mass velocity and possesses a discontinuity 
around zero velocity. For a well-lubricated, sliding surface, the viscous friction is 
appropriate and will be used here and in subsequent spring-mass-damper examples.

Alternatively, one may describe the electrical RLC circuit of Figure 2.3 by utiliz￾ing Kirchhoff’s current law. Then we obtain the following integrodifferential equation:

The solution of the differential equation describing the process may be obtained by 
classical methods such as the use of integrating factors and the method of undeter￾mined coefficients [1]. For example, when the mass is initially displaced a distance 
y y ( ) 0 = 0 and released, the dynamic response of the system can be represented by 
an equation of the form
y t K e t t 1 1  sin 1 . ( ) = + 1 ( ) β θ −α (2.3)
A similar solution is obtained for the voltage of the RLC circuit when the circuit is 
subjected to a constant current r t( ) = I. Then the voltage is
t K e t t 2 2  cos 2 . υ β ( ) = + 2 ( ) θ −α (2.4)
A voltage curve typical of an RLC circuit is shown in Figure 2.4.
To reveal further the close similarity between the differential equations for the 
mechanical and electrical systems, we shall rewrite Equation (2.1) in terms of velocity:

One immediately notes the equivalence of Equations (2.5) and (2.2) where velocity 
υ(t) and voltage υ(t) are equivalent variables, usually called analogous variables, and 
the systems are analogous systems. Therefore the solution for velocity is similar to 
Equation (2.4), and the response for an underdamped system is shown in Figure 2.4. 
The concept of analogous systems is a very useful and powerful technique for system 
modeling. The voltage–velocity analogy, often called the force–current analogy, is a 
natural one because it relates the analogous through- and across-variables of the elec￾trical and mechanical systems. Another analogy that relates the velocity and current 
variables is often used and is called the force–voltage analogy [21, 23].
Analogous systems with similar solutions exist for electrical, mechanical, ther￾mal, and fluid systems. The existence of analogous systems and solutions provides 
the analyst with the ability to extend the solution of one system to all analogous 
systems with the same describing differential equations. Therefore what one learns 
about the analysis and design of electrical systems is immediately extended to an 
understanding of fluid, thermal, and mechanical systems.
2.3 LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS OF PHYSICAL SYSTEMS
A great majority of physical systems are linear within some range of the variables. 
In general, systems ultimately become nonlinear as the variables are increased with￾out limit. For example, the spring-mass-damper system of Figure 2.2 is linear and 
described by Equation (2.1) as long as the mass is subjected to small deflections y(t). 
However, if y(t) were continually increased, eventually the spring would be overex￾tended and break. Therefore the question of linearity and the range of applicability 
must be considered for each system.
A system is defined as linear in terms of the system excitation and response. In 
the case of the electrical network, the excitation is the input current r(t) and the re￾sponse is the voltage υ(t). In general, a necessary condition for a linear system can be 
determined in terms of an excitation x t( ) and a response y t( ). When the system at rest 
is subjected to an excitation x t 1 ( ), it provides a response y t 1 ( ). Furthermore, when 
the system is subjected to an excitation x t 2 ( ), it provides a corresponding response 
y t 2 ( ). For a linear system, it is necessary that the excitation x t 1 2 ( ) + x t( ) result in a 
response y t 1 2 ( ) + y t( ). This is the principle of superposition.
Furthermore, the magnitude scale factor must be preserved in a linear system. 
Again, consider a system with an input x t( ) that results in an output y t( ). Then the 
response of a linear system to a constant multiple β of an input x must be equal to 
the response to the input multiplied by the same constant so that the output is equal 
to βy t( ). This is the property of homogeneity.
A linear system satisfies the properties of superposition and homogeneity.
A system characterized by the relation y t x t 2 ( ) = ( ) is not linear, because 
the superposition property is not satisfied. A system represented by the relation 
y t( ) = + mx( )t b is not linear, because it does not satisfy the homogene￾ity property. However, this second system may be considered linear about an 
M02_DORF2374_14_GE_C02.indd 85 13/09/21 8:09 PM86 Chapter 2 Mathematical Models of Systems
operating point x y 0 0 ,   for small changes ∆x and ∆y. When x t( ) = + x x 0 ∆ ( )t and 
y t( ) = + y y 0 ∆ ( )t , we have
y t( ) = + mx( )t b
or
y y 0 0 + ∆ ( )t m = + x m∆ + x t( ) b.
Therefore, ∆ = y t( ) m x ∆ ( )t , which satisfies the necessary conditions.
The linearity of many mechanical and electrical elements can be assumed over a 
reasonably large range of the variables [7]. This is not usually the case for thermal and 
fluid elements, which are more frequently nonlinear in character. Fortunately, how￾ever, one can often linearize nonlinear elements assuming small-signal conditions. 
This is the normal approach used to obtain a linear equivalent circuit for electronic 
circuits and transistors. Consider a general element with an excitation (through-) vari￾able x t( ) and a response (across-) variable y t( ). Several examples of dynamic system 
variables are given in Table 2.1. The relationship of the two variables is written as
y t( ) = g x( ) ( )t , (2.6)
where g(x(t)) indicates y t( ) is a function of x t( ). The normal operating point is 
designated by x0. Because the curve (function) is continuous over the range of 
interest, a Taylor series expansion about the operating point may be utilized [7]. 
Then we have

The slope at the operating point,

is a good approximation to the curve over a small range of x t( )− x0, the deviation from 
the operating point. Then, as a reasonable approximation, Equation (2.7) becomes
( ) = + ( ) ( ) ( )− = + − ( ) ( ) ( )= 0 0 0 0 . 0
y t g x dg
dx
x t x y m x t x x t x (2.8)
Finally, Equation (2.8) can be rewritten as the linear equation
y t( ) − = y m 0 0 ( ) x t( ) − x
or
∆ = y t( ) m x ∆ ( )t . (2.9)
Consider the case of a mass, M, sitting on a nonlinear spring, as shown in 
Figure 2.5(a). The normal operating point is the equilibrium position that occurs when the 
spring force balances the gravitational force Mg, where g is the gravitational constant. 
Thus, we obtain f M 0 = g, as shown. For the nonlinear spring with f t   , y t 2 ( ) = ( ) the 
equilibrium position is y M 0 g . 1/2 = ( ) The linear model for small deviation is
∆ = f t( ) m y ∆ ( )t ,

as shown in Figure 2.5(b). Thus, m y = 2 . 0 A linear approximation is as accurate as 
the assumption of small signals is applicable to the specific problem.
If the dependent variable y t( ) depends upon several excitation variables, 
x t 1 2 ( ),  x t( ),  …,  x t n ( ), then the functional relationship is written as
y t( ) = … g x( ) 1 2 ( )t x ,   ( )t x ,   ,   n ( )t . (2.10)
The Taylor series expansion about the operating point x x 1 2 0 0 ,   ,  …,  xn0 is useful for 
a linear approximation to the nonlinear function. When the higher-order terms are 
neglected, the linear approximation is written as

where x0 is the operating point. Example 2.1 will clearly illustrate the utility of this

EXAMPLE 2.1 Pendulum oscillator model
Consider the pendulum oscillator shown in Figure 2.6(a). The torque on the mass is
T t( ) = MgL t  sin  , θ( ) (2.12)
where g is the gravity constant. The equilibrium condition for the mass is θ0 = 0°.
The nonlinear relation between T t( ) and θ( )t is shown graphically in Figure 2.6(b).

where T0 = 0. Then, we have
T t( ) = MgL t θ( ). (2.13)
This approximation is reasonably accurate for − /π θ 4 4 ≤ ≤ π/ . For example, the 
response of the linear model for the swing through +−30° is within 5% of the actual 
nonlinear pendulum response. ■
2.4 THE LAPLACE TRANSFORM
The ability to obtain linear time-invariant approximations of physical systems allows 
the analyst to consider the use of the Laplace transformation. The Laplace trans￾form method substitutes relatively easily solved algebraic equations for the more 
difficult differential equations [1, 3]. The time-response solution is obtained by the 
following operations:
1. Obtain the linearized differential equations.
2. Obtain the Laplace transformation of the differential equations.
3. Solve the resulting algebraic equation for the transform of the variable of interest.
The Laplace transform exists for linear differential equations for which the trans￾formation integral converges. Therefore, for f t( ) to be transformable, it is sufficient that
f t e dt t ∫ ( ) σ < ∞
∞
−
−
  ,

for some real, positive σ1 [1]. The 0− indicates that the integral should include any dis￾continuity, such as a delta function at t = 0. If the magnitude of f(t) is f t Me t ( ) < α
for all positive t, the integral will converge for σ α 1 > . The region of convergence is 
therefore given by ∞ > σ α 1 > , and σ1 is known as the abscissa of absolute conver￾gence. Signals that are physically realizable always have a Laplace transform. The 
Laplace transformation for a function of time, f(t), is

transforms that are used for the great majority of problems. A table of important

The inverse Laplace transformation is usually obtained by using the Heaviside 
partial fraction expansion. This approach is particularly useful for systems analy￾sis and design because the effect of each characteristic root or eigenvalue can be 
clearly observed.
To illustrate the usefulness of the Laplace transformation and the steps involved 
in the system analysis, reconsider the spring-mass-damper system described by 
Equation (2.1), which is
M d y t
dt
b dy t
dt ky t r t . 2

( ) ( ) + + ( ) = ( ) (2.18)
We wish to obtain the response, y t( ), as a function of time. The Laplace transform 
of Equation (2.18) is
( ( ) − − ( ) ( )) ) + − ( ( ) ( ( ) + =) ( ) M s Y s − − − sy dy

Solving for Y s( ), we obtain

The denominator polynomial q s( ), when set equal to zero, is called the characteristic
equation because the roots of this equation determine the character of the time 
response. The roots of this characteristic equation are also called the poles of the 
system. The roots of the numerator polynomial p(s) are called the zeros of the sys￾tem; for example, s b = − /M is a zero of Equation (2.21). Poles and zeros are critical 
frequencies. At the poles, the function Y s( ) becomes infinite, whereas at the zeros, 
the function becomes zero. The complex frequency s-plane plot of the poles and zeros 
graphically portrays the character of the natural transient response of the system.
For a specific case, consider the system when k M/ 2 = and b M/ 3 = . Then 
Equation (2.21) becomes

Using Table 2.3, we find that

Finally, it is usually desired to determine the steady-state or final value of the 
response of y t( ). For example, the final or steady-state rest position of the spring￾mass-damper system may be calculated. The final value theorem states that
y t sY s t s
lim lim , 0 ( ) = ( ) →∞ →
(2.28)
where a simple pole of Y s( ) at the origin is permitted, but poles on the imagi￾nary axis and in the right half-plane and repeated poles at the origin are excluded. 
Therefore, for the specific case of the spring-mass-damper, we find that
y t sY s t s ( ) = = ( ) →∞ →
lim lim 0.

(2.29)
Hence the final position for the mass is the normal equilibrium position y = 0.

system. The roots of the characteristic equation are
= −ζω + ω ζ − s s 1 2 ,   n n − 1, 2 (2.31)
where, in this case, ωn = /k M and ζ = b k / 2( ) M . When ζ > 1, the roots are 
real and the system is overdamped; when ζ < 1, the roots are complex and the 
system is underdamped. When ζ = 1, the roots are repeated and real, and the con￾dition is called critical damping.
When ζ < 1, the response is underdamped, and

The solution, Equation (2.37), can also be obtained using item 11 of Table 2.3. The 
transient responses of the overdamped ( 1 ζ > ) and underdamped ( 1 ζ < ) cases 
are shown in Figure 2.12. The transient response that occurs when ζ < 1 exhibits 
an oscillation in which the amplitude decreases with time, and it is called a damped 
oscillation.
The relationship between the s-plane location of the poles and zeros and the 
form of the transient response can be interpreted from the s-plane pole–zero plots. 
For example, as seen in Equation (2.37), adjusting the value of ζωn varies the e−ζωnt
envelope, hence the response y t( ) shown in Figure 2.12. The larger the value of ζωn,
the faster the damping of the response, y t( ). In Figure 2.9, we see that the location 
of the complex pole s1 is given by s j 1 n n 1 . 2 = −ζω + − ω ζ So, making ζωn larger 
moves the pole further to the left in the s-plane. Thus, the connection between the 
location of the pole in the s-plane and the step response is apparent—moving the 
pole s1 farther in the left half-plane leads to a faster damping of the transient step 
response. Of course, most control systems will have more than one complex pair of 
poles, so the transient response will be the result of the contributions of all the poles. 
In fact, the magnitude of the response of each pole, represented by the residue, can 
be visualized by examining the graphical residues on the s-plane. We will discuss the

connection between the pole and zero locations and the transient and steady-state 
response more in subsequent chapters. We will find that the Laplace transformation 
and the s-plane approach are very useful techniques for system analysis and design 
where emphasis is placed on the transient and steady-state performance. In fact, 
because the study of control systems is concerned primarily with the transient and 
steady-state performance of dynamic systems, we have real cause to appreciate the 
value of the Laplace transform techniques.
2.5 THE TRANSFER FUNCTION OF LINEAR SYSTEMS
The transfer function of a linear system is defined as the ratio of the Laplace transform 
of the output variable to the Laplace transform of the input variable, with all initial 
conditions assumed to be zero. The transfer function of a system (or element) rep￾resents the relationship describing the dynamics of the system under consideration.
A transfer function may be defined only for a linear, stationary (constant 
parameter) system. A nonstationary system, often called a time-varying system, 
has one or more time-varying parameters, and the Laplace transformation may not 
be utilized. Furthermore, a transfer function is an input–output description of the 
behavior of a system. Thus, the transfer function description does not include any 
information concerning the internal structure of the system and its behavior.
The transfer function of the spring-mass-damper system is obtained from the 
original Equation (2.19), rewritten with zero initial conditions as follows:
Ms Y s bsY s kY s R s . 2 ( ) + + ( ) ( ) = ( ) (2.38)
Then the transfer function is the ratio of the output to the input, or

The transfer function of the RC network shown in Figure 2.13 is obtained by

the use of an uppercase letter or the argument (s).

A multiloop electrical circuit or an analogous multiple-mass mechanical 
system results in a set of simultaneous equations in the Laplace variable. It is usu￾ally more convenient to solve the simultaneous equations by using matrices and 
determinants [1, 3, 15]. An introduction to matrices and determinants can be found 
in many references online, as well as on the MCS website.
Let us consider the long-term behavior of a system and determine the response 
to certain inputs that remain after the transients fade away. Consider the dynamic

partial fraction expansion of the terms involving factors of q s( ), and Y s 3 ( ) is 
the partial fraction expansion of terms involving factors of d s( ).
Taking the inverse Laplace transform yields
y t( ) = + y t 1 2 ( ) y t( ) + y t 3 ( ).
The transient response consists of y t 1 2 ( ) + y t( ), and the steady-state response is 
y t 3 ( ).

EXAMPLE 2.3 Transfer function of an op-amp circuit
The operational amplifier (op-amp) belongs to an important class of analog inte￾grated circuits commonly used as building blocks in the implementation of control 
systems and in many other important applications. Op-amps are active elements 
(that is, they have external power sources) with a high gain when operating in their 
linear regions. A model of an ideal op-amp is shown in Figure 2.14.
M02_DORF2374_14_GE_C02.indd 97 13/09/21 8:10 PM98 Chapter 2 Mathematical Models of Systems
The operating conditions for the ideal op-amp are (1) i1 = 0 and i2 = 0, thus 
implying that the input impedance is infinite, and (2) υ υ 2 1 − = 0 (or υ υ 1 2 = ). The 
input–output relationship for an ideal op-amp is
υ υ 0 2 = − K K ( ) υ υ 1 1 = − ( ) − υ2 ,
where the gain K approaches infinity. In our analysis, we will assume that the linear 
op-amps are operating with high gain and under idealized conditions.
Consider the inverting amplifier shown in Figure 2.15. Under ideal conditions, 
we have i1 = 0, so that writing the node equation at υ1 yields
R R
0. 1 in

2
υ υ − υ υ
+ − =
Since υ υ 2 1 = (under ideal conditions) and υ2 = 0 (see Figure 2.15 and compare it 
with Figure 2.14), it follows that υ1 = 0. Therefore,
R R     0, in

υ υ − − =
and rearranging terms, we obtain
R
R . 0

We see that when R R 2 1 = , the ideal op-amp circuit inverts the sign of the input, 
that is, υ υ 0 i = − n when R R 2 1 = . ■

As an example, let us obtain the transfer function of an important electrical 
control component, the DC motor [8]. A DC motor is used to move loads and is 
called an actuator.
An actuator is a device that provides the motive power to the process.
EXAMPLE 2.5 Transfer function of the DC motor
The DC motor is a power actuator device that delivers energy to a load, as shown 
in Figure 2.18(a); a sketch of a DC motor is shown in Figure 2.18(b). The DC motor 
converts direct current (DC) electrical energy into rotational mechanical energy. 
A major fraction of the torque generated in the rotor (armature) of the motor is 
available to drive an external load. Because of features such as high torque, speed 
controllability over a wide range, portability, well-behaved speed–torque char￾acteristics, and adaptability to various types of control methods, DC motors are 
widely used in numerous control applications, including robotic manipulators, tape 
transport mechanisms, disk drives, machine tools, and servovalve actuators.
The transfer function of the DC motor will be developed for a linear approx￾imation to an actual motor, and second-order effects, such as hysteresis and the 
voltage drop across the brushes, will be neglected. The input voltage may be applied 
to the field or armature terminals. The air-gap flux φ( )t of the motor is proportional 
to the field current, provided the field is unsaturated, so that
t K i t f f φ( ) = ( ). (2.53)
The torque developed by the motor is assumed to be related linearly to φ( )t and the 
armature current as follows:
T t m a K t i t K K i t i t ( ) = = 1 1 φ( ) ( ) f f ( ) a ( ). (2.54)
M02_DORF2374_14_GE_C02.indd 100 13/09/21 8:10 PMSection 2.5 The Transfer Function of Linear Systems 101
It is clear from Equation (2.54) that, to have a linear system, one current must 
be maintained constant while the other current becomes the input current. First, 
we shall consider the field current controlled motor, which provides a substantial 
power amplification. Then we have, in Laplace transform notation,
T s m f ( ) = = ( ) K K1 I I a f ( )s Km f I s( ), (2.55)
where i I a a = is a constant armature current, and Km is defined as the motor con￾stant. The field current is related to the field voltage as
V s f f ( ) = + ( ) R Lf f s I ( )s . (2.56)
The motor torque T s m ( ) is equal to the torque delivered to the load. This relation 
may be expressed as
T s m L ( ) = + T s( ) T s d ( ), (2.57)
where T s L ( ) is the load torque and T s d ( ) is the disturbance torque, which is often 
negligible. However, the disturbance torque often must be considered in systems 
subjected to external forces such as antenna wind-gust forces. The load torque for 
rotating inertia, as shown in Figure 2.18, is written as
T s L Js s bs s . 2 ( ) = + θ θ ( ) ( ) (2.58)
Rearranging Equations (2.55)–(2.57), we have
T s L m ( ) = − T s( ) T s d ( ), (2.59)
 T s m m ( ) = K If ( )s , (2.60)

where τ f f = / L Rf and τL = /J b. Typically, one finds that τ τ L f > and often the 
field time constant may be neglected.
The armature-controlled DC motor uses the armature current ia as the control 
variable. The stator field can be established by a field coil and current or a perma￾nent magnet. When a constant field current is established in a field coil, the motor 
torque is
T s m f ( ) = = ( ) K K1 I I f a ( )s Km aI s( ). (2.64)
When a permanent magnet is used, we have
T s m m ( ) = K Ia ( )s ,
where Km is a function of the permeability of the magnetic material.
The armature current is related to the input voltage applied to the armature by
V s a a ( ) = + ( ) R La a s I ( )s V + b ( )s , (2.65)
where V s b ( ) is the back electromotive-force voltage proportional to the motor 
speed. Therefore, we have
V s b b ( ) = K s ω( ), (2.66)

The relations for the armature-controlled DC motor are shown schematically in 
Figure 2.20. Using Equations (2.64), (2.67), and (2.68) or the block diagram, and

where the equivalent time constant τ1 = / R Ja a ( ) R b + K Kb m .
Note that Km is equal to Kb. This equality may be shown by considering the 
steady-state motor operation and the power balance when the rotor resistance is 
neglected. The power input to the rotor is K t b a ω( )i t( ), and the power delivered to 
the shaft is T t( )ω( )t . In the steady-state condition, the power input is equal to the 
power delivered to the shaft so that K t b a ω ω ( )i t( ) = T t( ) ( )t ; since T t( ) = K i m a ( )t
(Equation 2.64), we find that K K b m = . ■
The transfer function concept and approach is very important because it pro￾vides the analyst and designer with a useful mathematical model of the system 
elements. We shall find the transfer function to be a continually valuable aid in the 
attempt to model dynamic systems. The approach is particularly useful because the 
s-plane poles and zeros of the transfer function represent the transient response of 
the system. The transfer functions of several dynamic elements are given in Table 2.4.
In many situations in engineering, the transmission of rotary motion from one 
shaft to another is a fundamental requirement. For example, the output power of an 
automobile engine is transferred to the driving wheels by means of the gearbox and 
differential. The gearbox allows the driver to select different gear ratios depending on 
the traffic situation, whereas the differential has a fixed ratio. The speed of the engine 
in this case is not constant, since it is under the control of the driver. Another exam￾ple is a set of gears that transfer the power at the shaft of an electric motor to the shaft 
of a rotating antenna. Examples of mechanical converters are gears, chain drives, and 
belt drives. A commonly used electric converter is the electric transformer. An exam￾ple of a device that converts rotational motion to linear motion is the rack-and-pinion 
gear shown in Table 2.4, item 17.

2.6 BLOCK DIAGRAM MODELS
The dynamic systems that comprise feedback control systems are typically repre￾sented mathematically by a set of simultaneous differential equations. As we have 
noted in the previous sections, the Laplace transformation reduces the problem to 
the solution of a set of linear algebraic equations. Since control systems are concerned 
with the control of specific variables, the controlled variables must relate to the con￾trolling variables. This relationship is typically represented by the transfer function of 
the subsystem relating the input and output variables. Therefore, one can correctly 
assume that the transfer function is an important relation for control engineering.
M02_DORF2374_14_GE_C02.indd 107 13/09/21 8:10 PM108 Chapter 2 Mathematical Models of Systems
The importance of this cause-and-effect relationship is evidenced by the facility 
to represent the relationship of system variables graphically using block diagrams. 
Block diagrams consist of unidirectional, operational blocks that represent the 
transfer function of the systems of interest. A block diagram of a field-controlled 
DC motor and load is shown in Figure 2.21. The relationship between the displace￾ment θ( )s and the input voltage V s f ( ) is represented in the block diagram.
To represent a system with several variables under control, an interconnection 
of blocks is utilized. For example, the system shown in Figure 2.22 has two input 
variables and two output variables [6]. Using transfer function relations, we can 
write the simultaneous equations for the output variables as
Y s 1 1 ( ) = + G s 1 1 ( )R s( ) G s 12 ( )R s 2 ( ), (2.71)
and
Y s 2 2 ( ) = + G s 1 1 ( )R s( ) G s 22 ( )R s 2 ( ), (2.72)
where G s ij( ) is the transfer function relating the ith output variable to the jth input vari￾able. The block diagram representing this set of equations is shown in Figure 2.23. In 
general, for J inputs and I outputs, we write the simultaneous equation in matrix form as

Here the Y( )s and R( )s matrices are column matrices containing the I output and 
the J input variables, respectively, and G( )s is an I by J transfer function matrix. 
The matrix representation of the interrelationship of many variables is particularly 
valuable for complex multi-variable control systems. Background information on 
matrix algebra can be found on-line and in many references, for example in [21].
The block diagram representation of a given system often can be reduced to 
a simplified block diagram with fewer blocks than the original diagram. Since the 
transfer functions represent linear systems, the multiplication is commutative. Thus, 
in Table 2.5, item 1, we have
X s 3 2 ( ) = = G s( )X s 2 2 ( ) G s( )G s 1 1 ( )X s( ).

When two blocks are connected in cascade, as in Table 2.5, item 1, we assume that
X s 3 2 ( ) = G s( )G s 1 1 ( )X s( )
holds true. This assumes that when the first block is connected to the second block, 
the effect of loading of the first block is negligible. Loading and interaction between 
interconnected components or systems may occur. If the loading of interconnected 
devices does occur, the engineer must account for this change in the transfer func￾tion and use the corrected transfer function in subsequent calculations.
Block diagram transformations and reduction techniques are derived by 
considering the algebra of the diagram variables. For example, consider the block 
diagram shown in Figure 2.24. This negative feedback control system is described 
by the equation for the actuating signal, which is
E s a ( ) = − R s( ) B s( ) = − R s( ) H s( )Y s( ). (2.75)
Because the output is related to the actuating signal by G s( ), we have
Y s( ) = = G s( )U s( ) G s( )G s a a ( )Z s( ) = G s( )G s( )G s c a ( )E s( ); (2.76)
thus,
Y s( ) = − G s( )G s a c ( )G s( )[ ] R s( ) H s( )Y s( ) . (2.77)
Combining the Y s( ) terms, we obtain
Y s( )[ ] 1 ( + = G s) ( G s a c ) ( G s) ( H s) ( G s) ( G s a c ) ( G s) ( R s). (2.78)
Therefore, the closed-loop transfer function relating the output Y s( ) to the input 
R s( ) is

The reduction of the block diagram shown in Figure 2.24 to a single block 
representation is one example of several useful techniques. These diagram trans￾formations are given in Table 2.5. All the transformations in Table 2.5 can be 
derived by algebraic manipulation of the equations representing the blocks. System 
analysis by the method of block diagram reduction affords a better understanding 
of the contribution of each component element than possible by the manipulation 
of equations. The utility of the block diagram transformations will be illustrated by 
an example using block diagram reduction.

EXAMPLE 2.6 Block diagram reduction
The block diagram of a multiple-loop feedback control system is shown in 
Figure 2.25. It is interesting to note that the feedback signal H s 1 ( )Y s( ) is a positive 
feedback signal, and the loop G s 3 4 ( )G s( )H s 1 ( ) is a positive feedback loop. The 
block diagram reduction procedure is based on the use of Table 2.5, transformation 
6, which eliminates feedback loops. Therefore the other transformations are used 
to transform the diagram to a form ready for eliminating feedback loops. First, to 
eliminate the loop G s 3 4 ( )G s( )H s 1 ( ), we move H s 2 ( ) behind block G s 4 ( ) by using 
transformation 4, and obtain Figure 2.26(a). Eliminating the loop G s 3 4 ( )G s( )H s 1 ( )
by using transformation 6, we obtain Figure 2.26(b). Then, eliminating the inner 
loop containing H s 2 4 ( )/ , G s( ) we obtain Figure 2.26(c). Finally, by reducing the 
loop containing H s 3 ( ), we obtain the closed-loop system transfer function as shown 
in Figure 2.26(d). It is worthwhile to examine the form of the numerator and de￾nominator of this closed-loop transfer function. We note that the numerator is 
composed of the cascade transfer function of the feedforward elements connecting 
the input R s( ) and the output Y s( ). The denominator is composed of 1 minus the 
sum of each loop transfer function. The loop G s 3 4 ( )G s( )H s 1 ( ) has a plus sign in 
the sum to be subtracted because it is a positive feedback loop, whereas the loops 
G s 1 2 ( )G s( )G s 3 4 ( )G s( )H s 3 ( ) and G s 2 3 ( )G s( )H s 2 ( ) are negative feedback loops. 
To illustrate this point, the denominator can be rewritten as
q s( ) = −1 ( ) + − G s 3 4 ( )G s( )H s 1 2 ( ) G s( )G s 3 2 ( )H s( ) − G s 1 2 ( )G s( )G s 3 4 ( )G s( )H s 3 ( ) .
(2.80)
This form of the numerator and denominator is quite close to the general form for 
multiple-loop feedback systems, as we shall find in the following section. ■
The block diagram representation of feedback control systems is a valuable 
and widely used approach. The block diagram provides the analyst with a graph￾ical representation of the system interrelationships. Furthermore, the designer 
can readily visualize the possibilities for adding blocks to the existing system 
block diagram to alter and improve the system performance. The transition 
from the block diagram method to a method utilizing a line path representation 
instead of a block representation is readily accomplished and is presented in the 
following section.

2.7 SIGNAL-FLOW GRAPH MODELS
Block diagrams are adequate for the representation of the interrelationships of con￾trolled and input variables. An alternative method for determining the relationship 
between system variables has been developed by Mason and is based on a represen￾tation of the system by line segments [4, 25]. The advantage of the line path method, 
called the signal-flow graph method, is the availability of a flow graph gain formula, 
which provides the relation between system variables without requiring any reduc￾tion procedure or manipulation of the flow graph.
The transition from a block diagram representation to a directed line segment 
representation is easy to accomplish by reconsidering the systems of the previous 
section. A signal-flow graph is a diagram consisting of nodes that are connected by 
several directed branches and is a graphical representation of a set of linear rela￾tions. Signal-flow graphs are particularly useful for feedback control systems be￾cause feedback theory is primarily concerned with the flow and processing of signals 
in systems. The basic element of a signal-flow graph is a unidirectional path segment 
called a branch, which relates the dependency of an input and an output variable in a 
manner equivalent to a block of a block diagram. Therefore, the branch relating the 
output θ( )s of a DC motor to the field voltage V s f ( ) is similar to the block diagram

of Figure 2.21 and is shown in Figure 2.27. The input and output points or junctions 
are called nodes. Similarly, the signal-flow graph representing Equations (2.71) and 
(2.72), as well as Figure 2.23, is shown in Figure 2.28. The relation between each 
variable is written next to the directional arrow. All branches leaving a node will pass 
the nodal signal to the output node of each branch (unidirectionally). The summa￾tion of all signals entering a node is equal to the node variable. A path is a branch or 
a continuous sequence of branches that can be traversed from one signal (node) to 
another signal (node). A loop is a closed path that originates and terminates on the 
same node, with no node being met twice along the path. Two loops are said to be 
nontouching if they do not have a common node. Two touching loops share one or 
more common nodes. Therefore, considering Figure 2.28 again, we obtain
Y s 1 1 ( ) = + G s 1 1 ( )R s( ) G s 12 ( )R s 2 ( ), (2.81)
and
Y s 2 2 ( ) = + G s 1 1 ( )R s( ) G s 22 ( )R s 2 ( ). (2.82)
The flow graph is a graphical method of writing a system of algebraic equations 
that indicates the interdependencies of the variables. As another example, consider 
the following set of simultaneous algebraic equations:
a x 11 1 1 + + a x2 2 r x 1 1 = (2.83)
a x 21 1 2 + + a x2 2 r x 2 2 = . (2.84)
The two input variables are r1 and r2, and the output variables are x1 and x2. A 
signal-flow graph representing Equations (2.83) and (2.84) is shown in Figure 2.29. 
Equations (2.83) and (2.84) may be rewritten as
x a 1 1 ( ) 1 , − + 1 2 x a ( ) − = 12 r1 (2.85)
and
x a 1 2 ( ) − + 1 2 x a ( ) 1 . − = 22 r2 (2.86)

The denominator of the solution is the determinant ∆ of the set of equations and 
is rewritten as
∆ = ( ) 1 1 − − a a 11 ( ) 22 − = a a 12 21 1 . − − a a 11 22 + − a a 11 22 a a 12 21 (2.89)
In this case, the denominator is equal to 1 minus each self-loop a11, a22, and a12a21, 
plus the product of the two nontouching loops a11 and a22. The loops a22 and a21a12
are touching, as are a11 and a21a12.
The numerator for x1 with the input r1 is 1 times 1 , − a22 which is the value of ∆
excluding terms that touch the path 1 from r1 to x1. Therefore the numerator from 
r2 to x1 is simply a12 because the path through a12 touches all the loops. The numer￾ator for x2 is symmetrical to that of x1.
In general, the linear dependence T s ij( ) between the independent variable xi
(often called the input variable) and a dependent variable xj is given by Mason’s 
signal-flow gain formula [11, 12],

P s ijk ( ) = gain of kth path from variable xi to variable xj,
∆ = ( )s determinant of the graph,
∆ = ijk ( )s cofactor of the path P s ijk ( ),
and the summation is taken over all possible k paths from xi to xj. The path gain or 
transmittance P s ijk ( ) is defined as the product of the gains of the branches of the 
path, traversed in the direction of the arrows with no node encountered more than 
once. The cofactor ∆ijk ( )s is the determinant with the loops touching the kth path 
removed. The determinant ∆( )s is

The gain formula is often used to relate the output variable Y s( ) to the input

where T s( ) = / Y s( ) R s( ).
Several examples will illustrate the utility and ease of this method. Although 
the gain Equation (2.90) appears to be formidable, one must remember that it rep￾resents a summation process, not a complicated solution process.

A similar analysis can be accomplished using block diagram reduction 
techniques. The block diagram shown in Figure 2.30(b) has four inner feedback 
loops within the overall block diagram. The block diagram reduction is simplified 
by first reducing the four inner feedback loops and then placing the resulting sys￾tems in series. Along the top path, the transfer function is

This diagram was obtained from Equations (2.64)–(2.68). The signal-flow diagram

describes modeling of a photovoltaic generator in a manner amenable to feedback 
control to achieve maximum power delivery as the sunlight varies over time. Using 
feedback control to improve the efficiency of producing electricity using solar energy 
in areas of abundant sunlight is a valuable contribution to green engineering. In the 
second example, we present a detailed look at modeling of the fluid level in a reser￾voir. The modeling is presented in a very detailed manner to emphasize the effort 
required to obtain a linear model in the form of a transfer function. The remaining 
two examples include an electric traction motor model development and the design 
of a low-pass filter.
EXAMPLE 2.11 Photovoltaic generators
Photovoltaic cells were developed at Bell Laboratories in 1954. Solar cells are one 
example of photovoltaic cells and convert solar light to electricity. Other types of pho￾tovoltaic cells can detect radiation and measure light intensity. The use of solar cells to 
produce energy supports the principles of green engineering by minimizing pollution. 
Solar panels minimize the depletion of natural resources and are effective in areas 
where sunlight is abundant. Photovoltaic generators are systems that provide electricity 
using an assortment of photovoltaic modules comprised of interconnected solar cells. 
Photovoltaic generators can be used to recharge batteries, they can be directly con￾nected to an electrical grid, or they can drive electric motors without a battery [34–42].
The power output of a solar cell varies with available solar light, temperature, 
and external loads. To increase the overall efficiency of the photovoltaic generator, 
feedback control strategies can be employed to seek to maximize the power output. 
This is known as maximum power point tracking (MPPT) [34–36]. There are certain 
values of current and voltage associated with the solar cells corresponding to the 
maximum power output. The MPPT uses closed-loop feedback control to seek the 
optimal point to allow the power converter circuit to extract the maximum power 
from the photovoltaic generator system. We will discuss the control design in later 
chapters, but here we focus on the modeling of the system.
The solar cell can be modeled as an equivalent circuit shown in Figure 2.33 
composed of a current generator, IPH, a light sensitive diode, a resistance series, Rs, 
and a shunt resistance, RP [34, 36–38].

where the photovoltaic generator is comprised of M parallel strings with N series 
cells per string, I0 is the reverse saturation current of the diode, IPH represents 
the insolation level, and λ is a known constant that depends on the cell material 
[34–36]. The insolation level is a measure of the amount of incident solar radiation 
on the solar cells.
Suppose that we have a single silicon solar panel ( ) M = 1 with 10 series cells 
( ) N = 10 and the parameters given by 1/ =λ 0.05 V, Rs = Ω 0.025 , IPH = 3 A, and 
I0 = 0.001 A. The voltage versus current relationship in Equation (2.99) and the 
power versus voltage are shown in Figure 2.34 for one particular insolation level 
where IPH = 3 A. In Figure 2.34, we see that when dP/ 0 dIPV = we are at the 
maximum power level with an associated V V PV = mp and I I PV = mp, the values of 
voltage and current at the maximum power, respectively. As the sunlight varies, the 
insolation level, IPH, varies resulting in different power curves.
The goal of the power point tracking is to seek the voltage and current condition 
that maximizes the power output as conditions vary. This is accomplished by vary￾ing the reference voltage as a function of the insolation level. The reference voltage 
is the voltage at the maximum power point as shown in Figure 2.35. The feedback 
control system should track the reference voltage in a rapid and accurate fashion.
Figure 2.36 illustrates a simplified block diagram of the controlled system. The 
main components are a power circuit (e.g., a phase control IC and a thyristor 
bridge), photovoltaic generator, and current transducer. The plant including the

EXAMPLE 2.12 Fluid flow modeling
A fluid flow system is shown in Figure 2.37. The reservoir (or tank) contains water 
that evacuates through an output port. Water is fed to the reservoir through a pipe 
controlled by an input valve. The variables of interest are the fluid velocity V(m/s), 
fluid height in the reservoir H (m), and p ressure p (N/m ). 2 The pressure is defined 
as the force per unit area exerted by the fluid on a surface immersed (and at rest 
with respect to) the fluid. Fluid pressure acts normal to the surface. For further 
reading on fluid flow modeling, see [28–30].
The elements of the control system design process emphasized in this example 
are shown in Figure 2.38. The strategy is to establish the system configuration and 
then obtain the appropriate mathematical models describing the fluid flow reser￾voir from an input–output perspective.
The general equations of motion and energy describing fluid flow are quite 
complicated. The governing equations are coupled nonlinear partial differential 
equations. We must make some selective assumptions that reduce the complexity of 
the mathematical model. Although the control engineer is not required to be a fluid 
dynamicist, and a deep understanding of fluid dynamics is not necessarily acquired 
during the control system design process, it makes good engineering sense to gain at 
least a rudimentary understanding of the important simplifying assumptions. For a 
more complete discussion of fluid motion, see [31–33].
To obtain a realistic, yet tractable, mathematical model for the fluid flow reser￾voir, we first make several key assumptions. We assume that the water in the tank 
is incompressible and that the flow is inviscid, irrotational and steady. An incom￾pressible fluid has a constant density  (kg/m ). 3 ρ In fact, all fluids are compressible 
to some extent. The compressibility factor, k, is a measure of the compressibility of

a fluid. A smaller value of k indicates less compressibility. Air (which is a compress￾ible fluid) has a compressibility factor of kai 0.98 m N, r = /2 while water has a com￾pressibility factor of k = × − − / = × − H O 4.9 10  m N 50 10  atm . 10 2 6 1 2 In other words, 
a given volume of water decreases by 50 one-millionths of the original volume for 
each atmosphere (atm) increase in pressure. Thus the assumption that the water is 
incompressible is valid for our application.
Consider a fluid in motion. Suppose that initially the flow velocities are differ￾ent for adjacent layers of fluid. Then an exchange of molecules between the two 
layers tends to equalize the velocities in the layers. This is internal friction, and 
the exchange of momentum is known as viscosity. Solids are more viscous than 
fluids, and fluids are more viscous than gases. A measure of viscosity is the co￾efficient of viscosity μ (N s m/ ). 2 A larger coefficient of viscosity implies higher 
viscosity. The coefficient of viscosity (under standard conditions, 20°C) for air is 
ai 0.178 10  N s m , r 4 2 μ = × / − and for water we have μ = × / H O − 2 1.054 10  N s m . 3 2
Therefore water is about 60 times more viscous than air. Viscosity depends pri￾marily on temperature, not pressure. For comparison, water at 0°C is about 2 times

output ports.

more viscous than water at 20°C. With fluids of low viscosity, such as air and water, 
the effects of friction are important only in the boundary layer, a thin layer adjacent 
to the wall of the reservoir and output pipe. We can neglect viscosity in our model 
development. We say our fluid is inviscid.
If each fluid element at each point in the flow has no net angular velocity about 
that point, the flow is termed irrotational. Imagine a small paddle wheel immersed 
in the fluid (say in the output port). If the paddle wheel translates without rotating, 
the flow is irrotational. We will assume the water in the tank is irrotational. For an 
inviscid fluid, an initially irrotational flow remains irrotational.
The water flow in the tank and output port can be either steady or unsteady. 
The flow is steady if the velocity at each point is constant in time. This does not 
necessarily imply that the velocity is the same at every point but rather that at any 
given point the velocity does not change with time. Steady-state conditions can be 
achieved at low fluid speeds. We will assume steady flow conditions. If the output 
port area is too large, then the flow through the reservoir may not be slow enough 
to establish the steady-state condition that we are assuming exists and our model 
will not accurately predict the fluid flow motion.
To obtain a mathematical model of the flow within the reservoir, we employ 
basic principles of science and engineering, such as the principle of conservation of 
mass. The mass of water in the tank at any given time is
m t( ) = ρA H1 ( )t , (2.102)
where A1 is the area of the tank, ρ is the water density, and H t( ) is the height of the 
water in the reservoir. The constants for the reservoir system are given in Table 2.6.
In the following formulas, a subscript 1 denotes quantities at the input, and a 
subscript 2 refers to quantities at the output. Taking the time derivative of m t( ) in 
Equation (2.102) yields
m t A H ( ) = ρ 1 ( )t ,
where we have used the fact that our fluid is incompressible (that is, ρ = 0) and that 
the area of the tank, A1, does not change with time. The change in mass in the reser￾voir is equal to the mass that enters the tank minus the mass that leaves the tank, or
m t A H ( ) = = ρ ρ 1 1 ( )t Q ( )t A − 2 2 υ ( )t , (2.103)
where Q t 1 ( ) is the input mass flow rate, v t 2 ( ) is the exit velocity, and A2 is the 
output port area. The exit velocity, v t 2 ( ), is a function of the water height. From 
Bernoulli’s equation [39] we have

where υ1 is the water velocity at the mouth of the reservoir, and P1 and P2 are 
the atmospheric pressures at the input and output, respectively. But P1 and P2 are 
equal, and A2 is sufficiently small ( ) A A 2 1 = /100 , so the water flows out slowly and 
the velocity υ1 ( )t is negligible. Thus Bernoulli’s equation reduces to
υ2 ( )t g = 2 . H t( ) (2.104)

Equation (2.107) represents our model of the water tank system, where the input is 
Q t 1 ( ) and the output is Q t 2 ( ). Equation (2.107) is a nonlinear, first-order, ordinary 
differential equation model. The model in Equation (2.107) has the functional form

A set of linearized equations describing the height of the water in the reser￾voir is obtained using Taylor series expansions about an equilibrium flow condition. 
When the tank system is in equilibrium, we have H t  ( ) = 0. We can define Q* and 
H* as the equilibrium input mass flow rate and water level, respectively. The rela￾tionship between Q* and H* is given by

For control system design and analysis, it is convenient to obtain the input–output

Equation (2.116) describes the relationship between the change in the output mass

obtain a transfer function relationship between the change in the input mass flow 
rate and the change in the water level in the tank, ∆H s( ). Taking the Laplace trans￾form (with zero initial conditions) of Eq. (2.111) yields

Given the linear time-invariant model of the water tank system in Equation 
(2.115), we can obtain solutions for step and sinusoidal inputs. Remember that our 
input ∆Q s 1 ( ) is actually a change in the input mass flow rate from the steady-state 
value Q * .
Consider the step input
∆ = Q s 1 ( ) q s o/ ,
where qo is the magnitude of the step input, and the initial condition is ∆ = Q2 ( ) 0 0.

Q q 2 o. ∆ =ss
We see that in the steady state, the deviation of the output mass flow rate from 
the equilibrium value is equal to the deviation of the input mass flow rate from the 
equilibrium value. By examining the variable Ω in Equation (2.114), we find that 
the larger the output port opening A2, the faster the system reaches steady state. In 
other words, as Ω gets larger, the exponential term e−Ωt vanishes more quickly, and 
steady state is reached faster.

The above analytic analysis of the linear system model to step and sinusoidal 
inputs is a valuable way to gain insight into the system response to test signals. 
Analytic analysis is limited, however, in the sense that a more complete represen￾tation can be obtained with carefully constructed numerical investigations using 
computer simulations of both the linear and nonlinear mathematical models. A 
computer simulation uses a model and the actual conditions of the system being 
modeled, as well as actual input commands to which the system will be subjected.
Various levels of simulation fidelity (that is, accuracy) are available to the con￾trol engineer. In the early stages of the design process, highly interactive design 
software packages are effective. At this stage, computer speed is not as important as 
the time it takes to obtain an initial valid solution and to iterate and fine tune that 
solution. Good graphics output capability is crucial. The analysis simulations are 
generally low fidelity in the sense that many of the simplifications (such as lineariza￾tion) made in the design process are retained in the simulation.
As the design matures usually it is necessary to conduct numerical experiments 
in a more realistic simulation environment. At this point in the design process, the 
computer processing speed becomes more important, since long simulation times 
necessarily reduce the number of computer experiments that can be obtained and 
correspondingly raise costs. Usually these high-fidelity simulations are programmed 
in FORTRAN, C, C++, MATLAB, LabVIEW or similar languages.
Assuming that a model and the simulation are reliably accurate, computer sim￾ulation has the following advantages [13]:
1. System performance can be observed under all conceivable conditions.
2. Results of field-system performance can be extrapolated with a simulation model 
for prediction purposes.
3. Decisions concerning future systems presently in a conceptual stage can be 
examined.
4. Trials of systems under test can be accomplished in a much-reduced period of time.
5. Simulation results can be obtained at lower cost than real experimentation.
6. Study of hypothetical situations can be achieved even when the hypothetical situa￾tion would be unrealizable at present.
7. Computer modeling and simulation is often the only feasible or safe technique to 
analyze and evaluate a system.
The nonlinear model describing the water level flow rate is as follows (using the 
constants given in Table 2.6):
 ( ) = − ( ) + × ( ) H t 0.0443 H t 1.2732 10−   , Q t 3 1 (2.119)
Q t 2 ( ) = 34.77 H t( ).
M02_DORF2374_14_GE_C02.indd 129 13/09/21 8:12 PM130 Chapter 2 Mathematical Models of Systems
With H m ( ) 0 = 0.5 and Q t 1 ( ) = 34.77 kg/s, we can numerically integrate the non￾linear model given by Equation (2.119) to obtain the time history of H t( ). and Q t 2 ( ).
The response of the system is shown in Figure 2.39. As expected from Equation 
(2.108), the system steady-state water level is H* 1 =  m when Q* 34.77 kg/m . = 3
It takes about 250 seconds to reach steady-state. Suppose that the system is at 
steady state and we want to evaluate the response to a step change in the input mass 
flow rate. Consider
∆ = Q t 1 ( ) 1 kg/s.
Then we can use the transfer function model to obtain the unit step response. The 
step response is shown in Figure 2.40 for both the linear and nonlinear models. 
Using the linear model, we find that the steady-state change in water level is 
∆ = H 5.75 cm. Using the nonlinear model, we find that the steady-state change in 
water level is ∆ = H 5.84 cm. So we see a small difference in the results obtained 
from the linear model and the more accurate nonlinear model.
As the final step, we consider the system response to a sinusoidal change in the 
input flow rate. Let

EXAMPLE 2.13 Electric traction motor control
The electric motor drive is shown in block diagram form in Figure 2.43(a), incor￾porating the necessary control. The goal of the design is to obtain a system model 
and the closed-loop transfer function of the system, ω ω ( )s s / d ( ), select appropriate 
resistors R R 1 2 ,   ,  R3, and R4, and then predict the system response.
The first step is to describe the transfer function of each block. We propose 
the use of a tachometer to generate a voltage proportional to velocity and to con￾nect that voltage, t υ , to one input of a difference amplifier, as shown in Figure 
2.43(b). The power amplifier is nonlinear and can be approximately represented by 
2 t e2 ( t g ), 3 υ υ ( ) = = 1 1 ( ) υ an exponential function with a normal operating point, 
υ10 = 1.5 V. We then obtain a linear model

(underdamped). ■
EXAMPLE 2.14 Design of a low-pass filter
Our goal is to design a first-order low-pass filter that passes signals at a frequency 
below 106.1 Hz and attenuates signals with a frequency above 106.1 Hz. In addition, 
the DC gain should be / 1 2 .
A ladder network with one energy storage element, as shown in Figure 2.44(a), 
will act as a first-order low-pass network. Note that the DC gain will be equal to / 1 2
(open-circuit the capacitor). The current and voltage equations are

I V 2 2 = − ( ) V G3 ,  
V I 2 1 = − ( ) I R 2 ,
V I 3 2 = Z,
where G R = /1 and Z s( ) = /1 . Cs The signal-flow graph constructed for the four 
equations is shown in Figure 2.44(b), and the corresponding block diagram is shown 
in Figure 2.44(c). The three loops are L s 1 2 ( ) = −GR = −1,   1 L s( ) = −GR = − , and

2.9 THE SIMULATION OF SYSTEMS USING CONTROL DESIGN SOFTWARE
Application of the many classical and modern control system design and analy￾sis tools is based on mathematical models. Most popular control design software 
packages can be used with systems given in the form of transfer function 
descriptions. In this book, we will focus on m-file scripts containing commands 
and functions to analyze and design control systems. Various commercial con￾trol system packages are available for student use. The m-files described here 
are compatible with the MATLAB†
 Control System Toolbox and the LabVIEW 
MathScript RT Module.‡
†
See Appendix A for an introduction to MATLAB.

See Appendix B for an introduction to LabVIEW MathScipt RT Module.
M02_DORF2374_14_GE_C02.indd 136 13/09/21 8:12 PMSection 2.9 The Simulation of Systems Using Control Design Software 137
We begin this section by analyzing a typical spring-mass-damper mathematical 
model of a mechanical system. Using an m-file script, we will develop an interactive 
analysis capability to analyze the effects of natural frequency and damping on the 
unforced response of the mass displacement. This analysis will use the fact that we 
have an analytic solution that describes the unforced time response of the mass 
displacement.
Later, we will discuss transfer functions and block diagrams. In particular, we 
are interested in manipulating polynomials, computing poles and zeros of transfer 
functions, computing closed-loop transfer functions, computing block diagram re￾ductions, and computing the response of a system to a unit step input. The section 
concludes with the electric traction motor control design of Example 2.13.
The functions covered in this section are roots, poly, conv, polyval, tf, pzmap,
pole, zero, series, parallel, feedback, minreal, and step.
A spring-mass-damper mechanical system is shown in Figure 2.2. The motion of 
the mass, denoted by y t( ), is described by the differential equation
My  ( )t b + + y t( ) ky( )t r = ( )t .
The unforced dynamic response y t( ) of the spring-mass-damper mechanical system is

where ω ζ n = /k M,   = /b k ( ) 2 , M and cos   . 1 θ ζ = − The initial displacement 
is y( ) 0 . The transient system response is underdamped when ζ < 1, overdamped 
when ζ > 1, and critically damped when ζ = 1. We can visualize the unforced 
time response of the mass displacement following an initial displacement of y( ) 0 . 
Consider the underdamped case:

The commands to generate the plot of the unforced response are shown in 
Figure 2.45. In the setup, the variables y( ) 0 , ωn, t, and ζ are input at the command 
level. Then the script unforced.m is executed to generate the desired plots. This 
creates an interactive analysis capability to analyze the effects of natural frequency 
and damping on the unforced response of the mass displacement. One can investi￾gate the effects of the natural frequency and the damping on the time response by 
simply entering new values of ωn and ζ at the command prompt and running the 
script unforced.m again. The time-response plot is shown in Figure 2.46. Notice 
that the script automatically labels the plot with the values of the damping coeffi￾cient and natural frequency. This avoids confusion when making many interactive 
simulations. Using scripts is an important aspect of developing an effective interac￾tive design and analysis capability.
For the spring-mass-damper problem, the unforced solution to the differential 
equation was readily available. In general, when simulating closed-loop feedback 
M02_DORF2374_14_GE_C02.indd 137 13/09/21 8:12 PM138 Chapter 2 Mathematical Models of Systems
control systems subject to a variety of inputs and initial conditions, it is difficult to 
obtain the solution analytically. In these cases, we can compute the solutions nu￾merically and to display the solution graphically.
Most systems considered in this book can be described by transfer functions. 
Since the transfer function is a ratio of polynomials, we begin by investigating how to 
manipulate polynomials, remembering that working with transfer functions means 
that both a numerator polynomial and a denominator polynomial must be specified.

Polynomials are represented by row vectors containing the polynomial coeffi￾cients in order of descending degree. For example, the polynomial
p s s s 3 4 3 2 ( ) = + +
is entered as shown in Figure 2.47. Notice that even though the coefficient of the s
term is zero, it is included in the input definition of p(s).
If p is a row vector containing the coefficients of p(s) in descending degree, then 
roots(p) is a column vector containing the roots of the polynomial. Conversely, if 
r is a column vector containing the roots of the polynomial, then poly(r) is a row 
vector with the polynomial coefficients in descending degree. We can compute the 
roots of the polynomial p s s s 3 4 3 2 ( ) = + + with the roots function as shown in 
Figure 2.47. In this figure, we show how to reassemble the polynomial with the poly 
function.
Multiplication of polynomials is accomplished with the conv function. Suppose 
we want to expand the polynomial
n s 3 2 s s 1 4 s . 2 ( ) = + ( ) + + ( )
The associated commands using the conv function are shown in Figure 2.48. Thus, 
the expanded polynomial is

The function polyval is used to evaluate the value of a polynomial at the given 
value of the variable. The polynomial n s( ) has the value n( ) − = 5 6 − 6, as shown in 
Figure 2.48.
Linear, time-invariant system models can be treated as objects, allowing one to 
manipulate the system models as single entities. In the case of transfer functions, 
one creates the system models using the tf function; for state variable models one 
employs the ss function. The use of tf is illustrated in Figure 2.49(a). For example, 
consider the two system models

G s 1 ( ) and sys2 represents G s 2 ( ). Computing the poles and zeros associated with a 
transfer function is accomplished by operating on the system model object with the 
pole and zero functions, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 2.50.
In the next example, we obtain a plot of the pole–zero locations in the complex 
plane. This will be accomplished using the pzmap function, shown in Figure 2.51. 
On the pole–zero map, zeros are denoted by an “o” and poles are denoted by an 
“ ”× If the pzmap function is invoked without left-hand arguments, the plot is gen￾erated automatically.

This cannot be the case, since we know that for physical systems the number of poles 
must be greater than or equal to the number of zeros. Using the roots function, we 
can ascertain that there are in fact four poles at s = −1. Hence, multiple poles or 
multiple zeros at the same location cannot be discerned on the pole–zero map. ■

Suppose we have developed mathematical models in the form of transfer func￾tions for a process, represented by G s( ), and a controller, represented by G s c( ),
and possibly many other system components such as sensors and actuators. Our 
objective is to interconnect these components to form a control system.
A simple open-loop control system can be obtained by interconnecting a pro￾cess and a controller in series as illustrated in Figure 2.54. We can compute the 
transfer function from R s( ) to Y s( ), as follows.
EXAMPLE 2.16 Series connection

We can use the series function to cascade two transfer functions G s 1 ( ) and G s 2 ( ),
as shown in Figure 2.55.
The transfer function G s c ( )G s( ) is computed using the series function as shown 
in Figure 2.56. The resulting transfer function is

Block diagrams quite often have transfer functions in parallel. In such cases, the 
function parallel can be quite useful. The parallel function is described in Figure 2.57.
We can introduce a feedback signal into the control system by closing the loop 
with unity feedback, as shown in Figure 2.58. The signal E s a ( ) is an error signal; 
the signal R s( ) is a reference input. In this control system, the controller is in the 
forward path, and the closed-loop transfer function is

We can utilize the feedback function to aid in the block diagram reduction pro￾cess to compute closed-loop transfer functions for single- and multiple-loop control 
systems.
It is often the case that the closed-loop control system has unity feedback, as 
illustrated in Figure 2.58. We can use the feedback function to compute the closed￾loop transfer function by setting H s( ) = 1. The use of the feedback function for 
unity feedback is depicted in Figure 2.59.
The feedback function is shown in Figure 2.60 with the associated system con￾figuration, which includes H s( ) in the feedback path. If the input “sign” is omitted, 
then negative feedback is assumed.

EXAMPLE 2.17 The feedback function with unity feedback
Let the process, G s( ), and the controller, G s c ( ), be as in Figure 2.61(a). To apply the 
feedback function, we first use the series function to compute G s c ( )G s( ), followed 
by the feedback function to close the loop. The command sequence is shown in

We must be careful in calling this the closed-loop transfer function. The transfer 
function is defined as the input–output relationship after pole–zero cancellations. 
If we compute the poles and zeros of T s( ), we find that the numerator and denom￾inator polynomials have ( 1 s + ) as a common factor. This must be canceled before 
we can claim we have the closed-loop transfer function. To assist us in the pole–
zero cancellation, we will use the minreal function. The minreal function, shown 
in Figure 2.65, removes common pole–zero factors of a transfer function. The final 
step in the block reduction process is to cancel out the common factors, as shown in 
Figure 2.66. After the application of the minreal function, we find that the order of 
the denominator polynomial has been reduced from six to five, implying one pole–
zero cancellation. ■

EXAMPLE 2.20 Electric traction motor control
Finally, let us reconsider the electric traction motor system from Example 2.13. The 
block diagram is shown in Figure 2.43(c). The objective is to compute the closed￾loop transfer function and investigate the response of ω( )s to a commanded ωd ( )s .
The first step, as shown in Figure 2.67, is to compute the closed-loop transfer func￾tion ω ω ( )s s / . d ( ) = T s( ) The closed-loop characteristic equation is second order 
with ωn = 52 and ζ = 0.012. Since the damping is low, we expect the response to 
be highly oscillatory. We can investigate the response ω( )t to a reference input, 
ωd ( )t , by utilizing the step function. The step function, shown in Figure 2.68, calcu￾lates the unit step response of a linear system. The step function is very important, 
since control system performance specifications are often given in terms of the unit 
step response.
If the only objective is to plot the output, y t( ), we can use the step function 
without left-hand arguments and obtain the plot automatically with axis labels. If 
we need y t( ) for any purpose other than plotting, we must use the step function 
with left-hand arguments, followed by the plot function to plot y t( ). We define t as 
a row vector containing the times at which we wish the value of the output variable 
y t( ). We can also select t t , = final which results in a step response from t = 0 to 
t t = final and the number of intermediate points are selected automatically.

DC motor to rotate the reader arm. The DC motor is called a voice coil motor. 
The read head is mounted on a slider device, which is connected to the arm as shown 
in Figure 2.70. A flexure (spring metal) is used to enable the head to float above 
the disk at a gap of less than 100 nm. The thin-film head reads the magnetic flux 
and provides a signal to an amplifier. The error signal of Figure 2.71(a) is provided 
by reading the error from a prerecorded index track. Assuming an accurate read 
head, the sensor has a transfer function H s( ) = 1, as shown in Figure 2.71(b). The 
model of the permanent magnet DC motor and a linear amplifier is shown in Figure 
2.71(b). As a good approximation, we use the model of the armature-controlled 
DC motor as shown earlier in Figure 2.20 with Kb = 0. The model shown in Figure 
2.71(b) assumes that the flexure is entirely rigid and does not significantly flex. In 
future control designs, we should consider the model when the flexure cannot be 
assumed to be completely rigid.

2.11 SUMMARY
In this chapter, we have been concerned with quantitative mathematical mod￾els of control components and systems. The differential equations describing the 
dynamic performance of physical systems were utilized to construct a mathemat￾ical model. The physical systems under consideration can include a wide-range of 
mechanical, electrical, biomedical, environmental, aerospace, industrial, and chem￾ical engineering systems. A linear approximation using a Taylor series expansion 
about the operating point was utilized to obtain a small-signal linear approxima￾tion for nonlinear control components. Then, with the approximation of a linear 
system, one may utilize the Laplace transformation and its related input–output 
relationship given by the transfer function. The transfer function approach to linear 
systems allows the analyst to determine the response of the system to various input 
signals in terms of the location of the poles and zeros of the transfer function. Using 
transfer function notations, block diagram models of systems of interconnected 
components were developed. The block relationships were obtained. Additionally, 
an alternative use of transfer function models in signal-flow graph form was inves￾tigated. Mason’s signal-flow gain formula was presented and found to be useful for 
obtaining the relationship between system variables in a complex feedback system. 
The advantage of the signal-flow graph method was the availability of Mason’s sig￾nal-flow gain formula, which provides the relationship between system variables 
without requiring any reduction or manipulation of the flow graph. Thus, we have

obtained a useful mathematical model for feedback control systems by developing 
the concept of a transfer function of a linear system and the relationship among sys￾tem variables using block diagram and signal-flow graph models. We considered the 
utility of the computer simulation of linear and nonlinear systems to determine the 
response of a system for several conditions of the system parameters and the envi￾ronment. Finally, we continued the development of the Disk Drive Read System by 
obtaining a model in transfer function form of the motor and arm.

a capacitor more rapidly [24]. The capacitor voltage 
controls the lamp voltage directly. A block diagram of

Sketch a signal-flow graph for these causal relation￾ships, using appropriate gain symbols. Indicate whether

An example of a practical system similar to that 
shown occurs in textile fiber manufacturing processes 
when yarn is wound from one spool to another at high 
speed. Between the two spools, the yarn is processed 
in a way that may require the yarn speed and tension 
to be controlled within defined limits. A model of the 
system is shown in Figure P2.32. Find Y s( )/R s( ). 2 1

P2.38 A winding oscillator consists of two steel spheres 
on each end of a long slender rod, as shown in Figure 
P2.38. The rod is hung on a thin wire that can be 
twisted many revolutions without breaking. The de￾vice will be wound up 4000 degrees. How long will 
it take until the motion decays to a swing of only 10 
degrees? Assume that the thin wire has a rotational

CDP2.1 We want to accurately position a table for a

motor with a capstan roller possesses several desirable 
characteristics compared to the more popular ball screw. 
The traction drive exhibits low friction and no backlash. 
However, it is susceptible to disturbances. Develop a

for the parameters given in Table CDP2.1. The drive 
uses a DC armature-controlled motor with a capstan 
roller attached to the shaft. The drive bar moves the 
linear slide-table. The slide uses an air bearing, so its

consider physical systems described by an nth-order ordinary differential equa￾tion. Utilizing a (nonunique) set of variables, known as state variables, we can ob￾tain a set of first-order differential equations. We group these first-order equations 
using a compact matrix notation in a model known as the state variable model.

3.1 INTRODUCTION
In the preceding chapter, we developed and studied several useful approaches to the 
analysis and design of feedback systems. The Laplace transform was used to trans￾form the differential equations representing the system to an algebraic equation 
expressed in terms of the complex variable s. Using this algebraic equation, we were 
able to obtain a transfer function representation of the input–output relationship.
In this chapter, we represent system models utilizing a set of ordinary differential 
equations in a convenient matrix-vector form. The time domain is the mathematical 
domain that incorporates the description of the system, including the inputs, outputs, 
and response, in terms of time, t. Linear time-invariant single-input, single-output 
models, can be represented via state variable models. Powerful mathematical con￾cepts from linear algebra and matrix-vector analysis, as well as effective computa￾tional tools, can be utilized in the design and analysis of control systems in the time 
domain. Also, these time domain design and analysis methods are readily extended 
to nonlinear, time-varying, and multiple input–output systems. As we shall see, math￾ematical models of linear time-invariant physical systems can be represented in either 
the frequency domain or the time domain. The time domain design techniques are 
another tool in the designer’s toolbox.
A time-varying control system is a system in which one or more of the 
parameters of the system may vary as a function of time.
For example, the mass of an airplane varies as a function of time as the fuel is 
expended during flight. A multivariable system is a system with several input and 
output signals.
The time-domain representation of control systems is an essential basis for 
modern control theory and system optimization. In later chapters, we will have an 
opportunity to design optimum control systems by utilizing time-domain methods. 
In this chapter, we develop the time-domain representation of control systems and 
illustrate several methods for the solution of the system time response.
3.2 THE STATE VARIABLES OF A DYNAMIC SYSTEM
The time-domain analysis and design of control systems uses the concept of the 
state of a system [1–3, 5].
The state of a system is a set of variables whose values, together with the 
input signals and the equations describing the dynamics, will provide the 
future state and output of the system.
For a dynamic system, the state of a system is described in terms of a set of 
state  variables x( )t x = ( ) 1 2 ( )t x ,   ( )t x ,...,   . n ( )t The state variables are those vari￾ables that determine the future behavior of a system when the present state of the 
M03_DORF2374_14_GE_C03.indd 185 14/09/21 9:54 AM186 Chapter 3 State Variable Models
system and the inputs are known. Consider the system shown in Figure 3.1, where 
y t( ) is the output signal and u t( ) is the input signal. A set of state variables 
x t( ) = ( ) x t 1 2 ( ),  x t( ),..., x t n ( ) for the system shown in the figure is a set such that knowl￾edge of the initial values of the state variables x t( ) 0 1 = ( ) x t( ) 0 2 , , x t( ) 0 0 ..., x t n ( ) at 
the initial time t0, and of the input signal u t( ) for t t ≥ 0, suffices to determine the 
future values of the outputs and state variables [2].
The concept of a set of state variables that represent a dynamic system can be 
illustrated in terms of the spring-mass-damper system shown in Figure 3.2. The 
number of state variables chosen to represent this system should be as small as 
possible in order to avoid redundant state variables. A set of state variables suf￾ficient to describe this system includes the position and the velocity of the mass. 
Therefore, we will define a set of state variables as x t( ) = ( ) x t 1 2 ( ),  x t( ) , where
1 2 ( ) ( ) and . ( ) ( ) x t = = y t x t dy t
dt
The differential equation describes the behavior of the system and can be written as

To write Equation (3.1) in terms of the state variables, we substitute the state vari￾ables as already defined and obtain
. 2
2 1

Therefore, we can write the equations that describe the behavior of the spring￾mass-damper system as the set of two first-order differential equations

This set of differential equations describes the behavior of the state of the system in 
terms of the rate of change of each state variable.
As another example of the state variable characterization of a system, consider 
the RLC circuit shown in Figure 3.3. The state of this system can be described by 
a set of state variables x( )t x = ( ) 1 2 ( )t x ,   ( )t , where x t 1 ( ) is the capacitor voltage

v t c ( ) and x t 2 ( ) is the inductor current i t L ( ). This choice of state variables is intu￾itively satisfactory because the stored energy of the network can be described in 
terms of these variables as

  . 2 2 e Li t C t = + L( ) υc ( ) (3.5)
Therefore x t 1 0 ( ) and x t 2 0 ( ) provide the total initial energy of the network and 
the state of the system at t t = 0. For a passive RLC network, the number of state 
variables required is equal to the number of independent energy-storage elements. 
Utilizing Kirchhoff’s current law at the junction, we obtain a first-order differential 
equation by describing the rate of change of capacitor voltage as
υ ( ) ( ) i t = = C + − ( ) ( ) d t
dt
u t i t c c L . (3.6)

rate of change of inductor current as

The output of this system is represented by the linear algebraic equation
υo ( )t R = i t L ( ).
We can rewrite Equations (3.6) and (3.7) as a set of two first-order differential 
equations in terms of the state variables x t 1 ( ) and x t 2 ( ) as

M03_DORF2374_14_GE_C03.indd 187 14/09/21 9:54 AM188 Chapter 3 State Variable Models
The state variables that describe a system are not a unique set, and several 
alternative sets of state variables can be chosen. For example, for a second-order 
system, such as the spring-mass-damper or RLC circuit, the state variables may be 
any two independent linear combinations of x t 1 ( ) and x t 2 ( ). For the RLC circuit, we 
might choose the set of state variables as the two voltages, υ ( )t c and υL ( )t , where 
υL ( )t is the voltage drop across the inductor. Then the new state variables, x t 1 ( ) *
and x t 2 ( ), * are related to the old state variables, x t 1 ( ) and x t 2 ( ), as
x t t x t 1 ( ) = = υc ( ) ( ), * 1 (3.11)
and
x t 2 ( ) = = υ υ L c ( )t t( ) − = RiL ( )t x ( )t R − x t( ). * 1 2 (3.12)
Equation (3.12) represents the relation between the inductor voltage and the for￾mer state variables υ ( )t c and i t L ( ). In a typical system, there are several choices 
of a set of state variables that specify the energy stored in a system and therefore 
adequately describe the dynamics of the system. It is usual to choose a set of state 
variables that can be readily measured.
An alternative approach to developing a model of a device is the use of the 
bond graph. Bond graphs can be used for electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, and 
thermal devices or systems as well as for combinations of various types of elements. 
Bond graphs produce a set of equations in the state variable form [7].
The state variables of a system characterize the dynamic behavior of a sys￾tem. The engineer’s interest is primarily in physical systems, where the variables 
typically are voltages, currents, velocities, positions, pressures, temperatures, and 
similar physical variables. However, the concept of system state is also useful in 
analyzing biological, social, and economic systems. For these systems, the concept 
of state is extended beyond the concept of the current configuration of a physical 
system to the broader viewpoint of variables that will be capable of describing the 
future behavior of the system.

The response of a system is described by the set of first-order differential equa￾tions written in terms of the state variables ( ) x t 1 2 ( ),  x t( ),  . . . , x t n ( ) and the inputs 
( ) u t 1 2 ( ),  u t( ),  . . . ,   . u t m ( ) A set of linear first-order differential equations can be

Then the system can be represented by the compact notation of the state differen￾tial equation as
x A ( )t t = + x B ( ) u( )t . (3.16)
Equation (3.16) is also commonly called the state equation.
The matrix A is an n n × square matrix, and B is an n m× matrix.†
 The state 
differential equation relates the rate of change of the state of the system to the state 
of the system and the input signals. In general, the outputs of a linear system can be 
related to the state variables and the input signals by the output equation
y C ( )t t = + x D ( ) u( )t , (3.17)
where y t( ) is the set of output signals expressed in column vector form. The state￾space representation (or state-variable representation) comprises the state differen￾tial equation and the output equation.

The solution of the state differential equation can be obtained in a manner 
similar to the method for solving a first-order differential equation. Consider the 
first-order differential equation
x t ( ) = + ax( )t bu t( ), (3.20)
where x(t) and u(t) are scalar functions of time. We expect an exponential solution 
of the form e . at Taking the Laplace transform of Equation (3.20), we have

We note that to determine the state transition matrix, all initial conditions are set 
to 0 except for one state variable, and the output of each state variable is evaluated. 
That is, the term φ ( )t ij is the response of the ith state variable due to an initial 
condition on the jth state variable when there are zero initial conditions on all the 
other variables. We shall use this relationship between the initial conditions and the 
state variables to evaluate the coefficients of the transition matrix in a later section. 
However, first we shall develop several suitable signal-flow state models of systems 
and investigate the stability of the systems by utilizing these flow graphs.
EXAMPLE 3.1 Two rolling carts
Consider the system shown in Figure 3.4. The variables of interest are noted on 
the figure and defined as: M M1 2 ,   = mass of carts, p t( ),  q t( ) = position of 
carts, u t( ) = external force acting on system, k k 1 2 ,   = spring constants, and

b b 1 2 ,   = damping coefficients. The free-body diagram of mass M1 is shown in 
Figure 3.5(b), where p t   ( ),  q t( ) = velocity of M1 and M2, respectively. We assume 
that the carts have negligible rolling friction. We consider any existing rolling fric￾tion to be lumped into the damping coefficients, b1 and b2.
Now, given the free-body diagram with forces and directions appropriately ap￾plied, we use Newton’s second law (sum of the forces equals mass of the object 
multiplied by its acceleration) to obtain the equations of motion—one equation for 
each mass. For mass M1 we have
M p1 1 ( )t b + + p t   ( ) k p1 1 ( )t u = + ( )t k q t( ) + b q1 ( )t , (3.28)
where
p t ( ),  q t ( ) = acceleration of M M 1 2  and  ,  respectively.
Similarly, for mass M2 in Figure 3.5(a), we have
M q2 1 ( )t k + + ( ) k q 2 1 ( )t b + + ( ) b q 2 1   ( )t k = + p t( ) b p1 ( )t . (3.29)
We now have a model given by the two second-order ordinary differential equa￾tions in Equations (3.28) and (3.29). We can start developing a state-space model 
by defining
x t 1 ( ) = p t( ),
x t 2 ( ) = q t( ).
We could have alternatively defined x t 1 ( ) = q t( ) and x t 2 ( ) = p t( ). The state-space 
model is not unique. Denoting the derivatives of x t 1 ( ) and x t 2 ( ) as x t 3 ( ) and x t 4 ( ),
respectively, it follows that
x t 3 1 ( ) = = x t   ( ) p t( ), (3.30)
x t 4 2 ( ) = = x t   ( ) q t( ). (3.31)
Taking the derivative of x3(t) and x4(t) yields, respectively,

3.4 SIGNAL-FLOW GRAPH AND BLOCK DIAGRAM MODELS
The state of a system describes the dynamic behavior where the dynamics of the 
system are represented by a set of first-order differential equations. Alternatively, 
the dynamics of the system can be represented by a state differential equation as in 
Equation (3.16). In either case, it is useful to develop a graphical model of the sys￾tem and use this model to relate the state variable concept to the familiar transfer 
function representation. The graphical model can be represented via signal-flow 
graphs or block diagrams.
As we have learned in previous chapters, a system can be meaningfully de￾scribed by an input–output relationship, the transfer function G s( ). For example, if 
we are interested in the relation between the output voltage and the input voltage 
of the network of Figure 3.3, we can obtain the transfer function
. 0 ( ) ( )

where α β,   , and γ are functions of the circuit parameters R, L, and C, respectively. 
The values of α β,   , and γ can be determined from the differential equations that 
describe the circuit. For the RLC circuit (see Equations 3.8 and 3.9), we have

Many electric circuits, electromechanical systems, and other control systems are not 
as simple as the RLC circuit of Figure 3.3, and it is often a difficult task to determine 
a set of first-order differential equations describing the system. Therefore, it is often 
simpler to derive the transfer function of the system and then derive the state model 
from the transfer function.
The signal-flow graph state model and the block diagram model can be readily 
derived from the transfer function of a system. However, as we noted in Section 3.3,

there is more than one alternative set of state variables, and therefore there is 
more than one possible form for the signal-flow graph and block diagram mod￾els. There are several key canonical forms of the state-variable representation, such 
as the  phase variable canonical form, that we will investigate in this chapter. In 
general, we can represent a transfer function as

Our familiarity with Mason’s signal-flow gain formula allows us to recognize the 
familiar feedback factors in the denominator and the forward-path factors in the nu￾merator. Mason’s signal-flow gain formula was discussed in Section 2.7 and is written as

There are several flow graphs that could represent the transfer function. Two flow 
graph configurations based on Mason’s signal-flow gain formula are of particular 
interest, and we will consider these in greater detail. In the next section, we will 
consider two additional configurations: the physical state variable model and the 
diagonal (or Jordan canonical) form model.
To illustrate the derivation of the signal-flow graph state model, let us initially 
consider the fourth-order transfer function

First we note that the system is fourth order, and hence we identify four state vari￾ables ( ) x t 1 2 ( ,   ( x t),   ( x t 3 4 ),   ( x t)). Recalling Mason’s signal-flow gain formula, we note 
that the denominator can be considered to be 1 minus the sum of the loop gains. 
Furthermore, the numerator of the transfer function is equal to the forward-path fac￾tor of the flow graph. The flow graph must include a minimum number of integrators 
equal to the order of the system. Therefore, we use four integrators to represent this sys￾tem. The necessary flow graph nodes and the four integrators are shown in Figure 3.8.

Considering the simplest series interconnection of integrators, we can represent the 
transfer function by the flow graph of Figure 3.9. Examining this figure, we note that 
all the loops are touching and that the transfer function of this flow graph is indeed 
Equation (3.45). The reader can readily verify this by noting that the forward-path 
factor of the flow graph is b s 0/ 4 and the denominator is equal to 1 minus the sum of 
the loop gains.
We can also consider the block diagram model of Equation (3.45). Rearranging 
the terms in Equation (3.45) and taking the inverse Laplace transform yields the 
differential equation model

Then it follows that the fourth-order differential equation can be written equivalently 
as four first-order differential equations, namely,
x t 1 2 ( ) = x t( ),
x t 2 3 ( ) = x t( ),
x t 3 4 ( ) = x t( ),
and
x t 4 0 ( ) = −a x1 1 ( )t a − − x t 2 2 ( ) a x3 3 ( )t a − + x t 4 ( ) u t( );
and the corresponding output equation is
y t( ) = b x0 1 ( )t .
The block diagram model can be readily obtained from the four first-order differen￾tial equations as illustrated in Figure 3.9(b).
Now consider the fourth-order transfer function when the numerator is a poly￾nomial in s, so that we have

The numerator terms represent forward-path factors in Mason’s signal-flow gain 
formula. The forward paths will touch all the loops, and a suitable signal-flow graph 
realization of Equation (3.46) is shown in Figure 3.10(a). The forward-path factors 
are b s 3 2 / / , , b s b s/ , 2 1 3 and b s 0/ 4 as required to provide the numerator of the transfer 
function. Recall that Mason’s signal-flow gain formula indicates that the numerator 
of the transfer function is simply the sum of the forward-path factors. This general 
form of a signal-flow graph can represent the general transfer function of Equation 
(3.46) by utilizing n feedback loops involving the an coefficients and m forward-path 
factors involving the bm coefficients. The general form of the flow graph state model 
and the block diagram model shown in Figure 3.10 is called the phase variable 
canonical form.
The state variables are identified in Figure 3.10 as the output of each energy 
storage element, that is, the output of each integrator. To obtain the set of 
first-order differential equations representing the state model of Equation (3.46), 
we will introduce a new set of flow graph nodes immediately preceding each in￾tegrator of Figure 3.10(a) [5, 6]. The nodes are placed before each integrator, and 
therefore they represent the derivative of the output of each integrator. The sig￾nal-flow graph, including the added nodes, is shown in Figure 3.11. Using the flow 
graph of this figure, we are able to obtain the following set of first-order differential 
equations describing the state of the model:
1 2 ,,, 2 3 3 4 x t   ( ) = = x t( ) x t( ) x t( ) x t  ( ) = x t( )
x t 4 0 ( ) = −a x1 1 ( )t a − − x t 2 2 ( ) a x3 3 ( )t a − + x t 4 ( ) u t( ). (3.47)
In this equation, x t 1 2 ( ),  x t( ),…x t n ( ) are the n phase variables.

x t 4 3 ( ) = = x t  ( ) z t ( ).
Then the differential equation can be written equivalently as

x t 2 3 ( ) = x t( ),
x t 3 4 ( ) = x t( ),
and
x t 4 0 ( ) = −a x1 1 ( )t a − − x t 2 2 ( ) a x3 3 ( )t a − + x t 4 ( ) u t( ),

The graphical structures of Figure 3.10 are not unique representations of 
Equation (3.46); another equally useful structure can be obtained. A flow graph 
that represents Equation (3.46) equally well is shown in Figure 3.12(a). In this case, 
the forward-path factors are obtained by feeding forward the signal U(s). We will 
call this model the input feedforward canonical form.
Then the output signal y t( ) is equal to the first state variable x t 1 ( ). This flow 
graph structure has the forward-path factors b s 0/ ,  b s/// ,  b s ,  b s, 4 1 3 2 2 3 and all the for￾ward paths touch the feedback loops. Therefore, the resulting transfer function is 
indeed equal to Equation (3.46).
Associated with the input feedforward format, we have the set of first-order 
differential equations
x t   1 3 ( ) = −a x1 2 ( )t x + + ( )t b3 2 u t( ),  x t( ) = −a x2 1 ( )t x + + 3 2 ( )t b u t( ),
x t   3 1 ( ) = −a x1 4 ( )t x + + ( )t b1 4 u t( ), and x t( ) = −a x0 1 ( )t b + 0u t( ). (3.52)

Although the input feedforward canonical form of Figure 3.12 represents the same 
transfer function as the phase variable canonical form of Figure 3.10, the state 
variables of each graph are not equal. Furthermore we recognize that the initial con￾ditions of the system can be represented by the initial conditions of the integrators,

We note that it was not necessary to factor the numerator or denominator poly￾nomial to obtain the state differential equations for the phase variable model or the 
input feedforward model. Avoiding the factoring of polynomials permits us to avoid 
the tedious effort involved. Both models require three integrators because the sys￾tem is third order. However, it is important to emphasize that the state variables 
of the state model of Figure 3.13 are not identical to the state variables of the state 
model of Figure 3.14. Of course, one set of state variables is related to the other set 
of state variables by an appropriate linear transformation of variables. A linear ma￾trix transformation is represented by z M = x, which transforms the x-vector into 
the z-vector by means of the M matrix. Finally, we note that the transfer function of 
Equation (3.41) represents a single-output linear constant coefficient system; thus, 
the transfer function can represent an nth-order differential equation

3.5 ALTERNATIVE SIGNAL-FLOW GRAPH AND BLOCK DIAGRAM MODELS
Often the control system designer studies an actual control system block diagram 
that represents physical devices and variables. An example of a model of a DC 
motor with shaft velocity as the output is shown in Figure 3.15 [9]. We wish to 
select the physical variables as the state variables. Thus, we select: x t 1 ( ) = y t( ),
the velocity output; x t 2 ( ) = i t( ), the field current; and the third state variable, 
x t 3 ( ), is selected to be x t 3 ( ) = −     r t( ) u t( ), 1

20 where u(t) is the field voltage. We 
may draw the models for these physical variables, as shown in Figure 3.16. Note 
that the state variables x t 1 2 ( ),  x t( ), and x t 3 ( )are identified on the models. We will 
denote this format as the physical state variable model. This model is particularly 
useful when we can measure the physical state variables. Note that the model of 
each block is separately determined. For example, note that the transfer function 
for the controller is

This choice of state variables is arbitrary; for example, x t 1 ( ) could be chosen as 
associated with the factor s + 2.
The decoupled form of the state differential matrix equation displays the 
distinct model poles − − s s 1 2 ,   , . ..,   , − sn and this format is often called the 
diagonal  canonical form. A system can always be written in diagonal form if it 
possesses distinct poles; otherwise, it can only be written in a block diagonal form, 
known as the Jordan canonical form [24].

EXAMPLE 3.3 Inverted pendulum control
The problem of balancing a broomstick on a person’s hand is illustrated in Figure 3.18. 
The only equilibrium condition is θ( )t = 0 and d t θ( )/ = dt 0. The problem of balanc￾ing a broomstick on one’s hand is not unlike the problem of controlling the attitude 
of a missile during the initial stages of launch. This problem is the classic and intrigu￾ing problem of the inverted pendulum mounted on a cart, as shown in Figure 3.19. 
The cart must be moved so that mass m is always in an upright position. The state 
variables must be expressed in terms of the angular rotation θ( )t and the position of 
the cart y t( ). The differential equations describing the motion of the system can be 
obtained by writing the sum of the forces in the horizontal direction and the sum of 
the moments about the pivot point [2, 3, 10, 23]. We will assume that M m  and 
the angle of rotation θ( )t , is small so that the equations are linear. The sum of the 
forces in the horizontal direction is
 0,  My( )t m + − l t θ( ) u t( ) = (3.63)
where u(s) equals the force on the cart, and l is the distance from the mass m to the 
pivot point. The sum of the torques about the pivot point is
0. 2   mly t( ) + − ml θ θ ( )t mlg ( )t = (3.64)

are written in terms of the state variables as
Mx  2 4 ( )t m + − lx ( )t u( )t = 0 (3.65)
and
x t   2 4 ( ) + − lx ( )t gx t 3 ( ) = 0. (3.66)

3.6 THE TRANSFER FUNCTION FROM THE STATE EQUATION
Given a transfer function G s( ), we can obtain the state variable equations using 
the signal-flow graph model. Now we turn to the matter of determining the transfer 
function G s( ) of a single-input, single-output (SISO) system. Recalling Equations 
(3.16) and (3.17), we have
x A ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( ) (3.71)
and
y t( ) = + Cx( )t u D ( )t (3.72)
where y t( ) is the single output and u(s) is the single input. The Laplace transforms 
of Equations (3.71) and (3.72) are
s s X A ( ) = + X B ( )s U( )s (3.73)
and
Y s( ) = + CX( )s UD ( )s (3.74)
where B is an n×1 matrix, since U s( ) is a single input. Note that we do not include 
initial conditions, since we seek the transfer function. Rearranging Equation (3.73), 
we obtain
( ) s s I A − = X B ( ) U s( ). (3.75)
Since [ ] , 1 s s I A − = Φ( ) − we have
X B ( )s s = Φ( ) U s( ). (3.76)
Substituting X (s) into Equation (3.74), we obtain
Y s( ) = + [ ] C B Φ( )s U D ( )s . (3.77)
Therefore, the transfer function G s( ) = / Y s( ) U s( ) is
G s( ) = + C B Φ( )s D (3.78)
EXAMPLE 3.4 Transfer function of an RLC circuit
Let us determine the transfer function G s( ) = / Y s( ) U s( ) for the RLC circuit of

3.7 THE TIME RESPONSE AND THE STATE TRANSITION MATRIX
It is often desirable to obtain the time response of the state variables of a control 
system and thus examine the performance of the system. The transient response 
of a system can be readily obtained by evaluating the solution to the state vector 
differential equation. In Section 3.3, we found that the solution for the state differ￾ential Equation (3.26) was
∫ ( )t t = + Φ Φ ( ) ( ) ( ) t d − τ τ( ) τ
t
x x 0   Bu .
0
(3.80)
If the initial conditions x(0), the input u( ) τ , and the state transition matrix Φ( )t
are known, the time response of x(t) can be obtained. Thus the problem focuses 
M03_DORF2374_14_GE_C03.indd 210 14/09/21 9:55 AMSection 3.7 The Time Response and the State Transition Matrix 211
on the evaluation of Φ( )t , the state transition matrix that represents the response 
of the system. Fortunately, the state transition matrix can be readily evaluated by 
using the signal-flow graph techniques.
Before proceeding to the evaluation of the state transition matrix using 
signal-flow graphs, we should note that several other methods exist for evaluating 
the transition matrix, such as the evaluation of the exponential series
Φ( ) = = ∑=
∞
t t

exp( ) ! 0
(3.81)
in a truncated form [2, 8]. Several efficient methods exist for the evaluation of Φ( )t
by means of a computer algorithm [21].
In Equation (3.25), we found that Φ( ) = − − s s[ ] I A . 1 Therefore, if Φ( )s
is obtained by completing the matrix inversion, we can obtain Φ( )t by noting 
that l . Φ Φ 1 ( ) = { } ( ) − t s The matrix inversion process is generally unwieldy for 
higher-order systems.
The usefulness of the signal-flow graph state model for obtaining the state 
transition matrix becomes clear upon consideration of the Laplace transformation 
version of Equation (3.80) when the input is zero. Taking the Laplace transforma￾tion of Equation (3.80) when u( ) τ = 0, we have
X x ( )s s = Φ( ) ( ) 0 . (3.82)
Therefore, we can evaluate the Laplace transform of the transition matrix from the 
signal-flow graph by determining the relation between a state variable X s i( ) and 
the state initial conditions [ 0 x x 1 2 ( ),   ( ) 0 ,…,  xn ( ) 0 ]. Then the state transition matrix 
is the inverse transform of Φ( )s ; that is,
l . Φ Φ 1 ( ) = { } ( ) − t s (3.83)
The relationship between a state variable X s i( ) and the initial conditions x(0) 
is obtained by using Mason’s signal-flow gain formula. Thus, for a second-order 
system, we would have
X s 1 1 ( ) = + φ φ 1 1 ( )s x ( ) 0 0 12 ( )s x2 ( ),
X s 2 2 ( ) = + φ φ 1 1 ( )s x ( ) 0 0 22 ( )s x2 ( ), (3.84)
and the relation between X s 2 ( ) as an output and x1 ( ) 0 as an input can be evaluated 
by Mason’s signal-flow gain formula. All the elements of the state transition matrix, 
φ ( )s , ij can be obtained by evaluating the individual relationships between X s i( )
and xj( ) 0 from the state model flow graph. An example will illustrate this approach 
to determining the transition matrix.
EXAMPLE 3.5 Evaluation of the state transition matrix
We will consider the RLC network of Figure 3.3. We seek to evaluate Φ( )s by (1) 
determining the matrix inversion Φ( ) = − − s s[ ] I A 1, and (2) using the signal-flow 
diagram and Mason’s signal-flow gain formula.

The signal-flow graph state model of the RLC network of Figure 3.3, is 
shown in Figure 3.7. This RLC network can be represented by the state variables 
x t 1 ( ) = υ ( )t c and x t 2 ( ) = i t L ( ). The initial conditions, x1 ( ) 0 and x2 ( ) 0 , represent 
the initial capacitor voltage and inductor current, respectively. The flow graph, in￾cluding the initial conditions of each state variable, is shown in Figure 3.20. The 
initial conditions appear as the initial value of the state variable at the output of 
each integrator.
To obtain Φ( )s , we set U s( ) = 0. When R L = = 3,   1, and C = 1/2, we ob￾tain the signal-flow graph shown in Figure 3.21, where the output and input nodes 
are deleted because they are not involved in the evaluation of Φ( )s . Then, using

The response of the system for these initial conditions is shown in Figure 3.22. 
The trajectory of the state vector ( ) x t 1 2 ( ),  x t( ) on the ( ) x x 1 2 ,   -plane is shown in 
Figure 3.23.
The evaluation of the time response is facilitated by the determination of the 
state transition matrix. Although this approach is limited to linear systems, it is a 
powerful method and utilizes the familiar signal-flow graph to evaluate the transi￾tion matrix. ■
3.8 DESIGN EXAMPLES
In this section we present two illustrative design examples. In the first example, we 
present a detailed look at modeling a large space vehicle (such as a space station) 
using a state variable model. The state variable model is then used to take a look 
at the stability of the orientation of the spacecraft in a low Earth orbit. The design 
process is highlighted in this example. The second example is a printer belt drive 
design. The relationship between the state variable model and the block diagram is 
illustrated and, using block diagram reduction methods, the transfer function equiv￾alent of the state variable model is obtained.
EXAMPLE 3.6 Modeling the orientation of a space station
The International Space Station, shown in Figure 3.24, is a good example of a multi￾purpose spacecraft that can operate in many different configurations. An important 
step in the control system design process is to develop a mathematical model of 
the spacecraft motion. In general, this model describes the translation and attitude 
motion of the spacecraft under the influence of external forces and torques, and 
controller and actuator forces and torques. The resulting spacecraft dynamic model

is a set of highly coupled, nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Our objec￾tive is to simplify the model while retaining important system characteristics. This 
is not a trivial task, but an important, and often neglected component of control 
engineering. In this example, the rotational motion is considered. The translational 
motion, while critically important to orbit maintenance, can be decoupled from the 
rotational motion.
Many spacecraft (such as the International Space Station) will maintain an 
Earth-pointing attitude. This means that cameras and other scientific instruments 
pointing down will be able to sense the Earth. Conversely, scientific instruments 
pointing up will see deep space, as desired. To achieve Earth-pointing attitude, the 
spacecraft needs an attitude hold control system capable of applying the necessary 
torques. The torques are the inputs to the system, in this case, the space station. The 
attitude is the output of the system. The International Space Station employs con￾trol moment gyros and reaction control jets as actuators to control the attitude. The 
control moment gyros are momentum exchangers and are preferable to reaction 
control jets because they do not expend fuel. They are actuators that consist of a 
constant-rate flywheel mounted on a set of gimbals. The flywheel orientation is var￾ied by rotating the gimbals, resulting in a change in direction of the flywheel angular 
momentum. In accord with the basic principle of conservation of angular momen￾tum, changes in control moment gyro momentum must be transferred to the space

station, thereby producing a reaction torque. The reaction torque can be employed 
to control the space station attitude. However, there is a maximum limit of control 
that can be provided by the control moment gyro. When that maximum is attained, 
the device is said to have reached saturation. So, while control moment gyros do not 
expend fuel, they can provide only a limited amount of control. In practice, it is pos￾sible to control the attitude of the space station while simultaneously desaturating 
the control moment gyros.
Several methods for desaturating the control moment gyros are available, but 
using existing natural environmental torques is the preferred method because it 
minimizes the use of the reaction control jets. A clever idea is to use gravity gra￾dient torques (which occur naturally) to continuously desaturate the momentum 
exchange devices. Due to the variation of the Earth’s gravitational field over the 
International Space Station, the total moment generated by the gravitational forces 
about the spacecraft’s center of mass is nonzero. This nonzero moment is called the 
gravity gradient torque. A change in attitude changes the gravity gradient torque 
acting on the vehicle. Thus, combining attitude control and momentum manage￾ment becomes a matter of compromise.
The elements of the design process emphasized in this example are illustrated 
in Figure 3.25. We can begin the modeling process by defining the attitude of the

space station using the three angles, θ2 ( )t (the pitch angle), θ3 ( )t (the yaw angle), 
and θ1 ( )t (the roll angle). These three angles represent the attitude of the space sta￾tion relative to the desired Earth-pointing attitude. When θ θ 1 2 ( )t t = = ( ) θ3 ( )t = 0,
the space station is oriented in the desired direction. The goal is to keep the space 
station oriented in the desired attitude while minimizing the amount of momentum 
exchange required by the control momentum gyros (keeping in mind that we want 
to avoid saturation). The control goal can be stated as
Control Goal
Minimize the roll, yaw, and pitch angles in the presence of persistent exter￾nal disturbances while simultaneously minimizing the control moment gyro 
momentum.
The time rate of change of the angular momentum of a body about its center of 
mass is equal to the sum of the external torques acting on that body. Thus the at￾titude dynamics of a spacecraft are driven by externally acting torques. The main 
external torque acting on the space station is due to gravity. Since we treat the 
Earth as a point mass, the gravity gradient torque [30] acting on the spacecraft is 
given by
T c g ( )t n = × 3 , ( )t t Ic( ) 2 (3.95)
where n is the orbital angular velocity ( n r = / 0.0011 ad s for the space station), and

The notation ‘×’ denotes vector cross-product. Matrix I is the spacecraft iner￾tia matrix and is a function of the space station configuration. It also follows 
from Equation (3.95) that the gravity gradient torques are a function of the atti￾tude θ θ 1 2 ( )t t ,   ( ), and θ3 ( )t . We want to maintain a prescribed attitude (that is 
Earth-pointing θ θ 1 2 = = θ3 = 0 ), but sometimes we must deviate from that atti￾tude so that we can generate gravity gradient torques to assist in the control moment 
gyro momentum management. Therein lies the conflict; as engineers we often are 
required to develop control systems to manage conflicting goals.
Now we examine the effect of the aerodynamic torque acting on the space 
station. Even at the high altitude of the space station, the aerodynamic torque does 
affect the attitude motion. The aerodynamic torque acting on the space station is 
generated by the atmospheric drag force that acts through the center of pressure. In 
general, the center of pressure and the center of mass do not coincide, so aerody￾namic torques develop. In low Earth orbit, the aerodynamic torque is a sinusoidal 
function that tends to oscillate around a small bias. The oscillation in the torque 
is primarily a result of the Earth’s diurnal atmospheric bulge. Due to heating, the 
atmosphere closest to the Sun extends further into space than the atmosphere on 
the side of the Earth away from the Sun. As the space station travels around the 
Earth (once every 90 minutes or so), it moves through varying air densities, thus 
M03_DORF2374_14_GE_C03.indd 217 14/09/21 9:56 AM218 Chapter 3 State Variable Models
causing a cyclic aerodynamic torque. Also, the space station solar panels rotate as 
they track the Sun. This results in another cyclic component of aerodynamic torque. 
The aerodynamic torque is generally much smaller than the gravity gradient torque. 
Therefore, for design purposes we can ignore the atmospheric drag torque and view 
it as a disturbance torque. We would like the controller to minimize the effects of 
the aerodynamic disturbance on the spacecraft attitude.
Torques caused by the gravitation of other planetary bodies, magnetic fields, 
solar radiation and wind, and other less significant phenomena are much smaller 
than the Earth’s gravity-induced torque and aerodynamic torque. We ignore these 
torques in the dynamic model and view them as disturbances.
Finally, we need to discuss the control moment gyros themselves. First, we will 
lump all the control moment gyros together and view them as a single source of 
torque. We represent the total control moment gyro momentum with the variable h(t). 
We need to know and understand the dynamics in the design phase to manage the 
angular momentum. But since the time constants associated with these dynamics 
are much shorter than for attitude dynamics, we can ignore the dynamics and as￾sume that the control moment gyros can produce precisely and without a time delay 
the torque demanded by the control system.
Based on the above discussion, a simplified nonlinear model that we can use as 
the basis for the control design is

where u(t) is the control moment gyro input torque, Ω (t) in the angular velocity, I
is the moment of inertia matrix, and n is the orbital angular velocity. Two good 
references that describe the fundamentals of spacecraft dynamic modeling are [26] 
and [27]. There have been many papers dealing with space station control and mo￾mentum management. One of the first to present the nonlinear model in Equations 
(3.96–3.98) is Wie et al. [28]. Other related information about the model and the 
control problem in general appears in [29–33]. Articles related to advanced control 
topics on the space station can be found in [34–40]. Researchers are developing 
nonlinear control laws based on the nonlinear model in Equations (3.96)–(3.98). 
Several good articles on this topic appear in [41–50].
M03_DORF2374_14_GE_C03.indd 218 14/09/21 9:56 AMSection 3.8 Design Examples 219
Equation (3.96) represents the kinematics—the relationship between the Euler 
angles, denoted by Θ( )t , and the angular velocity vector, Ω( )t . Equation (3.97) 
represents the space station attitude dynamics. The terms on the right side repre￾sent the sum of the external torques acting on the spacecraft. The first torque is due 
to inertia cross-coupling. The second term represents the gravity gradient torque, 
and the last term is the torque applied to the spacecraft from the actuators. The 
disturbance torques (due to such factors as the atmosphere) are not included in the 
model used in the design. Equation (3.98) represents the control moment gyro total 
momentum.
The conventional approach to spacecraft momentum management design 
is to develop a linear model, representing the spacecraft attitude and control 
moment gyro momentum by linearizing the nonlinear model. This linearization 
is accomplished by a standard Taylor series approximation. Linear control design 
methods can then be readily applied. For linearization purposes we assume that 
the spacecraft has zero products of inertia (that is, the inertia matrix is diagonal) 
and the aerodynamic disturbances are negligible. The equilibrium state that we 
linearize about is

Ω = −

In reality, the inertia matrix, I, is not a diagonal matrix. Neglecting the off-diagonal 
terms is consistent with the linearization approximations and is a common 
assumption. Applying the Taylor series approximations yields the linear model, 
which as it turns out decouples the pitch axis from the roll/yaw axis.

We can see that if ∆ >2 0, then some elements of the state transition matrix will 
have terms of the form eat, where a > 0. This indicates that our system is unstable. 
Also, if we are interested in the output, y t( ) = θ2 ( )t , we have
y t( ) = Cx( )t .
With x(t) given by

If ∆ >2 0 (that is, if I I 3 1 > ), then we have two real poles—one in the left half￾plane and the other in the right half-plane. For spacecraft with I I 3 1 > , we can say 
that an Earth-pointing attitude is an unstable orientation. This means that active 
control is necessary.
Conversely, when ∆ <2 0 (that is, when I I 1 3 > ), the characteristic equation 
has two imaginary roots at
3 . 2 s j = ± n ∆2
This type of spacecraft is marginally stable. In the absence of any control moment 
gyro torques, the spacecraft will oscillate around the Earth-pointing orientation for 
any small initial deviation from the desired attitude. ■

EXAMPLE 3.7 Printer belt drive modeling
A commonly used low-cost printer for a computer uses a belt drive to move the 
printing device laterally across the printed page [11]. The printing device may be a 
laser printer, a print ball, or thermal printhead. An example of a belt drive printer 
with a DC motor actuator is shown in Figure 3.26. In this model, a light sensor is 
used to measure the position of the printing device, and the belt tension adjusts 
the spring flexibility of the belt. The goal of the design is to determine the effect 
of the belt spring constant k and select appropriate parameters for the motor, the 
belt pulley, and the controller. To achieve the analysis, we will determine a model 
of the belt-drive system and select many of its parameters. Using this model, we 
will obtain the signal-flow graph model and select the state variables. We then 
will determine an appropriate transfer function for the system and select its other 
parameters, except for the spring constant. Finally, we will examine the effect of 
varying the spring constant within a realistic range.
We propose the model of the belt-drive system shown in Figure 3.27. This 
model assumes that the spring constant of the belt is k, the radius of the pulley is r, 
the angular rotation of the motor shaft is θ( )t , and the angular rotation of the right￾hand pulley is θp ( )t . The mass of the printing device is m, and its position is y t( ). A 
light sensor is used to measure y t( ), and the output of the sensor is a voltage υ1 ( )t ,

where υ1 1 ( )t k = y t( ). The controller provides an output voltage υ2 ( )t , where υ2 ( )t
is a function of υ1 ( )t . The voltage υ2 ( )t is connected to the field of the motor. Let us 
assume that we can use the linear relationship

and elect to use k2 = 0.1 and k3 = 0 (velocity feedback).
The inertia of the motor and pulley is J J = + motor Jpulley. We plan to 
use a moderate-DC motor. Selecting a typical 1/8-hp DC motor, we find that 
0.01 kg m , = 2 J the field inductance is negligible, the field resistance is R = Ω2  ,
the motor constant is Km = / 2 Nm A, and the motor and pulley friction is 
b = / 0.25 Nms rad. The radius of the pulley is r = 0.15 m, m = 0.2 kg, and 
k1 = / 1 V m.
We now proceed to write the equations of the motion for the system; note that 
y t( ) = r t θp ( ). Then the tension from equilibrium T1 is
T t 1 ( ) = − k r( ) θ θ ( )t r p ( )t k ) ( = − r t θ( ) y t( ) .
The tension from equilibrium T t 2 ( ) is
T t 2 ( ) = − k y( ) ( )t rθ( )t .

when we select the third state variable as x t 3 ( ) = / d t θ( ) dt. We now require a dif￾ferential equation describing the motor rotation. When L = 0, we have the field

undesired load torque, so that
T t m d ( ) = + T t( ) T t( ).
The torque T(t) drives the shaft to the pulley, so that

The signal-flow graph and block diagram models representing the matrix differen￾tial equation are shown in Figure 3.28, where we include the identification of the 
node for the disturbance torque T t d ( ).
We can use the flow graph to determine the transfer function X s 1 ( )/T s d ( ). The 
goal is to reduce the effect of the disturbance T s d ( ), and the transfer function will 
show us how to accomplish this goal. Using Mason’s signal-flow gain formula, we

in the end. The original block diagram is shown in Figure 3.28(b). The result of 
the first step is shown in Figure 3.29(a), where the upper feedback loop has been 
reduced to a single transfer function. The second step illustrated in Figure 3.29(b) 
then reduces the two lower feedback loops to a single transfer function. In the third 
step shown in Figure 3.29(c), the lower feedback loop is closed and then the re￾maining transfer functions in series in the lower loop are combined. The final step 
closed-loop transfer function is shown in Figure 3.29(d).

We wish to select the spring constant k so that the state variable x t 1 ( ) will quickly 
decline to a low value when a disturbance occurs. For test purposes, consider a 
step disturbance T s d ( ) = /a s. Recalling that x t 1 ( ) = − r t θ( ) y t( ), we thus seek 
a small magnitude for x1 so that y is nearly equal to the desired rθ. If we have a 
perfectly stiff belt with k → ∞, then y t( ) = r t θ( ) exactly. With a step disturbance, 
T s d ( ) = a s/ , we have

and thus the steady-state value of x t 1 ( ) is zero. We need to use a realistic value for k
in the range 1 ≤ ≤k 40. For an average value of k = 20, we have

3.9 ANALYSIS OF STATE VARIABLE MODELS USING CONTROL DESIGN SOFTWARE
The time-domain method utilizes a state-space representation of the system model, 
given by
x A ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( ) and . y t( ) = + Cx( )t u D ( )t (3.114)
The vector x(t) is the state of the system, A is the constant n n × system matrix, B
is the constant n m× input matrix, C is the constant p n × output matrix, and D is a 
constant p m× matrix. The number of inputs, m, and the number of outputs, p, are 
taken to be one, since we are considering only single-input, single-output (SISO) 
problems. Therefore y t( ) and u(t) are not bold (matrix) variables.
The main elements of the state-space representation in Equation (3.114) are 
the state vector x(t) and the constant matrices (A, B, C, D). Two new functions cov￾ered in this section are ss and Isim. We also consider the use of the expm function 
to calculate the state transition matrix.
Given a transfer function, we can obtain an equivalent state-space representation 
and vice versa. The function tf can be used to convert a state-space representation 
to a transfer function representation; the function ss can be used to convert a trans￾fer function representation to a state-space representation. These functions are 
shown in Figure 3.31, where sys_tf represents a transfer function model and sys_ss
is a state-space representation.

It is possible that when using the ss function, the state variable representation 
provided by your control design software will be different from the above two 
examples depending on the specific software and version.

The matrix exponential function in Equation (3.116) is the state transition matrix, 
Φ( )t , where
Φ( )t t = exp( ) A .
We can use the function expm to compute the transition matrix for a given time, as 
illustrated in Figure 3.34. The expm(A) function computes the matrix exponential. 
In contrast, the exp(A) function calculates eaij for each of the elements a . ij ∈ A

The initial conditions are x x 1 2 ( ) 0 0 = = ( ) 1 and the input u t( ) = 0. At t = 0.2, the 
state transition matrix is as given in Figure 3.34. The state at t = 0.2 is predicted by 
the state transition methods to be

The time response of the system of Equation (3.115) can also be obtained by using 
the Isim function. The Isim function can accept as input nonzero initial conditions as 
well as an input function, as shown in Figure 3.35. Using the Isim function, we can 
calculate the response for the RLC network as shown in Figure 3.36.
The state at t = 0.2 is predicted with the Isim function to be x1 (0.2) =
x2 ( ) 0.2 = 0.6703. If we can compare the results obtained by the Isim function and 
by multiplying the initial condition state vector by the state transition matrix, we 
find identical results.

3.10 SEQUENTIAL DESIGN EXAMPLE: DISK DRIVE READ SYSTEM
Advanced disks have as many as 8000 tracks per cm. These tracks are typically 
1 µm wide. Thus, there are stringent requirements on the accuracy of the reader 
head position and of the movement from one track to another. In this chapter, we 
will develop a state variable model of the disk drive system that will include the 
effect of the flexure mount.
Since we want a lightweight arm and flexure for rapid movement, we must 
consider the effect of the flexure, which is a very thin mount made of spring steel. 
Again, we wish to accurately control the position of the head y(t) as shown in Figure 
3.37(a). We will attempt to derive a model for the system shown in Figure 3.37(a). 
Here we identify the motor mass as M1 and the head mount mass as M2. The flex￾ure spring is represented by the spring constant k. The force u(t) to drive the mass 
M1 is generated by the DC motor. If the spring is absolutely rigid (nonspringy), 
then we obtain the simplified model shown in Figure 3.37(b). Typical parameters 
for the two-mass system are given in Table 3.1.
Let us obtain the transfer function model of the simplified system of 
Figure 3.37(b). Note that M M = +1 2 M g = = 20.5 0.0205 kg. Then we have

3.11 SUMMARY
In this chapter, we have considered the description and analysis of systems in the 
time domain. The concept of the state of a system and the definition of the state 
variables of a system were discussed. The selection of a set of state variables of 
a system was examined, and the nonuniqueness of the state variables was noted. 
The state differential equation and the solution for x(t) were discussed. Alternative 
signal-flow graph and block diagram model structures were considered for repre￾senting the transfer function (or differential equation) of a system. Using Mason’s 
signal-flow gain formula, we noted the ease of obtaining the flow graph model. The 
state differential equation representing the flow graph and block diagram models 
was also examined. The time response of a linear system and its associated transi￾tion matrix was discussed, and the utility of Mason’s signal-flow gain formula for 
obtaining the transition matrix was illustrated. A detailed analysis of a space sta￾tion model development was presented for a realistic scenario where the attitude 
control is accomplished in conjunction with minimizing the actuator control. The 
relationship between modeling with state variable forms and control system design 
was established. The use of control design software to convert a transfer function 
to state variable form and calculate the state transition matrix was discussed and 
illustrated. The chapter concluded with the development of a state variable model 
for the Sequential Design Example: Disk Drive Read System.

P3.16 The dynamics of a controlled submarine are sig￾nificantly different from those of an aircraft, missile, 
or surface ship. This difference results primarily from 
the moment in the vertical plane due to the buoyancy 
effect. Therefore, it is interesting to consider the control 
of the depth of a submarine. The equations describing 
the dynamics of a submarine can be obtained by using 
Newton’s laws and the angles defined in Figure P3.16. 
To simplify the equations, we will assume that θ( )t is a 
small angle and the velocity v is constant and equal to 
25 ft/s. The state variables of the submarine, considering 
only vertical control, are ,   , 1 2  x t( ) = = θ θ ( )t x ( )t t( )
and , x t 3 ( ) = α( )t where α( )t is the angle of attack. 
Thus the state vector differential equation for this sys￾tem, when the submarine has an Albacore type hull, is

P3.29 There has been considerable engineering effort 
directed at finding ways to perform manipulative op￾erations in space—for example, assembling a space 
station and acquiring target satellites. To perform 
such tasks, space shuttles carry a remote manipulator 
system (RMS) in the cargo bay [4, 12, 21]. The RMS 
has proven its effectiveness on recent shuttle mis￾sions, but now a new design approach can be consid￾ered—a manipulator with inflatable arm segments. 
Such a design might reduce manipulator weight by 
a factor of four while producing a manipulator that, 
prior to inflation, occupies only one-eighth as much 
space in the cargo bay as the present RMS.
The use of an RMS for constructing a space structure 
in the shuttle bay is shown in Figure P3.29(a), and a 
model of the flexible RMS arm is shown in Figure 
P3.29(b), where J is the inertia of the drive motor 
and L is the distance to the center of gravity of the

AP3.1 Consider the electromagnetic suspension system 
shown in Figure AP3.1. An electromagnet is located 
at the upper part of the experimental system. Using 
the electromagnetic force f, we want to suspend the

feedback control is indispensable. As a gap sensor, a

is placed below the ball [20].

AP3.4 Front suspensions have become standard equip￾ment on mountain bikes. Replacing the rigid fork 
that attaches the bicycle’s front tire to its frame, such 
suspensions absorb bump impact energy, shielding

forks, however, use only one spring constant and 
treat bump impacts at high and low speeds—impacts 
that vary greatly in severity—essentially the same.
A suspension system with multiple settings that 
are adjustable while the bike is in motion would be 
attractive. One air and coil spring with an oil damper 
is available that permits an adjustment of the damp￾ing constant to the terrain as well as to the rider’s 
weight [17]. The suspension system model is shown 
in Figure AP3.4, where b is adjustable. Select the ap￾propriate value for b so that the bike accommodates

PREVIEW
In this chapter, we explore the role of error signals to characterize feedback 
control system performance, including the reduction of sensitivity to model uncer￾tainties, disturbance rejection, measurement noise attenuation, steady-state errors, 
and transient response characteristics. The error signal is employed in the feed￾back control system via negative feedback. We discuss the sensitivity of a system 
to parameter changes, since it is desirable to minimize the effects of parameter 
variations and uncertainties. We also wish to diminish the effect of unwanted 
disturbances and measurement noise on the ability of the system to track a desired 
input. We then describe the transient and steady-state performance of a feedback 
system and show how this performance can be readily improved with feedback. 
The chapter concludes with a system performance analysis of the Sequential 
Design Example: Disk Drive Read System.

❏ Explain the central role of error signals in analysis of control systems.
❏ Identify the improvements afforded by feedback control in reducing system 
sensitivity to parameter changes, disturbance rejection, and measurement noise 
attenuation.
❏ Describe the differences between controlling the transient response and the 
steady-state response of a system.

4.1 INTRODUCTION
A control system is defined as an interconnection of components forming a system 
that will provide a desired system response. Because the desired system response is 
known, a signal proportional to the error between the desired and the actual response 
is generated. The use of this signal to control the process results in a closed-loop 
sequence of operations that is called a feedback system. This closed-loop sequence 
of operations is shown in Figure 4.1. The introduction of feedback to improve the 
control system is often necessary. It is interesting that this is also the case for sys￾tems in nature, such as biological and physiological systems; feedback is inherent 
in these systems. For example, the human heart rate control system is a feedback 
control system. To illustrate the characteristics and advantages of introducing feed￾back, we consider a single-loop feedback system. Although many control systems 
are multiloop, a thorough comprehension of the benefits of feedback can best be 
obtained from the single-loop system and then extended to multiloop systems.
An open-loop system, or a system without feedback, is shown in Figure 4.2. The 
disturbance, T s d ( ), directly influences the output, Y s( ). In the absence of feedback, 
the control system is highly sensitive to disturbances and to both knowledge of and 
variations in parameters of G s( ).
If the open-loop system does not provide a satisfactory response, then a suitable 
cascade controller, G s c ( ), can be inserted preceding the process, G s( ), as shown in 
Figure 4.3. Then it is necessary to design the cascade transfer function, G s c ( )G s( ), 
so that the resulting transfer function provides the desired transient response. This is 
known as open-loop control.

Despite the cost and increased system complexity, closed-loop feedback 
control has the following advantages:
■ Decreased sensitivity of the system to variations in the parameters of the process.
■ Improved rejection of the disturbances.
■ Improved measurement noise attenuation.
■ Improved reduction of the steady-state error of the system.
■ Easy control and adjustment of the transient response of the system.
In this chapter, we examine how the application of feedback can result in the 
benefits listed above. Using the notion of a tracking error signal, it will be read￾ily apparent that it is possible to utilize feedback with a controller in the loop to 
improve system performance.
4.2 ERROR SIGNAL ANALYSIS
The closed-loop feedback control system shown in Figure 4.4 has three inputs—
R s( ), T s d ( ), and N s( )—and one output, Y s( ). The signals T s d ( ) and N s( )
are the disturbance and measurement noise signals, respectively. Define the 
tracking error as
E s( ) = − R s( ) Y s( ). (4.1)
For ease of discussion, we will consider a unity feedback system, that is, H s( ) = 1,
in Figure 4.4. The influence of a nonunity feedback element in the loop will be con￾sidered later.
After some block diagram manipulation, we find that the output is given by
Y s G s G s

Define the function
L s( ) = G s c ( )G s( ).
The function, L s( ), is known as the loop gain and plays a fundamental role in con￾trol system analysis [12]. In terms of L s( ), the tracking error is given by

We can define the function
F s( ) = +1 . L s( )
M04_DORF2374_14_GE_C04.indd 259 17/09/21 2:17 PM260 Chapter 4 Feedback Control System Characteristics
Then, in terms of F s( ), we define the sensitivity function as
S s
F s L s ( ) ( ) ( ) = = +
1 1
1 . (4.5)
Similarly, in terms of the loop gain, we define the complementary sensitivity function as
C s L s
L s ( ) ( )
( ) = 1 + . (4.6)
In terms of the functions S s( ) and C s( ), we can write the tracking error as
E s( ) = − S s( )R s( ) S s( )G s( )T s d ( ) + C s( )N s( ). (4.7)
Examining Equation (4.7), we see that (for a given G s( )), if we want to minimize the 
tracking error, we want both S s( ) and C s( ) to be small. Remember that S s( ) and 
C s( ) are both functions of the controller, G s c ( ), which the control engineer designs. 
However, the following special relationship between S s( ) and C s( ) holds
S s( ) + = C s( ) 1. (4.8)
Clearly, we cannot simultaneously make S s( ) and C s( ) small, hence design compro￾mises must be made.
To analyze the tracking error equation, we need to understand what it means for 
a transfer function to be “large” or to be “small.” The discussion of magnitude of a 
transfer function is the subject of Chapters 8 and 9 on frequency response methods. 
However, for our purposes here, we describe the magnitude of the loop gain L s( ) by 
considering the magnitude L j ( ) ω over the range of frequencies, ω, of interest.
Considering the tracking error in Equation (4.4), it is evident that, for a given 
G s( ), to reduce the influence of the disturbance, T s d ( ), on the tracking error, E s( ), 
we desire L s( ) to be large over the range of frequencies that characterize the distur -
bances. That way, the transfer function G s( )/(1 ) + L s( ) will be small, thereby 
reducing the influence of T s d ( ). Since L s( ) = G s c ( )G s( ), this implies that we 
need to design the controller G s c ( ) to have a large magnitude over the import￾ant range of frequencies. Conversely, to attenuate the measurement noise, N s( ), 
and reduce the influence on the tracking error, we desire L s( ) to be small over 
the range of frequencies that characterize the measurement noise. The transfer 
function L s( )/ (1 ) + L s( )) will be small, thereby reducing the influence of N s( ). 
Again, since L s( ) = G s c ( )G s( ), that implies that we need to design the controller 
G s c ( ) to have a small magnitude over the important range of frequencies. Fortunately, 
the apparent conflict between wanting to make G s c ( ) large to reject disturbances and 
the wanting to make G s c ( ) small to attenuate measurement noise can be addressed 
in the design phase by making the loop gain, L s( ), large at low frequencies (generally 
associated with the frequency range of disturbances), and making L s( ) small at high 
frequencies (generally associated with measurement noise).
More discussion on disturbance rejection and measurement noise attenuation 
follows in the subsequent sections. Next, we discuss how we can use feedback to re￾duce the sensitivity of the system to variations and uncertainty in parameters in the 
process, G s( ). This is accomplished by analyzing the tracking error in Equation (4.2) 
when T s d ( ) = = N s( ) 0.
M04_DORF2374_14_GE_C04.indd 260 17/09/21 2:17 PMSection 4.3 Sensitivity of Control Systems to Parameter Variations 261
4.3 SENSITIVITY OF CONTROL SYSTEMS TO PARAMETER VARIATIONS
A process, represented by the transfer function G s( ) is subject to a changing envi￾ronment, aging, uncertainty in the exact values of the process parameters, and other 
factors that affect a control process. In the open-loop system, all these errors and 
changes result in a changing and inaccurate output. However, a closed-loop system 
senses the change in the output due to the process changes and attempts to correct 
the output. The sensitivity of a control system to parameter variations is of prime 
importance. A primary advantage of a closed-loop feedback control system is its 
ability to reduce the system’s sensitivity [1–4, 18].
For the closed-loop case, if G s c ( )G s( )  1 for all complex frequencies of inter￾est, we can use Equation (4.2) to obtain (letting T s d ( ) = 0 and N s( ) = 0)
Y s( ) ≅ R s( ).
The output is approximately equal to the input. However, the condition G s c ( )G s( )  1
may cause the system response to be highly oscillatory and even unstable. But the fact 
that increasing the magnitude of the loop gain reduces the effect of G s( ) on the out￾put is a useful result. Therefore, the first advantage of a feedback system is that the 
effect of the variation of the parameters of the process, G s( ), is reduced.
Suppose the process (or plant) G s( ) undergoes a change such that the true 
plant model is G s( ) + ∆G s( ). The change in the plant may be due to a changing 
external environment or it may represent the uncertainty in certain plant parame￾ters. We consider the effect on the tracking error E s( ) due to ∆G s( ). Utilizing the 
principle of superposition, we let T s d ( ) = = N s( ) 0 and consider only the reference 
input R s( ). From Equation (4.3), it follows that

We see that the change in the tracking error is reduced by the factor 1 , + L s( ) which 
is generally greater than 1 over the range of frequencies of interest.

Larger magnitude L s( ) translates into smaller changes in the tracking error (that is, 
reduced sensitivity to changes in ∆G s( ) in the process). Also, larger L s( ) implies 
smaller sensitivity, S s( ). The question arises, how do we define sensitivity?
M04_DORF2374_14_GE_C04.indd 261 17/09/21 2:18 PM262 Chapter 4 Feedback Control System Characteristics
The sensitivity of the open-loop system to changes in the plant G s( ) is equal to 1. 
The sensitivity of the closed-loop is readily obtained by using Equation (4.12). The 
system transfer function of the closed-loop system is

We find that the sensitivity of the system may be reduced below that of the open￾loop system by increasing L s( ) = G s c ( )G s( ) over the frequency range of interest. 
Note that SG
T in Equation (4.12) is exactly the same as the sensitivity function S s( )
given in Equation (4.5).
Often, we seek to determine Sα
T , where α is a parameter within the transfer 
function, G s( ). Using the chain rule yields
S S α α = S T

The system sensitivity is defined as the ratio of the percentage change in the 
system transfer function to the percentage change of the process transfer function. 
The system transfer function is

An important advantage of feedback control systems is the ability to reduce the 
effect of the variation of parameters of a control system by adding a feedback loop. 
To obtain highly accurate open-loop systems, the components of the open-loop, 
G s( ), must be selected carefully in order to meet the exact specifications. However, 
a closed-loop system allows G s( ) to be less accurately specified because the sensi￾tivity to changes or errors in G s( ) is reduced by the loop gain L s( ). This benefit of 
closed-loop systems is a profound advantage. A simple example will illustrate the 
value of feedback for reducing sensitivity.
EXAMPLE 4.1 Feedback amplifier
An amplifier used in many applications has a gain −Ka, as shown in Figure 4.5(a). 
The output voltage is
V s o i ( ) = −K Va n ( )s . (4.17)
We often add feedback using a potentiometer Rp, as shown in Figure 4.5(b). The 
transfer function of the amplifier without feedback is
T s( ) = −Ka, (4.18)
and the sensitivity to changes in the amplifier gain is

4.4 DISTURBANCE SIGNALS IN A FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEM
Many control systems are subject to extraneous disturbance signals that cause the 
system to provide an inaccurate output. Electronic amplifiers have inherent noise 
generated within the integrated circuits or transistors; radar antennas are subjected 
to wind gusts; and many systems generate unwanted distortion signals due to non￾linear elements. An important effect of feedback in a control system is the reduction

of the effect of disturbance signals. A disturbance signal is an unwanted input signal 
that affects the output signal. The benefit of feedback systems is that the effect of 
distortion, noise, and unwanted disturbances can be effectively reduced.
Disturbance Rejection
When R s( ) = = N s( ) 0, it follows from Equation (4.4) that
E s S s G s T s G s
L s ( ) ( ) ( ) d d ( ) T s ( )
( ) = − = − ( ) 1 +   .
For a fixed G s( ) and a given T s d ( ), as the loop gain L s( ) increases, the effect of T s d ( )
on the tracking error decreases. In other words, the sensitivity function S s( ) is small 
when the loop gain is large. We say that large loop gain leads to good disturbance 
rejection. More precisely, for good disturbance rejection, we require a large loop gain 
over the frequencies of interest associated with the expected disturbance signals.
In practice, the disturbance signals are often low frequency. When that is the 
case, we say that we want the loop gain to be large at low frequencies. This is equiv￾alent to stating that we want to design the controller G s c ( ) so that the sensitivity 
function S s( ) is small at low frequencies.
As a specific example of a system with an unwanted disturbance, let us consider 
again the speed control system for a steel rolling mill [19]. The rolls, which process 
steel, are subjected to large load changes or disturbances. As a steel bar approaches 
the rolls (see Figure 4.7), the rolls are empty. However, when the bar engages in the 
rolls, the load on the rolls increases immediately to a large value. This loading effect 
can be approximated by a step change of disturbance torque.
The transfer function model of an armature-controlled DC motor with a load 
torque disturbance was determined in Example 2.5 and is shown in Figure 4.8, 
where it is assumed that La is negligible. Let R s( ) = 0 and examine E s( ) = −ω( )s ,
for a disturbance T s d ( ).

The closed-loop speed control system is shown in block diagram form in Figure 4.9. 
The closed-loop system is shown in signal-flow graph and block diagram form in 
Figure  4.10, where G s 1 2 ( ) = / K Ka m R G a,   ( )s J = /1 , ( ) s b + and H s( ) = + K K t b/Ka.

As the loop gain L s( ) decreases, the effect of N s( ) on the tracking error decreases. 
In other words, the complementary sensitivity function C s( ) is small when the loop 
gain L s( ) is small. If we design G s c ( ) such that L s( )  1, then the noise is attenu￾ated because
C s( ) ≈ L s( ).
We see that small loop gain leads to good noise attenuation. More precisely, for 
effective measurement noise attenuation, we need a small loop gain over the fre￾quencies associated with the expected noise signals.
In practice, measurement noise signals are often high frequency. Thus we want 
the loop gain to be low at high frequencies. This is equivalent to a small comple￾mentary sensitivity function at high frequencies. The separation of disturbances 
(at low frequencies) and measurement noise (at high frequencies) is very fortunate 
because it gives the control system designer a way to approach the design process: 
the controller should be high gain at low frequencies and low gain at high frequen￾cies. Remember that by low and high we mean that the loop gain magnitude is 
low/high at the various high/low frequencies. It is not always the case that the dis￾turbances are low frequency or that the measurement noise is high frequency. If 
the frequency separation does not exist, the design process usually becomes more 
involved (for example, we may have to use notch filters to reject disturbances at 
known high frequencies). A noise signal that is prevalent in many systems is the 
noise generated by the measurement sensor. This noise, N s( ), can be represented as 
shown in Figure 4.4. The effect of the noise on the output is

which is approximately
Y s( )  −N s( ), (4.35)
for large loop gain L s( ) = G s c ( )G s( ). This is consistent with the earlier discussion 
that smaller loop gain leads to measurement noise attentuation. Clearly, the designer 
must shape the loop gain appropriately.
The equivalency of sensitivity, SG
T , and the response of the closed-loop system 
tracking error to a reference input can be illustrated by considering Figure 4.4. The 
sensitivity of the system to G s( ) is

In both cases, we find that the undesired effects can be alleviated by increasing 
the loop gain. Feedback in control systems primarily reduces the sensitivity of the

system to parameter variations and the effect of disturbance inputs. Note that the 
measures taken to reduce the effects of parameter variations or disturbances are 
equivalent, and fortunately, they reduce simultaneously. As a final illustration, con￾sider the effect of the noise on the tracking error,

We find that the undesired effects of measurement noise can be alleviated by 
decreasing the loop gain. Keeping in mind the relationship
S s( ) + = C s( ) 1,
the trade-off in the design process is evident.
4.5 CONTROL OF THE TRANSIENT RESPONSE
One of the most important characteristics of control systems is their transient 
response. The transient response is the response of a system as a function of time 
before steady-state. Because the purpose of control systems is to provide a desired 
response, the transient response often must be adjusted until it is satisfactory. If an 
open-loop control system does not provide a satisfactory response, then the loop 
transfer function, G s c ( )G s( ), must be adjusted. To make this concept more compre￾hensible, consider a specific control system which may be operated in an open- or 
closed-loop manner. A speed control system, as shown in Figure 4.11, is often used 
in industrial processes to move materials and products. The transfer function of the 
open-loop system (without feedback) is given by

In the case of a steel mill, the inertia of the rolls is quite large, and a large 
armature-controlled motor is required. If the steel rolls are subjected to a step command

The transient speed change is then
t KaK k E e t ω( ) = − ( )( ) − τ 1 2 1 . / 1 (4.42)
If this transient response is too slow, we must choose another motor with a 
different time constant τ1, if possible. However, because τ1 is dominated by the 
load inertia, J, it may not be possible to achieve much alteration of the transient 
response.
A closed-loop speed control system is easily obtained by using a tachometer 
to generate a voltage proportional to the speed, as shown in Figure 4.12(b). This 
voltage is subtracted from the potentiometer voltage and amplified as shown in 
Figure 4.12. The closed-loop transfer function is

For a typical application, the open-loop pole might be 1/τ1 = 0.10, whereas the 
closed-loop pole could be at least ( ) K Ka tK1 1 / 1 τ = 0, a factor of one hundred in 
the improvement of the speed of response. To attain the gain K Ka tK1, the am￾plifier gain Ka must be reasonably large, and the armature voltage signal to the 
motor and its associated torque signal must be larger for the closed-loop than for 
the open-loop operation. Therefore, a higher-power motor will be required to avoid 
saturation of the motor. The responses of the closed-loop system and the open-loop 
system are shown in Figure 4.13. Note the rapid response of the closed-loop system 
relative to the open-loop system.
While we are considering this speed control system, it will be worthwhile to 
determine the sensitivity of the open- and closed-loop systems. As before, the sensitiv￾ity of the open-loop system to a variation in the motor constant or the potentiometer 
constant k2 is unity. The sensitivity of the closed-loop system to a variation in Km is

frequency—for example, s j = = ω j1—the magnitude of the sensitivity is approxi￾mately ST
K ≅ m 0.1.
4.6 STEADY-STATE ERROR
A feedback control system provides the engineer with the ability to adjust the tran￾sient response. In addition, as we have seen, the sensitivity of the system and the 
effect of disturbances can be reduced significantly. However, as a further require￾ment, we must examine and compare the final steady-state error for an open-loop 
and a closed-loop system. The steady-state error is the error after the transient 
response has decayed, leaving only the continuous response.
The error of the open-loop control system shown in Figure 4.3 is
E s 0 ( ) =−= R s( ) Y s( ) (1 − G s c ( )G s( )) , R s( ) (4.46)
when T s d ( ) = 0. Figure 4.4 shows the closed-loop system. When T s d ( ) = 0 and 
N s( ) = 0, and we let H s( ) = 1, the tracking error is given by

The value of G s c ( )G s( ) when s = 0 is often called the DC gain and is normally 
greater than one. Therefore, the open-loop control system will usually have a 
steady-state error of significant magnitude. By contrast, the closed-loop system with 
a reasonably large DC loop gain L G ( ) 0 0 = c ( )G( ) 0 will have a small steady-state 
error.
Upon examination of Equation (4.49), we note that the open-loop control sys￾tem can possess a zero steady-state error by adjusting and calibrating the systems 
DC gain, G G c ( ) 0 0( ), so that G G c ( ) 0 0( ) = 1. Therefore, we may logically ask, What 
M04_DORF2374_14_GE_C04.indd 272 17/09/21 2:18 PMSection 4.6 Steady-State Error 273
is the advantage of the closed-loop system in this case? To answer this question, we 
return to the concept of the sensitivity of the system to parameter uncertainty in 
G s( ) and changes over time in those parameters. In the open-loop control system, 
we may calibrate the system so that G G c ( ) 0 0( ) = 1, but during the operation of the 
system, it is inevitable that the parameters of G s( ) will change due to environmen￾tal changes and that the DC gain of the system will no longer be equal to 1. Because 
it is an open-loop control system, the steady-state error will not equal zero. By con￾trast, the closed-loop feedback system continually monitors the steady-state error 
and provides an actuating signal to reduce the steady-state error. Because systems 
are susceptible to parameter drift, environmental effects, and calibration errors, 
negative feedback provides benefits.
The advantage of the closed-loop system is that it reduces the steady-state error 
resulting from parameter changes and calibration errors. This may be illustrated by 
an example. Consider a unity feedback system with a process transfer function and 
controller

respectively. Which could represent a thermal control process, a voltage regulator, or 
a water-level control process. For a specific setting of the desired input variable, which 
may be represented by the normalized unit step input function, we have R s( ) = /1 .s
Then the steady-state error of the open-loop system is, as in Equation (4.49),
e G 0( ) ∞ = 1 0 − = c a ( )G K ( ) 0 1 − K (4.52)
when a consistent set of dimensional units is utilized for R s( ) and KKa. The error 
for the closed-loop system is
E s c ( ) = − R s( ) T s( )R s( )
where T s( ) = / G s c c ( )G s( ) (1 + G s( )G s( )). The steady-state error is

For the open-loop control system, we would calibrate the system so that KKa = 1
and the steady-state error is zero. For the closed-loop system, we would set a large 
gain KKa. If KKa = 100, the closed-loop system steady-state error is ec ( ) ∞ = 1/101.
If the process gain drifts or changes by ∆ / K K = 0.1 (a 10% change), the mag￾nitude of the open-loop steady-state error is ∆ ∞ eo ( ) = 0.1. Then the percent

or 10%. By contrast, the steady-state error of the closed-loop system, with 
∆ = K K/ 0.1, is ec ( ) ∞ = 1/91 if the gain decreases. Thus, the change is

or 0.11%. This is a significant improvement, since the closed-loop relative change is 
two orders of magnitude lower than that of the open-loop system.
4.7 THE COST OF FEEDBACK
The advantages of using feedback control have an attendant cost. The first cost of feed￾back is an increased number of components and complexity in the system. To add the 
feedback, it is necessary to consider several feedback components; the measurement 
component (sensor) is the key one. The sensor is often the most expensive component 
in a control system. Furthermore, the sensor introduces noise into the system.
The second cost of feedback is the loss of gain. For example, in a single-loop 
system, the loop gain is G s c ( )G s( ) and is reduced to G s c c ( )G s( ) / (1 ) + G s( )G s( ) in 
a unity negative feedback system. The closed-loop gain is smaller by a factor of 
1/(1 + G s( )G s( )), c which is exactly the factor that reduces the sensitivity of the 
system to parameter variations and disturbances. Usually, we have extra loop gain 
available, and we are more than willing to trade it for increased control of the sys￾tem response.
The final cost of feedback is the introduction of the possibility of instability. 
Even when the open-loop system is stable, the closed-loop system may not be 
always stable.
The addition of feedback to dynamic systems causes more challenges for the 
designer. However, for most cases, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages, 
and a feedback system is desirable. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the addi￾tional complexity and the problem of stability when designing a control system.
We want the output of the system, Y s( ), to equal the input, R s( ). We might 
ask,  Why not set G s c ( )G s( ) = 1? (See Figure 4.3, assuming T s d ( ) = 0.) In other 
words, why not let G s c ( ) be the inverse of the process G s( ). The answer to this 
question becomes apparent once we recall that the process G s( ) represents a real 
process and possesses dynamics that may not appear directly in the transfer func￾tion model. Additionally, the parameter in G s( ) may be uncertain or vary with 
time. Hence, we cannot perfectly set G s c ( )G s( ) = 1 in practice. There are other 
issues that also arise, thus it is not advisable to design the open-loop control system 
in this fashion.

4.8 DESIGN EXAMPLES
In this section we present two illustrative examples: the English Channel boring 
machine and a blood pressure control problem during anesthesia. The English 
Channel boring machine example focuses on the closed-loop system response to 
disturbances. The example on blood pressure control is a more in-depth look at the 
control design problem. Since patient models in the form of transfer functions are 
difficult to obtain from basic biological and physical principles, a different approach 
using measured data is discussed. The positive impact of closed-loop feedback con￾trol is illustrated in the context of design.
EXAMPLE 4.2 English Channel boring machines
The tunnel under the English Channel from France to Great Britain is 23.5 miles 
long and is bored 250 feet below sea level at its lowest-point. The tunnel is a critical 
link between Europe and Great Britain, making it possible to travel from London 
to Paris in 2 hours and 15 minutes using the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (known as 
High Speed 1).
The boring machines, operating from both ends of the channel, bored toward 
the middle. To link up accurately in the middle of the channel, a laser guidance 
system kept the machines precisely aligned. A model of the boring machine control 
is shown in Figure 4.14, where Y s( ) is the actual angle of direction of travel of the 
boring machine and R s( ) is the desired angle. The effect of load on the machine is 
represented by the disturbance, T s d ( ).
The design objective is to select the gain K so that the response to input angle 
changes is desirable while we maintain minimal error due to the disturbance. The 
output due to the two inputs is
Y s K s

s s K ( ) = ( ) T s d ( ) +

Thus, to reduce the effect of the disturbance, we wish to set the gain greater than 10. 
When we select K = 100 and let the disturbance be zero, we have the step response 
for a unit step input r t( ), as shown in Figure 4.15. When the input r t( ) = 0 and we 
determine the response to the unit step disturbance, we obtain y t( ) as shown in 
Figure 4.15. The effect of the disturbance is quite small. If we set the gain K equal 
to 20, we obtain the responses of y t( ) due to a unit step input r t( ) and disturbance

22% and the settling time is 0.7 s. When K = 20, the percent overshoot is 3.9% and 
the settling time is 0.9 s.

In this case, we choose K = 20 for a reasonable design compromise. ■
EXAMPLE 4.3 Blood pressure control during anesthesia
The objectives of anethesia are to eliminate pain, awareness, and natural reflexes so 
that surgery can be conducted safely. Before about 150 years ago, alcohol, opium, 
and cannabis were used to achieve these goals, but they proved inadequate [23]. 
Pain relief was insufficient both in magnitude and duration; too little pain medica￾tion and the patient felt great pain, too much medication and the patient died or 
became comatose. In the 1850s ether was used successfully in the United States in 
tooth extractions, and shortly thereafter other means of achieving unconsciousness 
safely were developed, including the use of chloroform and nitrous oxide.
In a modern operating room, the depth of anesthesia is the responsibility of the 
anesthetist. Many vital parameters, such as blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, 
blood oxygenation, and exhaled carbon dioxide, are controlled within acceptable 
bounds by the anesthetist. Of course, to ensure patient safety, adequate anesthesia 
must be maintained during the entire surgical procedure. Any assistance that the 
anesthetist can obtain automatically will increase the safety margins by freeing the 
anesthetist to attend to other functions not easily automated. This is an example of 
human computer interaction for the overall control of a process. Clearly, patient 
safety is the ultimate objective. Our control goal then is to develop an automated 
system to regulate the depth of anesthesia. This function is amenable to automatic 
control and in fact is in routine use in clinical applications [24, 25].
We consider how to measure the depth of anesthesia. Many anesthetists 
regard mean arterial pressure (MAP) as the most reliable measure of the depth of 
anesthesia [26]. The level of the MAP serves as a guide for the delivery of inhaled 
anesthesia. Based on clinical experience and the procedures followed by the anes￾thetist, we determine that the variable to be controlled is the mean arterial pressure.
The elements of the control system design process emphasized in this example 
are illustrated in Figure 4.17. From the control system design perspective, the con￾trol goal can be stated in more concrete terms:
Control Goal
Regulate the mean arterial pressure to any desired set-point and maintain 
the prescribed set-point in the presence of unwanted disturbances.
M04_DORF2374_14_GE_C04.indd 277 17/09/21 2:18 PM278 Chapter 4 Feedback Control System Characteristics
Associated with the stated control goal, we identify the variable to be controlled:
Variable to Be Controlled
Mean arterial pressure (MAP).
Because it is our desire to develop a system that will be used in clinical appli￾cations, it is essential to establish realistic design specifications. In general terms 
the control system should have minimal complexity while satisfying the control 
specifications. Minimal complexity translates into increased system reliability and 
decreased cost.
The closed-loop system should respond rapidly and smoothly to changes in the 
MAP set-point (made by the anesthetist) without excessive overshoot. The closed￾loop system should minimize the effects of unwanted disturbances. There are two 
important categories of disturbances: surgical disturbances, such as skin incisions 
and measurement errors, such as calibration errors and random stochastic noise. 
Three PID controllers given.

For example, a skin incision can increase the MAP rapidly by 10 mmHg [26]. Finally, 
since we want to apply the same control system to many different patients and we 
cannot (for practical reasons) have a separate model for each patient, we must have 
a closed-loop system that is insensitive to changes in the process parameters (that is, 
it meets the specifications for many different people).
Based on clinical experience [24], we can explicitly state the control specifica￾tions as follows:
Control Design Specifications
DS1 Settling time less than 20 minutes for a 10% step change from the MAP set-point.
DS2 Percent overshoot less than 15% for a 10% step change from the MAP set-point.
DS3 Zero steady-state tracking error to a step change from the MAP set-point.
DS4 Zero steady-state error to a step surgical disturbance input (of magnitude 
d t( ) ≤ 50) with a maximum response less than ±5% of the MAP set-point.
DS5 Minimum sensitivity to process parameter changes.
We cover the notion of percent overshoot (DS1) and settling time (DS2) more thor￾oughly in Chapter 5. They fall more naturally in the category of system performance. 
The remaining three design specifications, DS3–DS5, covering steady-state track￾ing errors (DS3), disturbance rejection (DS4), and system sensitivity to parameter 
changes (DS5) are the main topics of this chapter. The last specification, DS5, is 
somewhat vague; however, this is a characteristic of many real-world specifications. 
In the system configuration, Figure 4.18, we identify the major system elements as 
the controller, anesthesia pump/vaporizer, sensor, and patient.
The system input R s( ) is the desired mean arterial pressure change, and the 
output Y s( ) is the actual pressure change. The difference between the desired 
and the measured blood pressure change forms a signal used by the controller to 
determine value settings to the pump/vaporizer that delivers anesthesia vapor to 
the patient.

The model of the pump/vaporizer depends directly on the mechanical design. 
We will assume a simple pump/vaporizer, where the rate of change of the output 
vapor is equal to the input valve setting, or
u t ˙ . ( ) = υ( )t
The transfer function of the pump is thus given by
G s U s
V s s p ( ) ( )
( ) = = 1
. (4.62)
This is equivalent to saying that, from an input–output perspective, the pump has 
the impulse response
h t( ) = ≥ 1 0 t .
Developing an accurate model of a patient is much more involved. Because 
the physiological systems in the patient (especially in a sick patient) are not eas￾ily modeled, a modeling procedure based on knowledge of the underlying physical 
processes is not practical. Even if such a model could be developed, it would, in 
general, be a nonlinear, time-varying, multi-input, multi-output model. This type 
of model is not directly applicable here in our linear, time-invariant, single-input, 
single-output system setting.
On the other hand, if we view the patient as a system and take an input–output 
perspective, we can use the familiar concept of an impulse response. Then if we 
restrict ourselves to small changes in blood pressure from a given set-point (such as 
100 mmHg), we might make the case that in a small region around the set-point the 
patient behaves in a linear time-invariant fashion. This approach fits well into our 
requirement to maintain the blood pressure around a given set-point (or baseline). 
The impulse response approach to modeling the patient response to anesthesia has 
been used successfully in the past [27].
Suppose that we take a black-box approach and obtain the impulse response 
in Figure 4.19 for a hypothetical patient. Notice that the impulse response initially 
has a time delay. This reflects the fact that it takes a finite amount of time for the 
patient MAP to respond to the infusion of anesthesia vapor. We ignore the time￾delay in our design and analysis, but we do so with caution. In subsequent chapters 
we will learn to handle time delays. We keep in mind that the delay does exist and 
should be considered in the analysis at some point.
A reasonable fit of the data shown in Figure 4.19 is given by
y t te t pt ( ) = ≥ − 0,
where p = 2 and time ( )t is measured in minutes. Different patients are associated 
with different values of the parameter p. The corresponding transfer function is
G s
( ) s p
( ) =
+
1 . 2 (4.63)
For the sensor we assume a perfect noise-free measurement and
H s( ) = 1. (4.64)
Therefore, we have a unity feedback system.

where R s( ) = / R s 0 is a step input of magnitude R0. Therefore,

With a PID controller, we expect a zero steady-state tracking error (to a step input) 
for any nonzero values of K K P D ,   , and KI. The integral term, K s I/ , in the PID 
controller is the reason that the steady-state error to a unit step is zero. Thus design 
specification DS3 is satisfied.
When considering the effect of a step disturbance input, we let R s( ) = 0 and 
N s( ) = 0. We want the steady-state output Y s( ) to be zero for a step disturbance.

We must evaluate the sensitivity function Sp
T , at various values of frequency. For 
low frequencies we can approximate the system sensitivity Sp
T by
S p s
K p
T
I
≈ 2 . 2 2
So at low frequencies and for a given p we can reduce the system sensitivity to vari￾ations in p by increasing the PID gain, KI. Suppose that three PID gain sets have 
been proposed, as shown in Table 4.1. With p = 2 and the PID gains given as the 
cases 1–3 in Table 4.1, we can plot the magnitude of the sensitivity Sp
T as a function 
of frequency for each PID controller. The result is shown in Figure 4.20. We see that 
by using the PID 3 controller with the gains K K P D = = 6,   4, and KI = 4, we have 
the smallest system sensitivity (at low frequencies) to changes in the process param￾eter, p. PID 3 is the controller with the largest gain KI. As the frequency increases 
we see in Figure 4.20 that the sensitivity increases, and that PID 3 has the highest 
peak sensitivity.

Now we consider the transient response. Suppose we want to reduce the MAP 
by a 10% step change. The associated input is
R s R
s s
( ) = = 10 . 0
The step response for each PID controller is shown in Figure 4.21. PID 1 and PID 2 
meet the settling time and overshoot specifications; however PID 3 has excessive 
overshoot. The overshoot is the amount the system output exceeds the desired steady￾state response. In this case the desired steady-state response is a 10% decrease in the 
baseline MAP. When a 15% overshoot is realized, the MAP is decreased by 11.5%, 
as illustrated in Figure 4.21. The settling time is the time required for the system out￾put to settle within a certain percentage (for example, 2%) of the desired steady-state 
output amplitude. We cover the notions of overshoot and settling time more thor￾oughly in Chapter 5. The overshoot and settling times are summarized in Table 4.1.
We conclude the analysis by considering the disturbance response. From previ￾ous analysis we know that the transfer function from the disturbance input T s d ( ) to 
the output Y s( ) is

This is the maximum magnitude disturbance ( 5 T t d ( ) = = D0 0). Since any step 
disturbance of smaller magnitude (that is, T t d ( ) = < D0 50) will result in a smaller 
maximum output response, we need only to consider the maximum magnitude step 
disturbance input when determining whether design specification DS4 is satisfied.
The unit step disturbance for each PID controller is shown in Figure 4.22. 
Controller PID 2 meets design specification DS4 with a maximum response less 
than +−5% of the MAP set-point, while controllers PID 1 and 3 nearly meet the 
specification. The peak output values for each controller are summarized in Table 4.1.
In summary, given the three PID controllers, we would select PID 2 as the con￾troller of choice. It meets all the design specifications while providing a reasonable 
insensitivity to changes in the plant parameter. ■
4.9 CONTROL SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS USING CONTROL DESIGN SOFTWARE
In this section, the advantages of feedback will be illustrated with two examples. In 
the first example, we will introduce feedback control to a speed tachometer system 
in an effort to reject disturbances. The tachometer speed control system example 
can be found in Section 4.5. The reduction in system sensitivity to process varia￾tions, adjustment of the transient response, and reduction in steady-state error will 
be demonstrated using the English Channel boring machine example of Section 4.8.
EXAMPLE 4.4 Speed control system
The open-loop block diagram description of the armature-controlled DC motor 
with a load torque disturbance T s d ( ) is shown in Figure 4.8. The values for the vari￾ous parameters are given in Table 4.2. We have two inputs to our system, V s a ( ) and

T s d ( ). Relying on the principle of superposition, which applies to our linear system, 
we consider each input separately. To investigate the effects of disturbances on the 
system, we let V s a ( ) = 0 and consider only the disturbance T s d ( ). Conversely, to 
investigate the response of the system to a reference input, we let T s d ( ) = 0 and 
consider only the input V s a ( ).
The closed-loop speed tachometer control system block diagram is shown in 
Figure 4.9. The values for Ka and Kt are given in Table 4.2.
If our system displays good disturbance rejection, then we expect the 
disturbance T s d ( ) to have a small effect on the output ω( )s . Consider the open-loop 
system in Figure 4.8 first. We can compute the transfer function from T s d ( ) to ω( )s
and evaluate the output response to a unit step disturbance (that is, T s d ( ) = 1 / s).
The time response to a unit step disturbance is shown in Figure 4.23(a). The script 
shown in Figure 4.23(b) is used to analyze the open-loop speed tachometer system.

where sys_o represents the open-loop transfer function in the script. Since our 
desired value of ω( )t is zero (remember that V s a ( ) = 0), the steady-state error is 
just the final value of ω( )t , which we denote by ωo ( )t to indicate open-loop. The 
steady-state error, shown on the plot in Figure 4.23(a), is approximately the value 
of the speed when t = 7 s. We can obtain an approximate value of the steady-state 
error by looking at the last value in the output vector y , o which we computed in 
the process of generating the plot in Figure 4.23(a). The approximate steady-state 
value of ωo is
ω ω o o ( ) ∞ ≈ ( )7 = −0.66 rad/s.
The plot verifies that we have reached steady state.
In a similar fashion, we begin the closed-loop system analysis by computing 
the closed-loop transfer function from T s d ( ) to ω( )s and then generating the time￾response of ω( )t to a unit step disturbance input. The output response and the script 
are shown in Figure 4.24. The closed-loop transfer function from the disturbance 
input (from Equation (4.30)) is

As before, the steady-state error is just the final value of ω( )t , which we denote 
by t ωc ( ) to indicate that it is a closed-loop. The steady-state error is shown on the 
plot in Figure 4.24(a). We can obtain an approximate value of the steady-state 
error by looking at the last value in the output vector y , c which we computed in 
the process of generating the plot in Figure 4.24(a). The approximate steady-state 
value of ω is
ω ω c c ( ) ∞ ≈ ( ) 0.02 = −0.002 rad/s.
We generally expect that ω ω c o ( ) ∞ ∞ / ( ) < 0.02. In this example, the ratio of closed￾loop to open-loop steady-state speed output due to a unit step disturbance input is

We have achieved a remarkable improvement in disturbance rejection. It is clear 
that the addition of the negative feedback loop reduced the effect of the disturbance 
on the output. This demonstrates the disturbance rejection property of closed-loop 
feedback systems.

The effect of the control gain, K, on the transient response is shown in Figure 4.25 
along with the script used to generate the plots. Comparing the two plots in parts (a) 
and (b), it is apparent that decreasing K decreases the overshoot. Although it is not 
as obvious from the plots in Figure 4.25, it is also true that decreasing K increases

the settling time. This can be verified by taking a closer look at the data used to 
generate the plots. This example demonstrates how the transient response can be 
altered by feedback control gain, K. Based on our analysis thus far, we would pre￾fer to use K = 20. Other considerations must be taken into account before we can

Before making the final choice of K, it is important to consider the system re￾sponse to a unit step disturbance, as shown in Figure 4.26. We see that increasing K
reduces the steady-state response of y t( ) to the step disturbance. The steady-state 
value of y t( ) is 0.05 and 0.01 for K = 20 and 100, respectively. The steady-state

If our only design consideration is disturbance rejection, we would prefer to use 
K = 100.
We have just experienced a common trade-off situation in control system 
design. In this particular example, increasing K leads to better disturbance rejec￾tion, whereas decreasing K leads to better performance (that is, less overshoot). 
The final decision on how to choose K rests with the designer. Although control 
design software can certainly assist in the control system design, it cannot replace 
the engineer’s decision-making capability and intuition.
The final step in the analysis is to look at the system sensitivity to changes in the 
process. The system sensitivity is given by (Equation 4.60),

We can compute the values of S s( ) G
T for different values of s and generate a plot of the

Increasing the gain K reduces the system sensitivity. The system sensitivity plots 
when s j = ω are shown in Figure 4.27 for K = 20. ■
4.10 SEQUENTIAL DESIGN EXAMPLE: DISK DRIVE READ SYSTEM
The design of a disk drive system is an exercise in compromise and optimiza￾tion. The disk drive must accurately position the head reader while being able 
to reduce the effects of parameter changes and external shocks and vibrations.

The mechanical arm and flexure will resonate at frequencies that may be caused 
by excitations such as a shock to a notebook computer. Disturbances to the op￾eration of the disk drive include physical shocks, wear or wobble in the spindle 
bearings, and parameter changes due to component changes. In this section, we 
will examine the performance of the disk drive system in response to disturbances 
and changes in system parameters. In addition, we examine the steady-state error 
of the system for a step command and the transient response as the amplifier gain 
Ka is adjusted.
Let us consider the system shown in Figure 4.28. This closed-loop system uses 
an amplifier with a variable gain as the controller, and the transfer functions are

Then the steady-state error is e( ) ∞ = 0 for a step input. This performance is ob￾tained in spite of changes in the system parameters.

Using the script shown in Figure 4.30(a), we obtain the response of the system for 
Ka = 10 and Ka = 80, shown in Figure 4.30(b). Clearly, the system is faster in 
responding to the command input when Ka = 80, but the response is unacceptably 
oscillatory.
Now let us determine the effect of the disturbance T s d ( ) = /1 s when R s( ) = 0.

the effect of the disturbance, we would need to raise Ka above 80. However, the

chapter, we attempt to determine the best value for Ka, given our requirement for a

4.11 SUMMARY
The fundamental reasons for using feedback, despite its cost and additional com￾plexity, are as follows:
1. Decrease in the sensitivity of the system to variations in the parameters of the process.
2. Improvement in the rejection of the disturbances.
3. Improvement in the attenuation of measurement noise.
4. Improvement in the reduction of the steady-state error of the system.
5. Ease of control and adjustment of the transient response of the system.
The loop gain L s( ) = G s c ( )G s( ) plays a fundamental role in control system 
analysis. Associated with the loop gain we can define the sensitivity and comple￾mentary sensitivity functions as

respectively. The tracking error is given by
E s( ) = − S s( )R s( ) S s( )G s( )T s d ( ) + C s( )N s( ).
In order to minimize the tracking error, E s( ), we desire to make S s( ) and C s( )
small. Because the sensitivity and complementary sensitivity functions satisfy the 
constraint
S s( ) + = C s( ) 1,
we are faced with the fundamental trade-off in control system design between re￾jecting disturbances and reducing sensitivity to plant changes on the one hand, and 
attenuating measurement noise on the other hand.
Feedback control systems possess many beneficial characteristics. Thus, it is 
not surprising that there is a multitude of feedback control systems in industry, 
government, and nature.

Figure E4.14. The system has two parameters, the con￾troller gain K and the constant K1 in the process.

transfer function to changes in K . 1

For a closed-loop feedback system, a float-level sen￾sor and valve may be used as shown in Figure P4.1. 
Assuming the float is a negligible mass, the valve is 
controlled so that a reduction in the flow rate, ΔQ , 1
is proportional to an increase in head, ΔH, or 
ΔQ K 1 = − ΔH. Draw a signal flow graph or block 
diagram. Determine and compare the open-loop and 
closed-loop systems for (a) sensitivity to changes in the 
equivalent coefficient R and the feedback coefficient 
K, (b) the ability to reduce the effects of a disturbance 
in the level ΔH s( ), and (c) the steady-state error of 
the level (head) for a step change of the input Δ . Q s 1 ( )
P4.2 It is important to ensure passenger comfort on 
ships by stabilizing the ship’s oscillations due to 
waves [13]. Most ship stabilization systems use fins 
or hydrofoils projecting into the water to generate 
a stabilization torque on the ship. A simple diagram 
of a ship stabilization system is shown in Figure P4.2. 
The rolling motion of a ship can be regarded as an 
oscillating pendulum with a deviation from the ver￾tical of θ( )t degrees and a typical period of 3 s. The 
transfer function of a typical ship is

where ωn = / 3.5 rad s and ζ = 0.3. With this low 
damping factor ζ, the oscillations continue for sev￾eral cycles, and the rolling amplitude can reach 18° 
for the expected amplitude of waves in a normal sea. 
Determine and compare the open-loop and closed￾loop system for (a) sensitivity to changes in the actuator 
constant Ka and the roll sensor K , 1 and (b) the abil￾ity to reduce the effects of step disturbances of the 
waves. Note that the desired roll s θd ( ) is zero degrees. 
(c) Find a range of K1 and Ka such that the steady-state 
tracking error reduced by 90% or more than a step dis￾turbance magnitude where Td(s) = A/s.
P4.3 One of the most important variables that must 
be controlled in industrial and chemical systems is 
temperature. A simple representation of a thermal 
control system is shown in Figure P4.3 [14]. The tem￾perature T of the process is controlled by the heater 
with a resistance R. An approximate representation 
of the dynamic linearly relates the heat loss from 
the process to the temperature difference T T − e. 
This relation holds if the temperature difference is 
relatively small and the energy storage of the heater 
and the vessel walls is negligible. It is assumed that 
E s k E E s h a b ( ) = ( ), where ka is the constant of the

P4.5 Large microwave antennas have become 
increasingly important for radio astronomy and 
satellite tracking. A large antenna with a diameter 
of 60 ft, for example, is susceptible to large wind 
gust torques. A proposed antenna is required to 
have an error of less than 20° in a 35 mph wind. 
Experiments show that this wind force exerts a 
maximum disturbance at the antenna of 200,000 ft 
lb at 35 mph, or the equivalent to 10 volts at the 
input T s d ( ) to the amplidyne. One problem of 
driving large antennas is the form of the system 
transfer function that possesses a structural reso￾nance. The antenna servosystem is shown in Figure 
P4.5. The transfer function of the antenna, drive

P4.6 An automatic speed control system will be neces￾sary for passenger cars traveling on the automatic 
highways of the future. A model of a feedback speed 
control system for a standard vehicle is shown in 
Figure P4.6. The load disturbance due to a percent 
grade T s ∆ d ( ) is also shown. The engine gain Ke
varies within the range of 10 to 1000 for various mod￾els of automobiles. The engine time constant τe is 20 
seconds. (a) Determine the sensitivity of the system 
to changes in the engine gain Ke . (b) Determine the 
effect of the load torque on the speed. (c) Determine 
the constant percent grade ∆ = T s( ) ∆ /d s d for 
which the vehicle stalls (velocity V s( ) = 0 ) in terms 
of the gain factors. Note that since the grade is con￾stant, the steady-state solution is sufficient. Assume 
that R s( ) = / 30 s km h/ r and that K Ke  1. 1 When 
K Kg/ = 2, 1 what percent grade ∆d would cause 
the automobile to stall?
P4.7 A robot uses feedback to control the orienta￾tion of each joint axis. The load effect varies due to 
varying load objects and the extended position of 
the arm. The system will be deflected by the load 
carried in the gripper. Thus, the system may be rep￾resented by Figure P4.7, where the load torque is 
T s( ) = / D s d . Assume R s( ) = 0 at the index posi￾tion. (a) What is the effect of T s d ( ) on Y s( )? (b) 
Determine the sensitivity of the closed loop to k . 2
(c) What is the steady-state error when R s( ) = /1 s

P4.8 Extreme temperature changes result in many 
failures of electronic circuits [1]. Temperature 
control feedback systems reduce the change of 
temperature by using a heater to overcome out￾door low temperatures. A block diagram of one 
system is shown in Figure P4.8. The effect of a drop 
in environmental temperature is a step decrease in 
T s d ( ). The actual temperature of the electronic 
circuit is Y s( ). The dynamics of the electronic cir￾cuit temperature change are represented by the 
transfer function.

P4.9 A useful unidirectional sensing device is the 
photoemitter sensor [15]. A light source is sensitive to 
the emitter current flowing and alters the resistance 
of the photosensor. Both the light source and the 
photoconductor are packaged in a single four-terminal 
device. This device provides a large gain and total 
isolation. A feedback circuit utilizing this device is shown 
in Figure P4.9(a), and a typical nonlinear resistance–
current characteristic is shown in Figure P4.9(b). The 
resistance curve can be represented by the equation

P4.10 For a paper processing plant, it is important to 
maintain a constant tension on the continuous sheet 
of paper between the wind-off and wind-up rolls. 
The tension varies as the widths of the rolls change, 
and an adjustment in the take-up motor speed is 
necessary, as shown in Figure P4.10. If the wind-up 
motor speed is uncontrolled, as the paper transfers 
from the wind-off roll to the wind-up roll, the ve￾locity v t 0 ( ) decreases and the tension of the paper 
drops [10, 14]. The three-roller and spring combina￾tion provides a measure of the tension of the paper. 
The spring force is equal to k Y s , 1 ( ) and the linear 
differential transformer, rectifier, and amplifier may 
be represented by E s k Y s . 0 2 ( ) = − ( ) Therefore, the

Many procedures use the retina as a laser target. 
The retina is the thin sensory tissue that rests on the 
inner surface of the back of the eye and is the actual 
transducer of the eye, converting light energy into 
electrical pulses. On occasion, this layer will detach 
from the wall, resulting in death of the detached area 
from lack of blood and leading to partial or total 
blindness in that eye. A laser can be used to “weld” 
the retina into its proper place on the inner wall.
Automated control of position enables the 
ophthalmologist to indicate to the controller where 
lesions should be inserted. The controller then 
monitors the retina and controls the laser’s position 
so that each lesion is placed at the proper location. 
A wide-angle video-camera system is required to 
monitor the movement of the retina, as shown in 
Figure DP4.4(a). If the eye moves during the ir￾radiation, the laser must be either redirected or 
turned off. The position-control system is shown 
in Figure DP4.4(b). Select an appropriate gain for 
the controller so that the transient response to a 
step change in R s( ) is satisfactory and the effect of 
the disturbance due to noise in the system is mini￾mized. Also, ensure that the steady-state error for a 
step input command is zero. Determine the largest 
value of K > 0 to ensure closed-loop stability.

DP4.7 Interest in unmanned underwater vehicles 
(UUVs) has been increasing recently, with a large 
number of possible applications being considered. 
These include intelligence-gathering, mine de￾tection, and surveillance applications. Regardless 
of the intended mission, a strong need exists for 
reliable and robust control of the vehicle. The pro￾posed vehicle is shown in Figure DP4.7 (a) [28].
We want to control the vehicle through a 
range of operating conditions. The vehicle is 30 
feet long with a vertical sail near the front. The 
control inputs are stern plane, rudder, and shaft 
speed commands. In this case, we wish to con￾trol the vehicle roll by using the stern planes.

The nominal value is used for design purposes only,

PREVIEW
The ability to adjust the transient and steady-state response of a control system is 
a beneficial outcome of the design of control systems. In this chapter, we introduce 
the time-domain performance specifications and use key input signals to test the 
response of the control system. The correlation between the system performance 
and the location of the transfer function poles and zeros is discussed. We develop 
relationships between the performance specifications and the natural frequency 
and damping ratio for second-order systems. Relying on the notion of domi￾nant poles, we can extrapolate the ideas associated with second-order systems to 
those of higher order. The concept of a performance index is also considered. We 
present a set of quantitative performance indices that adequately represent the 
performance of the control system. The chapter concludes with a performance 
analysis of the Sequential Design Example: Disk Drive Read System.
DESIRED OUTCOMES
Upon completion of Chapter 5, students should be able to:
❏ Identify key test signals used in controls and describe the resulting transient response 
characteristics of second-order systems to test signal inputs.
❏ Recognize the direct relationship between the pole locations of second-order systems 
and the transient response.
❏ Identify the design formulas that relate the second-order pole locations to percent 
overshoot, settling time, rise time, and time to peak.
❏ Explain the impact of a zero and a third pole on the second-order system response.
❏ Describe optimal control as measured with performance indices.

5.1 INTRODUCTION
The ability to adjust the transient and steady-state performance is a distinct advantage 
of feedback control systems. To analyze and design a control system, we must define 
and measure its performance. Based on the desired performance of the control sys￾tem, the controller parameters are adjusted to provide the desired response. Because 
control systems are inherently dynamic, their performance is usually specified in terms 
of both the transient response and the steady-state response. The transient response
is the response that disappears with time. The steady-state response is the response 
that exists for a long time following an input signal initiation.
The design specifications for control systems normally include several 
time-response indices for a specified input command, as well as a desired steady￾state accuracy. In the course of the design, the specifications are often revised to 
effect a compromise. Therefore, specifications are seldom a rigid set of requirements, 
but rather an attempt to quantify the desired performance. The effective compro￾mise and adjustment of specifications are graphically illustrated in Figure 5.1. The 
parameter p may minimize the performance measure M2 if we select p as a very small 
value. However, this results in large measure M1, an undesirable situation. If the per￾formance measures are equally important, the crossover point at pmin provides the 
best compromise. This type of compromise is often encountered in feedback control 
system design. It is clear that if the original specifications called for both M1 and M2
to be minimized, the specifications could not be simultaneously met; they would then 
have to be altered to allow for the compromise resulting with pmin [1, 10, 15, 20].
The specifications, which are stated in terms of the measures of performance, 
indicate the quality of the system to the designer. In other words, the performance 
measures help to answer the question, How well does the system perform the task 
for which it was designed?
5.2 TEST INPUT SIGNALS
Time-domain performance specifications are important indices because control 
systems are inherently time-domain systems. The transient response is of prime 
interest for control system designers. It is necessary to determine initially whether

the system is stable; we can achieve this goal by using the techniques of ensuing 
chapters. If the system is stable, the response to a specific input signal will provide 
several measures of the performance. However, because the actual input signal 
of the system is usually unknown, a standard test input signal is normally chosen. 
This approach is quite useful because there is a reasonable correlation between the 
response of a system to a standard test input and the system’s ability to perform 
under normal operating conditions. Furthermore, using a standard input allows the 
designer to compare several competing designs. Many control systems experience 
input signals that are very similar to the standard test signals.
The standard test input signals commonly used are the step input, the ramp input, 
and the parabolic input. These inputs are shown in Figure 5.2. The equations repre￾senting these test signals are given in Table 5.1, where the Laplace transform can be 
obtained by using Table 2.3 and a more complete list of Laplace transform pairs can 
be found at the MCS website. The ramp signal is the integral of the step input, and 
the parabola is the integral of the ramp input. A unit impulse function is also useful 
for test signal purposes. The unit impulse is based on a rectangular function

The relationship in Equation (5.2) represents the open-loop input–output relation￾ship of a system G s( ). If the input is a unit impulse function, we have

The integral has a value only at τ = 0; therefore,
y t( ) = g t( ),
the impulse response of the system G s( ). The impulse response test signal can 
often be used for a dynamic system by subjecting the system to a large-amplitude, 
narrow-width pulse of area A.
The standard test signals are of the general form
r t( ) = t n, (5.4)
and the Laplace transform is

Hence, the response to one test signal may be related to the response of another test 
signal of the form of Equation (5.4). The step input signal is the easiest to generate 
and evaluate and is usually chosen for performance tests.

5.3 PERFORMANCE OF SECOND-ORDER SYSTEMS
Let us consider a single-loop second-order system and determine its response to a 
unit step input. A closed-loop feedback control system is shown in Figure 5.3. The

where β ζ = − θ ζ = − 1 ,   cos   , 2 1 and 0 1 < <ζ . The response of this second￾order system for various values of the damping ratio ζ is shown in Figure 5.4. As 
ζ decreases, the closed-loop poles approach the imaginary axis, and the response 
becomes increasingly oscillatory.
The Laplace transform of the unit impulse is R s( ) = 1, and therefore the output

which is the derivative of the response to a step input. The impulse response of the 
second-order system is shown in Figure 5.5 for several values of the damping ratio ζ.
Standard performance measures are often defined in terms of the step response 
of the closed-loop system as shown in Figure 5.6. The swiftness of the response is 
measured by the rise time Tr and the peak time Tp. For underdamped systems with 
an overshoot, the 0–100% rise time is a useful index. If the system is overdamped, 
then the peak time is not defined, and the 10–90% rise time Tr1 is normally used.

The similarity with which the actual response matches the step input is measured 
by the percent overshoot and settling time Ts. The percent overshoot is defined as
υ
υ = − P O × M f
f
Pt . . 100% (5.12)
for a unit step input, where Mpt is the peak value of the time response, and fυ is the 
final value of the response. Normally, fυ is the magnitude of the input, but many 
systems have a final value significantly different from the desired input magnitude. 
For the system with a unit step represented by Equation (5.8), we have fυ = 1.
The settling time, Ts, is defined as the time required for the system to settle 
within a certain percentage δ of the input amplitude. This band of ±δ is shown in 
Figure 5.6. For the second-order system with closed-loop damping constant ζωn and 
a response described by Equation (5.9), we seek to determine the time Ts for which 
the response remains within 2% of the final value. This occurs approximately when
e−ζωn s T < 0.02,
or
ζωn s T ≅ 4.
Therefore, we have
τ
ζω
Ts = = n
4 4 . (5.13)
Hence, we define the settling time as four time constants (that is, τ ζ = /1 ) ωn of the 
dominant roots of the characteristic equation. The steady-state error of the system 
may be measured on the step response of the system as shown in Figure 5.6.

The transient response of the system may be described in terms of two factors:
1. The swiftness of response, as represented by the rise time and the peak time.
2. The closeness of the response to the desired response, as represented by the overshoot 
and settling time.
As it turns out, these are often contradictory requirements; thus, a compromise 
must be obtained. To obtain an explicit relation for Mpt and Tp as a function of ζ,
one can differentiate Equation (5.9) and set it equal to zero yielding
y t   e t  sin 0, n J t n  n ω
β ( ) = = ( ) ω β − ω
which is equal to zero when ω βn t n = π, where n = 0,  1,  2, ... . The first nonzero 
time this is equal to zero is when n = 1. Thus, we find that the peak time relation￾ship for this second-order system is
Tp

2 (5.14)
and the peak response is
M e pt = + − / ζπ −ζ 1 1 2
. (5.15)
Therefore, the percent overshoot is
= − / ζπ −ζ . . 100 . 1 2
P O e (5.16)
The percent overshoot versus the damping ratio, ζ, is shown in Figure 5.7. Also, 
the normalized peak time, ωn p T , is shown versus the damping ratio, ζ, in Figure 
5.7. Upon inspection of Figure 5.7, we see that we are confronted with a neces￾sary compromise between the swiftness of response and the allowable percent 
overshoot.

The step response 
for ζ = 0.2 for 
ωn = 1 and 
ωn = 10.
The swiftness of step response can be measured as the time it takes to rise from 
10% to 90% of the magnitude of the step input. This is the definition of the rise time, 
Tr1, shown in Figure 5.6. The normalized rise time, ωn r T 1, versus ζ ζ ( ) 0.05 ≤ ≤ 0.95
is shown in Figure 5.8. Although it is difficult to obtain exact analytic expressions 
for Tr1, we can utilize the linear approximation

ω = + Tr
n
(5.17)
which is accurate for 0.3 ≤ ≤ζ 0.8. This linear approximation is shown in Figure 5.8.
The swiftness of a response to a step input as described by Equation (5.17) is 
dependent on ζ and ωn. For a given ζ, the response is faster for larger ωn, as shown 
in Figure 5.9. Note that the percent overshoot is independent of ωn.
M05_DORF2374_14_GE_C05.indd 329 14/09/21 10:15 AM330 Chapter 5 The Performance of Feedback Control Systems
For a given ωn, the response is faster for lower ζ, as shown in Figure 5.10. The 
swiftness of the response, however, will be limited by the overshoot that can be 
accepted.
5.4 EFFECTS OF A THIRD POLE AND A ZERO ON THE SECOND-ORDER 
SYSTEM RESPONSE
The curves presented in Figure 5.7 are exact only for the second-order system 
of Equation (5.8). However, they provide important information because many 
systems possess a dominant pair of roots and the step response can be estimated 
by utilizing Figure 5.7. This approach, although an approximation, avoids the 
evaluation of the inverse Laplace transformation in order to determine the percent 
overshoot and other performance measures. For example, for a third-order system 
with a closed-loop transfer function
( ) ζ γ ( ) ( ) = + + +
T s
s s s
1
2 1 1 , 2 (5.18)
the s-plane diagram is shown in Figure 5.11. This third-order system is normalized 
with ωn = 1. The performance (as indicated by the percent overshoot, P.O., and the 
settling time, Ts), is adequately represented by the second-order system approxima￾tion when [4]
1 1 / ≥ γ ζ 0 . ωn
In other words, the response of a third-order system can be approximated by the 
dominant roots of the second-order system as long as the real part of the dominant 
roots is less than one tenth of the real part of the third root [15, 20].

where ωn = 1.0, ζ = 0.45, and γ = 1.0. In this case, 1 1 / ≥ γ ζ / 0 ωn. The system 
poles are at s i 1,2 = −0.45 0.89 ± and s3 = −1.0. As illustrated in Figure 5.12, the 
percent overshoot is P O. . = 10.9%, the settling time (to within 2% of the final 
value) is Ts = 8.84 s, and the rise time Tr1 = 2.16 s. Suppose that we have another
third-order system with ωn = 1.0, ζ = 0.45, and γ = 0.22. Then the system poles 
are at s i 1,2 = −0.45 0.89 ± (the same as the first system) and s3 = −4.5. In this case, 
1 1 / ≥ γ ζ0 ωn and the complex poles pair are the dominant poles. As illustrated in

respectively. In Figure 5.12, it is evident that for the third-order system satisfying 
the condition 1 1 / ≥ γ ζ0 ωn, the step response more closely matches the response of 
the second-order system, as expected.
The performance measures associated with the second-order system in 
Equation (5.10) are precise only for transfer functions without finite zeros. If the 
transfer function of a system possesses a finite zero and it is located relatively 
near the dominant complex poles, then the zero will materially affect the transient 
response of the system. In other words, the transient response of a system with one 
zero and two poles may be affected by the location of the zero [5]. Consider a sys￾tem with the system transfer function

We can investigate the response of the system compared to a second-order sys￾tem without the finite zero. Suppose that ζ = 0.45 and let a/ = ζωn 0.5,  1,  2, and 
10.0. The resulting unit step responses are shown in Figure 5.13. As the ratio a/ζωn
increases, the finite zero moves farther into the left half-plane and away from the 
poles, and the step response approaches the second-order system response, as 
expected.
The correlation of the time-domain response of a system with the s-plane 
location of the poles of the closed-loop transfer function is a key concept in under￾standing system performance in the closed-loop.

A single-loop feedback control system is shown in Figure 5.14. We need to select 
the controller gain K and the parameter p so that the time-domain specifications 
are satisfied. The transient response to a unit step is specified to have a percent 
overshoot of P O. . ≤ 5% and a settling time to within 2% of the final value of 
Ts ≤ 4 s. For second-order systems, we know the relationship in Equation (5.16) 
between percent overshoot and ζ, and the relationship in Equation (5.13) be￾tween settling time and ζωn . Solving for P O. . ≤ 5% yields ζ ≥ 0.69 and solving for 
Ts ≤ 4 s yields ζωn ≥ 1.
The region that will satisfy both time-domain requirements is shown on the 
s-plane of Figure 5.15. To meet the performance specifications, we can choose 
ζ = = 0.707  . ( ) P O. 4.3% and ζωn s = = 1 (T 4 s). Hence, the desired closed-loop 
M05_DORF2374_14_GE_C05.indd 332 14/09/21 10:15 AMpoles are r j 1 = −1 1 + and r j ˆ
1 = −1 1 − . Therefore, ζ = /1 2 and ωn = 1 2 / =ζ .

specifications will be precisely satisfied.

For the actual third-order system, we find that the P O. . = 38% and the Ts = 1.6 s. 
Thus, the effect of the third pole and zero of T s( ) cannot be neglected. This is ex￾pected since a  ζωn and τ ζ  1/ ωn. ■
The damping ratio plays a fundamental role in closed-loop system performance. 
As seen in the design formulas for settling time, percent overshoot, peak time, and 
rise time, the damping ratio is a key factor in determining the overall performance. 
In fact, for second-order systems, the damping ratio is the only factor determining 
the value of the percent overshoot to a step input. As it turns out, the damping 
ratio can be estimated from the response of a system to a step input [12]. The step 
response of a second-order system for a unit step input is given in Equation (5.9) 
yields the frequency of the damped sinusoidal term (for ζ < 1) of
  1   , 2 1 2
ω ω = − n n ( ) ζ ω = β /
and the number of cycles in 1 second is ω π /( ) 2 .
The time constant for the exponential decay is τ ζ = /1 ( ) ωn in seconds. The 
number of cycles of the damped sinusoid during one time constant is

for 0.2 ≤ ≤ζ 0.6. From the step response, you count the number of cycles visible 
up to the settling time, and use Equation (5.20) to estimate ζ,
An alternative method of estimating ζ is to determine the percent overshoot 
for the step response and use Equation (5.16) to estimate ζ.
5.5 THE s-PLANE ROOT LOCATION AND THE TRANSIENT RESPONSE
The transient response of a closed-loop feedback control system can be described in 
terms of the location of the poles of the transfer function. The closed-loop transfer 
function is written in general as
T s Y s
R s
P s s

∆ ,
M05_DORF2374_14_GE_C05.indd 335 14/09/21 10:15 AM336 Chapter 5 The Performance of Feedback Control Systems
where ∆ = ( )s 0 is the characteristic equation of the system. For a unity negative 
feedback control system the characteristic equation reduces to 1 0 + = G s c ( )G s( ) . It 
is the poles and zeros of T s( ) that determine the transient response. However, for 
a closed-loop system, the poles of T s( ) are the roots of the characteristic equation 
∆ = ( )s 0. The output of a system (with DC gain 1 = ) without repeated roots and a 
unit step input can be formulated as a partial fraction expansion as

where the A B i k ,   , and Ck are constants. The roots of the system must be either

where Dk is a constant and depends on B C k k ,   ,  αk, and ωk. The transient response 
is composed of the steady-state output, exponential terms, and damped sinusoidal 
terms. For the response to be stable—that is, bounded for a step input—the real part 
of the poles must be in the left-hand portion of the s-plane. The impulse response 
for various root locations is shown in Figure 5.17. The information imparted by the 
location of the roots is very descriptive.
It is important for the control system designer to understand the complete re￾lationship of the frequency domain representation of a linear system, the poles and 
zeros of its transfer function, and its time-domain response to step and other inputs. 
In such areas as signal processing and control, many of the analysis and design cal￾culations are done in the s-plane, where a system model is represented in terms of 
the poles and zeros of its transfer function T s( ). On the other hand, system perfor￾mance is often analyzed by examining time-domain responses, particularly when 
dealing with control systems.

The control system designer will envision the effects on the step and impulse 
responses of adding, deleting, or moving poles and zeros of T s( ) in the s-plane. 
Likewise, the designer should visualize the necessary changes for the poles and 
zeros of T s( ), in order to effect desired changes in the step and impulse responses.
An experienced designer is aware of the effects of zero locations on system 
response, as well. The poles of T s( ) determine the particular response modes 
that will be present, and the zeros of T s( ) establish the relative weightings of 
the individual mode functions. For example, moving a zero closer to a specific 
pole will reduce the relative contribution to the output response. In other words, 
the zeros have a direct impact on the values of Ai and Dk in Equation (5.22). For 
example, if there is a zero near the pole at s = −σi, then Ai will be much smaller 
in magnitude.
5.6 THE STEADY-STATE ERROR OF FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEMS
One of the fundamental reasons for using feedback, despite its cost and increased 
complexity, is the attendant improvement in the reduction of the steady-state 
error of the system. The steady-state error of a stable closed-loop system is usually 
several orders of magnitude smaller than the error of an open-loop system. The 
system actuating signal, which is a measure of the system error, is denoted as E s a( ).
Consider a unity negative feedback system. In the absence of external disturbances, 
T s d ( ) = 0, and measurement noise, N s( ) = 0, the tracking error is

It is useful to determine the steady-state error of the system for the three stan￾dard test inputs for the unity feedback system. Later in this section we will consider 
steady-state tracking errors for nonunity feedback systems.
Step Input. The steady-state error for a step input of magnitude A is therefore

It is the form of the loop transfer function G s c( )G s( ) that determines the steady￾state error. The loop transfer function is written in general form as

where ∏ denotes the product of the factors and z p i k ≠ ≠ 0,   0 for any 1 ≤ ≤i M
and i k ≤ ≤ Q. Therefore, the loop transfer function as s approaches zero depends

approaches infinity, and the steady-state error approaches zero. The number of integra￾tions is often indicated by labeling a system with a type number that is equal to N.
Consequently, for a type-zero system, N = 0, the steady-state error is

Again, the steady-state error depends upon the number of integrations, N. For a 
type-zero system, N = 0, the steady-state error is infinite. For a type-one system, 
N = 1, the error is

When the transfer function possesses two or more integrations, N ≥ 2, we obtain 
a steady-state error of zero. When N = 1, a steady-state error exists. However,

When the number of integrations equals or exceeds three, then the steady-state 
error of the system is zero.
Control systems are often described in terms of their type number and the error 
constants, K K p,   υ, and Ka. Definitions for the error constants and the steady-state 
error for the three inputs are summarized in Table 5.2.
EXAMPLE 5.3 Mobile robot steering control
A mobile robot may be designed as an assisting device or servant for a severely dis￾abled person [7]. The steering control system for such a robot can be represented 
by the block diagram shown in Figure 5.18. The steering controller is

The transient response of the vehicle to a triangular wave input when 
G s c( ) = + ( ) K s1 2 K s/ is shown in Figure 5.19. The transient response clearly shows 
the effect of the steady-state error, which may not be objectionable if Kυ is suffi￾ciently large. Note that the output attains the desired velocity as required by the 
input, but it exhibits a steady-state error. ■
The control system error constants, K K p,   υ, and Ka, describe the ability of a 
system to reduce or eliminate the steady-state error. Therefore, they are utilized as 
numerical measures of the steady-state performance. The designer determines the 
error constants for a given system and attempts to determine methods of increasing

the error constants while maintaining an acceptable transient response. In the case 
of the steering control system, we want to increase the gain factor KK2 in order to 
increase Kυ and reduce the steady-state error. However, an increase in KK2 re￾sults in an attendant decrease in the system damping ratio ζ and therefore a more 
oscillatory response to a step input. Thus, we seek a compromise that provides the 
largest Kυ based on the smallest ζ allowable.
In the preceding discussions, we assumed that we had a unity feedback system. 
Now we consider nonunity feedback systems. For a system in which the feedback 
is not unity, the units of the output Y s( ) are usually different from the output of 
the sensor. For example, a speed control system is shown in Figure 5.20. The con￾stants K1 and K2 account for the conversion of one set of units to another set of 
units (here we convert rad/s to volts). We can select K1, and thus we set K K 1 2 =
and move the block for K1 and K2 past the summing node. Then we obtain the 
equivalent block diagram shown in Figure 5.21. Thus, we obtain a unity feedback 
system as desired.
Consider a nonunity negative feedback system with the system H s( ) in the 
feedback loop given by

E s( ) = − R s( ) Y s( ) = − [1 T s( )] , R s( ) (5.35)

control system, so choosing the control as a gain with only one parameter to adjust 
is probably not practical. ■
The determination of the steady-state error is simpler for unity feedback 
systems. However, it is possible to extend the notion of error constants to nonunity 
feedback systems by first appropriately rearranging the block diagram to obtain an 
equivalent unity feedback system. Remember that the underlying system must be 
stable, otherwise our use of the final value theorem will be compromised. Consider 
the nonunity feedback system in Figure 5.21 and assume that K1 = 1. The closed￾loop transfer function is

5.7 PERFORMANCE INDICES
Modern control theory assumes that we can specify quantitatively the required 
system performance. Then a performance index can be calculated or measured 
and used to evaluate the system performance. Quantitative measures of the per￾formance of a system are very valuable in the design and operation of control 
systems.
A system is considered an optimum control system when the system parameters 
are adjusted so that the index reaches an extremum, commonly a minimum value. 
To be useful, a performance index must be a number that is always positive or zero. 
Then the best system is defined as the system that minimizes this index.
A performance index is a quantitative measure of the performance of a system 
and is chosen so that emphasis is given to the important system specifications.
A common performance index is the integral of the square of the error, ISE, 
which is defined as
∫ ISE   = ( )  .
0
2 e t dt
T
(5.37)
The upper limit T is a finite time selected by the control system designer. It is 
convenient to choose T as the settling time Ts. The step response for a specific 
feedback control system is shown in Figure 5.23(b), and the error in Figure 5.23(c). 
The error squared is shown in Figure 5.23(d), and the integral of the error squared 
in Figure 5.23(e). This criterion will discriminate between excessively overdamped 
and excessively underdamped systems. The minimum value of the integral occurs 
for a compromise value of the damping. The performance index of Equation (5.37) 
is mathematically convenient for analytical and computational purposes.
Three other performance indices we might consider include
∫ = e t( ) dt
T
IAE   , 0
(5.38)
∫ = t e( )t dt
T
ITAE   ,
0
(5.39)
and
∫ ITSE =   . ( )
0
2 te t dt
T
(5.40)
The ITAE is able to reduce the contribution of any large initial errors, as well as 
to emphasize errors occurring later in the response [6]. The performance index 
ITAE provides the best selectivity of the performance indices; that is, the min￾imum value of the integral is readily discernible as the system parameters are 
varied.
M05_DORF2374_14_GE_C05.indd 344 14/09/21 10:16 AMSection 5.7 Performance Indices 345
The general form of the performance integral is
∫ =   ( ( ),   ( ),   ( ),   )  ,

I f e t r t y t t dt
T
(5.41)
where f is a function of the error, input, output, and time. We can obtain numerous 
indices based on various combinations of the system variables and time.
EXAMPLE 5.6 Space telescope control system
Consider a space telescope pointing control system shown in Figure 5.24 [9]. We 
desire to select the magnitude of the gain, K3, to minimize the effect of the dis￾turbance, T s d ( ). The closed-loop transfer function from the disturbance to the

Therefore, the minimum ISE is obtained when K3 = = 10 3.2. This value of K3
corresponds to a damping ratio ζ = 0.50. The values of ISE and IAE for this system 
are plotted in Figure 5.25. The minimum for the IAE performance index is obtained 
when K3 = 4.2 and ζ = 0.665. While the ISE criterion is not as selective as the IAE 
criterion, it is clear that it is possible to solve analytically for the minimum value of 
ISE. The minimum of IAE is obtained by computing the actual value of IAE for 
several values of the parameter of interest. ■
A control system is optimum when the selected performance index is minimized. 
However, the optimum value of the parameters depends directly on the definition 
of optimum, that is, the performance index. Therefore, in Example 5.6, we found 
that the optimum setting varied for different performance indices.
The coefficients that will minimize the ITAE performance criterion for a step 
input have been determined for the general closed-loop transfer function [6]

This transfer function has a steady-state error equal to zero for a step input. Note 
that the transfer function has n poles and no zeros. The optimum coefficients for the 
ITAE criterion are given in Table 5.3. The responses using optimum coefficients 
for a step input are given in Figure 5.26 for ISE, IAE, and ITAE. The responses are 
provided for normalized time ωnt. Other standard forms based on different perfor￾mance indices are available and can be useful in aiding the designer to determine 
the range of coefficients for a specific problem.

This transfer function has a steady-state error equal to zero for a ramp input. The 
optimum coefficients for this transfer function are given in Table 5.4. The transfer 
function, Equation (5.50), implies that the process G s( ) has two or more pure inte￾grations, as required to provide zero steady-state error.
5.8 THE SIMPLIFICATION OF LINEAR SYSTEMS
It is quite useful to study complex systems with high-order transfer functions by 
using lower-order approximate models. Several methods are available for reduc￾ing the order of a systems transfer function. One relatively simple way to delete 
a certain insignificant pole of a transfer function is to note a pole that has a neg￾ative real part that is much more negative than the other poles. Thus, that pole is 
expected to affect the transient response insignificantly.
For example, if we have a system with transfer function

A more sophisticated approach attempts to match the frequency response of the 
reduced-order transfer function with the original transfer function frequency re￾sponse as closely as possible. Although frequency response methods are covered in 
Chapter 8, the associated approximation method strictly relies on algebraic manip￾ulation and is presented here. Consider the high-order system be described by the

frequency response very close to that of G s H( ). This is equivalent to stating that

It is interesting to see that the poles of G s H( ) are s = −1,   2 − −,   3, whereas the 
poles of G s L( ) are s = −1.024 and −1.565. Because the lower-order model has two 
poles, we estimate that we would obtain a slightly overdamped step response with a 
settling time to within 2% of the final value in approximately 3 seconds. ■
It is sometimes desirable to retain the dominant poles of the original system, 
G s H( ), in the low-order model. This can be accomplished by specifying the denom￾inator of G s L( ) to be the dominant poles of G s H( ) and allowing the numerator of 
G s L( ) to be subject to approximation.
Another novel and useful method for reducing the order is the Routh ap￾proximation method based on the idea of truncating the Routh table used to de￾termine stability. The Routh approximants can be computed by a finite recursive 
algorithm [19].
5.9 DESIGN EXAMPLES
In this section we present two illustrative examples. The first example is a simpli￾fied view of the Hubble space telescope pointing control problem. The Hubble 
space telescope problem highlights the process of computing controller gains to 
achieve desired percent overshoot specifications, as well as meeting steady-state 
error specifications. The second example considers the control of the bank angle 
of an airplane. The airplane attitude motion control example represents a more 
in-depth look at the control design problem. Here we consider a complex fourth￾order model of the lateral dynamics of the aircraft motion that is approximated by 
a second-order model using the approximation methods of Section 5.8. The simpli￾fied model can be used to gain insight into the controller design and the impact of 
key controller parameters on the transient performance.
EXAMPLE 5.8 Hubble space telescope control
The orbiting Hubble space telescope is the most complex and expensive scien￾tific instrument that has ever been built. The telescope’s 2.4 meter mirror has the

smoothest surface of any mirror made, and its pointing system can center it on a 
dime 400 miles away [18, 21]. Consider the model of the telescope-pointing system 
shown in Figure 5.27.
The goal of the design is to choose K1 and K so that (1) the percent overshoot 
of the output to a step command, r t( ), is P O. . ≤ 10%, (2) the steady-state error to 
a ramp command is minimized, and (3) the effect of a step disturbance is reduced. 
Since the system has an inner loop, block diagram reduction can be used to obtain 
the simplified system of Figure 5.27(b).

Equation (5.16) to determine that P O. . = 9.5% for ζ = 0.6. We next examine the 
steady-state error for a ramp, r t( ) = ≥ Bt,  t 0. Using Equation 5.28 we find

The steady-state error due to the ramp disturbance is reduced by increasing KK1. 
The steady-state error due to a unit step disturbance is equal to − /1 . K The steady￾state error due to the step disturbance input can thus be reduced by increasing K. In 
summary, we seek a large K and a large value of K K/ 1 to obtain low steady-state 
errors due to a step and ramp disturbance, respectively. We also require ζ = 0.6 to 
limit the percent overshoot.
With ζ = 0.6, the characteristic equation of the system is
s s + + 2 2 ζωn n ω ω = + s s ( ) 0.6 n + K. 2 2 2 (5.68)
Therefore, ωn = K, and the second term of the denominator of Equation (5.69)

EXAMPLE 5.9 Attitude control of an airplane
Each time we fly on a commercial airliner, we experience first-hand the benefits of 
automatic control systems. These systems assist pilots by improving the handling 
qualities of the aircraft over a wide range of flight conditions and by providing 
pilot relief (for such emergencies as going to the restroom) during extended flights. 
The special relationship between flight and controls began in the early work of the 
Wright brothers. Using wind tunnels, the Wright brothers applied systematic de￾sign techniques to make their dream of powered flight a reality. This systematic 
approach to design contributed to their success.
Another significant aspect of their approach was their emphasis on flight con￾trols; the brothers insisted that their aircraft be pilot-controlled. Observing birds 
control their rolling motion by twisting their wings, the Wright brothers built air￾craft with mechanical mechanisms that twisted their airplane wings. Today we no 
longer use wing warping as a mechanism for performing a roll maneuver; instead we 
control rolling motion by using ailerons, as shown in Figure 5.28. The Wright broth￾ers also used elevators (located forward) for longitudinal control (pitch motion) and 
rudders for lateral control (yaw motion). Today’s aircraft still use both elevators 
and rudders, although the elevators are generally located on the tail (rearward).
The first controlled, powered, unassisted take-off flight occurred in 1903 with 
the Wright Flyer I (a.k.a. Kitty Hawk). The first practical airplane, the Flyer III, 
could fly figure eights and stay aloft for half an hour. Three-axis flight control was a 
major (and often overlooked) contribution of the Wright brothers. A concise histor￾ical perspective is presented in Stevens and Lewis [24]. The continuing desire to fly 
faster, lighter, and longer fostered further developments in automatic flight control.
The main topic of this chapter is control of the automatic rolling motion of an 
airplane. The elements of the design process emphasized in this chapter are illus￾trated in Figure 5.29.
We begin by considering the model of the lateral dynamics of an airplane 
moving along a steady, wings-level flight path. By lateral dynamics, we mean the 
attitude motion of the aircraft about the forward velocity. An accurate mathe￾matical model describing the motion (translational and rotational) of an aircraft 
is a complicated set of highly nonlinear, time-varying, coupled differential equa￾tions. A good description of the process of developing such a mathematical model 
appears in Etkin and Reid [25].
For our purposes a simplified dynamic model is required for the autopilot de￾sign process. A simplified model might consist of a transfer function describing

the input–output relationship between the aileron deflection and the aircraft bank 
angle. Obtaining such a transfer function would require many prudent simplifica￾tions to the original high-fidelity, nonlinear mathematical model.
Suppose we have a rigid aircraft with a plane of symmetry. The airplane is as￾sumed to be cruising at subsonic or low supersonic (Mach < 3) speeds. This allows 
us to make a flat-Earth approximation. We ignore any rotor gyroscopic effects due 
to spinning masses on the aircraft (such as propellors or turbines). These assump￾tions allow us to decouple the longitudinal rotational (pitching) motion from the 
lateral rotational (rolling and yawing) motion.
Of course, we also need to consider a linearization of the nonlinear equations 
of motion. To accomplish this, we consider only steady-state flight conditions 
such as
❏ Steady, wings-level flight
❏ Steady, level turning flight
❏ Steady, symmetric pull-up
❏ Steady roll.

For this example we assume that the airplane is flying at low speed in a steady, 
wings-level attitude, and we want to design an autopilot to control the rolling 
motion. We can state the control goal as follows:
Control Goal
Regulate the airplane bank angle to zero degrees (steady, wings level) and 
maintain the wings-level orientation in the presence of unpredictable external 
disturbances.
We identify the variable to be controlled as
Variable to Be Controlled
Airplane bank angle (denoted by φ).
Defining system specifications for aircraft control is complicated, so we do not 
attempt it here. It is a subject in and of itself, and many engineers have spent 
significant efforts developing good, practical design specifications. The goal is to 
design a control system such that the dominant closed-loop system poles have 
satisfactory natural frequency and damping [24]. We must define satisfactory and 
choose test input signals on which to base our analysis.
The Cooper–Harper pilot opinion ratings provide a way to correlate the feel 
of the airplane with control design specifications [26]. These ratings address the 
handling qualities issues. Many flying qualities requirements are specified by 
government agencies, such as the United States Air Force [27]. The USAF MIL-F￾8785C is a source of time-domain control system design specifications.
For example we might design an autopilot control system for an aircraft 
in steady, wings-level flight to achieve a P O. . ≤ 20% to a step input with mini￾mal oscillatory motion and rapid response time (that is, a short time-to-peak). 
Subsequently we implement the controller in the aircraft control system and 
conduct flight tests or high-fidelity computer simulations, after which the pilots 
tell us whether they liked the performance of the aircraft. If the overall perfor￾mance was not satisfactory, we change the time-domain specification (in this case 
a percent overshoot specification) and redesign until we achieve a feel and perfor￾mance that pilots (and ultimately passengers) will accept. Despite the simplicity of 
this approach and many years of research, precise-control system design specifi￾cations that provide acceptable airplane flying characteristics in all cases are still 
not available [24].
The control design specifications given in this example may seem somewhat 
contrived. In reality the specifications would be much more involved and, in many 
ways, less precisely known. But we must begin the design process somewhere. With 
that approach in mind, we select simple design specifications and begin the iterative 
design process. The design specifications are

By making the simplifying assumptions discussed above and linearizing about 
the steady, wings-level flight condition, we can obtain a transfer function model

(5.69)
The lateral (roll/yaw) motion has three main modes: Dutch roll mode, spiral 
mode, and roll subsidence mode. The Dutch roll mode, which gets its name from 
its similarities to the motion of an ice speed skater, is characterized by a rolling and 
yawing motion. The airplane center of mass follows nearly a straightline path, and 
a rudder impulse can excite this mode. The spiral mode is characterized by a mainly 
yawing motion with some roll motion. This is a weak mode, but it can cause an air￾plane to enter a steep spiral dive. The roll subsidence motion is almost a pure roll 
motion. This is the motion we are concerned with for our autopilot design. The de￾nominator of the transfer function in Equation (5.69) shows two first-order modes 
(spiral and roll subsidence modes) and a second-order mode (Dutch roll mode).
In general the coefficients c b 0 0 ,   ,  b d 1 0 ,   ,  e f 0 0 ,   ,  f1 and the gain k are compli￾cated functions of stability derivatives. The stability derivatives are functions of 
the flight conditions and the aircraft configuration; they differ for different aircraft 
types. The coupling between the roll and yaw is included in Equation (5.69).
In the transfer function in Equation (5.69), the pole at s d = − 0 is associated 
with the spiral mode. The pole at s e = − 0 is associated with the roll subsidence 
mode. Generally, e d 0 0   .  For an F-16 flying at 500 ft/s in steady, wings-level 
flight, we have e0 = 3.57 and d0 = 0.0128 [24]. The complex conjugate poles given 
by the term s f + +s f 2 1 0 represent the Dutch roll motion.
For low angles of attack (such as with steady, wings-level flight), the Dutch 
roll mode generally cancels out of the transfer function with the s b + +s b 2 1 0 term. 
This is an approximation, but it is consistent with our other simplifying assumptions. 
Also, we can ignore the spiral mode since it is essentially a yaw motion only weakly 
coupled to the roll motion. The zero at s c = 0 represents a gravity effect that causes 
the aircraft to sideslip as it rolls. We assume that this effect is negligible, since it is 
most pronounced in a slow roll maneuver in which the sideslip is allowed to build 
up, and we assume that the aircraft sideslip is small or zero. Therefore we can sim￾plify the transfer function in Equation (5.69) to obtain a single-degree-of-freedom 
approximation:

(5.70)
For our aircraft we select e0 = 1.4 and k = 11.4. The associated time-constant of 
the roll subsidence is τ = /1 e0 = 0.7 s. These values represent a fairly fast rolling 
motion response.
For the aileron actuator model, we typically use a simple first-order system 
model,

where e s( ) = − φ φ d( )s s( ). In this case we select p = 10. This corresponds to a time 
constant of τ = /1 p = 0.1 s. This is a typical value consistent with a fast response. 
We need to have an actuator with a fast response so that the dynamics of the ac￾tively controlled airplane will be the dominant component of the system response. 
A slow actuator is akin to a time delay that can cause performance and stability 
problems.
For a high-fidelity simulation, we would need to develop an accurate model of 
the gyro dynamics. The gyro, typically an integrating gyro, is usually characterized 
by a very fast response. To remain consistent with our other simplifying assump￾tions, we ignore the gyro dynamics in the design process. This means we assume 
that the sensor measures the bank angle precisely. The gyro model is given by a 
unity transfer function,
Kg = 1. (5.72)
Thus our physical system model is given by Equations (5.70), (5.71), and (5.72).
The controller we select for this design is a proportional controller,
G s c( ) = K.
The system configuration is shown in Figure 5.30. The select key parameter is as 
follows:

We want to determine analytically the values of K that will give us the desired re￾sponse, namely, a percent overshoot less than 20% and a fast time-to-peak. The 
analytic analysis would be simpler if our closed-loop system were a second-order 
system (since we have valuable relationships between settling time, percent over￾shoot, natural frequency and damping ratio); however we have a third-order 
system, given by T s( ) in Equation (5.73). We could consider approximating the 
third-order transfer function by a second-order transfer function—this is sometimes 
a very good engineering approach to analysis. There are many methods available to

we can solve for the unknown parameters of the approximate function. The index

Comparing coefficients in Equations (5.79) and (5.80) yields
ω ζ = = K − K n 11.29 and 0.043 0.065. 2 2 (5.81)
The design specification that the percent overshoot P.O. is to be less than 20% 
implies that we want ζ ≥ 0.45. Setting ζ = 0.45 in Equation (5.81) and solving for 
K yields
K = 0.16.
With K = 0.16 we compute
ωn = = 11.29K 1.34.
Then we can estimate the time-to-peak Tp from Equation (5.14) to be

We might be tempted at this point to select ζ > 0.45 so that we reduce the 
percent overshoot even further than 20%. What happens if we decide to try this ap￾proach? From Equation (5.81) we see that K decreases as ζ increases. Then, since
ωn = 11.29K,
M05_DORF2374_14_GE_C05.indd 362 14/09/21 10:19 AMSection 5.9 Design Examples 363
as K decreases, then ωn also decreases. But the time-to-peak increases as ωn
decreases. Since our goal is to meet the specification of percent overshoot less than 
20% while minimizing the time-to-peak, we use the initial selection of ζ = 0.45 so 
that we do not increase Tp unnecessarily.
The second-order system approximation has allowed us to gain insight into the 
relationship between the parameter K and the system response, as measured by 
percent overshoot and time-to-peak. Of course, the gain K = 0.16 is only a starting 
point in the design because we in fact have a third-order system and must consider 
the effect of the third pole (which we have ignored so far).
A comparison of the third-order aircraft model in Equation (5.73) with the 
second-order approximation in Equation (5.79) for a unit step input is shown in 
Figure 5.31. The step response of the second-order system is a good approximation 
of the original system step response, so we would expect that the analytic analysis 
using the simpler second-order system to provide accurate indications of the rela￾tionship between K and the percent overshoot and time-to-peak.
With the second-order approximation, we estimate that with K = 0.16 the per￾cent overshoot is P O. . = 20% and the time-to-peak is Tp = 2.62 s. As shown in 
Figure 5.32 the percent overshoot of the original third-order system is P O. . = 20.5%
and the time-to-peak is Tp = 2.73 s. Thus, we see that that analytic analysis using 
the approximate system is an excellent predictor of the actual response. For com￾parison purposes, we select two variations in the gain and observe the response. For 
K = 0.1, the percent overshoot is P O. . = 9.5% and the time-to-peak is Tp = 3.74 s.

For  K = 0.2, the percent overshoot is P O. . = 26.5% and the time-to-peak is 
Tp = 2.38 s. So as predicted, as K decreases the damping ratio increases, leading to 
a reduction in the percent overshoot. Also as predicted, as the percent overshoot 
decreases the time-to-peak increases. ■
5.10 SYSTEM PERFORMANCE USING CONTROL DESIGN SOFTWARE
In this section, we investigate time-domain performance specifications given in terms 
of transient response to a given input signal and the resulting steady-state tracking 
errors. We conclude with a discussion of the simplification of linear systems. The 
function introduced in this section is impulse. We discuss the Isim function and see 
how these functions are used to simulate a linear system.
Time-Domain Specifications. Time-domain performance specifications are gen￾erally given in terms of the transient response of a system to a given input signal. 
Because the actual input signals are generally unknown, a standard test input signal 
is used. Consider the second-order system shown in Figure 5.3. The closed-loop

The impulse response is the time derivative of the step response. We compute the 
impulse response with the impulse function shown in Figure 5.33.
We can obtain a plot similar to that of Figure 5.4 with the step function, as 
shown in Figure 5.34. Using the impulse function, we can obtain a plot similar to 
that of Figure 5.5. The response of a second-order system for an impulse function 
input is shown in Figure 5.35. In the script, we set ωn = 1, which is equivalent to 
computing the step response versus ωnt. This gives us a more general plot valid for 
any ωn > 0.
In many cases, it may be necessary to simulate the system response to an arbi￾trary but known input. In these cases, we use the Isim function. The Isim function is 
shown in Figure 5.36.

The effect of the controller constant, K2, on the steady-state error is evident from 
Equation (5.83). Whenever K2 is large, the steady-state error is small.
We can simulate the closed-loop system response to a ramp input using the Isim 
function. The controller gains, K1 and K2, and the system gain K can be represented 
symbolically in the script so that various values can be selected and simulated. The 
results are shown in Figure 5.37 for K K 1 2 = = 1,   2 K = , and τ = /1 10. ■

5.11 SEQUENTIAL DESIGN EXAMPLE: DISK DRIVE READ SYSTEM
In this section, we further consider the design process of the disk drive read 
system. We will specify the desired performance for the system. Then we will 
attempt to adjust the amplifier gain Ka in order to obtain the best performance 
possible.
Our goal is to achieve the fastest response to a step input r t( ) while (1) limiting 
the percent overshoot and oscillatory nature of the response and (2) reducing the 
effect of a disturbance on the output position of the read head. The specifications 
are summarized in Table 5.5.
Let us consider the second-order model of the motor and arm, which neglects 
the effect of the coil inductance. We then have the closed-loop system shown in 
Figure 5.39. Then the output when T s d ( ) = 0 is

Therefore, ωn a
2 = 5 , K and 2ζωn = 20. We then determine the response of the sys￾tem as shown in Figure 5.40. Table 5.6 shows the performance measures for selected 
values of Ka.
When Ka is increased to 60, the effect of a disturbance is reduced by a factor of 2. 
We can show this by plotting the output, y t( ), as a result of a unit step disturbance

we need to select a compromise gain. In this case, we select Ka = 40 as the best 
compromise. However, this compromise does not meet all the specifications. In the 
next chapter, we consider again the design process and change the configuration of 
the control system.

5.12 SUMMARY
In this chapter, we have considered the definition and measurement of the per￾formance of a feedback control system. The concept of a performance measure or 
index was discussed, and the usefulness of standard test signals was outlined. Then, 
several performance measures for a standard step input test signal were delineated. 
For example, the overshoot, peak time, and settling time of the response of the 
system under test for a step input signal were considered. The fact that the specifi￾cations on the desired response are often contradictory was noted, and the concept 
of a design compromise was proposed. The relationship between the location of the 
s-plane root of the system transfer function and the system response was discussed. 
A most important measure of system performance is the steady-state error for spe￾cific test input signals. Thus, the relationship of the steady-state error of a system in 
terms of the system parameters was developed by utilizing the final-value theorem. 
Finally, the utility of an integral performance index was outlined, and several design 
examples that minimized a system’s performance index were completed. Thus, we 
have been concerned with the definition and usefulness of quantitative measures of 
the performance of feedback control systems.

E5.3 New passenger rail systems that could profitably 
compete with air travel are under development. Two of 
these systems, the French TGV and the Japanese Shink￾ansen, reach speeds of 160 mph [17]. The Trans-rapid, a 
magnetic levitation train, is shown in Figure E5.3(a).
The use of magnetic levitation and electro￾magnetic propulsion to provide contactless vehicle 
movement makes the Transrapid technology radically 
different. The underside of the carriage (where the 
wheel trucks would be on a conventional car) wraps 
around a guideway. Magnets are attached to the 
wraparound and pull the train to the reaction rail at 
the bottom of the guideway.
The levitation control is represented by Figure 
E5.3(b). (a) Select K so that the system provides an 
optimum ITAE response. (b) Determine the expected

The controller is a proportional plus integral control￾ler with gains Kp and KI. The objective is to design 
the controller gains such that the dominant roots 
have a damping ratio ζ equal to 0.707. Determine 
the resulting peak time and settling time (with a 2% 
criterion) of the system to a unit step input.
CDP5.1 The capstan drive system of the previous prob￾lems (see CDP1.1–CDP4.1) has a disturbance due 
to changes in the part that is being machined as 
material is removed. The controller is an amplifier 
G s c a ( ) = K . Evaluate the effect of a unit step distur￾bance, and determine the best value of the amplifier 
gain so that the percent overshoot to a step command 
r t( ) = > A t ,  0 is P O. . ≤ 5%, while reducing the ef￾fect of the disturbance as much as possible.
DP5.1 The roll control autopilot of an aircraft is shown in 
Figure DP5.1. The goal is to select a suitable K so that 
the response to a step command φ ( )t A = ≥t d ,  0, will 
provide a response φ( )t that is a fast response and has 
an percent overshoot of P O. . ≤ 20%. (a) Determine 
the closed-loop transfer function φ φ ( )s s / . d ( ) (b) 
Determine the roots of the characteristic equation 
for K = 0.7, 3, and 6. (c) Using the concept of dom￾inant roots, find the expected percent overshoot and 
peak time for the approximate second-order system. 
(d) Plot the actual response and compare with the 
approximate results of part (c). (e) Select the gain K
so that the percent overshoot is P O. . = 16%. What is 
the resulting peak time?
DP5.2 The design of the control for a welding arm with 
a long reach requires the careful selection of the 
parameters [13]. The system is shown in Figure DP5.2. 
The damping ratio ζ , the gain K, and the natural fre￾quency ωn can be selected. (a) Determine K, and 
ωn so that the response to a unit step input achieves 
Tp ≤ 1 s and P O. . ≤ 10%. (b) Plot the response of 
the system designed in part (a) to a step input.

DP5.3 Active suspension systems for modern automobiles 
provide a comfortable firm ride. The design of an ac￾tive suspension system adjusts the valves of the shock 
absorber so that the ride fits the conditions. A small 
electric motor, as shown in Figure DP5.3, changes the 
valve settings [13]. The controller is a proportional plus 
integral controller with gains KP and KI. Select a design 
value for KP, KI, and the parameter q in order to satisfy 
the ITAE performance for a step command R(s) with 
a natural frequency, ωn = 1 rad/s. Upon completion of 
your design, assuming that the complex poles dominate, 
determine the natural frequency of the system for a step 
input.

(a), uses a control system to readjust its orientation, 
as shown in Figure DP5.4 (b).
(a) Determine a second-order model for the closed￾loop system.

and the steady-state error to a step is less than

(c) Verify your design by determining the actual 
performance of the third-order system.
DP5.5 A deburring robot can be used to smooth off ma￾chined parts by following a preplanned path (input 
command signal). In practice, errors occur due to 
robot inaccuracy, machining errors, large tolerances, 
and tool wear. These errors can be eliminated using 
force feedback to modify the path online [8, 11].
While force control has been able to address 
the problem of accuracy, it has been more difficult 
to solve the contact stability problem. In fact, by 
closing the force loop and introducing a compliant 
wrist force sensor (the most common type of force 
control), one can add to the stability problem.
A model of a robot deburring system is shown 
in Figure DP5.5. Determine the region of stability 
for the system for K1 and K . 2 Assume both adjust￾able gains are greater than zero.
DP5.6 The model for a position control system using a

PREVIEW
Stability of closed-loop feedback systems is central to control system design. A stable 
system should exhibit a bounded output if the input is bounded. This is known 
as bounded-input, bounded-output stability. The stability of a feedback system 
is directly related to the location of the roots of the characteristic equation of 
the system transfer function and to the location of the eigenvalues of the system 
matrix for a system in state variable format. The Routh–Hurwitz method is intro￾duced as a useful tool for assessing system stability. The technique allows us to 
compute the number of roots of the characteristic equation in the right half plane 
without actually computing the values of the roots. This gives us a design method 
for determining values of certain system parameters that will lead to closed-loop 
stability. For stable systems, we will introduce the notion of relative stability which 
allows us to characterize the degree of stability. The chapter concludes with a sta￾bilizing controller design based on the Routh–Hurwitz method for the Sequential 
Design Example: Disk Drive Read System.

6.1 THE CONCEPT OF STABILITY
When considering the design and analysis of feedback control systems, stability is 
of the utmost importance. From a practical point of view, a closed-loop feedback 
system that is unstable is of minimal value. As with all such general statements, there 
are exceptions; but for our purposes, we will declare that all our control designs 
must result in a closed-loop stable system. Many physical systems are inherently 
open-loop unstable, and some systems are even designed to be open-loop unstable. 
Most modern fighter aircraft are open-loop unstable by design, and without active 
feedback control assisting the pilot, they cannot fly. Active control is introduced by 
engineers to stabilize the unstable system—that is, the aircraft—so that other con￾siderations, such as transient performance, can be addressed. Using feedback, we 
can stabilize unstable systems and then with a judicious selection of controller pa￾rameters, we can adjust the transient performance. For open-loop stable systems, we 
still use feedback to adjust the closed-loop performance to meet the design specifi￾cations. These specifications take the form of steady-state tracking errors, percent 
overshoot, settling time, time to peak, and the other indices.
We can say that a closed-loop feedback system is either stable or it is not stable. 
This type of stable/not stable characterization is referred to as absolute stability. 
A  system possessing absolute stability is called a stable system—the label of 
absolute is dropped. Given that a closed-loop system is stable, we can further char￾acterize the degree of stability. This is referred to as relative stability. The pioneers 
of aircraft design were familiar with the notion of relative stability—the more stable 
an aircraft was, the more difficult it was to maneuver (that is, to turn). One out￾come of the relative instability of modern acrobatic aircraft is high maneuverability. 
A acrobatic aircraft is less stable than a commercial transport; hence it can maneuver 
more quickly. As we will discuss later in this section, we can determine that a system 
is stable (in the absolute sense) by determining that all transfer function poles lie in 
the left-half s-plane, or equivalently, that all the eigenvalues of the system matrix 
A lie in the left-half s-plane. Given that all the poles (or eigenvalues) are in the 
left-half s-plane, we investigate relative-stability by examining the relative locations 
of the poles (or eigenvalues).
A stable system is defined as a system with a bounded (limited) system 
response. That is, if the system is subjected to a bounded input or disturbance and 
the response is bounded in magnitude, the system is said to be stable.
A stable system is a dynamic system with a bounded response 
to a bounded input.
The concept of stability can be illustrated by considering a right circular cone placed 
on a plane horizontal surface. If the cone is resting on its base and is tipped slightly, 
it returns to its original equilibrium position. This position and response are said to 
be stable. If the cone rests on its side and is displaced slightly, it rolls with no tendency 
to leave the position on its side. This position is designated as the neutral stability. 
M06_DORF2374_14_GE_C06.indd 395 14/09/21 10:30 AM396 Chapter 6 The Stability of Linear Feedback Systems
On the other hand, if the cone is placed on its tip and released, it falls onto its side. This 
position is said to be unstable. These three positions are illustrated in Figure 6.1.
The stability of a dynamic system is defined in a similar manner. The response 
to a displacement, or initial condition, will result in either a decreasing, neutral, or 
increasing response. Specifically, it follows from the definition of stability that a 
linear system is stable if and only if the absolute value of its impulse response g t( ),
integrated over an infinite range, is finite. That is, in terms of the convolution inte￾gral Equation (5.2) for a bounded input, 0 g t dt ∫ ( ) ∞
 must be finite.
The location in the s-plane of the poles of a system indicates the resulting transient 
response. The poles in the left-hand portion of the s-plane result in a decreasing re￾sponse for disturbance inputs. Similarly, poles on the jω-axis and in the right-hand 
plane result in a neutral and an increasing response, respectively, for a disturbance 
input. This division of the s-plane is shown in Figure 6.2. Clearly, the poles of desirable 
dynamic systems must lie in the left-hand portion of the s-plane [1–3].
A common example of the potential destabilizing effect of feedback is that 
of feedback in audio amplifier and speaker systems used for public address in 
auditoriums. In this case, a loudspeaker produces an audio signal that is an ampli￾fied version of the sounds picked up by a microphone. In addition to other audio 
inputs, the sound coming from the speaker itself may be sensed by the microphone. 
The strength of this particular signal depends upon the distance between the loud￾speaker and the microphone. Because of the attenuating properties of air, a larger 
distance will cause a weaker signal to reach the microphone. Due to the finite prop￾agation speed of sound waves, there will also be a time delay between the signal 
produced by the loudspeaker and the signal sensed by the microphone. In this case, 
the output from the feedback path is added to the external input. This is an example 
of positive feedback.
As the distance between the loudspeaker and the microphone decreases, we 
find that if the microphone is placed too close to the speaker, then the system will 
be unstable. The result of this instability is an excessive amplification and distortion 
of audio signals and an oscillatory squeal.

In terms of linear systems, we recognize that the stability requirement may be 
defined in terms of the location of the poles of the closed-loop transfer function. A 
closed-loop system transfer function can be written as

where q s( ) = ∆( )s = 0 is the characteristic equation whose roots are the poles of 
the closed-loop system. The output response for an impulse function input (when

where Ak and Bm are constants that depend on σ α k i ,  z ,   m, K, and ωm. To obtain 
a bounded response, the poles of the closed-loop system must be in the left-hand 
portion of the s-plane. Thus, a necessary and sufficient condition for a feedback 
system to be stable is that all the poles of the system transfer function have negative 
real parts. A system is stable if all the poles of the transfer function are in the left￾hand s-plane. A system is not stable if not all the roots are in the left-hand plane. If 
the characteristic equation has simple roots on the imaginary axis ( - jω axis) with all 
other roots in the left half-plane, the steady-state output will be sustained oscilla￾tions for a bounded input, unless the input is a sinusoid (which is bounded) whose 
frequency is equal to the magnitude of the jω-axis roots. For this case, the output 
becomes unbounded. Such a system is called marginally stable, since only certain 
bounded inputs (sinusoids of the frequency of the poles) will cause the output to 
become unbounded. For an unstable system, the characteristic equation has at least 
one root in the right half of the s-plane or repeated jω roots; for this case, the out￾put will become unbounded for any input.
For example, if the characteristic equation of a closed-loop system is
( ) s s + + 10 ( ) 16 = 0, 2
then the system is said to be marginally stable. If this system is excited by a sinusoid 
of frequency ω = 4, the output becomes unbounded.
An example of how mechanical resonance can cause large displacements 
occurred in a 39-story shopping mall in Seoul, Korea. The Techno-Mart build￾ing, shown in Figure 6.3, hosts activities such as physical aerobics, in addition to 
shopping. After a Tae Bo workout session on the 12th floor with about twenty 
participants, the building shook for 10 minutes triggering an evacuation for two 
days [5]. A team of experts concluded that the building was likely excited to me￾chanical resonance by the vigorous exercise.
To ascertain the stability of a feedback control system, we could determine 
the roots of the characteristic polynomial q s( ). However, we are first interested 
in determining the answer to the question, Is the system stable? If we calcu￾late the roots of the characteristic equation in order to answer this question, we 
have determined much more information than is necessary. Therefore, several 
M06_DORF2374_14_GE_C06.indd 397 14/09/21 10:30 AM398 Chapter 6 The Stability of Linear Feedback Systems
methods have been developed that provide the required yes or no answer to 
the stability question. The three approaches to the question of stability are (1) 
the s-plane approach, (2) the frequency ( ) jω approach, and (3) the time-domain 
approach.
Industrial robot sales were the highest level ever recorded for a single year in 
2013. In fact, since the introduction of industrial robots at the end of the 1960s until 
2013, there have been over 2.5 million operational industrial robots sold. The world￾wide stock of operational industrial robots at the end of 2013 was in the range of 
1.3–1.6 million units. The projections are that from 2015–2017, industrial robot in￾stallations will increase by 12% on average per year [10]. Clearly, the market for 
industrial robots is dynamic. The worldwide market for service robots is similarly 
active. The projections for the period 2014–2017 are that approximately 31 million 
new service robots for personal use (such as vacuum cleaners and lawn mowers) 
and approximately 134,500 new service robots for professional use will be put into 
service [10]. As the capability of robots increases, it is reasonable to assume that 
the numbers in service will continue to rise. Especially interesting are robots with 
human characteristics, particularly those that can walk upright [21]. The IHMC 
robot depicted in Figure 6.4 competed in the recent DARPA Robotics Challenge 
[24]. Examining the IHMC robot in Figure 6.4, one can imagine that it is not inher￾ently stable and that active control is required to keep it upright during the walking 
motion. In the next sections we present the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion to 
investigate system stability by analyzing the characteristic equation without direct 
computation of the roots.

6.2 THE ROUTH–HURWITZ STABILITY CRITERION
The discussion and determination of stability has occupied the interest of many engi￾neers. Maxwell and Vyshnegradskii first considered the question of stability of dynamic 
systems. In the late 1800s, A. Hurwitz and E. J. Routh independently published a 
method of investigating the stability of a linear system [6, 7]. The Routh–Hurwitz 
stability method provides an answer to the question of stability by considering the 
characteristic equation of the system. The characteristic equation is written as
∆ = ( )s q( )s a = + ns a n n−1s a n− + + ...   0 s a + = . 1 1 0 (6.3)
To ascertain the stability of the system, it is necessary to determine whether any one 
of the roots of q s( ) lies in the right half of the s-plane. If Equation (6.3) is written in 
factored form, we have
a s n n ( ) − − r s 1 2 ( ) r s ...( ) − = r 0, (6.4)
where r i i = th root of the characteristic equation. Multiplying the factors together, 
we find that
( ) = − ( ) + + + − q s a sn a r r r s n n n ... n 1 2 1
+ + ( ) + + − a r n r r r r r sn         ... 1 2 2 3 1 3 2
− + a r n     ( ) r r r r    r s ... n− + ... 1 2 3 1 2 4 3
+ − a r n ( ) r r r = n   1     n 1 2 3 ... 0. (6.5)

M06_DORF2374_14_GE_C06.indd 399 14/09/21 10:30 AM400 Chapter 6 The Stability of Linear Feedback Systems
In other words, for an nth-degree equation, we obtain
( ) = − − q s a sn a s n n n  (sum of all the roots) 1
+ − a s n n  (sum of the products of the roots taken 2 at a time) 2
− − a s n n  (sum of the products of the roots taken 3 at a time) 3
+ + an ( ) − = n ...   1  (product of all n roots) 0. (6.6)
Examining Equation (6.5), we note that all the coefficients of the polynomial will 
have the same sign if all the roots are in the left-hand plane. Also, it is necessary that 
all the coefficients for a stable system be nonzero. These requirements are necessary 
but not sufficient. That is, we immediately know the system is unstable if they are not 
satisfied; yet if they are satisfied, we must proceed further to ascertain the stability of 
the system. For example, when the characteristic equation is
q s( ) = + ( ) s s 2 4 ( ) − +s s = + ( ) s s + + 2 8 , 2 3 2 (6.7)
the system is unstable, and yet the polynomial possesses all positive coefficients.
The Routh–Hurwitz criterion is a necessary and sufficient criterion for 
the stability of linear systems. The method was originally developed in terms of 
determinants, but we shall use the more convenient array formulation. The Routh–
Hurwitz criterion is based on ordering the coefficients of the characteristic equation
a sn + + a s − − a s − − + + a s + = a n n n n n ... 1   0 1 2 2 1 0 (6.8)

and so on. The algorithm for calculating the entries in the array can be followed on 
a determinant basis or by using the form of the equation for bn−1.
The Routh–Hurwitz criterion states that the number of roots of q s( ) with pos￾itive real parts is equal to the number of changes in sign of the first column of the 
Routh array. This criterion requires that there be no changes in sign in the first col￾umn for a stable system. This requirement is both necessary and sufficient.
Four distinct cases or configurations of the first column array must be consid￾ered, and each must be treated separately and requires suitable modifications of the 
array calculation procedure: (1) No element in the first column is zero; (2) there is 
a zero in the first column, but some other elements of the row containing the zero 
in the first column are nonzero; (3) there is a zero in the first column, and the other 
elements of the row containing the zero are also zero; and (4) as in the third case, 
but with repeated roots on the jω-axis.
To illustrate this method clearly, several examples will be presented for each case.
Case 1. No element in the first column is zero.
EXAMPLE 6.1 Second-order system
The characteristic polynomial of a second-order system is
q s( ) = + a s2 a s + a . 2 1 0

Therefore, the requirement for a stable second-order system is that all the coeffi￾cients be positive or all the coefficients be negative. ■

For the third-order system to be stable, it is necessary and sufficient that the co￾efficients be positive and a a2 1 > a a0 3. The condition when a a2 1 = a a0 3 results in 
a marginal stability case, and one pair of roots lies on the imaginary axis in the 
s-plane. This marginal case is recognized as Case 3 because there is a zero in the first 
column when a a2 1 = a a0 3. It will be discussed under Case 3.
As a final example of characteristic equations that result in no zero elements in 
the first row, let us consider the polynomial
q s( ) = − ( ) s j 1 7 + − ( ) s j 1 7 − + ( ) s s 3 2 = + s s + + 24. 3 2 (6.9)
The polynomial satisfies all the necessary conditions because all the coefficients 
exist and are positive. Therefore, utilizing the Routh array, we have

Because two changes in sign appear in the first column, we find that two roots of 
q s( ) lie in the right-hand plane, and our prior knowledge is confirmed. ■
Case 2. There is a zero in the first column, but some other elements of the row 
containing the zero in the first column are nonzero. If only one element in the 
array is zero, it may be replaced with a small positive number, ∈, that is allowed 
to approach zero after completing the array. For example, consider the following 
characteristic polynomial:
q s( ) = + s s 2 2 + + s s 4 1 + + 1s 10. 5 4 3 2 (6.10)

When 0 1 <∈  , we find that c1 < 0 and d1 > 0. Therefore, there are two sign 
changes in the first column; hence the system is unstable with two roots in the right 
half-plane.
EXAMPLE 6.3 Unstable system
As a final example of the type of Case 2, consider the characteristic polynomial
q s( ) = + s s + + s s + K, 4 3 2 (6.11)
where we desire to determine the gain K that results in marginal stability. The

When 0 1 <∈  and K > 0, we find that c1 < 0. Therefore, there are two sign 
changes in the first column; hence, the system is unstable with two roots in the right 
half-plane. When 0 1 <∈  and K < 0, we find that c1 > 0, but because the last 
term in the first column is equal to K, we have a sign change in the first column; 
hence, the system is unstable with one root in the right half-plane. Consequently, 
the system is unstable for all values of gain K. ■
Case 3. There is a zero in the first column, and the other elements of the row 
containing the zero are also zero. Case 3 occurs when all the elements in one row 
are zero or when the row consists of a single element that is zero. This condition 
occurs when the polynomial contains singularities that are symmetrically located 
about the origin of the s-plane. Therefore, Case 3 occurs when factors such as 
( ) s s + − σ σ ( ) or ( ) s j + − ω ω ( ) s j occur. This problem is circumvented by utilizing 
the auxiliary polynomial, U s( ), which immediately precedes the zero entry in the 
Routh array. The order of the auxiliary polynomial is always even and indicates the 
number of symmetrical root pairs.
To illustrate this approach, let us consider a third-order system with the charac￾teristic polynomial
q s( ) = + s s 2 4 + +s K, 3 2 (6.12)

For a stable system, we require that
0 8 < < K .
When K = 8, we have two roots on the jω-axis and a marginal stability case. Note 
that we obtain a row of zeros (Case 3) when K = 8. The auxiliary polynomial, U s( ), 
is the equation of the row preceding the row of zeros. The equation of the row preced￾ing the row of zeros is, in this case, obtained from the s -row. 2 We recall that this row 
contains the coefficients of the even powers of s, and therefore we have
U s( ) = + 2 2 s Ks s = + 8 2 = + ( ) s s 4 2 = + ( ) j s 2 2 ( ) − j . 2 0 2 2 (6.13)
When K = 8, the factors of the characteristic polynomial are
q s( ) = + ( ) s s 2 2 ( ) + − j s( ) j2 . (6.14)
Case 4. Repeated roots of the characteristic equation on the j - ω axis. If the 
jω-axis roots of the characteristic equation are simple, the system is neither stable 
nor unstable; it is instead called marginally stable, since it has an undamped 
sinusoidal mode. If the jω-axis roots are repeated, the system response will be 
unstable with a form t t  sin( ) ω φ + . The Routh–Hurwitz criteria will not reveal this 
form of instability [20].
Consider the system with a characteristic polynomial

where s s = /ωn. * In this case, b = 2.5 and c = 0.5. Using this normalized form of the 
characteristic equation, we summarize the stability criterion for up to a sixth-order 
characteristic equation, as provided in Table 6.1. Note that bc = 1.25 and the system 
is stable.
6.3 THE RELATIVE STABILITY OF FEEDBACK CONTROL SYSTEMS
The verification of stability using the Routh–Hurwitz criterion provides only a 
partial answer to the question of stability. The Routh–Hurwitz criterion ascertains 
the absolute stability of a system by determining whether any of the roots of the 
characteristic equation lie in the right half of the s-plane. However, if the system 
satisfies the Routh–Hurwitz criterion and is stable, it is desirable to determine the 
relative stability; that is, it is interesting to investigate the relative damping of each 
root of the characteristic equation. The relative stability of a system can be defined 
as the property that is measured by the relative real part of each root or pair of 
roots. Thus, root r2 is relatively more stable than the roots r r 1 1 ,  ˆ , as shown in Figure 
6.6. The relative stability of a system can also be defined in terms of the relative 
damping coefficients ζ of each complex root pair and, therefore, in terms of the 
speed of response and overshoot instead of settling time.
The investigation of the relative stability of each root is important because the 
location of the closed-loop poles in the s-plane determines the performance of the 
system. Thus, we reexamine the characteristic polynomial q s( ) and consider several 
methods for the determination of relative stability.

M06_DORF2374_14_GE_C06.indd 407 14/09/21 10:30 AM408 Chapter 6 The Stability of Linear Feedback Systems
Because the relative stability of a system is determined by the location of the 
roots of the characteristic equation, a first approach using an s-plane formulation 
is to extend the Routh–Hurwitz criterion to ascertain relative stability. This can be 
accomplished by utilizing a change of variable, which shifts the s-plane axis in order 
to utilize the Routh–Hurwitz criterion. Examining Figure 6.6, we notice that a shift 
of the vertical axis in the s-plane to −σ1 will result in the roots r r ,  ˆ 1 1 appearing on 
the shifted axis. The correct magnitude to shift the vertical axis must be obtained 
on a trial-and-error basis. Then, without solving the fifth-order polynomial q s( ), we 
may determine the real part of the dominant roots r r 1 1 ,  ˆ .
EXAMPLE 6.6 Axis shift
Consider the third-order characteristic equation
q s( ) = + s s 4 6 + +s 4. 3 2 (6.17)
Setting the shifted variable sn equal to s + 1, we obtain
1 4 1 6 1 4 1. 3 2 3 2 ( ) s s n n − + ( ) − + ( ) s s n n − + = + s s n n + + (6.18)

1 1 1 . U s 2 ( ) n n = + s s = + ( ) n n j s( ) − = j s( ) + + j s( ) + − j (6.19) ■
The shifting of the s-plane axis to ascertain the relative stability of a system is 
a very useful approach, particularly for higher-order systems with several pairs of 
closed-loop complex conjugate roots.
6.4 THE STABILITY OF STATE VARIABLE SYSTEMS
The stability of a system modeled by a state variable flow graph model can be read￾ily ascertained. If the system we are investigating is represented by a signal-flow 
graph state model, we obtain the characteristic equation by evaluating the flow 
graph determinant. If the system is represented by a block diagram model we ob￾tain the characteristic equation using the block diagram reduction methods.
EXAMPLE 6.7 Stability of a second-order system
A second-order system is described by the two first-order differential equations
x x   1 1 = −3   + = x x 2 2 and 1 + − x K 2 1x K + u, (6.20)
M06_DORF2374_14_GE_C06.indd 408 14/09/21 10:30 AMSection 6.4 The Stability of State Variable Systems 409
where u t( ) is the input. The flow graph model of this set of differential equations is 
shown in Figure 6.7(a) and the block diagram model is shown in Figure 6.7(b).
Using Mason’s signal-flow gain formula, we note three loops:
L s = = − − L s − = L K− − 1 ,   3 ,   and s , 1 2 1 3 2
where L1 and L2 do not share a common node. Therefore, the determinant is
∆ = − + ( ) + + = −( ) − − + −( ) L L L L L s− − − − 1 1 1 2 3 1 2 3 3 s Ks s . 1 1 2 2
We multiply by s2 to obtain the characteristic equation
s s + + 2 3 ( ) K − = 0. 2
Since all coefficients must be positive, we require K > 3 for stability. A similar 
analysis can be undertaken using the block diagram. Closing the two feedback loops 
yields the two transfer functions

∆ = ( )s s( ) − + 1 3 ( ) s K + = s s + + 2 3 ( ) K − = 0. 2 (6.21)
This confirms the results obtained using signal-flow graph techniques. ■
A method of obtaining the characteristic equation directly from the vector dif￾ferential equation is based on the fact that the solution to the unforced system is an 
exponential function. The vector differential equation without input signals is
x A  = x, (6.22)
where x is the state vector. The solution is of exponential form, and we can define 
a constant λ such that the solution of the system for one state can be of the form 
x t k e . i i ti ( ) = λ The λi are called the characteristic roots or eigenvalues of the system, 
which are simply the roots of the characteristic equation. If we let x k = λe t
 and sub￾stitute into Equation (6.22), we have
λk A = k λ λ e e t t , (6.23)
or
λx A = x. (6.24)
 Equation (6.24) can be rewritten as
( ) λI A − =x 0, (6.25)
where I equals the identity matrix and 0 equals the null matrix. This set of simulta￾neous equations has a nontrivial solution if and only if the determinant vanishes—
that is, only if
det(λI A − =) 0. (6.26)
The nth-order equation in λ resulting from the evaluation of this determinant is the 
characteristic equation, and the stability of the system can be readily ascertained.

Thus, we obtain the characteristic equation of the system. The additional root λ = 0
results from the definition of x3 as the integral of α γ x x 1 2 + , and x3 does not affect 
the other state variables. Thus, the root λ = 0 indicates the integration connected 
with x3. The characteristic equation indicates that the system is marginally stable 
when α γ + > 0 and αγ + > β   0. 2 ■
6.5 DESIGN EXAMPLES
In this section we present two illustrative examples. The first example is a tracked 
vehicle control problem. In this first example, stability issues are addressed em￾ploying the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion and the outcome is the selection of 
two key system parameters. The second example illustrates the stability problem 
robot-controlled motorcycle and how Routh–Hurwitz can be used in the selection 
of controller gains during the design process. The robot-controlled motorcycle 
example highlights the design process with special attention to the impact of key 
controller parameters on stability.
EXAMPLE 6.9 Tracked vehicle turning control
The design of a turning control for a tracked vehicle involves the selection of two 
parameters [8]. In Figure 6.8, the system shown in part (a) has the model shown in 
part (b). The two tracks are operated at different speeds in order to turn the vehicle. 
We must select K and a so that the system is stable and the steady-state error for a 
ramp command is less than or equal to 24% of the magnitude of the command.

Since our focus here is on stability rather than transient response characteristics, the 
control specifications will be related to stability only; transient performance is an 
issue that we need to address once we have investigated all the stability issues. The 
control design specification is
Design Specification
DS1 The closed-loop system must be stable.
The main components of the robot-controlled motorcycle are the motorcycle and 
robot, the controller, and the feedback measurements. The main subject of the chapter 
is not modeling, so we do not concentrate on developing the motorcycle dynamics 
model. We rely instead on the work of others (see [22]). The motorcycle model is 
given by

The forward speed of the motorcycle is denoted by υ, and c denotes the wheel￾base (the distance between the wheel centers). The length, L, is the horizontal 
distance between the front wheel axle and the motorcycle center of gravity. The 
time-constant of the controller is denoted by τ. This term represents the speed of 
response of the controller; smaller values of τ indicate an increased speed of re￾sponse. Many simplifying assumptions are necessary to obtain the simple transfer 
function models in Equations (6.31) and (6.32).
Control is accomplished by turning the handlebar. The front wheel rotation 
about the vertical is not evident in the transfer functions. Also, the transfer func￾tions assume a constant forward speed υ which means that we must have another 
control system at work regulating the forward speed. Nominal motorcycle and 
robot controller parameters are given in Table 6.2.
Assembling the components of the feedback system gives us the system 
configuration shown in Figure 6.12. Examination of the configuration reveals that 
the robot controller block is a function of the physical system (h, c, and L), the 
operating conditions ( ) υ , and the robot time-constant ( ) τ . No parameters need 
adjustment unless we physically change the motorcycle parameters and/or speed. 
In fact, in this example the parameters we want to adjust are in the feedback loop:
Select Key Tuning Parameters
Feedback gains KP and KD.
The key tuning parameters are not always in the forward path; in fact they may exist 
in any subsystem in the block diagram.
We want to use the Routh–Hurwitz technique to analyze the closed-loop sys￾tem stability. What values of KP and KD lead to closed-loop stability? A related 
question that we can pose is, given specific values of KP and KD for the nominal 
system (that is, nominal values of α α 1 2 ,   ,  α3, and τ), how can the parameters them￾selves vary while still retaining closed-loop stability?

The question that we need to answer is for what values of KP and KD does the char￾acteristic equation ∆ = ( )s 0 have all roots in the left half-plane?

By inspecting column 1, we determine that for stability we require
τ α > > 0,   1 K K D P − / 3 1 ,   > / α α2,  and a > 0.
Choosing KD > 0 satisfies the second inequality (note that α3 > 0). In the event 
τ = 0, we would reformulate the characteristic equation and rework the Routh 
array. We need to determine the conditions on KP and KD such that a > 0. We find 
that a > 0 implies that the following relationship must be satisfied:

Using the nominal values of the parameters α α 1 2 ,   ,  α3, and τ (see Table 6.2), for 
all KD > 0 and KP > 3.33, the left hand-side of Equation (6.33) is positive, hence 
a > 0. Taking into account all the inequalities, a valid region for selecting the gains 
is KD > 0 and KP > / α α1 2 = 3.33.

Selecting any point ( , K K P D   ) in the stability region yields a valid (that is, stable) 
set of gains for the feedback loop. For example, selecting
K K P D = = 10 and  5
yields a stable closed-loop system. The closed-loop poles are
s s 1 2 = −35.2477,   = −2.4674,  and s3 = −1.0348.
Since all the poles have negative real parts, we know the system response to any 
bounded input will be bounded.
For this robot-controlled motorcycle, we do not expect to have to respond to 
nonzero command inputs (that is, φd ( )t ≠ 0) since we want the motorcyle to remain up￾right, and we certainly want to remain upright in the presence of external disturbances. 
The transfer function for the disturbance T s d ( ) to the output φ( )s without feedback is

The characteristic equation is
q s( ) = − s α = 0. 2 1
The system poles are
s1 1 = − α α  and s . 2 1 = +
Thus we see that the motorcycle is unstable; it possesses a pole in the right 
half-plane. Without feedback control, any external disturbance will result in the 
motorcycle falling over. Clearly the need for a control system (usually provided by 
the human rider) is necessary. With the feedback and robot controller in the loop, 
the closed-loop transfer function from the disturbance to the output is

The response to a step disturbance is shown in Figure 6.13; the response is stable. 
The control system manages to keep the motorcycle upright, although it is tilted at 
about φ = = 0.055 rad 3.18 deg.
It is important to give the robot the ability to control the motorcycle over a 
wide range of forward speeds. Is it possible for the robot, with the feedback gains 
as selected (KP = 10 and KD = 5), to control the motorcycle as the velocity varies? 
From experience we know that at slower speeds a bicycle becomes more difficult 
to control. We expect to see the same characteristics in the stability analysis of our 
system. Whenever possible, we try to relate the engineering problem at hand to 
real-life experiences. This helps to develop intuition that can be used as a reason￾ableness check on our solution.
A plot of the roots of the characteristic equation as the forward speed υ var￾ies is shown in Figure 6.14. The data in the plot were generated using the nominal 
values of the feedback gains, KP = 10 and KD = 5. We selected these gains for 
the case where υ = / 2 m s. Figure 6.14 shows that as υ increases, the roots of the

is positive, the motorcycle is unstable. ■

6.6 SYSTEM STABILITY USING CONTROL DESIGN SOFTWARE
In this section we will see how the computer can assist us in the stability analysis by 
providing an easy and accurate method for computing the poles of the characteristic 
equation. For the case of the characteristic equation as a function of a single param￾eter, it will be possible to generate a plot displaying the movement of the poles as 
the parameter varies. The section concludes with an example.
The function introduced in this section is the function for, which is used to re￾peat a number of statements a specific number of times.
Routh–Hurwitz Stability. As stated earlier, the Routh–Hurwitz criterion is a nec￾essary and sufficient criterion for stability. Given a characteristic equation with 
fixed coefficients, we can use Routh–Hurwitz to determine the number of roots in 
the right half-plane. For example, consider the characteristic equation
q s( ) = + s s 3 2 + + 2 2 s 4 0 =
associated with the closed-loop control system shown in Figure 6.15. The corre￾sponding Routh–Hurwitz array is shown in Figure 6.16. The two sign changes in 
the first column indicate that there are two roots of the characteristic polynomial 
in the right half-plane; hence, the closed-loop system is unstable. We can verify the 
Routh–Hurwitz result by directly computing the roots of the characteristic equation, 
as shown in Figure 6.17, using the pole function. Recall that the pole function com￾putes the system poles.
Whenever the characteristic equation is a function of a single parameter, the 
Routh–Hurwitz method can be utilized to determine the range of values that the 
parameter may take while maintaining stability. Consider the closed-loop feedback 
system in Figure 6.18. The characteristic equation is
q s( ) = + s s 2 4 ++= s K 0. 3 2
Using a Routh–Hurwitz approach, we find that we require 0 8 < < K for stability (see 
Equation 6.12). We can verify this result graphically. As shown in Figure 6.19(b), we

establish a vector of values for K at which we wish to compute the roots of the charac￾teristic equation. Then using the roots function, we calculate and plot the roots of the 
characteristic equation, as shown in Figure 6.19(a). It can be seen that as K increases, 
the roots of the characteristic equation move toward the right half-plane as the gain 
tends toward K = 8, and eventually into the right half-plane when K > 8.
The script in Figure 6.19 contains the for function. This function provides a 
mechanism for repeatedly executing a series of statements a given number of times. 
The for function connected to an end statement sets up a repeating calculation loop. 
Figure 6.20 describes the for function format and provides an illustrative example 
of its usefulness. The example sets up a loop that repeats ten times. During the ith 
iteration, where 1 1 ≤ ≤i 0, the ith element of the vector a is set equal to 20, and the 
scalar b is recomputed.
The Routh–Hurwitz method allows us to make definitive statements regard￾ing absolute stability of a linear system. The method does not address the issue of 
relative stability, which is directly related to the location of the roots of the charac￾teristic equation. Routh–Hurwitz tells us how many poles lie in the right half-plane, 
but not the specific location of the poles. With control design software, we can easily 
calculate the poles explicitly, thus allowing us to comment on the relative stability.
EXAMPLE 6.11 Tracked vehicle control
The block diagram of the control system for the two-track vehicle is shown in 
Figure 6.8. The design objective is to find a and K such that the system is stable and 
the steady-state error for a ramp input is less than or equal to 24% of the command.
We can use the Routh–Hurwitz method to aid in the search for appropriate 
values of a and K. The closed-loop characteristic equation is
q s( ) = + s s 8 1 + + 7 1 s K( ) + + 0 0 s aK = . 4 3 2
Using the Routh array, we find that, for stability, we require that

For positive K, it follows that we can restrict our search to 0 < < K 126 and a > 0.
Our approach will be to use the computer to help find a parameterized a versus K
region in which stability is assured. Then we can find a set of (a, K) belonging to the 
stable region such that the steady-state error specification is met. This procedure, 
shown in Figure 6.21, involves selecting a range of values for a and K and computing 
the roots of the characteristic polynomial for specific values of a and K. For each 
value of K, we find the first value of a that results in at least one root of the char￾acteristic equation in the right half-plane. The process is repeated until the entire 
selected range of a and K is exhausted. The plot of the (a, K) pairs defines the sepa￾ration between the stable and unstable regions. The region to the left of the plot of 
a versus K in Figure 6.21 is the stable region.

(6.34) will lead to an acceptable design. For example, K = 70 and a = 0.6 will sat￾isfy all the design requirements. The closed-loop transfer function (with a = 0.6

The Stability of State Variable Systems. Now let us turn to determining the 
stability of systems described in state variable form. Suppose we have a system in 
state-space form as in Equation (6.22). The stability of the system can be evaluated 
with the characteristic equation associated with the system matrix A. The charac￾teristic equation is
det(sI A − =) 0. (6.35)
The left-hand side of the characteristic equation is a polynomial in s. If all of the 
roots of the characteristic equation have negative real parts (i.e., Re( ) si < 0), then 
the system is stable.
When the system model is given in state variable form, we must calculate the 
characteristic polynomial associated with the A matrix. In this regard, we have sev￾eral options. We can calculate the characteristic equation directly from Equation 
(6.35) by manually computing the determinant of sI A − . Then, we can compute 
the roots using the roots function to check for stability, or alternatively, we can use 
the Routh–Hurwitz method to detect any unstable roots. Unfortunately, the man￾ual computations can become lengthy, especially if the dimension of A is large. We 
would like to avoid this manual computation if possible. As it turns out, the com￾puter can assist in this endeavor.
The poly function can be used to compute the characteristic equation associ￾ated with A. The poly is used to form a polynomial from a vector of roots. It can 
also be used to compute the characteristic equation of A, as illustrated in Figure 
6.23. The input matrix A is

6.8 SUMMARY
In this chapter, we have considered the concept of the stability of a feedback control 
system. A definition of a stable system in terms of a bounded system response was out￾lined and related to the location of the poles of the system transfer function in the s-plane.
M06_DORF2374_14_GE_C06.indd 427 14/09/21 10:31 AM428 Chapter 6 The Stability of Linear Feedback Systems
The Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion was introduced, and several examples 
were considered. The relative stability of a feedback control system was also consid￾ered in terms of the location of the poles and zeros of the system transfer function in 
the s-plane. The stability of state variable systems was considered.

and the feedback transfer function is H s( ) = /1
(s + 50). (a) Determine the limiting value of gain K
for a stable system. (b) For the gain that results in 
marginal stability, determine the magnitude of the 
imaginary roots. (c) Reduce the gain to one-third of 
the magnitude of the marginal value, and determine 
the relative stability of the system (1) by shifting the 
axis and using the Routh–Hurwitz criterion and (2) 
by determining the root locations. Show the roots are 
between −4 and −5.
P6.5 Determine the relative stability of the systems with 
the following characteristic equations (1) by shifting 
the axis in the s-plane and using the Routh–Hurwitz 
criterion, and (2) by determining the location of the 
complex roots in the s-plane:

Figure P6.6. Determine the stability of the system 
P6.2 An antenna control system was analyzed in 
Problem P4.5, and it was determined that, to reduce 
the effect of wind disturbances, the gain of the mag￾netic amplifier, ka, should be as large as possible. (a) 
Determine the limiting value of gain for maintaining 
a stable system. (b) We want to have a system settling 
time equal to 1.5 seconds. Using a shifted axis and the 
Routh–Hurwitz criterion, determine the value of 
the  gain that satisfies this requirement. Assume 
that the complex roots of the closed-loop system 
dominate the transient response. (Is this a valid ap￾proximation in this case?)
P6.3 Arc welding is one of the most important areas 
of application for industrial robots [11]. In most 
manufacturing welding situations, uncertainties in 
dimensions of the part, geometry of the joint, and 
the welding process itself require the use of sensors 
for maintaining weld quality. Several systems use a 
vision system to measure the geometry of the puddle 
of melted metal, as shown in Figure P6.3. This system 
uses a constant rate of feeding the wire to be melted. 
(a) Calculate the maximum value for K for the sys￾tem that will result in a stable system. (b) For half of 
the maximum value of K found in part (a), determine 
the roots of the characteristic equation. (c) Estimate 
the overshoot of the system of part (b) when it is 
subjected to a step input.

P6.7 The linear model of a phase detector (phase-lock 
loop) can be represented by Figure P6.7 [9]. The 
phase-lock systems are designed to maintain zero dif￾ference in phase between the input carrier signal and

determine the location of the roots of the system.
P6.8 A very interesting and useful velocity control 
system has been designed for a wheelchair control 
system. A proposed system utilizing velocity sensors 
mounted in a headgear is shown in Figure P6.8. The 
headgear sensor provides an output proportional 
to the magnitude of the head movement. There is a 
sensor mounted at 90° intervals so that forward, left, 
right, or reverse can be commanded. Typical values 
for the time constants are τ τ = = 0.5 s,  1 s, 1 2 and 
1 4  s. τ3 =
(a) Determine the limiting gain K K = 1 2 K K3 for a 
stable system.
(b) When the gain K is set equal to one-third of the 
limiting value, determine whether the settling 
time (to within 2% of the final value of the sys￾tem) is Ts ≤ 4 s.
(c) Determine the value of gain that results in a sys￾tem with a settling time of Ts ≤ 4 s. Also, obtain 
the value of the roots of the characteristic equa￾tion when the settling time is Ts ≤ 4 s.

P6.17 The elevator in Yokohama’s 70-story Landmark 
Tower operates at a peak speed of 45 km/hr. To reach 
such a speed without inducing discomfort in pas￾sengers, the elevator accelerates for longer periods, 
rather than more precipitously. Going up, it reaches 
full speed only at the 27th floor; it begins decelerat￾ing 15  floors later. The result is a peak acceleration 
similar to that of other skyscraper elevators—a bit 
less than a tenth of the force of gravity. Admirable 
ingenuity has gone into making this safe and com￾fortable. Special ceramic brakes had to be developed; 
iron ones would melt. Computer-controlled systems 
damp out vibrations. The lift has been streamlined to 
reduce the wind noise as it speeds up and down [19]. 
One proposed control system for the elevator verti￾cal position is shown in Figure P6.17. Determine the 
range of K for a stable system, where K > 0.

P6.11 A feedback control system has a characteristic 
equation

The parameter K must be positive. What is the maxi￾mum value K can assume before the system becomes 
unstable? When K is equal to the maximum value, 
the system oscillates. Determine the frequency of 
oscillation.
P6.12 A system has the third-order characteristic equation
s a + + s bs c + = 0, 3 2
where a, b, and c are constant parameters. Determine 
the necessary and sufficient conditions for the system 
to be stable. Is it possible to determine stability of the 
system by just inspecting the coefficients of the char￾acteristic equation?
P6.13 Consider the system in Figure P6.13. Determine 
the conditions on K, p, and z that must be satisfied 
for closed-loop stability. Assume that K > 0, ζ > 0,

AP6.1 A teleoperated control system incorporates both

to the machine and limited feedback to the operator. 
However, two-way coupling using bilateral informa￾tion exchange enables better operation [18]. In the 
case of remote control of a robot, force feedback plus

AP6.2 Consider the case of a navy pilot landing an air￾craft on an aircraft carrier. The pilot has three basic 
tasks. The first task is guiding the aircraft’s approach

The extender is worn by the human; the physical 
contact between the extender and the human allows 
the direct transfer of mechanical power and informa￾tion signals. Because of this unique interface, control 
of the extender trajectory can be accomplished with￾out any type of joystick or keyboard. The human 
provides a control system for the extender, while 
the extender actuators provide most of the strength 
necessary for the task. The human becomes a part 
of the extender and “feels” a scaled-down version of 
the load that the extender is carrying. An extender 
is shown in Figure AP6.7(a) [23]. The block diagram 
of the system is shown in Figure AP6.7(b). Consider 
the proportional plus derivative controller
G s( ) = + K K s c p D .
Determine the range of values of the controller gains
KP and KD such that the closed-loop system is stable.
A proportional plus derivative controller is used in a 
system as shown in Figure AP6.6(b), where
G s K K s, c p ( ) = + D
and where Kp > 0 and KD > 0. Obtain and plot the 
relationship between Kp and KD that results in a sta￾ble closed-loop system.
AP6.7 A human’s ability to perform physical tasks is 
limited not by intellect but by physical strength. If, 
in an appropriate environment, a machine’s mechan￾ical power is closely integrated with a human arm’s 
mechanical strength under the control of the human 
intellect, the resulting system will be superior to a 
loosely integrated combination of a human and a fully 
automated robot.
Extenders are defined as a class of robot ma￾nipulators that extend the strength of the human 
arm while maintaining human control of the task 
[23]. The defining characteristic of an extender is the 
transmission of both power and information signals.

PREVIEW
The performance of a feedback system can be described in terms of the location 
of the roots of the characteristic equation in the s-plane. A graph showing how the 
roots of the characteristic equation move around the s-plane as a single parameter 
varies is known as a root locus plot. The root locus is a powerful tool for design￾ing and analyzing feedback control systems. We will discuss practical techniques 
for obtaining a sketch of a root locus plot. We also consider computer-generated 
root locus plots and illustrate their effectiveness in the design process. We show 
that it is possible to use root locus methods for controller design when more than 
one parameter varies. This is important because we know that the response of a 
closed-loop feedback system can be adjusted to achieve the desired performance 
by judicious selection of one or more controller parameters. The popular PID con￾troller is introduced as a practical controller structure. We also define a measure of 
sensitivity of a specified root to a small incremental change in a system parameter. 
The chapter concludes with a controller design based on root locus methods for the 
Sequential Design Example: Disk Drive Read System.

7.1 INTRODUCTION
The relative stability and the transient performance of a closed-loop control sys￾tem are directly related to the location of the closed-loop roots of the characteristic 
equation in the s-plane. It is frequently necessary to adjust one or more system 
parameters in order to obtain suitable root locations. Therefore, it is worthwhile to 
determine how the roots of the characteristic equation of a given system migrate 
about the s-plane as the parameters are varied; that is, it is useful to determine the 
locus of roots in the s-plane as a parameter is varied. The root locus method was in￾troduced by Evans in 1948 and has been developed and utilized extensively in con￾trol engineering practice [1–3]. The root locus technique is a graphical method for 
sketching the locus of roots in the s-plane as a parameter is varied. The root locus 
method provides the engineer with a measure of the sensitivity of the roots of the 
system to a variation in the parameter being considered. The root locus technique 
may be used to great advantage in conjunction with the Routh–Hurwitz criterion.
The root locus method provides graphical information, and therefore an 
approximate sketch can be used to obtain qualitative information concerning the 
stability and performance of the system. Furthermore, the locus of roots of the 
characteristic equation of a multiloop system may be investigated as readily as for a 
single-loop system. If the root locations are not satisfactory, the necessary parameter 
adjustments often can be readily ascertained from the root locus [4].
7.2 THE ROOT LOCUS CONCEPT

closed-loop transfer function
T s , Y s

( ) ( )
( )
( )
( ) = = (7.1)
where p(s) and q(s) are polynomials in s. The roots of the characteristic equa￾tion q(s) determine the modes of response of the system. In the case of the simple 
single-loop system shown in Figure 7.1, we have the characteristic equation
1 0 + = KG( )s , (7.2)
where K is a variable parameter and 0 ≤ < K ∞. The characteristic roots of the 
system must satisfy Equation (7.2), where the roots lie in the s-plane. Because s is a 
complex variable, Equation (7.2) may be rewritten in polar form as
KG( )s KG s( ) = −1 0 + j , (7.3)

and therefore it is necessary that

The root locus is the path of the roots of the characteristic equation traced 
out in the s-plane as a system parameter varies from zero to infinity.
Consider the second-order system shown in Figure 7.2. The characteristic 
equation is

or, alternatively,
2 2 0. 2 2 2 ∆ = ( )s s + +s K = + s s ζωn n + = ω (7.5)
The locus of the roots as the gain K is varied is found by requiring that
( ) ( ) = + = 2
KG s   1 K

(7.6)
and
KG( )s = ±180°,   ± 540°,  . . . . (7.7)
The gain K is varied from zero to infinity. For a second-order system, the roots are
s s 1 2 ,   = −ζωn n ± − ω ζ 1, 2 (7.8)
and for ζ < 1, we know that θ ζ = − cos   . 1 Graphically, for two open-loop poles as 
shown in Figure 7.3, the locus of roots is a vertical line for ζ ≤ 1 in order to satisfy 
the angle requirement, Equation (7.7). For example, as shown in Figure 7.4, at a 
root s1, the angles are
θ θ ( ) ( ) ( ) + = − − + = − − + = −

This angle requirement is satisfied at any point on the vertical line that is a perpen￾dicular bisector of the line 0 to −2. Furthermore, the gain K at the particular points

where Ln equals the value of the nth self-loop transmittance. Hence, we have a 
characteristic equation, which may be written as
q s( ) = ∆( )s F = +1 . ( )s (7.13)
To find the roots of the characteristic equation, we set Equation (7.13) equal to zero 
and obtain
1 0 + = F s( ) . (7.14)
Equation (7.14) may be rewritten as
F s( ) = −1 0 + j , (7.15)
and the roots of the characteristic equation must also satisfy this relation.

where k is an integer. The magnitude requirement in Equation (7.16) enables us to 
determine the value of K for a given root location s1. A test point in the s-plane, s1,
is verified as a root location when Equation (7.17) is satisfied. All angles are mea￾sured in a counterclockwise direction from a horizontal line.
To further illustrate the root locus procedure, let us consider the second-order

In principle, we could construct the root locus by determining the points in the 
s-plane that satisfy the angle criterion. In the next section, we develop a multistep 
procedure to sketch the root locus. The root locus for the characteristic equation 
in Equation (7.18) is shown in Figure 7.5(b). Specifically at the root s1, the magni￾tude of the parameter a is found from Equation (7.19) as

where σ2 is evaluated from the s-plane vector lengths as σ2 = K. As a increases

σ2, and one is smaller.
In general, we desire an orderly process for locating the locus of roots as a pa￾rameter varies. In the next section, we will develop such an orderly approach to 
sketching a root locus diagram.

7.3 THE ROOT LOCUS PROCEDURE
The roots of the characteristic equation of a system provide valuable insight con￾cerning the response of the system. To locate the roots of the characteristic equa￾tion in a graphical manner on the s-plane, we develop an orderly procedure of seven 
steps that facilitates the rapid sketching of the locus.
Step 1: Prepare the root locus sketch. Begin by writing the characteristic equa￾tion as
1 0 + = F s( ) . (7.22)
Rearrange the equation, if necessary, so that the parameter of interest, K, appears 
as the multiplying factor in the form,
1 0 + = KP( )s . (7.23)
We are interested in determining the locus of roots when K varies as 0 ≤ K< ∞. In 
Section 7.7, we consider the case when K varies as −∞ < K≤ 0.
Factor P s( ), and write the polynomial in the form of poles and zeros as follows:

Locate the poles −pi and zeros −zi on the s-plane with selected symbols. By con￾vention, we use “x” to denote poles and “o” to denote zeros.
Rewriting Equation (7.24), we have

(7.25)
Note that Equation (7.25) is another way to write the characteristic equation. When 
K = 0, the roots of the characteristic equation are the poles of P s( ). To see this, 
consider Equation (7.25) with K = 0. Then, we have
s p
j
n
∏( ) + = j
=
0.

When solved, this yields the values of s that coincide with the poles of P s( ). 
Conversely, as K → ∞, the roots of the characteristic equation are the zeros of P s( ). 
To see this, first divide Equation (7.25) by K. Then, we have
K s p s z
j
n

which, as K → ∞, reduces to
s z
j
M
∏( ) + = j
=

1
When solved, this yields the values of s that coincide with the zeros of P s( ). 
Therefore, we note that the locus of the roots of the characteristic equation
1 0 + = KP( )s begins at the poles of P s( ) and ends at the zeros of P s( ) as K
increases from zero to infinity. For most functions P s( ) that we will encounter, sev￾eral of the zeros of P s( ) lie at infinity in the s-plane. This is because most of our 
functions have more poles than zeros. With n poles and M zeros and n M> , we 
have n M− branches of the root locus approaching the n M− zeros at infinity.
Step 2: Locate the segments of the real axis that are root loci. The root locus on the 
real axis always lies in a section of the real axis to the left of an odd number of poles and 
zeros. This fact is ascertained by examining the angle criterion of Equation (7.17). These 
two useful steps in plotting a root locus will be illustrated by a suitable example.

Step 2: The angle criterion is satisfied on the real axis between the points 0 and 
−2, because the angle from pole p1 at the origin is 180°, and the angle from the zero 
and pole p2 at s = −4 is zero degrees. The locus begins at the pole and ends at the 
zeros, and therefore the locus of roots appears as shown in Figure 7.6(b), where the 
direction of the locus as K is increasing ( ) K↑ is shown by an arrow. We note that 
because the system has two real poles and one real zero, the second locus segment 
ends at a zero at negative infinity. To evaluate the gain K at a specific root location 
on the locus, we use the magnitude criterion, Equation (7.16). For example, the gain 
K at the root s s = =1 −1 is found from (7.16) as

K . (7.28)
This magnitude can also be evaluated graphically, as shown in Figure 7.6(c). For the 
gain of K = 3 2, one other root exists, located on the locus to the left of the pole at 
−4. The location of the second root is found graphically to be located at s = −6, as 
shown in Figure 7.6(c).
Now, we determine the number of separate loci, SL. Because the loci begin at 
the poles and end at the zeros, the number of separate loci is equal to the number 
of poles since the number of poles is greater than or equal to the number of zeros. 
Therefore, as we found in Figure 7.6, the number of separate loci is equal to two 
because there are two poles and one zero.
Note that the root loci must be symmetrical with respect to the horizontal real 
axis because the complex roots must appear as pairs of complex conjugate roots. ■
We now return to developing a general list of root locus steps.
Step 3: The loci proceed to the zeros at infinity along asymptotes centered at 
σA and with angles φA. When the number of finite zeros of P s( ), M, is less than the 
number of poles n by the number N n = − M, then N sections of loci must end at 
zeros at infinity. These sections of loci proceed to the zeros at infinity along asymp￾totes as K approaches infinity. These linear asymptotes are centered at a point on 
the real axis given by

where k is an integer index [3]. The usefulness of this rule is obvious for sketching 
the approximate form of a root locus. Equation (7.30) can be readily derived by 
considering a point on a root locus segment at a remote distance from the finite 
poles and zeros in the s-plane. The net phase angle at this remote point is 180°, be￾cause it is a point on a root locus segment. The finite poles and zeros of P s( ) are a 
great distance from the remote point, and so the angles from each pole and zero, φ,
are essentially equal, and therefore the net angle is simply ( ) n M− φ, where n and 
M are the number of finite poles and zeros, respectively. Thus, we have
( ) n M− =φ 180°,
or, alternatively,
n M φ = −
180° .
Accounting for all possible root locus segments at remote locations in the s-plane, 
we obtain Equation (7.30).
The center of the linear asymptotes, often called the asymptote centroid, is de￾termined by considering the characteristic equation in Equation (7.24). For large 
values of s, only the higher-order terms need be considered, so that the characteris￾tic equation reduces to
Ks
s
M
n 1 0 + = .
However, this relation, which is an approximation, indicates that the centroid of 
n M− asymptotes is at the origin, s = 0. A better approximation is obtained if we 
consider a characteristic equation of the form
K
s A
n M ( ) σ + − 1 0 − =
with a centroid at σA.
The centroid is determined by considering the first two terms of Equation (7.24),

The root locus is readily sketched, and the locus shown in Figure 7.3 is obtained. An 
example will further illustrate the process of using the asymptotes.

We wish to sketch the root locus in order to determine the effect of the gain K. The

the real axis must be located to the left of an odd number of poles and zeros; they are 
shown as heavy lines in Figure 7.7(a). The intersection of the asymptotes is

The angles of the asymptotes are
φA = +60° ( ) k = 0 ,
φA = = 180°   ( ) k 1 ,  and
φA = = 300°   ( ) k 2 ,
where there are three asymptotes, since n M− = 3. Also, we note that the root loci 
must begin at the poles; therefore, two loci must leave the double pole at s = −4.
Then with the asymptotes sketched in Figure 7.7(b), we may sketch the form of the 
root locus as shown in Figure 7.7(b). The actual shape of the locus in the area near 
σA would be graphically evaluated, if necessary. ■
We now proceed to develop more steps for the process of determining the root loci.
Step 4: Determine where the locus crosses the imaginary axis (if it does so), 
using the Routh–Hurwitz criterion. The actual point at which the root locus 
crosses the imaginary axis is readily evaluated by using the criterion.
Step 5: Determine the breakaway point on the real axis (if any). The root 
locus in Example 7.2 left the real axis at a breakaway point. The locus breakaway 
from the real axis occurs where the net change in angle caused by a small dis￾placement is zero. The locus leaves the real axis where there is a multiplicity of 
roots (typically, two). The breakaway point for a simple second-order system is 
shown in Figure 7.8(a) and, for a special case of a fourth-order system, is shown 
in Figure 7.8(b). In general, due to the phase criterion, the tangents to the loci at 
the breakaway point are equally spaced over 360°. Therefore, in Figure 7.8(a), we 
find that the two loci at the breakaway point are spaced 180° apart, whereas in 
Figure 7.8(b), the four loci are spaced 90° apart.
The breakaway point on the real axis can be evaluated graphically or 
analytically. The most straightforward method of evaluating the breakaway point

involves the rearranging of the characteristic equation to isolate the multiplying 
factor K. Then the characteristic equation is written as
p s( ) = K. (7.33)
For example, consider a unity feedback closed-loop system with a loop transfer 
function

Alternatively, the equation may be written as
K p = = ( )s s − + ( ) 2 4 ( ) s + . (7.35)
The root loci for this system are shown in Figure 7.8(a). We expect the breakaway 
point to be near s = =σ −3 and plot p s( ) |s=σ near that point, as shown in Figure 
7.9. In this case, p s( ) equals zero at the poles s = −2 and s = −4. The plot of 
p s( ) versus s − σ is symmetrical, and the maximum point occurs at s = =σ −3,
the breakaway point.

Analytically, the very same result may be obtained by determining the maximum 
of K p = ( )s . To find the maximum analytically, we differentiate, set the differenti￾ated polynomial equal to zero, and determine the roots of the polynomial. Therefore, 
we may evaluate
dK
ds
dp s
ds
( ) = = 0 (7.36)
in order to find the breakaway point. Equation (7.36) is an analytical expression of 
the graphical procedure outlined in Figure 7.9 and will result in an equation of only 
one degree less than the total number of poles and zeros n M+ − 1.
The proof of Equation (7.36) is obtained from a consideration of the character￾istic equation
F s KY s
X s ( ) ( )
( ) 1 1 + = + = 0,
which may be written as
X s( ) + = KY( )s 0. (7.37)

we obtain
p s( ) = = K s − + ( ) 2 4 ( ) s s + = − + ( ) 6 8 s + . 2 (7.43)
Then, when we differentiate, we have
dp s

s ( ) = −( ) 2 6 + = 0, (7.44)
or the breakaway point occurs at s = −3. A more complicated example will illus￾trate the approach and demonstrate the use of the graphical technique to determine 
the breakaway point.

The number of poles n minus the number of zeros M is equal to 2, and so we have 
two asymptotes at ±90° with a center at σA = −2. The asymptotes and the sections 
of loci on the real axis are shown in Figure 7.11(a). A breakaway point occurs be￾tween s = −2 and s = −3. To evaluate the breakaway point, we rewrite the charac￾teristic equation so that K is separated; thus,

Now to locate the maximum of p s( ), we locate the roots of Equation (7.47) to ob￾tain s j = −2.46,   − ± 0.77 0.79 . The only value of s on the real axis in the interval 
s = −2 to s = −3 is s = −2.46; hence this must be the breakaway point. It is evi￾dent from this one example that the numerical evaluation of p s( ) near the expected 
breakaway point provides an effective method of evaluating the breakaway point. ■
Step 6: Determine the angle of departure of the locus from a pole and the 
angle of arrival of the locus at a zero, using the phase angle criterion. The angle 
of locus departure from a pole is the difference between the net angle due to all 
other poles and zeros and the criterion angle of ± + 180° (2k 1), and similarly for 
the locus angle of arrival at a zero. The angle of departure (or arrival) is particu￾larly of interest for complex poles (and zeros) because the information is helpful 
in completing the root locus. For example, consider the third-order loop transfer 
function

The pole locations and the vector angles at one complex pole −p1 are shown in 
Figure 7.12(a). The angles at a test point s1, an infinitesimal distance from −p1,
must meet the angle criterion. Therefore, since θ2 = 90°, we have

θ θ 1 2 + + θ θ 3 1 = + 90° + = θ3 +180°,
or the angle of departure at pole p1 is
θ θ 1 3 = − 90° ,
as shown in Figure 7.12(b). The departure at pole −p2 is the negative of that at −p1,
because −p1 and −p2 are complex conjugates. Another example of a departure 
angle is shown in Figure 7.13. In this case, the departure angle is found from
θ θ 2 1 − + ( ) θ3 + = 90° 180° + k360°.
Since θ θ 2 3 − = γ in the diagram, we find that the departure angle is θ γ 1 = + 90° .

Hence, the limiting value of gain for stability is K = 568.89, and the roots of the 
auxiliary equation are
53.33s s + = 568.89 53.33( ) + = 10.67 53.33( ) s j + − 3.266 ( ) s j3.266 . 2 2 (7.51)
The points where the locus crosses the imaginary axis are shown in Figure 7.14(a). 
Therefore, when K = 568.89, the root locus crosses the jω-axis at s j = ± 3.266.
5. The breakaway point is estimated by evaluating
K p = = ( )s s − + ( ) s s 4 4 ( ) + + j s 4 4 ( ) + − j4
between s = −4 and s = 0. We expect the breakaway point to lie between s = −3
and s = −1, so we search for a maximum value of p s( ) in that region. The resulting 
values of p s( ) for several values of s are given in Table 7.3. The maximum of p s( ) is 
found to lie at approximately s = −1.577, as indicated in the table. A more accurate 
estimate of the breakaway point is normally not necessary. The breakaway point is 
then indicated on Figure 7.14(a).
6. The angle of departure at the complex pole p1 can be estimated by utilizing the 
angle criterion as follows:
θ θ 1 3 + + 90° 90° + = 180° + k360°.
Here, θ3 is the angle subtended by the vector from pole p3. The angles from the pole 
at s = −4 and s j = −4 4 − are each equal to 90°. Since θ3 = 135°, we find that
θ1 = −135° ≡ +225°,
as shown in Figure 7.14(a).

Using the information derived from the seven steps of the root locus method, 
the complete root locus sketch is obtained by filling in the sketch as well as possi￾ble by visual inspection. The root locus for this system is shown in Figure 7.14(b). 
When the complex roots near the origin have a damping ratio of ζ = 0.707,
the gain K can be determined graphically as shown in Figure 7.14(b). The vector 
lengths to the root location s1 from the open-loop poles are evaluated and result 
in a gain at s1 of
K s = + 1 1s s 4 1 1 − − p s1 1pˆ = = ( ) 1.9 ( ) 2.9 ( ) 3.8 ( ) 6.0 126. (7.52)
The remaining pair of complex roots occurs at s2 and sˆ
2, when K = 126. The effect 
of the complex roots at s2 and sˆ
2 on the transient response will be negligible com￾pared to the roots s1 and sˆ
1. This fact can be ascertained by considering the damping 
of the response due to each pair of roots. The damping due to s1 and sˆ
1 is
e e −ζ ωn t = −σ t
, 1 1 1
and the damping factor due to s2 and sˆ
2 is
e e −ζ ωn t = −σ t
, 2 2 2
where σ2 is approximately five times as large as σ1. Therefore, the transient re￾sponse term due to s2 will decay much more rapidly than the transient response 
term due to s1. Thus, the response to a unit step input may be written as
y t c e t c e t t t ( ) = +1   1 1 − − σ σ 1 2 sin   ( ) ω θ + + 1 2 sin( ) ω θ 2 2 +
c e t t ≈ +1   1 1 −σ sin . ( ) ω θ + 1 1 (7.53)
The complex conjugate roots near the origin of the s-plane relative to the other 
roots of the closed-loop system are labeled the dominant roots of the system because 
they represent or dominate the transient response. The relative dominance of the 
complex roots, in a third-order system with a pair of complex conjugate roots, is 
determined by the ratio of the real root to the real part of the complex roots and will 
result in approximate dominance for ratios exceeding 5.
The dominance of the second term of Equation (7.53) also depends upon the 
relative magnitudes of the coefficients c1 and c2. These coefficients, which are the 
residues evaluated at the complex roots, in turn depend upon the location of 
the zeros in the s-plane. Therefore, the concept of dominant roots is useful for 
estimating the response of a system, but must be used with caution and with a 
comprehension of the underlying assumptions. ■
7.4 PARAMETER DESIGN BY THE ROOT LOCUS METHOD
Originally, the root locus method was developed to determine the locus of roots 
of the characteristic equation as the system gain, K, is varied from zero to infinity. 
However, as we have seen, the effect of other system parameters may be readily 
M07_DORF2374_14_GE_C07.indd 466 26/08/21 12:49 PMSection 7.4 Parameter Design by the Root Locus Method 467
investigated by using the root locus method. Fundamentally, the root locus method 
is concerned with a characteristic equation (Equation 7.22), which may be written as
1 0 + = F s( ) . (7.54)
Then the standard root locus method we have studied may be applied. The ques￾tion arises: How do we investigate the effect of two parameters, α and β? It ap￾pears that the root locus method is a single-parameter method; fortunately, it can 
be readily extended to the investigation of two or more parameters. This method of 
parameter design uses the root locus approach to select the values of the parameters.
The characteristic equation of a dynamic system may be written as
a sn a s a s a n n + + −1 n− + + = 0. 1 1 0 (7.55)
Hence, the effect of varying 0 ≤ < a1 ∞ may be ascertained from the root locus 
equation
a s
a sn a s a s a n n n  +
+ + + + = − − 1 0. 1
1 1 2 2 0
(7.56)
If the parameter of interest, α, does not appear solely as a coefficient, the parame￾ter may be isolated as
a sn a s a s s a s a n n n n q   n q n q + + −1 − + − ( ) − α α − − + + + + = 0. 1 1 0 (7.57)
For example, a third-order equation of interest might be
s s + + ( ) 3 3 α + +s 6 0 = . 3 2 (7.58)
To ascertain the effect of the parameter α, we isolate the parameter and rewrite the 
equation in root locus form, as shown in the following steps:
s s + + 3 3 αs s + + 6 0 = ;   3 2 2 (7.59)
s
s s s
α
+
+ + +
1 = 3 3 6
0.
2
3 2 (7.60)
Then, to determine the effect of two parameters, we must repeat the root locus 
approach twice. Thus, for a characteristic equation with two variable parameters, α
and β, we have
a sn a s a s s n n n n q   n q n q + + −1 −1 + − ( ) − α α − − + +
a s n r s a s a + − ( ) − β β n r − − + + n r + + 1 0 = 0. (7.61)
The two variable parameters have been isolated, and the effect of α will be 
determined. Then, the effect of β will be determined. For example, for a certain 
third-order characteristic equation with α and β as parameters, we obtain
s s + + β α s + = 0. 3 2 (7.62)
In this particular case, the parameters appear as the coefficients of the characteristic 
equation. The effect of varying β from zero to infinity is determined from the root 
locus equation

α

1 0 = . 3 2 (7.63)
We note that the denominator of Equation (7.63) is the characteristic equation of 
the system with β = 0. Therefore, we must first evaluate the effect of varying α
from zero to infinity by using the equation
s s + + α = 0, 3 2
rewritten as
s s
α
( ) +
+
1 = 1 0, 2 (7.64)
where β has been set equal to zero in Equation (7.62). Then, upon evaluating the 
effect of α, a value of α is selected and used with Equation (7.63) to evaluate the ef￾fect of β. This two-step method of evaluating the effect of α and then β may be car￾ried out as two root locus procedures. First, we obtain a locus of roots as α varies, 
and we select a suitable value of α; the results are satisfactory root locations. Then, 
we obtain the root locus for β by noting that the poles of Equation (7.63) are the 
roots evaluated by the root locus of Equation (7.64). A limitation of this approach 
is that we will not always be able to obtain a characteristic equation that is linear in 
the parameter under consideration.
To illustrate this approach, let us obtain the root locus for α and then β for 
Equation (7.62). A sketch of the root locus as α varies for Equation (7.64) is shown 
in Figure 7.15(a), where the roots for two values of gain α are shown. If the gain 
α is selected as α1, then the resultant roots of Equation (7.64) become the poles 
of Equation (7.63). The root locus of Equation (7.63) as β varies is shown in 
Figure 7.15(b), and a suitable β can be selected on the basis of the desired root 
locations.
Using the root locus method, we will further illustrate this parameter design 
approach by a specific design example.

EXAMPLE 7.5 Welding head control
A welding head for an auto body requires an accurate control system for position￾ing the welding head [4]. The feedback control system is to be designed to satisfy 
the following specifications:
1. Steady-state error for a ramp input is ess ≤ 35% of input slope
2. Damping ratio of dominant roots is ζ ≥ 0.707
3. Settling time to within 2% of the final value is Ts  3 ≤ s.
The structure of the feedback control system is shown in Figure 7.16, where the am￾plifier gain K1 and the derivative feedback gain K2 are to be selected. The steady￾state error specification can be written as
lim lim   lim ( )

where G s 2 ( ) = + G s( ) / (1 ) G s( )H s( ) . Therefore, the steady-state error require￾ment is

(7.66)
Thus, we will select a small value of K2 to achieve a low value of steady-state 
error. The damping ratio specification requires that the roots of the closed-loop sys￾tem be below the line at 45° in the left-hand s-plane, as illustrated in Figure 7.17. The 
settling time specification can be rewritten in terms of the real part of the dominant 
roots as
Ts σ = ≤ 4   3 s. (7.67)
Therefore, it is necessary that σ ≥ ; 4
3 this area in the left-hand s-plane is indicated 
along with the ζ − requirement in Figure 7.17. Note that σ ≥ 4
3 implies that we 
want the dominant roots to lie to the left of the line defined by σ = − . 4
3 To satisfy 
the specifications, all the roots must lie within the shaded area of the left-hand plane.

of these roots is σ = −3.15; therefore, the time to settle (to within 2% of the final 
value) is Ts = 1.27 s, which is considerably less than the specification of Ts ≤ 3 s. ■
We can extend the root locus method to more than two parameters by extend￾ing the number of steps in the method outlined in this section. Furthermore, a fam￾ily of root loci can be generated for two parameters in order to determine the total 
effect of varying two parameters. For example, let us determine the effect of vary￾ing α and β of the following characteristic equation:

of Equation (7.73). Then the locus of Equation (7.73) is continued on Figure 7.19 
(dotted lines), where the locus for β is shown for several selected values of α. This 
family of loci, often called root contours, illustrates the effect of α and β on the roots 
of the characteristic equation of a system [3].

7.5 SENSITIVITY AND THE ROOT LOCUS
One of the prime reasons for the use of negative feedback in control systems is the 
reduction of the effect of parameter variations. The effect of parameter variations 
can be described by a measure of the sensitivity of the system performance to spe￾cific parameter changes. We define the logarithmic sensitivity originally suggested 
by Bode as
S T T
K K K
T  ln T
 ln K = , ∂
∂ = ∂ /
∂ / (7.74)
where the system transfer function is T(s) and the parameter of interest is K.
It is useful to define a sensitivity measure in terms of the positions of the roots 
of the characteristic equation [7–9]. Because these roots represent the dominant 
modes of transient response, the effect of parameter variations on the position of 
the roots is an important and useful measure of the sensitivity. The root sensitivity
of a system T(s) can be defined as
 ln K
S , r r
K K K
r i i i = ∂
∂ = ∂
∂ / (7.75)
where ri equals the ith root of the system, so that

(7.76)
and K is a parameter affecting the roots. The root sensitivity relates the changes in 
the location of the root in the s-plane to the change in the parameter. The root sen￾sitivity is related to the logarithmic sensitivity by the relation
S r

when the zeros of T s( ) are independent of the parameter K, so that
∂zj
∂ =  ln K
0.
This logarithmic sensitivity can be readily obtained by determining the derivative of 
T s( ) in Equation (7.76) with respect to K. For this particular case, when the gain of 
the system is independent of the parameter K, we have

The evaluation of the root sensitivity for a control system can be readily ac￾complished by utilizing the root locus methods of the preceding section. The root 
sensitivity SK
ri may be evaluated at root −ri by examining the root contours for the 
parameter K. We can change K by a small finite amount ∆K and determine the 
modified root − + ( ) r r i i ∆ at K K + ∆ . Then, using Equation (7.75), we have
S . r
K K K
r i i ≈ ∆
∆ / (7.79)
Equation (7.79) is an approximation that approaches the actual value of the sen￾sitivity as ∆ →K 0. An example will illustrate the process of evaluating the root 
sensitivity.

The characteristic equation of the feedback control system shown in Figure 7.20 is
K
s s( ) β +
+
1 0 = ,
or, alternatively,
s s + + β K = 0. 2 (7.80)
The gain K will be considered to be the parameter α. Then the effect of a change in 
each parameter can be determined by utilizing the relations
α α = ±0 0 ∆ = α β and , β β ± ∆
where α0 and β0 are the nominal or desired values for the parameters α and β,
respectively. We shall consider the case when the nominal value is β0 = 1 and the 
desired gain is α0 = = K 0.5. Then the root locus can be obtained as a function of 
α = K by utilizing the root locus equation

as shown in Figure 7.21. The nominal value of gain K = = α0 0.5 results in two 
complex roots, − = r j 1 − + 0.5 0.5 and − = r r 2 1 −ˆ , as shown in Figure 7.21. To eval￾uate the effect of changes in the gain, the characteristic equation with α α = ±0 ∆α

Therefore, the effect of changes in the gain can be evaluated from the root locus

a gain α = 0.4 and α = 0.6 are readily determined by root locus methods, and the 
root locations for ∆ = α ±0.1 are shown in Figure 7.21. When α = = K 0.6, the

second quadrant is

For infinitesimally small changes in the parameter K, the sensitivity will be equal 
for negative or positive increments in K. The angle of the root sensitivity indicates 
the direction the root moves as the parameter varies. The angle of movement for 
+∆α is always 180° from the angle of movement for −∆α at the point α α = 0.
The pole β variation is represented by β β = +0 ∆β, where β0 = 1. Then the

The denominator of the second term is the unchanged characteristic equation when 
∆ =β 0. The root locus for the unchanged system ( ) ∆ =β 0 is shown in Figure 7.21 
as a function of K. For a design specification requiring ζ = 0.707, the complex roots 
lie at
− = r j 1 2 − + 0.5 0.5 and − = r r − =ˆ
1 − − 0.5 j0.5.
Then, because the roots are complex conjugates, the root sensitivity for r1 is the 
conjugate of the root sensitivity for r r ˆ
1 2 = . Using the parameter root locus tech￾niques discussed in the preceding section, we obtain the root locus for ∆β as 
shown in Figure 7.22. We are normally interested in the effect of a variation for 
the parameter so that β β = ±0 ∆β, for which the locus as β decreases is obtained 
from the root locus equation

Comparing this equation with Equation (7.23) in Section 7.3, we find that the sign 
preceding the gain ∆β is negative in this case. In a manner similar to the develop￾ment of the root locus method in Section 7.3, we require that the root locus satisfy

where k is an integer. The locus of roots follows a zero-degree locus in contrast with 
the 180° locus considered previously. However, the root locus rules of Section 7.3 
may be altered to account for the zero-degree phase angle requirement, and then 
the root locus may be obtained as in the preceding sections. Therefore, to obtain 
the effect of reducing β, we determine the zero-degree locus in contrast to the 
180° locus, as shown by a dotted locus in Figure 7.22. To find the effect of a 20% 
change of the parameter β, we evaluate the new roots for ∆ =β ±0.20, as shown in 
Figure 7.22. The root sensitivity is readily evaluated graphically and, for a positive 
change in β, is

As the percentage change ∆ /β β decreases, the sensitivity measures β+ Sr1 and β− Sr1
will approach equality in magnitude and a difference in angle of 180°. Thus, for 
small changes when ∆ /β β ≤ 0.10, the sensitivity measures are related as
1 1 S S r r

180° . S S 1 1 r r
β = + + β−
Often, the desired root sensitivity measure is desired for small changes in the 
parameter. When the relative change in the parameter is of the order ∆ /β β = 0.10,
we can estimate the increment in the root change by approximating the root locus 
with the line at the angle of departure θd. This approximation is shown in Figure 7.22 
and is accurate for only relatively small changes in ∆β. However, the use of this ap￾proximation allows the analyst to avoid sketching the complete root locus diagram. 
Therefore, for Figure 7.22, the root sensitivity may be evaluated for ∆ /β β = 0.10
along the departure line, and we obtain
= − Sβ+ = − r 0.075 132°
0.10
0.75 132°. 1 (7.85)
The root sensitivity measure for a parameter variation is useful for comparing the 
sensitivity for various design parameters and at different root locations. Comparing 
Equation (7.85) for β with Equation (7.83) for α, we find (a) that the sensitivity for 
β is greater in magnitude by approximately 50% and (b) that the angle for β− Sr1
indicates that the approach of the root toward the jω-axis is more  sensitive for 
changes in β. Therefore, the tolerance requirements for β would be more stringent 
than for α. This information provides the designer with a comparative measure of 
the required tolerances for each parameter. ■
M07_DORF2374_14_GE_C07.indd 476 26/08/21 12:49 PMTo utilize the root sensitivity measure for the analysis and design of control sys￾tems, a series of calculations must be performed; they will determine the various se￾lections of possible root configurations and the zeros and poles of the loop transfer 
function. Therefore, the root sensitivity measure as a design technique is somewhat 
limited by the relatively large number of calculations required and the lack of an obvi￾ous direction for adjusting the parameters in order to provide a minimized or reduced 
sensitivity. However, the root sensitivity measure can be utilized as an analysis mea￾sure, which permits the designer to compare the sensitivity for several system designs 
based on a suitable method of design. The root sensitivity measure is a useful index of 
the system sensitivity to parameter variations expressed in the s-plane. The weakness 
of the sensitivity measure is that it relies on the ability of the root locations to rep￾resent the performance of the system. The root locations represent the performance 
quite adequately for many systems, but due consideration must be given to the loca￾tion of the zeros of the closed-loop transfer function and the dominant roots. The root 
sensitivity measure is a suitable measure of system performance sensitivity and can be 
used reliably for system analysis and design.
7.6 PID CONTROLLERS
One form of controller widely used in industrial process control is the three-term, 
PID controller [4, 10]. This controller has a transfer function
G s K . K
s c p K s I ( ) = + + D
The equation for the output in the time domain is
u t K e t K e t dt K de t
dt p I D . ∫ ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) = + +
The three-term controller is called a PID controller because it contains a proportional, 
an integral, and a derivative term represented by Kp, KI, and KD, respectively. The 
transfer function of the derivative term is actually
1
G s , K s
s
d
D
τd
( ) = +
but τd is usually much smaller than the time constants of the process itself, so it is 
neglected.
If we set KD = 0, then we have the proportional plus integral (PI) controller
G s K . K
s c p
I ( ) = +
When KI = 0, we have
G s K K s, c p ( ) = + D
which is called a proportional plus derivative (PD) controller.

complex zeros −z1 and −z2, where − = z j 1 − +3 1 and − = z z 2 1 −ˆ . We plot the root

The percent overshoot to a step will be P O. . ≤ 2%, and the steady-state error for 
a step input will be ess = 0. The settling time will be approximately Ts = 1 s. If a 
shorter settling time is desired, then we select z1 and z2 to lie further left in the 
left-hand s-plane and set KD to drive the roots near the complex zeros.
The popularity of PID controllers can be attributed partly to their good per￾formance over a wide range of operating conditions and partly to their functional 
simplicity that allows engineers to operate them in a simple, straightforward 
manner. To implement the PID controller, three parameters must be determined, 
the proportional gain, denoted by KP, integral gain, denoted by KI, and derivative 
gain denoted by KD [10].
There are many methods available to determine acceptable values of the 
PID gains. The process of determining the gains is often called PID tuning. A 
common approach to tuning is to use manual PID tuning methods, whereby the 
PID control gains are obtained by trial-and-error with minimal analytic analy￾sis using step responses obtained via simulation, or in some cases, actual testing 
on the system and deciding on the gains based on observations and experience. 
A more analytic method is known as the Ziegler–Nichols tuning method. The 
Ziegler–Nichols tuning method actually has several variations. We discuss in this 
section a Ziegler–Nichols tuning method based on open-loop responses to a step 
input and a related a Ziegler–Nichols tuning method based on closed-loop re￾sponse to a step input.

One approach to manual tuning is to first set KI = 0 and KD = 0. This is 
followed by slowly increasing the gain KP until the output of the closed-loop 
system oscillates just on the edge of instability. This can be done either in sim￾ulation or on the actual system if it cannot be taken off-line. Once the value of 
KP (with KI = 0 and KD = 0) is found that brings the closed-loop system to the 
edge of stability, you reduce the value of gain KP to achieve what is known as 
the quarter amplitude decay. That is, the amplitude of the closed-loop response 
is reduced approximately to one-fourth of the maximum value in one oscillatory 
period. A rule-of-thumb is to start by reducing the proportional gain KP by one￾half. The next step of the design process is to increase KI and KD manually to 
achieve a desired step response. Table 7.4 describes in general terms the effect of 
increasing KI and KD.
EXAMPLE 7.7 Manual PID tuning
Consider the closed-loop system in Figure 7.25, where b = 10, ζ = 0.707, and ωn = 4. 
To begin the manual tuning process, set KI = 0 and KD = 0 and increase KP
until the closed-loop system has sustained oscillations. As can be seen in Figure 
7.26(a), when KP = 885.5, we have a sustained oscillation of magnitude A = 1.9
and period P = 0.83 s. The root locus shown in Figure 7.26(b) corresponds to 
the characteristic equation

Reduce KP = 885.5 by half as a first step to achieving a step response with 
approximately a quarter amplitude decay. You may have to iterate on the value 
KP = 442.75. The step response is shown in Figure 7.27 where we note that the 
peak amplitude is reduced to one-fourth of the maximum value in one period, as 
desired. To accomplish this reduction, we refined the value of KP by slowly reduc￾ing the value from KP = 442.75 to KP = 370.
The root locus for KP = 370, KI = 0, and 0 ≤ < KD ∞ is shown in Figure 7.28.

We see in Figure 7.28 that as KD increases, the root locus shows that the 
closed-loop complex poles move left, and in doing so, increases the associated 
damping ratio and thereby decreases the percent overshoot. The movement of the 
complex poles to the left also increases the associated ζωn, thereby reducing the 
settling time. These effects of varying KD are consistent with information provided 
in Table 7.4. As KD increases (when KD > 75), the real root begins to dominant the 
response and the trends described in Table 7.4 become less accurate. The percent 
overshoot and settling time as a function of KD are shown in Figure 7.29.

We see in Figure 7.30 that as KI increases, the root locus shows that the closed￾loop complex pair poles move right. This decreases the associated damping ratio 
and thereby increasing the percent overshoot. In fact, when KI = 778.2, the sys￾tem is marginally stable with closed-loop poles at s j = ±4.86 . The movement of the 
complex poles to the right also decreases the associated ζωn, thereby increasing the 
settling time. The percent overshoot and settling time as a function of KI are shown 
in Figure 7.31. The trends in Figure 7.31 are consistent with Table 7.4.
To meet the percent overshoot and settling time specifications, we can select 
KP = 370, KD = 60, and KI = 100. The step response shown in Figure 7.32 indi￾cates a Ts = 2.4 s and P O. . = 12.8% meeting the specifications. ■
Two important PID controller gain tuning methods were published in 1942 by 
John G. Ziegler and Nathaniel B. Nichols intended to achieve a fast closed-loop 
step response without excessive oscillations and excellent disturbance rejection. The 
two approaches are classified under the general heading of Ziegler–Nichols tuning 
methods. The first approach is based on closed-loop concepts requiring the compu￾tation of the ultimate gain and ultimate period. The second approach is based on 
open-loop concepts relying on reaction curves. The Ziegler–Nichols tuning meth￾ods are based on assumed forms of the models of the process, but the models do 
not have to be precisely known. This makes the tuning approach very practical in

process control applications. Our suggestion is to consider the Ziegler–Nichols rules 
to obtain initial controller designs followed by design iteration and refinement. 
Remember that the Ziegler–Nichols rules will not work with all plants or processes.
The closed-loop Ziegler–Nichols tuning method considers the closed-loop sys￾tem response to a step input (or step disturbance) with the PID controller in the 
loop. Initially the derivative and integral gains, KD and KI, respectively, are set to 
zero. The proportional gain KP is increased (in simulation or on the actual system) 
until the closed-loop system reaches the boundary of instability. The gain on the 
border of instability, denoted by KU, is called the ultimate gain. The period of the 
sustained oscillations, denoted by PU, is called the ultimate period. Once KU and

less than that of the Ziegler–Nichols tuning. This is due to the fact that the Ziegler–
Nichols tuning is designed to provide the best disturbance rejection performance 
rather than the best input response performance.

In Figure 7.34, we see that the step disturbance performance of the Ziegler–
Nichols PID controller is indeed better than the manually tuned controller. While 
Ziegler–Nichols approach provides a structured procedure for obtaining the PID 
controller gains, the appropriateness of the Ziegler–Nichols tuning depends on the 
requirements of the problem under investigation. ■
The open-loop Ziegler–Nichols tuning method utilizes a reaction curve ob￾tained by taking the controller off-line (that is, out of the loop) and introducing a 
step input (or step disturbance). This approach is very commonly used in process 
control applications. The measured output is the reaction curve and is assumed to 
have the general shape shown in Figure 7.35. The response in Figure 7.35 implies 
that the process is a first-order system with a transport delay. If the actual system 
does not match the assumed form, then another approach to PID tuning should be

considered. However, if the underlying system is linear and lethargic (or sluggish 
and characterized by delay), the assumed model may suffice to obtain a reasonable 
PID gain selection using the open-loop Ziegler–Nichols tuning method.
The reaction curve is characterized by the transport delay, ∆T, and the reac￾tion rate, R. Generally, the reaction curve is recorded and numerical analysis is per￾formed to obtain estimates of the parameters ∆T and R. A system possessing the 
reaction curve shown in Figure 7.35 can be approximated by a first-order system 
with a transport delay as

where M is the magnitude of the response at steady-state, ∆T is the transport delay, 
and p is related to the slope of the reaction curve. The parameters M, τ, and ∆T
can be estimated from the open-loop step response and then utilized to compute 
R M = /τ. Once that is accomplished, the PID gains are computed as shown in 
Table 7.6. You can also use the Ziegler–Nichols open-loop tuning method to design 
a proportional controller or a proportional-plus-integral controller.
EXAMPLE 7.9 Open-loop Ziegler–Nichols PI controller tuning
Consider the reaction curve shown in Figure 7.36. We estimate the transport lag to 
be ∆ = T 0.1 s and the reaction rate R = 0.8.

methods do provide structured design steps leading to candidate PID gains and should 
be viewed as first steps in the design iteration. Since the PID (and the related PD and 
PI) controllers are in wide use today in a variety of applications, it is important to be￾come familiar with various design approaches. We will use the PD controller later in 
this chapter to control the hard disk drive sequential design problem (see Section 7.10).
7.7 NEGATIVE GAIN ROOT LOCUS
As discussed in Section 7.2, the dynamic performance of a closed-loop control sys￾tem is described by the closed-loop transfer function, that is, by the poles and zeros 
of the closed-loop system. The root locus is a graphical illustration of the variation

of the roots of the characteristic equation as a single parameter of interest varies. 
We know that the roots of the characteristic equation and the closed-loop poles 
are one in the same. In the case of the single-loop negative unity feedback system 
shown in Figure 7.1, the characteristic equation is
1 0 + = KG( )s , (7.86)
where K is the parameter of interest. The orderly seven-step procedure for sketch￾ing the root locus described in Section 7.3 and summarized in Table 7.2 is valid 
for the case where 0 ≤ < K ∞. Sometimes the situation arises where we are in￾terested in the root locus for negative values of the parameter of interest where 
−∞ < ≤ K 0. We refer to this as the negative gain root locus. Our objective here 
is to develop an orderly procedure for sketching the negative gain root locus using 
familiar concepts from root locus sketching as described in Section 7.2.
Rearranging Equation (7.86) yields
G s( ) = − K
1 .
Since K is negative, it follows that
KG( )s K = = 1 and G s( ) 0° + k360° (7.87)
where k = ± 0,   1,   ± ± 2,   3,…. The magnitude and phase conditions in Equation 
(7.87) must both be satisfied for all points on the negative gain root locus. Note 
that the phase condition in Equation (7.87) is different from the phase condition 
in Equation (7.4). As we will show, the new phase condition leads to several key 
modifications in the root locus sketching steps from those summarized in Table 7.2.

Sketching the root locus yields the plot shown in Figure 7.39(a) where it can be seen 
that the closed-loop system is not stable for any 0 ≤ < K ∞. The negative gain root 
locus is shown in Figure 7.39(b). Using the negative gain root locus in Figure 7.39(b) 
we find that the stability is − < 5.0 K < −2.5. The system in Figure 7.38 can thus be 
stabilized with only negative gain, K. ■
To locate the roots of the characteristic equation in a graphical manner on the 
s-plane for negative values of the parameter of interest, we will re-visit the seven 
steps summarized in Table 7.2 to obtain a similar orderly procedure to facilitate the 
rapid sketching of the locus.

Step 1: Prepare the root locus sketch. As before, you begin by writing the char￾acteristic equation and rearranging, if necessary, so that the parameter of interest, 
K, appears as the multiplying factor in the form,
1 0 + = KP( )s . (7.88)
For the negative gain root locus, we are interested in determining the locus of roots of 
the characteristic equation in Equation (7.88) for −∞ < ≤ K 0. As in Equation (7.24), 
factor P s( ) in Equation (7.88) in the form of poles and zeros and locate the poles 
and zeros on the s-plane with “x” to denote poles and “o” to denote zeros.
When K = 0, the roots of the characteristic equation are the poles of P s( ), 
and when K → −∞ the roots of the characteristic equation are the zeros of P s( ). 
Therefore, the locus of the roots of the characteristic equation begins at the poles 
of P s( ) when K = 0 and ends at the zeros of P s( ) as K → −∞. If P s( ) has n poles 
and M zeros and n M> , we have n M− branches of the root locus approaching 
the zeros at infinity and the number of separate loci is equal to the number of 
poles. The root loci are symmetrical with respect to the horizontal real axis be￾cause the complex roots must appear as pairs of complex conjugate roots.
Step 2: Locate the segments of the real axis that are root loci. The root locus on 
the real axis always lies in a section of the real axis to the left of an even number of 
poles and zeros. This follows from the angle criterion of Equation (7.87).
Step 3: When n M> , we have n M− branches heading to the zeros at infinity 
as K → −∞ along asymptotes centered at σA and with angles φA. The linear as￾ymptotes are centered at a point on the real axis given by
poles of   zeros of

Step 4: Determine where the locus crosses the imaginary axis (if it does so), 
using the Routh–Hurwitz criterion.
Step 5: Determine the breakaway point on the real axis (if any). In general, due 
to the phase criterion, the tangents to the loci at the breakaway point are equally 
spaced over 360°. The breakaway point on the real axis can be evaluated graphically 
or analytically. The breakaway point can be computed by rearranging the charac￾teristic equation

Equation (7.91) yields a polynomial equation in s of degree n M+ − 1, where n is 
the number of poles and M is the number of zeros. Hence the number of solutions 
is n M+ − 1. The solutions that exist on the root locus are the breakaway points.
Step 6: Determine the angle of departure of the locus from a pole and the angle 
of arrival of the locus at a zero using the phase angle criterion. The angle of locus 
departure from a pole or angle of arrival at a zero is the difference between the net 
angle due to all other poles and zeros and the criterion angle of ±k360°.
Step 7: The final step is to complete the sketch by drawing in all sections of the 
locus not covered in the previous six steps.
The seven steps for sketching a negative gain root locus are summarized in

7.8 DESIGN EXAMPLES
In this section we present two illustrative examples. The first example is a wind tur￾bine control system. The feedback control system uses a PI controller to achieve a 
fast settling time and rise time while limiting the percent overshoot to a step input. 
In the second example, the automatic control of the velocity of an automobile is 
considered. The root locus method is extended from one parameter to three param￾eters as the three gains of a PID controller are determined. The design process is 
emphasized, including considering the control goals and associated variables to be 
controlled, the design specifications, and the PID controller design using root locus 
methods.
EXAMPLE 7.11 Wind turbine speed control
Wind energy conversion to electric power is achieved by wind energy turbines con￾nected to electric generators. Of particular interest are wind turbines, as shown in 
Figure 7.40, that are located offshore [33]. The new concept is to allow the wind 
turbine to float rather than positioning the structure on a tower tied deep into the

ocean floor. This allows the wind turbine structure to be placed in deeper waters up 
to 100 miles offshore far enough not to burden the landscape with unsightly struc￾tures [34]. Moreover, the wind is generally stronger on the open ocean, potentially 
leading to the production of 5 MW versus the more typical 1.5 MW for wind tur￾bines onshore. However, the irregular character of wind direction and power results 
in the need for reliable, steady electric energy by using control systems for the wind 
turbines. The goal of these control devices is to reduce the effects of wind intermit￾tency and of wind direction change. The rotor and generator speed control can be 
achieved by adjusting the pitch angle of the blades.
A basic model of the generator speed control system is shown in Figure 7.41 
[35]. A linearized model from the collective pitch to the generator speed is given by1

diameter = 40 m, rated rotor speed = 41.7 rpm, rated generator speed = 1800 rpm, 
and maximum pitch rate = 18.7 deg/s. Note that the linearized model in Equation

The main design specification is to have a settling time Ts < 4 s to a unit step input. 
We also desire a limited percent overshoot (.. P O < 25%) and a short rise time 
( 1 Tr <  s) while meeting the settling time specification. To this end, we will target 
the damping ratio of the dominant roots to be ζ > 0.4 and the natural frequency 
ωn > 2.5 rad/s.

The step response is shown in Figure 7.43 using the simplified first-order model in

translates to P O. . = 19%. The PI controller is able to meet all the control specifi￾cations. The step response using the third-order model in Equation (7.92) is shown

as small oscillations in the speed response. The closed-loop impulse disturbance

EXAMPLE 7.12 Automobile velocity control
The automotive electronics market is expected to surpass $300 billion. It is pre￾dicted that there will be an annual growth rate of over 7% in electronic braking, 
steering, and driver information. Much of the additional computing power will 
M07_DORF2374_14_GE_C07.indd 496 26/08/21 12:50 PMSection 7.8 Design Examples 497
be used for new technology for smart cars and smart roads, such as IVHS (intelli￾gent vehicle/highway systems) [14, 30, 31]. New systems on-board the automobile 
will support semi-autonomous automobiles, safety enhancements, emission re￾duction, and other features including intelligent cruise control, and brake by wire 
systems eliminating the hydraulics [32].
The term IVHS refers to a varied assortment of electronics that provides real-time 
information on accidents, congestion, and roadside services to drivers and traffic con￾trollers. IVHS also encompasses devices that make vehicles more autonomous: colli￾sion-avoidance systems and lane-tracking technology that alert drivers to impending 
disasters and allow a car to drive itself.
An example of an automated highway system is shown in Figure 7.46. A velocity 
control system for maintaining the velocity between vehicles is shown in Figure 7.47. 
The output Y s( ) is the relative velocity of the two automobiles; the input R s( ) is the 
desired relative velocity between the two vehicles. Our design goal is to develop a 
controller that can maintain the prescribed velocity between the vehicles and maneu￾ver the active vehicle (in this case the rearward automobile) as commanded. The el￾ements of the design process emphasized in this example are depicted in Figure 7.48.
The control goal is

The design specifications are
Design Specifications
DS1 Zero steady-state error to a step input.
DS2 Steady-state error due to a ramp input of ess ≤ 25% of the input magnitude.
DS3 Percent overshoot of P.O. ≤ 5% to a step input.
DS4 Settling time of Ts ≤ 1.5 s to a step input (using a 2% criterion to 
establish settling time).
From the design specifications and knowledge of the open-loop system, we find that 
we need a type 1 system to guarantee a zero steady-state error to a step input. The 
open-loop system transfer function is a type 0 system; therefore, the controller needs 
to increase the system type by at least 1. A type 1 controller (that is, a controller

The desired region for the poles of the closed-loop transfer function is shown in 
Figure 7.49. Using a proportional controller G s( ) = K , c P is not reasonable, because 
DS2 cannot be satisfied. We need at least one pole at the origin to track a ramp input.

since we have three poles (at s = − 0,   2,  and  − 8) and one zero (at s K = − I P /K ),

The root locus is shown in Figure 7.50. To meet the ζ = 0.69 (which evolved 
from DS3), we need to select KP < 30. We selected the value at the boundary of the 
performance region (see Figure 7.50) as carefully as possible.
M07_DORF2374_14_GE_C07.indd 501 26/08/21 12:50 PM502 Chapter 7 The Root Locus Method
Selecting KP = 26, we have K KI P / = 2.5 which implies K = 65. I This satisfies 
the steady-state tracking error specification (DS2) since K = > 65 64. I
The resulting PI controller is

The step response is shown in Figure 7.51.
The percent overshoot is P O. . = 8%, and the settling time is T s s = 1.45  . The per￾cent overshoot specification is not precisely satisfied, but the controller in Equation 
(7.101) represents a very good first design. We can iteratively refine it. Even though 
the closed-loop poles lie in the desired region, the response does not exactly meet the 
specifications because the controller zero influences the response. The closed-loop 
system is a third-order system and does not have the performance of a second-order 
system. We might consider moving the zero to s = −2 (by choosing K KI P / = 2 ) so 
that the pole at s = −2 is cancelled and the resulting system is a second-order system.
7.9 THE ROOT LOCUS USING CONTROL DESIGN SOFTWARE
An approximate root locus sketch can be obtained by applying the orderly procedure 
summarized in Table 7.2. Alternatively, we can use control design software to obtain 
an accurate root locus plot. However, we should not be tempted to rely solely on the 
computer for obtaining root locus plots while neglecting the manual steps in devel￾oping an approximate root locus. The fundamental concepts behind the root locus

method are embedded in the manual steps, and it is essential to understand their 
application fully.
The section begins with a discussion on obtaining a computer-generated root 
locus plot. This is followed by a discussion of the connections between the partial 
fraction expansion, dominant poles, and the closed-loop system response. Root sensi￾tivity is covered in the final paragraphs.
The functions covered in this section are rlocus, rlocfind, and residue. The func￾tions rlocus and rlocfind are used to obtain root locus plots, and the residue function 
is utilized for partial fraction expansions of rational functions.

where K is the parameter of interest to be varied from 0 ≤ < K ∞. The rlocus func￾tion is shown in Figure 7.52, where we define the transfer function object sys . = G s( )
The steps to obtaining the root locus plot associated with Equation (7.102), along 
with the associated root locus plot, are shown in Figure 7.53. Invoking the rlocus
function without left-hand arguments results in an automatic generation of the root 
locus plot. When invoked with left-hand arguments, the rlocus function returns a ma￾trix of root locations and the associated gain vector.
The steps to obtain a computer-generated root locus plot are as follows:
1. Obtain the characteristic equation in the form given in Equation (7.103), where K is the 
parameter of interest.
2. Use the rlocus function to generate the plots.
Referring to Figure 7.53, we can see that as K increases, two branches of the root 
locus break away from the real axis. This means that, for some values of K, the closed￾loop system characteristic equation will have two complex roots. Suppose we want to 
find the value of K corresponding to a pair of complex roots. We can use the rlocfind

function to do this, but only after a root locus has been obtained with the rlocus
function. Executing the rlocfind function will result in a cross-hair marker appearing on 
the root locus plot. We move the cross-hair marker to the location on the locus of in￾terest and hit the enter key. The value of the parameter K and the value of the selected 
point will then be displayed in the command display. The use of the rlocfind function is 
illustrated in Figure 7.54.
Control design software packages may respond differently when interacting with 
plots, such as with the rlocfind function on the root locus. The response of rlocfind
in Figure 7.54 corresponds to MATLAB. Refer to the companion website for more 
information on other control design software applications.
Continuing our third-order root locus example, we find that when K = 20.5775,

Generally, the first step in computing y t( ) is to expand Equation (7.104) in a partial 
fraction expansion. The residue function can be used to expand Equation (7.104), as 
shown in Figure 7.55. The residue function is described in Figure 7.56.

Comparing the residues, we see that the coefficient of the term corresponding to 
the pole at s = −0.8989 is considerably smaller than the coefficient of the terms 
corresponding to the complex-conjugate poles at s j = −2.0505 ± 4.3227. From this, 
we expect that the influence of the pole at s = −0.8989 on the output response y t( )
is not dominant. The settling time (to within 2% of the final value) is then predicted 
by considering the complex-conjugate poles. The poles at s j = −2.0505 ± 4.3227
correspond to a damping of ζ = 0.4286 and a natural frequency of ωn = 4.7844.
Thus, the settling time is predicted to be

Using the step function, as shown in Figure 7.57, we find that Ts = 1.6 s. Hence, our 
approximation of settling time Ts  1.95 s is a fairly good approximation. The percent 
overshoot is predicted (considering the zero of T s( ) at s = −3) to be P O. . = 60%. As 
can be seen in Figure 7.57, the actual overshoot is P O. . = 50%.
When using the step function, we can right-click on the figure to access the pull￾down menu, which allows us to determine the step response settling time and peak re￾sponse, as illustrated in Figure 7.57. On the pull-down menu select “Characteristics” 
and select “Settling Time.” A dot will appear on the figure at the settling point. Place 
the cursor over the dot to determine the settling time.
In this example, the role of the system zeros on the transient response is illus￾trated. The proximity of the zero at s = −1 to the pole at s = −0.8989 reduces the 
impact of that pole on the transient response. The main contributors to the transient

response are the complex-conjugate poles at s j = −2.0505 ± 4.3228 and the zero at 
s = −3.
There is one final point regarding the residue function: We can convert the partial 
fraction expansion back to the polynomials num/den, given the residues r, the pole loca￾tions p, and the direct terms k, with the command shown in Figure 7.58.
Sensitivity and the Root Locus. The roots of the characteristic equation play an 
important role in defining the closed-loop system transient response. The effect of 
parameter variations on the roots of the characteristic equation is a useful measure 
of sensitivity. The root sensitivity is defined in Equation (7.75). We can use Equation 
(7.75) to investigate the sensitivity of the roots of the characteristic equation to varia￾tions in the parameter K. If we change K by a small finite amount ∆K, and evaluate 
the modified root r r i i + ∆ , it follows that SK
ri is given in Equation (7.79).
The quantity SK
ri is a complex number. Referring back to the third-order exam￾ple of Figure 7.10 (Equation 7.102), if we change K by a factor of 5%, we find that the 
dominant complex-conjugate pole at s j = −2.0505 + 4.3228 changes by
r j ∆ =i − − 0.0025 0.1168
when K changes from K = 20.5775 to K = 21.6064. From Equation (7.79), it fol￾lows that

as shown in Figure 7.61. We can quickly sketch the root locus, as shown in Figure 7.61. 
We use the computer-generated root locus to determine the root values for var￾ious values of KD. When KD = 91.3, we obtain the roots shown in Figure 7.61. 
Then, obtaining the system response, we achieve the actual response measures as 
listed in Table 7.8. As designed, the system meets all the specifications. It takes 
the system a settling time of 20 ms to “practically” reach the final value. In reality, 
the system drifts very slowly toward the final value after quickly achieving 97% 
of the final value.
7.11 SUMMARY
The relative stability and the transient response performance of a closed-loop control 
system are directly related to the location of the closed-loop roots of the characteristic 
equation. We investigated the movement of the characteristic roots on the s-plane as 
key system parameters (such as controller gains) are varied. The root locus and the neg￾ative gain root locus are graphical representations of the variation of the system closed￾loop poles as one parameter varies. The plots can be sketched using a given set of rules 
in order to analyze the initial design of a system and determine suitable alterations of 
the system structure and the parameter values. A computer is then commonly used to 
obtain the accurate root locus for use in the final design and analysis. A summary of 
fifteen typical root locus diagrams is shown in Table 7.9.

M07_DORF2374_14_GE_C07.indd 513 26/08/21 12:50 PM514 Chapter 7 The Root Locus Method
Furthermore, we extended the root locus method for the design of several pa￾rameters for a closed-loop control system. Then the sensitivity of the characteristic 
roots was investigated for undesired parameter variations by defining a root sensitiv￾ity measure. It is clear that the root locus method is a powerful and useful approach 
for the analysis and design of modern control systems and will continue to be one of 
the most important procedures of control engineering.

P7.7 The speed control system for an isolated power 
system is shown in Figure P7.7. The valve controls the 
steam flow input to the turbine in order to account 
for load changes ∆L s( ) within the power distribu￾tion network. The equilibrium speed desired results 
in a generator frequency equal to 60 cps. The effec￾tive rotary inertia J is equal to 4000 and the friction 
constant b is equal to 0.75. The steady-state speed 
regulation factor R is represented by the equation 
R L ≈ − ( ) ω ω 0 r   , /∆ where ωr equals the speed at 
rated load and ω0 equals the speed at no load. We 
want to obtain a very small R, usually less than 0.10. 
(a) Using root locus techniques, determine the regula￾tion R attainable when the damping ratio of the roots 
of the system must be greater than 0.60. (b) Verify 
that the steady-state speed deviation for a load torque 
change ∆ = L s( ) ∆ /L s is, in fact, approximately equal 
to R L∆ when R ≤ 0.1.
P7.8 Consider again the power control system of Problem 
P7.7 when the steam turbine is replaced by a hydrotur￾bine. For hydroturbines, the large inertia of the water 
used as a source of energy causes a considerably larger

P7.10 New concepts in passenger airliner design will have 
the range to cross the Pacific in a single flight and the 
efficiency to make it economical [16, 29]. These new 
designs will require the use of temperature-resistant, 
lightweight materials and advanced control systems. 
Noise control is an important issue in modern aircraft 
designs since most airports have strict noise level re￾quirements. An advanced airliner is depicted in Figure 
P7.10(a). It would seat 200 passengers and cruise at 
just below the speed of sound. The flight control sys￾tem must provide good handling characteristics and 
comfortable flying conditions. An automatic control 
system can be designed for the next generation pas￾senger aircraft.
The desired characteristics of the dominant roots 
of the control system shown in Figure P7.10(b) have 
a ζ = 0.707. The characteristics of the aircraft are 
ω ζ n = = 2.5,  0.30, and τ = 0.1. The gain factor 
K , 1 however, will vary over the range 0.02 at medi￾um-weight cruise conditions to 0.20 at lightweight de￾scent conditions. (a) Sketch the root locus as a function 
of the loop gain K K . 1 2 (b) Determine the gain K2 nec￾essary to yield roots with ζ = 0.707 when the aircraft is 
in the medium-cruise condition. (c) With the gain K2
as found in part (b), determine the ζ of the roots when 
the gain K1 results from the condition of light descent.
P7.11 A computer system requires a high-performance 
magnetic tape transport system [17]. The environmen￾tal conditions imposed on the system result in a se￾vere test of control engineering design. A direct-drive 
DC motor system for the magnetic tape reel system is 
shown in Figure P7.11, where r equals the reel radius, 
and J equals the reel and rotor inertia. A complete re￾versal of the tape reel direction is required in 6 ms, and 
the tape reel must follow a step command in 3 ms or less. 
The tape is normally operating at a speed of 100 in/s.

P7.12 A precision speed control system (Figure P7.12) is 
required for a platform used in gyroscope and inertial 
system testing where a variety of closely controlled 
speeds is necessary. A direct-drive DC torque motor 
system was utilized to provide (1)  a speed range of 
0.01°/s to 600°/s, and (2) 0.1% steady-state error max￾imum for a step input. The direct-drive DC torque 
motor avoids the use of a gear train with its attendant 
backlash and friction. Also, the direct-drive motor 
has a high-torque capability, high efficiency, and low 
motor time constants. The motor gain constant is 
nominally Km = 1.8, but is subject to variations up to 
50%. The amplifier gain Ka is normally greater than 
10 and subject to a variation of 10%. (a) Determine 
the minimum loop gain necessary to satisfy the 
steady-state error requirement. (b) Determine the 
limiting value of gain for stability. (c) Sketch the root

roots when Ka = 40, and estimate the response to a

The looper is an arm 2 to 3 feet long with a roller on

motor [18]. The typical speed of the strip passing the 
looper is 2000 ft/min. A voltage proportional to the 
looper position is compared with a reference voltage 
and integrated where it is assumed that a change in 
looper position is proportional to a change in the steel

P7.18 A feedback control system is shown in Figure P7.18. 
The filter G s c( ) is often called a compensator, and the 
design problem involves selecting the parameters α

so that the time to settle (to within 2% of the final 
value) is Ts ≤ 4 s, and the damping ratio of the domi￾nant roots is ζ > 0.6.

Sketch a root locus and determine a suitable gain 
Ka so that the damping ratio of the complex roots is 
ζ > 0.707.
P7.20 Determine the root sensitivity for the dominant 
roots of the design for Problem P7.18 for the gain 
K = 4 / α β and the pole s = −2.
P7.21 Determine the root sensitivity of the dominant 
roots of the power system of Problem P7.7. Evaluate 
the sensitivity for variations of (a) the poles at s = −4,
and (b) the feedback gain, 1/R.
P7.22 Determine the root sensitivity of the dominant 
roots of Problem P7.1(a) when K is set so that the 
damping ratio of the unperturbed roots is ζ = 0.707. 
Evaluate and compare the sensitivity as a function 
of the poles and zeros of the loop transfer function 
L s( ) = G s c( )G s( ).
P7.23 Repeat Problem P7.22 for the loop transfer func￾tion L s( ) = G s c( )G s( ) of Problem P7.1(c).
P7.24 For systems of relatively high degree, the form of 
the root locus can often assume an unexpected pat￾tern. The root loci of four different feedback systems 
of third order or higher are shown in Figure P7.24. The 
open-loop poles and zeros of KG( )s are shown, and 
the form of the root loci as K varies from zero to infin￾ity is presented. Verify the diagrams of Figure P7.24 by 
constructing the root loci.
P7.25 Solid-state integrated electronic circuits are com￾posed of distributed R and C elements. Therefore, 
feedback electronic circuits in integrated circuit form 
must be investigated by obtaining the transfer func￾tion of the distributed RC networks. It has been shown 
that the slope of the attenuation curve of a distributed 
RC network is 10n dB/decade, where n is the order of

P7.28 To meet current U.S. emissions standards for 
automobiles, hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monox￾ide (CO) emissions are usually controlled by a cata￾lytic converter in the automobile exhaust. Federal 
standards for nitrogen oxides x (NO ) emissions are 
met mainly by exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR) 
techniques.
Although many schemes are under investiga￾tion for meeting the emissions standards for all three 
emissions, one of the most promising employs a three￾way catalyst—for HC, CO, and NOx emissions—
in conjunction with a closed-loop engine-control 
system. The approach is to use a closed-loop en￾gine control, as shown in Figure P7.28 [19, 23]. The 
exhaust-gas sensor gives an indication of a rich or 
lean exhaust and compares it to a reference. The 
difference signal is processed by the controller, 
and the output of the controller modulates the 
vacuum level in the carburetor to achieve the best 
air–fuel ratio for proper operation of the catalytic 
converter. The loop transfer function is repre￾sented by

P7.31 The development of high-speed aircraft and mis￾siles requires information about aerodynamic param￾eters prevailing at very high speeds. Wind tunnels are 
used to test these parameters. These wind tunnels are 
constructed by compressing air to very high pressures 
and releasing it through a valve to create a wind. Since 
the air pressure drops as the air escapes, it is neces￾sary to open the valve wider to maintain a constant 
wind speed. Thus, a control system is needed to adjust 
the valve to maintain a constant wind speed. The loop

P7.39 High-speed trains for U.S. railroad tracks must tra￾verse twists and turns. In conventional trains, the axles 
are fixed in steel frames called trucks. The trucks pivot 
as the train goes into a curve, but the fixed axles stay 
parallel to each other, even though the front axle tends 
to go in a different direction from the rear axle [24]. 
If the train is going fast, it may jump the tracks. One 
solution uses axles that pivot independently. To coun￾terbalance the strong centrifugal forces in a curve, the 
train also has a computerized hydraulic system that 
tilts each car as it rounds a turn. On-board sensors cal￾culate the train’s speed and the sharpness of the curve 
and feed this information to hydraulic pumps under 
the floor of each car. The pumps tilt the car up to eight 
degrees, causing it to lean into the curve like a race car 
on a banked track.
 The tilt control system is shown in Figure P7.39.

DP7.1 A high-performance aircraft, shown in Figure 
DP7.1(a), uses the ailerons, rudder, and elevator to 
steer through a three-dimensional flight path [20]. The

Figure DP7.1(b).

DP7.3 A rover vehicle has been designed for maneuver￾ing at 0.25 mph over Martian terrain. Because Mars 
is 189 million miles from Earth, and it would take up 
to 40 minutes each way to communicate with Earth 
[22, 27], the rover must act independently and reli￾ably. Resembling a cross between a small flatbed truck 
and an elevated jeep, the rover is constructed of three 
articulated sections, each with its own two indepen￾dent, axle-bearing, one-meter conical wheels. A pair 
of sampling arms—one for chipping and drilling, the 
other for manipulating fine objects—extend from its 
front end like pincers. The control of the arms can 
be represented by the system shown in Figure DP7.3. 
(a) Sketch the root locus for K, and identify the roots 
for K = 2 and 25. (b) Determine the gain K that re￾sults in a percent overshoot to a step of P.O. = 1%. (c) 
Determine the gain that minimizes the settling time 
(with a 2% criterion) while maintaining a percent

Determine the actual response of the system, and 
compare it to the predicted response.

the controller so that (a) the percent overshoot for a 
step input is P O. . ≤ 5%; (b) the settling time (with a

DP7.8 Most commercial op-amps are designed to be uni￾ty-gain stable [26]. That is, they are stable when used in a

lane transitions. It also prevents yaw, which is the 
swaying of the rear end during sudden movements. 
Furthermore, the four-wheel-steering system gives 
a car increased maneuverability. This enables the 
driver to park the car in extremely tight quarters. With 
additional closed-loop computer operating systems, a 
car could be prevented from sliding out of control in 
abnormal icy or wet road conditions.
The system works by moving the rear wheels rela￾tive to the front-wheel-steering angle. The control sys￾tem takes information about the front wheels’ steer￾ing angle and passes it to the actuator in the back. This 
actuator then moves the rear wheels appropriately.
When the rear wheels are given a steering angle 
relative to the front ones, the vehicle can vary its lat￾eral acceleration response according to the loop trans￾fer function

where λ = / 2 1 q q ( ) − , and q is the ratio of rear wheel 
angle to front wheel steering angle [14]. We will as￾sume that T T 1 2 = = 1 second and ωn = 4. Design 
a unity feedback system, selecting an appropriate set 
of parameters ( ) λ ζ , K,  so that the steering control 
response is rapid and yet will yield modest overshoot 
characteristics. In addition, q must be between 0 and 1.

1500, and 2500. Predict the overshoot, settling time 
(with a 2% criterion), and steady-state error for a step 
input, assuming dominant roots. (c) Determine the ac￾tual time response for a step input for the three values

DP7.13 The automatic control of an airplane is one example 
that requires multiple-variable feedback methods. In this 
system, the attitude of an aircraft is controlled by three 
sets of surfaces: elevators, a rudder, and ailerons, as shown 
in Figure DP7.13(a). By manipulating these surfaces, a 
pilot can set the aircraft on a desired flight path [20].
An autopilot, which will be considered here, 
is an automatic control system that controls the roll 
angle φ( )t by adjusting aileron surfaces. The deflec￾tion of the aileron surfaces by an angle θ( )t generates 
a torque due to air pressure on these surfaces. This 
causes a rolling motion of the aircraft. The aileron 
surfaces are controlled by a hydraulic actuator with a 
transfer function 1/s.

The actual roll angle φ( )t is measured and com￾pared with the input. The difference between the de￾sired roll angle t φd ( ) and the actual angle φ( )t will 
drive the hydraulic actuator, which in turn adjusts the 
deflection of the aileron surface.

PREVIEW
In this chapter, we consider the steady-state response of a system to a sinusoidal 
input test signal. We will see that the response of a linear constant coefficient sys￾tem to a sinusoidal input signal is an output sinusoidal signal at the same frequency 
as the input. However, the magnitude and phase of the output signal differ from 
those of the input sinusoidal signal, and the amount of difference is a function of 
the input frequency. Thus, we will be investigating the steady-state response of the 
system to a sinusoidal input as the frequency varies.
We will examine the transfer function G s( ) when s j = ω and develop meth￾ods for graphically displaying the complex number G j ( ) ω as ω varies. The Bode 
plot is one of the most powerful graphical tools for analyzing and designing control 
systems, and we will cover that subject in this chapter. We will also consider polar 
plots and log-magnitude and phase diagrams. We will develop several time-domain 
performance measures in terms of the frequency response of the system, as well as 
introduce the concept of system bandwidth. The chapter concludes with a frequency 
response analysis of the Sequential Design Example: Disk Drive Read System.

8.1 INTRODUCTION
A very practical and important approach to the analysis and design of a system is 
the frequency response method.
The frequency response of a system is defined as the steady-state response of 
the system to a sinusoidal input signal. The sinusoid is a unique input signal, 
and the resulting output signal for a linear system is sinusoidal in the steady 
state; it differs from the input only in amplitude and phase angle.
For example, consider the system Y s( ) = T s( )R s( ) with r t( ) = A t  sin  . ω We 
have

Thus, the steady-state output signal depends only on the magnitude and phase 
of T j ( ) ω at a specific frequency ω. The steady-state response, as described in 
Equation (8.1), is true only for stable systems, T s( ).
M08_DORF2374_14_GE_C08.indd 546 26/08/2021 18:49Section 8.1 Introduction 547
One advantage of the frequency response method is the ready availability of 
sinusoid test signals for various ranges of frequencies and amplitudes. Thus, the 
experimental determination of the system frequency response is easily accom￾plished. The unknown transfer function of a system can often be deduced from the 
experimentally determined frequency response of a system [1, 2]. Furthermore, the 
design of a system in the frequency domain provides the designer with control of 
the bandwidth of a system, as well as some measure of the response of the system to 
undesired noise and disturbances.
A second advantage of the frequency response method is that the transfer func￾tion describing the sinusoidal steady-state behavior of a system can be obtained 
by replacing s with jω in the system transfer function T s( ). The transfer function 
representing the sinusoidal steady-state behavior of a system is then a function of 
the complex variable jω and is itself a complex function T j ( ) ω that possesses a 
magnitude and phase angle. The magnitude and phase angle of T j ( ) ω are readily 
represented by graphical plots that provide significant insight into the analysis and 
design of control systems.
The basic disadvantage of the frequency response method for analysis and de￾sign is the indirect link between the frequency and the time domain. Direct cor￾relations between the frequency response and the corresponding transient response 
characteristics are somewhat tenuous, and in practice the frequency response char￾acteristic is adjusted by using various design criteria that will normally result in a 
satisfactory transient response.

The Fourier transform exists for f t( ) when
f t dt . ∫ ( ) < ∞ −∞
∞
The Fourier and Laplace transforms are closely related, as we can see by exam￾ining Equations (8.2) and (8.4). When the function f t( ) is defined only for t ≥ 0, as 
is often the case, the lower limits on the integrals are the same. Then we note that 
the two equations differ only in the complex variable. Thus, if the Laplace trans￾form of a function f t 1 ( ) is known to be F s 1 ( ), we can obtain the Fourier transform 
of this same time function by setting s j = ω in F s 1( ) [3].
Again we might ask, Since the Fourier and Laplace transforms are so closely 
related, why not use the Laplace transform? Why use the Fourier transform at all? 
The Laplace transform enables us to investigate the s-plane location of the poles 
and zeros of a transfer function T s( ). However, the frequency response method 
allows us to consider the transfer function T j ( ) ω and to concern ourselves with the 
amplitude and phase characteristics of the system. This ability to investigate and 
represent the character of a system by amplitude, phase equations, and curves is an 
advantage for the analysis and design of control systems.
If we consider the frequency response of the closed-loop system, we might have 
an input that r t( ) has a Fourier transform in the frequency domain as follows:
    . ∫ ( ) ω = ( ) − ω
−∞
∞
R j r t e dt j t
Then the output frequency response of a unity feedback control system can 
be obtained by substituting s j = ω in the closed-loop system relationship, 
Y s( )  , = T s( )R s( ) so that we have
Y j T j R j G j G j
G j G j R j c

ω ω ω

Using the inverse Fourier transform, the output transient response would be

2      . 1 ∫ ω
π
( ) = = { } ( ) ( ) ω ω − ω

(8.7)
However, it is usually difficult to evaluate this inverse transform integral for all but 
the simplest systems, and a graphical integration may be used. Alternatively, as we 
will note in succeeding sections, several measures of the transient response can be 
related to the frequency characteristics and utilized for design purposes.
8.2 FREQUENCY RESPONSE PLOTS
The transfer function of a system G s( ) can be described in the frequency domain 
by the relation
G j ( ) ω ω = = G s( ) | , s j = ω R j ( ) + X( ) ω (8.8)
M08_DORF2374_14_GE_C08.indd 548 26/08/2021 18:49Section 8.2 Frequency Response Plots 549
where
R G ( ) ω ω = = Re[ ] ( ) j X and I ( ) ω ω m[G j ( )].
See the MCS website for a review of complex numbers.
Alternatively, the transfer function can be represented by a magnitude G j ( ) ω
and a phase φ ω ( ) j as
G j G j e G j j ( ) ω ω = = ( ) ( ) ω φ∠ ( ) ω , φ ω( ) (8.9)
where
X

ω
( ) ( ) ω ω ω ( )
( ) = = ( ) + ( ) −
The graphical representation of the frequency response of the system G j ( ) ω can 
utilize either Equation (8.8) or Equation (8.9). The polar plot representation of 
the frequency response is obtained by using Equation (8.8). The coordinates of the 
polar plot are the real and imaginary parts of G j ( ) ω , as shown in Figure 8.1. An 
example of a polar plot will illustrate this approach.

The first step is to determine R( ) ω and X( ) ω at the two frequencies, ω = 0 and 
ω = ∞. At ω = 0, we have R( ) ω = 1 and X( ) ω = 0. At ω = ∞, we have R( ) ω = 0
and X( ) ω = 0. These two points are shown in Figure 8.3. The locus of the real and 
imaginary parts is also shown in Figure 8.3 and is easily shown to be a circle with 
the center at ( ) ,  0 . 1
2 When ω ω = 1, the real and imaginary parts are equal in mag￾nitude, and the angle φ ω( ) = −45°. The polar plot can also be readily obtained from 
Equation (8.9) as
G j ( ) ω ω = ∠ G j ( ) φ ω( ), (8.13)

Hence, when ω ω = 1, the magnitude is G j ( ) ω1 = /1 2 and the phase φ ω( )1 = −45°.
Also, when ω approaches +∞, we have G j ( ) ω → 0 and φ ω( ) = −90°. Similarly, 
when ω = 0, we have G j ( ) ω = 1 and φ ω( ) = 0. ■

The phase angle and the magnitude are readily calculated at the frequencies

  . 2 4 2 M( ) ω ω = + ω τ Then when ω = ∞, we have R( ) ω = 0 and X( ) ω = 0. When ω = 0, we have 
R K ( ) ω τ = − and X( ) ω = −∞. When ω τ = /1 , we have R K ( ) ω τ = − /2 and 
X K ( ) ω τ = − /2, as shown in Figure 8.4.
Another method of obtaining the polar plot is to evaluate the vector G j ( ) ω

There are several possibilities for coordinates of a graph portraying the fre￾quency response of a system. As we have seen, we may use a polar plot to repre￾sent the frequency response (Equation 8.8) of a system. However, the limitations of 
polar plots are readily apparent. The addition of poles or zeros to an existing system 
requires the recalculation of the frequency response, as outlined in Examples 8.1 
and 8.2. Furthermore, calculating the frequency response in this manner is tedious 
and does not indicate the effect of the individual poles or zeros.
The introduction of logarithmic plots, often called Bode plots, simplifies the 
determination of the graphical portrayal of the frequency response. The logarith￾mic plots are called Bode plots in honor of H. W. Bode, who used them extensively 
in his studies of feedback amplifiers [4, 5]. The transfer function in the frequency 
domain is
( ) ω ω = ( ) φ ω( ) G j G j e . j (8.16)
The logarithm of the magnitude is normally expressed in terms of the logarithm to 
the base 10, so we use
Logarithmic gain 2 = 0  log , 10 G j ( ) ω (8.17)
where the units are decibels (dB). A decibel conversion table is given on the MCS 
website. The logarithmic gain in dB and the angle φ ω( ) can be plotted versus the 
frequency ω by utilizing several different arrangements. For a Bode diagram, the

plot of logarithmic gain in dB versus ω is normally plotted on one set of axes, and 
the phase φ ω( ) versus ω on another set of axes, as shown in Figure 8.6. For example, 
the Bode plot of the transfer function of Example 8.1 can be readily obtained, as we 
will find in the following example.

and at ω τ = /1 , we have
20 log G j ( ) ω = −10 log 2 = −3.01 dB.
The magnitude plot for this network is shown in Figure 8.6(a). The phase angle of 
the network is
tan . 1 φ ω( ) = − ( ) ωτ − (8.22)
The phase plot is shown in Figure 8.6(b). The frequency ω τ = /1 is often called the 
break frequency or corner frequency. ■
A linear scale of frequency is not the most convenient or judicious choice, and 
we consider the use of a logarithmic scale of frequency. The convenience of a log￾arithmic scale of frequency can be seen by considering Equation (8.21) for large 
frequencies ω τ  1 , / as follows:
20 log G j ( ) ω ω = −20 log( ) τ τ = −20 log  2 − 0 log ω. (8.23)
Then, on a set of axes where the horizontal axis is log ω, the asymptotic curve for 
ω τ  1/ is a straight line, as shown in Figure 8.7. The slope of the straight line can 
be ascertained from Equation (8.21). An interval of two frequencies with a ratio 
equal to 10 is called a decade, so that the range of frequencies from ω1 to ω2, where 
ω ω 2 1 = 10 , is called a decade. The difference between the logarithmic gains, for 
ω τ  1 , / over a decade of frequency is
20 log G j ( ) ω ω 1 2 − = 20 log G j ( ) − − 20 log( ) ω τ1 2 ( 2 − 0 log ) ( ) ω τ

that is, the slope of the asymptotic line for this first-order transfer function is 
− / 20 dB decade, and the slope is shown for this transfer function in Figure 8.7. 
Instead of using a horizontal axis of log ω and linear rectangular coordinates, it is 
easier to use semilog axes with a linear rectangular coordinate for dB and a loga￾rithmic coordinate for ω. Alternatively, we could use a logarithmic coordinate for 
the magnitude as well as for frequency and avoid the necessity of calculating the 
logarithm of the magnitude.

The frequency interval ω ω 2 1 = 2 is often used and is called an octave of frequencies.

The primary advantage of the logarithmic plot is the conversion of multiplica￾tive factors, such as ( ) jωτ + 1 , into additive factors, 20 log( ) jωτ + 1 , by virtue of the 
definition of logarithmic gain. This can be readily ascertained by considering the 
transfer function

transfer function.
Therefore, the four different kinds of factors that may occur in a transfer func￾tion are as follows:
1. Constant gain Kb
2. Poles (or zeros) at the origin ( ) jω
3. Poles (or zeros) on the real axis ( ) jωτ + 1
4. Complex conjugate poles (or zeros) [1 2 ] n n j j 2 + / ( ) ζ ω ω ω + / ( ) ω .

We can determine the logarithmic magnitude plot and phase angle for these four 
factors and then use them to obtain a Bode plot for any general form of a trans￾fer function. Typically, the curves for each factor are obtained and then added 
together graphically to obtain the curves for the complete transfer function. 
Furthermore, this procedure can be simplified by using the asymptotic approxi￾mations to these curves and obtaining the actual curves only at specific important 
frequencies.
Constant Gain Kb.The logarithmic gain for the constant Kb is
20 log  c Kb = onstant in dB,
and the phase angle is
φ ω( ) = 0.
The gain curve is a horizontal line on the Bode plot.
If the gain is a negative value, −Kb, the logarithmic gain remains 20 log  . Kb
The negative sign is accounted for by the phase angle, −180°.

The asymptotic curve for ω τ  1/ is 20 log  1 = 0 dB, and the asymptotic curve for 
ω τ  1/ is −20 log( ) ωτ , which has a slope of − / 20 dB decade. The intersection of 
the two asymptotes occurs when

or when ω τ = /1 , the break frequency. The actual logarithmic gain when ω τ = /1
is −3 dB. The phase angle is tan 1 φ ω( ) = − ( ) ωτ − for the denominator factor. The 
Bode plot of a pole factor 1 1 ( ) + ωτ − j is shown in Figure 8.9.
The Bode plot of a zero factor 1 + jωτ is obtained in the same manner as that 
of the pole. However, the slope is positive at + / 20 dB decade, and the phase angle is 
tan . 1 φ ω( ) = + ( ) ωτ −
A piecewise linear approximation to the phase angle curve can be obtained 
as shown in Figure 8.9. This linear approximation, which passes through the cor￾rect phase at the break frequency, is within 6° of the actual phase curve for all 
frequencies. This approximation will provide a useful means for readily determining 
the form of the phase angle curves of a transfer function G s( ). However, often the 
accurate phase angle curves are required, and the actual phase curve for the first-or￾der factor must be obtained via a computer program.

frequency response occurs at the resonant frequency r ω . When the damping ratio 
approaches zero, then ωr approaches ωn, the natural frequency. The resonant fre￾quency is determined by taking the derivative of the magnitude of Equation (8.33)

The frequency response curves can be evaluated on the s-plane by determining 
the vector lengths and angles at various frequencies ω along the s j = + ω-axis. For

in the s-plane, as shown in Figure 8.15(a). At ω = 0, we have G j ( ) ω = 1 and 
φ ω( ) = 0°. At ω τ = = 1 ,   0 G j ( ) ω and the phase angle of the vector from the zero 
at s j = 1 τ passes through a transition of 180°. When ω approaches ∞ = ,   G j ( ) ω 1
and φ ω( ) = 0 again. The frequency response is shown in Figure 8.15(b). ■
A summary of the asymptotic curves for basic terms of a transfer function is 
provided in Table 8.1.
In the previous examples, the poles and zeros of G s( ) have been restricted to 
the left-hand plane. However, a system may have zeros located in the right-hand s￾plane and may still be stable. Transfer functions with zeros in the right-hand s-plane 
are classified as nonminimum phase transfer functions. If the zeros of a transfer 
function are all reflected about the j ¯ ω axis, there is no change in the magnitude 
of the transfer function, and the only difference is in the phase-shift characteristics. 
If  the phase characteristics of the two system functions are compared, it can be

readily shown that the net phase shift over the frequency range from zero to infinity 
is less for the system with all its zeros in the left-hand s-plane. Thus, the transfer 
function G s 1( ), with all its zeros in the left-hand s-plane, is called a minimum phase 
transfer function. The transfer function G s 2( ), with G j 2 1 ( ) ω ω = G j ( ) and all the 
zeros of G s 1( ) reflected about the jω -axis into the right-hand s-plane, is called a 
nonminimum phase transfer function. Reflection of any zero or pair of zeros into 
the right half-plane results in a nonminimum phase transfer function.
A transfer function is called a minimum phase transfer function if all its zeros 
lie in the left-hand s-plane. It is called a nonminimum phase transfer function 
if it has zeros in the right-hand s-plane.
The two pole–zero patterns shown in Figures 8.16(a) and (b) have the same am￾plitude characteristics as can be deduced from the vector lengths. However, the 
phase characteristics are different for Figures 8.16(a) and (b). The minimum phase 
characteristic of Figure 8.16(a) and the nonminimum phase characteristic of Figure 
8.16(b) are shown in Figure 8.17. Clearly, the phase shift of
1( ) = +
+
G s s z
s p
ranges over less than 80°, whereas the phase shift of
2( ) = −
+
G s s z
s p
ranges over 180°. The meaning of the term minimum phase is illustrated by Figure 8.17. 
The range of phase shift of a minimum phase transfer function is the least possible or 
minimum corresponding to a given amplitude curve, whereas the range of the nonmin￾imum phase curve is the greatest possible for the given amplitude curve.

EXAMPLE 8.5 Sketching a Bode plot

2. A pole at the origin
3. A pole at ω = 2

First, we plot the magnitude characteristic for each individual pole and zero

1. The constant gain is 20 log 5 = 14 dB, as shown in Figure 8.19.
2. The magnitude of the pole at the origin extends from zero frequency to infinite fre￾quencies and has a slope of −20 dB/decade intersecting the 0-dB line at ω = 1, as 
shown in Figure 8.19.
3. The asymptotic approximation of the magnitude of the pole at ω = 2 has a slope of 
−20 dB/decade beyond the break frequency at ω = 2. The asymptotic magnitude 
below the break frequency is 0 dB, as shown in Figure 8.19.
4. The asymptotic magnitude for the zero at ω = +10 has a slope of 
+20 dB/decade beyond the break frequency at ω = 10, as shown in Figure 8.19.

5. The magnitude for the complex poles is −40  dB decade. The break frequency is 
ω ω = =n 50, as shown in Figure 8.19. This approximation must be corrected to the 
actual magnitude because the damping ratio is ζ = 0.3, and the magnitude differs 
appreciably from the approximation, as shown in Figure 8.20.
Therefore, the total asymptotic magnitude can be plotted by adding the asymp￾totes due to each factor, as shown by the solid line in Figure 8.20. Examining the 
asymptotic curve of Figure 8.20, we note that the curve can be obtained directly by plot￾ting each asymptote in order as frequency increases. Thus, the slope is −20  dB decade
due to 1 ( ) ω − K j intersecting 14 dB at ω = 1. Then, at ω = 2, the slope becomes 
−40  dB decade due to the pole at ω = 2. The slope changes to −20  dB decade due 
to the zero at ω = 10. Finally, the slope becomes −60  dB decade at ω = 50 due to 
the pair of complex poles at ωn = 50.
The exact magnitude curve is then obtained by using Figure 8.9, which provides 
the difference between the actual and asymptotic curves for a single pole. The single 
zero follows a similar pattern, but with actual curve +3 dB at the break frequency. 
The exact magnitude curve for the pair of complex poles is obtained by utilizing 
Figure 8.10(a) for the quadratic factor. The exact magnitude curve for G j ( ) ω is 
shown by a dashed line in Figure 8.20.
The phase characteristic can be obtained by adding the phase due to each in￾dividual factor. Usually, the linear approximation of the phase characteristic for a 
single pole or zero is suitable for the initial analysis. Thus, the individual phase char￾acteristics for the poles and zeros are shown in Figure 8.21 and are:
1. The phase of the constant gain is 0°.
2. The phase of the pole at the origin is a constant −90°.
3. The linear approximation of the phase characteristic for the pole at ω = 2 is shown in 
Figure 8.21, where the phase shift is −45° at ω = 2.
4. The linear approximation of the phase characteristic for the zero at ω = 10 is also 
shown in Figure 8.21, where the phase shift is +45° at ω = 10.

5. The actual phase characteristic for the pair of complex poles is obtained from Figure 
8.10 and is shown in Figure 8.21.
Therefore, the total phase characteristic, φ ω( ), is obtained by adding the phase 
due to each factor as shown in Figure 8.21. While this curve is an approximation, its 
usefulness merits consideration as a first attempt to determine the phase characteristic. 
Thus, a frequency of interest is the frequency for which φ ω( ) = −180°. The approx￾imate curve indicates that a phase shift of −180° occurs at ω = 46. The actual phase 
shift at ω = 46 can be readily calculated as

Then we find that
46 90° tan 23 tan 4.6 tan 3.55 175°, 1 1 1 φ( ) = − − + − − − = − − (8.44)
and the approximate curve has an error of 5° at ω = 46. However, once the 
approximate frequency of interest is ascertained from the approximate phase curve, 
the accurate phase shift for the neighboring frequencies is readily determined 
by using the exact phase shift relation (Equation 8.43). This approach is usually 
preferable to the calculation of the exact phase shift for all frequencies over several 
decades. In summary, we may obtain approximate curves for the magnitude and 
phase shift of a transfer function G j ( ) ω in order to determine the important 
frequency ranges. Then, within the relatively small important frequency ranges, 
the exact magnitude and phase shift can be readily evaluated by using the exact 
equations, such as Equation (8.43).

The Bode plot for the transfer function in Equation 8.42 is shown in Figure 8.22. 
The plot is generated for four decades, and the 0-dB line is indicated, as well as 
the −180° line. The plot indicates that the magnitude is 34 dB and that the phase is 
−92.36° at ω = 0.1. Similarly, the plot indicates that the magnitude is −43 dB and 
that the phase is −243° at ω = 100. Examining the plot, we find that the magnitude 
is 0 dB at ω = 3.0 and the phase is −180° at ω = 50. ■
8.3 FREQUENCY RESPONSE MEASUREMENTS
A sine wave can be used to measure the open-loop frequency response of a system. 
In practice, a plot of amplitude versus frequency and phase versus frequency will 
be obtained [1, 3, 6]. From these two plots, the loop transfer function G j G j c( ) ω ω ( )
can be deduced. Similarly, the closed-loop frequency response of a control system, 
T j ( ) ω , may be obtained and the actual transfer function deduced.
A device called a wave analyzer can be used to measure the amplitude and 
phase variations as the frequency of the input sine wave is altered. Also, a device 
called a transfer function analyzer can be used to measure the loop transfer function 
and closed-loop transfer functions [6].
A typical signal analyzer instrument can perform frequency response measure￾ments from DC to 100 kHz. Built-in analysis and modeling capabilities can derive 
poles and zeros from measured frequency responses or construct phase and mag￾nitude responses from user-supplied models. This device can also synthesize the 
frequency response of a model of a system, allowing a comparison with an actual 
response.
As an example of determining the transfer function from the Bode plot, con￾sider Figure 8.23. The system is a stable circuit consisting of resistors and capacitors. 
Because the magnitude declines at about −20 dB / decade as ω increases be￾tween 100 and 1,000, and because the phase is −45° and the magnitude is −3 dB at 
300 rad/s, we can deduce that one factor is a pole at p1 = 300. Next, we deduce that 
a pair of quadratic zeros exist at ωn = 2450. This is inferred by noting that the phase 
changes abruptly by nearly +180°, passing through 0° at ωn = 2,450. Also, the slope 
of the magnitude changes from −20 dB / decade to +20 dB / decade at ωn = 2,450.
Because the slope of the magnitude returns to 0 dB/decade as ω exceeds 50,000, 
we determine that there is a second pole as well as two zeros. This second pole is at

8.4 PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN
We must ask the question: how does the frequency response of a system relate to 
the expected transient response of the system? In other words, given a set of time￾domain (transient performance) specifications, how do we specify the frequency 
response? For a simple second-order system, we have already answered this ques￾tion by considering the time-domain performance in terms of overshoot, settling 
time, and other performance criteria, such as integral squared error. For the sec￾ond-order system shown in Figure 8.24, the closed-loop transfer function is

The frequency response of the closed-loop system is shown in Figure 8.25. Because this 
is a second-order system, the damping ratio of the system is related to the maximum 
magnitude Mpω, which occurs at the frequency ωr as shown in Figure 8.25.

At the resonant frequency ωr a maximum value Mpω of the frequency 
response is attained.
The bandwidth, ωB, is a measure of a ability of the system to faithfully repro￾duce an input signal.
M08_DORF2374_14_GE_C08.indd 571 26/08/2021 18:51572 Chapter 8 Frequency Response Methods
The resonant frequency ωr and the −3 dB bandwidth can be related to the 
speed of the transient response. Thus, as the bandwidth ωB increases, the rise time of 
the step response of the system will decrease. Furthermore, the overshoot to a step 
input can be related to Mpω through the damping ratio ζ. The curves of Figure 8.11 
relate the resonance magnitude and frequency to the damping ratio of the 
second-order system. With the damping ratio, the percent overshoot to a unit step 
can be computed. Thus, we find as the resonant peak Mpω increases in magnitude, 
the percent overshoot to a step input increases. In general, the magnitude Mpω indi￾cates the relative stability of a system.
The bandwidth of a system ωB, as indicated on the frequency response, can 
be approximately related to the natural frequency of the system. Figure 8.26 
shows the normalized bandwidth ω ω B n versus ζ for the second-order system of 
Equation (8.46). The response of the second-order system to a unit step input is 
of the form
( ) = +1 cos( ) ω θ 1 + . −ζω y t Be t n t (8.47)
The greater the magnitude of ωn when ζ is constant, the more rapidly the response 
approaches the desired steady-state value. Thus, desirable frequency-domain spec￾ifications are as follows:
1. Relatively small resonant magnitudes: Mpω < 1.5, for example.
2. Relatively large bandwidths so that the system time constant τ ζ = 1 ( ) ωn is sufficiently 
small.
The usefulness of the frequency response specifications and their relation to 
the actual transient performance depend upon the approximation of the system by 
a second-order pair of complex poles, called the dominant roots. If the frequency 
The bandwidth is the frequency ωB at which the frequency response has 
declined 3 dB from its low-frequency value. This corresponds to approximately 
half an octave, or about 1 2 of the low-frequency value.

response is dominated by a pair of complex poles, the relationships between the 
frequency response and the time response discussed in this section will be valid. 
Fortunately, a large proportion of control systems satisfy this dominant second-or￾der approximation in practice.
The steady-state error specification can also be related to the frequency re￾sponse of a closed-loop system. The steady-state error for a specific test input signal 
is related to the gain and number of integrations (poles at the origin) of the loop 
transfer function. Therefore, for the system shown in Figure 8.24, the steady-state 
error for a ramp input is specified in terms of Kυ, the velocity constant. The steady￾state error for the system is
( ) = →∞ υ

where A is the magnitude of the ramp input. The velocity constant for the system of

and the gain constant is Kυ for this type-one system. For example, reexamining

then the system is type N and the gain K is the gain constant for the steady-state 
error. Thus, for a type-zero system that has two poles, we have

In this equation, K K = p (the position error constant) that appears as the low-frequency

M08_DORF2374_14_GE_C08.indd 573 26/08/2021 18:51574 Chapter 8 Frequency Response Methods
Furthermore, the gain constant K K = υ for the type-one system appears as 
the gain of the low-frequency section of the magnitude characteristic. Considering 
only the pole at the origin and gain of the type-one system of Equation (8.50), 
we have

and the Kυ is equal to the magnitude when this portion of the magnitude character￾istic intersects the 0-dB line. For example, the low-frequency intersection of K j υ ω
in Figure 8.20 is equal to ω = 5, as we expect.
Therefore, the frequency response characteristics represent the performance of 
a system quite adequately, and with some experience, they are quite useful for the 
analysis and design of feedback control systems.
8.5 LOG-MAGNITUDE AND PHASE DIAGRAMS
There are several alternative methods for presenting the frequency response 
of a function G j ( ) ω . We have seen that suitable graphical presentations of the 
frequency response are (1) the polar plot and (2) the Bode plot. An alternative 
approach to portraying the frequency response graphically is to plot the logarithmic 
magnitude in dB versus the phase angle for a range of frequencies. Consider the 
log-magnitude–phase plot for the transfer function

is shown in Figure 8.28. This curve can be obtained by utilizing the Bode plots 
of Figures 8.20 and 8.21 to transfer the frequency response information to the 
log-magnitude and phase coordinates. The shape of the locus of the frequency 
response on a log-magnitude–phase diagram is particularly important as the phase 
approaches −180° and the magnitude approaches 0 dB. The locus of Equation 
(8.54) and Figure 8.27 differs substantially from the locus of Equation (8.55) and 
Figure 8.28. Therefore, as the correlation between the shape of the locus and the 
transient response of a system is established, we will obtain another useful por￾trayal of the frequency response of a system. We can establish a stability criterion 
in the frequency domain for which it will be useful to utilize the log-magnitude–
phase diagram to investigate the relative stability of closed-loop feedback control 
systems.

8.6 DESIGN EXAMPLES
In this section, we present two illustrative examples using frequency response meth￾ods to design controllers. The first example describes the control of a photovoltaic 
generator to achieve maximum power delivery as the sunlight varies over time. The 
second example considers the control of one leg of a six-legged robotic device. In 
this example, the specifications that must be satisfied include a mix of time-domain 
specifications (percent overshoot and settling time) and frequency-domain specifi￾cations (bandwidth). The design process leads to a viable PID controller meeting all 
the specifications.
EXAMPLE 8.6 Maximum power pointing tracking for photovoltaic generators
One goal of green engineering is to design products that minimize pollution and 
improve the environment. Using solar energy is one way to provide clean energy 
using photovoltaic generators converting sunlight to electricity directly. However, 
the output of a photovoltaic generator is variable and depends on the available 
sunlight, the temperature, and the attached loads. In this example, we provide a

discussion on regulating the voltage provided by a photovoltaic generator system

Consider the feedback control system in Figure 8.29. The plant transfer func￾tion is

(8.56)
where Kc, τ1, and τ2 are to be determined. The controller in Equation (8.56) is a 
lead or lag compensator depending on τ1 and τ2. The controller should minimize 
the effects of disturbances and plant changes by providing a high gain at low 
frequencies while minimizing the measurement noise by providing a low gain at 
high frequencies [24]. To accomplish these goals, the design specifications are:
1. G j G j c( ) ω ω ( ) ≥ ≤ 20 dB at  1 ω 0 rad s
2. G j G j c( ) ω ω ( ) ≤ −20 dB at  1 ω ≥ ,000  rad s
3. Phase margin P M. . ≥ 60°
The phase margin of the uncompensated system is P M. . = 36.3° implying that the 
compensated system needs to add approximately P M. . = 25°, hence the use of the 
compensator to add the required phase lead. Also, the magnitude of the uncom￾pensated frequency response at ω = 1000 rad/s is −11 dB indicating that the gain 
needs to be further reduced at high frequencies to meet the specifications.

The compensated phase margin is P M. . = 60.4°. As can be seen in Figure 8.30, 
the low-frequency, high-gain specification is satisfied, as well as the high-frequency, 
low-gain specification. The closed-loop step response is shown in Figure 8.31. The 
settling time is Ts = 0.11 s and the percent overshoot is P O. . = 19.4%, both very 
acceptable for the control of the photovoltaic generator voltage. ■

EXAMPLE 8.7 Control of one leg of a six-legged robot
The Ambler is a six-legged walking machine being developed at Carnegie-Mellon 
University [23]. An artist’s conception of the Ambler is shown in Figure 8.32.
In this example we consider the control system design for position control of 
one leg. The elements of the design process emphasized in this example are high￾lighted in Figure 8.33. The mathematical model of the actuator and leg is provided.

The variable to be controlled is
Variable to Be Controlled
Leg position, Y s( ).
We want the leg to move to the commanded position as fast as possible but with 
minimal overshoot. As a practical first step, the design goal will be to produce a 
system that moves, albeit slowly. In other words, the control system bandwidth will 
initially be low.
The control design specifications are
Control Design Specifications
DS1 Closed-loop bandwidth is ωB ≥ 1 Hz.
DS2 Percent overshoot is P O. . ≤ 15% to a step input.
DS3 Zero steady-state tracking error to a step input.
Specifications DS1 and DS2 are intended to ensure acceptable tracking perfor￾mance. Design specification DS3 is actually a nonissue in our design: the actuator/
leg transfer function is a type-one system so a zero steady-state tracking error to a 
step input is guaranteed. We need to ensure that G s c( )G s( ) remains at least a type￾one system.
Consider the controller
G s
K s as b
s c c
( ) ( ) = + +
+ .
2
(8.58)
As c → 0, a PID controller is obtained with K K P a = = ,  K K D , and K K = b. I
We can let c be a parameter at this point and see if the additional freedom in select￾ing c ≠ 0 is useful. It may be that we can simply set c = 0 and use the PID form.

The controller in Equation (8.58) is not the only controller that we can consider. 
For example, we might consider
G s K s z
s p c( ) = +
+ , (8.59)
where K, z, and p are the key tuning parameters. The design of the type of controller 
given in Equation (8.59) will be left as a design problem at the end of the chapter.
The response of a closed-loop control system is determined predominantly by 
the location of the dominant poles. Our approach to the design is to determine 
appropriate locations for the dominant poles of the closed-loop system. We can 
determine the locations from the performance specifications by using second-order 
system approximation formulas. Once the controller parameters are obtained so 
that the closed-loop system has the desired dominant poles, the remaining poles are 
located so that their contribution to the overall response is negligible.
Per specification DS1, we want
ωB = = 1 Hz 6.28  rad s. (8.60)
From the percent overshoot specification, we can determine the minimum value 
of ζ. Thus for P O. . ≤ 15%, we require ζ ≥ 0.52; therefore, we will design with 
ζ = 0.52. Even though settling time is not a design specification for this prob￾lem, we usually attempt to make the system response as fast as possible while 
still meeting all the design specifications. From Figure 8.26 and Equation (8.60) it 
follows that
1.1961 1.8508
ω 5.11  rad s.
ω
ζ = − + n = B (8.61)
Then with ωn = 5.11  rad s and ζ = 0.52 and using Equation (8.36) we compute 
ω = 3.46  rad s. r
So, if we had a second-order system, we would want to determine values of the 
control gains such that ω ζ n = = 5.11  rad s and  0.52, which yields Mp r ω = = 1.125 and ω 3.46  rad s.
Mp r ω = = 1.125 and ω 3.46  rad s.
Our closed-loop system is a fourth-order system and not a second-order system. 
So, a valid design approach would be to select K, a, b, and c so that two poles are 
dominant and located appropriately to meet the design specifications. This will be 
the approach followed here.
Another valid approach is to develop a second-order approximation of the 
fourth-order system. In the approximate transfer function, the parameters K, a, b, 
and c are left as variables. The objective would be to obtain an approximate transfer 
function T s L ( ) in such a way that the frequency response of T s L ( ) is very close to 
that of the original system.

The associated characteristic equation is
2 10 2 10 0. 4 3 2 s c + + ( )s c + + ( ) + + K s ( ) c K + + a s Kb = (8.63)
The desired characteristic polynomial must also be fourth-order, but we want it to 
be composed of multiple factors, as follows:
2 , 2 2 2 P s d n ( ) = + ( ) s s ζω + + ωn ( ) s d1 0 s d +
where ζ and ωn are selected to meet the design specifications, and the roots of 
2 0 2 2 s s + + ζωn n ω = are the dominant roots. Conversely we want the roots of 
0 2s d + + 1 0 s d = to be the nondominant roots. The dominant roots should lie on 
a vertical line in the complex plane defined by the distance s = −ζωn away from 
the imaginary axis. Let
d1 = 2 . αζωn
Then the roots of 0, 2s d + + 1 0 s d = when complex or equal, lie on a vertical line 
in the complex plane defined by s = −αζωn. By choosing α > 1, we effectively 
move the roots to the left of the dominant roots. The larger we select α, the further 
the nondominant roots lie to the left of the dominant roots. A reasonable value of 
α is α = 12. Also, if we select
0 , 2 2 2 d = α ζ ωn
then we obtain two real roots
0. 2 1 0
2 s d + +s d = + ( ) s αζωn =
Choosing 0 2 2 2 d = α ζ ωn is not required, but this seems to be a reasonable choice 
since we would like the contribution of the nondominant roots to the overall 
response to be quickly fading and nonoscillatory.
The desired characteristic polynomial is then
2 1 (1 4 ) 4 3 2 2 2 s s + + ζωn n ( ) α ω + + αζ ( ) α + s (8.64)
2 1 0. 3 2 2 2 4 + + αζω ζ n n ( ) α α s + = ζ ω
Equating the coefficients of Equations (8.63) and (8.64) yields four relationships 
involving K, a, b, c, and α:
2 1 ζωn ( ) + = α 2 , + c
1 4 10 2 , 2 2 ω α n ( ) + + ζ α ( ) = + c K +
2 1 10 , 3 2 αζω ζ n ( ) + = α c K + a

4 = Kb
M08_DORF2374_14_GE_C08.indd 581 26/08/2021 18:51582 Chapter 8 Frequency Response Methods
In our case ζ ω = = 0.52,   n 5.11, and α = 12. Thus we obtain
c = 67.13
K = 1239.2
a = 5.17
b = 21.48

The step response of the closed-loop system using the controller in Equation (8.65) 
is shown in Figure 8.35. The percent overshoot is P O. . = 14%, and the settling time 
is T = 0.96 s. s
The magnitude plot of the closed-loop system is shown in Figure 8.36. The 
bandwidth is ωB = = 27.2  rad s 4.33 Hz. This satisfies DS1 but is larger than the 
ωB = 1 Hz used in the design (due to the fact that our system is not a second-order 
system). The higher bandwidth leads us to expect a faster settling time. The peak 
magnitude is Mpω = 1.21. We were expecting Mpω = 1.125.
What is the steady-state response of the closed-loop system if the input is a sinu￾soidal input? From our previous discussions we expect that as the input frequency 
increases, the magnitude of the output will decrease. Two cases are presented 
here. In Figure 8.37 the input frequency is ω = 1 rad s. The output magnitude is 
approximately equal to 1 in the steady state. In Figure 8.38 the input frequency 
is ω = 500  rad s. The output magnitude is less than 0.005 in the steady state.

This verifies our intuition that the system response decreases as the input sinusoidal 
frequency increases.
Using simple analytic methods, we obtained an initial set of controller parame￾ters for the mobile robot. The controller thus designed proved to satisfy the design 
requirements. Some fine-tuning would be necessary to meet the design specifica￾tions exactly. ■

8.7 FREQUENCY RESPONSE METHODS USING CONTROL DESIGN SOFTWARE
In this section, we cover the functions bode and logspace. The bode function is 
used to generate a Bode plot, and the logspace function generates a logarithmically 
spaced vector of frequencies utilized by the bode function.
Consider the transfer function

1 0.5 (1 0.6 50 1 / 50 )
. = 2 2
+
+ + ( ) / + ( )
( )
( ) ( ) (8.66)
The Bode plot corresponding to Equation (8.66) is shown in Figure 8.39. The plot con￾sists of the logarithmic gain in dB versus ω in one plot and the phase φ ω( ) in degrees 
versus ω in rad/s in a second plot. As with the root locus plots, it will be tempting to rely 
exclusively on control design software to obtain the Bode plots. The software should be 
treated as one tool in a tool kit that can be used to design and analyze control systems. 
It is essential to develop the capability to obtain approximate Bode plots manually. 
There is no substitute for a clear understanding of the underlying theory.
A Bode plot is obtained with the bode function shown in Figure 8.40. The 
Bode plot is automatically generated if the bode function is invoked without left￾hand arguments. Otherwise, the magnitude and phase characteristics are placed 
in the workspace through the variables mag and phase. A Bode plot can then be 
obtained with the plot or semilogx function using mag, phase, and ω. The vec￾tor ω contains the values of the frequency in rad/s at which the Bode plot will 
be calculated. If ω is not specified, the bode function will automatically choose the 
frequency values by placing more points in regions where the frequency response 
is changing quickly. If the frequencies are specified explicitly, it is desirable 
to generate the vector ω using the logspace function. The logspace function is 
shown in Figure 8.41.
ω = 500 rad/s.

The bode function automatically selected the frequency range. This range is user 
selectable using the logspace function. The bode function can be used with a state 
variable model, as shown in Figure 8.43. The use of the bode function is exactly the 
same as with transfer functions, except that the input is a state-space object instead 
of a transfer function object.

Keep in mind that our goal is to design control systems that satisfy certain per￾formance specifications given in the time domain. Thus, we must establish a connec￾tion between the frequency response and the transient time response of a system. 
The relationship between specifications given in the time domain to those given in 
the frequency domain depends upon approximation of the system by a second-order 
system with the poles being the system dominant roots.
Consider the second-order system shown in Figure 8.24. The Bode plot mag￾nitude characteristic associated with the closed-loop transfer function in Equation 
(8.46) is shown in Figure 8.25. The relationship between the resonant frequency, 
r ω , the maximum of the frequency response, Mpω, and the damping ratio, ζ, and 
the natural frequency, ωn, is shown in Figure 8.44 (and in Figure 8.11). The infor￾mation in Figure 8.44 will be quite helpful in designing control systems in the fre￾quency domain while satisfying time-domain specifications.
EXAMPLE 8.8 Engraving machine system
Engraving machines employ two drive motors and associated lead screws to posi￾tion the engraving scribe in the desired direction [7]. The block diagram model for 
the position control system is shown in Figure 8.45. Our objective is to select K so 
that the closed-loop system has an acceptable time response to a step command. A 
functional block diagram describing the frequency-domain design process is shown 
in Figure 8.46. First, we choose K = 2 and then iterate K if the performance is 
unacceptable. The script shown in Figure 8.47 is used in the design. The value of K is 
defined at the command level. Then the script is executed and the closed-loop Bode 
plot is generated. The values of Mpω and ωr are determined by inspection from 
the Bode plot. Those values are used in conjunction with Figure 8.44 to determine 
the corresponding values of ζ and ωn.

Given the damping ratio, ζ, and the natural frequency, ωn, the settling time 
and percent overshoot can be estimated. If the time-domain specifications are not 
satisfied, then we adjust K and iterate.
The values for ζ and ωn corresponding to K = 2 are ζ = 0.29 and ωn = 0.88.
This leads to a prediction of P O. . = 37% and T = 15.7 s. s The step response, shown 
in Figure 8.48, is a verification that the performance predictions are quite accurate 
and that the closed-loop system performs adequately.
In this example, the second-order system approximation is reasonable and leads 
to an acceptable design. However, the second-order approximation may not always 
lead directly to a good design. Fortunately, the control design software allows us to 
construct an interactive design facility to assist in the design process by reducing the 
manual computational loads while providing easy access to a host of classical and 
modern control tools. ■
8.8 SEQUENTIAL DESIGN EXAMPLE: DISK DRIVE READ SYSTEM
The disk drive uses a flexure suspension to hold the reader head mount. This flex￾ure may be modeled by a spring and mass. In this chapter, we will include the effect 
of the flexure within the model of the motor-load system [22].
We model the flexure with the mounted head as a mass M, a spring k, and 
a sliding friction b, as shown in Figure 8.49. Here, we assume that the force u t( )
is exerted on the flexure by the arm. The transfer function of a spring-mass￾damper is

A typical flexure and head has ζ = 0.3 and a natural resonance at fn = 3000 Hz.
Therefore, 18.85 103 ωn = × as shown in the model of the system (see Figure 8.50).
First, we sketch the magnitude characteristics for the open-loop Bode diagram. 
The Bode plot of the loop transfer function with K = 400 is shown in Figure 8.51. 
Note that the actual plot has a 10-dB gain (over the asymptotic plot) at the reso￾nance ω ω = n, as shown in the sketch. Note the resonance at ωn. Clearly, we wish 
to avoid exciting this resonance.
Plots of the magnitude of the loop transfer function and the closed-loop trans￾fer function are shown in Figure 8.52. The bandwidth of the closed-loop system

of this system where ζ  0.8 and ω ω n B  = 2000  rad s. Therefore, we expect 
Ts = 2.5 ms for the system of Figure 8.50. As long as K ≤ 400, the resonance is

8.9 SUMMARY
In this chapter, we considered the representation of a feedback control system by its 
frequency response characteristics. The frequency response of a system was defined 
as the steady-state response of the system to a sinusoidal input signal. Several alter￾native forms of frequency response plots were considered. They included the polar 
plot of the frequency response and logarithmic plots, often called Bode plots. The 
value of the logarithmic measure was also illustrated. The ease of obtaining a Bode 
M08_DORF2374_14_GE_C08.indd 591 26/08/2021 18:52592 Chapter 8 Frequency Response Methods
plot for the various factors of G j ( ) ω was noted. The asymptotic approximation for 
sketching the Bode plot simplifies the computation considerably. A summary of fif￾teen typical Bode plots is shown in Table 8.2. Several performance specifications in 
the frequency domain were discussed; among them were the maximum magnitude 
Mpω and the resonant frequency r ω . The relationship between the Bode plot and 
the system error constants (Kp and Kυ ) was noted. Finally, the log-magnitude versus 
phase diagram was considered for graphically representing the frequency response 
of a system.

P8.11 Automatic steering of a ship is a particularly use￾ful application of feedback control theory [20]. In the 
case of heavily traveled seas, it is important to main￾tain the motion of the ship along an accurate track. 
An automatic system is more likely to maintain a 
smaller error from the desired heading than a helms￾man who recorrects at infrequent intervals. A mathe￾matical model of the steering system has been devel￾oped for a ship moving at a constant velocity and for 
small deviations from the desired track. For a large 
tanker, the transfer function of the ship is

where E s( ) is the Laplace transform of the deviation

Laplace transform of the angle of deflection of the 
steering rudder. Verify that the Bode plot of G j ( ) ω is 
that shown in Figure P8.11.
P8.12 The block diagram of a feedback control system 
is shown in Figure P8.12(a). The transfer functions of 
the blocks are represented by the frequency response 
curves shown in Figure P8.12(b). (a) When G3 is dis￾connected from the system, determine the damping 
ratio ζ of the system. (b) Connect G3 and determine 
the damping ratio ζ. Assume that the systems have 
minimum phase transfer functions.
P8.13 A position control system may be constructed by 
using an AC motor and AC components, as shown 
in Figure P8.13. The syncro and control transformer 
may be considered to be a transformer with a rotat￾ing winding. The syncro position detector rotor turns 
with the load through an angle . θ0 The syncro motor 
is energized with an AC reference voltage, for exam￾ple, 115 volts, 60 Hz. The input signal or command is 
R s( ) = θin ( )s and is applied by turning the rotor of 
the control transformer. The AC two-phase motor 
operates as a result of the amplified error signal. The 
advantages of an AC control system are (1) freedom 
from DC drift effects and (2) the simplicity and ac￾curacy of AC components. To measure the open-loop 
frequency response, we simply disconnect X from Y
and X′ from Y′ and then apply a sinusoidal modu￾lation signal generator to the Y Y − ′ terminals and 
measure the response at X X − ′. (The error ( ) θ θ 0 − i
will be adjusted to zero before applying the AC gen￾erator.) The resulting frequency response of the loop 
transfer function L j ( ) ω is shown in Figure P8.13(b). 
Determine the loop transfer function. Assume that 
the system has a minimum phase transfer function.

P8.18 Remote operation plays an important role in hos￾tile environments. Research engineers have been 
trying to improve teleoperations by feeding back 
rich sensory information acquired by the robot to the 
operator with a sensation of presence. This concept is 
called tele-existence or telepresence [9].
The tele-existence system consists of a system 
with a visual and auditory sensation of presence, a 
computer control system, and an anthropomorphic 
robot mechanism with an arm having seven degrees 
of freedom and a locomotion mechanism. The oper￾ator’s head movement, right arm movement, right 
hand movement, and other auxiliary motion are 
measured. A specially designed stereo visual and au￾ditory input system mounted on the neck mechanism 
of the robot gathers visual and auditory information 
from the remote environment. These pieces of infor￾mation are fed back and are applied to the specially 
designed stereo display system to evoke the sensa￾tion of presence of the operator. The locomotion 
control system has the loop transfer function

concept called a free-flying robot [9, 13]. A major 
characteristic of space robots, which clearly distin￾guishes them from robots operated on earth, is the 
lack of a fixed base. Any motion of the manipulator 
arm will induce reaction forces and moments in the 
base, which disturb its position and attitude.

P8.21 Low-altitude wind shear is a major cause of air carrier 
accidents in the United States. Most of these accidents 
have been caused by either microbursts (small-scale, 
low-altitude, intense thunderstorm downdrafts that im￾pact the surface and cause strong divergent outflows of 
wind) or by the gust front at the leading edge of expand￾ing thunderstorm outflows. A microburst encounter is a 
serious problem for either landing or departing aircraft, 
because the aircraft is at low altitudes and is traveling at 
just over 25% above its stall speed [12].
The design of the control of an aircraft encoun￾tering wind shear after takeoff may be treated as a 
problem of stabilizing the climb rate about a desired 
value of the climb rate. The resulting controller uses 
only climb rate information.

DP8.1 Understanding the behavior of a human steering 
an automobile remains an interesting subject [14, 15, 
16, 21]. The design and development of systems for 
four-wheel steering, active suspensions, active, inde￾pendent braking, and “drive-by-wire” steering pro￾vide the engineer with considerably more freedom 
in altering vehicle-handling qualities than existed in 
the past.
The vehicle and the driver are represented by 
the model in Figure DP8.1, where the driver develops 
anticipation of the vehicle deviation from the cen￾ter line. For K = 1, obtain the Bode plot of (a) the 
loop transfer function L s G s G s ( ) = c( ) ( ) and (b) the 
closed-loop transfer function T s( ). (c) Repeat parts 
(a) and (b) when K = 50. (d) A driver can select 
the gain K. Determine the appropriate gain so that 
M ω ≤ 2, p and the bandwidth is the maximum attain￾able for the closed-loop system. (e) Determine the 
steady-state error of the system for a ramp input 
r t( ) = t.
DP8.2 The unmanned exploration of planets requires a 
high level of autonomy because of the communica￾tion delays between robots in space and their Earth￾based stations. This affects all the components of the 
system: planning, sensing, and mechanism. In particu￾lar, such a level of autonomy can be achieved only if 
each robot has a perception system that can reliably 
build and maintain models of the environment. The 
perception system is a major part of the development

DP8.2(a), being developed at NASA Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory  [18]. The control system of one leg is 
shown in Figure DP8.2(b).

DP8.3 A table is used to position vials under a dis￾penser head, as shown in Figure DP8.3(a). The 
objective is speed, accuracy, and smooth motion 
in order to eliminate spilling. The position control 
system is shown in Figure DP8.3(b). Determine a K
such that the bandwidth is maximized while keeping 
P.O. ≤ 20% to a unit step input. What is the max￾imum bandwidth, vb, when P.O. ≤ 20? Determine 
the range of K such that the closed-loop system is 
stable.
DP8.4 Anesthesia can be administered automatically 
by a control system. To ensure adequate operating 
conditions for the surgeon, muscle relaxant drugs, 
which block involuntary muscle movements, are 
administered.
A conventional method used by anesthesiolo￾gists for muscle relaxant administration is to inject 
a bolus dose whose size is determined by experience 
and to inject supplements as required. Significant 
improvements may be achieved by introducing the 
concept of automatic control, which results in a con￾siderable reduction in the total relaxant drug con￾sumed [19].

Figure DP8.4. Select a gain K so that the bandwidth of 
the closed-loop system is maximized while M ω ≤ 1.5. p

little is known in the way of mathematical mod￾els. The only information available on the plant is 
the frequency response shown in Figure DP8.5(b).

specifications: (i) the crossover frequency is be￾tween 10 rad/s and 50  rad/s; (ii) the magnitude of 
the loop transfer function is greater than 20 dB for

The design objective is to balance the pendulum

A block diagram representation of the system is de￾picted in Figure CP8.8(b). Let M M s b 10 kg,  100 kg, L g 1 m,  9.81  m s ,  5 a , = = = = 2 =

The design specifications, based on a unit step distur￾bance, are as follows:
1. settling time (with a 2% criterion) of Ts ≤ 10 s,
2. percent overshoot of P O. . ≤ 40%, and
3. steady-state tracking error less than 0.1° in the 
presence of the disturbance.
Develop a set of interactive m-file scripts to aid in the 
control system design. The first script should accom￾plish at least the following:
1. Compute the closed-loop transfer function from 
the disturbance to the output with K as an adjust￾able parameter.
2. Draw the Bode plot of the closed-loop system.
3. Automatically compute and output Mpω and r ω .
As an intermediate step, use Mpω and ωr and 
Equations (8.36) and (8.37) in Section 8.2 to estimate 
ζ and ω . n The second script should at least estimate 
the settling time and percent overshoot using ζ and 
ωn as input variables.
If the performance specifications are not satis￾fied, change K and iterate on the design using the first 
two scripts. After completion of the first two steps, the 
final step is to test the design by simulation. The func￾tions of the third script are as follows:
1. plot the response, θ( )t , to a unit step disturbance 
with K as an adjustable parameter, and
2. label the plot appropriately.
CP8.6 Consider the feedback system in Figure CP8.6. 
Obtain the Bode plots of the loop transfer function

Utilizing the interactive scripts, design the controller to 
meet the specifications using frequency response Bode 
methods. To start the design process, use analytic 
methods to compute the minimum value of K to meet 
the steady-state tracking error specification. Use the 
minimum K as the first guess in the design iteration.
CP8.9 Design a filter, G s( ), with the following frequency

3. For ω > 1000  rad ,s the magnitude 20  log10

Try to maximize the peak magnitude as close to

PREVIEW
In previous chapters, we discussed stability and developed various tools to deter￾mine stability and to assess relative stability. We continue that discussion in this 
chapter by showing how frequency response methods can be used to investigate 
stability. The important concepts of gain margin, phase margin, and bandwidth 
are developed in the context of Bode plots, Nyquist plots, and Nichols charts. A 
frequency response stability result—known as the Nyquist stability criterion—is 
presented and its use illustrated through several interesting examples. The impli￾cations of having pure time delays in the system on both stability and performance 
are discussed. We will see that the phase lag introduced by the time delay can 
destabilize an otherwise stable system. The chapter concludes with a frequency 
response analysis of the Sequential Design Example: Disk Drive Read System.

9.1 INTRODUCTION
Stability is a key characteristic of a feedback control system. Furthermore, if the 
system is stable, it is possible to investigate the relative stability. There are sev￾eral methods of determining the absolute and relative stability of a system. The 
Routh–Hurwitz method is useful for investigating the characteristic equation 
expressed in terms of the complex variable s j = +σ ω. The relative stability of a 
system can be investigated utilizing the root locus method, which is also expressed 
in terms of the complex variable s. In this chapter, we are concerned with inves￾tigating the stability of a system in the frequency domain, that is, in terms of the 
frequency response.
The frequency response of a system represents the sinusoidal steady-state re￾sponse of a system and provides sufficient information for the determination of the 
relative stability of the system. The frequency response of a system can readily be 
obtained experimentally by exciting the system with sinusoidal input signals; there￾fore, it can be utilized to investigate the relative stability of a system when the sys￾tem parameter values have not been determined. Furthermore, a frequency-domain 
stability criterion would be useful for determining suitable approaches to adjusting 
the parameters of a system in order to increase its relative stability.
A frequency domain stability criterion was developed by H. Nyquist in 1932, 
and it remains a fundamental approach to the investigation of the stability of 
linear control systems [1, 2]. The Nyquist stability criterion is based on a theorem 
in the theory of the function of a complex variable due to Cauchy. Cauchy’s theo￾rem is concerned with mapping contours in the complex s-plane, and fortunately 
the theorem can be understood without a formal proof requiring complex variable 
theory.
To determine the relative stability of a closed-loop system, we must investigate 
the characteristic equation of the system:
F s( ) = +1 0 L s( ) = . (9.1)
For the unity feedback control system of Figure 9.1, the loop transfer function is 
L s G s G s . ( ) = c( ) ( ) For a multiloop system, in terms of signal-flow graphs, the char￾acteristic equation is
F s( ) = ∆( )s L = −1   Σ +n m Σ = L Lq  0,
where ∆( )s is the graph determinant. Therefore, we can represent the character￾istic equation of single-loop or multiple-loop systems by Equation (9.1), where 
L s( ) is a rational function of s. To ensure stability, we must ascertain that all 
the zeros of F s( ) lie in the left-hand s-plane. Nyquist thus proposed a mapping 
of the right-hand s-plane into theF s( )-plane. Therefore, to use and understand 
Nyquist’s criterion, we shall first consider briefly the mapping of contours in the 
complex plane.

9.2 MAPPING CONTOURS IN THE s-PLANE
Consider the mapping of contours in the s-plane by a function F s( ). A contour map
is a contour or trajectory in one plane mapped or translated into another plane 
by a relation. Since s is a complex variable, s j = +σ ω, the function F(s) is it￾self complex; it can be defined as F s( ) = +u jv and can be represented on a 
complex F(s)-plane with coordinates u and v. As an example, let us consider a 
function F s( ) = + 2 1 s and a contour in the s-plane, as shown in Figure 9.2(a).

M09_DORF2374_14_GE_C09.indd 624 26/08/2021 19:53Section 9.2 Mapping Contours in the s-Plane 625
The mapping of the s-plane unit square contour to the F(s)-plane is accomplished 
through the relation F(s), and so
u j + =v F( )s s = + 2 1 = + 2 1 ( ) σ ωj + . (9.2)
Therefore, in this case, we have
u = + 2 1 σ (9.3)
and
v = 2 . ω (9.4)
Thus, the contour has been mapped by F s( ) into a contour of an identical form, a 
square, with the center shifted by one unit and the magnitude of a side multiplied 
by two. This type of mapping, which retains the angles of the s-plane contour on the 
F s( )-plane, is called a conformal mapping. We also note that a closed contour in the 
s-plane results in a closed contour in the F s( )-plane.
The points A, B, C, and D, as shown in the s-plane contour, map into the points 
A, B, C, and D shown in the F s( )-plane. Furthermore, a direction of traversal of the 
s-plane contour can be indicated by the direction ABCD and the arrows shown on 
the contour. Then a similar traversal occurs on the F s( )-plane contour as we pass 
ABCD in order, as shown by the arrows. By convention, the area within a contour 
to the right of the traversal of the contour is considered to be the area enclosed by 
the contour. Therefore, we will assume clockwise traversal of a contour to be pos￾itive and the area enclosed within the contour to be on the right. This convention 
is opposite to that usually employed in complex variable theory, but is equally ap￾plicable and is generally used in control system theory. We might consider the area 
on the right as we walk along the contour in a clockwise direction and call this rule 
“clockwise and eyes right.”
Typically, we are concerned with an F s( ) that is a rational function of s. 
Therefore, it will be worthwhile to consider another example of a mapping of a 
contour. Let us again consider the unit square contour for the function
F s s
s 2 ( ) = . + (9.5)
Several values of F s( ) as s traverses the square contour are given in Table 9.1, and 
the resulting contour in the F s( )-plane is shown in Figure 9.3(b). The contour in the 
F s( )-plane encloses the origin of the F s( )-plane because the origin lies within the 
enclosed area of the contour in the F s( )-plane.

M09_DORF2374_14_GE_C09.indd 626 26/08/2021 19:53Section 9.2 Mapping Contours in the s-Plane 627
Reexamining the example when F s( ) = + 2 1 ( ) s 2 , we have one zero of F s( ) at 
s = −1 2, as shown in Figure 9.2. The contour that we chose (that is, the unit square) 
enclosed and encircled the zero once within the area of the contour. Similarly, for 
the function F s( ) = + s s( ) 2 , the unit square encircled the zero at the origin but 
did not encircle the pole at s = −2. The encirclement of the poles and zeros of F s( )
can be related to the encirclement of the origin in the F s( )-plane by Cauchy’s theo￾rem, commonly known as the principle of the argument, which states [3, 4]:
If a contour Γs in the s-plane encircles Z zeros and P poles of F s( ) and does not pass 
through any poles or zeros of F s( ) and the traversal is in the clockwise direction along 
the contour, the corresponding contour ΓF in the F s( )-plane encircles the origin of 
the F s( )-plane N Z = − P times in the clockwise direction.
Thus, for the examples shown in Figures 9.2 and 9.3, the contour in the F s( )- 
plane encircles the origin once, because N Z = − P = 1, as we expect. As an￾other example, consider the function F s( ) = + s s( ) 1 2 . For the unit square 
contour shown in Figure 9.4(a), the resulting contour in the F s( ) plane is shown in 
Figure 9.4(b). In this case, N Z = − P = 0, as is the case in Figure 9.4(b), since the 
contour ΓF does not encircle the origin.
Cauchy’s theorem can be best comprehended by considering F s( ) in terms of 
the angle due to each pole and zero as the contour Γs is traversed in a clockwise 
direction. Thus, let us consider the function
F s s z s z
s p s p , 1 2
( )1 2 ( ) ( ) ( )( ) = + +
+ + (9.10)
where −zi is a zero of F s( ), and −pk is a pole of F s( ). Equation (9.10) can be 
written as
F s( ) = F s( ) F s( )
= + +

= + F s( ) ( ) φ φ z z − − φ φ p p . 1 212 (9.11)
Now, considering the vectors as shown for a specific contour Γs (Figure 9.5a), we 
can determine the angles as s traverses the contour. Clearly, the net angle change 
as s traverses along Γs (a full rotation of 360° for ,   1 2 φ φ p p , and z2 φ ) is zero degrees. 
However, for z1 φ as s traverses 360° around Γ ,s the angle z1 φ traverses a full 360° 
clockwise. Thus, as Γs is completely traversed, the net angle increase of F s( ) is 
equal to 360°, since only one zero is enclosed. If Z zeros were enclosed within Γs,
then the net angle increase would be equal to φ π z = 2 Z rad. Following this rea￾soning, if Z zeros and P poles are encircled as Γs is traversed, then 2 2 π π Z P − is 
the net resultant angle increase of F s( ). Thus, the net angle increase of ΓF of the 
contour in the F s( )-plane is simply
M09_DORF2374_14_GE_C09.indd 627 26/08/2021 19:53628 Chapter 9 Stability in the Frequency Domain
φ φ F Z = − φP,
or
2 2 π π N Z = − 2 , πP (9.12)
and the net number of encirclements of the origin of the F s( )-plane is N Z = − P.
Thus, for the contour shown in Figure 9.5(a), which encircles one zero, the contour 
ΓF shown in Figure 9.5(b) encircles the origin once in the clockwise direction.

As an example of the use of Cauchy’s theorem, consider the pole–zero pattern 
shown in Figure 9.6(a) with the contour Γs to be considered. The contour encloses 
and encircles three zeros and one pole. Therefore, we obtain
N = −3 1 = +2,
and ΓF completes two clockwise encirclements of the origin in the F s( )-plane, as 
shown in Figure 9.6(b).
For the pole and zero pattern shown and the contour Γs as shown in 
Figure 9.7(a), one pole is encircled and no zeros are encircled. Therefore, we have
N Z = − P = −1,
and we expect one encirclement of the origin by the contour ΓF in the F s( )-plane. 
However, since the sign of N is negative, we find that the encirclement moves in the 
counterclockwise direction, as shown in Figure 9.7(b).

Now that we have developed and illustrated the concept of mapping of con￾tours through a function F s( ), we are ready to consider the stability criterion pro￾posed by Nyquist.

For a system to be stable, all the zeros of F s( ) must lie in the left-hand s-plane. 
Thus, we find that the roots of a stable system (the zeros of F s( )) must lie to the left 
of the jω-axis in the s-plane. Therefore, we choose a contour Γs in the s-plane that 
encloses the entire right-hand s-plane, and we determine whether any zeros of F s( )
lie within Γs by utilizing Cauchy’s theorem. That is, we plot ΓF in the F s( )-plane 
and determine the number of encirclements of the origin N. Then the number of 
zeros of F s( ) within the Γs contour (and therefore, the unstable zeros of F s( )) is
Z N = + P. (9.14)
Thus, if P = 0, as is usually the case, we find that the number of unstable roots of the 
system is equal to N, the number of encirclements of the origin of the F s( )-plane.
The Nyquist contour that encloses the entire right-hand s-plane is shown in 
Figure 9.8. The contour Γs passes along the jω-axis from − ∞j to + ∞j , and this 
part of the contour provides the familiar F j ( ) ω . The contour is completed by a

semicircular path of radius r, where r approaches infinity so this part of the contour 
typically maps to a point. This contour ΓF is known as the Nyquist plot.
The Nyquist criterion is concerned with the mapping of the function
F s( ) = +1 L s( ) (9.15)
and the number of encirclements of the origin of the F s( )-plane. Alternatively, we 
may define the function
F s ′ = ( ) F s( )− =1 . L s( ) (9.16)
The change of functions represented by Equation (9.16) is very convenient be￾cause the loop transfer function L s( ) is typically available in factored form, while 
1 + L s( ) is not. Then, the mapping of Γs in the s-plane will be through the func￾tion F s ′ = ( ) L s( ) into the L s( )-plane. In this case, the number of clockwise 
encirclements of the origin of the F s( )-plane becomes the number of clockwise 
encirclements of the −1 point in the F s ′ = ( ) L s( )-plane because F s ′ = ( ) F s( )− 1.
Therefore, the Nyquist stability criterion can be stated as follows:
A feedback system is stable if and only if the contour ΓL in the L s( )-plane 
does not encircle the ( ) −1, 0 point when the number of poles of in the 
right-hand s-plane is zero ( ) P = 0 .
When the number of poles of L(s) in the right-hand s-plane is other than zero, 
the Nyquist criterion is stated as follows:
A feedback control system is stable if and only if, for the contourΓL, the 
number of counterclockwise encirclements of the ( ) −1, 0 point is equal to 
the number of poles of with positive real parts.
The basis for the two statements is the fact that, for the F s ′ = ( ) L s( ) mapping, 
the number of roots (or zeros) of 1 + L s( ) in the right-hand s-plane is represented 
by the expression
Z N = + P.
Clearly, if the number of poles of L s( ) in the right-hand s-plane is zero ( ) P = 0 , we 
require for a stable system that N = 0, and the contour Γp must not encircle the −1
point. Also, if P is other than zero and we require for a stable system that Z = 0,
then we must have N P = − , or P counterclockwise encirclements.

EXAMPLE 9.1 System with two real poles
A unity feedback control system is shown in Figure 9.1, where
L s K
s s 1 1 . τ τ 1 2
( ) ( )( ) = + + (9.17)
In this case, L s G s G s , ( ) = c( ) ( ) and we use a contour ΓL in the L s( )-plane. The 
contour Γs in the s-plane is shown in Figure 9.9(a), and the contour ΓL is shown in 
Figure 9.9(b) for τ τ 1 2 = = 1,   1 10, and K = 100.
The +jω-axis is mapped into the solid line, as shown in Figure 9.9. The −jω-axis
is mapped into the dashed line, as shown in Figure 9.9. The semicircle with r → ∞
in the s-plane is mapped into the origin of the L s( )-plane.
We note that the number of poles of L s( ) in the right-hand s-plane is zero, 
and thus P = 0. Therefore, for this system to be stable, we require N Z = = 0,
and the contour must not encircle the −1 point in the L s( )-plane. Examining 
Figure 9.9(b) and Equation (9.17), we find that, irrespective of the value of K, the 
contour does not encircle the −1 point, and the system is always stable for all K
greater than zero. ■

radius ε, where ε → 0. This detour is a consequence of the condition of Cauchy’s

theorem, which requires that the contour cannot pass through the pole at the origin. 
A sketch of the contour ΓL is shown in Figure 9.10(b). Clearly, the portion of the 
contour ΓL from ω = 0+ to ω = +∞ is a plot of the real and imaginary components 
of L j ( ) ω ω = + u j ( ) υ ω( ). Let us consider each portion of the Nyquist contour Γs in 
detail and determine the corresponding portions of the L s( )-plane contour ΓL.
(a) The Origin of the s-Plane. The small semicircular detour around the pole at 
the origin can be represented by setting s e j = ε φ and allowing φ to vary from −90°
at ω = 0− to +90° at ω = 0 . + Because ε approaches zero, the mapping for L s( ) is

Therefore, the angle of the contour in the L s( )-plane changes from 90° at ω = 0−
to −90° at ω = 0 , + passing through 0° at ω = 0. The radius of the contour in the 
L s( )-plane for this portion of the contour is infinite, and this portion of the contour 
is shown in Figure 9.10(b). The points denoted by A, B, and C in Figure 9.10(a) map 
to A, B, and C, respectively, in Figure 9.10(b).
(b) The Portion from ω = 0+ to ω = +∞. The portion of the contour Γs from 
ω = 0+ to ω = +∞ is mapped by the function L j ( ) ω where
L j ( ) ω = L s( ) |s j = ω (9.19)
for this part of the contour. This results in the plot with ω = 0+ to ω = +∞ shown 
in Figure 9.10(b). When ω approaches +∞, we have

(c) The Portion from ω = +∞ to ω = −∞. The portion of Γs from ω = +∞
to ω = −∞ is mapped into the point zero at the origin of the L s( )-plane by the 
function L s( ). The mapping is represented by

as φ changes from φ = +90° at ω = +∞ to φ = −90° at ω = −∞. Thus, the con￾tour moves from an angle of −180° at ω = +∞ to an angle of +180° at ω = −∞.
The magnitude of the L s( ) contour when r is infinite is always zero or a constant.
(d) The Portion from ω = −∞ to ω = 0−. The portion of the contour Γs
from ω = −∞ to ω = 0− is mapped by the function L j ( ) − ω where
L j ( ) − = ω L s( ) s j =− ω. (9.22)
Thus, we obtain the complex conjugate of L j ( ) ω , and the plot for the portion of the 
plot from ω = −∞ to ω = 0− is symmetrical to the plot from ω = +∞ to ω = 0 . +
This symmetrical plot is shown on the L s( )-plane in Figure 9.10(b).
To investigate the stability of this second-order system, we first note that the 
number of poles, P, within the right-hand s-plane is zero. Therefore, for this system 
to be stable, we require N Z = = 0, and the contour ΓL must not encircle the −1
point in the L s( )-plane. Examining Figure 9.10(b), we find that irrespective of the 
value of the gain K and the time constant τ, the contour does not encircle the −1
point, and the system is always stable. We are considering positive values of gain K. 
If negative values of gain are to be considered, we should use −K, where K ≥ 0.
We may draw two general conclusions from this example:
1. The plot of the contour ΓL for the range −∞ < < ω 0− will be the complex 
conjugate of the plot for the range 0 , + < < ω +∞ and the Nyquist plot of 
L s( ) = G s c( )G s( ) will be symmetrical in the L s( )-plane about the u-axis. 
Therefore, it is sufficient to construct the contour ΓL for the frequency range
0+ < <ω +∞ in order to investigate the stability (keeping in mind the detour 
around the origin).
2. The magnitude of L s( ) = G s c( )G s( ) as s re = jφ and r → ∞ will normally ap￾proach zero or a constant. ■

The Nyquist contour Γs is shown in Figure 9.10(a). This mapping is symmetrical for 
L j ( ) ω and L j ( ) − ω so it is sufficient to investigate the L j ( ) ω -locus. The small semi￾circle around the origin of the s-plane maps into a semicircle of infinite radius, as in 
M09_DORF2374_14_GE_C09.indd 634 26/08/2021 19:54Section 9.3 The Nyquist Criterion 635
Example 9.2. Also, the semicircle re jφ in the s-plane as r → ∞ maps into the point 
L j ( ) ω = 0, as we expect. Therefore, to investigate the stability of the system, it is 
sufficient to plot the portion of the contour ΓL that is the magnitude and phase of 
L j ( ) ω for 0 . + < < ω +∞ Thus, when s j = + ω, we have

Therefore, L j ( ) ω approaches a magnitude of zero at an angle of −270° [29]. To 
approach at an angle of −270°, the locus must cross the u-axis in the L s( )-plane, as 
shown in Figure 9.11. Thus, it is possible to encircle the −1 point. The number of en￾circlements when the −1 point lies within the locus, as shown in Figure 9.11, is equal 
to two, and the system is unstable with two roots in the right-hand s-plane. The

to ω = 0 . + The complete contour plot of ΓL is shown in Figure 9.13. Because the 
contour encircles the −1 point twice, there are two roots of the closed-loop system 
in the right-hand plane, and the system, irrespective of the gain K, is unstable. ■
EXAMPLE 9.5 System with a pole in the right-hand s-plane
Consider the control system shown in Figure 9.14 and determine the stability of the 
system. First, consider the system without derivative feedback, so that K2 = 0. We 
then have the loop transfer function

Thus, the loop transfer function has one pole in the right-hand s-plane, and there￾fore P = 1. For this system to be stable, we require N P = − = −1, one counter￾clockwise encirclement of the −1 point. At the semicircular detour at the origin of 
the s-plane, we let =∈ φ s e j when − ≤ π φ 2 2 ≤ π . Then, when =∈ , φ s e j we have

where φ varies from π 2 to −π 2 in a clockwise direction. Therefore, the contour 
ΓL, at the origin of the L s( )-plane, varies 2π rad in a counterclockwise direction. 
The contour ΓL in the L s( )-plane encircles the −1 point once in the clockwise 
direction so N = +1, and there is one pole s = 1 in the right-hand plane so P = 1.
Hence,
Z N = + P = 2, (9.38)
and the system is unstable because two roots of the characteristic equation, irre￾spective of the value of the gain K1, lie in the right half of the s-plane.
Let us now consider again the system when the derivative feedback is included

Thus, the system is stable when K K1 2 > 1. Often, it may be useful to utilize a com￾puter to plot the Nyquist plot [5]. ■

When K > 1 2, the number of encirclements of the −1 point is N = 1. The num￾ber of poles of L s( ) in the right half s-plane is P = 0. Therefore, we have
Z N = + P = 1,

that the system is unstable for all K > 1 2. ■
9.4 RELATIVE STABILITY AND THE NYQUIST CRITERION
For the s-plane, we defined the relative stability of a system as the property mea￾sured by the relative settling time of each root or pair of roots. Therefore, a system 
with a shorter settling time is considered relatively more stable. We would like to 
determine a similar measure of relative stability useful for the frequency response

method. The Nyquist criterion provides us with suitable information concerning the 
absolute stability and, furthermore, can be utilized to define and ascertain the rela￾tive stability of a system.
The Nyquist stability criterion is defined in terms of the ( ) −1,  0 point on the 
Nyquist plot or the 0-dB, −180° point on the Bode plot. The proximity of the 
L j ( ) ω -locus to this stability point is a measure of the relative stability of a system.

is shown in Figure 9.18. As K increases, the Nyquist plot approaches the −1 point and 
eventually encircles the −1 point for a gain K K = 3. We determined in Section 9.3 
that the locus intersects the u-axis at a point

As K is decreased below this marginal value, the stability is increased, and the mar￾gin between the critical gain K = + ( ) τ τ 1 2 τ τ1 2 and a gain K K = 2 is a measure of 
the relative stability. This measure of relative stability is called the gain margin and 
is defined as the reciprocal of the gain L j ( ) ω at the frequency at which the phase 
angle reaches −180° (that is, v = 0). The gain margin is a measure of the factor 
by which the system gain would have to be increased for the L j ( ) ω locus to pass 
through the u = −1 point. Thus, for a gain K K = 2 in Figure 9.18, the gain margin

The gain margin can be defined in terms of a logarithmic (decibel) measure as
d
20 log d 1 = −20 log   dB. (9.47)
For example, when τ τ 1 2 = = 1, the system is stable when K ≤ 2. Thus, when 
K K = =2 0.5, the gain margin is equal to

or, in logarithmic measure,
20 log 4 = 12 dB. (9.49)
Therefore, the gain margin indicates that the system gain can be increased by a fac￾tor of four (12 dB) before the stability boundary is reached.
The gain margin is the increase in the system gain when phase = −180° that 
will result in a marginally stable system with intersection of the −1 + j0
point on the Nyquist plot.
An alternative measure of relative stability can be defind in terms of the phase 
margin between a specific and a system that is marginally stable. The phase margin
is defined as the phase angle through which the L j ( ) ω locus must be rotated so that 
the unity magnitude L j ( ) ω = 1 point will pass through the (   −1, 0) point in the
L j ( ) ω plane. This measure of relative stability is equal to the additional phase lag 
required before the system becomes unstable. This information can be determined 
from the Nyquist plot shown in Figure 9.18. For a gain K K = 2, an additional 
phase angle, φ2, may be added to the system before the system becomes unstable. 
Similarly, for the gain K1, the phase margin is equal to φ1, as shown in Figure 9.18.
The phase margin is the amount of phase shift of the L j ( ) ω at unity 
magnitude that will result in a marginally stable system with intersection of 
the −1 + j0 point on the Nyquist plot.
The gain phase margins are easily evaluated from the Bode plot. The critical 
point for stability is u = −1,   0 υ = in the L j ( ) ω − plane, which is equivalent to a log￾arithmic magnitude of 0 dB and a phase angle of 180° (or −180°) on the Bode plot.

It is relatively straightforward to examine the Nyquist plot of a minimum-phase 
system. Special care is required with a nonminimum-phase system, however, and 
the complete Nyquist plot should be studied to determine stability.
The Bode plot associated with the loop transfer function

is shown in Figure 9.19. The phase angle when the logarithmic magnitude is 0 dB is 
equal to −137°. Thus, the phase margin is 180° − = 137° 43°. The logarithmic mag￾nitude when the phase angle is −180° is −15 dB, and therefore the gain margin is 
G M. . = 15 dB.
The frequency response of a system can be graphically portrayed on the 
logarithmic-magnitude–phase-angle diagram. For the log-magnitude–phase dia￾gram, the critical stability point is the 0-dB, −180° point, and the gain margin 
and phase margin can be easily determined and indicated on the diagram. The 
log-magnitude–phase locus of the loop transfer function, L j ( ) ω , in Equation 
(9.50) is shown in Figure 9.20. The indicated phase margin is P M. . = 43°, and the 
gain margin is G M. . = 15 dB. For comparison, the locus for

is also shown in Figure 9.20. The gain margin for L j 2 ( ) ω is G M. . = 5.7 dB, and 
the phase margin for L2 is P M. . = 20°. Clearly, the feedback system L j 2 ( ) ω is 
relatively less stable than the system L j 1 ( ) ω . However, the question still remains: 
How much less stable is the system L j 2 ( ) ω in comparison to the system L j 1 ( ) ω ?
In the following, we answer this question for a second-order system, and the gen￾eral usefulness of the relation that we develop will depend on the presence of 
dominant roots.

Let us now determine the phase margin of a second-order system and relate 
the phase margin to the damping ratio ζ of an underdamped system. Consider the

Equation (9.57) is the relationship between the damping ratio ζ and the phase mar￾gin φpm, which provides a correlation between the frequency response and the time 
response. A plot of ζ versus φpm is shown in Figure 9.21. The actual curve of ζ
versus φpm can be approximated by the dashed line shown in Figure 9.21. The slope 
of the linear approximation is equal to 0.01, and therefore an approximate linear 
relationship between the damping ratio and the phase margin is
ζ φ = 0.01 pm, (9.58)
where the phase margin is measured in degrees. This approximation is reasonably 
accurate for ζ ≤ 0.7 and is a useful index for correlating the frequency response 
with the transient performance of a system. Equation (9.58) is a suitable approxi￾mation for a second-order system and may be used for higher-order systems if we 
can assume that the transient response of the system is primarily due to a pair of 
dominant underdamped roots. The approximation of a higher-order system by a 
dominant second-order system is a useful approximation. Although it must be used

with care, control engineers find this approach to be a simple, yet fairly accurate, 
technique of setting the specifications of a control system.
Therefore, for the system with a loop transfer function, L j ( ) ω , in Equation (9.50) 
we found the phase margin P M. . = 43°. Thus, the damping ratio is approximately
ζ φ  0.01 pm = 0.43. (9.59)
Then the percent overshoot to a step input for this system is approximately
P O. . = 22%. (9.60)
It is possible to calculate and plot the phase margin and gain margin versus the gain 
K for a specified L j ( ) ω . Consider the system of Figure 9.1 with the loop transfer

in Figure  9.22(c). The phase margin and the gain margin are suitable measures 
of the performance of the system. We will normally emphasize phase margin as a 
frequency-domain specification.

The phase margin is a frequency response measure for indicating the expected 
transient performance of a system. Another useful index of performance in the 
frequency domain is Mpω, the maximum magnitude of the closed-loop frequency 
response, and we shall now consider this practical index.
9.5 TIME-DOMAIN PERFORMANCE CRITERIA IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN
The transient performance of a feedback system can be estimated from the closed￾loop frequency response. The closed-loop frequency response is the frequency re￾sponse of the closed-loop transfer function T j ( ) ω . The open- and closed-loop fre￾quency responses for a single-loop system are related. Consider the closed-loop 
system:

The Nyquist criterion and the phase margin index are defined for the loop transfer 
function L j G j G j . ( ) ω ω = c( ) ( ) ω However, as we found in Section 8.2, the maximum 
magnitude of the closed-loop frequency response can be related to the damping 
ratio of a second-order system of
2 1 , 0.707. 2

M T p r ω = = ( ) ω ζ ( ) − < ζ ζ −
(9.63)
Because this relationship between the closed-loop frequency response and the tran￾sient response is a useful one, we would like to be able to determine Mpω from the 
plots completed for the investigation of the Nyquist criterion. That is, we want to 
be able to obtain the closed-loop frequency response from the open-loop frequency 
response. Of course, we could determine the closed-loop roots of 1 + L s( ) and plot 
the closed-loop frequency response. However, once we have invested all the effort 
necessary to find the closed-loop roots of a characteristic equation, then a closed￾loop frequency response is not necessary.
The relation between the closed-loop and open-loop frequency response is il￾luminated on the magnitude-phase plot when considering unity feedback systems. 
In the unity feedback case, key performance indicators such as Mpω and ωr can be 
determined from the magnitude-phase plot using circles of constant magnitude of 
the closed-loop transfer function. These circles are known as constant M-circles.
The relationship between T j ( ) ω and L j ( ) ω is readily obtained in terms of com￾plex variables in the L s( )-plane. The coordinates of the L s( )-plane are u and υ, and 
we have
L j G j G j u j . ( ) ω ω = = c( ) ( ) ω υ + (9.64)

The radius of the circle is equal to M M / − ( ) 1 . 2 Therefore, we can plot several 
circles of constant magnitude M in the L s( )-plane. Several constant M circles are 
shown in Figure 9.23. The circles to the left of u = −1 2 are for M > 1, and the 
circles to the right of u = −1 2 are for M < 1. When M = 1, the circle becomes the 
straight line u = −1 2, which is evident from inspection of Equation (9.66).
The frequency response for a system is shown in Figure 9.24 for two gain values 
where K K 2 1 > . The frequency response curve for the system with gain K1 is tan￾gent to magnitude circle M1 at a frequency r ω 1. Similarly, the frequency response 
curve for gain K2 is tangent to magnitude circle M2 at the frequency r ω 2. Therefore, 
the closed-loop frequency response magnitude curves are estimated as shown in 
Figure 9.25. Hence, we can obtain the closed-loop frequency response of a system

from the L s( )-plane. If the maximum magnitude, Mpω, is the only information 
desired, then it is sufficient to read this value directly from the Nyquist plot. The 
maximum magnitude of the closed-loop frequency response, Mpω, is the value of 
the M circle that is tangent to the L j ( ) ω -locus. The point of tangency occurs at 
the frequency ωr, the resonant frequency. The complete closed-loop frequency re￾sponse of a system can be obtained by reading the magnitude M of the circles that 
the L j ( ) ω -locus intersects at several frequencies. Therefore, the system with a gain 
K K = 2 has a closed-loop magnitude M1 at the frequencies ω1 and ω2. This magni￾tude is read from Figure 9.24 and is shown on the closed-loop frequency response in 
Figure 9.25. The bandwidth for K1 is shown as ωB1.
It may be empirically shown that the crossover frequency ωc on the open-loop 
Bode plot is related to the closed-loop system bandwidth ωB by the approximation 
for ζ in the range 0.2 to 0.8:
ω ω B c = 1.6 . (9.69)
In a similar manner, we can obtain circles of constant closed-loop phase angles.

which is the equation of a circle with its center at u = −1 2 and υ = +1 2( ) N .
The radius of the circle is equal to 1 2[1 1 ] + N2 1 2. Therefore, the constant phase 
angle curves can be obtained for various values of N in a manner similar to the 
M circles.
The constant M and N circles can be used for analysis and design in the L s( )- 
plane. However, it is much easier to obtain the Bode plot for a system, and it would 
be preferable if the constant M and N circles were translated to a logarithmic gain 
phase. N. B. Nichols transformed the constant M and N circles to the log-magnitude–
phase diagram, and the resulting chart is called the Nichols chart [3, 7]. The M and 
N circles appear as contours on the Nichols chart shown in Figure 9.26. The coordi￾nates of the log-magnitude–phase diagram are the same as those used in Section 8.5. 
However, superimposed on the log-magnitude–phase plane we find constant M and 
N lines. The constant M lines are given in decibels and the N lines in degrees. An 
example will illustrate the use of the Nichols chart to determine the closed-loop 
frequency response.
EXAMPLE 9.7 Stability using the Nichols chart
Consider a unity feedback system with a loop transfer function in Equation (9.50). 
The frequency response of L j ( ) ω is plotted on the Nichols chart and is shown in 
Figure 9.27. The maximum magnitude, Mpω, is equal to +2.5 dB and occurs at a 
frequency ωr = 0.8. The closed-loop phase angle at ωr is equal to −72°. The 3-dB 
closed-loop bandwidth, where the closed-loop magnitude is −3 dB, is equal to 
ωB = 1.33, as shown in Figure 9.27. The closed-loop phase angle at ωB is equal 
to −142°. ■
EXAMPLE 9.8 Third-order system
Let us consider a unity feedback system with a loop transfer function
0.64
1 , 2 L s G s G s
s s s c ( ) ( ) = = ( ) ( ) + + (9.73)
where ζ = 0.5 for the complex poles. The Nichols chart for this system is shown in 
Figure 9.28. The phase margin for this system as it is determined from the Nichols 
chart is 30°. On the basis of the phase, we use Equation (9.58) to estimate the sys￾tem damping ratio as ζ = 0.30. The maximum magnitude is equal to +9 dB occur￾ring at a frequency ωr = 0.88. Therefore,
20 log Mp p ω ω = = 9 dB, or M 2.8.

Solving Equation (9.63), we find that ζ = 0.18. We are confronted with two con￾flicting damping ratios, where one is obtained from a phase margin measure and 
another from a peak frequency response measure. In this case, we have discovered 
an example in which the correlation between the frequency domain and the time 
domain is unclear and uncertain. This apparent conflict is caused by the nature of 
the frequency response which slopes rapidly toward the 180° line from the 0-dB 
axis. If we determine the roots of the characteristic equation for 1 , + L s( ) we obtain
s s 0.77 0.225s 0.826 0. 2 ( ) + + ( ) + = (9.74)
The damping ratio of the complex conjugate roots is equal to 0.124, where the com￾plex roots do not dominate the response of the system. Therefore, the real root will 
add some damping to the system, and we might estimate the damping ratio to be 
approximately the value determined from the Mpω index; that is, ζ = 0.18. A de￾signer must use the frequency-domain-to-time-domain correlations with caution. 
However, we are usually safe if the lower value of the damping ratio resulting from 
the phase margin and the Mpω relation is used for analysis and design purposes. ■
Three 
points on curve are 
shown for ω = 0.5,
0.8, and 1.35, 
respectively.

The Nichols chart can be used for design purposes by altering the frequency re￾sponse of the loop transfer fraction, L s( ) = G s c( )G s( ), so we can obtain a desirable 
phase margin and Mpω. The system gain K is readily adjusted to provide a suitable 
phase margin and Mpω by inspecting the Nichols chart. For example, let us consider 
again Example 9.8, where
1 . 2 L s G s G s K
s s s c ( ) ( ) = = ( ) ( ) + + (9.75)
The G j G j c( ) ω ω ( )-locus on the Nichols chart for K = 0.64 is shown in Figure 9.28. 
Let us determine a suitable value for K so that the system damping ratio is greater 
than 0.30. From Equation (9.63), we find that it is required that Mpω be less than 
1.75 (4.9 dB). From Figure 9.28, we find that the G j c( ) ω ω G j ( )-locus will be tangent 
to the 4.9-dB curve if the magnitude is lowered by a factor of 2.2 dB. Therefore, K
should be reduced by 1.28. Thus, the gain K must be less than 0.64 1.28 = 0.50 if the 
system damping ratio is to be greater than 0.30.

9.6 SYSTEM BANDWIDTH
The bandwidth of the closed-loop control system is an excellent measure of the 
response of the system. In systems where the low-frequency magnitude is 0 dB on 
the Bode plot, the bandwidth is measured at the −3-dB frequency. The speed of 
response to a step input will be roughly proportional to ωB, and the settling time is 
inversely proportional to ωB. Thus, we seek a large bandwidth consistent with rea￾sonable system components [12].
Consider the two second-order systems with closed-loop transfer functions

s s
100
10 100
and 900
30 900 1 . 2 2 2 ( ) = ( ) + + = + + (9.76)
Both systems have ζ = 0.5. The frequency response of both closed-loop systems is 
shown in Figure 9.29(a). The natural frequency is n 10 ω 1 = and n 30 ω 2 = for systems 
T s 1 ( ) and T s 2 ( ), respectively. The bandwidth is B 12.7 ω 1 = and B 38.1 ω 2 = for sys￾tems T s 1 ( ) and T s 2 ( ), respectively. Both systems have a P O. . = 16%, but T s 1 ( ) has a 
peak time of Tp = 0.12 s compared to Tp = 0.36 for T s 2 ( ), as shown in Figure 9.29(b). 
Also, note that the settling time for T s 2 ( ) is Ts = 0.27 s, while the settling time for 
T s 1 ( ) is Ts = 0.8 s. The system with a larger bandwidth provides a faster response.
9.7 THE STABILITY OF CONTROL SYSTEMS WITH TIME DELAYS
Many control systems have a time delay within the closed loop of the system that 
affects the stability. A time delay is the time interval between the start of an event 
at one point in a system and its resulting action at another point in the system. 
Fortunately, the Nyquist criterion can be utilized to determine the effect of the time 
delay on the relative stability of the feedback system. A pure time delay, without 
attenuation, is represented by the transfer function
G s d e , sT ( ) = − (9.77)
where T is the delay time. The Nyquist criterion remains valid for a system with a 
time delay because the factor e−sT does not introduce any additional poles or zeros 
within the contour. The factor adds a phase shift to the frequency response without 
altering the magnitude curve.
This type of time delay occurs in systems that have a movement of a material 
that requires a finite time to pass from an input or control point to an output or 
measured point [8, 9]. For example, a steel rolling mill control system is shown in 
Figure 9.30. The motor adjusts the separation of the rolls so that the thickness error 
is minimized. If the steel is traveling at a velocity υ, then the time delay between the 
roll adjustment and the measurement is
T d .
υ =
Therefore, to have a negligible time delay, we must decrease the distance to the 
measurement and increase the velocity of the flow of steel. Usually, we cannot elim￾inate the effect of time delay; thus, the loop transfer function is [10]
L s G s G s e . c sT ( ) = ( ) ( ) − (9.78)
M09_DORF2374_14_GE_C09.indd 655 26/08/2021 19:55656 Chapter 9 Stability in the Frequency Domain
The frequency response of this system is obtained from
L j G j G j e . c j T ( ) ω ω = ( ) ( ) ω − ω (9.79)
The frequency response of the loop transfer function is graphed on the Nyquist plot 
and the stability ascertained relative to the −1 point. Alternatively, we can obtain 
the Bode plot including the delay factor and investigate the stability relative to the 
0-dB, −180° point. The delay factor e−j Tω results in a phase shift

angle is in radians in Equation (9.80). An example will show the simplicity of this 
approach on the Bode diagram.
EXAMPLE 9.9 Liquid level control system
A level control system is shown in Figure 9.31(a) and the block diagram in Figure 
9.31(b) [11]. The time delay between the valve adjustment and the fluid output is 
T d = υ. Therefore, if the flow rate is 5  m s, 3 υ = and the distance is equal to 
d = 5 m, then we have a time delay T = 1 s. The loop transfer function is then
L s G s A f G s G s e sT ( ) = ( ) ( ) ( ) −
s s s s

1 30 1 9 3 1   . 2 ( )( ) ( ) ( ) = + +  + + 
 


− (9.81)
The Bode plot for this system is shown in Figure 9.32. The phase angle is shown 
both for the denominator factors alone and with the additional phase lag due to the 
time delay. The logarithmic gain curve crosses the 0-dB line at ω = 0.8. Therefore, 
the phase margin of the system without the pure time delay would be P M. . = 40°.
However, with the time delay added, we find that the phase margin is equal to 
P M. . = −3°, and the system is unstable. Consequently, the system gain must be 
reduced in order to provide a reasonable phase margin. To provide a phase mar￾gin of P M. . = 30°, the gain would have to be decreased by a factor of 5 dB, to 
K = = 31.5 1.78 17.7.
A time delay e−sT in a feedback system introduces an additional phase lag and 
results in a less stable system. Therefore, as pure time delays are unavoidable in 
many systems, it is often necessary to reduce the loop gain in order to obtain a 
stable response. However, the cost of stability is the resulting increase in the steady￾state error of the system as the loop gain is reduced. ■
The systems considered by most analytical tools are described by rational func￾tions (that is, transfer functions) or by a finite set of ordinary constant coefficient 
differential equations. Since the time-delay is given by −e , sT where T is the delay, 
we see that the time delay is nonrational. It would be helpful if we could obtain a ra￾tional function approximation of the time-delay. Then it would be more convenient 
to incorporate the delay into the block diagram for analysis and design purposes.
The Padé approximation uses a series expansion of the transcendental function 
e−sT and matches as many coefficients as possible with a series expansion of a ra￾tional function of specified order. For example, to approximate the function e−sT
with a first-order rational function, we begin by expanding both functions in a series 
(actually a Maclaurin series1

Comparing Equation (9.84) to Equation (9.82), we verify that the first three terms

9.8 DESIGN EXAMPLES
In this example, we present three illustrative examples. The first example we con￾sider is a design problem that supports green engineering and involves controlling 
the pitch angles of blades on large-scale wind turbines. The wind speeds are assumed 
to be high enough so that the pitch angle of the turbine blades can be prescribed 
properly to shed excess power to regulate the generated wind power at desired lev￾els. The second example is a remotely controlled reconnaissance vehicle control 
design. The Nichols chart is illustrated as a key element of the design of a controller 
gain to meet time-domain specifications. The third example considers the control 
M09_DORF2374_14_GE_C09.indd 659 26/08/2021 19:55660 Chapter 9 Stability in the Frequency Domain
of a hot ingot robot used in manufacturing. The goal is to minimize the tracking 
error in the presence of disturbances and a known time-delay. The design process 
is illustrated, leading to a PI controller that meets a mixture of time-domain and 
frequency-domain performance specifications.
EXAMPLE 9.10 PID control of wind turbines for clean energy
Wind energy is currently the fastest-growing energy source in the world. It is a 
cost-effective, environmentally friendly solution to energy needs. Modern wind tur￾bines are large, flexible structures operating in uncertain environments as wind di￾rection and flow constantly changes. There are many controls challenges associated 
with efficient energy capture and delivery for wind turbines. In this design prob￾lem, we consider the so-called “above-rated” operational mode of the wind turbine. 
In this mode, the wind speeds are high enough that the pitch angle of the turbine 
blades needs to be prescribed properly to shed excess power so that the generated 
wind power is regulated at desired levels. This mode of operation readily permits 
the application of linear control theory.
Wind turbines are generally constructed in either a vertical axis configuration 
or a horizontal axis configuration, as shown in Figure 9.33. The horizontal axis con￾figuration is the most common for energy production today. A horizontal axis wind 
turbine is mounted on a tower with two or three blades rotating placed atop a tall 
tower and driving an electric generator. The high placement of the blades takes ad￾vantage of the higher wind velocities. The vertical axis wind turbines are generally 
smaller and present a reduced noise footprint.
When there is sufficient wind, in order to regulate the rotor speed of the turbine 
shaft and thus the generator, the pitch of the wind turbine blades is collectively ad￾justed using a blade pitch motor, as illustrated in Figure 9.34(a). A simplified model 
of the turbine from the pitch command to the rotor speed is obtained by including 
a generator mode represented by a first-order transfer function in series with the

where K = −7000, τg = 5 s, ζg = 0.005, and ng ω = 20 rad/s. The input to the tur￾bine model is the commanded pitch angle (in radians) plus disturbances and the 
output is the rotor speed (in rpm). For commercial wind turbines, pitch control is 
often achieved using a PID controller, as shown in Figure 9.34(b). Selecting a PID 
controller requires selecting the coefficients of the controller KP, KI, and KD. The 
objective is to design the PID system for fast and accurate control. The control 
specifications are gain margin G M. . ≥ 6 dB and phase margin 30° ≤ ≤ P M. . 60°. 
The specifications for the transient response are rise time Tr 4 1 < s and time to peak 
TP < 10 s.
The output ω( )s shown in Figure 9.34 is actually the deviation from the rated 
speed of the turbine. At the rated speed, the pitch control of the blades is used to 
regulate the rotor speed. In the linear setting described by Figure 9.34, the input 
desired rotor speed ωd ( )s = 0 and the goal is to regulate the output to zero in the 
presence of disturbances.

frequency, we verify that the time to peak specification is reachable with ωn = 0.4
and ζ = 0.3. The rise time and time to peak are estimated to be

margin specifications using frequency response plots (that is, Bode plot).
The Bode plot is shown in Figure 9.35, where K K P D = 5 and K KI D = 20. 
The value of 6.22 10 K 6 D = − × − was determined by observing the effects of vary￾ing the gain on the phase and gain margins and selecting the gain that satisfied the

The dominant poles of the closed-loop feedback control system are ωn = 0.41 and 
ζ = 0.29. This is very close to the design values which demonstrates the effective￾ness of the design formulas even when the system under consideration is not a 
second-order system.
The response of the wind turbine to an impulsive disturbance is shown in 
Figure 9.37. In this numerical experiment, the disturbance (possibly a wind gust) 
imparts a step change in the wind turbine blade pitch angle. In practice, the 
disturbance would lead to varying pitch angle disturbances on the each blade, but 
for purposes of demonstration, we model this as a single step disturbance input. 
The result of the disturbance is a change on the rotor speed from the nominal that 
is brought back to zero in about 25 seconds. ■

EXAMPLE 9.11 Remotely controlled vehicle
One concept of a remotely controlled vehicle is shown in Figure 9.38(a), R s( ) and 
a proposed speed control system is shown in Figure 9.38(b). The desired speed is 
transmitted by radio to the vehicle; the disturbance T s d ( ) represents hills and rocks. 
The goal is to achieve good overall control with a low steady-state error and a 
low-overshoot response to step commands, R s( ) [13].
First, to achieve a low steady-state error for a unit step command, we calculate

The Nichols chart for K = 20 is shown in Figure 9.39. Examining the Nichols chart, 
we find that Mpω = 12 dB and the phase margin is P M. . = 15°. The step response 
of this system is underdamped, and we use Equation (9.58) to compute ζ  0.15 to 
predict an excessive overshoot of approximately P O. . = 61%.
To reduce the percent overshoot to a step input, we can reduce the gain to 
achieve a predicted overshoot. To limit the percent overshoot to P O. . = 25%, 
we  select a desired ζ of the dominant roots as 0.4 and thus require Mpω = 1.35
(from Equation (9.63)) or 20 log Mpω = 2.6 dB. To lower the gain, we will move 
the frequency response vertically down on the Nichols chart, as shown in Figure 
9.39. At ω1 = 2.8, we just intersect the 2.6-dB closed-loop curve. The reduction 
(vertical drop) in gain is equal to 13 dB, or a factor of 4.5. Thus, K = = 20 4.5 4.44.
For this reduced gain, the steady-state error is

The actual step response when K = 4.44, as shown in Figure 9.40, has an 
overshoot of P O. . = 32%. If we use a gain of 10, we have a percent overshoot of 
P O. . = 48% with a steady-state error of ess = 17%. The performance of the system 
is summarized in Table 9.2. As a suitable compromise, we select K = 10 and draw 
the frequency response on the Nichols chart by moving the response for K = 20
down by 20 log 2 6 =  dB, as shown in Figure 9.39.
Examining the Nichols chart for K = 10, we have Mpω = 7 dB, and a phase 
margin of P M. . = 26°. Thus, we estimate a ζ for the dominant roots of ζ = 0.26
which should result in an overshoot to a step input of P O. . = 43%. The actual 
response is recorded in Table 9.2. The bandwidth of the system is ωB = 5.4  rad s.
Therefore, we predict a settling time (with a 2% criterion) of

The actual settling time is approximately Ts =5.4 s, as shown in Figure 9.41. 
The steady-state effect of a unit step disturbance can be determined by using the

Thus, the unit disturbance is reduced by the factor 4 2 + K. For K = 10, we have 
y( ) ∞ = 1 24, or the steady-state disturbance is reduced to 4% of the disturbance 
magnitude. Thus we have achieved a reasonable result with K = 10.
The best compromise design would be K = 10, since we achieve a compromise 
steady-state error of ess =16.7%. If the percent overshoot and settling time are ex￾cessive, then we need to reshape the frequency response on the Nichols chart. ■
EXAMPLE 9.12 Hot ingot robot control
The hot ingot robot mechanism is shown in Figure 9.41. The robot picks up hot in￾gots and sets them in a quenching tank. A vision sensor is in place to provide a mea￾surement of the ingot position. The controller uses the sensed position information 
to orient the robot over the ingot (along the x-axis). The vision sensor provides the 
desired position input R s( ) to the controller. The block diagram depiction of the 
closed-loop system is shown in Figure 9.42. More information on robots and robot 
vision systems can be found in [15, 30, 31].
The position of the robot along the track is also measured (by a sensor other 
than the vision sensor) and is available for feedback to the controller. We assume 
that the position measurement is noise free. This is not a restrictive assumption

since many accurate position sensors are available today. For example some laser 
diode systems are self-contained (including the power supply, optics, and laser 
diode) and provide position accuracy of over 99.9%.
The robot dynamics are modeled as a second-order system with two poles at

where T = π 4  s. The elements of the design process emphasized in this example 
are highlighted in Figure 9.43. The control goal is as follows:
Control Goal
Minimize the tracking error E s( ) = − R s( ) Y s( ) in the presence of external 
disturbances while accounting for the known time-delay.
To this end the following control specifications must be satisfied:
Design Specifications
DS1 Achieve a steady-state tracking error ess ≤10% for a step input.
DS2 Phase margin P M. . ≥50° with the time-delay T = π 4  s.
DS3 Percent overshoot P O. . ≤10% for a step input.
Our design method is first to consider a proportional controller. We will show that 
the design specifications cannot be simultaneously satisfied with a proportional 
controller; however, the feedback system with proportional control provides a use￾ful vehicle to discuss in some detail the effects of the time-delay. In particular, we 
consider the effects of the time-delay on the Nyquist plot. The final design uses a PI 
controller, which is capable of providing adequate performance (that is, it satisfies 
all design specifications).
As a first attempt, we consider a simple proportional controller:

The feedback control system is shown in Figure 9.44 with a proportional controller

Solving for the appropriate gain K yields K ≥ 9. With K = 9, we obtain the Bode 
plot shown in Figure 9.45.
If we raise the gain above K = 9, we find that the crossover moves to the 
right (that is, ωc increases) and the corresponding phase margin decreases. Is a 
P M. . = 38.9° at ω = 2.8  rad s sufficient for stability in the presence of a time-delay 
of T = π 4  s? The addition of the time-delay term causes a phase lag without 
changing the magnitude plot. The amount of time-delay that our system can with￾stand while remaining stable is φ ω = − T which implies that

Solving for T yields T = 0.24 s. Thus for time-delays less than T = 0.24 s, our 
closed-loop system remains stable. However, the time-delay T = π 4  s will cause 
instability. Raising the gain only exacerbates matters, since the phase margin goes 
down further. Lowering the gain raises the phase margin, but the steady-state track￾ing error exceeds the 10% limit. A more complex controller is necessary. Before 
proceeding, let us consider the Nyquist plot and see how it changes with the addition 
of the time-delay. The Nyquist plot for the system (without the time-delay)
1 2 L s G s G s K

is shown in Figure 9.46, where we use K = 9. The number of open-loop poles of 
G s c( )G s( ) in the right half-plane is P = 0. From Figure 9.46 we see that there are no 
encirclements of the −1 point, thus, N = 0.
By the Nyquist theorem, we know that the net number of encirclements N
equals the number of zeros Z (or closed-loop system poles) in the right half-plane 
minus the number of open-loop poles P in the right half-plane. Therefore,
Z N = + P = 0.
Since Z = 0, the closed-loop system is stable. More importantly, even when the 
gain K is increased (or decreased), the −1 point is never encircled—the gain margin 
is ∞. Similarly when the time-delay is absent, the phase margin is always positive. 
The value of the P.M. varies as K varies, but the P.M. is always greater than zero.
With the time-delay in the loop, we can rely on analytic methods to obtain the 
Nyquist plot. The loop transfer function with the time-delay is

Generating a plot of Re( ) L j ( ) ω versus Im( ( L jω)) yields the plot shown in Figure 9.47. 
With K = 9, the number of encirclements of the −1 point is N = 2. Therefore, the 
system is unstable since Z N = + P = 2.
Figure 9.48 shows the Nyquist plot for four values of time-delay: T = 0, 0.1, 
0.24, and π 4 = 0.78 s. For T = 0 there is no possibility of an encirclement of the 
−1 point as K varies (see the upper left graph of Figure 9.48). We have stability 
(that is, N = 0) for T = 0.1 s (upper right graph), marginal stability for T = 0.24 s
(lower left graph), and for T = = π 4 0.78 s we have N = 1 (lower right graph), 
thus the closed-loop system is unstable.
Since we know that T = π 4 in this example, the proportional gain controller is 
not a viable controller. With it we cannot meet the steady-state error specifications 
and have a stable closed-loop system in the presence of the time-delay T = π 4.

However, before proceeding with the design of a controller that meets all the speci￾fications, let us take a closer look at the Nyquist plot with a time-delay.
Suppose we have the case where K = 9 and T = 0.1 s. The associated Nyquist 
plot is shown in the upper right of Figure 9.48. The Nyquist plot intersects (or 
crosses over) the real axis whenever the imaginary part of G j c( ) ω ω G j ( ) = 0, or

Equation (9.90) has an infinite number of solutions. The first real-axis crossing (far￾thest in the left half-plane) occurs when ω = 4.43  rad s.
The magnitude of L j ( ) 4.43 is equal to 0.0484 K. For stability we require that 
L j ( ) ω < 1 when ω = 4.43 (to avoid an encirclement of the −1 point). Thus, for

when T = 0.1. When K = 9, the closed-loop system is stable, as we already know. 
If the gain K = 9 increases by a factor of 2.3 to K = 20.67, we will be on the border 
of instability. This factor δ is the gain margin:

The system type is now equal to 1; thus we expect a zero steady-state error to a step 
input. The steady-state error specification DS1 is satisfied. We can now concentrate 
on meeting specification DS3, P O. . < 10% and DS2, the requirement for stability 
in the presence of the time-delay T = π 4  s.
From the percent overshoot specification we can determine a desired system 
damping ratio. Thus we determine for P O. . ≤ 10% that ζ ≥ 0.59. Due to the PI 
controller, the system now has a zero at s K K . = − I P The zero will not affect the 
closed-loop system stability, but it will affect the performance. Using the approxi￾mation (valid for small ζ, P.M. expressed in degrees)

we determine a good target phase margin (since we want ζ ≥ 0.59) to be 60%. We

where 1 τ = K KI P is the break frequency of the controller. The PI controller  is 
essentially a low-pass filter and adds phase lag to the system below the break frequency. 
We would like to place the break frequency below the crossover frequency so that the 
phase margin is not reduced significantly due to the presence of the PI zero.

where T = π 4. The uncompensated system phase margin is P M. . = −88.34° at 
ωc = 2.83  rad s. Since we want P M. . = 60°, we need the phase to be minus 120° 
at the crossover frequency. In Figure 9.49 we can estimate the phase φ = −120°
at ω ≈ 0.87  rad s. This is an approximate value but is sufficiently accurate for 
the design procedure. At ω = 0.87 the magnitude is about 14.5 dB. If we want the

crossover to be ωc = 0.87  rad s, the controller needs to attenuate the system gain 
by 14.5 dB, so that the magnitude is 0 dB at ωc = 0.87. With

we can consider KP to be the gain of the compensator (a good approximation for 
large ω ). Therefore,
10 0.188. 14.5 20 KP = = −( )
Finally we need to select K . I Since we want the break frequency of the control￾ler to be below the crossover frequency (so that the phase margin is not reduced 
significantly due to the presence of the PI zero), a good rule-of-thumb is to select 
1 K K 0.1 . τ ω = = I P c To make the break frequency of the controller zero one 
decade below the crossover frequency. The final value of KI is computed to be 
K K 0.1 0.0164, I c = = ω P where ωc = 0.87  rad s. Thus the PI controller is

The Bode plot of G s c G s e sT ( ) ( ) − is shown in Figure 9.50, where T = π 4. The gain

We consider whether the design specifications have been met. The steady￾state tracking specification (DS1) is certainly satisfied since our system is type one;

9.9 PID CONTROLLERS IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN
The PID controller provides a proportional term, an integral term, and a derivative 
term. We then have the PID controller transfer function as
G s K K . K
s
c P s I ( ) = + + D (9.93)
In general, we note that PID controllers are particularly useful for reducing the 
steady-state error and improving the transient response when G s( ) has one or two 
poles (or may be approximated by a second-order process).
We may use frequency response methods to represent the addition of a PID 
controller. The PID controller, Equation (9.93), may be rewritten as

a variable gain, KI. Of course, it is possible that the controller will have complex 
zeros and a Bode plot that will be dependent on the ζ of the complex zeros. The

9.10 STABILITY IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN USING CONTROL DESIGN SOFTWARE
We now approach the issue of stability using the computer as a tool. This section 
revisits the Nyquist plot, the Nichols chart, and the Bode plot in our discussions 
on relative stability. Two examples will illustrate the frequency-domain design 
approach. We will make use of the frequency response of the closed-loop transfer 
function T j ( ) ω as well as the loop transfer function L j ( ) ω . We also present an illus￾trative example that shows how to deal with a time delay in the system by utilizing a 
Padé approximation [6]. The functions covered in this section are nyquist, nichols, 
margin, pade, and ngrid.
It is generally more difficult to manually generate the Nyquist plot than the 
Bode plot. However, we can use the control design software to generate the 
Nyquist plot. The Nyquist plot is generated with the nyquist function, as shown in 
Figure 9.53. When nyquist is used without left-hand arguments, the Nyquist plot is 
automatically generated; otherwise, the real and imaginary parts of the frequency 
response (along with the frequency vector ω ) is returned. An illustration of the 
nyquist function is given in Figure 9.54.
As discussed in Section 9.4, relative stability measures of gain margin and phase 
margin can be determined from both the Nyquist plot and the Bode plot. The gain 
margin is a measure of how much the system gain would have to be increased for 
the L j ( ) ω locus to pass through the − +1 0j point, thus resulting in an unstable 
system. The phase margin is a measure of the additional phase lag required be￾fore the system becomes unstable. Gain and phase margins can be determined from 
both the Nyquist plot and the Bode plot.

FIGURE 9.55 A closed-loop control system example for Nyquist 
and Bode with relative stability.
Consider the system shown in Figure 9.55. Relative stability can be determined 
from the Bode plot using the margin function, which is shown in Figure 9.56. If the 
margin function is invoked without left-hand arguments, the Bode plot is automat￾ically generated with the gain and phase margins labeled on the plot. This is illus￾trated in Figure 9.57 for the system shown in Figure 9.55.
The script to generate the Nyquist plot for the system in Figure 9.55 is shown 
in Figure 9.58. In this case, the number of poles of L s( ) = G s c( )G s( ) with positive 
real parts is zero, and the number of counterclockwise encirclements of −1 is zero; 
hence, the closed-loop system is stable. We can also determine the gain margin and 
phase margin, as indicated in Figure 9.58.
Nichols charts can be generated using the nichols function, shown in Figure 9.59. 
If the nichols function is invoked without left-hand arguments, the Nichols chart is 
automatically generated; otherwise the nichols function returns the magnitude and

EXAMPLE 9.13 Liquid level control system
Consider a liquid level control system described by the block diagram shown in 
Figure 9.31. Note that this system has a time delay. The loop transfer function is given by

We first change Equation (9.97) in such a way that L s( ) has a transfer function form 
with polynomials in the numerator and the denominator. To do this, we can make 
an approximation to e−sT with the pade function, shown in Figure 9.61. For exam￾ple, suppose our time delay is T = 1 s, and we want a second-order approximation 
n = 2. Using the pade function, we find that

Now we can build a script to investigate the relative stability of the system using the 
Bode plot. Our goal is to have a phase margin of P M. . = 30°. The associated script 
is shown in Figure 9.62. To make the script interactive, we let the gain K (now set at 
K = 31.5) be adjustable and defined outside the script at the command level. Then 
we set K and run the script to check the phase margin and iterate if necessary. The 
final selected gain is K = 16. Remember that we have utilized a second-order Padé 
approximation of the time delay in our analysis. ■

perform many design iterations quickly and efficiently. First, we investigate the 
steady-state error specification. The steady-state error to a unit step command is
e
K

1 2 . ss = + (9.99)
The effect of the gain K on the steady-state error is clear from Equation (9.99): 
If K = 20, the error is ess =9% of the input magnitude; if K = 10, the error is 
ess = 17% of the input magnitude.

Now we can investigate the overshoot specification in the frequency domain. 
Suppose we require that the percent overshoot is less than 50%. Solving
P O. . 100 exp 50 / 1 2
≈ ≤ − − ζπ ζ
for ζ yields ζ ≥ 0.215. Referring to Equation (9.63), we find that Mpω ≤ 2.45. We 
must keep in mind that Equation (9.63) is for second-order systems only and can 
be used here only as a guideline. We now compute the closed-loop Bode plot and 
check the values of Mpω . Any gain K for which Mpω ≤ 2.45 may be a valid gain for 
our design, but we will have to investigate step responses further to check the actual 
overshoot. The script in Figure 9.63 aids us in this task. We further investigate the 
gains K = 20, 10, and 4.44 (even though Mpω > 2.45 for K = 20).
We can plot the step responses to quantify the percent overshoot as shown in 
Figure 9.64. Additionally, we could have used a Nichols chart to aid the design pro￾cess, as shown in Figure 9.65.

9.12 SUMMARY
The stability of a feedback control system can be determined in the frequency domain 
by utilizing Nyquist’s criterion. Furthermore, Nyquist’s criterion provides us with two 
relative stability measures: (1) gain margin and (2) phase margin. These relative sta￾bility measures can be utilized as indices of the transient performance on the basis of 
correlations established between the frequency domain and the time-domain transient 
response. The magnitude and phase of the closed-loop system can be determined from 
the frequency response of the open-loop transfer function by utilizing constant magni￾tude and phase circles on the polar plot. Alternatively, we can utilize a log-magnitude–
phase diagram with closed-loop magnitude and phase curves superimposed (called 
the Nichols chart) to obtain the closed-loop frequency response. A measure of rela￾tive stability, the maximum magnitude of the closed-loop frequency response, Mpω, is 
available from the Nichols chart. The frequency response, Mpω, can be correlated with 
the damping ratio of the time response and is a useful index of performance. Finally, 
a control system with a pure time delay can be investigated in a manner similar to that 
for systems without time delay. A summary of the Nyquist criterion, the relative stabil￾ity measures, and the Nichols chart is given in Table 9.3 for several transfer functions.
Table 9.3 is very useful and important to the designer and analyst of control sys￾tems. If we have the model of a process G s( ) and a controller G s , c( ) then we can deter￾mine L s G s G s . ( ) = c( ) ( ) With this loop transfer function, we can examine the transfer 
function table in column 1. This table contains fifteen typical transfer functions. For a 
selected transfer function, the table gives the Bode plot, the Nichols chart, and the root 
locus. With this information, the designer can determine or estimate the performance 
of the system and consider the addition or alteration of the controller G s . c( )

In this section, we provide three sets of problems to test your knowledge: True or False, 
Multiple Choice, and Word Match. To obtain direct feedback, check your answers with the 
answer key provided at the conclusion of the end-of-chapter problems. Use the block diagram 
in Figure 9.69 as specified in the various problem statements.
In the following True or False and Multiple Choice problems, circle the correct answers.
1. The gain margin of a system is the increase in the system gain when the 
phase is −180° that will result in a marginally stable system. True or False
2. A conformal mapping is a contour mapping that retains the angles on 
the s-plane on the transformed F s( )-plane. True or False
3. The gain and phase margin are readily evaluated on either a Bode plot 
or a Nyquist plot. True or False
4. A Nichols chart displays curves describing the relationship between the 
open-loop and closed-loop frequency responses. True or False
5. The phase margin of a second-order system (with no zeros) is a function 
of both the damping ratio ζ and the natural frequency, ωn. True or False

P9.8 Electrohydraulic servomechanisms are used in con￾trol systems requiring a rapid response for a large 
mass. An electrohydraulic servomechanism can pro￾vide an output of 100 kW or greater [17]. An illustra￾tion of a servovalve and actuator is shown in Figure 
P9.8(a). The output sensor yields a measurement of ac￾tuator position, which is compared with V . in The error 
is amplified and controls the hydraulic valve position, 
thus controlling the hydraulic fluid flow to the actua￾tor. The block diagram of a closed-loop electrohydrau￾lic servomechanism using pressure feedback to obtain 
damping is shown in Figure P9.8(b) [17, 18]. Typical

eliminate the cable. The key to the cordless elevator 
is the linear motor technology now being applied to 
the development of magnetically levitated rail trans￾portation systems. Under consideration is a linear syn￾chronous motor that propels a passenger car along the 
track like guideway running the length of the elevator 
shaft. The motor works by the interaction of an elec￾tromagnetic field from electric coils on the guideway 
with magnets on the car [28].
If we assume that the motor has negligible fric￾tion, the system may be represented by the model 
shown in Figure AP9.7. Determine K so that the 
phase margin of the system is P M. . = 60°. For the 
gain K selected, determine the system bandwidth. 
Also calculate the maximum value of the output for a 
unit step disturbance for the selected gain.

AP9.11 Patients with a cardiological illness and less than 
normal heart muscle strength can benefit from an as￾sistance device. An electric ventricular assist device 
(EVAD) converts electric power into blood flow by 
moving a pusher plate against a flexible blood sac. The 
pusher plate reciprocates to eject blood in systole and 
to allow the sac to fill in diastole. The EVAD will be 
implanted in tandem or in parallel with the intact nat￾ural heart as shown in Figure AP9.11(a). The EVAD 
is driven by rechargeable batteries, and the elec￾tric power is transmitted inductively across the skin 
through a transmission system. The batteries and the 
transmission system limit the electric energy storage 
and the transmitted peak power. We desire to drive 
the EVAD in a fashion that minimizes its electric 
power consumption [33].
The EVAD has a single input, the applied motor 
voltage, and a single output, the blood flow rate. The 
control system of the EVAD performs two main

plate through its desired stroke, and it varies the 
EVAD blood flow to meet the body’s cardiac output 
demand. The blood flow controller adjusts the blood 
flow rate by varying the EVAD beat rate. A model 
of the feedback control system is shown in Figure 
AP9.11(b). The motor, pump, and blood sac can 
be modeled by a nominal time delay with T = 2 s.

with the controller that continues to stabilize the 
closed-loop system. Plot the phase margin as a function 
of time delay up to the maximum allowed for stability.

system is shown in Figure DP9.3. Select an appropri￾ate gain K that maintains narrow deviation for blood 
pressure while achieving a good dynamic response.
DP9.4 A robot tennis player is shown in Figure DP9.4(a),

determine the phase margin, gain margin, bandwidth, 
percent overshoot, and settling time for each case. 
Obtain the step response for each case, and select the

DP9.5 An electrohydraulic actuator is used to actuate 
large loads for a robot manipulator, as shown in Figure 
DP9.5 [17]. The system is subjected to a step input,

DP9.6 The physical representation of a steel strip-rolling 
mill is a damped-spring system [8]. The output thick￾ness sensor is located a negligible distance from the 
output of the mill, and the objective is to keep the 
thickness as close to a reference value as possible. Any 
change of the input strip thickness is regarded as a dis￾turbance. The system is a nonunity feedback system, as 
shown in Figure DP9.6. Depending on the maintenance 
of the mill, the parameter varies as 50 ≤ <b 400.
Determine the phase margin and gain margin for 
the two extreme values of b when the normal value of 
the gain is K = 100. Recommend a reduced value for 
K so that the phase margin is P M. . ≥ 45° and the gain 
margin is G M. . ≥ 6 dB for the range of b.

PREVIEW
In this chapter, we address the central issue of the design of compensators. Using 
the methods of the previous chapters, we develop several design techniques in the 
frequency domain that enable us to achieve the desired system performance. The 
powerful lead and lag controllers are used in several design examples. Phase-lead 
and phase-lag control design approaches using both root locus plots and Bode 
plots are presented. The proportional-integral (PI) controller is revisited in the 
context of achieving high steady-state tracking accuracies. The chapter concludes 
with a proportional-derivative (PD) controller design with prefiltering for the 
Sequential Design Example: Disk Drive Read System.

methods.

10.1 INTRODUCTION
The performance of a feedback control system is of primary importance. A suitable 
control system is stable and results in an acceptable response to input commands, is 
less sensitive to system parameter changes, results in a minimum steady-state error 
for input commands, and is able to reduce the effect of undesirable disturbances. 
A feedback control system that provides an optimum performance without any 
necessary adjustments is rare. Usually, we find it necessary to compromise among 
the many conflicting and demanding specifications and to adjust the system parameters 
to provide a suitable and acceptable performance when it is not possible to obtain 
all the desired optimum specifications.
It is generally possible to adjust the system parameters in order to provide the 
desired system response. However, we may find that it is not sufficient to adjust a 
single system parameter and obtain the desired performance. Rather, we may be 
required to consider the structure of the system and redesign the system in order 
to obtain a suitable one. That is, sometimes we must examine the scheme or plan 
of the system and obtain a new design or plan that results in a suitable system. Thus, 
the design of a control system is concerned with the arrangement, or the plan, of 
the system structure and the selection of suitable components and parameters. For 
example, if we desire a set of performance measures to be less than some specified 
values, we often encounter a conflicting set of requirements. Hence, if we wish a 
system to have a percent overshoot less P O. .    ≤ 20% and ωn pT = 3.3, we obtain 
a conflicting requirement on the system damping ratio ζ. If we are unable to relax 
these two performance requirements, we must alter the system in some way. The 
alteration or adjustment of a control system in order to provide a suitable perfor￾mance is called compensation; that is, compensation is the adjustment of a system in 
order to make up for deficiencies or inadequacies.
In redesigning a control system to alter the system response, an additional com￾ponent is inserted within the structure of the feedback system. It is this additional 
component or device that equalizes or compensates for the performance deficiency. 
The compensating device is often called a compensator.
A compensator is an additional component that is inserted into a control 
system to compensate for a deficient performance.
The transfer function of a compensator is designated as G s c( ) = E s o i ( ) E s n ( ),
and the compensator can be placed in a suitable location within the structure of 
the system. Several types of compensation are shown in Figure 10.1 for a simple, 
single-loop feedback control system. The compensator placed in the feedforward 
path is called a cascade compensator (Figure 10.1a). Similarly, the other compen￾sation schemes are called feedback, output (or load), and input compensation, as 
shown in Figures 10.1(b), (c), and (d), respectively. The selection of the compensa￾tion scheme depends upon a consideration of the specifications, the power levels at 
various signal nodes in the system, and the networks available for use. Usually, the 
output Y s( ) is a direct output of the process G s( ) and the output compensation of 
Figure 10.1(c) is not physically realizable.

10.2 APPROACHES TO SYSTEM DESIGN
The performance of a control system can be described in terms of the time-domain 
performance measures or the frequency-domain performance measures. The per￾formance of a system can be specified by requiring a certain peak time, Tp, maxi￾mum percent overshoot, P.O., and settling time, Ts, for a step input. Furthermore, it 
is usually necessary to specify the maximum allowable steady-state error for several 
test signal inputs and disturbance inputs. These performance specifications can be 
defined in terms of the desirable location of the poles and zeros of the closed-loop 
system transfer function T s( ). Thus, the location of the s-plane poles and zeros of 
T s( ) can be specified. The locus of the roots of the closed-loop system can be read￾ily obtained for the variation of one system parameter. However, when the locus of 
roots does not result in a suitable root configuration, we must add a compensator 
to alter the locus of the roots as the parameter is varied. Therefore, we can use the 
root locus method and determine a suitable compensator so that the resultant root 
locus yields the desired closed-loop root configuration.
Alternatively, we can describe the performance of a feedback control system 
in terms of frequency performance measures. Then a system can be described in 
terms of the peak of the closed-loop frequency response, Mpω, the resonant fre￾quency, ω ,r the bandwidth, ωB, the gain margin, G.M., and the phase margin, P.M., 
of the system. We can add a suitable compensator, if necessary, in order to satisfy 
the system specifications. The design of the compensator, represented by G s c( ),
is developed in terms of the frequency response as portrayed on the Nyquist plot, 
the Bode plot, or the Nichols chart. Because a cascade transfer function is readily 
accounted for on a Bode plot by adding the frequency response of the network, we 
often prefer to approach the frequency response methods.
Thus, the design of a system is concerned with the alteration of the frequency 
response or the root locus of the system in order to obtain a suitable system 
performance. For frequency response methods, we are concerned with altering 
the system so that the frequency response of the compensated system will sat￾isfy the system specifications. Hence, in the frequency response approach, we use

compensators to alter and reshape the system characteristics represented on the 
Nyquist plot, Bode plot, or Nichols chart.
Alternatively, the design of a control system can be accomplished in the s-plane by 
root locus methods. For the case of the s-plane, the designer wishes to alter and reshape 
the root locus so that the roots of the system lie in the desired locations in the s-plane.
When possible, one way to improve the performance of a control system is to 
alter the process itself. That is, if the system designer is able to specify and alter the 
design of the process represented by the transfer function G s( ), then the perfor￾mance of the system may be improved. For example, to improve the transient be￾havior of a servomechanism position controller, we might choose a better motor for 
the system. In the case of an airplane control system, we might be able to alter the 
aerodynamic design of the airplane and thus improve the flight transient character￾istics. Thus, a control system designer should recognize that an alteration of the pro￾cess may result in an improved system. However, the process is often unalterable or 
has been altered as much as possible and still results in unsatisfactory performance. 
Then the addition of compensators becomes imperative for improving the perfor￾mance of the system.
In the following sections, we will assume that the process has been improved 
as much as possible and that the G s( ) representing the process is unalterable. First, 
we shall consider the addition of a phase-lead compensator and describe the design 
of the network by root locus and frequency response techniques. Then, using both 
the root locus and frequency response techniques, we will describe the design of the 
integration compensators in order to obtain a suitable system performance.
10.3 CASCADE COMPENSATORS
In this section, we consider the design of a cascade compensator, as shown in Figures 
10.1(a) and (b), respectively. The compensator, G s c( ), is cascaded with the process G s( )
to provide a suitable loop transfer function L s( ) = G s c( )G s( )H s( ). The compensa￾tor G s c( ) can be chosen to alter either the shape of the root locus or the frequency 
response. In either case, the compensator may be chosen to have a transfer function

Then the problem reduces to the judicious selection of the poles and zeros of the 
compensator. To illustrate the properties, we consider a first-order compensator. 
The compensation approach developed on the basis of a first-order compensator 
can then be extended to higher-order compensators, for example, by cascading sev￾eral first-order compensators.
A compensator G s c( ) is used with a process G s( ) so that the overall loop gain 
can be set to satisfy the steady-state error requirement, and then G s c( ) is used to 
adjust the system dynamics favorably without affecting the steady-state error.
M10_DORF2374_14_GE_C10.indd 731 15/09/21 8:47 AM732 Chapter 10 The Design of Feedback Control Systems
Consider the first-order compensator with the transfer function
( ) ( ) = +
+
G s K s z
s p c . (10.2)
The design problem then becomes the selection of z, p, and K in order to provide 
a suitable performance. When z p < , the compensator is called a phase-lead 
compensator and has a pole–zero s-plane configuration, as shown in Figure 10.2. If 
the pole was negligible, that is, p z  , and the zero occurred at the origin of the 
s-plane, we would have a differentiator so that
G s( ) ≈ K
p c s. (10.3)
Thus, a compensator of the form of Equation (10.2) is a differentiator-type 
compensator. The differentiator compensator of Equation (10.3) has the frequency 
characteristic

φ ω( ) = − ( ) αωτ ω( ) τ − − tan tan . 1 1 (10.6)
Because the zero occurs first on the frequency axis, we obtain a phase-lead char￾acteristic, as shown in Figure 10.3. The slope of the asymptotic magnitude curve is

frequency ωm, where ωm is the geometric mean of p = 1 τ and z = 1 ; ( ) ατ that is, 
the maximum phase lead occurs halfway between the pole and zero frequencies on

Equation (10.11) is very useful for calculating a necessary α ratio between the 
pole and zero of a compensator in order to provide a required maximum phase 
lead. A plot of φm versus α is shown in Figure 10.4. The phase angle readily 
obtainable from this compensator is not much greater than 70°. Also, there 
are practical limitations on the maximum value of α that we should attempt to

It is often useful to add a cascade compensator that provides a phase-lag 
characteristic. The phase-lag compensator transfer function is

where τ = 1 z and α = > z p 1. The pole lies closest to the origin of the s-plane, as 
shown in Figure 10.5. This type of compensator is often called an integrating com￾pensator because it has a frequency response like an integrator over a finite range 
of frequencies. The Bode plot of the phase-lag compensator is obtained from the 
transfer function

and is shown in Figure 10.6. The form of the Bode plot of the lag compensator is 
similar to that of the phase-lead compensator; the difference is the resulting attenu￾ation and phase-lag angle instead of amplification and phase-lead angle. However, 
note that the shapes of the diagrams of Figures 10.3 and 10.6 are similar. Therefore, 
we can show that the maximum phase lag occurs at ωm = zp.
In the succeeding sections, we wish to utilize these compensation networks to 
obtain a desired system frequency response or s-plane root location. The lead com￾pensator can provide a phase-lead angle and thus a satisfactory phase margin for 
a system. Alternatively, the phase-lead compensator can enable us to reshape the 
root locus and thus provide the desired root locations. The phase-lag compensator

is used, not to provide a phase-lag angle, which is normally a destabilizing influ￾ence, but rather to provide an attenuation and to increase the steady-state error 
constant [3].
10.4 PHASE-LEAD DESIGN USING THE BODE PLOT
The Bode plot is used to design a suitable phase-lead compensator in preference to 
other frequency response plots. The frequency response of the cascade compensator 
is added to the frequency response of the uncompensated system. That is, because 
the total loop transfer function of Figure 10.1(a) is L j ( ) ω ω = G j c( )G j ( ) ω ω H j ( ),
we will first plot the Bode plot for G j ( ) ω ω H j ( ). Then we can examine the plot 
for G j ( ) ω ω H j ( ) and determine a suitable location for p and z of G j c( ) ω in order 
to satisfactorily reshape the frequency response. The uncompensated G j ( ) ω ω H j ( )
is plotted with the desired gain to allow an acceptable steady-state error. Then the 
phase margin and the expected Mpω are examined to find whether they satisfy the 
specifications. If the phase margin is not sufficient, phase lead can be added to 
the phase-angle curve of the system by placing the G j c( ) ω in a suitable location. To 
obtain maximum additional phase lead, we adjust the network so that the frequency 
ωm is located at the frequency where the magnitude of the compensated magnitude 
curve crosses the 0-dB axis. The value of the added phase lead required allows us

to determine the necessary value for α from Equation (10.11) or Figure 10.4. The 
zero z = 1 ( ) ατ is located by noting that the maximum phase lead should occur at 
ωm = zp, halfway between the pole and the zero. Because the total magnitude 
gain for the compensator is 20 log  , α we expect a gain of 10 log α at ωm. Thus, we 
determine the compensator by completing the following steps:
1. Evaluate the uncompensated system phase margin when the error constants are satisfied.
2. Allowing for a small amount of safety, determine the necessary additional phase lead φm.
3. Evaluate α from Equation (10.11).
4. Assume K G α = ( )s 1 in s in Equation (10.7). This gain will be adjusted in step 8.
5. Evaluate 10 log α and determine the frequency where the uncompensated magnitude 
curve is equal to −10 log    α dB. Because the compensator provides a gain of 10 log α
at ωm, this frequency is the new 0-dB crossover frequency and ωm simultaneously.
6. Calculate the pole p a = ωm and z p = α.
7. Draw the compensated frequency response, check the resulting phase margin, and re￾peat the steps if necessary.
8. Finally, for an acceptable design, raise the gain, K, compensator in order to account for 
the attenuation ( ) 1 . α
EXAMPLE 10.1 A lead compensator for a type-two system
Let us consider a single-loop feedback control system as shown in Figure 10.1(a), 
where
10
2 G s( ) = s
(10.14)
and H s( ) = 1. The uncompensated system is a type-two system and at first appears 
to possess a satisfactory steady-state error for both step and ramp input signals. 
However, the response of the uncompensated system is an undamped oscillation 
because

Perhaps the easiest way to check the value of ωn for the frequency response is to 
relate ωn to the bandwidth ωB, and evaluate the −3 -dB bandwidth of the closed￾loop system. For a closed-loop system with ζ = 0.45, we estimate the closed-loop 
bandwidth ω ζ B n = −( ) 1.19 + = 1.85 ω 3.00. The bandwidth can be checked follow￾ing compensation by utilizing the Nichols chart. The Bode plot of

is shown as solid lines in Figure 10.7. The phase margin of the system is required to 
be approximately
0.01

0.01 φpm 45°. ζ = = = (10.17)
The phase margin of the uncompensated system is 0° because the double integration 
results in a constant 180° phase lag. Therefore, we must add a 45° phase-lead angle 
at the crossover (0-dB) frequency of the compensated magnitude curve. Evaluating 
the value of α, we have

and thus α = 5.8. To provide a margin of safety, we will use α = 6. The value of 
10 log α is then equal to 7.78 dB. Then the lead compensator will add an addi￾tional gain of 7.78 dB at the frequency ωm, and we want to have ωm equal to the 
compensated slope near the 0-dB axis (the dashed line) so that the new crossover 
is ωm and the dashed magnitude curve is 7.78 dB above the uncompensated curve 
at the crossover frequency. Thus, the compensated crossover frequency is located 
by evaluating the frequency where the uncompensated magnitude curve is equal to 
−7.78 dB, which in this case is ω = 4.95. Then the maximum phase-lead angle is Magnitude (dB)

M10_DORF2374_14_GE_C10.indd 739 15/09/21 8:47 AM740 Chapter 10 The Design of Feedback Control Systems
At the crossover frequency ω ω = =c 6.2  rad s, we have
φ ω( ) = −162°, (10.25)
and therefore the phase margin is P M. . = 18°. We need to add a phase-lead com￾pensator so that the phase margin is raised to P M. . = 40° at the new crossover 
(0-dB) frequency. Because the compensation crossover frequency is greater than 
the uncompensated crossover frequency, the phase lag of the uncompensated sys￾tem is also greater. We shall account for this additional phase lag by attempting to 
obtain a maximum phase lead of 40° − = 18° 22°, plus a small increment of phase 
lead to account for the added lag. Thus, we will design a compensator with a maxi￾mum phase lead equal to 22° + = 8° 30°. Then, calculating α, we obtain
1

sin 30° 0.5, α

+ = = (10.26)
and therefore α = 3.
The maximum phase lead occurs at ωm, and this frequency will be selected 
so that the new crossover frequency and ωm coincide. The lead compensator will 
add an additional 10 log  1 α = = 0 log 3 4.8 dB at ωm. The compensated crossover 
frequency is then evaluated where the magnitude of G j ( ) ω is −4.8 dB, and thus 
ω ω m c = = 8.4. Drawing the compensated magnitude line so that it intersects the 
0-dB axis at ω ω = = 8.4, c we find that z = = ω α m / 4.8 and p z = = α 14.4.
Therefore, the compensator is

To verify the final phase margin, we can evaluate the phase of G j c( ) ω ω G j ( ) at 
ω ω = =c 8.4 and thus obtain the phase margin. The phase angle is then

= −136.3°. (10.29)
Therefore, the phase margin for the compensated system is P M. . = 43.7°. The step 
response of this system yields P O. . = 28% with a settling time of Ts = 0.9 s. The 
compensated system has a steady-state error of 5% to a ramp, as desired.
The Nichols chart for the compensated and uncompensated system is shown in 
Figure 10.8(b). The reshaping of the frequency response locus is clear on this chart. 
Note the increased phase margin for the compensated system as well as the reduced

magnitude of Mpω, the maximum magnitude of the closed-loop frequency response. 
In this case, Mpω has been reduced from an uncompensated value of  + 12 dB to a 
compensated value of approximately  + 3.2 dB. Also, we note that the closed-loop 
3-dB bandwidth of the compensated system is equal to 12 rad/s compared with 9.5 
rad/s for the uncompensated system. ■
10.5 PHASE-LEAD DESIGN USING THE ROOT LOCUS
The design of the phase-lead compensator can also be readily accomplished using 
the root locus. The locations of the compensator zero and pole are selected so as 
to result in a satisfactory root locus for the compensated system. The specifications 
of the system are used to specify the desired location of the dominant roots of the 
system. The s-plane root locus method is as follows:
1. List the system specifications and translate them into a desired root location for the 
dominant roots.
2. Sketch the root locus with a constant gain controller, G s c( ) = K, and determine whether 
the desired root locations can be realized.
3. If a compensator is necessary, place the zero of the phase-lead compensator directly 
below the desired root location (or to the left of the first two real poles).
4. Determine the pole location so that the total angle at the desired root location is 180° 
and therefore is on the compensated root locus.
5. Evaluate the total system gain at the desired root location and then calculate the error 
constant.
6. Repeat the steps if the error constant is not satisfactory.
Therefore, we first locate our desired dominant root locations so that the 
dominant roots satisfy the specifications in terms of ζ and ωn, as shown in 
Figure  10.9(a). The root locus of the system with G s c( ) = K is sketched as illus￾trated in Figure 10.9(b). Then the zero is added to provide a phase lead by placing 
it to the left of the first two real poles. Some caution is necessary because the zero 
must not alter the dominance of the desired roots; that is, the zero should not be 
placed closer to the origin than the second pole on the real axis, or a real root near 
the origin will result and will dominate the system response. Thus, in Figure 10.9(c), 
we note that the desired root is directly above the second pole, and we place the 
zero z somewhat to the left of the second real pole.
Consequently, the real root may be near the real zero, and the coefficient of this 
term of the partial fraction expansion may be relatively small. Hence, the response due 
to this real root may have very little effect on the overall system response. Nevertheless, 
the designer must be continually aware that the compensated system response will be 
influenced by the roots and zeros of the system and that the dominant roots will not by 
themselves dictate the response. It is usually wise to allow for some margin of error in 
the design and to test the compensated system using a computer simulation.
Because the desired root is a point on the root locus when the final compensa￾tion is accomplished, we expect the algebraic sum of the vector angles to be 180° 
at that point. Thus, we calculate the angle θp from the pole of the compensator in 
M10_DORF2374_14_GE_C10.indd 741 15/09/21 8:47 AM742 Chapter 10 The Design of Feedback Control Systems
order to result in a total angle of 180°. Then, locating a line at an angle θp intersect￾ing the desired root, we are able to evaluate the compensator pole p, as shown in 
Figure 10.9(d).
The advantage of the root locus method is the ability of the designer to specify 
the location of the dominant roots and therefore the dominant transient response. 
The disadvantage of the method is that we cannot directly specify an error constant 
(for example, Kυ) as in the Bode plot approach. After the design is complete, we 
evaluate the gain of the system at the root location, which depends on p and z, and 
then calculate the error constant for the compensated system. If the error constant 
is not satisfactory, we must repeat the design steps and alter the location of the de￾sired root as well as the location of the compensator pole and zero.

Now we place the zero of the compensator directly below the desired location

Therefore, to have a total of 180° at the desired root, we evaluate the angle from the 
undetermined pole, θp, as
− = 180° − − 142° θp, (10.35)
or θp = 38°. Then a line is drawn at an angle θp = 38° intersecting the desired root 
location and the real axis, as shown in Figure 10.10. The point of intersection with 
the real axis is then s p = − = −3.6. Therefore, the compensator is

Finally, the error constants of this system are evaluated. We find that this system 
with two open-loop integrations will result in a zero steady-state error for a step and 
ramp input signal. The acceleration constant is

3.6
2.25. ( ) Ka = = (10.39)
The steady-state performance of this system is quite satisfactory, and there￾fore the compensation is complete. When we compare the compensator evaluated 
by the s-plane method with the compensator obtained by using the Bode plot ap￾proach, we find that the magnitudes of the poles and zeros are different. However, 
the resulting system will have the same performance, and we need not be concerned 
with the difference. In fact, the difference arises from the design step (number 3), 
which places the zero directly below the desired root location. If we placed the zero 
at s = −2.0, we would find that the pole evaluated by the s-plane method is approx￾imately equal to the pole evaluated by the Bode plot approach.
The specifications for the transient response of this system were originally ex￾pressed in terms of the percent overshoot and the settling time. These specifications 
were translated, on the basis of an approximation of the system by a second-order 
system, to an equivalent ζ and ωn and therefore a desired root location. However, 
the original specifications will be satisfied only if the selected roots are dominant. 
The zero of the compensator and the root resulting from the addition of the com￾pensator pole result in a third-order system with a zero. The validity of approximat￾ing this system with a second-order system without a zero is dependent upon the 
validity of the dominance assumption. Often, the designer will simulate the final 
design and obtain the actual transient response of the system. The actual percent 
M10_DORF2374_14_GE_C10.indd 744 15/09/21 8:48 AMSection 10.5 Phase-Lead Design Using the Root Locus 745
overshoot is P O. . = 46% and a settling time (to within 2% of the final value) is 
Ts = 3.8 s for a step input. These values compare moderately well with the specified 
values of P O. . = 35% and Ts = 4 s, and they justify the use of the dominant root 
specifications. The difference in the percent overshoot from the specified value is 
due to the zero, which is not negligible. Thus, again we find that the specification of 
dominant roots is a useful approach but must be utilized with caution and under￾standing. A second attempt to obtain a compensated system with a percent over￾shoot of P O. . = 30% would use a prefilter to eliminate the effect of the zero in the 
closed-loop transfer function. ■
EXAMPLE 10.4 Lead compensator for a type-one system
Consider the system of Example 10.2 and design a compensator based on the root 
locus approach. The system loop transfer function is
( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) = = +
L s G s G s K
s s c
40
2 , (10.40)
when G s c( ) = K. We want the damping ratio of the dominant roots of the system to 
be ζ = 0.4 and the velocity error constant to be Kυ ≥ 20.
To achieve a rapid settling time, we will select the real part of the desired roots 
as ζωn = 4, and therefore T = 1 s. s This implies the natural frequency of these roots 
is fairly large, ωn = 10; hence, the velocity constant should be reasonably large. The 
location of the desired roots is shown in Figure 10.11(a) for ζωn = = 4, ζ 0.4, and 
ωn = 10.
The zero of the compensator is placed at s z = − = −4, directly below the de￾sired root location. Then the angle at the desired root location is
φ = −114° − + 102° 90° = −126°. (10.41)
Therefore, the angle from the undetermined pole is determined from
− = 180° − − 126° θp,
and thus θp = 54°. This angle is drawn to intersect the desired root location, and p
is evaluated as s p = − = −10.6, as shown in Figure 10.11(a). The gain of the com￾pensated system is then

The step response of the compensated system yields a percent overshoot of

system. The phase-lead compensator adds a phase-lead angle to provide an adequate 
phase margin. Using an s-plane design approach, we can choose the phase-lead com￾pensator in order to alter the system root locus and place the roots of the system in a

desired position in the s-plane. When the design specifications include an error con￾stant requirement, the Bode plot method is more suitable, because the error constant 
of a system designed on the s-plane must be ascertained following the choice of a 
compensator pole and zero. Therefore, the root locus method often results in an it￾erative design procedure when the error constant is specified. On the other hand, the 
root locus is a very satisfactory approach when the specifications are given in terms 
of percent overshoot and settling time, thus specifying the ζ and ωn of the desired 
dominant roots in the s-plane. The use of a lead compensator extends the band￾width of a feedback system, which may be objectionable for systems subjected to 
large amounts of noise. Also, lead compensators are not suitable for providing high 
steady-state accuracy in systems requiring very high error constants. To provide large 
error constants, typically Kp and Kυ, we must consider the use of integration-type 
compensators.
10.6 SYSTEM DESIGN USING INTEGRATION COMPENSATORS
For many control systems, the primary objective is obtaining a high steady-state 
accuracy. Another goal is maintaining the transient performance of these systems 
within reasonable limits. The steady-state accuracy of many feedback systems can 
be improved by increasing the gain in the forward channel. However, the resulting 
transient response may be unacceptable—even unstable. Therefore, it is often nec￾essary to introduce a compensator in the forward path of a feedback control system 
in order to provide a sufficient steady-state accuracy.
Consider the single-loop control system shown in Figure 10.12. The compen￾sator is chosen to provide a large error constant. With G s p( ) = 1, the steady-state 
error of this system is

The steady-state error of a system depends on the number of poles at the origin for 
L s G s G s H s . ( ) = c( ) ( ) ( ) A pole at the origin can be considered an integration, and 
therefore the steady-state accuracy of a system ultimately depends on the number of 
integrations in the loop transfer function. If the steady-state accuracy is not sufficient, 
we will introduce an integration-type compensator G s c( ) in order to compensate for 
the lack of integration in the uncompensated loop transfer function G s c c ( ) H s( )..

The transient performance can be adjusted to satisfy the system specifications by 
adjusting the constants K K,   P, and KI. The adjustment of the transient response is 
perhaps best accomplished by using root locus methods and drawing a root locus for 
the gain K KP after locating the zero s K = − I P K on the s-plane.
The addition of an integration as G s c P ( ) = + K KI s can also be used to re￾duce the steady-state error for a ramp input r t( ) = ≥ t t ,   0. For example, if the un￾compensated system G s( ) possessed one integration, the additional integration due 
to G s c( ) would result in a zero steady-state error for a ramp input.

The transient response of the system is required to have a percent overshoot less than 
or equal to P O. . ≤ 20%. Since the PI compensator introduces a zero that will interact 
with the dominant poles, we will target a slightly higher damping ratio of the dominant 
poles to increase the likelihood of achieving the desired percent overshoot. Therefore, 
the dominant complex roots will be placed on the ζ = 0.6 line, as shown in Figure 10.13. 
We will adjust the compensator zero so that the negative real part of the complex roots 
is ζωn = 0.75, and thus the settling time (with a 2% criterion) is Ts n 4 16

desired root is −180°. Therefore, the sum of the angles at the desired root is
− = 180° − − 127° 104° − + 38° θz,
where θz is the angle from the undetermined zero. Consequently, we find that 
θz = +89°, and the location of the zero is z = −0.75. Finally, to determine the gain at 
the desired root, we evaluate the vector lengths from the poles and zeros and obtain

The compensated root locus and the location of the zero are shown in Figure 10.13. 
Note that the zero z K = − I P K should be placed to the left of the pole at s = −0.5
to ensure that the complex roots dominate the transient response. In fact, the third 
root of the compensated system of Figure 10.13 can be determined as s = −1.0, and 
therefore this real root is only 4
3 times the real part of the complex roots. Although 
complex roots dominate the response of the system, the equivalent damping of the 
system is somewhat less than ζ = 0.60 due to the real root and zero.

The effect of the zero is to increase the overshoot to a step input. The percent over￾shoot is P O. . = 16%, the setting time is Ts = 4.9 s, and the steady-state error to a 
unit step is zero, as desired. ■
10.7 PHASE-LAG DESIGN USING THE ROOT LOCUS
The phase-lag compensator is an integration-type compensator and can be used to 
increase the error constant of a feedback control system. The transfer function of 
the phase-lag compensator is of the form

where

and .
τ = = α
Begin by supposing that the controller is a constant gain controller, G s c( ) = K. We 
refer to the system with loop transfer function L s( ) = KG( )s as the uncompensated 
system. Then, for example, the velocity error constant of a type-one uncompen￾sated system is
υ = ( ) →
lim . ,unc 0
K K sG s s
(10.56)
If we add the phase-lag compensator in Equation (10.55), we have

z
p
K (10.57)
or
. ,comp
,unc
= α υ
υ
K
K (10.58)
Now, if the pole and zero of the compensator are chosen so that z p = < α 1,
the resultant Kυ,comp will be increased at the desired root location by α. Then, for 
example, if z = 0.1 and p = 0.01, the velocity constant of the desired root location 
will be increased by a factor of 10. If the compensator pole and zero appear rela￾tively close together on the s-plane, their effect on the location of the desired root 
will be negligible. Therefore, the compensator pole–zero combination near the ori￾gin of the s-plane can be used to increase the error constant of a feedback system by 
the factor α while altering the root location very slightly.
The steps necessary for the design of a phase-lag compensator on the s-plane 
are as follows:
1. Obtain the root locus of the uncompensated system with a constant gain controller, 
G s c( ) = K.
2. Determine the transient performance specifications for the system and locate suit￾able dominant root locations on the uncompensated root locus that will satisfy the 
specifications.
M10_DORF2374_14_GE_C10.indd 750 15/09/21 8:48 AMSection 10.7 Phase-Lag Design Using the Root Locus 751
3. Calculate the loop gain at the desired root location and thus the uncompensated system 
error constant.
4. Compare the uncompensated error constant with the desired error constant, and 
calculate the necessary increase that must result from the pole–zero ratio α of the 
compensator.
5. With the known ratio of the pole–zero combination of the compensator, determine a 
suitable location of the pole and zero of the compensator so that the compensated root 
locus will still pass through the desired root location. Locate the pole and zero near the 
origin of the s-plane.
The fifth requirement can be satisfied if the magnitudes of the pole and zero 
are significantly less than ωn of the dominant roots and they appear to merge as 
measured from the desired root location. The pole and zero will appear to merge at 
the root location if the angles from the compensator pole and zero are essentially 
equal as measured to the root location. One method of locating the zero and pole of 
the compensator is based on the requirement that the difference between the angle 
of the pole and the angle of the zero as measured at the desired root is less than 2°.

We require the damping ratio of the dominant complex roots to be ζ ≥ 0.45, with a

at s = −1 and results in a root on the ζ = 0.45 line at s j = −1 2 ± , as shown in 
Figure 10.14. Measuring the gain at this root, we have 2.24 5. 2 K = = ( ) Therefore,

to the ζ = 0.707 line by using a phase-lead compensator. Therefore, we will attempt 
to satisfy the Kυ and ζ requirements by using a phase-lag compensator. The uncom￾pensated root locus of this system is shown in Figure 10.16, and the roots are shown 
when ζ = 0.707 and s j = −2.9 ± 2.9. Measuring the gain at these roots, we find that

The Bode plot of the phase-lag compensator is shown in Figure 10.6. On the Bode 
plot, the pole and the zero of the compensator have a magnitude much smaller than 
the smallest pole of the uncompensated system. Thus, the phase lag is not the useful 
effect of the compensator; it is the attenuation −20 log α that is the useful effect 
for compensation. The phase-lag compensator is used to provide an attenuation 
and therefore to lower the 0-dB (crossover) frequency of the system. However, at 
lower crossover frequencies, we usually find that the phase margin of the system is 
increased, and our specifications can be satisfied. The design procedure for a phase￾lag compensator on the Bode plot is as follows:
1. Obtain the Bode plot of the uncompensated system with the constant gain controller, 
G s K, c( ) = and with the gain adjusted for the desired error constant.
2. Determine the phase margin of the uncompensated system and, if it is insufficient, pro￾ceed with the following steps.
3. Determine the frequency where the phase margin requirement would be satisfied if the 
magnitude curve crossed the 0-dB line at this frequency, ω c
′ . (Allow for 5° phase lag 
from the phase-lag compensator when determining the new crossover frequency.)
4. Place the zero of the compensator one decade below the new crossover frequency ω c
′ ,
and thus ensure only 5° of additional phase lag at ω c
′ (see Figure 10.8) due to the lag 
network.
5. Measure the necessary attenuation at ω c
′ to ensure that the magnitude curve crosses at 
this frequency.
6. Calculate α by noting that the attenuation introduced by the phase-lag compensator is 
−20 log α at ω c
′ .
7. Calculate the pole as ω α p z = = 1 , ( ) τ ω α and the design is completed.
An example of this design procedure will illustrate that the method is simple to 
carry out in practice.
EXAMPLE 10.8 Design of a phase-lag compensator

where K K υ = 2. We want Kυ ≥ 20 with a phase margin of P M. . = 45°. The un￾compensated Bode plot is shown as a solid line in Figure 10.17. The uncompensated 
system has a phase margin of P M. . = 18°, and the phase margin must be increased. 
Allowing 5° for the phase-lag compensator, we locate the frequency ω where 
φ ω( ) = −130°, which is to be our new crossover frequency ω c
′ . In this case, we find 
that ω′
c = 1.66. We select ω′
c = 1.5 to allow for a small margin of safety. The atten￾uation necessary to cause ω c
′ to be the new crossover frequency is equal to 20 dB. 
Both the compensated and uncompensated magnitude curves are an asymptotic ap￾proximation. Thus, ω′
c = 1.5, and the required attenuation is 20 dB.

Then we find that 20 dB 2 = 0 log α, or α = 10. Therefore, the zero is one decade 
below the crossover, or ω ω z c = = ′ 10 0.15, and the pole is at ω ω p z = = 10 0.015.

The frequency response of the compensated system is shown in Figure 10.17(a) with 
dashed lines. It is evident that the phase lag introduces an attenuation that lowers the 
crossover frequency and therefore increases the phase margin. Note that the phase 
angle of the lag compensator has almost totally disappeared at the crossover fre￾quency ω c
′ . As a final check, we numerically evaluate the phase margin and find that 
P M. . = 46.9° at ω′
c = 1.58 which is the desired result. Using the Nichols chart, we find 
that the closed-loop bandwidth of the system has been reduced from ω = 10  rad s for 
the uncompensated system to ω = 2.5  rad s for the compensated system. Due to the 
reduced bandwidth, we expect a slower time response to a step command.
The time response of the system is shown in Figure 10.17(b). Note that the per￾cent overshoot is P O. . = 25% and the peak time is Tp = 1.84 s. Thus, the response 
is within the specifications. ■

Allowing 5° for the phase-lag compensator, we locate the frequency where the phase 
is φ ω( ) = −105°. This frequency is equal to ω = 1.3, and therefore we will attempt to 
locate the new crossover frequency at ω′

We have seen that a phase-lag compensator can be used to alter the fre￾quency response of a feedback control system in order to attain satisfactory sys￾tem performance. The system design is satisfactory when the asymptotic curve for 
the magnitude of the compensated system crosses the 0-dB line with a slope of 
−20  dB decade. The attenuation of the phase-lag compensator reduces the mag￾nitude of the crossover (0-dB) frequency to a point where the phase margin of the 
system is satisfactory. Thus, in contrast to the phase-lead compensator, the phase￾lag compensator reduces the closed-loop bandwidth of the system as it maintains a 
suitable error constant.
The phase-lead compensator alters the frequency response of a system by add￾ing a positive (leading) phase angle and therefore increases the phase margin at the 
crossover (0-dB) frequency. It becomes evident that a designer might wish to con￾sider using a compensator that provides the attenuation of a phase-lag compensator 
and the lead-phase angle of a phase-lead compensator. Such a network does exist. It 
is called a lead-lag network. The transfer function of this compensator is

The first factors in the numerator and denominator, which are functions of τ1,
provide the phase-lead portion of the compensator. The second factors, which are 
functions of τ2, provide the phase-lag portion of the compensator. The parameter 
β is adjusted to provide suitable attenuation of the low-frequency portion of the 
frequency response, and the parameter α is adjusted to provide an additional phase 
lead at the new crossover (0-dB) frequency. Alternatively, the compensation can be 
designed on the s-plane by placing the lead pole and zero compensation in order to 
locate the dominant roots in a desired location. Then the phase-lag compensator is 
used to raise the error constant at the dominant root location. The design of a phase 
lead-lag compensator follows the procedures already discussed. Other literature 
will further illustrate the utility of lead-lag compensation [2, 3, 25].
10.9 DESIGN ON THE BODE PLOT USING ANALYTICAL METHODS

The design steps for adding phase lead are:

2. Determine the phase margin desired and therefore the required phase φ for Equation 
(10.71).
3. Verify that the phase lead is applicable: φ > 0 and M > 0.
4. Determine whether a single stage will be sufficient by testing c p > + 1. 2

5. Determine α from Equation (10.73).
6. Determine τ from Equation (10.74).
If we need to design a single-stage, phase-lag compensator, then φ < 0 and M < 0
(step 3). Step 4 will require 1 1 . 2 c p < + ( ) Otherwise the method is similar.
EXAMPLE 10.10 Design using an analytical technique
Consider the system of Example 10.1 using the analytical technique. Examine the 
uncompensated curves in Figure 10.7. We select ω = 5. c Then, as before, we desire 
a phase margin of P M. . = 45°. The compensator must yield this phase, so
p = = tan 45° 1. (10.75)
The required magnitude contribution is 8 dB, or M = 8, so that

In the earlier sections of this chapter, we utilized compensators of the form
G s K s z
s p c( ) = +
+
that alter the roots of the characteristic equation of the closed-loop system. 
However, the closed-loop transfer function T s( ) will contain the zero of G s c( ) as 
a zero of T s( ). This zero will significantly affect the response of the system T s( ).
Let us consider the system shown in Figure 10.19, where
1 G s( ) = .

For illustrative purposes, the specifications require a settling time (with a 2% cri￾terion) of Ts = 0.5 s and a percent overshoot of approximately P O. . = 4%. We 
use ζ = 1 2 and note that
4 . ζω

Thus, we require that ζωn = 8 or ωn = 8 2. We now obtain

The effect of the zero on the step response is significant. The percent overshoot to 
a step is P O. . = 21%.
We use a prefilter G s p( ) to eliminate the zero from T s( ) while maintaining the 
DC gain of 1, thus requiring that

Then we have

and the percent overshoot of this system is P O. . = 4.5%, as expected.
Let us now consider again Example 10.3, which includes the design of a lead 
compensator. The resulting closed-loop transfer function can be determined to be

If G s p( ) = 1 (no prefilter), then we obtain a response with a percent overshoot of

G s , s p( ) = +
we obtain a percent overshoot of P O. . = 6.7% and a settling time of Ts =
3.8 s. The real root at s = −1.66 helps to damp the step response. The prefilter is 
very useful in permitting the designer to introduce a compensator with a zero to ad￾just the root locations (poles) of the closed-loop transfer function while eliminating 
the effect of the zero incorporated in T s( ).
In general, we will add a prefilter for systems with lead compensators or PI com￾pensators. Typically, we will not use a prefilter for a system with a lag compensator, 
since we expect the effect of the zero to be insignificant. To check this assertion, let 
us consider again the design obtained in Example 10.6. The system with a phase-lag 
compensator is

since the zero at s = −0.1 and the pole at s = −0.104 approximately cancel. We 
expect a percent overshoot of P O. . = 20% and a settling time (with a 2% criterion) 
of Ts = 4.0 s for the design parameters ζ = 0.45 and ζωn = 1. The actual response 
has a percent overshoot of P O. . = 26% and a settling time of Ts = 5.8 s. Thus, we 
usually do not use a prefilter with systems that utilize lag compensators.

If p = 1.2, we cancel the effect of the zero. The response of the system with a pre￾filter is summarized in Table 10.1. We choose the appropriate value for p to achieve 
the response desired. Note that p = 2.40 will provide a response that may be de￾sirable, since it effects a faster rise time than p = 1.20. The prefilter provides an 
additional parameter to select for design purposes. ■
10.11 DESIGN FOR DEADBEAT RESPONSE
Often, the goal for a control system is to achieve a fast response to a step command 
with minimal overshoot. We define a deadbeat response as a response that proceeds 
rapidly to the desired level and holds at that level with minimal overshoot. We use 
the ±2% band at the desired level as the acceptable range of variation from the de￾sired response. Then, if the response enters the band at time T ,s it has satisfied the 
settling time Ts upon entry to the band, as illustrated in Figure 10.20. A deadbeat 
response has the following characteristics:
1. Steady-state error 0 =
2. Fast response m → inimum Tr and Ts
3. 0.1% ≤ < P O. . 2%
4. Percent undershoot P.O. < 2%.
Characteristics (3) and (4) require that the response remain within the ±2% band 
so that the entry to the band occurs at the settling time.
Consider the transfer function T s( ) of a closed-loop system. To determine the 
coefficients that yield the optimal deadbeat response, the standard transfer function 
is first normalized. An example of this for a third-order system is

Equation (10.83) is the normalized, third-order, closed-loop transfer function. For 
a higher order system, the same method is used to derive the normalized equation. 
The coefficients of the equation—α β,   ,  γ, and so on—are then assigned the values 
necessary to meet the requirement of deadbeat response. The coefficients recorded 
in Table 10.2 were selected to achieve deadbeat response and minimize settling 
time and rise time Tr. The form of Equation (10.83) is normalized since s s = ωn.
Thus, we choose ωn based on the desired settling time or rise time. Therefore, if we 
have a third-order system with a required settling time of Ts = 1.2 s, we note from 
Table 10.2 that the normalized settling time is
ωn s T = 4.04.

Once ωn is chosen, the complete closed-loop transfer function is known, having 
the form of Equation (10.81). When designing a system to obtain a deadbeat re￾sponse, the compensator is chosen, and the closed-loop transfer function is found. 
This compensated transfer function is then set equal to Equation (10.81), and the 
required compensator can be determined.

We use Table 10.2 to determine the required coefficients, α = 1.90 and β = 2.20.
If we select a settling time (with a 2% criterion) of Ts = 2 s, then ωn s T = 4.04, and 
thus ωn = 2.02. The required closed-loop system has the characteristic equation
q s s sn ns s n 3.84s s 8.98 8.24. 3 2 2 3 3 2 ( ) = + αω + + βω ω = + + +
Then, we determine that p z = = 2.84,   1.34, and K = 6.14. The response of this 
system will have T = 2 s, s and T = 1.72 s. r ■
10.12 DESIGN EXAMPLES
In this section we present two illustrative examples. The first example is a rotor 
winder control system where both a lead and lag compensator are designed using 
root locus methods. In the second example, precise control of a milling machine 
used in manufacturing is employed to illustrate the design process. A lag compen￾sator is designed using root locus methods to meet steady-state tracking error and 
percent overshoot specifications.

EXAMPLE 10.13 Rotor winder control system
Our goal is to replace a manual operation using a machine to wind copper wire 
onto the rotors of small motors. Each motor has three separate windings of sev￾eral hundred turns of wire. It is important that the windings be consistent and that 
the throughput of the process be high. The operator simply inserts an unwound 
rotor, pushes a start button, and then removes the completely wound rotor. The DC 
motor is used to achieve accurate rapid windings. Thus, the goal is to achieve high 
steady-state accuracy for both position and velocity. The control system is shown 
in Figure 10.21(a) and the block diagram in Figure 10.21(b). This system has zero 
steady-state error for a step input, and the steady-state error for a ramp input is

Selecting z2 = 0.1 to avoid affecting the uncompensated root locus, we have 
p2 = 0.0055. We then obtain a step response with a P O. . = 12% and a settling time 
of Ts = 2.5 s. The results for the simple gain, the lead network, and the lag network 
are summarized in Table 10.3.

lead compensator resulted in Kυ = 2.1 (see Table 10.3). To obtain Kυ = 21, we 
use α = 10 and select z2 = 0.1 and p2 = 0.01. Then the compensated loop transfer

EXAMPLE 10.14 Milling machine control system
Smaller, lighter, less costly sensors are being developed by engineers for machin￾ing and other manufacturing processes. A milling machine table is depicted in 
Figure 10.24. This particular machine table has a new sensor that obtains informa￾tion about the cutting process (that is, the depth-of-cut) from the acoustic emission 
(AE) signals. Acoustic emissions are low-amplitude, high-frequency stress waves 
that originate from the rapid release of strain energy in a continuous medium. 
The AE sensors are commonly piezoelectric amplitude sensitive in the 100 kHz to 
1 MHz range; they are cost effective and can be mounted on most machine tools.
There is a relationship between the sensitivity of the AE power signal and small 
depth-of-cut changes [15, 18, 19]. This relationship can be exploited to obtain a 
feedback signal or measurement of the depth-of-cut. A simplified block diagram of 
the feedback system is shown in Figure 10.25. The elements of the design process 
emphasized in this example are highlighted in Figure 10.26.
Since the acoustic emissions are sensitive to material, tool geometry, tool 
wear, and cutting parameters such as cutter rotational speed, the measurement 
of the depth-of-cut is modeled as being corrupted by noise, denoted by N s( ) in 
Figure  10.25. Also disturbances to the process, denoted by T s d ( ), are modeled. 
These could represent external disturbances resulting in unwanted motion of the 
cutter, fluctuations in the cutter rotation speed, and so forth.

and represents the model of the cutter apparatus and the AE sensor dynamics. The 
input to G s( ) is a control signal to actuate an electromechanical device, which then 
applies downward pressure on the cutter.
There are a variety of methods available to obtain the model represented by 
Equation (10.88). One approach would be to use basic principles to obtain a math￾ematical model in the form of a nonlinear differential equation, which can then be 
linearized about an operating point leading to a linear model (or equivalently, a 
transfer function). The basic principles include Newton’s laws, the various conser￾vation laws, and Kirchhoff’s laws. Another approach would be to assume a form of 
the model (such as a second-order system) with unknown parameters (such as ωn
and ζ ), and then experimentally obtain good values of the unknown parameters.

A third approach is to conduct a laboratory experiment to obtain the step or 
impulse response of the system. In other words we can apply an input (in this case, 
a voltage) to the system and measure the output—the depth-of-cut into the desired 
workpiece. Suppose, for example, we have the impulse response data shown in 
Figure 10.27 (the small circles on the graph represent the data). If we had access to 
the function C t imp ( )—the impulse response function of the milling machine—we 
could take the Laplace transform to obtain the transfer function model. There are 
many methods available for curve fitting the data to obtain the function . C t imp ( )
We will not cover curve fitting here, but we can say a few words regarding the basic 
structure of the function.
From Figure 10.27 we see that the response approaches a steady-state value:

So we expect that
C t( ) = +

5 imp ∆ C t imp ( ),
where ∆ C t imp ( ) is a function that goes to zero as t gets large. This leads us to con￾sider ∆C t imp ( ) as a sum of stable exponentials. Since the response does not oscil￾late, we might expect that the exponentials are, in fact, real exponentials,

Thus we can obtain the transfer function model of the milling machine.
The control goal is to develop a feedback system to track a desired step input. In 
this case the reference input is the desired depth-of-cut. The control goal is stated as

10.13 SYSTEM DESIGN USING CONTROL DESIGN SOFTWARE
We want to use computers, when appropriate, to assist the designer in the selection of 
the parameters of a compensator. The development of algorithms for computer-aided 
design is an important alternative approach to the trial-and-error methods consid￾ered in earlier sections. Computer programs have been developed for the selection 
of suitable parameter values for compensators based on satisfaction of frequency re￾sponse criteria such as the phase margin [3, 4].
In this section, the compensation of control systems is illustrated using fre￾quency response and s-plane methods. We will consider again the rotor winder 
design. To illustrate the use of m-file scripts in designing and developing control 
systems with good performance characteristics. We examine both the phase-lead 
and phase-lag compensators for this design example and obtain the system response 
using computer-based analysis tools.
EXAMPLE 10.15 Rotor winder control system
Consider again the rotor winder control system shown in Figure 10.21. The design 
objective is to achieve high steady-state accuracy to a ramp input. The steady-state 
error to a unit ramp input 1 2 R s( ) = s is

The performance specification of percent overshoot and settling time must be 
considered, as must the steady-state tracking error. In all likelihood, a simple gain 
will not be satisfactory, so we will also consider compensation utilizing phase-lead and 
phase-lag compensators, using both Bode plot and root locus plot design methods. 
Our approach is to develop a series of m-file scripts to aid in the compensator designs.
Consider a simple gain controller
G s K. c( ) =
Then the steady-state error is
50
e = . K ss
The larger we make K, the smaller is the steady-state error e . ss However, we must 
consider the effect that increasing K has on the transient response, as shown in 
Figure 10.30. When K = 500, our steady-state error for a ramp is 10%, but the 
percent overshoot is P O. . = 70%, and the settling time is approximately Ts = 8 s 
for a step input. We consider this to be unacceptable performance and thus turn

to compensation. The two important compensator types that we consider are 
phase-lead and phase-lag compensators.
First, we try a phase-lead compensator
G s , K s z
s p c( ) ( ) = +
+
where z p < The phase-lead compensator will give us the capability to . improve 
the transient response. We will use a frequency-domain approach to design the 
phase-lead compensator.
We want a steady-state error of ess ≤ 10% to a ramp input and Kυ = 10. In 
addition to the steady-state specifications, we want to meet certain performance 
specifications: (1) settling time (with a 2% criterion) T ≤ 3 s, s and (2) percent 
overshoot for a step input P O. . ≤ 10%. Solving for ζ and ωn using
ζω . . = = 100 exp− − ζπ ζ 10 and = = 4 3 1 2
P O Ts
n
yields ζ = 0.59 and ωn = 2.26. We thus obtain the phase margin requirement:
0.01 φpm 60°. ζ = ≈
The steps leading to the final design are as follows:
1. Obtain the uncompensated system Bode plot with K = 500, and compute the phase 
margin.
2. Determine the amount of necessary phase lead φm.
3. Evaluate α from sin φ α m = − ( )1 1 ( ) α + .
4. Compute 10 log α and find the frequency ωm on the uncompensated Bode plot 
where the magnitude curve is equal to −10 log  . α
5. In the neighborhood of ωm on the uncompensated Bode plot draw a line through 
the 0-dB point at ωm with slope equal to the current slope plus 20 dB/decade. 
Locate the intersection of the line with the uncompensated Bode plot to determine 
the phase-lead compensation zero location. Then calculate the phase-lead compen￾sator pole location as p z = α .
6. Obtain the compensated Bode plot and check the phase margin. Repeat any steps if 
necessary.
7. Raise the gain to account for the attenuation 1 . α
8. Verify the final design with simulation using step function inputs, and repeat any 
design steps if necessary.
We use three scripts in the design. The design scripts are shown in Figures 10.31–10.33. 
The script in Figure 10.31 is for the Bode plot of the uncompensated system. The script 
in Figure 10.32 is for the detailed Bode plot of the compensated system. The script in 
Figure 10.33 is for the step response analysis. The final phase-lead compensator design is
1800 3.5
25

s c( ) ( ) = +

where K = 1800 was selected after iteratively using the m-file script.
M10_DORF2374_14_GE_C10.indd 776 15/09/21 8:48 AMSection 10.13 System Design Using Control Design Software 777
The settling time and percent overshoot specifications are satisfied, but Kυ = 5,
resulting in a 20% steady-state error to a ramp input. It is possible to continue the 
design iteration and refine the compensator somewhat, although it should be clear 
that the phase-lead compensator has added phase margin and improved the tran￾sient response as anticipated.
To reduce the steady-state error, we can consider the phase-lag compensator, 
which has the form
G s , K s z
s p c( ) ( ) = +
+
where p z < . We will use a root locus approach to design the phase-lag compen￾sator, although it can be done using a Bode plot as well. The desired root location 
region of the dominant roots is specified by
ζ ω = = 0.59 and n 2.26.

The steps in the design are as follows:
1. Obtain the root locus of the uncompensated system.
2. Locate suitable root locations on the uncompensated system that lie in the region 
defined by ζ = 0.59 and ωn = 2.26.
3. Calculate the loop gain at the desired root location and the system error constant, 
Kυ . ,unc
4. Compute α = K K υ υ ,comp ,unc, where 10. Kυ, comp =
5. With α known, determine suitable locations of the compensator pole and zero so 
that the compensated root locus still passes through the desired location.
6. Verify with simulation and repeat any steps if necessary.
The design methodology is illustrated in Figures 10.34–10.36. Using the rlocfind 
function, we can compute the gain K associated with the roots of our choice on the 
uncompensated root locus that lie in the performance region. We then compute α
to ensure that we achieve the desired Kυ. We place the lag compensator pole and 
zero to avoid affecting the uncompensated root locus. In Figure 10.35, the phase-lag 
compensator pole and zero are very near the origin, at z = −0.1 and p = −0.01.

Table 10.2). Then the settling time is
ωn s T = 4.82.
Since we want a settling time T ≤ 50 ms, s we will use ωn = 120. Then we expect 
T = 40 ms. s Therefore, the denominator of Equation (10.91) is

10.15 SUMMARY
In this chapter, we have considered several alternative approaches to the design of 
feedback control systems. In the first two sections, we discussed the concepts of de￾sign and compensation and noted the several design cases. Then we examined the 
possibility of introducing cascade compensators within the feedback loops of control 
systems. The cascade compensators are useful for altering the shape of the root locus 
or frequency response of a system. The phase-lead compensator and the phase-lag 
compensator were considered in detail as candidates for system compensators. Then 
system compensation was studied by using a phase-lead compensator on the Bode 
plot and the root locus. We noted that the phase-lead compensator increases the 
phase margin of the system and thus provides additional stability. When the design 
specifications include an error constant, the design of a phase-lead compensator is 
more readily accomplished on the Bode plot. Alternatively, when an error constant is 
not specified but the settling time and percent overshoot for a step input are specified, 
the design of a phase-lead compensator is more readily carried out on the s-plane. 
When large error constants are specified for a feedback system, it is usually easier 
to compensate the system by using integration (phase-lag) compensators. We also 
noted that the phase-lead compensation increases the system bandwidth, whereas 
the phase-lag compensation decreases the system bandwidth. The bandwidth may 
often be an important factor when noise is present at the input and generated within 
the system. Also, we noted that a satisfactory system is obtained when the asymptotic 
course for magnitude of the compensated system crosses the 0-dB line with a slope 
of −20  dB decade. The characteristics of the phase-lead and phase-lag compensa￾tors are summarized in Table 10.6. Operational amplifier circuits for phase-lead and 
phase-lag and for PI and PD compensators are summarized in Table 10.7 [1].

Phase-Lead Phase-Lag
Approach Addition of phase-lead angle near cross￾over frequency on Bode plot. Add lead 
compensator to yield desired dominant 
roots in s-plane.
Addition of phase-lag to yield an increased 
error constant while maintaining desired 
dominant roots in s-plane or phase margin 
on Bode plot
Results 1. Increases system bandwidth
2. Increases gain at higher frequencies
1. Decreases system bandwidth
Advantages 1. Yields desired response
2. Improves dynamic response
1. Suppresses high-frequency noise
2. Reduces steady-state error
Disadvantages 1. Requires additional amplifier gain
2. Increases bandwidth and thus 
susceptibility to noise
1. Slows down transient response
Applications 1. When fast transient response is desired 1. When error constants are specified
Situations not 
applicable
1. When phase decreases rapidly near 
crossover frequency
1. When no low-frequency range exists where 
phase is equal to desired phase margin

be considered to be proportional to the signal V(s) so 
that . T s( ) = K V2 ( )s The loop gain may be selected by 
the designer in order to provide a suitable damping.

Design a compensator G s c( ) so that the response to 
a step input has a percent overshoot of P O. ≤ 10%.
P10.4 Magnetic particle clutches are useful actuator de￾vices for high power requirements because they can 
typically provide a 200-W mechanical power output. 
The particle clutches provide a high torque-to-inertia 
ratio and fast time-constant response. A particle 
clutch positioning system for nuclear reactor rods is 
shown in Figure P10.4. The motor drives two counter￾rotating clutch housings. The clutch housings are 
geared through parallel gear trains, and the direction 
of the servo output is dependent on the clutch that 
is energized. The time constant of a 200-W clutch is 
τ  1 = 10 s. The constants are such that K nT J = 1.
We want the percent overshoot for a step input to be 
P O. . ≤ 20%. Design a compensator so that the system 
is adequately stabilized. The settling time (with a 2% 
criterion) of the system should be T ≤ 7 s s .
P10.5 A stabilized precision rate table uses a precision 
tachometer and a DC direct-drive torque motor, as 
shown in Figure P10.5. We want to maintain a high 
steady-state accuracy for the speed control. To obtain 
a zero steady-state error for a step command design, 
select a proportional plus integral compensator. Select 
the appropriate gain constants so that the system has a 
percent overshoot of P O. . = 15% and a settling time 
(with a 2% criterion) of Ts ≤ 2s.
P10.6 Repeat Problem P10.5 by using a phase-lead com￾pensator and compare the results.
P10.7 A chemical reactor process whose production rate 
is a function of catalyst addition is shown in block 
diagram form in Figure P10.7 [10]. The time delay is 
T = 50 s, and the time constant τ is approximately 40 
s. The gain of the process is K = 1. Design a compen￾sator using Bode plot methods in order to provide a 
suitable system response. We want to have a steady￾state error less than 0.10A for a step input R s( ) = A s. 
For the system with the compensation added, estimate 
the settling time of the system.
P10.8 A numerical path-controlled machine turret lathe 
is an interesting problem in attaining sufficient ac￾curacy [2, 23]. A block diagram of a turret lathe con￾trol system is shown in Figure P10.8. The gear ratio is 
0.2,  10 , = = −3 n J and 2.0 10 . = × −2 b It is necessary 
M10_DORF2374_14_GE_C10.indd 793 15/09/21 8:49 AM794 Chapter 10 The Design of Feedback Control Systems
to attain an accuracy of 5 10  in., × −4 and therefore 
a steady-state position accuracy of 2.5% is specified 
for a ramp input. Design a cascade compensator to 
be inserted before the silicon-controlled rectifiers in 
order to provide a response to a step command with 
a percent overshoot of P O. . ≤ 5%. A suitable damp￾ing ratio for this system is ζ = 0.7. The gain of the 
silicon-controlled rectifiers is KR = 5. Design a suit￾able phase-lag compensator.
P10.9 The Avemar ferry, shown in Figure P10.9(a), is a 
large 670-ton ferry hydrofoil built for Mediterranean 
ferry service. It is capable of 45 knots (52 mph) [29]. 
The boat’s appearance, like its performance, derives 
from the innovative design of the narrow “wavepierc￾ing” hulls which move through the water like racing 
shells. Between the hulls is a third quasihull which 
gives additional buoyancy in rough seas. Loaded with 
900 passengers and crew, and a mix of cars, buses, and 
freight cars trucks, one of the boats can carry almost 
its own weight. The Avemar is capable of operating 
in seas with waves up to 8 ft in amplitude at a speed 
of 40 knots as a result of an automatic stabilization 
control system. Stabilization is achieved by means of 
flaps on the main foils and the adjustment of the aft 
foil. The stabilization control system maintains a level 
flight through rough seas. Thus, a system that mini￾mizes deviations from a constant lift force or, equiv￾alently, that minimizes the pitch angle θ( )t has been 
designed. A block diagram of the lift control system 
is shown in Figure P10.9(b). The desired response of 
the system to wave disturbance is a constant-level 
travel of the craft. Establish a set of reasonable spec￾ifications and design a compensator G s c( ) so that the 
performance of the system is suitable. Assume that 
the disturbance is due to waves with a frequency 
ω = 6 rad . s

P10.13 Materials testing requires the design of control 
systems that can faithfully reproduce normal speci￾men operating environments over a range of speci￾men parameters [23]. From the control system design 
viewpoint, a materials-testing machine system can 
be considered a servomechanism in which we want 
to have the load waveform track the reference signal. 
The system is shown in Figure P10.13.
(a) With G s K, c( ) = choose K so that a phase mar￾gin of P M. . = 45° is achieved. Determine the 
system bandwidth for this design.
(b) The additional requirement introduced is that 
the velocity constant Kυ be equal to 1. Design 
a lag compensator so that the phase margin is 
P M. . = 45° and K = 1. υ
P10.14 For the system described in Problem P10.13, the 
goal is to achieve a phase margin of P M. . = 45° with 
the additional requirement that the time to settle (to 
within 2% of the final value) is Ts ≤ 10 s. Design a 
phase-lead compensator to meet the specifications. 
As before, we require K = 1. υ
P10.15 A robot with an extended arm has a heavy load, 
whose effect is a disturbance, as shown in Figure 
P10.15 [22]. Let R s( ) = 0 and design G s c ( ) so that 
the maximum value of the disturbance response is 
less than 0.25 and the steady-state error to a unit step 
disturbarce is zero.
P10.16 A driver and car may be represented by the sim￾plified model shown in Figure P10.16 [17]. The goal is 
to have the speed adjust to a step input with a percent 
overshoot of P O. . ≤ 10% and a settling time (with a 
2% criterion) of Ts = 1 s. Select a proportional plus 
integral (PI) controller to yield these specifications. 
For the selected controller, determine the actual 
response (a) for G s p( ) = 1 and (b) with a prefilter 
G s p( ) that removes the zero from the closed-loop 
transfer function T s( ).

P10.18 NASA is developing remote manipulators that 
can be used to extend the hand and the power of hu￾mankind through space by means of radio. A concept 
of a remote manipulator is shown in Figure P10.18(a) 
[11, 22]. The closed-loop control is shown schemati￾cally in Figure P10.18(b). Assuming an average dis￾tance of 238,855 miles from Earth to the Moon, the 
time delay T in transmission of a communication sig￾nal is 1.28 s. The operator uses a control stick to con￾trol remotely the manipulator placed on the Moon to 
assist in geological experiments, and the TV display 
to access the response of the manipulator. The time 
constant of the manipulator is 1 4 second.
(a) Set the gain K1 so that the system has a phase 
margin of P M. . = 30°. Evaluate the percentage 
steady-state error for this system for a step input. (b) 
To reduce the steady-state error for a position com￾mand input to 5%, add a lag compensation network 
in cascade with . K1 Plot the step response.
P10.19 There have been significant developments in 
the application of robotics technology to nuclear 
power plant maintenance problems. Thus far, robot￾ics technology in the nuclear industry has been used 
primarily on spent-fuel reprocessing and waste man￾agement. The industry is applying the technology to 
such areas as primary containment inspection, reac￾tor maintenance, facility decontamination, and acci￾dent recovery activities. These developments suggest 
that the application of remotely operated devices can 
significantly reduce radiation exposure to personnel 
and improve maintenance-program performance.
Currently, an operational robotic system is 
under development to address particular operational 
problems within a nuclear power plant. This device, 
IRIS (Industrial Remote Inspection System), is a 
general-purpose surveillance system that conducts 
particular inspection and handling tasks with the 
goal of significantly reducing personnel exposure 
to high radiation fields [12]. The device is shown in

P10.24 The stability and performance of the rotation of 
a robot (similar to waist rotation) presents a challeng￾ing control problem. The system requires high gains in 
order to achieve high resolution; yet a large percent 
overshoot of the transient response cannot be toler￾ated. The block diagram of an electrohydraulic system 
for rotation control is shown in Figure P10.24 [15].
We want to have Kυ = 20 for the compensated

P10.25 The possibility of overcoming wheel friction,

to transport materials. Most AGVs require some type 
of guide path. The steering stability of the guidance 
control system has not been fully solved. The slight 
“snaking” of the AGV about the track generally has 
been acceptable, although it indicates instability of 
the steering guidance control system [9].
Most AGVs have a specification of maximum 
speed of about 1 m/s, although in practice they are 
usually operated at half that speed. In a fully auto￾mated manufacturing environment, there should be 
few personnel in the production area; therefore, the 
AGV should be able to be run at full speed. As the 
speed of the AGV increases, so does the difficulty in 
designing stable and smooth tracking controls.
A steering system for an AGV is shown in 
Figure P10.30, where 40 ms τ1 = and 1 ms. τ2 = We 
require that the velocity constant Kυ be 100 so that 
the steady-state error for a ramp input will be 1% of 
the slope of the ramp. Neglect τ2 and design a lead 
compensator so that the phase margin is
45° ≤ ≤ P M. . 65°.
Attempt to obtain the two limiting cases for phase 
margin, and compare your results for the two designs 
by determining the actual percent overshoot and set￾tling time for a step input.
P10.31 For the system of Problem P10.30, use a phase-lag 
compensator and attempt to achieve a phase margin 
of P M. . = 50°. Determine the actual percent over￾shoot and peak time for the compensated system.
P10.32 When a motor drives a flexible structure, the 
structure’s natural frequencies, as compared to the 
bandwidth of the servodrive, determine the contribu￾tion of the structural flexibility to the errors of the 
resulting motion. In current industrial robots, the 
drives are often relatively slow, and the structures 
are relatively rigid, so that overshoots and other er￾rors are caused mainly by the servodrive. However, 
depending on the accuracy required, the structural 
deflections of the driven members can become sig￾nificant. Structural flexibility must be considered the 
major source of motion errors in space structures 
and manipulators. Because of weight restrictions in 
space, large arm lengths result in flexible structures. 
Furthermore, future industrial robots should require 
lighter and more flexible manipulators.
To investigate the effects of structural flexibil￾ity and how different control schemes can reduce 
unwanted oscillations, an experimental apparatus 
was constructed consisting of a DC motor driving 
a slender aluminum beam. The purpose of the ex￾periments was to identify simple and effective con￾trol strategies to deal with the motion errors that 
occur when a servomotor is driving a very flexible 
structure [13].
The experimental apparatus is shown in Figure 
P10.32(a), and the control system is shown in Figure 
P10.32(b). The goal is that the system will have a Kυ
of 100. (a) When G s K, c( ) = determine K and ob￾tain the Bode plot. Find the phase margin and gain 
margin. (b) Using the Nichols chart, find ωr p , M ω,
and ωB. (c) Select a compensator so that the phase 
margin is P M. . ≥ 35° and find ωr p , M ω, and ωB for 
the compensated system.
P10.33 Consider the block diagram of the extender 
robot system shown in Figure P10.33 [14]. The goal is 
that the compensated system will have a velocity con￾stant Kυ equal to 80, so that the settling time (with a 
2% criterion) will be Ts = 1.6 s, and that the percent 
overshoot will be P O. . = 16%, so that the dominant 
roots have a ζ = 0.5. Determine a lead-lag compen￾sator using root locus methods.

DP10.3 NASA has identified the need for large deploy￾able space structures, which will be constructed of 
lightweight materials and will contain large numbers 
of joints or structural connections. This need is ev￾ident for programs such as the space station. These 
deployable space structures may have precision shape 
requirements and a need for vibration suppression 
during in-orbit operations [16].
One such structure is the mast flight system, 
which is shown in Figure DP10.3(a). The intent of 
the system is to provide an experimental test bed for 
controls and dynamics. The basic element in the mast 
flight system is a 60.7-m-long truss beam structure, 
which is attached to the shuttle orbiter. Included at 
the tip of the truss structure are the primary actuators 
and collocated sensors. A deployment/retraction sub￾system, which also secures the stowed beam package 
during launch and landing, is provided.
The system uses a large motor to move the structure 
and has the block diagram shown in Figure DP10.3(b). 
The goal is a percent overshoot to a step response of 
P O. . ≤ 20%; thus, we estimate the system ζ = 0.5 and 
the required phase margin as P M. . = 50°. Design for 
0.75 < < K 2.0 and record the percent overshoot, rise 
time, and phase margin for selected gains.
DP10.4 A high-speed train is under development in Texas 
[21] with a design based on the French Train à Grande 
Vitesse (TGV). Train speeds of 186 miles per hour 
are foreseen. To achieve these speeds on tight curves, 
the train may use independent axles combined with 
the  ability to tilt the train. Hydraulic cylinders con￾necting the passenger compartments to their wheeled 
bogies allow the train to lean into curves like a motor￾cycle. A pendulum like device on the leading bogie of 
each car senses when it is entering a curve and feeds 
this information to the hydraulic system. Tilting does 
not make the train safer, but it does make passengers 
more comfortable.

Consider the tilt control shown in Figure DP10.4. 
Design a compensator G s c( ) for a step-input command 
so that the percent overshoot is P O. . ≤ 10% and the 
settling time (with a 2% criterion) Ts ≤ 1 s. We also 
desire that the steady-state error for a velocity (ramp) 
input be less than 0.2A, where r t( ) = > At, t 0. Verify 
the results for the design.
DP10.5 High-performance tape transport systems are de￾signed with a small capstan to pull the tape past the 
read/write heads and with take-up reels turned by DC 
motors. The tape is to be controlled at speeds up to 
200 inches per second, with start-up as fast as possi￾ble, while preventing permanent distortion of the tape. 
Since we wish to control the speed and the tension of 
the tape, we will use a DC tachometer for the speed 
sensor and a potentiometer for the position sensor. We 
will use a DC motor for the actuator. Then the linear 
model for the system is a unity feedback system with

The specifications for the system are (1) settling 
time of Ts ≤ 12 ms, (2) a percent overshoot to a step 
position command of P O. . ≤ 10%, and (3) a steady￾state velocity error of less than 0.5%. Determine a 
compensator to achieve these specifications.
DP10.6 The past years have witnessed a significant engine 
model-building activity in the automotive industry in a 
category referred to as “control-oriented” or “control 
design” models. These models contain representations 
of the throttle body, engine pumping phenomena, in￾duction process dynamics, fuel system, engine torque 
generation, and rotating inertia.
The control of the fuel-to-air ratio in an automobile 
carburetor became of prime importance as automakers 
worked to reduce exhaust-pollution emissions. Thus, 
auto engine designers turned to the feedback control of 
the fuel-to-air ratio. Operation of an engine at or near 
a particular air-to-fuel ratio requires management of 
both air and fuel flow into the manifold system. The fuel 
command is considered the input and the engine speed 
is considered the output [9, 10].
The block diagram of the system is shown in 
Figure DP10.6, where T = 0.066 s. A compensator 
is required to yield zero steady-state error for a step 
input and a percent overshoot of P O. . ≤ 10%. We 
also desire that the settling time (with a 2% criterion) 
of Ts ≤ 10 s.
DP10.7 A high-performance jet airplane is shown in Figure 
DP10.7(a), and the roll-angle control system is shown 
in Figure DP10.7(b). Design a controller G s c ( ) so that 
the step response is well behaved and the steady-state 
error is zero. That is, P.O. ≤ 10% and Ts ≤ 2 s.
DP10.8 A simple closed-loop control system has been 
proposed to demonstrate proportional-integral (PI) 
control of a windmill radiometer [27]. The windmill ra￾diometer is shown in Figure DP10.8(a) and the control 
system is shown in Figure DP10.8(b). The variable to 
be controlled is the angular velocity ω of the windmill 
radiometer whose vanes turn when exposed to infra￾red radiation. An experimental setup using a reflex￾ive photoelectric sensor and basic electronic circuitry 
makes possible the design and implementation of a 
high performance control system.
Assume τ = 20 s. Design a PI controller so that 
the system achieves a deadbeat response with a set￾tling time of T ≤ 25 s s .

PREVIEW
The design of controllers utilizing state feedback is the subject of this chapter. We 
first present a system test for controllability and observability. Using the powerful 
notion of state variable feedback, we introduce the pole placement design tech￾nique. Ackermann’s formula can be used to determine the state variable feedback 
gain matrix to place the system poles at the desired locations. The closed-loop sys￾tem pole locations can be arbitrarily placed if and only if the system is controllable. 
When the full state is not available for feedback, we introduce an observer. The 
observer design process is described and the applicability of Ackermann’s formula 
is established. The state variable compensator is obtained by connecting the full￾state feedback law to the observer. We consider optimal control system design and 
then describe the use of internal model design to achieve prescribed steady-state 
response to selected input commands. The chapter concludes by revisiting the 
Sequential Design Example: Disk Drive Read System.

11.1 INTRODUCTION
The time-domain method, employing state variables, can be used to design a suit￾able compensation scheme for a control system. Typically, we are interested in 
controlling the system with a control signal u( )t that is a function of several mea￾surable state variables. Then we develop a state variable controller that operates on 
the information available in measured form. This type of system compensation is 
quite useful for system optimization and will be considered in this chapter.
State variable design typically comprises three steps. In the first step, 
we assume that all the state variables are measurable and utilize them in a 
full-state feedback control law. Full-state feedback is usually not practical 
because it is not possible (in general) to measure all the states. In practice, 
only certain states (or linear combinations thereof) are measured and provided 
as system outputs. The second step in state variable design is to construct an 
observer to estimate the states that are not directly measured and available as 
outputs. Observers can either be full-state observers or reduced-order observ￾ers. Reduced-order observers account for the fact that certain states are already 
available as system outputs; hence they do not need to be estimated [26]. In this 
chapter, we consider only full-state observers. The final step in the design process 
is to appropriately connect the observer to the full-state feedback control law. 
It is common to refer to the state-variable controller (full-state control law plus 
observer) as a compensator. The state variable design yields a compensator of 
the form depicted in Figure 11.1. Additionally, it is possible to consider non-zero 
reference inputs to the state variable compensator to complete the design. All 
three steps in the design process are discussed in the subsequent sections, as well 
as how to incorporate the reference inputs.
11.2 CONTROLLABILITY AND OBSERVABILITY
A key question that arises in the design of state variable compensators is whether 
or not all the poles of the closed-loop system can be arbitrarily placed in the com￾plex plane. Recall that the poles of the closed-loop system are equivalent to the

eigenvalues of the system matrix in state variable format. As we shall see, if the 
system is controllable and observable, then we can accomplish the design objec￾tive of placing the poles precisely at the desired locations to meet the performance 
specifications. Full-state feedback design commonly relies on pole-placement tech￾niques [2, 27]. Pole placement is discussed more fully in Section 11.3. It is important 
to note that a system must be completely controllable and completely observable 
to allow the flexibility to place all the closed-loop system poles arbitrarily. The con￾cepts of controllability and observability (discussed in this section) were introduced 
by Kalman in the 1960s [28–30]. Rudolph Kalman was a central figure in the devel￾opment of mathematical systems theory upon which much of the subject of state 
variable methods rests. Kalman is well known for his role in the development of 
the so-called Kalman filter, which was instrumental in the successful Apollo moon 
landings [31, 32].
A system is completely controllable if there exists an unconstrained 
control u t( ) that can transfer any initial state x( ) t0 to any other desired 
location x t( ) in a finite time, t t 0 ≤ ≤ T.
For the system
x A ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( ),
we can determine whether the system is controllable by examining the algebraic 
condition
rank B AB A2 1 B A   . B n  … n
 
 − = (11.1)
The matrix A is an n n × matrix and B is an n×1 matrix. For multi-input systems, B
can be n m× , where m is the number of inputs.
For a single-input, single-output system, the controllability matrix Pc is de￾scribed in terms of A and B as
P B c = …  AB A B2 1   , A B n
 
 − (11.2)
which is an n n × matrix. Therefore, if the determinant of Pc is nonzero, the system 
is controllable [11].
Advanced state variable design techniques can handle situations wherein the 
system is not completely controllable, but where the states (or linear combinations 
thereof) that cannot be controlled are inherently stable. These systems are clas￾sified as stabilizable. If a system is completely controllable, it is also stabilizable. 
The Kalman state-space decomposition provides a mechanism for partitioning the 
state-space so that it becomes apparent which states (or state combinations) are 
controllable and which are not [12, 18]. The controllable subspace is thus exposed, 
and if the system is stabilizable, the control system design can, in theory, proceed. In 
this chapter, we consider only completely controllable systems.

As discussed in this section, advanced state variable design techniques can han￾dle situations wherein the system is not completely controllable, as long as the sys￾tem is stabilizable. These same techniques can handle cases wherein the system is 
not completely observable, but where the states (or linear combinations thereof) 
that cannot be observed are inherently stable. These systems are classified as 
detectable. If a system is completely observable, it is also detectable. The Kalman 
state-space decomposition provides a mechanism for partitioning the state-space so 
that it becomes apparent which states (or state combinations) are observable and 
which are not [12, 18]. The unobservable subspace is thus exposed, and if the system 
is detectable, the control system design can, in theory, proceed. In this chapter, we 
consider only completely observable systems. The approach to state-variable design 
involves first verifying that the system under consideration is completely control￾lable and completely observable. If so, the pole placement design technique consid￾ered here can provide acceptable closed-loop system performance.

allow us to determine x1 ( ) 0 and x2 ( ) 0 independently. Consequently, the system is 
not observable. ■
11.3 FULL-STATE FEEDBACK CONTROL DESIGN
In this section, we consider full-state variable feedback to achieve the desired pole lo￾cations of the closed-loop system. The first step in the state variable design process 
requires us to assume that all the states are available for feedback—that is, we have 
access to the complete state x( )t for all t. Suppose the system input u t( ) is given by
u t( ) = −Kx( )t . (11.4)
Determining the gain matrix K is the objective of the full-state feedback design pro￾cedure. The beauty of the state variable design process is that the problem naturally 
separates into a full-state feedback component and an observer design component. 
These two design procedures can occur independently, and in fact, the separation 
principle provides the proof that this approach is optimal. We will show later that the 
stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed if the full-state feedback control law 
stabilizes the system (under the assumption of access to the complete state) and the 
observer is stable (the tracking error is asymptotically stable). Observers are discussed 
in Section 11.4. The full-state feedback block diagram is illustrated in Figure 11.5. 
With the system defined by the state variable model
x A ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( )
and the control feedback given by
u t( ) = −Kx( )t ,
M11_DORF2374_14_GE_C11.indd 819 31/08/21 7:56 AM820 Chapter 11 The Design of State Variable Feedback Systems
we find the closed-loop system to be
x A ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( ) = − Ax( )t t BKx A ( ) = − ( ) BK x( )t . (11.5)
The characteristic equation associated with Equation (11.5) is
det 0 ( ) λI A − − ( ) BK = .
If all the roots of the characteristic equation lie in the left half-plane, then the closed￾loop system is stable. In other words, for any initial condition x( ) t0 , it follows that
x x 0 as t . A BK t e t0 t ( ) = ( ) ( ) − → → ∞
Given the pair (A, B), we can always determine K to place all the system closed-loop 
poles in the left half-plane if and only if the system is completely controllable—that 
is, if and only if the controllability matrix Pc is full rank (for a single-input, single￾output system, full rank implies that Pc is invertible).
The addition of a reference input can be written as
u t( ) = −Kx( )t N + r t( ),
where r t( ) is the reference input. The question of reference inputs is addressed in 
Section 11.6. When r t( ) = 0 for all t t > 0, the control design problem is known 
as the regulator problem. That is, we want to compute K so that all initial con￾ditions are driven to zero in a specified fashion (as determined by the design 
specifications).
When using this state variable feedback, the roots of the characteristic equation 
are placed where the transient performance meets the desired response.

EXAMPLE 11.6 Inverted pendulum control
Consider the control of an unstable inverted pendulum balanced on a moving cart. 
We measure and utilize the state variables of the system in order to control the 
pendulum. Thus, if we want to measure the angle from vertical, θ( )t , we could use 
a potentiometer connected to the shaft of the pendulum hinge. Similarly, we could 
measure the rate of change of the angle θ( )t  by using a tachometer generator. If 
the state variables are all measured, then they can be used in a feedback control￾ler so that u t( ) = −Kx( )t , where K is the feedback matrix. The state vector x( )t
represents the state of the system; therefore, knowledge of x( )t and the equations 
describing the system dynamics provide sufficient information for control and stabi￾lization of a system [4, 5, 7].
To illustrate the use of state variable feedback, consider the unstable inverted 
pendulum and design a suitable state variable feedback control system. If we assume 
that the control input, u(t), is an acceleration signal, we can focus on the unstable 
dynamics of the pendulum. The equation of motion describing the angle, θ( )t  , from 
the vertical, is

Thus, for the system to be stable, we require that k l 2 < 0 and k g 1 > − . Hence, 
we have stabilized an unstable system by measuring the state variables x1 and x2
and using the control function u t( ) = −Kx( )t to obtain a stable system. If we wish 
to achieve a rapid response with modest overshoot, we select ωn = 10 and ζ = 0.8.

The step response would have a percent overshoot of P.O. = 1.5% and a settling 
time of Ts = 0.5 s. ■
Thus far, we have established an approach for the design of a feedback control 
system by using the state variables as the feedback variables in order to increase 
the stability of the system and obtain the desired system response. Now we face the 
task of computing the gain matrix K to place the poles at desired locations. For a 
single-input, single-output system, Ackermann’s formula is useful for determining 
the state variable feedback matrix
K = … [ ] k k 1 2   , kn

u t( ) = −Kx( )t .

11.4 OBSERVER DESIGN
In the full-state feedback design procedure discussed in Section 11.3, it was assumed 
that all the states were available for feedback at all times. This is a good assumption 
for the control law design process. Only a subset of the states are typically measur￾able and available for feedback. Having all the states available for feedback implies 
that these states are measured with a sensor or sensor combinations. The cost and 
complexity of the control system increases as the number of required sensors in￾creases. So, even in situations where extra sensors are available, it may not be cost 
effective to employ these extra sensors, if indeed, the control system design goals 
can be accomplished without them. Fortunately, if the system is completely observ￾able with a given set of outputs, then it is possible to determine (or to estimate) the 
states that are not directly measured (or observed).
According to Luenberger [26], the full-state observer for the system
x A ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( )
y t( ) = Cx( )t
is given by

x A ˆ ˆ ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( ) + − L C ( ) y t( ) xˆ( )t (11.11)
where xˆ( )t denotes the estimate of the state x( )t . The matrix L is the observer gain 
matrix and is to be determined as part of the observer design procedure. The observer is 
depicted in Figure 11.6. The observer has two inputs, u(t) and y(t), and one output, xˆ( )t .
The goal of the observer is to provide an estimate xˆ( )t so that x x ˆ( )t t → ( ) as 
t → ∞. Remember that we do not know x( ) t0 precisely; therefore we must provide 
an initial estimate xˆ( ) t0 to the observer. Define the observer estimation error as
e x ( )t t = − ( ) xˆ( )t . (11.12)
The observer design should produce an observer with the property that e( )t → 0 as 
t → ∞. One of the main results of systems theory is that if the system is completely 
observable, we can always find L so that the tracking error is asymptotically stable, 
as desired.
Taking the time-derivative of the estimation error in Equation (11.12) yields

and using the system model and the observer in Equation (11.11), we obtain
e A ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( )− − Axˆ ˆ ( )t u B L ( )t y − − ( ) ( )t t Cx( )
or
e A ( )t t = − ( ) LC e( ). (11.13)
We can guarantee that e( )t → 0 as t → ∞ for any initial tracking error e( ) t0 if the 
characteristic equation
det 0 ( ) λI A − − ( ) LC = (11.14)
has all its roots in the left half-plane. Therefore, the observer design process reduces 
to finding the matrix L such that the roots of the characteristic equation in Equation 
(11.14) lie in the left half-plane. This can always be accomplished if the system is 
completely observable; that is, if the observability matrix Po has full rank (for a 
single-input, single-output system, full rank implies that Po is invertible).

In this example, we can only directly observe the state y t( ) = x t 1 ( ). The observer 
will provide estimates of the second state x t 2 ( ).
We only consider full-state observers, which implies that the observer will 
provide estimates of all the states. We might be inclined to suppose that since 
some states are directly measured, it may be possible to design an observer that 
provides just the estimates of the states not directly measured. This is, in fact, 
possible, and the resulting observers are known as reduced-order observers [12, 
18]. However, since sensors are not noise free, even states that are directly mea￾sured are generally estimated in an effort to reduce the effect of sensor noise on 
the state estimate. The Kalman filter (which is a time-varying optimal observer) 
solves the observer problem in the presence of measurement noise (and process 
noise as well) [33, 34].
The observer design begins by checking the system observability to verify that 
an observer can be constructed to guarantee the stability of the estimation error.

characteristic equation is given by
∆ = d n ( ) λ λ + + 2 . ζω λ ωn 2 2 (11.15)

11.5 INTEGRATED FULL-STATE FEEDBACK AND OBSERVER
The state variable compensator is constructed by appropriately connecting the full￾state feedback control law (see Section 11.3) to the observer (see Section 11.4). The 
compensator is shown in Figure 11.1 (as discussed in Section 11.1). Our strategy 
was to design the state feedback control law as u t( ) = −Kx( )t , where we assumed 
that we had access to the complete state x( )t . Then we designed an observer to 
provide an estimate of the state xˆ( )t . It seems reasonable that we can employ the 
state estimate in the feedback control law in place of x( )t . In other words, we can 
consider the feedback law
u t( ) = −Kxˆ( )t . (11.18)
But is this a good strategy? The feedback gain matrix K was designed to guarantee 
stability of the closed-loop system; that is, the roots of the characteristic equation
det 0 ( ) λI A − − ( ) BK =
are in the left half-plane. Under the assumption that the complete state x( )t is avail￾able for feedback, the feedback control law (with properly designed gain matrix K) 
leads to the desired result that x( )t → 0 as t → ∞ for any initial condition x( ) t0 .
We need to verify that, when using the feedback control law in Equation (11.18), we 
retain the stability of the closed-loop system.
Consider the observer (from Section 11.4)

x A ˆ ˆ ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( ) + − L C ( ) y t( ) xˆ( )t .
Substituting the feedback law in Equation (11.18) and rearranging terms in the 
observer yields the compensator system

x A ˆ ˆ ( )t t = − ( ) BK − + LC x L ( ) y t( )
u t( ) = −Kxˆ( )t . (11.19)
Notice that the system in Equation (11.19) has the form of a state variable model 
with input y t( ) and output u t( ), as illustrated in Figure 11.8.

Computing the estimation error using the compensator in Equation (11.19) yields
   e x ( )t t = − ( ) x A ˆ ˆ ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( ) − − Ax( )t u B L ( )t y − + ( )t t LCxˆ( ),
or
e A ( )t t = − ( ) LC e( ). (11.20)
This is the same result as we obtained for the estimation error in Section 11.4. The 
estimation error does not depend on the input as seen in Equation (11.20), where 
the input terms cancel. Recall that the underlying system model is given by
x A ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( )
y t( ) = Cx( )t .
Substituting the feedback law u t( ) = −Kxˆ( )t into the system model yields
x A ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( ) = − Ax( )t t BKxˆ( ),
and with x x ˆ( )t t = − ( ) e( )t , we obtain

Recall that our goal is to verify that, with u t( ) = −Kxˆ( )t , we retain stability of the 
closed-loop system and the observer. The characteristic equation associated with 
Equation (11.22) is
∆ = ( ) λ λ det   ( ) I A − − ( ) BK det . ( ) λI A − − ( ) LC
So if the roots of det 0 ( ) λI A − − ( ) BK = lie in the left half-plane (which they do 
by design of the full-state feedback law), and if the roots of det 0 ( ) λI A − − ( ) LC =
lie in the left half-plane (which they do by design of the observer), then the overall 
system is stable. Therefore, employing the strategy of using the state estimates for 
the feedback is in fact a good strategy.
In other words, when we use u t( ) = −Kxˆ( )t where K is designed using the methods 
proposed in Section 11.3 and xˆ( )t is derived from the observer discussed in Section 11.4, 
then x( )t → 0 as t → ∞ for any initial condition x( ) t0 and e( )t → 0 as t → ∞ for 
any initial estimation error e( ) t0 . The fact that the full-state feedback law and the ob￾server can be designed independently is an illustration of the separation principle.
The design procedure is summarized as follows:
1. Determine K such that det 0 ( ) λI A − − ( ) BK = has roots in the left half-plane and 
place the poles appropriately to meet the control system design specifications. The 
ability to place the poles arbitrarily in the complex plane is guaranteed if the system is 
completely controllable.
M11_DORF2374_14_GE_C11.indd 830 31/08/21 7:56 AMSection 11.5 Integrated Full-State Feedback and Observer 831
2. Determine L such that det 0 ( ) λI A − − ( ) LC = has roots in the left half-plane and 
place the poles to achieve acceptable observer performance. The ability to place the 
observer poles arbitrarily in the complex plane is guaranteed if the system is completely 
observable.
3. Connect the observer to the full-state feedback law using
u t( ) = −Kxˆ( )t .
Compensator Transfer Function. The compensator given in Equation (11.19) can 
be given equivalently in transfer function form with input Y s( ) and output U s( ). 
Taking the Laplace transform (with zero initial conditions) of the compensator yields
s s X A ˆ ˆ ( ) = − ( ) BK − + LC X L ( )s Y( )s
KXˆ U s( ) = − ( )s ,  
and rearranging and solving for U s( ), we obtain the transfer function
U s( ) = − ( ) s Y − − ( ) − ( )s 

 

 − K I A BK LC L . 1 (11.23)
Note that the compensator transfer function itself (when viewed as a system) may 
or may not be stable. Even though A B − K is stable and A L − C is stable, it does 
not necessarily follow that A B − − K LC is stable. However, the overall closed￾loop system is stable (as we proved in the previous discussions). The controller in 
Equation (11.23) is commonly referred to as a stabilizing controller.

and det Po = ≠1 0; hence, the system is completely observable. We can now pro￾ceed with the three-step design procedure knowing that we can determine a control 
gain matrix K and observer gain matrix L to place all the closed-loop system poles 
at desired locations.
Step 1: Design the Full-State Feedback Control Law
The open-loop system poles are located at λ = − 0,  0, 10, and 10, hence the open￾loop system is unstable (there is a pole in the right half-plane). Suppose that the 
desired closed-loop system characteristic equation is given by
q a ( ) λ λ = + ( ) 2 2 2 , ζωn n λ ω + + ( ) λ λ 2 + b
where we choose (1) the pair ( ) ζ ω,   n so that these poles are the dominant 
poles, and (2) the pair (a, b) farther in the left half-plane so as not to domi￾nate the response. To obtain a settling time less than 10 seconds with low over￾shoot, we can select ( ) ζ ω,   n = ( ) 0.8,  0.5 . Then, we choose a separation factor 
of 20 between the dominant poles and the remaining poles, from which it fol￾lows that ( ) a b,   = ( ) 16,  100 . Figure 11.9 shows the pole zero map for the system 
design. The separation factor between the dominant and nondominant poles is a 
M11_DORF2374_14_GE_C11.indd 832 31/08/21 7:56 AMSection 11.5 Integrated Full-State Feedback and Observer 833
parameter that can be varied as part of the design process. The larger the sepa￾ration selected, the further left in the left half-plane the nondominant poles will 
be placed, and hence the larger the required control law gains. The desired roots 
are then specified to be
det 8 ( ) λ λ I A − − ( ) BK = + ( ) ± + j j 6 ( ) λ 0.4 ± 0.3 .
The poles at λ = −0.4 ± 0.3j are the dominant poles. Using Ackermann’s formula 
yields the feedback gain matrix

 K  2.2509 7.5631 169.0265 14.0523 .
Step 2: Observer Design
The observer needs to provide an estimate of the states that cannot be directly 
observed. The goal is to achieve an accurate estimate as fast as possible without 
resulting in too large a gain matrix L. How large is too large depends on the 
problem under consideration. In particular, if there are significant levels of mea￾surement noise (this is sensor dependent), then the magnitude of the observer 
matrix should be kept correspondingly low to avoid amplifying the measurement 
noise. The trade-off between the time required to obtain accurate observer per￾formance and the amount of noise amplification is a primary design issue. For 
design purposes, we will attempt to insure a separation of the desired closed￾loop system poles and the observer poles on the order of 2 to 10 (as illustrated 
in Figure 11.9). The desired observer characteristic equation is selected to be of 
the form

where the constants c1 and c2 are appropriately chosen. As a first attempt, 
we select c1 = 32 and c2 = 711.11. These values should produce a response 
to an initial state estimation error that settles in less than 0.5 second with mini￾mal percent overshoot. Using Ackermann’s formula from Section 11.3, we de￾termine that the observer gain that achieves the desired observer pole locations

Step 3: Compensator Design
The final step in the design is to connect the observer to the full-state feedback con￾trol law via u t( ) = −Kxˆ( )t . As proved earlier, the closed-loop system will remain 
stable; however, we should not expect the closed-loop performance to be as good 
when using the state estimate from the observer. This makes sense, since it takes 
a finite amount of time for the observer to provide accurate state estimates. The 
response of the inverted pendulum design is shown in Figure 11.10. The pendulum 
is initially stationary at θ( ) t0 = 5.72°, and the cart is initially not moving. The initial 
state estimate in the observer is set to zero.
In Figure 11.10(a), we see that, indeed, the pendulum is balanced to the ver￾tical in under 4 seconds. The response of the compensator (with the observer) is 
more oscillatory than without the observer in the loop—but this difference in per￾formance is expected, since it takes about 0.4 second for the observer to converge to 
a minimal state tracking error, as seen in Figure 11.10(b). ■

11.6 REFERENCE INPUTS
The feedback strategies discussed in the previous sections (and illustrated in 
Figure  11.1) were constructed without consideration of reference inputs. We re￾ferred to the design of state variable feedback compensators without reference in￾puts (i.e., r t( ) = 0 ) as regulators. Since command following is also an important 
aspect of feedback design, it is important to consider how we can introduce a refer￾ence signal into the state variable feedback compensator. There are, in fact, many 
different techniques that can be employed to permit the tracking of a reference 
input. Two of the more common methods are discussed in this section.
The general form of the state variable feedback compensator is

x A ˆ ˆ ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t   ( ) + + L M y t( ) r t( )
u t( ) = + u t ( ) Nr( )t t = −Kxˆ( ) + Nr( )t , (11.24)
where y y  = − ( )t t Cxˆ( ) and u t ( ) = −Kxˆ( )t . The state variable compensator with 
the reference input is illustrated in Figure 11.11. Notice that when M = 0 and 
N = 0, the compensator in Equation (11.24) reduces to the regulator described in 
Section 11.5 and illustrated in Figure 11.1.
The compensator key design parameters required to implement the command 
tracking of the reference input are M and N. When the reference input is a scalar 
signal (i.e., a single input), the parameter M is a column vector of length n, where n
is the length of the state vector, x( )t and N is a scalar. Here, we consider two pos￾sibilities for selecting M and N. In the first case, we select M and N so that the esti￾mation error e( )t is independent of the reference input r t( ). In the second case, we 
select M and N so that the tracking error y t( )− r t( ) is used as an input to the com￾pensator. These two cases will result in implementations wherein the compensator 
is in the feedback loop in the first case and in the forward loop in the second case.
Employing the generalized compensator in Equation (11.24), the estimation 
error is found to be described by the differential equation
   e x ( )t t = − ( ) x A ˆ ˆ ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( ) − − Ax( )t u B L   ( )t y − − ( )t r M ( )t ,

or
e A ( )t t = − ( ) LC e B ( ) + − ( ) N M r t( ).
Suppose that we select
M B = N. (11.25)
Then the corresponding estimation error is given by
e A ( )t t = − ( ) LC e( ).
In this case, the estimation error is independent of the reference input r t( ). This is 
the identical result found in Section 11.4, where we considered the observer design 
assuming no reference inputs. The remaining task is to determine a suitable value 
of N, since the value of M follows from Equation (11.25). For example, we might 
choose N to obtain a zero steady-state tracking error to a step input r t( ).
With M B = N, we find that the compensator is given by

x A ˆ ˆ ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( ) + Ly t ( )
u t( ) = −Kxˆ( )t N + r t( ).
This implementation of the state variable compensator is illustrated in Figure 11.12.
As an alternative approach, suppose that we select N = 0 and M = −L. Then, 
the compensator in Equation (11.24) is given by

x A ˆ ˆ ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( ) + − L L y t ( ) r t( )
u t( ) = −Kxˆ( )t ,  
which can be rewritten as

x A ˆ ˆ ( )t t = − ( ) BK − + LC x L ( ) ( ) y t( ) − r t( )
u t( ) = −Kxˆ( )t .
In this formulation, the observer is driven by the tracking error y t( )− r t( ). The ref￾erence input tracking implementation is illustrated in Figure 11.13.
Notice that in the first implementation (with M B = N ) the compensator is in 
the feedback loop, whereas in the second implementation (N = 0 and M L = − )

the compensator is in the forward path. These two implementations are representa￾tive of the possibilities open to control system designers when considering reference 
inputs.
Depending on the choice of N and M, other implementations are possible. For 
example, Section 11.8 presents a method of tracking reference inputs with guaran￾teed steady-state tracking errors using internal model design techniques.
11.7 OPTIMAL CONTROL SYSTEMS
The design of optimal control systems is an important function of control engineer￾ing. The purpose of design is to realize a system with practical components that will 
provide the desired performance. The desired performance can be readily stated in 
terms of time-domain performance indices, such as the integral performance mea￾sures. The design of a system can be based on minimizing a performance index, such 
as the integral of the squared error (ISE). Systems that are adjusted to provide a 
minimum performance index are called optimal control systems. In this section, we 
consider the design of an optimal control system that is described by a state variable 
formulation.
The performance of a control system, written in terms of the state variables of 
a system, can be expressed as
,   ,   , 0 J g x u t dt ∫ = ( ) ∞
(11.26)
where x( )t is the state vector, and u( )t is the control vector. In this section, we 
consider the design of optimal control systems using state variable feedback and 
error-squared performance indices [1–3].
Consider the system
x A ( )t t = + x B ( ) u( )t . (11.27)
We will select a feedback controller as
u t( ) = −Kx( )t , (11.28)
where K is an 1× n matrix.
Substituting Equation (11.28) into Equation (11.27) yields
x A ( )t t = − x B ( ) Kx( )t t = Hx( ), (11.29)
where H is the n n × matrix resulting from the addition of the elements of A and 
−BK.

 Then the specific form of the perfor￾mance index, in terms of the state vector, is
∫ = ( ) ( ) ∞
J t x x t dt T . 0 (11.33)
The general form of the performance index (Equation 11.26) incorporates a term 
with u t( ) that we have not included at this point, but we will do so later in this section.
To obtain the minimum value of J, we postulate the existence of an exact dif￾ferential so that
( ) x P ( ) x x ( ) = − ( )x( ) d
dt
t t t t T T   , (11.34)
where P is to be determined. A symmetric P matrix will be used to simplify the 
algebra without any loss of generality. Then, for a symmetric P matrix, p p ij ji = .
Completing the differentiation indicated on the left-hand side of Equation (11.34), 
we have
( ) x P ( ) x x ( ) = +   ( )Px( ) x P ( ) x( ) d

t t t t t t T T T   . (11.35)
Substituting Equation (11.29) into Equation (11.35), we obtain

then Equation (11.36) becomes
( ) x P ( ) x x ( ) = − ( )x( ) d
dt
t t t t T T   , (11.38)
which is the exact differential we are seeking. Substituting Equation (11.38) into 
Equation (11.33), we obtain

dt
t t dt t t T T Px T     0 0 . 0 0 (11.39)
In the evaluation of the limit at t = ∞, we have assumed that the system is stable, 
and hence x( ) ∞ = 0, as desired. Therefore, to minimize the performance index J, 
we consider the two equations
∫ = = ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ∞
J t x x t dt x Px T T 0 0
0 (11.40)
and
H PT + = PH −I. (11.41)
The design steps are then as follows:
1. Determine the matrix P that satisfies Equation (11.41), where H is known.
2. Minimize J by determining the minimum of Equation (11.40) by adjusting one or more 
unspecified system parameters.
EXAMPLE 11.11 State variable feedback
Consider the open-loop control system shown in Figure 11.14. The state variables 
are identified as x t 1 ( ) and x t 2 ( ). The performance of this system is quite unsatisfac￾tory because an undamped response results for a step input. The vector differential

obtained by substituting k2 = 2 into Equation (11.50). Thus, we obtain

Because this is a second-order system, we note that the characteristic equation is

system in that the compensated system results in a minimum value for the per￾formance index when k1 = 1 is fixed. Of course, we recognize that this system 
is optimal only for the specific set of initial conditions that were assumed. The 
compensated system is shown in Figure 11.15. A curve of the performance index 
as a function of k2 is shown in Figure 11.16. It is clear that this system is not very 
sensitive to changes in k2 and will maintain a near-minimum performance index 
if the k2 is altered by some percentage. We define the sensitivity of an optimal

EXAMPLE 11.12 Determination of an optimal system
Now let us consider again the system of Example 11.11, where both the feed￾back gains, k1 and k2, are unspecified. To simplify the algebra without any loss 
in insight into the problem, let us set k k 1 2 = = k. We can prove that if k1 and 
k2 are unspecified, then k k 1 2 = when the minimum of the performance index 
(Equation 11.40) is obtained. Then, for the system of Example 11.11, Equation 
(11.45) becomes

The minimum value of J is obtained when k approaches infinity; the result is 
Jmin = 1. A plot of J versus k, shown in Figure 11.17, illustrates that the perfor￾mance index approaches a minimum asymptotically as k approaches an infinite 
value. Now, we recognize that, in providing a very large gain k, we can cause the 
feedback signal
u t( ) = −k x( ) 1 2 ( )t x + ( )t
to be very large. However, we are restricted to realizable magnitudes of the control 
signal u t( ). Therefore, we should introduce a constraint on u t( ) so that the gain k is 
not too large. Then, for example, if we establish a constraint on u t( ) so that
u t( ) ≤ 50, (11.60)
M11_DORF2374_14_GE_C11.indd 842 31/08/21 7:56 AMSection 11.7 Optimal Control Systems 843
we require that the maximum acceptable value of k in this case be

which is sufficiently close to the absolute minimum of J to satisfy our requirements.
Upon examining the performance index, we recognize that the reason the mag￾nitude of the control signal is not accounted for in the original calculations is that 
u t( ) is not included within the expression for the performance index. However, in 
many cases, we have physical limits on the control magnitude. To account for the 
control magnitude, we can consider the performance index
∫ = + ( ) ( ) λ ( ) ( ) ∞
J t x Ix u t t u t dt T T ( ) , 0
(11.63)
where λ is a scalar weighting factor and I = identity matrix. The weighting factor λ
will be chosen so that the relative importance of the state variable performance is 
contrasted with the importance of the control energy represented by t t Tu u ( ) ( ). We 
represent the state variable feedback via
u t( ) = −Kx( )t , (11.64)
and the system with this state variable feedback as

Then, in this case, we require that

and thus, as before, we have
J = x P ( ) x( ) T 0 0 . (11.69)
If λ = 0, Equation (11.68) reduces to Equation (11.41). Now, let us consider again 
Example 11.11 when λ is other than zero and account for the expenditure of control 
signal energy. ■

Therefore, the minimum of the performance index occurs when k k = = min 1 , λ
where kmin is the solution of Equation (11.73).
Let us complete this example for the case where the control energy and the 
state variables squared are equally important, so that λ = 1. Then Equation (11.73) 
is satisfied when k 1 0, 2 − = and we find that kmin = 1.0. The plot of J versus k for

this case is shown in Figure 11.18. The plot of J versus k for Example 11.12 is also 
shown for comparison in Figure 11.18. ■
The design of several parameters can be accomplished in a manner similar to 
that illustrated in the examples. Also, the design procedure can be carried out for 
higher-order systems. Consider the single-input, single-output system with
x A ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( )
and feedback
u t( ) = −Kx( )t k = −[ ] 1 2 k k … n x( )t .
We can consider the performance index

where R > 0 is a scalar weighting factor. This index is minimized when
K B R TP. = −1 (11.75)
The n n × matrix P is determined from the solution of the equation
A PT T PA PBR B P Q 0. + − −1 + = (11.76)
Equation (11.76) is often called the algebraic Riccati equation. This optimal control 
problem is called the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) [12, 19].
11.8 INTERNAL MODEL DESIGN
In this section, we consider the problem of designing a compensator that provides 
asymptotic tracking of a reference input with zero steady-state error. The refer￾ence inputs considered can include steps, ramps, and other persistent signals, such 
as sinusoids. For a step input, we know that zero steady-state tracking errors can 
be achieved with a type-one system. This idea is formalized here by introducing an 
internal model of the reference input in the compensator [5, 18].

x A ( )t t = + x B ( ) u t( ), . y t( ) = Cx( )t (11.77)
We consider a reference input to be generated by a linear system of the form
t t r t t x A r rx d r rxr  ( ) = = ( ), , ( ) ( ) (11.78)
with unknown initial conditions.
We begin by considering a familiar design problem, namely, the design of a 
controller to enable the tracking of a step reference input with zero steady-state 
error. In this case, the reference input is generated by
x t r t x t r r ( ) = = 0, ( ) ( ) (11.79)
or equivalently
r t ( ) = 0, (11.80)
and the tracking error e t( ) is defined as
e t( ) = − y t( ) r t( ).
Taking the time derivative yields
e t   ( ) = = y t( ) Cx( )t .
If we define the two intermediate variables
z x ( )t t = = ( ) and , w t( ) u t ( )
we have

If the system in Equation (11.81) is controllable, we can find a feedback of the form
w t( ) = −K e1 2 ( )t t − K z( ) (11.82)
such that Equation (11.81) is stable. This implies that the tracking error e is stable; 
thus, we will have achieved the objective of asymptotic tracking with zero steady￾state error. The control input, found by integrating Equation (11.82), is

A check of controllability shows that the system described by Equation (11.84) is 
completely controllable. We use
K1 2 = = 20, 2 K [ ] 0 10 ,
in order to locate the roots of the characteristic equation of Equation (11.84) at 
s j = −1 , ± − 10. With w t( ) given in Equation (11.82), Equation (11.84) is as￾ymptotically stable. So, for any initial tracking error e(0) we are guaranteed that 
e t( ) → 0 as t → ∞. ■
Consider a block diagram where the process is represented by G s( ) and the 
cascade controller is G s( ) = K s 1 . c The internal model principle states that if 
G s( )G s c ( ) contains R s( ), then y t( ) will track r t( ) asymptotically. In this case 
R s( ) = 1 , s which is contained in G s G s c ( ) ( ), as we expect.
Consider the problem of designing a controller to provide asymptotic tracking 
of a ramp input with zero steady-state error r t( ) = ≥ Mt,  t 0, where M is the ramp 
magnitude. In this case, the reference input model is

(11.87)
the system represented by Equation (11.86) is asymptotically stable; hence, the 
tracking error e t( ) → 0 as t → ∞, as desired. The control, u t( ), is found by integrat￾ing Equation (11.87) twice. In Figure 11.20, we see that the resulting controller has a 
double integrator, which is the internal model of the reference ramp input.
The internal model approach can be extended to other reference inputs by 
following the same general procedure outlined for the step and ramp inputs. In 
addition, the internal model design can be used to reject persistent disturbances by 
including models of the disturbances in the compensator.
11.9 DESIGN EXAMPLES
In this section we present a control system designed to manage the speed of the 
electric motor shaft of a diesel electric locomotive. The design process focuses on 
the design of a full-state feedback control system using pole-placement methods.
EXAMPLE 11.15 Diesel electric locomotive control
The diesel electric locomotive is depicted in Figure 11.21. The efficiency of the diesel 
engine is very sensitive to the speed of rotation of the motors. We want to design a 
control system that drives the electric motors of a diesel electric locomotive for use on 
railroad trains. The locomotive is driven by DC motors located on each of the axles. 
The throttle position is set by moving the input potentiometers. The elements of the 
design process emphasized in this example are highlighted in Figure 11.22.
The control objective is to regulate the shaft rotation speed ωo ( )t to the desired 
value t r ω ( ).
Control Goal
Regulate the shaft rotation speed to the desired value in the presence of 
external load torque disturbances.
The corresponding variable to be controlled is the shaft rotation speed ωo ( )t .

Variable to Be Controlled
Shaft rotation speed ωo ( )t .
The controlled speed ωo ( )t is sensed by a tachometer, which supplies a feedback 
voltage υo ( )t . The electronic amplifier amplifies the error signal, t t υ υ r o ( )− ( ),
between the reference and feedback voltage signals and provides a voltage t υf ( )
that is supplied to the field winding of a DC generator.
The generator is run at a constant speed ωd by the diesel engine and generates 
a voltage υg that is supplied to the armature of a DC motor. The motor is armature 
controlled, with a fixed current supplied to its field. As a result, the motor produces 
a torque T and drives the load connected to its shaft so that the controlled speed 
ωo ( )t tends to equal the command speed t r ω ( ).
A block diagram and signal flow graph of the system are shown in Figure 11.23. 
In Figure 11.23 we use Lt and Rt, which are defined as
L L t a = + Lg,
R R t a = + Rg.

Notice that the system has a feedback loop; we use the tachometer voltage υo ( )t
as a feedback signal to form an error signal t t υ υ r o ( )− ( ). Without additional state 
feedback, the only tuning parameter is the amplifier gain K. As a first step, we can 
investigate the system performance with tachometer voltage feedback only.
The key tuning parameters are given by

DS2 Percent overshoot of ωo ( )t of P.O. ≤ 10% to a unit step input ωr ( )s = 1 s.
DS3 Settling time of Ts ≤ 1 s to a unit step input.
The first step in the development of the vector differential equation that accurately 
describes the system is to choose a set of state variables. In practice the selection of 
state variables can be a difficult process, especially for complex systems. The state 
variables must be sufficient in number to determine the future behavior of the sys￾tem when the present state and all future inputs are known. The selection of state 
variables is related to the issue of complexity.
The diesel electric locomotive system has three major components: two elec￾trical circuits and one mechanical system. It seems logical that the state vector will 
include state variables from both electrical circuits and from the mechanical sys￾tem. One reasonable choice of state variables is x t 1 2 ( ) = = ωo a ( )t x ,   ( )t i ( )t , and 
x t i t f 3 ( ) = ( ). This state variable selection is not unique. With the state variables 
defined above, the state variable model is

Assume the tachometer feedback is available, that is, that Kt is in the loop. If we 
take advantage of the fact that
K K pot = =t 1,
then (from an input–output perspective) the system has the feedback configuration 
shown in Figure 11.24.

Using the Routh–Hurwitz method, we also find that the closed-loop system is 
stable for
− < 0.008 K < 0.0468.
The smallest steady-state tracking error is achieved for the largest value of K. At 
best we can obtain a 15% tracking error, which does not meet the design specifi￾cation DS1. Also, as K gets larger, the response becomes unacceptably oscillatory.
We now consider a full state feedback controller design. The feedback loops 
are shown in Figure 11.23, which shows that ω0 ( )t i ,   a ( )t , and i t f ( ) are available for 
feedback. Without any loss of generality, we set K = 1. Any value of K > 0 would 
work as well.

The control input is
u t K t K x t K x t K x t r t ( ) = − potω ( ) 1 2 ( )− − 2 3 ( ) 3 ( ).
The feedback gains to be determined are K K t ,   2, and K3. The tachometer gain, Kt , is now 
a key parameter of the design process. Also Kpot is a key variable for tuning. By adjusting the 
parameter Kpot, we have the freedom to scale the input t r ω ( ). When we define
K = [ ] K K t 2 3 K ,
then
u t t K t Kx r ( ) = − ( ) + potω ( ). (11.89)
The closed-loop system with state feedback is
x A ( )t t = − ( ) BK x B ( ) + υ( )t ,
y t( ) = Cx( )t ,  
where
t K t r υ ω ( ) = pot ( ).
We will use pole-placement methods to determine K such that the eigenvalues of 
A B − K are in the desired locations. First we make sure the system is controllable. 
When n = 3 the controllability matrix is

Since Kg ≠ 0 and Km ≠ 0 and 3 2 JLf Lt is nonzero, we determine that
de Pc t  ≠ 0.
Thus the system is controllable. We can place all the poles of the system appropri￾ately to satisfy DS2 and DS3.
The desired region to place the eigenvalues of A B − K is illustrated in 
Figure 11.25. The specific pole locations are selected to be
p1 = −50,  
p j 2 = −4 3 + ,  
p j 3 = −4 3 − .
Selecting p1 = −50 allows for a good second-order response governed by p2 and 
p3. The gain matrix K that achieves the desired closed-loop poles is
K = −[ ] 0.0041 0.0035 4.0333 .
To select the gain Kpot, we first compute the DC gain of the closed-loop transfer 
function. With the state feedback in place, the closed-loop transfer function is

Using the gain Kpot in this manner effectively scales the closed-loop transfer func￾tion so that the DC gain is equal to 1. We then expect that a unit step input repre￾senting a 1°/s step command results in a 1°/s steady-state output at ωo.
The step response of the system is shown in Figure 11.26. We can see that all the 
design specifications are satisfied. ■

11.10 STATE VARIABLE DESIGN USING CONTROL DESIGN SOFTWARE
Controllability and observability of a system in state variable feedback form can 
be checked using the functions ctrb and obsv, respectively. The inputs to the ctrb 
function, shown in Figure 11.27, are the system matrix A and the input matrix B; 
the output of ctrb is the controllability matrix Pc . Similarly, the input to the obsv 
function, shown in Figure 11.27, is the system matrix A and the output matrix C; the 
output of obsv is the observability matrix Po.
Notice that the controllability matrix Pc is a function only of A and B, while the 
observability matrix Po is a function only of A and C.

where the state vector x( )t represents normalized perturbations from the circular, 
equatorial orbit; u t r ( ) is the input from a radial thruster; u t t( ) is the input from a 
tangential thruster; and ω = 0.0011 rad/s (approximately one orbit of 90 minutes) is 
the orbital rate for the satellite at the specific altitude. In the absence of perturba￾tions, the satellite will remain in the nominal circular equatorial orbit. However, dis￾turbances such as aerodynamic drag can cause the satellite to deviate from its nominal 
path. The problem is to design a controller that commands the satellite thrusters in

such a manner that the actual orbit remains near the desired circular orbit. Before 
commencing with the design, we check controllability. In this case, we investigate 
controllability using the radial and tangential thrusters independently.
Suppose the tangential thruster fails (i.e., u t t( ) = 0), and only the radial thruster 
is operational. Is the satellite controllable from u t r ( ) only? We answer this question 
by using an m-file script to determine the controllability. Using the script shown in 
Figure 11.29, we find that the determinant Pc is zero; thus, the satellite is not com￾pletely controllable when the tangential thruster fails.
Suppose now that the radial thruster fails (i.e., u t r ( ) = 0) and that the tangen￾tial thruster is functioning properly. Is the satellite controllable from ut only? Using 
the script in Figure 11.30, we find that the satellite is completely controllable using 
the tangential thruster only. ■
We conclude this section with a controller design for a third-order system using 
state variable models. The design approach utilizes root locus methods and incorpo￾rates m-file scripts to assist in the procedure.

Our design specifications are a step response with (1) a settling time (with a 2% 
criterion) of Ts … 2 s and (2) a percent overshoot of P.O. … 4%. We assume that the 
state variables are available for feedback, so that the control is given by

The roots for the selected gain, KK3 = 12, lie in the performance region, as shown

the selected point. The final gains are K K = = 240.00,   1 2 1.00,   K = 0.35, and 
K3 = 0.05. The controller design results in a settling time of about 1.8 seconds and 
an overshoot of 3%, as shown in Figure 11.32. ■
In Section 11.4, we discussed Ackermann’s formula to place the poles of the 
system at desired locations. The function acker calculates the gain matrix K to place 
the closed-loop poles at the desired locations. The acker function is illustrated in 
Figure 11.33.

11.11 SEQUENTIAL DESIGN EXAMPLE: DISK DRIVE READ SYSTEM
In this chapter, we will design a state variable feedback system that will achieve the 
desired system response. The specifications for the system are given in Table 11.2. 
The second-order open-loop model is shown in Figure 11.35. We will design the 
system for this second-order model and then test the system response for both the 
second-order and third-order models.
First, we select the two state variables as x t 1 ( ) = y t( ) and x t 2 1 ( ) = = dy( )t dt dx t( ) dt,
x t 2 1 ( ) = = dy( )t dt dx t( ) dt, as shown in Figure 11.36. It is practical to measure these variables as the 
position and velocity of the reader head. We then add the state variable feedback, 
as shown in Figure 11.36. We choose K1 = 1, since our goal is for y t( ) to closely and 
accurately follow the command r t( ). The state variable differential equation for the 
open-loop system is

The characteristic equation of the closed-loop system is

since K1 = 1. In order to achieve the specifications, we select ζ = 0.90 and 
ζωn = 125. Then the desired closed-loop characteristic equation is
2 250 19290 0. 2 2 2 s s + + ζωn n ω = + s s + =
Therefore, we require that 5Ka = 19290 or Ka = 3858. Furthermore, we require that
20 + = 5K K2 a 250,
or K2 = 0.012.
The system with the second-order model has the desired response and meets all 
the specifications, as shown in Table 11.2. If we add the field inductance L = 1 mH,

Using this model, which incorporates the field inductance, we test the response of 
the system with the feedback gains selected for the second-order model. The results are 
provided in Table 11.2, illustrating that the second-order model is a very good model of 
the system. The actual results of the third-order system meet the specifications.
11.12 SUMMARY
In this chapter, the design of control systems in the time domain was examined. 
The three-step design procedure for constructing state variable compensators was 
presented. The optimal design of a system using state variable feedback and an inte￾gral performance index was considered. Also, the s-plane design of systems utilizing 
state variable feedback was examined. Finally, internal model design was discussed.

P11.1 A first-order system is represented by the time-do￾main differential equation
x t ( ) = + x t( ) u t( ).
A feedback controller is to be designed such that
u t( ) = −2 , kx( )t

t → ∞. The performance integral is defined as

and the initial value of the state variable is x( ) 0 3 = .
Obtain the value of k in order to make J a minimum. 
Is this k physically realizable? Select a practical value 
for the gain k, and evaluate the performance index 
with that gain. Is the system stable without the feed￾back due to u t( )?
P11.2 To account for the expenditure of energy and re￾sources, the control signal is often included in the per￾formance integral. Then the operation will not involve 
an unlimited control signal u(t). One suitable perfor￾mance index, which includes the effect of the magni￾tude of the control signal, is

DP11.4 A high-performance helicopter has a model

Find (a) a state variable representation of this 
system and (b) the transfer function representation for 
θ δ ( )s s( ). (c) Use state variable feedback to achieve 
adequate performances for the controlled system.
Desired specifications include (1) a steady-state 
for an input step command for s dθ ( ), the desired 
pitch angle, less than 20% of the input step magni￾tude; (2) an overshoot for a step input command less

DP11.5 The headbox process is used in the manufac￾ture of paper to transform the pulp slurry flow into 
a jet of 2 cm and then spread it onto a mesh belt [22]. 
To achieve desirable paper quality, the pulp slurry 
must be distributed as evenly as possible on the belt, 
and the relationship between the velocity of the jet 
and that of the belt, called the jet/belt ratio, must 
be maintained. One of the main control variables is 
the  pressure in the headbox, which in turn controls 
the velocity of the slurry at the jet. The total pressure 
in the headbox is the sum of the liquid-level pressure 
and the air pressure that is pumped into the headbox. 
Because the pressurized headbox is a highly dynamic 
and coupled system, manual control would be diffi￾cult to maintain and could result in degradation in 
the sheet properties.
The state-space model of a typical headbox, lin￾earized about a particular stationary point, is given

DP11.6 A coupled-drive apparatus is shown in Figure 
DP11.6. The coupled drives consist of two pulleys 
connected via an elastic belt, which is tensioned by a 
third pulley mounted on springs providing an under￾damped dynamic mode. One of the main pulleys, pul￾ley A, is driven by an electric DC motor. Both pulleys 
A and B are fitted with tachometers that generate 
measurable voltages proportional to the rate of ro￾tation of the pulley. When a voltage is applied to the 
DC motor, pulley A will accelerate at a rate governed 
by the total inertia experienced by the system. Pulley 
B, at the other end of the elastic belt, will also accel￾erate owing to the applied voltage or torque, but with 
a lagging effect caused by the elasticity of the belt. 
Integration of the velocity signals measured at each 
pulley will provide an angular position estimate for the 
pulley [23].

PREVIEW
Physical systems and the external environment in which they operate cannot be 
modeled precisely, may change in an unpredictable manner, and may be subject to 
significant disturbances. The design of control systems in the presence of signifi￾cant uncertainty motivates the concept of robust control system design. Advances 
in robust control design methodologies can address stability robustness and per￾formance robustness in the presence of uncertainty. In this chapter, we describe 
five methods for robust design, including root locus, frequency response, ITAE 
methods for a robust PID systems, internal model control, and pseudo-quantita￾tive feedback methods. However, we should also realize that classical design tech￾niques may also produce robust control systems. Control engineers who are aware 
of these issues can design robust PID controllers, robust lead-lag controllers, and 
so forth. The chapter concludes with a PID controller design for the Sequential 
Design Example: Disk Drive Read System.
DESIRED OUTCOMES
Upon completion of Chapter 12, students should be able to:
❏ Describe the role of robustness in control system design.
❏ Identify uncertainty models, including additive uncertainty, multiplicative uncertainty, 
and parameter uncertainty.
❏ Explain the various methods of tackling the robust control design problem using root 
locus, frequency response, ITAE methods for PID control, internal model, and pseudo￾quantitative feedback methods.

12.1 INTRODUCTION
A control system designed using the methods and concepts of the preceding chap￾ters assumes knowledge of the model of the process and controller and constant 
parameters. The process model will be an inaccurate representation of the actual 
physical system due to
❍ parameter changes
❍ unmodeled dynamics
❍ unmodeled time delays
❍ changes in equilibrium point (operating point)
❍ sensor noise
❍ unpredicted disturbance inputs.
The goal of robust control system design is to maintain acceptable closed-loop sys￾tem performance in the presence of model inaccuracies and changes.

unmodeled dynamics and parameter changes may be significant, and for these sys￾tems the challenge is to create a design that retains the desired performance.
12.2 ROBUST CONTROL SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM SENSITIVITY
Designing highly accurate systems in the presence of significant plant uncertainty 
is a classical feedback design problem. The theoretical bases for the solution of this 
problem date back to the works of H. S. Black and H. W. Bode in the early 1930s, 
when this problem was referred to as the sensitivities design problem. A significant 
amount of literature has been published since then regarding the design of systems 
subject to large process uncertainty. The designer seeks to obtain a system that per￾forms adequately over a large range of uncertain parameters. A system is said to be 
robust when it is durable, hardy, and resilient.
A control system is robust when (1) it has low sensitivities, (2) it is stable over 
the expected range of parameter variations, and (3) the performance continues to 
meet the specifications in the presence of a set of changes in the system parameters 
[3, 4]. Robustness is the low sensitivity to effects that are not considered in the anal￾ysis and design phase—for example, disturbances, measurement noise, and unmod￾eled dynamics. The system should be able to withstand these neglected effects when 
performing the tasks for which it was designed.
For small-parameter perturbations, we may use, as a measure of robustness, the 
differential sensitivities discussed in Sections 4.3 (system sensitivity) and Section 7.5 
(root sensitivity) [6]. The system sensitivity is defined as
, α α = ∂
∂
Sα
T T T (12.1)
where α is the parameter and T the transfer function. The root sensitivity is defined as
Sr ri i . α α = ∂
∂ α (12.2)
When the zeros of T s( ) are independent of the parameter α, we showed that

for an nth-order system. For example, if we have a closed-loop system, as shown 
in Figure 12.2, where the variable parameter is α, then T s( ) = + 1 1 [ ] s ( ) α + , and

Of course, the sensitivity S s( ) only represents robustness for small changes in 
gain. If K changes from K = 1 4 within the range K = 1 16 to K = 1, the resulting 
range of step response is shown in Figure 12.5. This system, with an expected wide

selected input.
EXAMPLE 12.1 Sensitivity of a controlled system
Consider the system shown in Figure 12.6, where G s( ) = 1 s2 and a PD controller 
G s c p ( ) = + K KDs. Then the sensitivity with respect to changes in G s( ) is

Consider the nominal condition ζ = 1 and ωn p = K . Then, KD n = 2ω to achieve 
ζ = 1. Therefore, we may plot 20 log S and 20 log T on a Bode plot, as shown in 
Figure 12.7. Note that the frequency ωn is an indicator on the boundary between 
the frequency region in which the sensitivity is the important design criterion and 
the region in which the stability margin is important. Thus, if we specify ωn prop￾erly to take into consideration the extent of modeling error and the frequency of 
external disturbance, we can expect the system to have an acceptable amount of 
robustness. ■

12.3 ANALYSIS OF ROBUSTNESS
System goals include maintaining a small tracking error for an input R s( ) and 
keeping the output Y s( ) small for a disturbance T s d ( ). The sensitivity function is
( ) ( ) ( ) = +
S s
G s c G s
1
1 ,
and the complementary sensitivity function is
( ) ( ) ( )
( ) ( ) = +
C s G s G s
G s G s
c
1 c
.
We also have the relationship
S s( ) + = C s( ) 1. (12.13)
For physically realizable systems, the loop gain L s( ) = G s c ( )G s( ) is small for high 
frequencies. This means that S j ( ) ω approaches 1 at high frequencies.
Consider the closed-loop system shown in Figure 12.1. An additive perturbation
characterizes the set of possible processes as follows:
G s a ( ) = + G s( ) A s( ),
where G s( ) is the nominal process, and A s( ) is the perturbation that is bounded in 
magnitude. We assume that G s a ( ) and G s( ) have the same number of poles in the 
right-hand s-plane (if any) [32]. Then the system stability will not change if
A j G j G j ( ) ω ω < +1 f c ( ) ( ) ω ω or all  . (12.14)
This assures stability but not dynamic performance.
A multiplicative perturbation is modeled as
G s m ( ) = + G s( )[ ] 1 . M s( )
The perturbation is bounded in magnitude, and it is again assumed that G s m ( ) and 
G s( ) have the same number of poles in the right-hand s-plane. Then the system 
stability will not change if
1 1 M j for all  . G j G j c
ω
ω ω ( ) ω ( ) ( ) < + (12.15)
Equation (12.15) is called the robust stability criterion. This is a test for robust￾ness with respect to a multiplicative perturbation. This form of perturbation is often 
M12_DORF2374_14_GE_C12.indd 888 15/09/21 9:46 AMSection 12.3 Analysis of Robustness 889
used because it satisfies the intuitive properties of (1) being small at low frequen￾cies, where the nominal process model is usually well known, and (2) being large at 
high frequencies, where the nominal model is always inexact.
EXAMPLE 12.3 System with multiplicative perturbation
Consider the system of Figure 12.1 with G K c = , and
( ) ( ) ( )
( ) = +
+ + +
G s s
s s s s
170000 0.1
3 10 10000 . 2
The system is unstable with K = 1, but a reduction in gain to K = 0.5 will stabilize 
it. Now, consider the effect of an unmodeled pole at 50 rad/s. In this case, the multi￾plicative perturbation is determined from
+ = ( ) +
M s
s
1 50
50 ,
or M s( ) = −s s( ) + 50 . The magnitude bound is then
ω
ω
ω ( ) = −
+ 50 M j . j
j
M j ( ) ω and 1 1 + ( ) KG( ) jω are shown in Figure 12.10(a), where it is seen that the 
criterion of Equation (12.15) is not satisfied. Thus, the system may not be stable.
If we use a lag compensator
( ) ( ) = +
+
G s s
s c
0.15 25
2.5 ,
the loop transfer function is L s( ) = +1 . G s c ( )G s( ) We reshape the function 
G j c ( ) ω ω G j ( ) in the frequency range 2 2 < < ω 5 and check the condition
ω
ω ω ( ) ( ) ( ) < +1 1 M j , G j G j c
as shown in Figure 12.10(b). Here the robustness inequality is satisfied, and the 
system is robustly stable. ■
The control objective is to design a compensator G s c ( ) so that the transient, 
steady-state, and frequency-domain specifications are achieved and the cost of 
feedback measured by the bandwidth of the compensator G j c ( ) ω is sufficiently 
small. This bandwidth constraint is needed mainly because of measurement noise. 
In subsequent sections, we discuss including a pre-filter in a two-degree-of-freedom 
configuration to help achieve the design goals.

12.4 SYSTEMS WITH UNCERTAIN PARAMETERS
Many systems have several parameters that are constants but uncertain within a 
range. For example, consider a system with a characteristic equation
s a n + + n−1s a n−1 n−2s a n−2 + +    0 0 = (12.16)
with known coefficients within bounds
α β i i ≤ ≤ a n i  and i 0 = …,   ,   ,
where an = 1.
To ascertain the stability of the system, we might have to investigate all possi￾ble combinations of parameters. Fortunately, it is possible to investigate a limited 
number of worst-case polynomials [20]. The analysis of only four polynomials is

q s 3 ( ) = + s s β β + +s α ,   3 2 2 1 0
q s 4 ( ) = + s s α α + +s β . 3 2 2 1 0
One of the four polynomials represents the worst case and may indicate either 
unstable performance or at least the worst performance for the system in that case.
EXAMPLE 12.4 Third-order system with uncertain parameters
Consider a third-order system with uncertain coefficients such that
8 6 ≤ ≤ a0 0 0 8 ⇒ = α β,   0 = 60;  
12 ≤ ≤ a1 1 100 ⇒ = α β 12,   1 = 100;  
7 2 ≤ ≤ a2 2 5 7 ⇒ = α β,   2 = 25.
The four polynomials are

q s 3 ( ) = + s s 25 + + 100s 8, 3 2
q s 4 ( ) = + s s 7 1 + + 2s 60. 3 2
We then proceed to check these four polynomials by means of the Routh–Hurwitz 
criterion, and determine that the system is stable for all the range of uncertain 
parameters. ■

that this system is nominally stable. However, if the system has uncertain coeffi￾cients such that

M12_DORF2374_14_GE_C12.indd 891 15/09/21 9:46 AM892 Chapter 12 Robust Control Systems
then we must examine the four polynomials:

q s 2 ( ) = + s s 4 1 + +s 4, 3 2
q s 3 ( ) = + s s 4 3 + +s 4, 3 2
q s 4 ( ) = + s s 2 1 + +s 5. 3 2
Using the Routh–Hurwitz criterion, q s 1 ( ) and q s 3 ( ) are stable and q s 2 ( ) is margin￾ally stable. For q s 4 ( ), we have

Note that the third pole has moved toward the jω-axis to its limit at s = −1 and 
that the gain has increased to its limit at K = 5. ■
12.5 THE DESIGN OF ROBUST CONTROL SYSTEMS
The design of robust control systems involves determining the structure of the con￾troller and adjusting the controller parameters to achieve acceptable performance 
in the presence of uncertainty. The structure of the controller is chosen such that 
the system response can meet certain performance criteria.
One possible objective in the design of a control system is that the controlled 
system output should very accurately track the input. That is, we want to minimize 
the tracking error. In an ideal setting, the Bode plot of the loop gain, L s( ), would 
be 0-dB gain of infinite bandwidth and zero phase shift. In practice, this is not pos￾sible. One possible design objective is to maintain the magnitude response curve as 
flat and as close to unity for as large a bandwidth as possible for a given plant and 
controller combination [20].
Another important goal of a control system design is that the effect on the 
output of the system due to disturbances is minimized. Consider the control sys￾tem shown in Figure 12.11, where G s( ) is the plant and T s d ( ) is the disturbance. 
We then have

Note that both the reference and disturbance transfer functions have the same 
denominator; in other words, they have the same characteristic equation—namely,
1 1 + = G s c ( )G s( ) + = L s( ) 0. (12.20)
Recall that the sensitivity of T s( ) with respect to G s( ) is
1
1
S . G s G s G
T
c ( ) ( ) = + (12.21)
Equation (12.21) shows that for low sensitivity, we desire a high value of loop gain 
L j ( ) ω . But it is known that a high gain can lead to instability and amplification of 
the measurement noise. Thus, we seek the following:
1. T s( ) with wide bandwidth.
2. Large loop gain L s( ) at low frequencies.
3. Small loop gain L s( ) at high frequencies.
Setting the design of robust systems in frequency-domain terms, we scale a 
compensator G s c ( ) such that the closed-loop sensitivity is less than some tolerance 
value. But sensitivity minimization involves finding a compensator such that the 
closed-loop sensitivity is minimized.
The gain and phase margin problem is to find a compensator to achieve prescribed 
gain and phase margins. The disturbance rejection problem and measurement noise 
attenuation problem seeks a solution with high loop gain at low frequencies and 
low loop gain at high frequencies, respectively. For the frequency-domain specifica￾tions, we seek the following conditions for the Bode plot of G j c ( ) ω ω G j ( ), shown in 
Figure 12.12:
1. For relative stability, the loop gain must have not more than a −20-dB decade slope 
at or near the crossover frequency ωc.
2. Steady-state accuracy and measurement noise rejection achieved by the low gain at 
high frequency.
3. Disturbance rejection by a high gain over low frequencies.
4. Accuracy over a bandwidth ωB, by maintaining the loop gain above a prescribed 
level.

Using the root sensitivity concept, we can state that Sa
r must be minimized while 
attaining T s( ) with dominant roots that will provide the appropriate response and 
minimize the effect of T s d ( ). As an example, let G s c ( ) = K and G s( ) = + 1 / ( ) s s( )1
for the system in Figure 12.11. This system has two roots, and we select a gain K so 
that Y s( ) / T s d ( ) is minimized, SK
r is minimized, and T s( ) has desirable dominant 
roots. The sensitivity is

The magnitude of the root sensitivity is shown in Figure 12.13 for K = 0.2 to

select K ≈ 1.25 yields a near minimum sensitivity while maintaining good perfor￾mance for the step response. To reduce the root sensitivity while simultaneously 
minimizing the effect of disturbances, we can use the design procedure as follows:
1. Sketch the root locus of the compensated system with G s c ( ) chosen to attain the 
desired location for the dominant roots.
2. Maximize the gain of G s c ( ) to reduce the effect of the disturbance.
3. Determine SK
r and attain the minimum value of the root sensitivity consistent with the 
transient response required, as described in Step 1.

12.6 THE DESIGN OF ROBUST PID-CONTROLLED SYSTEMS
The PID controller has the transfer function
G s K K
s
c P K s I ( ) = + + D .
The popularity of PID controllers can be attributed partly to their robust perfor￾mance over a wide range of operating conditions and partly to their functional sim￾plicity, which allows engineers to operate them in a straightforward manner. To 
implement the PID controller, three parameters must be determined for the given 
process: proportional gain, integral gain, and derivative gain [31].
Consider the PID controller

where a K = P D K and b K = I D K Therefore, a PID controller introduces a trans￾fer function with one pole at the origin and two zeros.
Recall that a root locus begins at the poles and ends at the zeros. If we have a 
system as shown in Figure 12.16 with
( ) ( )( ) = + +
G s

2 5 ,
and we use a PID controller with complex zeros, we can plot the root locus as shown 
in Figure 12.17. As the gain KD of the controller is increased, the complex roots 
approach the zeros. The closed-loop transfer function is

when KD  1. The only limiting factor is the allowable magnitude of U s( )
(Figure 12.16) when KD is large. If KD is 100, the system has a fast response 
and zero steady-state error. Furthermore, the effect of the disturbance is reduced 
significantly.
In general, we note that PID controllers are particularly useful for reducing 
steady-state error and improving the transient response when G s( ) has one or two 
poles (or may be approximated by a second-order process).
The main problem in the selection of the three PID controller parameters is 
that these coefficients do not readily translate into the desired performance and ro￾bustness characteristics that the control system designer has in mind. Several rules 
and methods have been proposed to solve this problem. In this section, we consider 
several design methods using root locus and performance indices.
The first design method uses the ITAE performance index. Hence, we select the 
three PID coefficients to minimize the ITAE performance index, which produces

an excellent transient response to a step or a ramp. The design procedure consists 
of three steps:
1. Select the ωn of the closed-loop system by specifying the settling time.
2. Determine the three coefficients using the appropriate optimum equation (Table 5.3 
and Table 5.4) and the ωn of step 1 to obtain G s c ( ).
3. Determine a prefilter G s p ( ) so that the closed-loop system transfer function, T s( ), 
does not have any zeros.

We need to select ωn in order to meet the settling time requirement. Since 
Ts n = 4 ( ) ζω and ζ is unknown but near 0.8, we set ωn = 10. Then, equating the 
denominator of Equation (12.34) to Equation (12.35), we obtain the three coeffi￾cients as K K P D = = 214,   15.5, and KI = 1000.

in order to eliminate the zeros in Equation (12.36) and bring the overall numerator

The system has a small percent overshoot, a settling time of Ts … 0.5 s, and zero 
steady-state error. Furthermore, for a disturbance T s d ( ) = 1 , s the maximum value 
of y t( ) due to the disturbance is 0.4% of the magnitude of the disturbance. This is a 
very favorable design.
Let us consider the system when the plant varies significantly, so that
τ
( ) ( ) = +
G s K
s 1 , 2 (12.39)
where 0.5 ≤ ≤τ 1 and 1 2 ≤ ≤ K . We want to investigate the behavior using the 
ITAE optimum system with the prefilter. The objective is to have an overshoot of 
P.O. … 4% and a settling time (with a 2% criterion) of Ts … 2 s while G s( ) can attain 
any value in the range indicated.
We then obtain the step response for the four conditions: τ τ = = 1,   1 K K ;   = = 0.5, 1;  τ = = 1,  2 K ;
τ τ = = 1,   1 K K ;   = = 0.5, 1;  τ = = 1,   2 K ; and τ = = 0.5,  K 2. The results are summarized in 
Figure 12.18. This is a very robust system. ■
The value of ωn that can be chosen will be limited by considering the maxi￾mum allowable u t( ), where u t( ) is the output of the controller, as shown in Figure 
12.16. As an example, consider the system in Figure 12.16 with a PID controller, 
G s( ) = + 1 1 ( ) s s( ) , and the necessary prefilter G s p( ) to achieve ITAE perfor￾mance. If we select ωn = 10,  20, and 40, the maximum value of u t( ) is as recorded 
in Table 12.3. If we wish to limit u t( ), we need to limit ωn. Thus, we are limited in 
the settling time we can achieve.
12.7 THE ROBUST INTERNAL MODEL CONTROL SYSTEM
The internal model control system is shown in Figure 12.19. We now consider the 
use of the internal model design with special attention to robust system perfor￾mance. The internal model principle states that if G s c ( )G s( ) contains R s( ) then 
Y s( ) will track R s( ) asymptotically (in the steady state), and the tracking is robust.

We select ωn to satisfy a specification for the settling time. For a settling time (with a 
2% criterion) of Ts = 1 s, we select ωn = 5. Then we require Kp = 16 and KI = 25.
The response of this system settles in Ts = 1 s and then tracks the ramp with zero 
steady-state error. If this system (designed for a ramp input) receives a step input, the 
response has a percent overshoot of P.O. = 5% and a settling time of Ts = 1.5 s. This 
system is very robust to changes in the plant. For example, if G s( ) = K s changes gain 
so that K varies by ±50%, the change in the ramp response is insignificant.
EXAMPLE 12.8 Design of an internal model control system
Consider the system of Figure 12.20 with state variable feedback and a compensator 
G s c ( ). We wish to track a step input with zero steady-state error. Here, we select a 
PID controller for G s c ( ). We then have
G s K s K s K
s c D P I , 2
( ) = + +
and G s( )G s c ( ) will contain R s( ) = 1 , s the input command. Note that we feed back 
both state variables and add these additional signals after G s c ( ) in order to retain 
the integrator in G s c ( ).
The goal is to achieve a settling time (to within 2% of the final value) of Ts … 1 
second and a deadbeat response while retaining a robust response. Here, we assume 
that the two poles of G s( ) can change by ±50%. Then the worst-case condition is
( ) ( )( ) = + +
G s
s s
ˆ 1
0.5 1 .
One design approach is to design the control for this worst-case condition. Another 
approach, which we use here, is to design for the nominal G s( ) and one-half the de￾sired settling time. Then we expect to meet the settling time requirement and attain 
a very fast, highly robust system. Note that the prefilter G s p ( ) is used to attain the 
desired form for T s( ).

We let K K a b 10 K K P I = = ,   2, = = 127.6,   527.5, and KD = 10.35. Note that T s( )
could be achieved with other gain combinations.
The step response of this system has a deadbeat response with a percent over￾shoot of P.O. = 1.65% and a settling time of Ts = 0.5 s. When the poles of G s( )
change by ±50%, the percent overshoot changes to P.O. = 1.86%, and the settling 
time is Ts = 0.95 s. This is an outstanding design of a robust deadbeat response 
system. ■
12.8 DESIGN EXAMPLES
In this section we present two illustrative examples. The first example illustrates 
the design of two degree-of-freedom controllers (that is, two separate controllers) 
for an ultra-precision diamond turning machine. In the second design example, we 
consider the practical problem of designing a controller in the presence of an un￾certain time delay. The specific problem under investigation is a PID controller for 
a digital audio tape drive. The design process is highlighted with an emphasis on 
robustness.
EXAMPLE 12.9 Ultra-precision diamond turning machine
The design of an ultra-precision diamond turning machine has been studied at 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. This machine shapes optical devices 
such as mirrors with ultra-high precision using a diamond tool as the cutting 
device. In this discussion, we will consider only the z-axis control. Using fre￾quency response identification with sinusoidal input to the actuator we deter￾mined that
( ) = +
G s
s
4500
60 . (12.45)
The system can accommodate high gains, since the input command is a series of 
step commands of very small magnitude (a fraction of a micron). The system has 
an outer loop for position feedback using a laser interferometer with an accuracy of 
0.1 micron − (10 m). 7 An inner feedback loop is also used for velocity feedback, as 
shown in Figure 12.21.
M12_DORF2374_14_GE_C12.indd 903 15/09/21 9:46 AM904 Chapter 12 Robust Control Systems
We want to select the controllers, G s 1 ( ) and G s 2 ( ), to obtain an overdamped, 
highly robust, high-bandwidth system. The robust system must accommodate 
changes in G s( ) due to varying loads, materials, and cutting requirements. Thus, we 
seek a large phase margin and gain margin for the inner and outer loops, and low 
root sensitivity. The specifications are summarized in Table 12.4.
Since we want zero steady-state error for the velocity loop, we propose a veloc￾ity loop controller G s 2 3 ( ) = G s( )G s 4 ( ), where G s 3 ( ) is a PI controller and G s 4 ( ) is 
a phase-lead compensator. Thus, we have

in Figure 12.23(b). We select KP = 1000 and achieve the actual results for the total 
system transfer function as recorded in Table 12.5. The total system has a high phase 
margin, has a low sensitivity, and is overdamped with a large bandwidth. This system 
is very robust. ■

If we define

then we have

In the development of a robust stability controller, we would like to represent 
the time-delay uncertainty in the form shown in Figure 12.25 where we need to de￾termine a function M s( ) that approximately models the time delay. This will lead 
to the establishment of a straightforward method of testing the system for stability 
robustness in the presence of the uncertain time-delay. The uncertainty model is 
known as a multiplicative uncertainty representation.
Since we are concerned with stability, we can consider R s( ) = 0. Then we can ma￾nipulate the block diagram in Figure 12.25 to obtain the form shown in Figure 12.26. 
Using the small gain theorem, we have the condition that the closed-loop system is 
stable if

The challenge is that the time delay T is not known exactly. One approach to 
solving the problem is to find a weighting function, denoted by W s( ), such that
e W −j Tω − < 1 f ( ) j T ω ω or all   and T . 1 2 ≤ ≤ T (12.48)
If W s( ) satisfies the inequality in Equation (12.48), it follows that
M j ( ) ω ω < W j ( ) .
Therefore, the robust stability condition can be satisfied by
W j G j G j c
1 1
ω for all  . ω ω ( ) ω ( ) ( ) < + (12.49)
This is a conservative bound. If the condition in Equation (12.49) is satisfied, then sta￾bility is guaranteed in the presence of any time delay in the range T T 1 2 ≤ ≤ T [5, 32]. 
If the condition is not satisfied, the system may or may not be stable.
Suppose we have an uncertain time delay that is known to lie in the range 
0.1 ≤ ≤ T 1. We can determine a suitable weighting function W s( ) by plotting 
the magnitude of e−j Tω − 1, as shown in Figure 12.27 for various values of 
T in the range T T 1 2 ≤ ≤ T . A reasonable weighting function obtained by trial 
and error is

Keep in mind that the selection of the weighting function is not unique.
A digital audio tape (DAT) stores 1.3 gigabytes of data in a package the size 
of a credit card—roughly nine times more than a half-inch-wide reel-to-reel tape 
or quarter-inch-wide cartridge tape. A DAT sells for about the same amount 
as a floppy disk, even though it can store 1000 times more data. A DAT can 
record for two hours (longer than either reel-to-reel or cartridge tape), which 
means that it can run longer unattended and requires fewer changes and hence 
fewer interruptions of data transfer. DAT gives access to a given data file within 
20 seconds, on the average, compared with several minutes for either cartridge or 
reel-to-reel tape [2].
The tape drive electronically controls the relative speeds of the drum and tape 
so that the heads follow the tracks on the tape, as shown in Figure 12.28. The con￾trol system is complex because motors have to be accurately controlled: capstan, 
take-up and supply reels, drum, and tension control. The elements of the design 
process emphasized in this example are highlighted in Figure 12.29.
Consider the speed control system shown in Figure 12.30. The motor and load 
transfer function varies because the tape moves from one reel to the other. The 
transfer function is

to a family of processes, where each member corresponds to different values of 
K p m,   1, and p2. The design goal is

K p m,   1, and p2. None of the responses suggests a percent overshoot over the spec￾ified value of P.O. = 13%, and the settling times are all under the Ts ≤ 2 s spec￾ification as well. As we can see in Figure 12.33, all of the tested processes in the 
family are adequately controlled by the single PID controller in Equation (12.52). 
Therefore DS1 is satisfied for all processes in the family.
Suppose the system has a time delay at the input to the process. The actual 
time delay is uncertain but known to be in the range 0 ≤ ≤ T 0.1 s. Following the 
method discussed previously, we determine that a reasonable function W s( ) which 
bounds the plots of e−j Tω − 1 for various values of T is

12.9 THE PSEUDO-QUANTITATIVE FEEDBACK SYSTEM
Quantitative feedback theory (QFT) uses a controller, as shown in Figure 12.35, to 
achieve robust performance. The goal is to achieve a wide bandwidth for the closed￾loop transfer function with a high loop gain K. Typical QFT design methods use 
graphical and numerical methods in conjunction with the Nichols chart. Generally, 
QFT design seeks a high loop gain and large phase margin so that robust perfor￾mance is achieved [24–26, 28].
In this section, we pursue a simple method of achieving the goals of QFT with 
an s-plane, root locus approach to the selection of the gain K and the compensator
G s c( ). This approach, dubbed pseudo-QFT, follows these steps:
1. Place the n poles and m zeros of G s( ) on the s-plane for the nth order G s( ). Also, add 
any poles of G s c( ).
2. Starting near the origin, place the zeros of G s c( ) immediately to the left of each of the 
( ) n − 1 poles on the left-hand s-plane. This leaves one pole far to the left of the left￾hand side of the s-plane.
3. Increase the gain K so that the roots of the characteristic equation (poles of the closed￾loop transfer function) are close to the zeros of G s c( )G s( ).
This method introduces zeros so that all but one of the root loci end on fi￾nite zeros. If the gain K is sufficiently large, then the poles of T s( ) are almost 
equal to the zeros of G s c( )G s( ). This leaves one pole of T s( ) with a significant 
partial fraction residue and the system with a phase margin of approximately 90° 
(actually about 85°).

Consider the system of Figure 12.35 with
( )( ) ( ) = + +
G s
s p s p
1 , 1 2
where the nominal case is p1 = 1 and p2 = 2, with ±50% variation. The worst case 
is with p1 = 0.5 and p2 = 1. We wish to design the system for zero steady-state 
error for a step input, so we use the PID controller
G s s z s z
s c( ) ( )( ) = + + . 1 2
We then invoke the internal model principle, with R s( ) = 1 s incorporated within
G s c ( )G s( ). Using Step 1, we place the poles of on the s-plane, as shown in Figure 
12.36. There are three poles (at s = − 0,   1, and −2), as shown. Step 2 calls for plac￾ing a zero to the left of the pole at the origin and at the pole at s = −1, as shown in 
Figure 12.36.
The compensator is thus

zeros. The closed-loop transfer function is

This closed-loop system provides a fast response and possesses a phase margin 
of P.M. = 85°. When the worst-case conditions are realized (p1 = 0.5 and p2 = 1), 
the performance remains essentially unchanged. Pseudo-QFT design results in very 
robust systems. ■
12.10 ROBUST CONTROL SYSTEMS USING CONTROL DESIGN SOFTWARE
In this section, we investigate robust control systems using control design software. 
In particular, we will consider the commonly used PID controller in the feedback 
control system shown in Figure 12.16. Note that the system has a prefilter G s p ( ).
The objective is to choose the PID parameters KP, KI, and KD to meet 
the performance specifications and have desirable robustness properties. 
Unfortunately, it is not immediately clear how to choose the parameters in the 
PID controller to obtain certain robustness characteristics. An illustrative exam￾ple will show that it is possible to choose the parameters iteratively and verify 
the robustness by simulation. Using the computer helps in this process, because 
the entire design and simulation can be automated using scripts and can easily be 
executed repeatedly.

Consider the feedback control system in Figure 12.16, where
( ) ( ) = +

and the nominal value is c0 = 1, and G s p ( ) = 1. We can design a compensator 
based on c0 = 1 and check robustness by simulation. Our design specifications are
1. A settling time (with a 2% criterion) Ts ≤ 0.5 s, and
2. An optimum ITAE performance for a step input.
For this design, we will not use a prefilter to meet specification (2), but will 
instead show that acceptable performance (i.e., low percent overshoot) can be 
obtained by increasing a cascade gain.

The settling time requirement Ts < 0.5 s leads us to choose the roots of s a + +s b 2
to the left of the s = −ζωn = −8 line in the s-plane, as shown in Figure 12.37, to 
ensure that the locus travels into the required s-plane region. We have chosen 
a = 16 and b = 70 to ensure the locus travels past the s = −8 line. We select a 
point on the root locus in the performance region, and using the rlocfind function, 
we find the associated gain Kˆ and the associated value of ωn. For our chosen 
point, we find that
Kˆ = 118.
Then, with Kˆ, a, and b, we can solve for the PID coefficients as follows:
K K D ˆ = − 2 = 116,  
K a P D = + ( ) 2 1 K − = 1887,  
K b I D = + ( ) 2 K = 8260.
To meet the overshoot performance requirements for a step input, we will use a 
cascade gain K that will be chosen by iterative methods using the step function, 
as illustrated in Figure 12.38. The step response corresponding to K = 5 has an

We do not use the prefilter. Instead, we increase the cascade gain K to obtain sat￾isfactory transient response. Now we can consider the question of robustness to 
changes in the plant parameter c0.
The investigation into the robustness of the design consists of a step response 
analysis using the PID controller given in Equation (12.57) for a range of plant 
parameter variations of 0.1 ≤ ≤ c0 10. The results are displayed in Figure 12.39. 
The script is written to compute the step response for a given c0. It can be conve￾nient to place the input of c0 at the command prompt level to make the script more 
interactive.
The simulation results indicate that the PID design is robust with respect to 
changes in c0. The differences in the step responses for 0.1 ≤ ≤ c0 10 are barely dis￾cernible on the plot. If the results showed otherwise, it would be possible to iterate 
on the design until an acceptable performance was achieved. The interactive capa￾bility of the m-file allows us to check the robustness by simulation. ■

12.11 SEQUENTIAL DESIGN EXAMPLE: DISK DRIVE READ SYSTEM
In this section, we design a PID controller to achieve the desired system response. 
Many disk drive head control systems use a PID controller and use a command 
signal r t( ) that utilizes an ideal velocity profile at the maximum allowable velocity 
until the head arrives near the desired track, when r t( ) is switched to a step-type 
input. Thus, we want zero steady-state error for a ramp (velocity) signal and a step 
signal. Examining the system shown in Figure 12.40, we note that the forward path 
possesses two pure integrations, and we expect zero steady-state error for a velocity 
input r t( ) = > At,  t 0.

12.12 SUMMARY
The design of highly accurate control systems in the presence of significant plant 
uncertainty requires the designer to seek a robust control system. A robust control 
system exhibits low sensitivities to parameter change and is stable over a wide range 
of parameter variations.
The PID controller was considered as a compensator to aid in the design of 
robust control systems. The design issue for a PID controller is the selection of 
the gain and two zeros of the controller transfer function. We used three design 
methods for the selection of the controller: the root locus method, the frequency 
response method, and the ITAE performance index method. An operational ampli￾fier circuit used for a PID controller is shown in Figure 12.43. In general, the use of 
a PID controller will enable the designer to attain a robust control system.

A robust control system provides stable, consistent performance as 
specified by the designer in spite of the wide variation of plant parameters 
and disturbances. It also provides a highly robust response to command inputs 
and a steady-state tracking error equal to zero.
For systems with uncertain parameters, the need for robust systems will require the 
incorporation of advanced machine intelligence, as shown in Figure 12.44.

P12.4 An automatically guided vehicle is shown in Figure 
P12.4(a) and its control system is shown in Figure 
P12.4(b). The goal is to track the guide wire accurately, 
to be insensitive to changes in the gain K , 1 and to

K1 is normally equal to 1 and τ = 1 10.

P12.5 A roll-wrapping machine (RWM) receives, wraps, 
and labels large paper rolls produced in a paper mill 
[9, 16]. The RWM consists of several major stations: 
positioning station, waiting station, wrapping sta￾tion, and so forth. We will focus on the positioning 
station shown in Figure P12.5(a). The positioning 
station is the first station that sees a paper roll. This 
station is responsible for receiving and weighing the 
roll, measuring its diameter and width, determining 
the desired wrap for the roll, positioning it for down￾stream processing, and finally ejecting it from the 
station.
Functionally, the RWM can be categorized as 
a complex operation because each functional step 
(e.g., measuring the width) involves a large number 
of field device actions and relies upon a number of 
accompanying sensors.
The control system for accurately positioning 
the width-measuring arm is shown in Figure P12.5(b). 
The pole p of the positioning arm is normally equal 
to 2, but it is subject to change because of loading 
and misalignment of the machine. (a) For p = 2,
design a compensator so that the P.O. ≤ 20% and 
Ts ≤ 1 s to a unit step input. (b) Plot y t( ) for a step

P12.6 The function of a steel plate mill is to roll reheated 
slabs into plates of scheduled thickness and dimen￾sion [5, 10]. The final products are of rectangular 
plane view shapes having a width of up to 3300 mm 
and a thickness of 180 mm.
A schematic layout of the mill is shown in Figure 
P12.6(a). The mill has two major rolling stands, de￾noted No. 1 and No. 2. These are equipped with large 
rolls (up to 508 mm in diameter), which are driven 
by high-power electric motors (up to 4470 kW). Roll 
gaps and forces are maintained by large hydraulic 
cylinders.
Typical operation of the mill can be described 
as follows. Slabs coming from the reheating furnace 
initially go through the No. 1 stand, whose function is 
to reduce the slabs to the required width. The slabs 
proceed through the No. 2 stand, where finishing 
passes are carried out to produce the required slab 
thickness. Finally, they go through the hot plate lev￾eller, which gives each plate a smooth finish.
One of the key systems controls the thickness of 
the plates by adjusting the rolls. The block diagram 
of this control system is shown in Figure P12.6(b).
The controller is a PID with two equal real 
zeros. (a) Select the PID zeros and the gains so that 
the closed-loop system has two pairs of equal roots.

P12.9 Future astronauts may drive on the Moon in a pres￾surized vehicle, shown in Figure P12.9(a), that would

vehicle, incorporating improvements in radiation and 
thermal protection, shock and vibration control, and 
lubrication and sealants.
The steering control of the moon buggy is
shown in Figure P12.9(b). The objective of the con￾trol design is to achieve a step response to a steering
command with zero steady-state error, a percent over￾shoot of P O. . ≤ 20%, and a peak time of TP ≤ 1 s. 
It is also necessary to determine the effect of a step 
disturbance T s( ) = s d 1 when R s( ) = 0, in order to 
ensure the reduction of moon surface effects. Using (a)

the convenience of an automobile. All these shared 
attributes notwithstanding, the maglev system is truly 
a new mode of travel and will enhance the other 
modes of travel by relieving congestion and provid￾ing connections among them. Maglev travel would be 
fast, operating at 150 to 300 miles per hour.
The tilt control of a maglev vehicle is illustrated 
in Figures AP12.2(a) and (b). The dynamics of the 
plant G s( ) are subject to variation so that the poles 
will lie within the boxes shown in Figure AP12.2(c), 
and 1 2 ≤ ≤ K .
The objective is to achieve a robust system with 
a step response possessing a percent overshoot of 
P O. . ≤ 10%, as well as a settling time (with a 2% cri￾terion) of Ts ≤ 2 s when u t( ) ≤ 100. Obtain a de￾sign with a PI, PD, and PID controller and compare 
the results. Use a prefilter G s p( ) if necessary.
AP12.3 Antiskid braking systems present a challenging 
control problem, since brake/automotive system pa￾rameter variations can vary significantly (e.g., due to 
the brake-pad coefficient of friction changes or road 
slope variations) and environmental influences (e.g., 
due to adverse road conditions). The objective of the 
antiskid system is to regulate wheel slip to maximize 
the coefficient of friction between the tire and road for 
any given road surface [8]. As we expect, the braking 
coefficient of friction is greatest for dry asphalt, slightly 
reduced for wet asphalt, and greatly reduced for ice.
A unity feedback simplified model of the brak￾ing system is represented by a plant transfer function 
G s( ) with

where normally a = 1 and b = 4.
a. Using a PID controller, design a very robust 
system where, for a step input, the percent over￾shoot is P O. . ≤ 4% and the settling time (with a 
2% criterion) is Ts ≤ 1 s. The steady-state error 
must be less than 1% for a step. We expect a and 
b to vary by ±50%.
b. Design a system to yield the specifications of part 
(a) using an ITAE performance index. Predict the 
percent overshoot and settling time for this design.
AP12.4 A robot has been designed to aid in hip￾replacement surgery. The device, called RoBoDoc, is 
used to precisely orient and mill the femoral cavity for 
acceptance of the prosthetic hip implant. Clearly, we 
want a very robust surgical tool control, because there 
is no opportunity to redrill a bone [21, 27]. The unity 
feedback control system has

margin of P M. . = 50° is required. Design a PID con￾troller for Gc (s), and determine the effect of param￾eter variations when the system gain K changes by
±50%. Plot the step response of the controlled system.

where K1 = 1.5 and τ = 0.001 s. Select a PID con￾troller so that the settling time (with a 2% criterion) 
for a step input is Ts ≤ 1 s and the percent overshoot 
is P O. . ≤ 10%. Also, the effect of a disturbance at the 
output must be reduced to less than 5% of the magni￾tude of the disturbance.

criterion) for a step input. Use a prefilter, if necessary.

DP12.3 Many university and government laboratories 
have constructed robot hands capable of grasping and 
manipulating objects. But teaching the artificial devices 
to perform even simple tasks required formidable com￾puter programming. However, a special hand device 
can be worn over a human hand to record the side-to￾side and bending motions of finger joints. Each joint is 
fitted with a sensor that changes its signal depending on 
position. The signals from all the sensors are translated 
into computer data and used to operate robot hands [1].
The joint angle control system is shown in 
part Figure DP12.3. The normal value of Km is 1.0. 
The goal is to design a PID controller so that the 
M12_DORF2374_14_GE_C12.indd 937 15/09/21 9:47 AM938 Chapter 12 Robust Control Systems
steady-state error for a ramp input is zero. Also, the 
settling time (with a 2% criterion) must be Ts ≤ 3 s 
for the ramp input. We want the controller to be

of its normal value and G s c ( ) remains as designed 
in part (a), obtain the ramp response of the system. 
Compare the results of parts (a) and (b) and discuss 
the robustness of the system.
DP12.4 Objects smaller than the wavelengths of visible 
light are a staple of contemporary science and tech￾nology. Biologists study single molecules of protein or 
DNA; materials scientists examine atomic-scale flaws 
in crystals; microelectronics engineers lay out circuit 
patterns only a few tenths of atoms thick. Until recently, 
this minute world could be seen only by cumbersome, 
often destructive methods, such as electron microscopy 
and X-ray diffraction. It lay beyond the reach of any 
instrument as simple and direct as the familiar light 
microscope. New microscopes, typified by the scanning 
tunneling microscope (STM), are now available [3].
The precision of position control required is in 
the order of nanometers. The STM relies on piezoelec￾tric sensors that change size when an electric voltage 
across the material is changed. The “aperture” in the 
STM is a tiny tungsten probe, its tip ground so fine that 
it may consist of only a single atom and measure just 
0.2 nanometer in width. Piezoelectric controls maneu￾ver the tip to within a nanometer or two of the surface 
of a conducting specimen—so close that the electron 
clouds of the atom at the probe tip and of the near￾est atom of the specimen overlap. A feedback mech￾anism senses the variations in tunneling current and 
varies the voltage applied to a third, z-axis, control. 
The z-axis piezoelectric moves the probe vertically to 
stabilize the current and to maintain a constant gap 
between the microscope’s tip and the surface. The 
control system is shown in Figure DP12.4(a), and the 
block diagram is shown in Figure DP12.4(b).

DP12.6 The use of control theory to provide insight into 
neurophysiology has a long history. As early as the 
beginning of the last century, many investigators de￾scribed a muscle control phenomenon caused by the 
feedback action of muscle spindles and by sensors 
based on a combination of muscle length and rate of 
change of muscle length.
This analysis of muscle regulation has been based 
on the theory of single-input, single-output control 
systems. An example is a proposal that the stretch re￾flex is an experimental observation of a motor control 
strategy, namely, control of individual muscle length 
by the spindles. Others later proposed the regula￾tion of individual muscle stiffness (by sensors of both 
length and force) as the motor control strategy [30].
One model of the human standing-balance mech￾anism is shown in Figure DP12.6. Consider the case of 
a paraplegic who has lost control of his standing mech￾anism. We propose to add an artificial controller to en￾able the person to stand and move his legs. (a) Design 
a controller when the normal values of the parameters 
are K a = = 10,   12, and b = 100, in order to achieve 
a step response with percent overshoot of P O. . ≤ 10%, 
steady-state error of ess ≤ 5%, and a settling time (with 
a 2% criterion) of Ts ≤ 2 s. Try a controller with pro￾portional gain, PI, PD, and PID. (b) When the person is 
fatigued, the parameters may change to K a = = 15,   8,
and b = 144. Examine the performance of this system 
with the controllers of part (a). Prepare a table contrast￾ing the results of parts (a) and (b).
DP12.7 The goal is to design an elevator control sys￾tem so that the elevator will move from floor to 
floor rapidly and stop accurately at the selected floor 
(Figure DP12.7). The elevator will contain from one 
to three occupants. However, the weight of the ele￾vator should be greater than the weight of the occu￾pants; you may assume that the elevator weighs 1000 
pounds and each occupant weighs 150 pounds. Design 
a system to accurately control the elevator to within 
one centimeter. Assume that the large DC motor is 
field-controlled. Also, assume that the time constant 
of the motor and load is one second, the time constant 
of the power amplifier driving the motor is one-half

DP12.8 A model of the feedback control system is shown 
in Figure DP12.8 for an electric ventricular assist 
device. This problem was introduced in AP9.11. The 
motor, pump, and blood sac can be modeled by a 
time delay with T = 1 s. The goal is to achieve a step 
response with less than 5% steady-state error and 
P O. . ≤ 10%. Furthermore, to prolong the batteries, 
the voltage is limited to 30 V [26]. Design a controller 
using (a) G s( ) = K s c , (b) a PI controller, and (c) a 
PID controller. In each case, also design the pre-filter. 
Compare the results for the three controllers by re￾cording in a table the percent overshoot, peak time, 
settling time (with 2% criterion) and the maximum 
value of v t( ).

DP12.11 Electromagnetic suspension systems for air￾cushioned trains are known as magnetic levitation 
(maglev) trains. One maglev train uses a supercon￾ducting magnet system [17]. It uses superconducting

where ωn is the natural frequency of the flexible 
mode, and ζ is the corresponding damping ratio. In 
general, it is difficult to know the structural damp￾ing precisely, while the natural frequency can be 
predicted more accurately using well-established 
modeling techniques. Assume the nominal values of 
ω ζ n = = 2 rad s,  0.005, and k = 0.1.
a. Design a lead compensator to meet the following 
specifications: (1) a closed-loop system response 
to a unit step input with a settling time (with a 2% 
criterion) Ts ≤ 200 s and (2) a percent overshoot 
of P O. . ≤ 50%.
b. With the controller from part (a), investigate 
the closed-loop system unit step response with 
ζ = 0, 0.005,  0.1, and 1. Co-plot the various unit 
step responses and discuss the results.
c. From a control system point of view, is it preferable 
to have the actual flexible structure damping less 
than or greater than the design value? Explain.
CP12.6 The industrial process shown in Figure CP12.6 is 
known to have a time delay in the loop. In practice, it 
is often the case that the magnitude of system time de￾lays cannot be precisely determined. The magnitude of 
the time delay may change in an unpredictable manner 
depending on the process environment. A robust con￾trol system should be able to operate satisfactorily in 
the presence of the system time delays.
a. Develop an m-file script to compute and plot the 
phase margin for the industrial process in Figure 
CP12.6 when the time delay, T, varies between 
0 and 5 seconds. Use the pade function with a 
second-order approximation to approximate the 
time delay. Plot the phase margin as a function of 
the time delay.
b. Determine the maximum time delay allowable 
for system stability. Use the plot generated in 
part (a) to compute the maximum time delay 
approximately.

CP12.8 The Gamma-Ray Imaging Device (GRID) is a 
NASA experiment to be flown on a long-duration, 
high-altitude balloon during the coming solar maxi￾mum. The GRID on a balloon is an instrument that 
will qualitatively improve hard X-ray imaging and 
carry out the first gamma-ray imaging for the study 
of solar high-energy phenomena in the next phase 
of peak solar activity. From its long-duration bal￾loon platform, GRID will observe numerous hard 
X-ray bursts, coronal hard X-ray sources, “superhot” 
thermal events, and microflares [2]. Figure CP12.8(a) 
depicts the GRID payload attached to the balloon. 
The major components of the GRID experiment con￾sist of a 5.2-meter canister and mounting gondola, a 
high-altitude balloon, and a cable connecting the gon￾dola and balloon. The instrument–sun pointing re￾quirements of the experiment are 0.1 degree pointing 
accuracy and 0.2 arcsecond per 4 ms pointing stability.
An optical sun sensor provides a measure of the 
sun–instrument angle and is modeled as a first-order 
system with a DC gain and a pole at s = −500. A 
torque motor actuates the canister/gondola assem￾bly. The azimuth angle control system is shown in 
Figure CP12.8(b). The PID controller is selected by

of KD, a, and b so that the dominant roots have a 
damping ratio ζ = 0.8 and the percent overshoot to 
a step input is P O. . ≤ 3%. Develop a simulation to 
study the control system performance. Use a step re￾sponse to confirm the percent overshoot meets the 
specification.

PREVIEW
A digital computer often hosts the controller algorithm in a feedback control 
system. Since the computer receives data only at specific intervals, it is necessary 
to develop a method for describing and analyzing the performance of computer 
control systems. In this chapter, we provide an introduction to the topic of digital 
control systems. The notion of a sampled-data system is presented followed by a 
discussion of the z-transform. We may use the z-transform of a transfer function 
to analyze the stability and transient response of a system. The basics of closed￾loop stability with a digital controller in the loop are covered with a short presen￾tation on the role of root locus in the design process. This chapter concludes with 
the design of a digital controller for the Sequential Design Example: Disk Drive 
Read System.
DESIRED OUTCOMES
Upon completion of Chapter 13, students should be able to:
❏ Explain the role of digital computers in control system design 
and application.
❏ Describe the z-transform and sampled-data systems.
❏ Design digital controllers using root locus methods.
❏ Identify the potential issues of implementing digital controllers.

13.1 INTRODUCTION
The use of digital computer compensator (controller) devices continues to increase 
as the price and reliability of digital computers improves [1, 2]. A block diagram of 
a single-loop digital control system is shown in Figure 13.1. The digital computer in 
this system configuration receives the error in digital form and performs calculations 
in order to provide an output in digital form. The computer may be programmed 
to provide an output so that the performance of the process is near or equal to the 
desired performance. Many computers are able to receive and manipulate several 
inputs, so a digital computer control system can often be a multivariable system.
A digital computer receives and operates on signals in digital (numerical) form, 
as contrasted to continuous signals [3]. A digital control system uses digital signals 
and a digital computer to control a process. The measurement data are converted 
from analog form to digital form by means of the analog-to-digital converter shown 
in Figure 13.1. After processing the inputs, the digital computer provides an output 
in digital form. This output is then converted to analog form by the digital-to-analog 
converter shown in Figure 13.1.
13.2 DIGITAL COMPUTER CONTROL SYSTEM APPLICATIONS
A digital computer consists of a central processing unit (CPU), input–output units, 
and a memory unit. The size and power of a computer will vary according to the size, 
speed, and power of the CPU, as well as the size, speed, and organization of the mem￾ory unit. Powerful but inexpensive computers, called microcomputers are everywhere. 
These systems use a microprocessor as a CPU. Therefore, the nature of the control 
task, the extent of the data required in memory, and the speed of calculation required 
will dictate the selection of the computer within the range of available computers.
The size of computers and the cost for the active logic devices used to construct 
them have both declined exponentially. The active components per cubic centime￾ter have increased so that the actual computer can be reduced in size to the point 
where relatively inexpensive, powerful laptop computers are providing mobile 
high-performance computational capability to students and professionals alike, and 
are, in many instances, replacing traditional desktop microcomputers. The speed 
of computers has also increased exponentially. The transistor density (a measure 
of computational performance) on microprocessor integrated circuits has increased 
exponentially over the last 40 years, as illustrated in Figure 13.2. In fact, accord￾ing to “Moore’s law,” the transistor density doubles every year, and will probably

continue to do so. Significant progress in computation capability has been and will 
continue to be made. Clearly, improvements in computational capability have revo￾lutionized the application of control theory and design in the modern era.
Digital control systems are used in many applications: for machine tools, 
metal-working processes, biomedical, environmental, chemical processes, aircraft 
control, and automobile traffic control, and many others [4–8]. An example of a com￾puter control system used in the aircraft industry is shown in Figure 13.3. Automatic 
computer-controlled systems are used for purposes as diverse as measuring the 
objective refraction of the human eye and controlling the engine spark timing or 
air–fuel ratio of automobile engines.
The advantages of using digital control include improved measurement sensitiv￾ity; the use of digitally coded signals, digital sensors and transducers, and micropro￾cessors; reduced sensitivity to signal noise; and the capability to easily reconfigure

the control algorithm in software. Improved sensitivity results from the low-energy 
signals required by digital sensors and devices. The use of digitally coded signals 
permits the wide application of digital devices and communications. Digital sensors 
and transducers can effectively measure, transmit, and couple signals and devices. 
In addition, many systems are inherently digital because they send out pulse signals.
13.3 SAMPLED-DATA SYSTEMS
Computers used in control systems are interconnected to the actuator and the pro￾cess by means of signal converters. The output of the computer is processed by a 
digital-to-analog converter. We will assume that all the numbers that enter or leave 
the computer do so at the same fixed period T, called the sampling period. Thus, for 
example, the reference input shown in Figure 13.4 is a sequence of sample values 
r(kT). The variables r(kT), m(kT), and u(kT) are discrete signals in contrast to m(t)
and y(t), which are continuous functions of time.
Sampled data (or a discrete signal) are data obtained for the system variables 
only at discrete intervals and are denoted as x(kT).
A system where part of the system acts on sampled data is called a sampled-data 
system. A sampler is basically a switch that closes every T seconds for one instant of 
time. Consider an ideal sampler, as shown in Figure 13.5. The input is r(t), and the 
output is r t * , ( ) where nT is the current sample time, and the current value of r t *( )
is r(nT). We then have r t * , ( ) = − r n( ) T t δ( ) nT where δ is the impulse function.
Let us assume that we sample a signal r(t), as shown in Figure 13.5, and obtain 
r t * . ( ) Then, we portray the series for r t *( ) as a string of impulses starting at t = 0,
spaced at T seconds, and of amplitude r(kT). For example, consider the input signal 
r(t) shown in Figure 13.6(a). The sampled signal is shown in Figure 13.6(b) with an 
impulse represented by a vertical arrow of magnitude r(kT).
A digital-to-analog converter serves as a device that converts the sampled sig￾nal r t *( ) to a continuous signal p(t). The digital-to-analog converter can usually be

represented by a zero-order hold circuit, as shown in Figure 13.7. The zero-order 
hold takes the value r(kT) and holds it constant for kT ≤ <t k( ) + 1 , T as shown in 
Figure 13.8 for k = 0. Thus, we use r(kT) during the sampling period.
A sampler and zero-order hold can accurately follow the input signal if T is 
small compared to the transient changes in the signal. The response of a sampler 
and zero-order hold for a ramp input is shown in Figure 13.9. Finally, the response 
of a sampler and zero-order hold for an exponentially decaying signal is shown in 
Figure 13.10 for two values of the sampling period. Clearly, the output p(t) will 
approach the input r(t) as T approaches zero, meaning that we sample frequently.

The precision of the digital computer and the associated signal converters is limited. 
Precision is the degree of exactness or discrimination with which a quantity is stated. 
The precision of the computer is limited by a finite word length. The precision of the 
analog-to-digital converter is limited by an ability to store its output only in digital logic 
composed of a finite number of binary digits. The converted signal m(kT) is then said 
to include an amplitude quantization error. When the quantization error and the error 
due to the computer finite word size are small relative to the amplitude of the signal 
[13, 16], the system is sufficiently precise, and the precision limitations can be neglected.
13.4 THE z-TRANSFORM
Because the output of the ideal sampler, r t * , ( ) is a series of impulses with values 
r(kT), we have

We now have an infinite series that involves multiples of esT and its powers. We 
define
z esT = , (13.4)
where this relationship involves a conformal mapping from the s-plane to the z-plane. 
We then define a new transform, called the z-transform, so that

A table of z-transforms is given in Table 13.1 and at the MCS website. Note that 
we use the same letter to denote both the Laplace and z-transforms, distinguishing 
them by the argument s or z. A table of properties of the z-transform is given in 
Table 13.2. As in the case of Laplace transforms, we are ultimately interested in the 
output y(t) of the system. Therefore, we must use an inverse transform to obtain 
y(t) from Y(z). We may obtain the output by (1) expanding Y(z) in a power series, 
(2) expanding Y(z) into partial fractions and using Table 13.1 to obtain the inverse 
of each term, or (3) obtaining the inverse z-transform by an inversion integral. We 
will limit our methods to (1) and (2) in this limited discussion.

We have determined Y(z), the z-transform of the output sampled signal. 
The z-transform of the input sampled signal is R(z). The transfer function in the 
z-domain is

Since we determined the sampled output, we can use an output sampler to depict 
this condition, as shown in Figure 13.12; this represents the system of Figure 13.11 
with the sampled input passing to the process. We assume that both samplers have 
the same sampling period and operate synchronously. Then
Y z( ) = G z( )R z( ), (13.19)
as required. We may represent Equation (13.19), which is a z-transform equation, 
by the block diagram of Figure 13.13.
13.5 CLOSED-LOOP FEEDBACK SAMPLED-DATA SYSTEMS
In this section, we consider closed-loop, sampled-data control systems. Consider the 
system shown in Figure 13.14(a). The sampled-data z-transform model of this figure

A linear continuous feedback control system is stable if all poles of the closed-loop 
transfer function T(s) lie in the left half of the s-plane. The z-plane is related to the 
s-plane by the transformation
z e e sT j T = = . ( ) σ ω + (13.26)
We may also write this relationship as
z e = σT
and
z T = ω . (13.27)
In the left-hand s-plane, σ < 0; therefore, the related magnitude of z varies be￾tween 0 and 1. Thus, the imaginary axis of the s-plane corresponds to the unit circle 
in the z-plane, and the inside of the unit circle corresponds to the left half of the 
s-plane [14].
Therefore, we can state that the stability of a sampled-data system exists if all 
the poles of the closed-loop transfer function T(z) lie within the unit circle of the 
z-plane.
EXAMPLE 13.5 Stability of a closed-loop system
Let us consider the system shown in Figure 13.18 when T = 1 and
G s K

where a = 0.3678 and b = 0.2644.
The poles of the closed-loop transfer function T(z) are the roots of the equation 
1 0 + = G z( ) . We call q z( ) = +1 0 G z( ) = the characteristic equation. Therefore, 
we obtain

When K = 1, we have

= − ( ) z j 0.50 + − 0.6182 ( ) z j 0.50 − = 0.6182 0. (13.31)
Therefore, the system is stable because the roots lie within the unit circle. When 
K = 10, we have
q z z z 2.310 3.012 2 ( ) = + +
= + ( ) z j 1.155 + + 1.295 ( ) z j 1.155 − 1.295 , (13.32)
and the system is unstable because both roots lie outside the unit circle. This sys￾tem is stable for 0 < < K 2.39. The locus of the roots as K varies is discussed in 
Section 13.8.
We notice that a second-order sampled system can be unstable with increas￾ing gain where a second-order continuous system is stable for all values of gain 
(assuming both the poles of the open-loop system lie in the left half s-plane). ■
13.6 PERFORMANCE OF A SAMPLED-DATA, SECOND-ORDER SYSTEM
Consider the performance of a sampled second-order system with a zero-order 
hold, as shown in Figure 13.18, when the process is
τ
( ) ( ) = +
G s K

where E e T = . − τ The stability of the system is analyzed by considering the charac￾teristic equation
q z z z K T 1 1 E E K E 1 0 TE E . 2 ( ) = + { } [ ] − − τ τ ( ) − + ( ) + − [ ] ( )− + =
(13.35)
Because the polynomial q(z) is a quadratic and has real coefficients, the necessary 
and sufficient conditions for q(z) to have all its roots within the unit circle are
q q ( ) 0 1 < > , 1( ) 0, and 1 q( ) − > 0.
These stability conditions for a second-order system can be established by mapping 
the z-plane characteristic equation into the s-plane and checking for positive coef￾ficients of q(s). Using these conditions, we establish the necessary conditions from 
Equation (13.35) as

for a stable system. The maximum gain allowable is given in Table 13.3 for several 
values of T τ. It is possible to set T τ = 0.1 and vary K to obtain system characteris￾tics approaching those of a continuous (nonsampled) system. The maximum percent 
overshoot of the second-order system for a unit step input is shown in Figure 13.19.
The integral squared error performance criterion can be written as
∫ τ = ( ) ∞

The loci of this criterion are given in Figure 13.20 for constant values of I. For a

value of Kτ. The optimal curve shown in Figure 13.20 indicates the required Kτ
for a specified T τ that minimizes I. For example, when T τ = 0.75, we require 
Kτ = 1 in order to minimize the performance criterion I.
The steady-state error for a unit ramp input r t( ) = t is shown in Figure 13.21. 
For a given T τ, we can reduce the steady-state error, but then the system yields a 
greater overshoot and settling time for a step input.
EXAMPLE 13.6 Design of a sampled system
Consider a closed-loop sampled system as shown in Figure 13.18 when
G s K
s s p 0.1 1 ( ) . ( ) = + (13.39)
We seek to select T and K for suitable performance. We use Figures 13.19–13.21 to 
select K and T for τ = 0.1. Limiting the percent overshoot to P.O. = 30% for the 
step input, we select T τ = 0.25, yielding Kτ = 1.4. For these values, the steady￾state error for a unit ramp input is approximately ess = 0.6 (see Figure 13.21).
Because τ = 0.1, we then set T = 0.025 s and K = 14. The sampling rate is 40 
samples per second. The percent overshoot to the step input and the steady-state 
error for a ramp input may be reduced if we set T τ to 0.1. The percent overshoot 
to a step input will be P.O. = 25% for Kτ = 1.6. Using Figure 13.21, we estimate 
that the steady-state error for a unit ramp input is ess = 0.55 for Kτ = 1.6. ■

If we calculate the response of the system to a unit step, we find that the out￾put is equal to the input at the fourth sampling instant and thereafter. The responses 
for both the uncompensated and the compensated system are shown in Figure 13.22. 
The overshoot of the compensated system is 4%, whereas the percent overshoot of 
the uncompensated system is P.O. = 45%. It is beyond the objective of this book

to discuss all the extensive methods for the analytical selection of the parameters of 
D(z); other texts [2–4] can provide further information. However, we will consider 
two methods of compensator design: (1) the Gc(s)-to-D(z) conversion method (in the 
following paragraphs) and (2) the root locus z-plane method (in Section 13.8).
One method for determining D(z) first determines a controller Gc(s) for a 
given process Gp(s) for the system shown in Figure 13.23. Then, the controller is 
converted to D(z) for the given sampling period T. This design method is called the 
Gc(s)-to-D(z) conversion method. It converts the Gc(s) of Figure 13.23 to D(z) of 
Figure 13.15 [7].
We consider a first-order compensator
G s K s a
s b c ( ) = +
+ (13.46)
and a digital controller
D z C z A
z B ( ) = . −
− (13.47)
We determine the z-transform corresponding to Gc(s) and set it equal to D(z) as
Z G{ } c ( )s D = ( )z . (13.48)
Then the relationship between the two transfer functions is A e B e aT bT = = ,   , − −
and when s = 0, we require that

phase margin is P M. . = 2°. Consider the phase-lead compensator

We select K in order to yield G j G j 20 c   log10 ( ) ω ω ( ) = 0 when ω ω = =c 125  rad s
yielding K = 5.0. The compensator Gc(s) is to be realized by D(z), so we solve 
the relationships with a selected sampling period. Setting T = 0.003 s, we have

Of course, if we select another value for the sampling period, then the coefficients 
of D(z) would differ. ■
In general, we select a small sampling period so that the design based on the 
continuous system will accurately carry over to the z-plane. However, we should 
not select too small a T, or the computation requirements may be more than nec￾essary. In general, we use a sampling period T f ≈ 1 1( ) 0 , B where fB B = ω π ( ) 2 ,
and ωB is the bandwidth of the closed-loop continuous system. The bandwidth of 
the system designed in Example 13.7 is ωB = 208  rad s or fB = 33.2 Hz. Thus, we 
select a period T = 0.003 s.
13.8 THE ROOT LOCUS OF DIGITAL CONTROL SYSTEMS
Consider the transfer function of the system shown in Figure 13.24. Recall that 
G s( ) = G s 0( )G s p( ). The closed-loop transfer function is

Thus, we can plot the root locus for the characteristic equation of the sampled sys￾tem as K varies. The rules for obtaining the root locus are summarized in Table 13.4.

in Figure 13.25. The unit circle is also shown in Figure 13.25. The system always 
has two roots outside the unit circle and is always unstable for all K > 0.

We then use z a − to cancel one pole at G(z) that lies on the positive real axis of the 
z-plane. Then we select z b − so that the locus of the compensated system will give 
a set of complex roots at a desired point within the unit circle on the z-plane.
EXAMPLE 13.9 Design of a digital compensator
Let us design a compensator D(z) that will result in a stable system when G s p ( ) is 
as described in Example 13.8. With D z( ) = 1, we have an unstable system. Select

Using the equation for F( ) σ , we obtain the entry point as z = −2.56, as shown in 
Figure 13.26. The root locus is on the unit circle at K = 0.8. Thus, the system is sta￾ble for K < 0.8. If we select K = 0.25, we find that the step response has a percent 
overshoot of P.O. = 20% and a settling time (with a 2% criterion) Ts = 8.5 s. ■
We can draw lines of constant ζ on the z-plane. The mapping between the 
s-plane and the z-plane is obtained by the relation z e = sT. The lines of constant ζ

We can determine a digital implementation of this controller using a discrete ap￾proximation for the derivative and integration. For the time derivative, we use the 
backward difference rule

The integration of x t( ) can be represented by the forward rectangular integration
at t k = T as
u k( ) T u = − ( ) ( ) k T1 , + Tx( ) kT (13.56)
where u k( ) T is the output of the integrator at t k = T. The z-transform of Equation 
(13.56) is
U z z U z TX z , 1 ( ) = + ( ) ( ) −
and the transfer function is then

The complete difference equation algorithm that provides the PID controller is

Equation (13.58) can be implemented using a digital computer or microprocessor. Of 
course, we can obtain a PI or PD controller by setting an appropriate gain equal to zero.
13.10 DESIGN EXAMPLES
In this section we present two illustrative examples. In the first example, two control￾lers are designed to control the motor and lead screw of a movable worktable. Using 
a zero-order hold formulation, a proportional controller and a lead compensator 
M13_DORF2374_14_GE_C13.indd 968 15/09/21 10:02 AMSection 13.10 Design Examples 969
are obtained and their performance compared. In the second example, a control 
system is designed to control an aircraft control surface as part of a fly-by-wire 
system. Using root locus methods, the design process focuses on the design of 
a digital controller to meet settling time and percent overshoot performance 
specifications.
EXAMPLE 13.10 Worktable motion control system
An important positioning system in manufacturing systems is a worktable motion 
control system. The system controls the motion of a worktable at a certain location 
[18]. We assume that the table is activated in each axis by a motor and lead screw, 
as shown in Figure 13.28(a). We consider the x-axis and examine the motion control 
for a feedback system, as shown in Figure 13.28(b). The goal is to obtain a fast re￾sponse with a rapid rise time and settling time to a step command while not exceed￾ing a percent overshoot of P O. . = 5%.
The specifications are then (1) a percent overshoot equal to P O. . = 5% and 
(2) a minimum settling time (with a 2% criterion) and rise time.
To configure the system, we choose a power amplifier and motor so that the 
system is described by Figure 13.29. Obtaining the transfer function of the motor 
and power amplifier, we have

The root locus is shown in Figure 13.30 when a = 30 and b = 25. In Figure 13.30, 
the desired region for the pole placement is shown consistent with a targeted per￾cent overshoot P O. . ≤ 5% (corresponding to ζ ≥ 0.69). The selected point corre￾sponds to K = 545. The actual percent overshoot is P O. . = 5%, the settling time is 
Ts = 1.18 s, and the rise time Tr = 0.4 s, therefore, the performance specifications 
are satisfied. The final controller design is

EXAMPLE 13.11 Fly-by-wire aircraft control surface
Increasing constraints on weight, performance, fuel consumption, and reliability 
created a need for the flight control system known as fly-by-wire. This approach im￾plies that particular system components are interconnected electrically rather than 
mechanically and that they operate under the supervision of a computer responsi￾ble for monitoring, controlling, and coordinating the tasks. The fly-by-wire princi￾ple allows for the implementation of totally digital and highly redundant control 
systems reaching a remarkable level of reliability and performance [19].
Operational characteristics of a flight control system depend on the dynamic 
stiffness of an actuator, which represents its ability to maintain the position of the 
control surface in spite of the disturbing effects of random external forces. One 
flight actuator system consists of a special type of DC motor, driven by a power am￾plifier, which drives a hydraulic pump that is connected to either side of a hydrau￾lic cylinder. The piston of the hydraulic cylinder is directly connected to a control 
surface of an aircraft through some appropriate mechanical linkage, as shown in 
Figure 13.31. The elements of the design process emphasized in this example are 
highlighted in Figure 13.32.

The control goal is to design a compensator, D(z), so that the control surface angle 
Y s( ) = θ( )s tracks the desired angle, denoted by R s( ). We state the control goal as

For a simple compensator, D z( ) = K, the root locus is shown in Figure 13.33. 
For stability we require K < 21. Using an iterative approach we discover that as 
K → 21, the step response is very oscillatory, and the percent overshoot is too 
large; conversely, as K gets smaller, the settling time gets too long, although the 
percent overshoot decreases. In any case the design specifications cannot be sat￾isfied with a simple proportional controller, D z( ) = K. We need to utilize a more 
sophisticated controller.
We have the freedom to select the controller type. As with control design for 
continuous-time systems, the choice of compensator is always a challenge and 
problem-dependent. Here we choose a compensator with the general structure
D z K z a
z b ( ) = . −

For continuous systems we know that a design rule-of-thumb formula for the 
settling time is

As shown previously we can draw lines of constant ζ on the z-plane. The lines of 
constant ζ on the s-plane are radial lines with
 tan sin

Then, with s j = +σ ω and using the transform z esT = , we have
z e e T j T = . −σω ω (13.68)
For a given ζ, we can plot Re(z) vs Im(z) for z given in Equation (13.68).
If we were working with a second-order transfer function in the s-domain, 
we would need to have the damping ratio associated with the dominant roots be 
greater than ζ ≥ 0.69. When ζ ≥ 0.69, the percent overshoot for a second-order 
system (with no zeros) will be P.O. … 5%. The curves of constant ζ on the z-plane 
will define the region in the z-plane where we need to place the dominant z-plane 
poles to meet the percent overshoot specification.
The root locus in Figure 13.33 is repeated in Figure 13.34 with the stability and 
desired performance regions included. We can see that the root locus does not lie 
in the intersection of the stability and performance regions. The question is how 
to select the controller parameters K, a, and b so that the root locus lies in the 
desired regions.
One approach to the design is to choose a such that the pole of G(z) at 
z = 0.9048 is cancelled. Then we must select b so that the root locus lies in the 
desired region. For example, when a = −0.9048 and b = 0.25, the compensated 
root locus appears as shown in Figure 13.35. The root locus lies inside the perfor￾mance region, as desired.

13.11 DIGITAL CONTROL SYSTEMS USING CONTROL DESIGN SOFTWARE
The process of designing and analyzing sampled-data systems is enhanced with 
the use of interactive computer tools. Many of the control design functions for 
continuous-time control design have equivalent counterparts for sampled-data 
systems. Discrete-time transfer function model objects are obtained with the tf func￾tion. Figure 13.37 illustrates the use of tf. Model conversion can be accomplished 
with the functions c2d and d2c, shown in Figure 13.37. The function c2d con￾verts continuous-time systems to discrete-time systems; the function d2c converts 
discrete-time systems to continuous-time systems. For example, consider the process

The functions step, impulse, and Isim are used for simulation of sampled-data 
systems. The unit step response is generated by step. The step function format 
is shown in Figure 13.39. The unit impulse response is generated by the function 
impulse, and the response to an arbitrary input is obtained by the Isim function. 
The impulse and Isim functions are shown in Figures 13.40 and 13.41, respectively. 
These sampled-data system simulation functions operate in essentially the same 
manner as their counterparts for continuous-time (unsampled) systems. The output 
is y(kT) and is shown as y(kT) held constant for the period T.

we have the problem in a form for which the root locus method is directly 
applicable. The rlocus function works for discrete-time systems in the same way 
as for continuous-time systems. Using a m-file script, the root locus associated with 
Equation (13.70) is easily generated, as shown in Figure 13.44. Remember that 
the stability region is defined by the unit circle in the complex plane. The function 
rlocfind can be used with the discrete-time system root locus in exactly the same 
way as for continuous-time systems to determine the value of the system gain as￾sociated with any point on the locus. Using rlocfind, we determine that K = 4.639
places the roots on the unit circle. ■

13.12 SEQUENTIAL DESIGN EXAMPLE: DISK DRIVE READ SYSTEM
In this chapter, we design a digital controller for the disk drive system. As the disk 
rotates, the sensor head reads the patterns used to provide the reference error 
information. This error information pattern is read intermittently as the head reads 
the stored data, and then the pattern in turn. Because the disk is rotating at a constant 
speed, the time T between position-error readings is a constant. This sampling 
period is typically 100 μs to 1 ms [20]. Thus, we have sampled error information. We 
may also use a digital controller, as shown in Figure 13.45, to achieve a satisfactory 
system response. In this section, we will design D(z).
First, we determine

13.13 SUMMARY
The use of a digital computer as the compensation device for a closed-loop con￾trol system has grown during the past two decades as the price and reliability of 
computers have improved dramatically. A computer can be used to complete many 
calculations during the sampling interval T and to provide an output signal that is 
used to drive an actuator of a process. Computer control is used today for chemical 
processes, aircraft control, machine tools, and many common processes.
The z-transform can be used to analyze the stability and response of a sampled 
system and to design appropriate systems incorporating a computer. Computer con￾trol systems have become increasingly common as low-cost computers have become 
readily available.

speed and the wheel speed (normalized by the ve￾hicle speed for braking and the wheel speed for ac￾celeration), is chosen as the controlled variable for 
most of the traction-control algorithm because of its 
strong influence on the tractive force between the

DP13.5 Plastic extrusion is a well-established method 
widely used in the polymer processing industry [12]. 
Such extruders typically consist of a large barrel di￾vided into several temperature zones, with a hopper at 
one end and a die at the other. Polymer is fed into the 
barrel in raw and solid form from the hopper and is 
pushed forward by a powerful screw. Simultaneously, 
it is gradually heated while passing through the var￾ious temperature zones set in gradually increasing 
temperatures. The heat produced by the heaters in 
the barrel, together with the heat released from the 
friction between the raw polymer and the surfaces of 
the barrel and the screw, eventually causes the melt￾ing of the polymer, which is then pushed by the screw 
out from the die, to be processed further for various 
purposes.
The output variables are the outflow from the die 
and the polymer temperature. The main controlling 
variable is the screw speed, since the response of the
