Foreword
Noise has long been the Cinderella pollution for people and the environment, mainly 
because there are so many different characteristics to account for, different sources of 
noise from house parties and hi-fi systems to industrial noise, and different impacts on 
people because of their different sensibilities. The damage noise causes to employees 
in the workplace began to be recognised along with health and safety at work, but 
in the wider environment, the fact that over the years the courts looked at noise in 
the context of its relevant locality has tended to mask the invidious impact of noise 
on individuals. The EU Environmental Noise Directive eventually recognised the 
impact of noise on human health and well-being and the World Health Organisation 
has recognised that noise can affect human health.
This book, by Francis McManus, who has had a long-term interest in the law of 
nuisance, including noise nuisance, with Andy McKenzie, who has had a forty year 
career in noise consultancy and acoustics research, brings together the law and science 
of the impact of noise on human beings. This book is a very valuable contribution 
to this neglected area of the law. Lawyers need to understand the science behind 
noise, including basic acoustics and the perception of sound and measuring sound, 
and its impact, before they can properly advise. The detailed historical background to 
noise legislation is well informed and set the current law in context with very helpful 
chapters on subjects such as neighbourhood noise, traffic noise, human rights and the 
role of planning and noise.
While this book deals with noise in the human context there is increasing 
evidence that noise impacts on wildlife and ecosystems, but that is for another day.
This book is highly commended and should be on the bookshelf of every lawyer 
who deals with the environment and is likely to act for clients where noise is an issue, 
as it is increasingly in the planning field.

Preface
Noise is not a topic which, thus far, has commanded the attention of environmentalists 
in a way that more emotive issues, such as climate change, have done. However, it 
is beyond dispute that noise has the capacity to have a negative impact on human 
health and, indeed, the natural environment, as a whole. Noise emanates from a 
variety of sources and human activities, ranging from heavy industry to traffic noise, 
noise from recreational activities, noise in the workplace and also to neighbourhood 
noise. This state of affairs has required Parliament, over the years, to deal with the 
corresponding impact of noise on society in different ways, by passing a mosaic of 
legislation that has required balancing the rights of the noise maker with that of the 
recipient of the noise.
At the time of writing, the UK has left the EU, which had been active in certain 
areas, including addressing noise from transport, environmental assessment and 
noise mapping. It will be interesting to observe how noise law and policy will develop 
in the absence of the EU.
Environment is a devolved function in the UK and, therefore, under the control 
of the relevant national legislatures and governments. However, the substantive 
law (for example, the law relating to common law nuisance, statutory nuisance, 
environmental assessment and planning), which is discussed in this book, does not 
differ significantly over the four jurisdictions. The book concentrates on noise law as 
it relates to England, Scotland and Wales. The authors have refrained from discussing 
the law relating to Northern Ireland, since it is considered that this merits separate 
treatment. 
The book is intended to provide practitioners and students with an introduction 
to the scientific background to noise, as well as a comprehensive and detailed account 
of the substantive law relating to the control of noise. Noise and Noise Law includes 
an account of common law nuisance, statutory nuisance, neighbourhood noise, noise 
and human rights, transport noise, noise mapping, town and country planning and 
noise in the workplace. 
Francis McManus wrote the legal chapters, namely chs 1 and 4–11, inclusive. 
Andy McKenzie wrote the technical and scientific chapters, namely, chs 2 and 3.
Francis McManus would like to thank the following for their help in the 
production of this book, namely; Ronald E Conway, Jim Kerr, Nigel Rodgers, John 
Stewart, Henry Thoresby, Val Weedon, the Ministry of Defence and the Health and 
Safety Executive. However, any errors or other shortcomings in the book rest firmly 
with the authors. The authors would also like to thank Edinburgh University Press 
for their help over the past eighteen months.

Andy McKenzie would like to dedicate his chapters to Marcus Trinick KC, with 
the greatest respect, and with whom he has had the pleasure, on many occasions, of 
discussing the complexities of noise generation, perception and control, over a glass 
or two, often until the early hours of the morning!
The law is stated in force on 1 July 2022. However, it has been possible to take 
account of some developments at a later date.

Introduction
THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOISE LAW AND POLICY
Unwanted sound or noise is indeed unique, in that it has prompted individuals who 
have been affected to commit murder.1
 Noise also enjoys the dubious distinction 
of having been used as an instrument of torture.2
 Environmental noise has been 
perennial in the UK since the Industrial Revolution. However, unlike other forms 
of pollution, noise has not been an emotive subject in the eyes of the general public. 
Individuals tend only to take an active interest in noise if they are personally affected. 
However, the importance of noise pollution is clear and beyond dispute. The World 
Health Organisation (WHO) has recognised that noise seriously harms human 
health and also interferes with peoples’ daily activities at work, at home and during 
leisure time.3
 Noise can disturb sleep, cause cardiovascular and psychophysiological 
effects, reduce performance and also provoke annoyance responses and changes in 
social behaviour. The WHO expressed the view that traffic noise alone was harmful 
to the health of every third person in the WHO European region. Finally, one in 
five Europeans was exposed to sound levels at night that could significantly damage 
health. However, notwithstanding its importance, in terms of the development of 
environmental regulation as a whole, noise ranks as the Cinderella.4
 The lowly status 
of noise is no doubt due to the nature of noise. Noise is, of course, invisible. It leaves 
no residue and, therefore, does not have a ‘fallout’ factor. There can never be a noise 
disaster of a similar nature to that which afflicted either Bhopal or Seveso. Noise 
almost seems to have been tacitly accepted by society as the inevitable consequence 
of modern life. Indeed, in the Court of Appeal case of AG v Hastings Corp,
5
 Tucker LJ 
laconically observed that, ‘we move in an age of noise’. However, before proceeding 
to discuss the modern substantive law relating to noise, it is useful to give a brief 
mention of its chronological development.

1 IntroductionNOISE AND NOISE LAW

The nineteenth century
During the nineteenth century there was no national legislation that dealt with the 
subject of noise. Documentary evidence relating to noise pollution in the UK is 
sparse. However, given that heavy machinery was often employed in factories, etc. 
coupled with the fact that, due to poor planning controls, factories were often situated 
close to dwelling houses, noise must have been a widespread problem. Certain local 
authorities did, however, have byelaws (some of which survive today) that proscribed 
certain types of noise, for example, the playing of musical instruments on the streets, 
etc. to the annoyance of the general public.6
 However, such byelaws really only 
succeeded in scratching the surface of the problem. 
The twentieth century
As far as the twentieth century was concerned, until 1960 there was no national 
legislation which dealt with noise. However, an effective pressure group7
 managed 
to secure the passing (by way a private member’s Bill) of the Noise Abatement Act 
1960 (repealed). The Act was rather unadventurous in that it simply grafted noise 
pollution on to the list of statutory nuisances that could be dealt with by a local 
authority, either under the Public Health Act 1936 or, in Scotland, by the Public 
Health (Scotland) Act 1897 (repealed). Little thought seems to have been accorded 
as to whether the rather technical law of nuisance was the appropriate instrument 
to deal with environmental noise in the community. The fact that it had to take a 
pressure group to effect a change in the law was, quite possibly, indicative not only 
of the lowly status then enjoyed by noise but, arguably, by environmental pollution 
in general. 
While central government seemed to accord fairly low priority to the subject of 
noise pollution, it was not completely ignored. Indeed, noise was deemed sufficiently 
important for the government to set up a special expert group to investigate the 
subject. The remit of the Wilson Committee, which was appointed in 1960, was 
‘to examine the nature, sources and effects of the problem of noise and to advise 
what further measures can be taken to mitigate it’. The report8
 was somewhat bland 
and made some recommendations about minor changes in the law. Of importance 
was the fact that the committee was sanguine about the retention of the concept 
of nuisance as the principal instrument of the control of noise. Whilst the cynic 
of the present day can indeed quite easily cast a jaundiced eye at the report for 
its conservatism, the report did make some important recommendations about 
the practical measures which could be adopted to combat noise, especially from 
industrial and commercial premises. Indeed, BS 4142, which is used as a guide to 
predict potential noise nuisance from such premises owes its origin to the Wilson 
Report.
6 The celebrated case of Kruse v Johnson [1898] 2 QB 91 centred on the legality of a byelaw that forbade 
the playing of musical instruments, etc. in certain circumstances.

Introduction
The 1970s witnessed a growing awareness of the effects of pollution, in general, on 
the environment. There seemed also to be a distinct awareness by central government 
that a more holistic approach to environmental control was required. This resulted 
in the passage of the passage of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 (COPA), which 
was, indeed, revolutionary in its approach to environmental control. As far as noise 
was concerned, COPA continued to employ the concept of nuisance as a means 
of supressing environmental noise. However, Part III of COPA, which dealt with 
noise abatement zones (NAZs),9
 offered something more innovatory by way of noise 
pollution control. The purpose of a NAZ was to prevent so-called ‘creeping noise’, 
that is to say, noise that gradually increased in volume over a period of time.10 It is 
important to observe that the concept of nuisance was redundant in the NAZ regime. 
However, local authorities did not embrace NAZs with much enthusiasm. Indeed, 
in Scotland no NAZs were established. About eighty-six NAZs were established in 
England and Wales.11 The reason (which is based on scanty anecdotal evidence) for 
such reticence on the part of local authorities, was that they feared that the expense 
of setting up and monitoring a NAZ would far outweigh any public benefit that 
would accrue from the existence of a NAZ. In short, the concept of the NAZ, while 
theoretically beneficial, was simply unsustainable.
The 1980s witnessed a growing awareness that environmental noise was becoming 
worse.12 The government responded by setting up a working party,13 whose remit was 
to consider aspects of noise controls with particular reference to COPA. The working 
party, in effect, examined the efficacy of the principal instruments which were being 
employed in the UK at the time to control noise. The working party was supportive 
about retaining nuisance as the main instrument of noise control, as far as local 
authority responsibility for noise was concerned.14 However, the working party did 
recommend making the creation of a noise nuisance an offence of strict liability.15
The crude response to the report of the working party (the Batho Report), which 
9 The sections of Part III of COPA dealing with noise abatement zones have now been repealed. 10 Under Part III of COPA the relevant local authority would measure noise emanating from premises 
in the relevant noise abatement zone and then enter that figure in a noise register. After the relevant 
figure was entered, the occupier of the premises was placed under an obligation not to allow the 
noise from the premises to exceed that figure. It was an offence for the occupier to allow noise from 
the premises to do so. Whereas COPA permitted a local authority to include premises of any nature 
and size in a NAZ, the government intended that a NAZ be restricted to industrial/residential or 
commercial/residential areas. 11 In 2012 only two NAZs were in active use: Abolishing Noise Abatement Zones (DEFRA, 7 December 
2012). 12 The Secretary of State for the Environment, in an answer to a parliamentary question, stated that 
complaints about noise had doubled during the 1980s: HC Deb,18 October 1990 Vol 177 cols 878–
881. 13 See Noise Review Working Party Report (1990). The working party was chaired by Batho, W. It 
included representatives of local government, industry and voluntary bodies. 14 This finding was supported by the findings of a National Society for Clean Air (NSCA) survey where 
only 18 per cent of local authorities in England and Wales considered that nuisance was no longer an 
appropriate standard to use: see the NSCA survey 1998, p 14. The NSCA survey 1999 (p 12) revealed 
that only 13 per cent of local authorities considered that nuisance was no longer an appropriate 
standard. 15 Under Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 a local authority is obliged to serve an 
abatement notice on the author of a nuisance. However, an offence is committed only if the terms of 
the relevant notice are flouted.NOISE AND NOISE LAW

had drawn attention to the problem, was the passing of the Noise and Statutory 
Nuisance Act 1993, which gave local authorities inter alia power to deal with noise 
from burglar alarms and loudspeakers in streets or roads.
The 1990s experienced a rapid increase in the number of noise complaints to 
local authorities in relation to neighbourhood noise. The main problem stemmed 
from noise from hi-fi equipment, house parties and the like.16 The legislative response 
to this perceived problem was the passage of the Noise Act 1996, which, inter alia, 
made the creation of noise an offence if it exceeded a given limit at night.17 The 
Act introduced for the first time an objective standard against which noise could 
be measured. The Act, for some reason, was confined to England and Wales. The 
outstanding feature of the statute was that it eschewed the concept of nuisance and 
relied, rather, on fixed standards.
The twenty-first century
The late 1990s and early twenty-first century witnessed neighbourhood noise being 
viewed as part of a wider problem of antisocial behaviour, in general, rather than as a 
stand-alone problem. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 allowed a local authority to 
lodge a complaint before a magistrates’ court if the former believed that any person 
had acted in an antisocial manner, that is to say, in a manner that caused, or was likely 
to cause, harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons, not being of the same 
household as themselves. Noise was, therefore, clearly included in the definition of 
‘antisocial’. The Act also allowed, inter alia, the court to make antisocial behaviour 
orders (ASBOs).18 As far as Scotland was concerned, in its Partnership for a Better 
Scotland19 the Scottish Government committed itself to social justice to ensure that 
everyone in Scotland could enjoy a decent quality of life. In particular, the creation 
of excessive neighbourhood noise was to be regarded as antisocial and, therefore, was 
required to be dealt with, in conjunction with other forms of antisocial conduct. The 
Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 (ABSA) makes provision for various 
forms of antisocial behaviour, amongst which is noise. Part 2 of the ABSA allows 
a sheriff (on the application of a relevant local authority), if they are satisfied that 
certain conditions are met, to make an ASBO. The provisions of Part 5 of the ABSA, 
which are adoptive in nature (that is to say, that the provisions of ABSA applied 
only if the relevant local authority so resolves) are roughly similar to those which are 
contained in the Noise Act 1996. 
The Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 201420 contains a variety 
of provisions which are aimed at surpressing various forms of antisocial behaviour, 
including the power of an authorised person to issue community protection notices 
on an individual aged sixteen or over, or a body, if the authorised person is satisfied 
that the conduct of the individual, or body, is having a detrimental effect of a

cent of respondents to the NSCA study: see p 7. 17 The Noise Act 1996 was originally introduced in the House of Commons as a private member’s Bill by 
H. Greenway, MP. 18 The ASBO provisions of the 1998 Act were repealed by the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing

Introduction
persistent or continuing nature on the quality of life of those living in the locality 
and that the conduct is unreasonable. 
Whereas neither the UK Government, nor any of the devolved nations, has 
prepared a noise strategy outlining the direction that noise policy should take in 
the respective jurisdiction, in 2010 the UK Government published a Noise Policy 
Statement for England (NPSE).21 The purported object of the NPSE was to ‘provide 
clarity regarding current policies and practices to enable noise management decisions 
to be made within the wider context’. The NPSE set out a long-term vision for UK 
noise policy. That was to promote good health and a good quality of life through 
the effective management of noise, within the context of government policy on 
sustainable development. The NPSE set out three aims. The first was to avoid 
significant adverse effects on health and the quality of life from environmental, 
neighbour and neighbourhood noise, within the context of government policy on 
sustainable development. The second was to mitigate the adverse effects of such noise; 
and the third was, where possible, to contribute to the improvement of health and 
the quality of life through the effective management and control of environmental, 
neighbour and neighbourhood noise, within the context of government policy on 
sustainable development.
EU NOISE POLICY
No discussion of the development of noise in the UK would be complete without 
reference to the contribution of the EU.22 The development of European noise policy 
was slow and, indeed, unimaginative. The earliest measures that were used by the EU 
to deal with noise were harmonisation measures that were aimed at specific products, 
such as vehicles, in order to eliminate barriers to trade and also to facilitate the 
free movement of goods within the EU. Ostensibly, at least, there was no EU noise 
policy. However, a change in direction was seen in the EU’s Fifth Environmental 
Action Programme,23 which dealt with the problem of urban noise. It was recognised 
that noise had a negative impact on human health. Under this programme a general 
environmental objective was established, to the effect that no person should be 
exposed to noise levels that endangered life and the quality of life. The next major 
development in EU noise policy was contained in the EC Green Paper Future 
Noise Policy,
24 which was published in 1996. Importantly, a major driving force, as 
far as such policy was concerned, was the impact of noise on human health. The 
Commission accepted the view that whereas the impact of noise is, essentially, a 
local responsibility and, therefore, best dealt with by Member States themselves, the 
21 Noise Policy Statement for England, http://www.defra.gov.uk, March 2010 (last accessed 4  October 
2022). 22 For a general discussion of the development of EU law and policy in the from the 1960s until the 
1990s, see F. McManus and T. Burns, ‘The Impact of EC Law on Noise Law in the United Kingdom’ 
in J Holder (ed), The Impact of EC Law in the United Kingdom (Wiley, 1997) at 183. For a general 
discussion of the development of EU law and its impact on the UK see F. McManus ‘Noise Pollution’,

sources of noise pollution were best dealt with at EU level. Importantly, the Green 
Paper recognised that the lack of available data on noise was having a detrimental 
effect on the formulation of a coherent noise policy. The proposal for a Sixth 
Environmental Action Programme, which was published in 2001,25 recognised that 
noise pollution affected both the health and the quality of life of at least 25 per 
cent of the EU population. The Action Programme set targets for the systematic 
reduction of the numbers of those who were affected by noise. The policy, which was 
embedded in the Action Programme, found expression in the EU Environmental 
Noise Directive (the END) relating to the assessment and management of noise.26
The END Directive represents the most important measure the EU has taken, thus 
far, in battle against ambient noise. Indeed, the END represents the flagship of the 
EU’s efforts to reduce ambient noise.
The END’s main objective is to establish a common EU framework for the 
assessment and management of exposure to environmental noise27 by using common 
methods of noise measurement and, furthermore, and importantly, ensuring that 
such information is made available to the public.28 The END focuses mainly on 
transportation noise (rail, traffic, aircraft) and industrial noise. However, the END 
does not set limit values (i.e. noise levels that must not be exceeded) in any area. 
This is left to the discretion of the Member State. Thus, the principal of subsidiarity, 
which is engrained in EU law, is upheld.
The scope of the END is wide-ranging and it applies to environmental noise 
to which humans are exposed, particularly in built-up areas, in public parks or 
other quiet areas in an agglomeration,29 in quiet areas in open country, and near 
schools, hospitals and other noise-sensitive buildings and areas.30 However, the 
END does not apply to noise that is caused by the exposed person themselves, noise 
from domestic activities, noise created by neighbours, noise at workplaces, noise 
inside means of transport or noise that is caused by military activities in military 
areas. Overall responsibility for implementing the END lay with Member States 
who were required to designate competent authorities and bodies responsible for 
implementing the END.31 Member States were required32 to ensure that action plans 
which are designed to manage within the relevant territory, noise issues and effects, 
including noise reduction, were drawn up by the relevant competent authorities.33 The 
END lays down minimum requirements as far as action plans are concerned.34
25 European Commission, COM (2001) 31 January 2001. 26 Directive 2002/49/EC. 27 ‘Environmental noise’ is defined as unwanted or harmful outdoor sound created by human activities, 
including noise emitted by means of transport, road traffic, air traffic and from sites of industrial activity 
such as those defined in Annex I to Council Directive 96/61/EC of 24 September 1996 concerning 
integrated pollution prevention and control. 28 Directive 2002/49/EC art 1. 29 An agglomeration is defined as ‘part of a territory, delimited by the Member State having a population 
in excess of 100,000 persons and a population density such that the Member State considers it to be 
an urbanised area’: Directive 2002/49/EC art 3. 30 Directive 2002/49/EC art 2. 31 Directive 2002/49/EC art 4. 32 By 18 July 2008. 33 Directive 2002/49/EC art 8. 34 Directive 2002/49/EC Annex V.7
Introduction
A fundamental problem that has been associated with noise pollution, whether 
it takes the form either of ambient or neighbourhood noise, is that the public are 
generally unaware of both the nature and also the levels of noise that affect their 
locality. Such a general lack of insight into the problem has profoundly affected 
the accountability of local authorities who are charged with the responsibility of 
implementing the law relating to noise.35 The END attempts to address at least some 
of the problem by requiring Member States to ensure that both strategic noise 
maps36 and also action plans, are made available and also disseminated to members 
of the public.37 Importantly, the information requires to be clear, comprehensible 
and accessible. Furthermore, a summary, which sets out the most important points, 
requires to be provided.
No introduction to noise law and policy would be complete without making 
brief reference to the implications of Brexit. The UK’s leaving the EU, which has had 
a profound effect in the shaping of UK environmental law, especially in relation to 
water, air pollution and waste, certainly leaves a legislative gap. It would indeed take 
the foresight of a Hebrew prophet to predict the direction the law will take in the wake 
of Brexit. In this context, reference must, of course, be made to the Environment Act 
2021 that has been recently passed by Parliament. The Act, inter alia, makes provision 
for targets, plans and policies for improving the natural environment. Under s 1(1) a 
duty is placed on the Secretary of State to set long-term targets for any matter which 
relates to the natural environment, or people’s enjoyment of the natural environment. 
In turn, under s 8(1) the Secretary of State is required to prepare an environmental 
improvement plan, which is defined in s 8(2) as a plan for significantly improving 
the natural environment. Under s 44 the expression ‘natural environment’ includes 
‘air’. In turn, s 45 defines, ‘environmental protection’, inter alia, as protection of the 
natural environment from the effects of human activity. Such activity, of course, could 
include the generation of environmental noise, through the medium of air. Under 
s 17(1) and (2) the Secretary of State is under a duty to prepare a policy statement 
on environmental principles, that is to say, how such principles should be interpreted 
and proportionately applied by ministers of the Crown when making policy. Under 
s 17(5) the term ‘environmental principles’ means:
(a) the principle that environmental protection should be integrated into the 
making of environmental policies;
(b) the principle of preventative action to avert environmental damage;
(c) the precautionary principle so far as relating to the environment; and
(d) the principle that environmental damage should as a priority, be rectified at 
source; and
(e) the polluter pays principle.
It will be interesting to observe the extent, if any, to which noise will feature in any 
such targets or plans in the future. Will the Act elevate the importance of noise on 
the political agenda?
35 See F. McManus, ‘Noise law in the United Kingdom – a very British solution’ (2000) 20 LS 264 at 282. 36 A strategic noise map means a map that is designated for the global assessment of noise exposure in a 
given area due to noise sources or for overall predications of such an area: Directive 2002/49/EC art 3. 37 Directive 2002/49/EC art 9(1).NOISE AND NOISE LAW

Chapters 2 and 3 of Noise and Noise Law provide the reader with an overview 
of the scientific background to noise, with special reference to the practitioner. The 
book then goes on to discuss both the common law and statutory controls over noise. 
Finally, as stated in the preface, the environment is a devolved function in the UK. 
The central authority of each nation is, therefore, responsible for formulating noise 
policy within its jurisdiction.9
Chapter 2
Basic Acoustics and Human Sound 
Perception
INTRODUCTION
This chapter introduces some important factors in the understanding of sound, sound 
propagation and transmission, and sound perception without, as far as possible, any 
maths or complex scientific descriptions. There are plenty of text books available that 
do include this greater level of detail, but this chapter, and the one that follows it, are 
intended as a general introduction to those who may need a working knowledge of 
some of the concepts involved and, in particular, how they may affect legal arguments 
and the formulation of legal cases.
It outlines the objective concepts that are used to describe sound, together with 
a brief introduction to the way sound is perceived and how it can lead to annoyance 
and, possibly, nuisance. 
It is important that any legal considerations are properly informed by reference 
to objective measurement and assessment, in order that any decision-makers can 
properly take them into consideration and that those presenting the arguments, on 
both sides, understand the work of the expert witnesses, on both sides, and their 
reports. 
BASIC ACOUSTICS
Sound pressure level 
Sound is, essentially, rapidly fluctuating pressure above and below the resting pressure 
of the atmosphere. The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is just over 100,000 
Pascals; Pascals being the international standard (SI) unit of pressure. The lowest 
pressure fluctuations that can be detected by the ear are around five billion times less 
at 20 micro-Pascals. As the pressure fluctuations increase, the corresponding sound 
gets louder, up to the point where it becomes physically uncomfortable to listen to, 
which occurs at a fluctuation level of around 20 pascals where physical damage to the 
hearing mechanism can occur. 
It can readily be seen that representing the magnitude of the sound using the 
physical attributes of the pressure signal, as it oscillates above and below atmospheric 
pressure, is unwieldy. It needs to be quantified in such a way that an unchanging level 
of sound can be quantified with a single unchanging number. Additionally, because 
the loudest sounds of interest are approximately one million times greater than the 
quietest, in the 1930s the magnitude of sound began to be expressed in terms of 
2 Basic Acoustics and Human Sound PerceptionNOISE AND NOISE LAW
10
the ratio of the average pressure level of the sound of interest over a very short 
period (see ‘time weightings’ in Chapter 2) to a reference level of 20 micro-pascals; 
the results of this ratio being expressed as a logarithmic value, multiplied by 20 to 
provide a convenient scale for use in measurements and assessments. This is the basis 
of the decibel (dB) scale which is used ubiquitously today to quantify ‘sound pressure 
level ’, which forms the basic unit of sound although, in practice, it is not a unit but 
a ratio. 
The reference level used in the decibel calculation, of 20 micro-pascals, equates to 
0 dB, with the corresponding threshold of pain occurring at a level of around 140 dB. 
This 0–140 dB is the approximate ‘dynamic range’ available to healthy human ears 
(i.e. between sounds that can only just be heard, to those which cause pain). 
Sound power level
Sound pressure level should not be confused with sound power level, as they are 
entirely different concepts. It is almost inevitable that confusion arises because 
both are expressed in dB and both relate to sound. However, just as sound pressure 
level is the ratio of the pressure fluctuations received at the measurement point to a 
reference pressure, expressed as a logarithmic value as described above, sound power 
level is the ratio of the acoustic power of the source, in watts (the unit of power), 
to a reference power of 10−12 watts, also with the results expressed as a logarithmic 
value.
Figure 2.1 The Decibel Scale 11
Basic Acoustics and Human Sound Perception
Broadly speaking, if a ‘sound level’ is quoted with no reference to the location, or 
the distance, at which it was measured, then, to have any meaning it must be assumed 
that it is a sound power level. 
Frequency or pitch
The rate of fluctuation of the air pressure producing the sound gives the sound its 
apparent pitch. A slower rate of variation causes the perception of a lower pitched 
sound and, correspondingly, a faster rate of variation causes the perception of a 
higher pitched sound. This rate of variation is referred to as the frequency of the 
sound and it is measured in pressure cycles per second or Hertz (Hz). The human ear 
is less sensitive to sounds at high and low frequencies than to sounds in the middle 
of the hearing range, which results in low and high frequency sounds appearing to be 
quieter at the same sound pressure level. This change in sensitivity with frequency is 
referred to as the ‘frequency response’ of the ear, which is most sensitive to sounds at 
the frequencies corresponding to the weaker sounds of speech known as the ‘unvoiced 
fricatives’ (‘f ’, ‘s’ and ‘th’, for example), probably to do with the evolution of speech 
communication, This most sensitive part of the hearing range covers frequencies just 
above the middle of the audible range of frequencies where the hearing threshold 
(the quietest sounds that can be heard at that frequency) is actually lower than the 
0 dB reference level, referred to above, at about −10 dB. 
Apart from some musical sounds, sounds from various specific mechanical 
sources and those produced for scientific or analytical purposes, such as hearing tests, 
most sounds are made up of many different frequencies. Most sounds, particularly 
those in the general environment, are quantified in terms of their dB(A) or dBA 
value, which means that an ‘A-weighting curve’ is applied to the measurement device 
(usually a ‘sound level meter’). This compensates for the frequency response of the 
ear, discussed above, by applying reduction in measured level to sounds of lower 
and higher frequency than those in the middle of the hearing range. This will be 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 3, which addresses the way sound is measured 
and assessed, rather than on the way it behaves and the way it is perceived, which is 
the purpose of this chapter. 
Sound propagation
Sound is produced by anything that vibrates in the surrounding atmosphere, causing 
fluctuating air pressure in its immediate vicinity, which is then transmitted by, and 
through, the atmosphere to the receiver (normally the ear), rather akin to ripples 
on an otherwise still pond surface. For a single small sound source (a ‘point source’) 
in free space (i.e. with no reflections), the distance to the receiver causes the sound 
pressure level to reduce (or ‘attenuate’) by 6 dB every time the distance from the 
source doubles. Where the source of sound is large compared to the distance to the 
receiver, this rate of decrease no longer applies. A good example of this is for traffic 
on a busy road where distance causes the sound pressure level to decay at a reduced 
rate of 3 dB per doubling of distance from the road instead of the standard 6 dB 
discussed above. 
In practice, there are other factors that need to be taken into account, including 
attenuation by the atmosphere, which is more significant for high frequency sound NOISE AND NOISE LAW
12
than low frequency sound, hence why low bass notes from a music venue may appear 
to travel further than other music noise. Other factors that can be significant are the 
effects of sound reflections, which can increase the received sound pressure level and 
physical barriers between the source and the receiver, which normally reduce it and 
which, as with atmospheric attenuation, reduce low frequency sound more than high 
frequency sound. 
SOUND INSIDE A BUILDING AND SOUND TRANSMISSION 
Sound inside a building behaves very differently to sound outside, and the effect of 
reflections become much more important. In fact, when we are inside, our ears tend 
to receive more reflected sound, due to the build-up of reflections from the room 
surfaces, than direct sound. In practice, this depends on how absorbent the surfaces 
of walls, ceilings and floors are, with harder surfaces causing stronger reflections. In a 
very big room or building, the first reflections are perceived as echoes due to the time 
it takes for the sounds to be reflected from more distant surfaces. The effect of the 
combined delay and strength of these echoes are referred to as the reverberation time
of the space. A shorter reverberation time can be more conducive to understanding 
speech because of the lack of overlap of the individual elements thereof, whereas a 
longer reverberation time can make music sound fuller and more pleasant to listen 
to. It can even improve speech to a certain degree, because it has the effect of making 
it sound louder due to the combination of all the reflections, so a balance has to be 
found whereby acoustical engineers install different levels of absorption, depending 
on the purposes of the space.
The extent to which sound is transmitted between different rooms in the same 
building is crucial to residential amenity, especially where it occurs between different 
residential units, such as within blocks of flats. For a given sound source, the amount 
of sound that is transmitted depends on the reverberation time of the room containing 
it, that of the room in which the receiver is situated, and the construction of the 
building elements (walls and ceilings/floors) separating them. Generally speaking, 
the sound-reducing capability of such elements depends on their weight. Therefore, 
a brick wall will be much more effective in reducing sound than a plasterboard wall 
(a wooden structure faced with plasterboard on both sides). Although absorbent 
material, which has no sound reduction properties itself, is usually included between 
the two plasterboard ‘skins’, this is to prevent the build-up of reflections within the 
structure and improve its overall performance. 
As well as travelling through the air, sound can also be transmitted by the solid 
elements of the structure. In addition to insulation, isolation in the form of ‘flexible’ 
joints, such as rubber, between building elements may also be necessary to prevent 
such structural transmission and to reduce airborne transmission between two 
spaces. This would apply to, say, footsteps in a first floor flat being transmitted by 
the building structure and re-radiated as sound within a ground floor flat. However, 
sound in a room, as well as direct vibration, can also be transmitted to another one 
by the structure. 
As well as sound transmission between rooms, or other acoustic spaces, sound 
transmission from outside to inside a building, and vice versa, can be equally as 
important although, in this case, it is usually the windows that are the acoustically-13
Basic Acoustics and Human Sound Perception
weakest points. Sound transmission through a roof/ceiling can also be significant, 
as this tends to allow more sound transmission than standard cavity walls. The 
amount of sound reduction afforded by standard double glazing is quite significant, 
although the seals, particularly around opening windows are critical for optimising 
performance. Improved acoustic performance is achieved by increasing the weight 
of the glass in the panes and the separation distance between them. For critical 
applications, further improvements can be made by using different thickness of glass 
in two isolated panes that are slightly off-parallel.
As for barriers and atmospheric attenuation, sound transmission between rooms 
and from outside to inside, and vice versa, is greater for lower frequency sounds than 
for those of higher frequency, so the amount and type of insulation required will vary, 
depending on the nature of the sound.
THE HEARING MECHANISM
Sounds arriving at our ears, as pressure variations, travel down the external ear canal 
and cause the eardrum to vibrate. This section of the hearing mechanism is referred 
to as the ‘outer ear’. The vibrations of the ear drum are then transmitted by the small 
bones of the ‘middle ear’ (the smallest bones in the human body) to the ‘inner ear’, 
which comprises the ‘cochlea’, the organ of hearing, and the ‘semi-circular canals’, 
the organ of balance. 
The middle ear is connected to the back of the throat by the ‘eustachian tube’, 
which is normally closed to protect the middle ear from infection. It opens, however, 
when we yawn or swallow partly in order to ventilate the middle ear, which, apart 
from the bones, is an air-filled cavity, but also, and more importantly, to equalise the 
pressure in the cavity with that in the external ear canal. If the pressure is not equal, 
it results in slight temporary deafness or even pain due to difference in pressures 
pushing or pulling the eardrum outside its normal operating position. This pressure 
difference normally results from relatively sudden changes in height, such as when 
an aircraft takes off or lands, and the eustachian tube fails to open as required. The 
ability of the tube to open can be hampered by excessive secretions in the middle ear, 
which normally pass down the tube, such as might occur with a common cold. The 
resulting delay in pressure equalisation can cause extended pain and deafness. This is 
why children’s eardrums are sometimes fitted with ‘grommets’, which are tiny tubes 
inserted into the ear drum to keep the pressure on either side permanently equalised, 
improving hearing and reducing pain during childhood and which fall out in due 
course. The three bones of the middle ear form a system of levers that transfer the 
relatively large but weak movements of the eardrum to the cochlea which requires 
smaller, higher strength, movements to stimulate the fluid system it contains. These 
levers are controlled to an extent by the brain such that, for sudden loud sounds, they 
change the way in which they operate to reduce the signals entering the inner ear. 
This is referred to as the ‘acoustic reflex’.
It is not proposed to discuss the functioning of the semi-circular canals, which 
constantly monitor our head’s position and any movements it makes, enabling us to 
balance, except to note that they are connected to the cochlea, the other component 
of the inner ear, and shares the fluid with part of the cochlea. The cochlea itself 
is a spiral tube of about 30 mm in length that contains three separate fluid-filled NOISE AND NOISE LAW
14
tubes, or ‘ducts’. One of these, the vestibular duct, has a small opening covered with a 
membrane (the ‘oval window’) in which the third and smallest bone of the middle ear, 
the ‘stapes’, is positioned to transmit the vibrations of the eardrum into the cochlea. 
These vibrations, which travel along the ‘vestibular duct’ from the oval window and 
back down the ‘tympanic duct’ to the ‘round window’, a similar opening, cause hairs 
on cells in the middle duct, which separates the other two, to move. As they move, 
these cells (the ‘hair cells’) transmit signals to the brain in line with the vibrations of 
the hairs of the cells that, in turn, depend on the vibration in the fluid as stimulated 
by the movement of the stapes. There are four rows of hair cells consisting of 3,500 
hairs in an inner row, which send signals along the auditory nerve to the brain, and a 
further 12,000 in three outer rows which receive signals back from the brain, as part 
of an internal feedback system that improves on the cochlea’s mechanical inherent 
electro-mechanical properties to enable it to respond more accurately to the very 
complex signals it receives, and to translate them into the electrical impulses the 
brain needs to process them.
When the hearing mechanism goes wrong, causing hearing loss, it can result 
from problems in either the outer and middle ear, referred to as ‘conductive hearing 
loss’; or in the inner ear or auditory nerve, referred to as ‘sensori-neural hearing loss’. 
Conductive hearing loss can result from a blockage, damage to the eardrum or 
damage to, or malfunction of, the middle ear bones. Sensori-neural hearing loss 
results from damage to the hair cells due to genetic issues, infection, high levels of 
noise exposure or from the ageing process. In the case of one-sided hearing loss, it 
could be indicative of a possible tumour on the auditory nerve. The big difference 
between the two types of hearing loss is that conductive hearing loss reduces the 
level of all sounds, albeit by different amounts, depending on frequency, whereas 
sensori-neural hearing loss means that quiet sounds are no longer audible. However, 
loud sounds are audible at normal levels, thus reducing the dynamic range of the ear. 
Figure 2.2 The Hearing Mechanism15
Basic Acoustics and Human Sound Perception
In this respect, conductive hearing loss can be considered to be frequency-dependent 
attenuation whereas sensori-neural hearing loss is a malfunction of the mechanism 
that translates the sound into electrical signals going to the brain. This means that 
hearing aids can be quite effective for conductive hearing loss, which can be overcome 
by selective amplification at different frequencies. They are, however, much less useful 
for sensori-neural hearing loss, which requires the faulty processing mechanism to be 
compensated for in some way and this is not necessarily possible with a basic hearing 
aid. The situation can be improved to a certain extent, however, with various types 
of signal processing. which are increasingly available within commercially available 
hearing aids. 
SOUND PERCEPTION
The way sounds are perceived depends on their nature, including how loud they 
appear; the relative sound pressure levels of sounds of different frequency contained 
within the overall sound; any specific ‘acoustic features’ which are present such as 
tones (sounds of specific pitch), impulses (sudden sounds or repetitive or intermittent 
sudden changes in level); or anything else that draws attention to the sound. 
Non-acoustic factors can also be very significant in determining how we perceive 
and respond to what we hear. These factors can include the information content of 
the sound; the way we feel about the producer of the sound; the extent to which we 
have control over the sound; the time of day; the activity we are engaged in at the time 
the sound occurs; and many other social, economic and psychological considerations 
that may, in some cases, be more significant than the acoustical characteristics of the 
sound itself. The sound of road traffic noise, for instance, is generally accepted by 
people who live in urban environments but the sound of music from a neighbouring 
property, at the same sound pressure level, may well not be.
The human ear is commonly said to perceive sounds from low frequencies, from 
around 20 Hz, to high frequencies around 20,000 Hz (20 kHz) but, in fact, sounds 
outside this frequency range can also be perceived – although not necessarily as 
identifiable sound – but only if the sound pressure level is high enough. A more 
complete description is that the sensitivity of the ear gradually reduces from its most 
sensitive region around 1,000 to 4,000 Hz and this continues into the region below 
20 Hz, which is referred to as infrasound. Similar effects occur at high frequencies 
extending into the ultrasound region above 20,000 Hz. 
The threshold of pain does not change significantly with frequency, meaning that 
the ear has a much-reduced dynamic range at low and high frequencies, possibly as 
little as a few decibels at the highest and lowest ends of the frequency range, meaning 
that a sound can go from completely inaudible to very uncomfortable with a very 
small change in sound pressure level for these types of sounds.
EFFECTS OF UNWANTED SOUND 
The reader will note that the term ‘sound’ has been used up to this point rather than 
‘noise’ which, although integral to the title of this book, can be a highly emotive word 
albeit that it is widely used in legislative terminology. ‘Sound’ is the all-encompassing 
word for anything that we perceive in our brains as a result of pressure fluctuations NOISE AND NOISE LAW
16
at our ears. All noise is sound but not all sound is ‘noise’. Noise is a purely subjective 
description and was defined in the final report by the Committee on the Problem 
of Noise,1
 sometimes called the Wilson Report, as ‘sound which is undesired by the 
recipient’. This was one of the earliest reports on the effects of unwanted sound, or 
noise, in the environment, as opposed to in buildings, and it was published in 1963. 
Both noise in the environment, and in buildings can, depending on its level, cause 
interference with communication; noise-induced hearing loss; sleep disturbance of 
various types; effects on performance and activities; and annoyance. Annoyance can, 
in turn, cause stress, which may lead to sleep disturbance and other adverse health 
effects. Any combination of the factors causing annoyance can lead to a noise being 
considered to be a ‘nuisance’ in the legal sense of the word, although noise-induced 
hearing loss is not normally considered as a nuisance issue. Unlike other forms of 
noise exposure, it occurs in the workplace and has ongoing physical consequences 
that persist after exposure to the noise has ceased. 
The effects of different types of noise, as it varies with sound pressure level, is 
often quantified by ‘dose response’ curves which are based on research and show the 
way annoyance increases as sound pressure level increases. These are different for 
different sources of noise because of the difference in attitudes (the non-acoustic 
factors discussed above). This means that one source of noise may show as being 
more annoying than another at the same noise level. In addition, individual responses 
will vary significantly above and below the average response so average dose response 
curves, based on research, may be of limited value in individual cases. Such dose 
response curves can also depend on the way the noise is quantified, as this can be 
done in different ways. Specific ways of quantifying noise, over and above what can 
be done through instantaneous measurements of sound pressure level, are referred to 
as noise ‘metrics’ or ‘indices’ and are discussed further in Chapter 3. 
It is very clear that noise which is generated by identifiable individuals, such as 
neighbours, or that generated by industrial premises, is much more annoying at the 
same level, than noise that is caused by sources that are anonymous in nature, such 
as that from road traffic, as discussed in the previous section. Noise from natural 
sources, such as wild bird song, rivers and streams, waves lapping, etc. is very rarely 
a cause of annoyance and it should also, of course, be noted that what is ‘wanted 
sound’ for some people may be unwanted sound for others. This is particularly so in 
the case of music sources, but even low sound pressure level sources such as garden 
wind chimes. A very important consideration in respect of annoyance, where it is 
generated by an individual, is whether or not the noise is seen to be preventable, or 
whether it represents lack of consideration by the generator of the noise towards 
the receiver. Conversely, where the source of the noise provides some benefit to the 
recipient, such as employment or other financial benefit, annoyance will be less for 
noise at the same sound pressure level.

The Measurement and Assessment of Noise
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of this chapter is to explain how noise is quantified using a ‘sound level 
meter’ with its basic function explained and the various options that are available for 
assessing the noise in various circumstances, in order to provide objective assessments 
of noise as it affects people. In this chapter the word ‘noise’ will be used rather than 
sound, bearing in mind the commentary in the previous chapter on the fact that noise 
is essentially unwanted sound and, for the most part, this is why it is being assessed. It 
should, however, be borne in mind that unwanted sound is often heard in the context 
of ‘wanted’ sound. However, for the purposes of brevity, noise will be used, in most 
cases, to cover the measurements and assessments described in this chapter.
THE SOUND LEVEL METER
It is rather ironic, perhaps, in the context of the above, that noise measurements are 
made using a device called a ‘sound level meter’, which is used to quantify ‘sound 
pressure level’. But, of course, such an electronic device is incapable of making such a 
distinction! Sound pressure level is explained in Chapter 1 and is a way of quantifying 
a sound that is constant in level as a single number value expressed in decibels (dB). 
Basic function
A sound level meter consists of a microphone, which converts the fluctuating sound 
pressure into a fluctuating electrical signal corresponding precisely, subject to certain 
tolerances, to the pressure signal it is being used to measure. This is converted by 
electronic circuitry to a fixed voltage corresponding to the voltage fluctuations over a 
specified very short time period referred to as the ‘time-weighting’, as discussed very 
briefly under the definition of sound pressure level in Chapter 1. The specifications 
for sound level meters are very precise in respect of microphone directivity, frequency 
response and linearity (changes in noise level being accurately matched by changes in 
reported sound pressure level) and are regulated by the provisions of BS EN 61672, 
Electroacoustics – Sound Level Meters. This document provides specifications for two 
‘classes’ of meter: Class 1 and Class 2 with Class 1 meters normally being use for 
environmental noise measurements due to their superior performance.

Time-weightings and sound level meter displays 
There are three time-weightings in use; slow, fast and impulse, corresponding to 
integration times of 1 second, 125 milliseconds and 35 milliseconds respectively. In 
the past, the sound level meter display consisted of a moving needle on a scale. The 
needle moved slower or faster depending on the time weighting and a degree of 
‘eyeball’ averaging could be achieved by use of the slow weighting. With the current 
use of digital displays, the display changes too rapidly to allow such visual averaging. 
Longer term averaging
In practice, sound in the environment is only very rarely constant. The measured 
sound pressure level is, therefore, constantly varying, to a greater or lesser extent, 
depending on the sound, or combination of sounds, reaching the sound level meter. 
Because of this, the most commonly used noise measurement index, the ‘equivalent 
continuous sound level ’ (dB Leq,t), is the level of sound that, if continuous, would 
have the same acoustic energy as that fluctuating sound. This represents a way of 
quantifying the sound pressure level, as it varies with time, over a given measurement 
interval, ‘t’. Where an A-weighting, as discussed below and in Chapter 1, is applied 
by the sound level meter, the result is expressed as a dB LAeq,t value. This is discussed 
further under noise measurement indices below.
Compensating for the frequency response of the ear
As discussed in Chapter 1, the threshold of hearing for the human ear varies with 
frequency, with the ear being less sensitive at low and high frequencies. This can be 
referred to as the ‘frequency response’ of the ear at threshold and is compensated 
for by setting the sound level meter to apply the ‘A’ weighting as part of its initial 
processing of the noise signal. This is rather akin to using a graphic equaliser or other 
tone controls on audio equipment. 
The ear’s frequency response changes, however, as sounds get louder, meaning that 
the apparent difference in volume between sounds at low frequency, e.g. 50 Hz, and 
mid-frequency, e.g. 1000Hz, at the same sound pressure level, becomes less as the 
sound pressure level increases. In this way, music listened to at low volume will appear 
to have less low frequency (bass) content than at medium or high listening levels. This 
is the purpose of a loudness switch on a hi-fi amplifier, which applies a high level of 
bass boost at low volume settings and progressively reduces as volume level is increased. 
To accommodate this changing frequency response, sound level meters have also 
included other weighting settings, known as ‘frequency weightings’; B-weighting to 
approximate the ears response to mid-range sound pressure levels and C-weighting 
to approximate its response to high sound pressure levels. An additional D-weighting, 
which added a substantial peak to the response at 3,000 and 4,000 Hz, was also made 
available to replicate the human subjective response to turbojet* aircraft noise but 
neither this, nor the B-weighting, is now included in specifications for sound level 
meters.1
 The C-weighting is, however, still used, mostly so that results using this

The Measurement and Assessment of Noise
weighting can be compared with those obtained using the A-weighting in order to 
provide an indication of the relative amount of low frequency content in the noise in 
the absence of more detailed (frequency specific) measurements that will be covered 
later in this chapter. It can also be used as an approximation to a linear response (i.e. 
with no weighting) to evaluate ‘peak’ sound level, for example, for the purposes of the 
Noise at Work Regulations.2
 The peak sound level is the maximum sound pressure 
generated by a sound source over a given time period without any ‘time-weighting’ 
(see earlier) being applied. It is quite distinct from the maximum sound pressure level 
over the same time period, which would have a different value depending on the 
time-weighting applied to the integration process used to quantify it. 
There are two further frequency weightings in use, consisting of the G-weighting 
and the Z-weighting. The G-weighting is intended to approximate the human ear’s 
response to sound pressure levels below 20  Hz, which is sometimes, erroneously, 
considered to be the lower bound of human hearing (see Chapter 1). By using this 
weighting, the significance of noise in the sub-20 Hz region can be evaluated without 
reference to the specific frequency at which it occurs. The resultant G-weighted 
result will show the level of the noise in relation to the threshold of perception that 
is normally considered to be at a level of 85 dB(G). The Z-weighting approximates 
a linear weighting but allows for the fact that standard noise measurement 
instrumentation is unlikely to be able to provide a linear response below 10 Hz or 
above 20 kHz so instead it specifies a linear response between these two values.

QUANTIFICATION OF VARYING NOISE LEVEL
dB/dB(A) and maximum and minimum levels
As previously discussed, the basic noise measurement index is the decibel (dB), more 
usually the A-weighted decibel  dB(A). However, for most purposes, as discussed 
above, this value is constantly changing in response to the changes in the noise 
environment being measured. This variation is obvious for passing traffic, trains and 
over-flying aircraft. But even noise sources that are relatively steady, for example 
from industry or construction; general noise in the environment (usually distant road 
traffic); other sound of human origin; or natural sounds, are constantly varying. This 
means that, in most cases, a simple dB or dB(A) reading of the instantaneous noise 
level every 125 milliseconds or 1 second (see time weightings (above)) cannot be 
used to quantify the noise environment except, possibly to indicate the range from 
the minimum (Lmin or LAmin) to the maximum noise level (Lmax or LAmax) over a given 
time period. 
Equivalent continuous sound level (Leq) 
Because of the limitations in assessing a rapidly varying noise level in overall terms, a 
number of other measurement indices are available and implemented on sound level 
meters in order to provide further quantification of the noise environment as it varies 
over a specified time period, ‘t’. The most commonly used of these is the equivalent 
continuous sound pressure level, measured in  dB Leq,t, or  dB LAeq,t,  dB LCeq,t, etc. 
where the signal is frequency weighted using the A or C weighting. A common time 
period for assessment would be one hour (LAeq, 1hr), such as is used for construction 
noise (see BS 52283
) and daytime industrial/commercial noise,4
 although shorter or 
longer periods may be specified for other specific purposes. For instance, ten minutes 
is used for wind turbine noise, which varies with wind speed, with both of these 
being measured over the same time period. In this instance, however, it is the LA90
value, as discussed under statistical noise indices (below), which is used rather than 
LAeq. This is discussed further under ETSU-R-975
 in the final section of this chapter. 
Noise in the workplace is evaluated over a whole working day2
 and aircraft noise over 
a sixteen hour day.* 
For the purposes of sleep disturbance, the World Health Organisation (WHO) 
refers to the external night-time LAeq over a whole year quantified as Lnight,
6
 although 
it is more likely such values would be derived through sampled noise level over 
shorter periods and/or predictions rather than through actual measurement over a 
whole year.

The Measurement and Assessment of Noise
Other indices based on LAeq
The day-evening-night noise level (Lden), as referred to in the European Environmental 
Noise Directive7
 is similar to the Lnight as used in the WHO Night Noise Guidelines 
for Europe, insofar as it considers noise over a whole year, but the Lden considers noise 
from all periods of the day by calculating the daytime (7am–7pm) LAeq, the evening 
period (1900–2300) LAeq and the night-time (11pm–7am) LAeq over a whole year, 
adding 5 dB to the evening level and 10 dB to the night-time level. This allows for 
the increased sensitivity to noise during these periods. This should not be confused 
with the day-night noise level Ldn, used in the USA, which treats the evening period 
the same as for the daytime. 
One further LAeq-based noise measurement index of note is the sound exposure 
level (SEL or sometimes LAE). This also used to be known as the single event level, 
which is a better description of what it is, which is an LAeq noise measurement over 
the duration of an event, normalised to a period of one second; effectively the sound 
energy level of an individual event. Where an LAeq measurement is made of a single 
event, the LAeq value will depend on how long the measurement is set to run on 
either side of the event taking place. By normalising the result to one second, the 
measurement duration is no longer significant as long as it captures the whole of 
the event and the results can be compared with similar measurements with different 
measurement durations. 
Statistical indices (Ln)
An alternative to Leq for assessing noise level, L, over a period of time, is to evaluate 
the noise level that is exceeded for a given percentage (N) of the measurement period 
(LN, or LAN when ‘A’ weighted). Common examples of this are the LA90, which is used 
to quantify ‘background noise level ’ in British Standard BS 4142,4
 and LA10, which 
is used for traffic noise predictions pertaining, inter alia, to the Noise Insulation 
Regulations. LA01 and LA99 can be used as surrogates for LAmax and LAmin with LA50 also 
substituting for LAeq because all of these have the advantage of giving less weight to 
atypical or unusual events or circumstances. One further index that is worth noting is 
the Nx
 index, used for aircraft noise assessment, which refers to the number of ‘events’ 
that exceed a specific (A-weighted) decibel level, X. 
It should be noted that the indices referred to above do not comprise a complete 
list and other indices have been, and are currently, used for specific purposes and by 
different regulatory bodies as required. 
ASSESSING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF TONES IN THE NOISE 
(FREQUENCY ANALYSIS)
It may be noted that all of the above deal with overall noise levels, albeit weighted 
according to the frequency response of the ear or other weighting. Far more precision, 
in terms of perceptibility, can be achieved by dividing the measured noise levels into 
different ‘frequency bands’ using electronic filters either in the sound level meter or, 
7 EU Directive 2002/49/EC, The Assessment and Management of Environmental Noise.NOISE AND NOISE LAW
22
for post-processing of audio data recorded by it, on a separate recording device. The 
simplest of these are low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters wherein only sounds 
below a certain frequency, above a certain frequency or between two frequencies, 
are included in the results of measurements. Noise measurements can also be made 
using a series of band-pass filters operating in tandem. These can be ‘octave’ bands 
based in such a way that each band is centred on a frequency that is twice that of the 
one below; i.e. 125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, etc. 1/3 octave bands where there are three 
bands to each octave; i.e. 100 Hz, 125 Hz, 160 Hz, 200 Hz, 250 Hz, 315 Hz, etc. or 
narrower bands (1/12 octave, 1/24 octave), which can give more precise information 
on specific features in the noise. These are referred to as ‘constant percentage’ filters 
where the high bands cover a greater number of frequencies than lower bands.
An alternative to band-pass filtering for frequency analysis is the use of a 
mathematical algorithm called a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), implemented 
digitally within some sophisticated sound level meters, usually referred to as noise 
analysers or similar. This is referred to as ‘constant bandwidth’ filtering where higher 
bands and lower bands cover the same number of frequencies. 
ASSESSING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF VARIATION IN THE NOISE 
LEVEL (TEMPORAL ANALYSIS)
Temporal analysis is what is required where the variation in noise level is of particular 
importance and provides much more detailed information than is available from an 
examination of the maximum, minimum, LAeq and the various statistical indices (see 
Figure 3.2). It can also be used to show when various noise ‘events’ start and stop, 
and their level. Noise levels can be shown as they vary over any particular period of 
interest and are often displayed in terms of the variation of ‘short’ LAeq values. These

short LAeq values could each have a duration of as little as 100 milliseconds in order 
to show as precise detail as possible, although one 1 second values may be more 
practicable for most purposes and could be used, for instance, to show the variation 
in noise over an hour of operation of an industrial, commercial or construction 
site.
This kind of analysis can, if necessary, be combined with frequency analysis 
wherein the variation in noise level can be evaluated over a specific frequency range

in a ‘waterfall plot’ showing the variation in noise level over time with different 
frequencies shown with different colours.
ACOUSTIC FEATURES
Subjective response to noise can be greater for a noise that has specific ‘acoustic 
features’, such as tones (sounds of specific pitch), impulses (sudden sounds or 
repetitive or intermittent sudden changes in level) or anything else that highlights 
it in the listener’s attention, than it would be for a noise at a similar level with none 
of these features. 
It is, therefore, important that, where necessary, measurements are carried out 
in such a way that appropriate data is available to allow the measured overall noise 
level to be supplemented, by consideration of such features. This may consist of the 
addition of a penalty/correction to the measured overall noise level to account for 
such features in subsequent assessment. The inclusion of an assessment of tonal noise 
would normally require, as a minimum, 1/3 octave band analysis to show whether 
a correction should be included in the measured noise level to account for this 
factor but, more usually, this would require narrow band analysis of either constant 
percentage or constant frequency bandwidth to allow the significance of any tones 
to be determined.
Likewise, impulsive noise, or even noise with a regular modulation or other such 
factor drawing attention to it, would require temporal analysis, showing the variation 
of noise, possibly band limited as necessary, with time, to determine its potential 
significance to a noise complaint or other investigation. 
NOISE ASSESSMENT
Absolute or relative level assessment
The precise way a noise assessment is carried out will inevitably depend on the 
noise that is being assessed and any officially recognised guidance that is available 
to govern the way it is done. Broadly speaking, the impact of a noise can be assessed 
either in terms of its absolute level or as a specific level relative to the ambient or 
background noise in which it occurs, or as a combination of the two. A special case 
occurs for the second of these where an existing noise is increased in level, all other 
things staying the same, and it may be this change that is the most relevant factor in 
these circumstances. 
An absolute level can be expressed in many different ways, as can be seen from 
the range of noise indices available, including the various noise ‘dose’ indices, such as 
Lden, which are only really applicable to predictive assessments, such as noise contour 
mapping, as they cannot be determined uniquely by measurement. Relative levels, 
in turn, are often difficult to quantify as both the specific noise (that which is being 
assessed) and the background or ambient noise (that which exists in the absence of 
the specific noise) are usually constantly varying. Assessment methodologies that 
utilise a comparison such as this require a way of processing the background/ambient 
noise in order to provide a statistically repeatable comparator to be defined. This may 25
The Measurement and Assessment of Noise
be achieved by averaging the data over specified times of the day/night and, in the 
case of wind turbine noise assessment, wind conditions. For clarity, ‘ambient’ noise 
in these circumstances usually refers to measurements using the LAeq measurement 
index and background noise usually refers to measurements using the LA90 index. 
Acoustic character correction
For the purposes of assessment, it is often necessary to correct (or ‘penalise’) the 
specific noise where it has a distinctive character, or acoustic feature, that makes it 
more annoying than an equivalent noise of the same level without such features. This 
is not, however, ubiquitous across all noise assessment guidance and, for instance, 
is rarely applied to transportation noise or construction noise with the main focus 
of character correction being applied to industrial and commercial noise (see for 
instance BS 4142). 
Where the noise character is an integral feature of the noise, such as that from 
music sources, or from predominantly low frequency noise sources, the assessment 
may be required for specific octave or 1/3rd octave bands (see frequency analysis 
(above)). This would certainly be required for any objective assessment of potential 
audibility.
Noise ‘rating’ (NR) curves are also used to assess the suitability of an acoustic 
environment for different purposes by comparing the ambient noise level in octave 
bands with a series of reference curves; the intention being that the rating is met if 
the ambient noise level is below the specified rating NR curve in all bands. Figure 
3.5 shows a noise spectrum that just meets NR55.
The equivalent in the USA are noise criterion (NC) curves, which serve the same 
purpose. They are generally used in specifications for acoustic spaces such as concert 
halls and recording studios but have, on occasion, been used as the basis for planning

conditions imposed on industrial and/or commercial sources of noise. The example 
below shows a noise spectrum which just meets NC55. 
Cumulative noise
It is far from clear whether cumulative noise from different sources is additive or 
whether a different noise source moderates the impact of a new noise or, indeed, 
whether the new noise moderates the impact of the existing noise. This varies 
according to the guidance available for the specific source. BS 4142, for instance, 
treats all background noise as a moderating factor in noise impact assessment. 
ETSU-R-97, for wind turbine noise, treats all wind turbine noise from any source as 
additive. Generally, this has to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 
RELEVANT GUIDANCE AND STANDARDS
A brief overview is provided here of some of the guidance and standards available 
for the measurement and assessment of noise that affects members of the public. 
The methodologies covered here are by no means exhaustive and further documents, 
specifically those with legal status, are referred to in subsequent chapters, as well as 
reference being made in these chapters to some of the documents discussed here. It 
should be noted that none of the below have strictly legal status, except where they 
relate to the Noise Insulation Regulations (1975) or the Noise Insulation (Railways 
and Other Guided Transport Systems) Regulations (1996) as discussed in Chapter 
8. They can, however, be considered as comprising current best practice and, as such, 
are likely to be given considerable weight in any legal proceedings. 
In all cases, only a brief synopsis of each document is presented, and for more 
information reference must be made to the specific documents themselves and any 
revisions or other updates that are made available.
BS 4142 – Methods for Rating and Assessing Industrial and Commercial Sound
This standard4
 has been in existence, in various forms, since 1967, with a precursor 
to it appearing as an appendix in the 1963 Wilson Report (see Chapter 2). The 
current version, dated 2014, with an amendment made in 2019, represents the latest 
in an evolving series. As the title suggests, it is aimed at assessment of noise from 
industrial and commercial premises. It does this by comparing the noise that is being 
assessed, measured externally as an LAeq, with the noise that exists in its absence, 
measured as an LA90 (the ‘background’ noise). The noise that is being assessed is 
corrected or ‘penalised’ if it contains significant tones, impulses, intermittency or 
other features that are ‘readily distinctive against the residual acoustic environment’. 
This corrected, or penalised, noise is referred to as the ‘rating level’. In short, the 
greater the difference between the rating level and the background noise, the greater 
the magnitude of the impact of the noise being assessed. A difference of around 
+10 dB or more is ‘likely to be an indication of a significant adverse impact’. A 
difference of around +5 dB is ‘likely to be an indication of an adverse impact’. It is 
stated that ‘the lower the rating level is, relative to the background noise, the less 
likely it is that the noise which is being assessed will have an adverse impact or a 
significant adverse impact’. 27
The Measurement and Assessment of Noise
It is stated that these levels of impact are dependent on ‘context’. This is, essentially 
a subjective element of the assessment wherein non-acoustic factors, such as likely 
attitude to the source, play a part. Reference is also made to the fact that, ‘where 
background noise levels and rating levels are low, absolute levels might be as, or 
more, relevant than the margin by which the rating level exceeds the background, 
particularly at night’. In addition, it states that
‘where residual sound levels are very high, the residual sound might itself result in adverse 
impacts or significant adverse impacts, and the margin by which the rating level exceeds 
the background might simply be an indication of the extent to which the specific sound 
source is likely to make those impacts worse’ (see BS 4142 p 17).
It can be seen that despite this assessment methodology being a ‘standard’, the 
flexibility it allows is open to some considerable interpretation.
BS 8233 – Guidance on Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings
This document8
 is particularly useful for noise assessment in that it contains details of 
appropriate noise levels for living rooms, dining rooms and bedroom during the day 
(sixteen hour average) and for bedrooms at night (eight hour average). It notes that 
the levels specified apply to noise without a specific character, generated externally, 
as it affects the internal acoustic environment. This reference to lack of acoustic 
character reflects the requirement in BS 4142 to correct measured or assessed noise 
levels for acoustic character (see above) although no such correction is specified by 
BS 8233. It notes that occupants are usually more tolerant of noise without a specific 
character and that non-acoustic characteristics, in the case of noise from neighbours, 
can trigger complex emotional reactions.
ISO 1996 – Acoustics – Description, Measurement and Assessment of Environmental 
Noise
This document9
 is divided into two parts: Part 1: Basic Quantities and Assessment 
Procedures; and Part 2: Determination of Sound Pressure Levels. This mirrors, in part, 
BS 7445, Description and Measurement of Environmental Noise, which has three parts, 
which correspond to the original version of ISO 1996. BS 7445 has not been updated 
as recently as ISO 1996, however. 
The ISO 1996 document essentially describes the measurement procedures to 
be used in determining external noise levels and is similar to the corresponding 
parts of BS 4142 in this regard. Part 2 also contains a detailed tonal assessment 
methodology.
BS 5228 – Code of Practice for Noise and Vibration Control on Construction and 
Open Sites – Noise
This standard consists of two parts relating to noise and vibration respectively. It 
describes what is essentially good practice, but Part 1 also provides source noise

data for an extensive range of plant and equipment used for construction purposes, 
together with noise prediction methodologies for static and mobile plant. It also 
includes suggested noise limits to apply to different times of the week in terms of 
LAeq noise levels. 
UK Government guidance on noise from extraction of minerals
This guidance includes noise limits in terms of LAeq for daytime, evening and night￾time.10
ETSU-R-97 – The Assessment and Rating of Wind Farm Noise and the IoA good 
practice guide
Wind farm noise is unique in that the source noise, and usually the background 
noise, particularly in rural areas where it is often dominated by wind in trees and 
foliage, both vary with wind speed. ETSU-R-97,5
 published in 1996, is essentially 
a refinement of BS 4142, adapting it for use in this case and introducing low noise 
limiting values to apply when background noise is low (see BS 4142, above, on 
this issue). It also specifies the use of LA90 for the source noise level, as well as for 
background noise, as the low levels of noise involved are easily contaminated by 
transient noises in the environment if quantified using LAeq. 
A good practice guide to the use of ETSU-R-97 was published by the UK 
Institute of Acoustics in 2013,11 which included recommendations on the prediction 
of noise from wind turbine developments that was not covered by ETSU-R-97. 
Noise from pubs and clubs and other music noise
Noise from pubs and clubs is covered by the 2006 Contract report NANR163 for the 
UK government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA),12
which provided recommendations on controlling noise from such sources, including 
an applicable absolute noise level criterion, as well as other noise indices which can 
be used to assess potential effects.
The Code of Practice on Environmental Noise Control at Concerts, produced by the 
Noise Council in 1995,13 made recommendations on controlling noise from concerts. 
The Noise Council was established by a group of professional bodies consisting of 
the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, the UK Institute of Acoustics, the 
Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland and the Institute of Occupational 
Safety and Health. It is no longer active but its code of practice continues to be 
referred to by those seeking to regulate and control noise from concerts.

The Measurement and Assessment of Noise
Noise from clay target shooting 
This is covered by the 2003 publication by the Chartered Institute of Environmental 
Health, Clay Target Shooting – Guidance on the Control of Noise,
14 which includes a 
methodology and noise index, the ‘shooting noise level’, for its assessment. Guideline 
values are suggested in terms of a level below which annoyance is less likely to occur 
(55 dBA) and level above which it is highly likely to occur (65 dBA). The shooting 
noise level is defined as the logarithmic average of the loudest twenty-five shots in a 
thirty minute measurement period. 
DEFRA low frequency noise criteria
Contract report NANR 45 for DEFRA15 described limits that could be applicable 
to internal noise that is specifically low frequency in character. These are specified as 
1/3 octave band LAeq levels from 10 to 160 Hz. 
Publications by the World Health Organisation
The WHO has published a number of documents on appropriate noise criteria for 
protecting members of the public from excessive noise. The first of these was in 198016
and recommends specific LAeq noise levels for the prevention of ‘serious’ annoyance 
during the day and sleep disturbance at night, externally and internally, respectively.
This was followed in 1999 by the more detailed Guidelines for Community Noise,
17
which also contained similar recommended noise guideline values, but which covered 
more environments and an additional guideline value for preventing ‘moderate’ 
annoyance externally, in addition to that for serious annoyance. It also included an 
external noise guideline value for preventing sleep disturbance at night.
In 2009 this was followed by the Night Noise Guidelines for Europe,
18 which 
introduced the concept of a yearly LAeq evaluated over the night-time hours and 
referred to as Lnight, outside and a criterion level of 40 dB Lnight, outside to prevent adverse 
health effects ‘such as self-reported sleep disturbance, environmental insomnia’, and 
increased use of sleep-inducing drugs and sedatives. 
In 2018 the WHO published Environmental Noise Guidelines for the European 
Region,
19 which provided specific noise target values for protecting human health 
from transportation noise (road, rail and aircraft), wind turbine noise and leisure 
noise. Industrial and other commercial noise was not included. The criteria for the 
transportation sources are set in terms of Lden and Lnight values provided. Only the 
Lden value is included for wind turbine noise and, for leisure noise, the criterion is set 
in term of the yearly twenty-four hour LAeq value and doesn’t include any time of day 
corrections, as are used for the calculation of Lden.

Noise prediction methodologies
Noise predictions, particularly from industrial and commercial activities, where they 
are not inherent in the assessment methodologies described above, are commonly 
carried out with reference to ISO 9613 – Acoustics – Attenuation of Sound During 
Propagation Outdoors.
20 The standard comes in two parts with Part 1 being solely 
concerned with the provision of values for atmospheric attenuation for different 
meteorological conditions (temperature and relative humidity) and Part 2 being that 
providing the methodology used for the predictions that consists of the quantification 
of a number of ‘attenuation factors’, including that from the atmosphere, relevant to 
noise propagation. A number of alternative methodologies to that contained in ISO 
9613 are also available. 
Noise from road traffic is more usually covered by the Calculation of Road 
Traffic Noise, published by the then Department of Transport and Welsh Office in 
1988.21 This is used to quantify traffic noise for the purposes of the Noise Insulation 
Regulations,22 as discussed in Chapter 8. 
Noise from railways is, similarly, covered by the Calculation of Railway Noise, 
published by Department of Transport in 199523 and used to quantify railway noise 
for the purposes of the Noise Insulation (Railways and Other Guided Transport 
Systems) Regulations 1996,24 as also discussed in Chapter 8.

Common Law Nuisance 
INTRODUCTION
In this chapter we look at how the common law has attempted to provide redress for 
a variety of adverse circumstances (including the creation of noise) that unreasonably 
affects an individual’s enjoyment of the land which they occupy. The law recognises the 
fact that the occupier (for example, by virtue of being the owner, tenant or subtenant) 
of land has the right to enjoy the occupation of that land. However, such a right is 
circumscribed by the law imposing an obligation on that occupier not to use their land 
in such a manner as to unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment their neighbour’s 
occupation of their land.1
 That is to say, that one’s neighbour possesses a similar right 
to enjoy the occupation of their land. The rights of the respective occupiers can often 
conflict with each other. For example, I may choose to sit at home in the evening and 
read, whereas my musically-inclined neighbour may wish to practice with his drum 
kit, the upshot of which is that I am discomfited. Essentially, the function of the law 
of nuisance is to strike a reasonable balance between these conflicting rights.2
 In the 
Court of Appeal case of Fearn v Tate Modern Modern Galleries3
 it was held that the 
unifying principle in the law of nuisance was reasonableness between neighbours. In 
short, the governing principle is ‘good neighbourliness’ and this involves reciprocity 
between neighbours.4
 The law was neatly summarised by Lord President Cooper in 
Watt v Jamieson5
 when he stated:
‘The balance in all cases has to be held between the freedom of a proprietor to use 
his property as he pleases, and the duty on a proprietor not to inflict material loss or 
inconvenience on adjoining proprietors, and in every case the answer depends on 
considerations of fact and degree. The critical question is whether what he was exposed to 
was plus quam tolerabile, when due weight has been given to all the circumstances of the 
offensive conduct, and its effects.’
Watt, therefore, is authority for the proposition that before an adverse state of affairs 
can be categorised as a nuisance, it must be plus quam tolerabile (i.e. more than can be 
reasonably endured) in the eyes of the law. However, the concept of reasonableness is, 
1 See e.g. Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd [1997] Env LR 488. 2 See Baxter v Camden LBC (No 2) [2001] 1 AC 1 at 20 (per Lord Millett). 3 [2020] EWCA Civ 104 at [38]. For a discussion of Fearn see (2020) 153 Rep.B. 5; D Howarth [2020]

32
some consider, vague, and at worst, a meaningless shibboleth that offers little guidance 
as to whether the adverse state of affairs, which is the subject matter of the action, 
ranks as a nuisance. Indeed, some have argued that the notion of reasonableness has 
now become redundant and misleading in many cases of private nuisance.6 Watt also 
emphasises the point that whether any given state of affairs ranks as a nuisance is a 
matter of fact and degree.7
 For example, the louder the noise from my neighbour’s 
television, the more likely the courts will be inclined to classify the adverse state of 
affairs as a nuisance in law. The outcome of any nuisance case is, indeed, fact-sensitive 
and will depend on the claimant being able to convince the court that they were 
unreasonably discomfited by the relevant adverse state of affairs.8
ELEMENTS OF THE LAW OF NUISANCE
We now discuss the various factors that the courts apply when considering whether 
any adverse state of affairs ranks as a nuisance in law. However, it is important to 
emphasise that only unreasonable conduct is capable of being categorised as a nuisance 
in law.9
 A leading case that illustrates this important point is Baxter v Camden LBC
(No 2).
10 In that case, the claimants were local authority tenants. They occupied flats 
that had been constructed, or adapted, for multiple occupation. However, the flats 
were inadequately soundproofed, the result being that the tenants could hear literally 
everything their neighbours were doing. The tenants, therefore, brought proceedings 
inter alia, in nuisance against their landlords. However, the House of Lords held 
that the relevant noise did not rank as a nuisance since the noise emanated from the 
normal and everyday use of the relevant flats. In short, the noise in question did not 
emanate from the unreasonable use of property.
What factors are taken into account?
We now consider the various factors that are taken into account in determining 
whether the adverse state of affairs does rank as a nuisance in law. However, it is 
important to note at the outset that the courts do not mechanically apply all these 
factors in every nuisance case. Rather, the courts have tended to emphasise certain 
factors, often to the exclusion of others.11 Furthermore, it should be emphasised 
that the courts have refrained from constructing a hierarchy in terms of the relative 
6 M Lee, ‘What is a private nuisance’ (2003) 119 LQR 298 at 298.
7 See also Mutter v Fyffe (1848) 11 D 303; Haddon v Lynch [1911] VLR 230 and Howarth v Canadian 
Red Cross Society [1943] 2 WWR 692. 8 See e.g. MacBean v Scottish Water [2020] CSOH 55 where it was held on the evidence presented before 
the court that the odours that emanated from the defender’s waste water treatment plant, which was 
situated in the vicinity of the pursuer’s property, did not rank as a nuisance.

144; See also Pugliesi v National Capital (1977) 3 CCLT 18 at 51 where Howland JA stated that 
in determining whether a nuisance exists it is not sufficient to ask whether an occupier has made 
reasonable use of his own property. Rather, one must ask whether his conduct is reasonable, considering 
the fact that he has a neighbour. See also Baxter (above) at 20 (per Lord Millett) and also Fearn v Tate 
Modern Galleries [2020] EWCA Civ 104. See (2020) 199 SPEL 58 and (2020) 153 Rep.B. 5. 10 [2001] 1 AC 1. 11 See e.g. Fleming v Hislop (1882) 10 R 426; (1886) 13 R (HL) 43 where the court simply focused on 
the smell from the offending mineral refuse situated on the defender’s premises.33
Common Law Nuisance
importance of each factor. It should be further emphasised that the factors that are 
discussed are probably not exhaustive. That is to say, that the list is not closed.
Social utility
The social utility of the activity, which generates the state of affairs that is the subject 
matter of the action, is taken into account in the court’s deciding whether a nuisance 
exists. Essentially, the more socially useful the activity is, the less likely the court 
will be willing to castigate the activity as a nuisance in law.12 The concept of social 
or public utility is not well-articulated in terms of the law of nuisance. However, the 
courts have been readily inclined to recognise the concept of social or public utility 
in relation to factories.13 However, as far as other activities are concerned the courts 
have displayed more reticence, preferring simply to take this factor into account 
when considering whether to grant an interdict or an injunction.14 Dennis v Ministry 
of Defence15 illustrates this point. In that case, the claimants owned and lived in a 
large estate that was situated in close proximity to RAF Wittering, which was then 
the home of the Harrier jet, which was a noisy aircraft. Indeed, the witnesses who 
gave evidence before the court described the noise as sometimes intolerable. The 
claimants brought an action in nuisance against the MoD. Buckley J accepted the 
former’s claim to the effect that that the noise in question amounted to a nuisance.16
However, it was also beyond dispute that the flying of military aircraft was in the 
public interest.17 Put simply, Britain needed its air force, including aircraft that, at 
times, created noise. However, to weigh this factor in the judicial scales when deciding 
if the noise in question ranked as a nuisance would deprive the claimants of a remedy 
at common law.18 In the view of the judge, the growing corpus of human rights law 
dictated that the appropriate remedy under the law of nuisance should be that of 
damages, as opposed to, for example, a declaration or an injunction. However, in the 
Outer House case of King v Advocate General for Scotland19 Lord Pentland refrained 
from expressing the view that Dennis represented the law of Scotland. It can be 
said that Dennis does not, on the grounds that the factors that the courts consider 
whether a nuisance exists should be kept quite separate from relevant remedies. To 
link the latter to the former would lead to confusion in the law of nuisance. 
Motive of the defender
If the relevant adverse state of affairs (in the present context the creation of noise) is 
caused by the defender to simply punish, or annoy, the pursuer, the courts are readily 
prepared to accept the fact that the noise ranks as a nuisance in law. The leading case 
12 Harrison v Southwark Water Co Ltd [1891] 2 Ch 409. 13 See e.g. Bellew v Cement Ltd [1948] IR 61. 14 See e.g. Miller v Jackson [1977] QB 966 and Webster v Lord Advocate 1984 SLT 13. The decision of the 
Outer House was reversed in terms of the interdict that was granted on appeal to the Inner House; 
1985 SC 173. 15 [2003] EHLR 17. 16 [2003] EHLR 17 at [34]. 17 [2003] EHLR 17 at [45]. 18 [2003] EHLR 17 at [46]. 19 2009 CSOH 169 at [17].NOISE AND NOISE LAW

here is Christie v Davy.20 In that case, the claimants were musically inclined. They 
frequently practised their instruments at home. This annoyed the defendant, who 
resided next door to the claimants. The former decided to retaliate by banging trays 
on the party wall. It was held that the noise that the defendant created ranked as a 
nuisance. Another example of the relevance of malice in terms of the law of nuisance 
is illustrated in Hollywood Silver Fox Farm Ltd v Emmet.21 Here the claimant bred 
foxes on his land. The defendant, who was about to develop the land that adjoined 
that of the claimant, objected to the presence of foxes on grounds that the former 
feared that this would deter people from purchasing houses on the estate. The 
defendant, therefore, caused shots to be fired on the boundary that separated his 
premises from that of the claimant. It was held that the defendant’s conduct ranked 
as a nuisance in law.
Locality
In deciding whether a state of affairs is a nuisance the courts take into account the 
nature of the relevant locality.22 Essentially, the more typical in nature the state of 
affairs is, in relation to the relevant locality, the less likely the state of affairs will 
be categorised by the court as a nuisance. The rationale here is that if the state of 
affairs is typical of a given locality, a reasonable person who resides in that locality 
is presumed to be less likely to be annoyed, by having become habituated, at least to 
some extent, to the state of affairs in question.23
However, whilst the courts may be less inclined to castigate as a nuisance a 
state of affairs that is indigenous in an area, the courts are not prepared to accord 
carte blanche to create a nuisance there. For example, in Rushmer v Polsue and Alfieri 
Ltd24 the claimant resided in an area that was especially devoted to the printing and 
allied trades. The defendants set up machinery that caused serious disturbance to 
the claimant and his family during night-time hours. At first instance, the court 
granted an injunction, restraining the defendants from causing a noise nuisance. 
The defendants appealed. The House of Lords dismissed the appeal. Lord Loreburn 
stated25:
‘A dweller in towns cannot expect to have as pure air, as free from smoke, smell and noise, 
as if he lived in the country, and distant from other dwellings, and yet an excess of smoke, 
smell and noise may give a cause of action, but in each case it becomes a question of 
degree, and the question in each case is whether it gives rise to a nuisance which will give 
rise to an action. This is a question of fact.’
However, the nature of the locality is only relevant if it affects personal comfort. That 
is to say, that if the adverse state of affairs causes physical damage to property of 
the claimant, the locality principle is redundant. The leading case here is the House

of Lords case of St Helens Smelting Co v Tipping.
26 In that case, vapours from the 
defendant’s copper-smelting works, which was situated in a heavily industrialised 
area, damaged trees on the claimant’s estate. The House decided in favour of the 
claimant. The House held it irrelevant that the claimant lived in an industrial area. In 
short, the nature of the locality was irrelevant.27
Locality and the effect of planning law
To what extent, if any, does the grant of planning have on the application of the 
locality factor in relation to the law of nuisance? For example, if a planning authority 
were to designate an area (that was formerly designated as green belt) for industrial 
use in the development plan, and then the planning authority proceeded to grant 
planning permission for the erection of a factory on the land, to what extent, if 
any, would it be legitimate for the court to take this factor into account when it 
was making its decision as to whether or not effluvium from the factory ranked as 
a nuisance in law. In short, could the occupiers of the factory argue that whereas 
the land on which the factory stood was once green belt, it was now an industrial 
area, and that this factor should be taken into account by the court when it decides 
whether or not the effluvium ranks as a nuisance?
The leading case is the Supreme Court case of Lawrence v Fen Tigers Ltd.
28
The facts of the case were simple. Planning permission was granted in 1979 to 
construct a sports complex and stadium. At first, speedway racing took place. Later, 
banger and stock car racing was introduced. Planning permission was subsequently 
granted for other motor-related sports. The claimants, who lived in close proximity 
to the stadium, became affected by noise from the stadium. They raised an action 
against the organisers of the motor sports, amongst others. At first instance, it was 
held that the noise that emanated from the stadium constituted a nuisance in law. On 
appeal, the Court of Appeal held that both the grant of planning permission, coupled 
with the implementation of that permission, had the effect of changing the character 
of the area in terms of the law of nuisance. For the court the key question was the 
effect of implementing the planning permission. The court held that the trial judge 
had been wrong in deciding that the character of the land had not been changed by 
both the grant and the subsequent implementation of the planning permission. In 
conclusion, the noise in question did not rank as a nuisance in law. The claimants 
successfully appealed to the Supreme Court.
As far as the significance of planning permission in terms of the law of 
nuisance was concerned, Lord Neuberger was of the view that the implementation 
of planning permission could give rise to a change of character of the locality.29
However, simply because the relevant work had been given planning permission was 
no different from work that did not require planning permission. Furthermore, the 
mere fact that the activity that is said to give rise to the nuisance had the benefit 
of planning permission, would normally be of no assistance to the defendant in a 
26 (1865) 11 HL Cas 642. 27 For an interesting discussion of Tipping, see A. Simpson, Leading Cases in the Common Law (OUP, 
1997) Ch 7. 28 [2014] AC 822. 29 [2014] AC 822 at 846.NOISE AND NOISE LAW

nuisance action.30 In turn, Lord Carnwath, after stating that there should be a strong 
presumption against allowing private rights to be overridden by administrative 
decisions without compensation, stated that in exceptional cases (i.e. in relation to 
large-scale developments) a planning permission could be the result of a considered 
policy decision by the competent authority, which could not sensibly be ignored in 
assessing the character of the area, against which the acceptability of the defendant’s 
activity was to be judged.31
By way of conclusion, whereas the Supreme Court had a splendid opportunity to 
clarify the law as to the effect of the town and country planning regime on the law 
of nuisance in relation to the former’s ability to change the character of land for the 
purposes of the latter, some would say that that opportunity was missed. However, 
Lawrence does establish the fact that normally planning permission is an irrelevant 
factor in the equation and, therefore, should be accorded little import. In the last 
analysis, this issue remains a rather grey area of law. 
Lawrence, however, is not binding on the Scottish courts and does not, in the view 
of the author, represent the law of Scotland, that is to say that planning permission 
has no relevance in a private nuisance action north of the border.32
Duration and intensity
Essentially, the length of time a state of affairs lasts, and its intensity, are taken into 
account by the court when it considers if a nuisance exists. In the leading case of 
Bamford v Turnley33 Pollock CB stated:
‘A clock striking the hour, or a bell ringing for some domestic purpose, may be a nuisance, 
if unreasonably loud or discordant, of which the jury must judge; but although not 
unreasonably loud, if the owner, from some whim or caprice made the clock strike every 10 
minutes, or the bell ring continually, I think that the jury would be justified in considering 
it to be a very great nuisance.’
As far as noise nuisances are concerned, the nature of the noise is a relevant factor 
in determining whether the noise ranks as a nuisance in law. The more pleasant￾sounding the noise is, the less likely will it be deemed a nuisance.34
Time of day
The time of day during which an adverse state of affairs exists is only relevant in 
relation to noise and, perhaps, light. The courts are more inclined to regard night￾time noise as a nuisance than noise that takes place during the day.35 The obvious 
reason for this is that noise that manifests itself during the night-time hours is more 
likely to disturb than noise that only takes place during the day.

Common Law Nuisance
Sensitivity of the claimant 
It is a general rule in law that the courts are unwilling to assist the over-sensitive. As 
far as noise pollution is concerned, the leading case is Heath v Brighton Corporation.
36
In that case a priest complained about noise and vibrations that emanated from the 
defendants’ electricity generating station. However, the court denied him a remedy 
in terms of the law of nuisance, since the only reason he was discomfited was that he 
possessed hypersensitive hearing.37
Social utility of thing interfered with
The question that is to be answered here is the extent, if any, to which the court takes 
into account the social utility of that which is interfered with by the conduct of the 
defendant. The leading cases have concerned the reception of television signals. In 
Bridlington Relay Ltd v Yorkshire Electricity Board,
38 which concerned liability for the 
reception of television signals, Buckley J took into account the fact that, in the main, 
television simply served a recreational function in society and he, therefore, accorded 
lowly status in deciding whether the interference ranked as a nuisance in law. 
However, in the House of Lords case of Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd,
39 which 
concerned the potential liability in nuisance, comprising the presence of a tall 
building that interfered with the reception of television signals, Lord Goff expressed 
the view that television transcended the mere function of entertainment and that 
interference with such amenity might, indeed, be protected by the law of nuisance.40
Could the adverse state of affairs have been avoided by the claimant?
To what extent, if any, can the court take into account the fact that the relevant 
adverse state of affairs (for example, the effects of noise) could have been avoided by 
the claimant? While there is little authority on this point, the general rule is that the 
courts are unwilling to place the claimant under an obligation to take preventative 
or remedial action to counter the noise, etc. This point is neatly illustrated in the 
leading case of Webster v Lord Advocate.
41 The pursuer, who lived in the vicinity of 
Edinburgh Castle esplanade, raised an action against the defender, alleging that 
both the noise from the performance of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, and also 
the erection of the scaffolding to accommodate the seating on the castle esplanade, 
amounted to a nuisance. The Lord Ordinary rejected the contention that the pursuer 
would be unable to succeed if it could be shown that the provision of double glazing 
to the windows of the pursuer’s flat would have reduced the ingress of noise to an 
acceptable level.42

Is the state of affairs typical of modern life?
In determining whether any given state of affairs ranks as a nuisance, to what extent, 
if any, is it relevant that the state of affairs that is complained of is typical of modern 
life? There is little authority on this point. However, in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd43
(above) where the House of Lords held that the mere presence of a tall building that 
interfered with the reception of television signals, could not rank as an actionable 
nuisance, in the Court of Appeal, Pill LJ (in deciding that the building did not 
constitute a nuisance) was of the view that tall and bulky buildings had become a 
feature of urban landscapes and, therefore, less likely to rank as a nuisance. However, 
the judge seemed to suggest that that factor may not be relevant if the state of affairs 
comprised an activity as opposed to the mere presence of a building.
LIABILITY IN NUISANCE – WHO MAY BE SUED?
The author of the nuisance
The person who creates the nuisance, namely the author of the nuisance, is liable in 
law.44 The author need not have any interest in the land from which the nuisance 
arises to be held liable.45 For example, the organisers of a so-called ‘rave’ that is held 
on vacant land could be held liable in law for any noise nuisance that is caused, 
notwithstanding the fact that the organisers have no propriety interest in the land. 
The occupier of land
The occupier of the land from which the nuisance emanates is normally liable in 
law.46 The basis of liability is both the possession and also the control of the land 
from which the nuisance proceeds.47 However, the occupier of land is not liable 
for an adverse state of affairs that has been created by a third party, for example, 
in relation to a noise nuisance, a trespasser, unless the occupier takes insufficient 
steps to abate the nuisance after they becomes aware of its presence, either actually 
or constructively, in which case the law will presume that they have adopted the 
nuisance. This principle was established in a trilogy of leading cases. It should be 
mentioned that whereas the facts of the respective cases do not relate to noise 
pollution, the legal principles that derive from the cases are of general applicability.
In Sedleigh-Denfield v O’Callaghan48 local authority trespassed on the land of the 
defendant and then constructed a culvert on a ditch. One of the employees of the 
defendant knew of the existence of the culvert. Furthermore, the defendants used 
the culvert to get rid of water from their own property. However, the culvert was not 
properly constructed, the upshot of which was that it became blocked with detritus. 
A heavy thunderstorm caused the ditch to be flooded. The claimant’s land became 
flooded. The House of Lords held the defendants liable in nuisance by virtue of both 
43 [1997] Env LR 488 at 493. 44 Watt v Jamieson 1954 SC 56. 45 Slater v McLellan 1924 SC 854; Marcic v Thames Water Utilities [2004] 2 AC 42. 46 Sedleigh-Denfield v O’Callaghan [1940] AC 880; Smith v Scott [1973] Ch 314. 47 [1940] AC 880 at 903 (per Lord Wright). 48 As above (fn 46).39
Common Law Nuisance
continuing and adopting the nuisance. The defendants had continued the nuisance 
by virtue of failing to take the necessary remedial action after the defendants had 
become aware (through their servant) of the existence of the nuisance. The nuisance 
had also been adopted by the defendants since they had used the nuisance for their 
own purposes.
The Privy Council had the opportunity to discuss liability in the law of nuisance 
in respect of a nuisance that had been created on the defendant’s property not by the 
act of a third party but, rather, by nature in Goldman v Hargrave.
49 In that case, a 
tall gum tree that was situated on the defendant’s land was struck by lightning and 
then caught fire. The defendant cut down the tree the following day. However, he did 
not take further steps to prevent the fire from spreading, preferring to simply allow 
the fire to burn itself out. Several days later the weather changed. The wind became 
stronger and the air temperature increased. This caused the fire to revive. It spread 
over the plaintiff ’s land, which was damaged. 
The Privy Council held that the defendant was liable for the harm that had been 
caused to the plaintiff ’s land, on the grounds that the former had failed to remove 
the hazard from his land. In so deciding, the Board held that no distinction fell to be 
made between liability in terms of the law of negligence and liability in nuisance.50
However, in deciding whether the defendant had reached the standard of care that 
the law demanded, one was required to take into account the defendant’s knowledge 
of the hazard, as well as his ability to foresee the consequences of not checking or 
removing it, and also the ability to abate the nuisance.51 However, in deciding whether 
the defendant had failed to attain the standard of care that the law demanded of him, 
one was required to adopt a subjective approach. One would, therefore, require to 
take into account the resources of the defendant. One would also expect less of the 
occupier of small premises than one would of the occupier of larger premises. Again, 
less would be demanded of the infirm than of the able bodied.
The Court of Appeal had the opportunity to apply the learning in Sedleigh￾Denfield and Goldman, in Leakey v National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or 
Natural Beauty.
52 In that case, the claimants owned houses that were situated at 
the base of a steep conical hill. Part of the hill that adjoined the claimants’ land had 
become unstable. The condition of the hill was made known to the defendants by 
the claimants. However, no remedial action was taken by the former. A few weeks 
later there was a substantial fall of earth and tree stumps from the hill on to the 
claimants’ land. The claimants then brought an action against the defendant. The 
court held the defendant liable. In so doing, the court refused to draw a distinction 
between an adverse state of affairs that had been foist on the defendant by man-made 
activities and those which arose by the operation of nature. Megaw LJ, in endorsing 
the decisions in both Sedleigh-Denfield and Goldman, discussed53 both the nature 
49 [1967] 1 AC 645. 50 In Delaware Mansions Ltd v Westminster City Council [2001] 1 AC 321 at 323 Lord Cooke expressed 
the view that in circumstances that were similar to those in Sedleigh-Denfield and Goldman, the label 
‘nuisance’ and ‘negligence’ were of no real significance. 51 [1967] 1 AC 645 at 663 (per Lord Wilberforce). See also Bybrook Barn Garden Centre Ltd v Kent 
County Council [2000] Env LR 30. 52 [1980] QB 485. 53 [1980] QB 485 at 524.NOISE AND NOISE LAW
40
and scope of the affirmative duty that the law imposes on the occupier of land in 
relation to nuisances that had been foist on them. In his Lordship’s view, the extent 
of the harm to the claimant’s premises should an accident occur, the practicability of 
preventative action, the cost of remedial works, and also the time that was available to 
take remedial action, were all relevant in determining the liability of the defendant.
The landlord
A landlord is not liable for every nuisance that emanates from premises that they 
have leased to a third party.54 Therefore, if I lease my house to a third party who 
proceeds to regularly hold noisy house parties, and thereby causes a nuisance to the 
residents of adjoining property, I would not be liable in terms of the law of nuisance. 
A landlord is only liable in nuisance if the creation of noise by the tenant is either 
the certain, or a highly probable, result of the tenant’s occupation of the relevant 
premises.55
The licensor of the nuisance
The person who authorises the creation of the relevant nuisance is liable,56 especially 
if they make no attempt to either abate, or remove the nuisance, after they become 
aware of its existence. The leading case on this point is Webster v Lord Advocate.
57 In 
that case, the pursuer claimed that the noise from the performance of the Edinburgh 
Military Tattoo and also the erection of scaffolding to accommodate seating on the 
Edinburgh Castle esplanade, amounted to a nuisance in law. The Lord Ordinary 
accepted that the Secretary of State for Scotland, as occupier of the esplanade, was 
liable for the nuisance which had been created by the erection of the scaffolding, 
on the basis that he had authorised the creation of the nuisance. The judge held it 
irrelevant that the contract between the Secretary of State and the Tattoo policy 
committee (which was responsible for staging the Tattoo) contained a ‘no nuisance’ 
condition, since no attempt had been made by the latter to either monitor, or to 
inspect the activities of the licensee, or to enforce the condition.58 Therefore, if a 
licensor was capable and, did take appropriate measures to enforce a ‘no-nuisance’ 
condition in the relevant contract, he could potentially, escape liability for having 
authorised a nuisance.
54 Smith v Scott [1973] Ch 314. See also Lawrence v Fen Tigers Ltd (No 2) [2015] AC 106 at 113 (per 
Lord Neuberger). 55 In Smith v Scott (above) at 321 Pennycuik V-C was of the view that the proper test was that of ‘virtual 
certainty’, which was another way of saying ‘a high degree of probability’. In Tetley v Chitty [1986] 1 
All ER 663 at 671 McNeill J was of the view that the proper test for establishing the liability of lessors, 
in terms of the law of nuisance, was whether the creation of the nuisance was the ordinary or necessary 
or the natural consequence of the operation of the lease. See also Dunn v Hamilton (1837) 15 S 853 
and Caledonian Railway Co v Baird (1876) 3R 839. 56 Baxter v Camden LBC (No 2) [2001] 1 AC 1 at 22 (per Lord Millett). 57 1984 SLT 13. The decision of the court was reversed, on appeal, by the Inner House in relation to the

Common Law Nuisance
DEFENCES
The authors now consider defences that have specific application to the law of 
nuisance.
Statutory authority
The basis of this defence is that if Parliament has sanctioned or approved the creation 
of the nuisance, this deprives the claimant a remedy. However, the defence only applies 
to the direct sanction of the adverse state of affairs by an Act of Parliament. For 
example, if the state of affairs that generates (for example, noise) has been approved 
by the grant of planning permission, such approval would not have a similar effect in 
denying the pursuer a remedy.59 The defence of statutory authority was commonly 
invoked during the course of the nineteenth century in nuisances cases, stemming 
from the operation of the railways.60 Indeed, much of the authority on the defence 
of statutory authority derives from the so-called ‘railway cases’, which represent a 
rather untidy area of law. Fortunately, the law that was embodied in the railway cases 
was reviewed and clarified by the House of Lords in Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd.
61
In that case, a private Act of Parliament62 authorised a multi-national company 
to acquire land that was situated in a rural area to construct an oil refinery. However, 
soon after the refinery commenced operations residents who lived in the vicinity 
began to complain about the smell, noise and vibration that emanated from the 
plant. The House held that the Act had, by necessary implication, authorised both 
the construction and operation of the oil refinery, the inevitable consequence of 
which was the creation of the nuisance in question. The claimants, therefore, failed 
in their action.
However, the defence of statutory authority does not apply if the relevant 
activities are being carried out negligently.63 Finally, if the relevant statute authorises 
the activity to be carried out without causing a nuisance the defence of statutory 
authority is inapplicable if the activity is carried out in such a manner as to cause a 
nuisance.64
While there is no authority on this point, it is suggested that the defence of 
statutory authority would also be applicable to an activity that has been authorised 
by an order that has been made by the Scottish Ministers under s 1 of the Transport 
and Works (Scotland) Act 2007.

and City Rly v Brand (1869–1870) LR 4 HL 171.NOISE AND NOISE LAW
42
Prescription 
It is possible to acquire the right to create a noise nuisance by way of prescription.65
In order for an individual to acquire such a right, the noise must have remained in 
uninterrupted existence for twenty years or more. Furthermore, in order that the 
defence can succeed, the noise must have remained substantially constant over the 
prescriptive period.66 The noise must also have constituted an actionable nuisance 
over that period.67 Furthermore, on the authority of both Sturges and Webster the 
nuisance need not have been in perpetual existence over the prescriptive period for 
the defence to succeed, that is to say, it is sufficient that the nuisance manifests itself 
on a regular basis. For the defence of prescription to succeed the claimant must have 
had either actual or constructive knowledge of the existence of the nuisance.68 The 
relevant prescriptive period commences from the date on which the claimant could 
successfully have raised an action against the defendant.69
If the defendant does acquire the right to continue a nuisance, he does not thereby 
acquire the right either to create another nuisance or to increase the intensity of the 
nuisance, in respect of which the prescriptive right has been acquired.70
Acquiescence
As far as Scotland is concerned, an individual may lose their right to raise an 
action in nuisance if they acquiesce in the face of a nuisance. Whereas the defence 
of acquiescence has some similarity to that of prescription, the former is a quite 
separate defence.71 The defence of acquiescence must be specifically pled.72 For the 
defence to succeed there requires a clear unequivocal and positive act on the part of 
the pursuer that indicates that they have consented to the nuisance in question. The 
person who is alleged to have acquiesced is required to have had both full knowledge 
of, and also the power, to stop the nuisance.73 Mere silence or passiveness in the face 
of the nuisance on the part of the pursuer is insufficient to ground the defence.74
However, the occupation of the land affected by the nuisance, coupled with the 
knowledge of the existence of the nuisance, is capable of raising the presumption that 
the pursuer has acquiesced.75 The longer the pursuer remains impassive in the face 
of the nuisance, the stronger is the presumption that they have acquiesced in its face. 
However, in Colville v Middleton76 it was held that twenty-two years passive inaction

Common Law Nuisance
was insufficient to ground the defence. Since the defence is based on implied consent, 
the defence is redundant if the pursuer objects timeously to the relevant state of 
affairs.77 Furthermore, the pursuer can only acquiesce in the face of the nuisance, 
in contradistinction to the creation of the state of affairs from which the nuisance 
arises.78 For example, an occupier of premises could only be held to have acquiesced 
in relation to noise that emanates from a newly established factory that is situated in 
the vicinity of their premises, in contrast to the mere presence of the factory before 
it commences to operate. The act or acts of acquiescence can be implied from the 
circumstances of the case.79 The defence does not apply if the nuisance differs either 
in nature or intensity from that which has been consented to.80
However, the courts are unwilling to infer acceptance or acquiescence of a given 
state of affairs from the mere fact that the pursuer has ‘come to’ the nuisance. The 
leading case is now Webster v Lord Advocate81 where the court refused to accept the 
proposition that simply because the pursuer, by choosing to live in the vicinity of the 
Castle esplanade, in full knowledge that she would thereby expose her to the noise 
that was generated by the Edinburgh Military Tattoo, had consented to the nuisance. 
Again, in Miller v Jackson82 the majority of the Court of Appeal held that it was no 
defence in a nuisance action that the claimants, by deciding to live in close proximity 
to a cricket pitch in the knowledge that by so doing would expose themselves to the 
risk of being hit by cricket balls, had thereby consented to the risk. The principle 
that coming to a nuisance was not a defence that was recognised by the English 
courts was endorsed by the Supreme Court in Lawrence83 where it was held that the 
fact that the claimants had decided to live in close proximity to a stadium and race 
track where motor sports took place, did not provide the defendant occupiers of the 
premises with a defence in a nuisance action that the claimants brought against them 
in relation to the noise that emanated from the premises.
REMEDIES
In order to raise an action in nuisance, the claimant requires possessing a proprietary 
interest in the land that is affected by the nuisance. Therefore, someone who simply 
resides in the premises affected by the nuisance cannot successfully raise an action 
against the author of the nuisance.84
The remedies of damages, declaration/declarator (Scot) and injunction/interdict 
(Scot), which are of general applicability in the law of tort/delict (Scot), apply, of 
course, to actions which are brought in nuisance. However, a discussion of these 
remedies is outwith the scope of this book.85

Chapter 5
Statutory Nuisance
INTRODUCTION
In the last chapter we discussed how an individual, who is adversely affected inter 
alia, by noise can invoke the law of nuisance in order to secure redress. However, 
common law nuisance as a means of securing the abatement of an alleged nuisance 
has pronounced limitations. First, in order to successfully raise an action in nuisance 
the claimant is required to have a proprietary interest in the land that is adversely 
affected.1
 Furthermore, the cost of an individual taking action at common law has 
the obvious effect of discouraging recourse by way of such an action. 
In this chapter we look at the subject of statutory nuisance, which represents 
the oldest branch of modern environmental law. Statutory nuisance has its origins 
in the mid-nineteenth century, when it was widely believed that cholera was 
spread amongst the population by foul odours, or miasms, that emanated from foul 
matter.2
 Cholera was a shocking disease. Victims of the disease suffered from high 
temperature, severe abdominal pain, vomiting and explosive diarrhoea that left the 
patient severely dehydrated. The upshot of this was that those who had recently died 
of cholera were skeletal in appearance.
The opposing theory as to the transmission of disease was the contagion theory. 
However, until germs were discovered by Pasteur and Lister, the contagionist’s theory 
lacked credibility, simply because there was no scientific foundation to which their 
theory could attach. 
However, the miasmatists were in the majority in the government. The views of this 
majority, therefore, shaped the content of the legislation that was intended to strike 
against the cholera threat. The statutes that were passed were, therefore, ‘nuisance￾based’, that is to say that the main purport of the legislation was to eradicate the 
perceived causes of the environmental threat.3
 Public health legislation continued to 
employ the law of nuisance as a remedial device. For example, the Public Health Acts 
1875 and 1936 employed the concept of statutory nuisance to deal with a range of 
adverse environmental circumstances. In Scotland the Public Health (Scotland) Act 
1867 and 1897 (both repealed) contained similar provisions. The statutory nuisance 
provisions contained in these statutes are now contained, in a more expanded form,

 which we now 
discuss with particular relevance to noise.
STATUTORY NUISANCES
Section 79(1) of the EPA designates a variety of adverse environmental circumstances 
a nuisance.
Premises
As we have already observed, the origins of the provisions of the EPA derive from the 
mid-Victorian era. An outstanding problem during that period was poor, insanitary 
housing conditions. Perforce, public health legislation had to strike at this problem 
by making such premises a statutory nuisance.
Under s 79(1)(a) of the EPA ‘any premises5
 in such a state as to be prejudicial to 
health or a nuisance’ rank as a statutory nuisance and, therefore, fall to be dealt with 
in terms of the EPA. The subsection comprises two quite separate limbs, namely:
(a) premises which are prejudicial to health, and
(b) premises which are a nuisance.6
Therefore, in order to rank as a statutory nuisance, the relevant premises must either 
be prejudicial to health, or a nuisance, or both.7
‘Prejudicial to health’
As far as premises that are prejudicial to health are concerned, it is the state of 
the premises as opposed to the user (or use) to which the premises are put that 
constitutes the relevant proscribed state of affairs.8
 In order that the relevant 
premises is prejudicial to health, in terms of s 79(1)(a), there must be some intrinsic 
feature or attribute of the premises that renders it prejudicial to health. That is, it 
is insufficient that the layout of the premises is unsatisfactory. The leading case is 
the House of Lords case of Oakley v Birmingham City Council.
9
 In that case the 
ground floor of a house included a bathroom with a washbasin, which was situated 
next to a kitchen that had a sink. On the side of the kitchen that was opposite the 
bathroom was a door that led to a lavatory. There was no washbasin in the lavatory. 
Furthermore, there was no space to install a washbasin. Therefore, anyone using the 
toilet who wished to wash their hands would require to do so in the kitchen sink or, 
alternatively, would require to go through the kitchen into the bathroom. The House 
4 The EPA applies to England, Scotland and Wales. The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 
(Northern Ireland) 2011 provides for a statutory nuisance regime similar to that applying to the rest of 
the UK.
5 ‘Premises’ includes land and any vessel (with the exception of a steam vessel) (s 79(7)).

Lambeth [2006] Env LR 33, NCB v Thorne [1976] 1 WLR 543, Robb v Dundee City Council 2002 SC

Statutory Nuisance
held that the premises were not prejudicial to health in terms of s 79(1)(a). It was 
not sufficient that the premises were conducive to unhygienic practices on the part 
of persons who resided in the house. The risk to health had to derive from some 
source of possible infection or disease or illness, such as dampness, mould, dirt or 
evil smelling accumulations or the presence of rats.10 The state of the house itself 
required to be prejudicial to health. In order to rank as premises that are prejudicial 
to health it is not sufficient that the relevant state of affairs interferes with personal 
comfort. Rather, the premises must cause injury to health.11 The state of the premises 
may be prejudicial to the health of both occupiers of the premises, as well as that of 
the general public.12
The substantive issue that was required to be addressed in the divisional court case 
of Vella v London Borough of Lambeth13 was whether noise that was created outwith 
a house, and adversely affected the health of an occupant, could rank as a statutory 
nuisance in terms of the EPA. In that case, the occupant of a house (‘V’) that was 
situated in a block of local authority flats brought an action under s 82 of the EPA 
against the local authority, on the basis that the sound insulation of the premises was 
so poor that V was adversely affected by the noise his neighbour, who lived in the 
flat above, was making simply by the conduct of the neighbour’s everyday activities. 
V also claimed that he was further affected by noise made in the communal hallway 
and stairs. V’s mental health had suffered as a result of being exposed to such noise. 
V claimed that the premises in question (that is to say, either the flat above or his 
own flat) were prejudicial to health in terms of s 79(1)(a) of the EPA. However, the 
court held that the premises were not a statutory nuisance, in terms of the section, 
on the grounds that the statutory nuisance provisions that were contained in the 
predecessors to the EPA, including the various Nuisance Removal Acts, were aimed 
at suppressing disease from insanitary, filthy or verminous premises. In short, s 79(1)
(a) was not aimed at the state of affairs that was the subject matter of the action, 
namely noise caused by premises that were poorly insulated.
Vella should be contrasted with Southwark LBC v Ince.
14 In that case, tenants of 
a local authority brought an action against their local authority landlords under s 99 
of the Public Health Act 1936, on the grounds that the premises were prejudicial 
to health, in terms of s 92,15 by virtue of having poor sound insulation, as a result of 
which the tenants were exposed to noise from road and rail traffic running near the 
building. The divisional court held that the premises were prejudicial to health on 
those grounds. However, Ince was decided before both Oakley and Vella and in the 
author’s’ opinion, Ince no longer represents good law. In short, lack of adequate sound 
insulation in premises does not render the premises prejudicial to health in terms of 
s 79(1)(a).

48
Whether the premises are prejudicial to health is assessed objectively. That is to 
say, one is required to assess whether the premises would pose a risk to the health 
of an ordinary person, in contrast to the health of the residents of the relevant 
premises.16
‘Nuisance’
As far as the meaning of ‘nuisance’ in terms of s 79(1)(a) of the EPA, unlike the 
position at common law the state of affairs that gives rise to the nuisance may exist 
within the premises that is adversely affected.17 However, the impact of the relevant 
state of affairs must be similar to that which ranks as a common law nuisance in 
order to rank as a ‘nuisance’ in terms of s 79(1)(a).18
‘Noise’
Under s 79(1)(g) of the EPA noise19 emitted from premises so as to be prejudicial 
to health or a nuisance, ranks as a statutory nuisance that falls to be dealt with under 
the provisions of the EPA.20
However, the general utility of the paragraph, as far as the suppression of noise is 
concerned, is circumscribed by the fact that the relevant noise is required to emanate 
from premises.21 Noise that emanates from the streets and other public places would 
not, therefore, normally fall within the meaning of the section. It is not necessary 
for the relevant local authority to prove that a specific individual is affected by the 
relevant noise.22 Furthermore, it is sufficient for the prosecution to rely solely on 
evidence submitted by those who are affected by the noise, including expert evidence, 
to prove the existence of the nuisance.23 There is also no requirement that scientific 
evidence is presented to the court.24 Indeed, it is open to the court to lay greater store 
by the non-technical evidence of witnesses to that presented by experts.25 However, 
the court is not bound to uncritically accept the opinion of a witnesses, including 
an expert witness.26 The court must decide on the whole of the evidence whether 
a noise nuisance exists. A subjective judgement is involved in that determination. 
Furthermore, the judgement is that of the court.

Statutory Nuisance
The courts give the expression ‘nuisance’, as used in the subsection, its ordinary 
common law meaning.27 In other words, when a court has to determine if a given 
state of affairs constitutes a nuisance, in terms of s 79(1)(g), the court takes into 
account the same factors as those which were discussed above.28 It is not necessary 
that a particular noise level requires to be exceeded before a nuisance in terms 
of s 79(1)(g) can be said to exist.29 It is also sufficient that the noise in question 
derives from a one-off event.30 While locality is an important factor to be taken 
into account31 in determining whether a nuisance exists, if the noise in question 
has the capacity to annoy a reasonable person, the noise can rank as a statutory 
nuisance, notwithstanding the fact that the noise is no louder than other noises in 
the locality.32
In order to constitute a nuisance under s 79(1)(g) the noise requires to be of such 
intensity, duration, etc. as to constitute a nuisance at common law.33
We have already observed, in our discussion on the impact of planning law on 
the development common law nuisance, that in the Supreme Court case of Lawrence 
v Fen Tigers Ltd34 (where the court was required to decide whether noise from the 
defendants’ premises ranked as a nuisance at common law) the court was of the 
opinion that whereas the grant of planning permission could not sanction a nuisance 
and, furthermore, was normally of no relevance when one was deciding if a nuisance 
existed, in certain circumstances the fact that the relevant planning authority had 
granted planning permission could be accorded some importance in determining 
whether the noise in question was unreasonably loud and, therefore, constituted a 
nuisance. 
In the sheriff court case of Milne v Stuartfield Windpower Ltd,
35 the sheriff was of 
the opinion that the fact that the defender’s wind turbine had been granted planning 
permission was of some relevance in determining whether the noise in question 
ranked as statutory nuisance in terms of s 79(1)(g).36
Vehicle noise
Under s 79(1)(ga) noise that is prejudicial to health, or a nuisance, and is emitted 
from or caused by a vehicle, machinery or equipment37 in a street (or, in Scotland, 
a road) ranks as a statutory nuisance. It is important to note that subsection s 79(1)
(ga) simply relates to noise from individual vehicles, machinery or equipment. 
The subsection does not apply to noise made by traffic; by any naval or military or

air force of the Crown; or by a visiting force; or by a political demonstration or a 
demonstration supporting or opposing a cause or campaign.38
The subsection would cover a variety of different noise sources, including noise 
from car radios, diesel generators and parked refrigerator vehicles in the street.
Statutory nuisances and the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999
A local authority may not institute summary nuisance proceedings under Part III of 
the EPA, in relation to a nuisance falling inter alia under s 79(1)(g) and, in Scotland, 
also under s 79(1)(ga), without the consent of the Secretary of State (or, in Scotland, 
the Scottish Ministers) if proceedings in respect of that nuisance might have been 
instituted under s 2 of the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999.39 The rationale 
for this provision is to avoid regulatory duplication, in that the Environment Agency 
(and, in Scotland, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency) regulate the range 
of installations that fall to be regulated in terms of the regulations that have been 
made under s 2.40
Duty of local authority to inspect area
A local authority is under a duty to inspect its area, from time to time, to detect 
any statutory nuisances which ought to be dealt with under ss 80 and 80A of the 
EPA.41 Where a complaint of a statutory nuisance is made to it by a person living 
within its area, the local authority is placed under a duty to take such steps as are 
reasonably practicable to investigate the complaint. However, in actual practice, a 
local authority does not systematically inspect its area to ascertain the presence of 
nuisances. Rather, local authorities simply react to complaints from members of the 
public. In short, the statutory nuisance regime is one that is largely, if not entirely, 
complaints-driven. In this context, it is pertinent to note that the EPA does not 
specify precisely what steps a local authority requires to take in order to investigate 
a complaint. There is no obligation on part of the local authority to either visit the 
relevant locus or communicate in any way with the complainant, or any person (if 
any) who is alleged to be responsible for the reputed nuisance. Furthermore, the 
EPA does not specify the form that the complaint should take. It would seem, 
therefore, that a complaint could be made to by means of email, phone call, fax, 
letter or verbal. 
Summary proceedings for statutory nuisances
The procedure for the abatement of statutory nuisances has hardly changed since 
the inception of the statutory nuisance regime in the 1840s. We now discuss the 
procedure under the EPA.
38 EPA s 79(6A). 39 EPA s 79(10). 40 See the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016 (SI 2016/1154) (as 
amended) or in Scotland the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2012 
(SSI 2012/360) (as amended). 41 EPA s 79(1). 51
Statutory Nuisance
Where a local authority is satisfied that a statutory nuisance exists, or is likely to 
occur or recur, in the area of the local authority, it is required to serve an abatement 
notice, which imposes all or any of the following requirements:
(a) requiring the abatement of the nuisance or prohibiting or restricting its 
occurrence or recurrence; and
(b) requiring the execution of such works, and the taking of such other steps, as 
may be necessary for any of those purposes.42
The notice is required to specify the time, or times, within which there must be 
compliance with the notice.
Once the local authority has decided that a nuisance exists, the local authority 
must serve an abatement notice. In other words, the local authority has no discretion. 
It has a mandatory duty to do so.43 Furthermore, there is no requirement that the 
local authority should consult with the person who is responsible for the nuisance, 
prior to serving the notice.44
Person on whom the notice is to be served
The abatement notice is required to be served on the person who is responsible for 
the nuisance, unless the nuisance arises from a defect of a structural character, in 
which case the notice requires to be served on the owner of the premises.45 The 
abatement notice must be served on the owner or occupier of the premises if either 
the person responsible cannot be found or the nuisance has not yet occurred. The EPA 
defines the expression ‘person responsible’ as the person through whose act, default 
or sufferance the nuisance is attributable.46 The words ‘act,’ ‘default’ and ‘sufferance’ 
have tended to be construed conjunctively by the courts. That is, the words have been 
given a similar meaning.47 However, the words, ‘act’ ‘default’ and ‘sufferance’ have 
separate and distinct meanings. The word ‘act’ bears its everyday meaning. The words 
‘default’ and ‘sufferance’ are now briefly discussed.
‘Default’
The word ‘default’ simply means not doing what it is reasonable to do under the 
circumstances.48 One can be in default in terms of the EPA, notwithstanding the 
fact that the relevant adverse state of affairs has arisen wholly, or partly, by a third 
42 EPA s 80(1). 43 R v Carrick DC ex p Shelley [1996] Env LR 273. 44 R v Falmouth and Truro Port Health Authority ex p South West Water Services [2001] QB 445. 45 EPA s 80(2) The expression ‘owner’ is not defined in the EPA. However, in Camden LBC v Gunby it 
was held that the expression ‘owner’ of the premises, in terms of s 80(2) was the person who received 
the rack rent of the premises, regardless of whether that person was acting as an agent or a trustee for 
any person. 46 EPA s 79(7). In relation to a vehicle, includes the person whose name the vehicle is for the time being 
registered under the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994 and any other person who is for the 
time being the driver of the vehicle. In relation to machinery or equipment, includes any person who 
is for the time being operator of the machinery or equipment. 47 See e.g. Robb v Dundee City Council 2002 SC 301; Network Housing Association v Westminster City 
Council [1995] Env 176; 48 Re Young & Harston’s Contract (1885) 31 Ch D 168 at 174 (per Bowen LJ).NOISE AND NOISE LAW
52
party being wholly or partly in default of their legal obligations, including statutory 
obligations.49
‘Sufferance’
One suffers an adverse state of affairs if one is in a position in which one can both 
physically, and legally, put an end to the state of affairs that constitutes a nuisance 
but, nonetheless, one fails to do so.
50 Furthermore, for one to suffer a nuisance, one is 
required to either have had either actual or constructive knowledge of its existence.51
Defect of a structural character 
We have already observed above, that if the nuisance arises from a defect of a 
structural character, the abatement notice is required to be served on the owner of 
the relevant premises.
In the sheriff court case of Pettigrew v Inverclyde Council52 it was held that defects 
in the sound insulation of a house could rank as defects of a structural character in 
terms of s 80(2). In the sheriff court case of Anderson v City of Dundee Council53 it 
was held that the expression ‘defect of a structural character’ implied that the existing 
state of the building should be different from what was originally designed. However, 
the fact that the building, in its present form, did not suit its purpose in the way it 
did thirty years ago, did not mean that it was structurally defective. Furthermore, in 
deciding the building’s original purpose, the court took into account the relevant 
building standards of the time.
The Inner House had the opportunity to discuss the meaning of ‘defect of a 
structural character’ in Robb v Dundee City Council54 Lord Johnson was of the 
opinion that, whereas lack of insulation was part of the structure of a building it did 
not rank as a structural defect in terms of the EPA.55 In her dissenting judgement, 
Lady Paton56 was of the opinion that the expression ‘defect of a structural character’ 
could cover situations where there existed a defect that did not threaten the structural 
integrity of the building but, nonetheless, arose from the manner in which, or the 
materials from which, the premises were built.
Noise nuisances
In England, where a local authority is satisfied that a statutory nuisance falling within 
s 79(1)(g) exists or is likely to occur or recur in the area of the authority, it is either 
required to serve an abatement notice in accordance with s 80(1), (2) or take such 
other steps as it thinks appropriate for the purpose of persuading the appropriate 
person to abate the nuisance, or prohibit or restrict its occurrence or recurrence.57 If

The relationship between the statutory nuisance abatement procedure under the EPA 53
Statutory Nuisance
the local authority has taken such other steps and either of the following conditions 
are satisfied, the local authority is required to serve an abatement notice in respect of 
the nuisance.58 The conditions are:
(a) that the authority is satisfied that before the end of the relevant period the 
steps taken will not be successful in persuading the appropriate person59 to 
abate the nuisance or prohibit or restrict its occurrence or recurrence;
(b) that the authority is satisfied that at the end of the relevant period60 the 
nuisance continues to exist, or continues to occur or recur in the area of the 
authority.61
Street noise
In the case of a statutory nuisance that falls within s 79(1)(ga) which; (a) has not 
yet occurred; or (b) arises from noise emitted or caused by an unattended vehicle 
or unattended machinery or equipment, the abatement notice requires to be served 
in the following manner62: where the person responsible for the vehicle machinery 
or equipment can be found, on that person63; where that person cannot be found, 
or where the local authority so determines, by fixing the notice to the vehicle, 
equipment or machinery. In such circumstances, if the person responsible for the 
vehicle, machinery or equipment can be found, and served with a notice within an 
hour of the notice being fixed to the vehicle, machinery or equipment, a copy requires 
to be served on that person accordingly.64 Where an abatement notice is served 
under s 80A(2)(b) by virtue of a determination of the relevant local authority, the 
notice is required to state that if a copy is served under s 80A(3) the time specified 
in the notice within which the requirements are to be complied with is extended 
by such further period as is specified in the notice.65 Where an abatement notice 
is served in accordance with s  80A(2)(b) the person responsible for the vehicle, 
machinery or equipment may appeal against the notice under s  80(3) as if they 
had been served with the notice on the day on which it was fixed to the vehicle, 
machinery or equipment.66 Section 80A(4) applies in relation to a person on whom 
a notice is served under s 80A(3) as if the copy of the notice was the notice itself.67
A person who removes or interferes with a notice that is fixed to a vehicle, machinery 
or equipment in accordance with s 80A(2)(b) commits an offence, unless they are the 
person responsible for the vehicle machinery or equipment, or they do so with the 
and the provisions of the Equality Act 2010 and also Human Rights Act 1998 were discussed in

consent of that person.68 Such a person is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine 
not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.69
Content of abatement notice
The EPA does not prescribe the precise content of the abatement notice. However, 
where an appeal against a notice, which has been served under s  80, lies to a 
magistrates’ court or, in Scotland, to the sheriff, the notice is required to contain a 
statement that such an appeal lies and also specify the time within which it must 
be brought.70 Furthermore, the terms of the notice must be clear, precise, practical, 
reasonable and certain.71 The notice must also be proportionate in terms of the ends 
that are to be achieved, and also enforceable.72 The abatement notice can be worded 
to take immediate effect.73 Furthermore, the notice must make clear to the person 
on whom the notice is served what is wrong.74 However, in determining whether 
the notice is sufficiently clear, one can take into account certain external factors 
into account. For example, the content of an accompanying letter can be taken into 
account.75 Furthermore, the abatement notice need not specify whether that which is 
the subject matter of the notice is either prejudicial to health or a nuisance.76 Rather, 
it suffices that the person on whom the notice is served knows what is required to be 
done in order to abate the nuisance.
The local authority can simply require the recipient of the notice to abate the 
nuisance. That is to say that the authority need not specify the measures that are 
required to be taken in order to abate the nuisance.77 The local authority can simply 
leave it up to the perpetrator of the nuisance to choose the mode of abatement of 
the nuisance. However, in Budd v Colchester BC78 Swinton Thomas LJ stated obiter
that there could be certain cases where a duty lay on the authority to specify the 
works or steps that were required to be taken in the abatement notice. If the relevant 
notice requires works or other steps to be carried out, the relevant measures must be 
specified.79
If the abatement notice concerns noise nuisance, the local authority need not

Statutory Nuisance
the noise.80 Nor is there a requirement that the notice should specify the activities 
that are the subject matter of the notice.81 However, the person on whom the notice 
is served must be made aware of the nature of the relevant nuisance, for example, 
smell or noise.82
However, if the abatement notice specifies the levels of noise that must not be 
exceeded, the method of ascertaining (or measuring) whether such levels are being 
exceeded, and where the relevant noise readings should be taken, must be specified.83
Finally, in order to ascertain the validity of an abatement notice, one is required 
to look objectively at its substance.84
The relevant date by means of which one determines whether the relevant state 
of affairs is a statutory nuisance is on the date of the relevant trial, as opposed to the 
date on which court proceedings were begun.85
Time for compliance
The abatement notice can be framed in such a way that it has immediate effect.86
Furthermore, if the abatement notice simply prohibits the recurrence the nuisance, 
it is not required to specify the period of time at the end of which the notice expires. 
That is to say that the notice continues indefinitely.87
Appeals against notice
A person on whom a notice is served may appeal against the notice to a magistrates’ 
court or, in Scotland, to the sheriff within a period of twenty-one days, beginning 
with the date on which they were served with the notice.88 The Statutory Nuisance 
(Appeals) Regulations 199589 and, as far as Scotland is concerned, the Statutory 
Nuisance (Appeals) (Scotland) Regulations 199690 specify, inter alia, the grounds on 
which an appeal may be made.
Failure to comply with abatement notice
It is an offence for the person on whom an abatement notice is served to fail, 
without reasonable excuse, to comply with any requirement or prohibition that is 
imposed by the notice.91 In Wellingborough BC v Gordon92 it was held that having 
a birthday party did not provide the defendant with a reasonable excuse for the 
80 R v Fenny Stratford Justices [1976] 1 WLR 1101. See also R (Elvington Park Ltd) v York Crown Court
[2011] EWHC 2213.

defendant’s breach of a noise nuisance notice, in terms of s 58(4) of the Control 
of Pollution Act 1974.93 However, in Hope Butuyuyu v Hammersmith and Fulham 
LBC94 it was held that it was not possible to provide a comprehensive definition 
of what matters either were, or were not, capable of amounting to a reasonable 
excuse for failing to comply with an abatement notice. The relevant circumstances 
would vary from case to case. In Hope the court considered it relevant to take into 
account the illnesses of both the defendant and her son. Hope, therefore, is authority 
for the proposition that the court can take subjective factors into account when 
determining what circumstances constitute a reasonable excuse in terms of s 80(4) 
of the EPA. In the divisional court case of Waltham Forest LBC v Mitoo95 it was held 
that the playing of loud music by the person on whom an abatement notice had 
been served, in order to drown out noise from construction works, did not rank as a 
reasonable excuse.
Penalties, etc.
Other than in a case concerning industrial or trade premises, a person who commits 
an offence under s 80(4) is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level 
5 on the standard scale, together with a further fine of an amount of a tenth of the 
greater of £5,000 or level 4 on the standard scale, for each day on which the offence 
continues after the conviction.96 A person who commits an offence under s 80(4) on 
industrial, trade or business premises is liable, on summary conviction, to a fine.97
In Scotland, where a local authority has reason to believe that a person has 
committed an offence under s 80(4) the local authority may give that person a fixed 
penalty notice under s 80ZA, offering the person the opportunity of discharging any 
liability to conviction for that offence, by payment of a fixed penalty.98 A person who 
commits an offence under s 80(4) on industrial, trade or business premises is liable, 
on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £40,000.99
Defence of best practicable means 
The EPA makes provision for the defence of best practicable means100 in relation 
to proceedings by a local authority for failure to comply with an abatement notice. 
Subject to certain exceptions, in any proceedings for an offence under s  80(4) in 
respect of a statutory nuisance it is a defence to prove that the best practicable means 
were used to prevent or to counteract the effects of a nuisance.101 However, the 
defence is not available inter alia under s 79(1)(g) except where the nuisance arises 
on industrial, trade or business premises.102 Nor is the defence available in relation

Statutory Nuisance
to noise that is emitted from, or caused by a vehicle, machinery or equipment, unless 
used for industrial, trade or business purposes.103
Noise nuisance – construction sites, etc.
In proceedings for an offence under s 80(4) in relation to a statutory nuisance falling 
within s 79(1)(g) or (ga), where the offence consists of contravening the requirements 
imposed by s 80(1)(a) (that is, the requirement imposed by an abatement notice, 
requiring the abatement of a nuisance, or prohibiting its occurrence or recurrence) 
it is a defence to prove that the alleged offence was covered by a notice served under 
s 60 or a consent given under s 61 or s 65 (construction sites) of the Control of 
Pollution Act 1974 (COPA).104 The EPA also provides a defence105 in relation to an 
alleged offence that was committed at a time when the premises were subject to a 
notice under s 66106 (noise reduction notice) of COPA if it can be proved that the 
level of noise emitted from the premises, at that time, was not such as to constitute a 
contravention of the notice under that section. The EPA provides a further defence107
where the alleged offence occurred at a time when the premises were not subject 
to a notice under s 66 of COPA, and when a level fixed under s 67108 of COPA 
(new buildings liable to an abatement order) was applied to the premises, if it can 
be proved that the level of noise emitted from the premises, at that time, did not 
exceed that level. The defences under s 80(9) relating to ss 66 and 67 of COPA apply, 
irrespective of whether or not the relevant notice was subject to an appeal at the time 
when the offence was alleged to have been committed.109
More than one person responsible
Under s 81(1) of the EPA where more than one person is responsible for a statutory 
nuisance, summary proceedings under s 80 can be taken against any such person, 
whether or not what any one of them is responsible for would, by itself, amount to 
a nuisance. In effect, this replicates a common law principle that if one creates an 
adverse state of affairs (e.g. noise) that of itself would not constitute a nuisance but 
in combination with another source of noise would rank as a nuisance, that person 
would be liable.
In relation to a statutory nuisance falling within s  79(1)(ga) (i.e. noise from 
vehicles, machinery, equipment) for which more than one person is responsible 
(whether or not what any one of those persons is responsible for would in itself 
amount to a nuisance) the relevant abatement notice can be served on any such 
person.110
Similarly, as far as a statutory nuisance falling within s 79(1)(ga) that is caused 
by, or emitted from, an unattended vehicle, or unattended machinery or equipment, 
103 EPA s 80(8)(aa). 104 EPA s 80(9). 105 EPA s 80(9), this defence does not apply in Scotland. 106 Repealed. 107 This defence does not apply in Scotland. 108 Repealed. 109 EPA s 80(10). 110 EPA s 81(1A).NOISE AND NOISE LAW

for which more than one person is responsible, the relevant notice can be served on 
any such person.111
Non-compliance with an abatement notice
Where an abatement notice has not been complied with the local authority may, 
whether or not they take proceedings under s  80(4),112 abate the nuisance and 
do whatever may be necessary in execution of the notice.113 In Scotland the local 
authority can also abate the nuisance and take any necessary action, in circumstances 
where a fixed penalty notice has been given under s 80(4A) regardless of whether or 
not the fixed penalty notice is accepted. Furthermore, where the matter to be abated 
is a statutory nuisance under s 79(1)(g) the local authority has the power to seize and 
remove any equipment that it appears to the local authority is being used, or has been 
used, in the emission of the noise in question.114 A person who wilfully obstructs a 
person who is acting in terms of s 81(3A), commits an offence and is liable to a fine 
on summary conviction.115
Expenses
Any expenses that are incurred by a local authority in abating or preventing the 
recurrence of a nuisance under s 81(3) may be recovered by it from the person by 
whose act or default the nuisance was caused.116 If the relevant person is the owner 
of the premises, expenses can be recovered from any person who is for the time 
being the owner. In such circumstances, the court117 may apportion expenses between 
persons whose acts or defaults the nuisance is caused, in such a manner as the court 
or sheriff considers fair or reasonable.118
Proceedings by local authorities
If a local authority is of the opinion that proceedings for an offence under s 80(4) 
would provide an inadequate remedy in the case of any statutory nuisance, the 
local authority may take proceedings in the High Court or, in Scotland, a court of 
competent jurisdiction, for the purposes of securing the abatement, prohibition or 
restriction of the nuisance.119 In such circumstances, the local authority need not 
have suffered any damage from the nuisance. 
In any proceedings that relate to a statutory nuisance under s 79(1)(g) or (1)
(ga) it is a defence to prove that the noise was authorised by a notice under s 60 or a 
consent under s 61 (construction sites) of COPA.120

equipment seized under s 81(3)(A) of the EPA as it does in relation to equipment that is seized under 
s 47(2) of the 2004 Act: s 81(3C). 116 EPA s 81(4). 117 In Scotland, the sheriff. 118 EPA s 81(4). 119 EPA s 81(5). 120 EPA s 81(6).59
Statutory Nuisance
Further supplementary proceedings under Schedule 3 of the EPA apply to any 
such proceedings.121
Before taking such proceedings, the local authority is required to conclude 
that the statutory nuisance proceedings would afford an inadequate, as opposed 
to a less convenient remedy, in the circumstances.122 Furthermore, in reaching that 
conclusion, the local authority is required to address the statutory procedure for 
dealing with a statutory nuisance, which comprises both consecutive and distinct 
steps.123 That is to say, first, the service of an abatement notice by the local authority 
is required. Second, if there is no compliance with the notice, either enforcement by 
way of prosecution in the magistrates’ court or the use of self-help and cost recovery 
must be attempted by the local authority to secure redress. Third, only as a last resort, 
may the local authority take proceedings in the High Court or a court of competent 
jurisdiction.
SUMMARY PROCEEDINGS BY PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS
The EPA allows a person who is aggrieved by the existence of a statutory nuisance 
to take proceedings in a magistrates’ court, by way of a complaint or, in Scotland, 
before the sheriff, on a summary application.124 In Watkins v Aged Merchant Seaman’s 
Homes125 it was held that a complainant in actual occupation of premises would 
normally, though not necessarily, be a person aggrieved, regardless of whether 
the occupation was lawful. Furthermore, whether the complainant was a ‘person 
aggrieved’ was always a question of fact and degree.
If the magistrates’ court or, in Scotland, the sheriff, is satisfied that the alleged 
nuisance exists, or that although abated it is likely to recur on the same premises, 
or in the case of a nuisance within s 79(1)(ga) in the same street, or, in Scotland, 
road, the court or the sheriff is required to make an order for either or both of the 
following purposes:
(a) requiring the defendant or, in Scotland, the defender, to abate the nuisance, 
within the time specified in the order, and to execute any works necessary for 
that purpose; and
(b) prohibiting a recurrence of the nuisance, and requiring the defendant, 
or defender, within the time specified in the order, to execute any works 
necessary to prevent the recurrence.126
In England and Wales, a fine, not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, may be 
imposed on the defendant.
If the magistrates’ court or the sheriff is satisfied that the alleged nuisance exists 
and is such as, in the opinion of the court or the sheriff, to render the premises unfit 
for human habitation an order under s 82(2) may prohibit the use of the premises for

60
human habitation until the premises are to the satisfaction of the court or the sheriff, 
rendered fit for that purpose.127
Proceedings require to be brought against the party who is responsible for the 
nuisance.128 However, where the nuisance arises from any defect of a structural 
character, proceedings require to be brought against the owner of the premises. 
If the person responsible for the nuisance cannot be found, proceedings must be 
brought against the owner or occupier of the premises. In the case of a statutory 
nuisance falling within s 79(1)(ga) that is caused by noise emitted from or caused 
by an unattended vehicle, or unattended machinery or equipment, proceedings must 
be brought against the person responsible for the vehicle or equipment. Where 
more than one person is responsible for a statutory nuisance, s 82(1)–(4) inclusive of 
the EPA applies to each of those persons, whether or not what any one of them is 
responsible for would by itself amount to a nuisance.129
In relation to a statutory nuisance falling within s  79(1)(ga) for which more 
than one person is responsible (whether or not what any one of those persons is 
responsible for would not amount to a nuisance) proceedings require to be brought 
against each person responsible for the nuisance who can be found.130 As far as a 
statutory nuisance falling within s 79(1)(ga) that is caused by noise emitted from or 
caused by an unattended vehicle or unattended machinery or equipment for which 
more than one person is responsible, proceedings require to be brought against each 
person responsible for the vehicle.
Prior to instituting proceedings under s 82(2) the person who is aggrieved by 
the nuisance is required to give the person responsible for the nuisance notice in 
writing of their intention to bring the relevant proceedings.131 The notice is required 
to state the subject matter of the complaint. At least three days’ notice of bringing the 
proceedings must be given in relation to statutory nuisances that fall within s 79(1)
(g) and s 79(1)(ga).132 In the case of other nuisances, not less than twenty one days’ 
notice must be given.
A person who, without reasonable excuse, contravenes any provision that is 
imposed by an order under s 82(2) is guilty of an offence and liable on summary 
conviction to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, together with a 
further fine of an amount equal to a tenth of the greater of £5,000 or level 4 on the 
standard scale, for each day on which the offence continues after the conviction.133
In Scotland a person guilty of the offence is liable on summary conviction, to a fine 
not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, together with a further fine of an amount 
equal to one tenth of that level for each day on which the offence continues after the 
conviction.
As is the case in respect of an abatement notice that is served by a local authority, 
subject to certain exceptions, the defence of best practicable means applies in relation 
127 EPA s 82(3). 128 EPA s 82(4). 129 EPA s 82(5). 130 EPA s 82(5A). 131 EPA s 82(6). 132 EPA s 82(7). 133 EPA s 82(8).61
Statutory Nuisance
to proceedings that are brought by a private individual.134 As far as noise nuisance 
is concerned, the defence is not available in relation to s 79(1)(g) except where the 
noise arises on industrial trade or business premises.135 Nor is the defence available in 
relation to s 79(1)(ga) except where the noise is emitted from or caused by a vehicle 
machinery or equipment being used for industrial, trade or business purposes.
If a person is convicted of an offence under s 82(8), a magistrates’ court or the 
sheriff may, after giving the local authority in whose area the nuisance has occurred 
an opportunity of being heard, direct the local authority to do anything the person 
convicted was required to do by the order to which the conviction relates.136 Where 
it is proved that the alleged nuisance existed at the date of the making of the 
complaint, or summary application, then whether or not at the date of the hearing 
it still exists, or is likely to recur, the court or the sheriff is required to order the 
defendant or defender (or defendants or defenders in such proportions as appears 
fair and reasonable) to pay the person bringing the proceedings such amount as the 
court or the sheriff considers reasonably sufficient to compensate the person for any 
expenses that were properly incurred by them in the proceedings.137 However, if it 
appears to the magistrates’ court or the sheriff that neither the person responsible for 
the nuisance, nor the owner or occupier of the premises or (as the case may be) the 
person responsible for the vehicle, machinery or equipment, can be found, the court 
or the sheriff may, after giving the local authority in whose area the nuisance has 
occurred an opportunity of being heard, direct the authority to anything which the 
court or the sheriff would have ordered that person to do.138

Chapter 6
Neighbourhood Noise
INTRODUCTION
In this chapter we look at how noise from a wide range of sources and activities, 
which impact on the community, is controlled. This represents a fragmented area of 
the law indeed. The legislation relating to neighbourhood noise is piecemeal and is 
illustrative, perhaps, of the very nature of noise.
CONSTRUCTION SITE NOISE
Noise from construction sites presents a potential problem for those living in close 
proximity to the site in question. The noise from construction sites is normally 
generated by the carrying out of building operations (ranging from pile driving to 
demolition work) or by site traffic. Construction site noise in general may justifiably 
prompt complaints from those living in close proximity to the site for two main 
reasons. First, those living in close proximity to the site are not habituated to the 
noise in question, by virtue of the fact that duration of a construction project is 
normally comparatively quite short. Second, individuals tend to be more easily 
annoyed by intermittent noise, which is associated with building sites, than noise that 
emanates from a long-established source such as a factory. Noise from construction 
sites, therefore, warrants special legislative attention.
Section 60 of the Control of Pollution Act 1974 (COPA) gives local authorities 
extensive power to deal with noise from construction sites. The section applies to:
(a) the erection, construction, alteration, repair or maintenance of buildings, 
structures or roads;
(b) breaking up, opening or boring under any road or adjacent land, in connection 
with the construction, inspection, maintenance or removal of works;
(c) demolition or dredging work; and
(d) (whether or not also comprised in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) above) any work 
of engineering construction.1
Section 60(2) empowers a local authority to serve a notice that imposes requirements 
as to the way in which the relevant works are either being carried out or are going to 
be carried out on any premises.2
 The local authority may also publish notice of the 
1 COPA s 60(1).
2 COPA s 60(2).

requirements in such a way as it appears to the authority to be appropriate. The terms 
that the local authority can stipulate are required to be both practicable and precise.3
If the notice simply relates to works that are taking place when the notice is served, 
the notice is ineffective in relation to noise that emanates from work that, at that 
time, is not within the contemplation of the local authority.4
 In short, subsequent 
work would not be covered by the notice. However, there is no requirement that the 
local authority be in possession of definitive information as to the precise nature of 
the operations taking place on the site before the authority can lawfully serve a notice 
under s 60.5
 Furthermore, it must be made clear to the person on whom the notice 
is served that it relates to a specific area of land.6
Section 60(3) provides that the local authority may, in particular, specify the plant 
or machinery that is, or is not, to be used, and also specify the hours during which 
the works may be carried out and the level of noise that may be emitted from the 
premises in question, or at any specified point on those premises, or that may be 
so emitted during specified hours. The notice may also provide for any change of 
circumstances.
In Adam (Scotland) Ltd v Bearsden and Milngavie District Council7
 it was held by 
the sheriff that it was legitimate for a local authority to specify a requirement in the 
appropriate notice that all works that were audible at the site boundary should only 
be carried out between certain hours. There was no justification for the view that the 
‘audibility test’ was objectionable on the basis that it was subjective.8
Under s  60(4) when a local authority acts under the provisions of s  60, the 
authority is required to have regard to both the relevant provisions of any code 
of practice that is issued under Part III of COPA9
 and also to the need to ensure 
that the best practicable means are employed to minimise noise. Before specifying 
any particular methods, or plant or machinery the local authority is required to 
address its mind to the desirability, in the interests of any recipients of the notice 
in question, of specifying other methods or plant or machinery that would be 
substantially as effective in minimising noise and more acceptable to them. 
Finally, the local authority is required to have regard to need to protect persons 
in the locality in which the premises in question are situated from the effects of 
the noise. The terms of the notice require to be both site-specific, reasonable and 
necessary.10 
Under s 65(5) the relevant notice is required to be served on the person who 
appears to the local authority to be carrying out, or going to carry out the works, and 
on any other persons who appear to the local authority to be responsible for, or to 
have control over, the carrying out of the works, as the local authority thinks fit. The 
notice could, therefore, be served on the relevant building contractor as well as the

person who commissioned the works (if they are different persons) such as the owner 
or occupier of the relevant land. 
The notice may specify the time within which the notice is to be complied with 
and may require the person on whom the notice is to be served, to execute such 
works and also take such other steps as may be necessary for the purpose of the 
notice, or as may be specified in the notice.11
The person served with a notice under s 60 may appeal against the notice to the 
magistrates’ court or, in Scotland, to the sheriff, within twenty-one days from the 
service of the notice.12 If a person on whom a notice is served under s 60 contravenes, 
without reasonable excuse, any requirements of the notice, that person commits an 
offence under COPA.13
One can readily see that the prospect of the relevant local authority serving 
notice under s  60 could present a constant threat to a building contractor who 
requires to know, at the outset of the construction operations, how long the building 
operations will last as well as the type of machinery and plant that will be used on 
the site. Section 61(1) therefore, allows a person who intends to carry out building 
operations to apply for consent to carry out the works. If, as normally will be the 
case, the building works require approval or, in Scotland, a warrant in terms of the 
Building (Scotland) Act 2003, the application for consent is required to be made at 
the same time or later than the request for approval under the building regulations 
or, as the case may be, the application for a building warrant under the 2003 Act.14
The application must contain particulars of the works, the method by which they 
are to be carried out and also the steps that are proposed to be taken in order to 
minimise noise that results from the works.15 The local authority is required to give 
its approval to the application if it considers that the application contains sufficient 
information for the purpose and that if the works are carried out in accordance 
with the application, the local authority would not serve notice under s 60.16 When 
considering whether to grant consent, the local authority must address its mind to the 
provisions of s 60 of COPA.17 The local authority have power to attach conditions to 
a consent; limit or qualify a consent; to allow for any change of circumstances; and 
also, limit the duration of the consent. It is made an offence for any person to either 
knowingly carry out works, or permit the works to be carried out, in contravention of 
any conditions that are attached to a consent.
The local authority is required to inform the applicant of its decision within 
twenty-eight days of the receipt of the application.18 The applicant can appeal to the 
magistrates’ court or, in Scotland, the sheriff, against the refusal of a local authority

consent.19 In any proceedings for an offence under s 60(8) it is a defence to prove 
that the alleged contravention amounted to the carrying out of works that were in 
accordance with a consent given under s 61.20 A consent that is given under s 61 is 
required to contain a statement to the effect that such a consent does not, of itself, 
constitute any ground of defence against proceedings that are instituted under s 82 
of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA).21 Finally, where a consent has 
been given under s 61 and the works are carried out by a person (for example, a 
subcontractor) other than the applicant, a duty is imposed on the applicant to take all 
reasonable steps to bring the consent to the notice of that other person.22 A penalty 
is imposed for failure to comply with this requirement.
British Standard 522823 gives recommendations for basic methods of noise 
control relating to construction sites, including sites where demolition remediation 
and ground treatment or related civil engineering work are being carried out, and 
also open sites, where work activities/operations generate significant noise levels, 
including industry-specific guidance. The legislative background to noise control is 
described and recommendations are given regarding procedures for the establishment 
of effective liaison between developers, site operators and local authorities.
LOUDSPEAKERS IN STREETS AND ROADS
Loudspeakers in vehicles have been a problem for a number of years. More recently, 
the problem has worsened by virtue of certain antisocial individuals using powerful 
sound systems in their cars, which are capable of generating great volumes of noise, 
to the discomfort of members of the public. However, Parliament did not consider 
the problem sufficiently serious to warrant legislative attention until 1960, when the 
Noise Abatement Act 1960 (repealed) made special provision for loudspeaker street 
noise. The problem is now dealt with by the Control of Pollution Act 1974. Section 
62(1)(a) makes it an offence to use a loudspeaker in a street24 or, in Scotland, a road, 
between 9pm and 8am the following morning, for any purpose. It is also made an 
offence, under s 62(1)(b) to use a loudspeaker in a street, or road, at any other time for 
the purpose of advertising any trade or business. Power is given to the Secretary of 
State, or in Scotland, the Scottish Ministers, to amend the times specified in s 62(1)
(a) by order.25 However, such an order may not amend the times so as to permit the 
operation of a loudspeaker in a street or road at any time between the hours of 9pm 
in the evening and 8pm in the following morning.26 Section 62(2) exempts from the 
19 COPA s 61(7). 20 COPA s 61(8). 21 COPA s 61(9). 22 COPA s 61(10). 23 British Standard 5228, Code of Practice for noise and vibration control on construction and open sites – 
Part 1: Noise (2009). 24 A street is defined in s 62(1) as a highway and any other road, footway, square or court that is for the 
time being, open to the public. In Westminster City Council v French Connection Retail Ltd [2005] Env 
LR 42 it was held that the outer face of a shop window formed part of a street. Therefore, the window, 
which was being used by the defendant to amplify sound, could rank as a loudspeaker in the relevant 
street. 25 COPA s 62(1A). 26 COPA s 62(1B).67

provisions of s 62(1) certain types of loudspeaker, including those which are used 
by the police, fire and ambulance services. Also exempt is the use of a loudspeaker, 
which is either in or fixed to a vehicle (for example, a loudspeaker that is part of a 
car radio system) and is used solely to entertain or communicate with the driver 
or passenger of the vehicle, or where the loudspeaker either is, or forms part of the 
horn, or similar warning instrument of the vehicle, solely for giving warning to other 
traffic, and is operated as not to give reasonable cause for annoyance to persons in the 
vicinity. Another important exemption, in practical terms, is made in respect of the 
operation of a loudspeaker between noon and pm of the same day, provided that the 
loudspeaker is fixed to a vehicle that is used for the purpose of a sale of a perishable 
commodity (for example, ice cream) for human consumption and is operated so as 
not to give cause for annoyance to persons who are in the vicinity.27 Under s 62(3A) 
power is given to the relevant local authority to give consent to the operation of a 
loudspeaker, in terms of Schedule 2 to the Noise and Statutory Nuisance Act 1993, 
in which case the provisions of s  62(1) do not apply. However, the provisions of 
that schedule only come into effect if the local authority passes a resolution to that 
effect.28
NOISE FROM PLANT AND MACHINERY
Under s  68(1) of COPA the Secretary of State, or the Scottish Ministers, have 
power to make regulations to require the use, either on or in connection with plant 
or machinery, of devices or arrangements for reducing the noise caused by plant 
or machinery. Regulations may also limit the level of noise that may be caused by 
any plant or machinery, when used for works to which s 60 applies, or that may be 
caused outside a factory, within the meaning of the Factories Act 1961, by the use 
of the plant or machinery in the factory. It is made an offence to contravene the 
regulations.29
OTHER STATUTORY CONTROLS OVER NEIGHBOURHOOD 
NOISE
Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982
Noise from musical instruments, etc.: dogs
Noise from televisions, radios, music systems and other amplified sound is a perennial 
problem in the UK. Excessive noise from such devices can rank either as a nuisance 
or a statutory nuisance as covered in Chapters 3 and 4 respectively.30 In Scotland, 
the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 gives police the power to deal with 
specific types of noise. Under s 54(1) of the Act any person who sounds or plays 
a musical instrument, sings, performs or operates any radio or television receiver, 
record player, tape recorder, or other sound-producing device so as to give any other

person reasonable cause for annoyance, and fails to desist on being required to do so 
by a constable in uniform, commits an offence under the Act.31 Where a constable 
reasonably suspects that an offence has been committed in relation to a musical 
instrument, or in relation to a radio, television receiver, record player or other sound￾producing device, the constable may enter the premises on which they reasonably 
suspect the instrument or device to be and seize any such instrument or device that 
they there.32 The constable may use reasonable force in entering the premises and 
seizing the equipment.33
As far as noise being caused by dogs is concerned, s  49(1) provides that any 
person who suffers or permits any person in their charge to cause danger or injury to 
any other person who is in a public place, or to give such creature reasonable cause for 
alarm or annoyance, commits an offence and is liable to a penalty. Therefore, animals 
such as dogs that cause annoyance to neighbours, by barking, would fall within the 
scope of the section.
Noise Act 1996
Night-time noise has been a perennial problem. The Noise Act 1996 (the 1996 Act), 
which relates to the UK excluding Scotland, makes specific provision for night-time 
noise.
Investigation of complaints of noise at night
A local authority in England and Wales may, if it receives a complaint, falling within 
the scope of the Act, arrange for an officer of the authority to take reasonable steps 
to investigate the complaint.34 The kind of complaint referred to is one that is made 
by an individual who is present in a dwelling35 during night hours36 (referred to in 
the Act as the ‘complainant’s dwelling’), that excessive noise is being emitted from 
another dwelling, (referred to as the ‘offending dwelling’) or any premises in respect 
of which a premises licence37 or a temporary event notice38 has effect (referred to as 
the ‘offending premises’).39 A complaint may be made by any means.40 If an officer 
of the authority is satisfied, in consequence of an investigation, that noise is being 
emitted from the offending dwelling or the offending premises, during night hours 
and the noise, if it were measured from within the complainant’s dwelling, would or 
might exceed the permitted level (as defined in s 5) they may serve a notice under 
31 Section 54(1) of the 1982 Act is without prejudice to any offence committed under s 62 of COPA 
(operation of loudspeakers in streets): s 54(2). See above. 32 Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 s 54(2A). 33 Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 s 54(2B). 34 Noise Act 1996 s 2(1). 35 A ‘dwelling’ means any building or part of a building, used or intended to be used, as a dwelling. 
References to noise emitted from a dwelling include noise emitted from any garden, yard or outhouse 
or other appurtenance belonging to or enjoyed with the dwelling: s 11(2). 36 ‘Night hours’ means the period beginning with 11pm and ending with the following 7am: s 2(6). 37 ‘Premises licence’ has the same meaning as in the Licensing Act 2003: s 2(7A). 38 ‘Temporary event notice’ has the same meaning as in the Licensing Act 2003. 39 1996 Act s 2(2). 40 1996 Act s 2(3).69
Neighbourhood Noise
s 3.41 The officer has power to decide whether any noise, if it were measured from 
within the complainant’s dwelling, would or might exceed the permitted level.42 The 
officer also has the power to decide whether to assess the noise either from within 
or outside the complainant’s dwelling, and also whether or not to use any device for 
measuring the noise.
Warning notices
The Act makes provision for the service of warning notices. A warning notice is 
required to state that an officer of the authority considers that noise is being emitted 
from the offending dwelling or offending premises during night hours and that the 
noise either exceeds, or may exceed, the permitted level as measured from within 
the complainant’s dwelling.43 If the complaint is in respect of a dwelling, the notice 
must give warning that any person who is responsible for noise that is emitted from 
an offending dwelling, in the period specified in the notice, and that exceeds the 
permitted level as measured from within the complainant’s dwelling, may be guilty 
of an offence. Where the complaint is in respect of other premises the warning 
notice is required to state that the responsible person, in relation to the offending 
premises, may be guilty of an offence if noise that exceeds the permitted level, as 
measured from within the complainant’s dwelling, is emitted from the premises in 
the period specified in the notice. The period specified in the warning notice must 
be a period beginning not earlier than ten minutes after the time when the notice is 
served and ending with the following 7am.44 Where the complaint is in respect of 
a dwelling, a warning notice must be served by delivering it to any person present 
at, or near, the offending dwelling and appearing to the officer to be responsible for 
the noise.45 However, if it is not reasonably practical to identify any person present, 
at or near the dwelling as being the person responsible for the noise on whom the 
notice may reasonably be served, the warning notice requires to be served by leaving 
it at the offending dwelling. Where the relevant complaint relates to other premises, 
a warning notice must be served by delivering it to the person who appears to the 
officer of the authority to be the responsible person, in relation to the offending 
premises, at the time when the notice is served.46 A warning notice requires to state 
the time at which it is served.47
Responsible person
A person is responsible for noise emitted from a dwelling if they are a person to whose 
act, default or sufferance the emission of the noise is wholly, or partly, attributable.48
The responsible person in relation to offending premises at a particular time is:
41 1996 Act s 2(4). 42 1996 Act s 2(5). 43 1996 Act s 3(1). 44 1996 Act s 3(2). 45 1996 Act s 3(3). 46 1996 Act s 3(3A). 47 1996 Act s 3(4). 48 1996 Act s 3(5).NOISE AND NOISE LAW
70
(a) where a premises licence has effect in respect of the premises,
(i) the person who holds the premises licence (or a temporary event notice has 
effect) if he is present at the premises at that time,
(ii) where that person is not present at the premises at that time, the designated 
premises supervisor under the licence, if he is present at the premises at that time, 
or
(iii) where neither of the persons mentioned in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) is present 
at the premises at that time, any other person who is present at the premises at 
that time, and who is in charge of the premises,
(b) where a temporary event notice has effect in respect of the premises-
(i) the premises user in relation to that notice, if he is present at the premises at that 
time, or
(ii) where the premises user is not present at the premises at that time, any other 
person present at the premises at that time, who is in charge of the premises.49
Offences
If a warning notice has been served in respect of noise emitted from a dwelling, 
any person who is responsible for noise that is emitted from the dwelling in the 
period specified in the notice and exceeds the permitted level, as measured from the 
complainant’s dwelling, commits an offence.50 It is a defence for a person charged to 
show that there was reasonable excuse for the act, default or sufferance in question.51
A person who commits an offence is liable to a fine.52
If a warning notice has been served under s 3 in respect of noise emitted from 
premises and that the noise is emitted in the period specified in the notice with 
such noise exceeding the permitted level, as measured from within the complainant’s 
dwelling, the responsible person in relation to the offending premises at the time 
at which that noise is emitted commits an offence.53 Any person who commits an 
offence is liable to a fine.54
Permitted level of noise
The appropriate person55 is given the power, by directions, to determine in writing 
the maximum level of noise (i.e. the ‘permitted level’) that may be emitted during 
night time hours from any dwelling or other premises.56 The permitted level is to be 
a level applicable to noise, as measured from within any other dwelling in the vicinity, 
by an approved device used in accordance with any conditions subject to which 
approval was given.57 Different permitted levels may be determined for different 
circumstances and the permitted level may be determined partly by reference to 
49 1996 Act s 3(6). 50 1996 Act s 4(1). 51 1996 Act s 4(2). 52 1996 Act s 4(3). 53 1996 Act s 4A(1). 54 1996 Act s 4A(2). 55 The appropriate person is the Secretary of State for England and the National Assembly for Wales for 
Wales: s 11(2). 56 1996 Act s 5(1). 57 1996 Act s 5(2).71
Neighbourhood Noise
other levels of noise.58 The appropriate person may vary the directions by further 
directions in writing.59
Approval of measuring devices
Power is given to the appropriate person to approve, in writing, any type of device 
that is used in the measurement of noise for the purposes of ss 2–9 inclusive.60Any 
such approval may be given subject to conditions as to the purposes for which, and 
the manner and other circumstances in which, devices of the type concerned may 
be used.61 In any proceedings for an offence under ss 4 or 4A, a measurement of 
noise made by a device is not admissible as evidence of the level of noise unless it is 
an approved device and any conditions subject to which the approval was given are 
satisfied.62
Fixed penalty notices
The 1996 Act makes provision for the service of fixed penalty notices. Where an 
officer of a local authority, who is authorised for the purposes of s  8 of the Act, 
has reason to believe that a person is either committing, or has just committed an 
offence under ss 4 or 4A, the officer is empowered to give that person a fixed penalty 
notice, offering them the opportunity of discharging any liability to conviction for 
that offence by payment of a fixed penalty.63 A fixed penalty notice may be given to 
a person either: (a) by delivering it to them; or (b) if it is not reasonably possible to 
deliver it to them, by leaving the notice addressed to them at the offending dwelling 
or offending premises, as the case may be.64
Where a person is given a fixed penalty notice in respect of such an offence, 
proceedings for that offence must not be instituted within fourteen days from the 
date of the notice.65 The relevant person cannot be convicted of that offence if they 
pay the fixed penalty before the end of that period. The notice must give particulars 
of the circumstances that are alleged to constitute the offence, as are necessary for 
giving reasonable information of the offence.66 The fixed penalty notice is required 
to state: (a) that proceedings cannot be taken against them within fourteen days 
from the date of the service of the notice; (b) the amount of fixed penalty; and (c) 
the person to whom, and the address at which, the fixed penalty may be paid.67 The 
1996 Act makes provision for the amount of fixed penalty.68
If a fixed penalty notice is given to a person in respect of noise emitted from any 
dwelling in any period specified in a warning notice, then no further fixed penalty 
notice may be given to that person in respect of noise emitted from that dwelling

during that period.69 However, that person may be convicted of a further offence 
under s 4,70 in respect of noise emitted from the dwelling after the fixed penalty 
notice is given and before the end of that period. 
If a fixed penalty notice is given to a person in respect of noise from other premises 
in any period that is specified in a warning notice, no further fixed penalty notice 
may be given to that person in respect of noise emitted from the premises during that 
period.71 However, that person may be convicted of a further offence under s 4A, in 
respect of noise emitted from the premises after the fixed penalty notice is given and 
before the end of that period.
Powers of entry and seizure 
The 1996 Act makes provision for powers of entry and seizure. An officer of a local 
authority, or a person authorised by the authority for the purpose, has the power 
to enter the relevant dwelling, or other premises, from which the noise in question 
either is being or has been emitted and may seize and remove any equipment that 
appears to them as being, or has been used in, the emission of the noise.72 The power 
of entry may be exercised where an officer of the authority has reason to believe that: 
(a) a warning notice has been served in respect of noise emitted from a dwelling, or 
other premises; and (b) at any time in the period specified in the notice noise emitted 
from the dwelling or other premises, has exceeded the permitted level as measured 
from within the complainant’s dwelling.73 A person exercising the power of entry is 
required to produce their authority if they are required to do so.74
The 1996 Act empowers a justice of the peace to authorise entry to relevant 
premises. If it is shown to a justice of the peace, on sworn information in writing, 
that:
(a) a warning notice has been served in respect of noise emitted from a dwelling 
or other premises,
(b) at any time in the period specified in the notice, noise emitted from the 
dwelling, or other premises, has exceeded the permitted level as measured 
from the complainant’s dwelling, and
(c) entry of an officer of the local authority or a person authorised by the local 
authority for the purpose, to the dwelling or other premises, has been refused, 
or such refusal is apprehended, or a request by an officer, or of such a person, 
for admission, would defeat the object of the entry, 
the justice of the peace may, by warrant under their hand, authorise the local authority, 
by any of their officers or any person authorised by them for the purpose to enter 
the dwelling or other premises, if need be by force.75 The person who enters any 
dwelling or other premises, or by virtue of a warrant issued by a justice of the peace,

Neighbourhood Noise
may take with him such other persons and such equipment as may be necessary.76
If the dwelling, or other premises, is unoccupied when the person who enters leaves, 
they are required to leave it, or them, as effectively secured against trespassers as 
they found it, or them. A warrant issued under s 10(4) continues in force until the 
purpose for which the entry is required has been satisfied.77 Any person who wilfully 
obstructs any person exercising any powers under s 10(2) or (7) is liable to a fine on 
summary conviction.78
ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOUR
We now consider, chronologically, statutes that address the problem of antisocial 
behaviour, which can manifest itself in many ways, including conduct that generates 
noise to the annoyance of others.
Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004
In A Partnership for a Better Scotland: Partnership Agreement79 the Scottish Government 
committed itself to social justice, in particular to ensure that everyone in Scotland 
could enjoy a decent quality of life. It pledged to tackle antisocial behaviour. The 
Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 (ABSA) makes provision for various 
forms of antisocial behaviour, amongst which is the generation of noise.
Antisocial behaviour orders
Part 2 of ABSA makes provision for antisocial behaviour orders. Under s  4(1) a 
sheriff, on the application of a relevant authority,80 if satisfied that the following 
conditions are met, can make an antisocial behaviour order. The conditions are:
(a) that the specified person is at least twelve years of age;
(b) that the specified person has engaged in antisocial behaviour towards a 
relevant person, and
(c) that an antisocial behaviour order is necessary for the purpose of protecting 
relevant persons from further antisocial behaviour by the specified person.81
The expression ‘antisocial behaviour’ is defined as such if the relevant person:
(a) acts in a manner that causes or is likely to cause alarm or distress; or
(b) pursues a course of conduct82 that causes or is likely to cause alarm or distress 
to at least one person who is not of the same household as that person.83
76 1996 Act s 10(5). 77 1996 Act s 10(6). 78 1996 Act s 10(8). 79 May 2003. 80 ‘Relevant authority’ means: (a) a local authority; or (b) a registered social landlord: ABSA s 18. 81 ABSA s 4(2). 82 ‘Conduct’ includes speech, and a course of conduct must involve conduct on at least two occasions: 
s 143(2). 83 ABSA s 143(1).NOISE AND NOISE LAW
74
Antisocial behaviour can, therefore, include conduct that generates noise. The 
expression ‘distress’ as used in ABSA is not defined. It should, therefore, be given 
its everyday meaning. Any form of noise annoyance or anxiety on the part of the 
receiver, could, therefore, fall within the scope of ABSA. It would be a question of 
fact whether the conduct in question had caused distress.
Noise nuisance
Part 5 of ABSA makes special provision for neighbourhood noise. The provisions 
of Part 5 are similar to those contained in the Noise Act 1996, which have been 
discussed above.84
The provisions of ABSA that relate to the control of noise85 apply to the area of a 
local authority only if the local authority has so resolved.86 A local authority that has 
resolved to adopt ABSA has some flexibility as to the periods of the week (i.e. noise 
control periods) the noise control periods should apply.87 The noise control provisions 
could be confined to night-time hours. The noise control provisions may be made 
to apply to the whole week.88 The local authority may specify different noise control 
periods for different areas and also to different times of the year. The authority may 
also specify that different noise control periods apply for different circumstances. 
ABSA also makes provision for publicity. If a local authority resolves to apply the noise 
control provisions in its area, the local authority is required to have a notice published 
in a local newspaper that circulates in the area.89 At least one month before the relevant 
commencement date (i.e. the date on which the noise control period commences) the 
local authority is required to give a copy of the resolution to the Scottish Ministers, 
and also to each local authority whose area adjoins its area. The relevant notice requires 
to state that the resolution has been passed.90 The notice also requires to contain its 
commencement date, and inter alia, set out the general effect of the noise control 
provisions of ABSA, as well as the noise control periods specified in the resolution. 
ABSA also makes provision for the resolution to be either revoked or varied.91
Investigations of excessive noise
ABSA makes provision for the investigation of noise by the relevant local authority. 
Where a local authority receives a complaint from an individual that excessive noise 
is being emitted from relevant property92 during a noise control period, the local 
84 See above. 85 ABSA ss 43–47. 86 ABSA s 41(1). 87 ABSA s 41(2). 88 ABSA s 41(3). 89 ABSA s 41(5). 90 ABSA s 41(6). 91 ABSA s 42(1). 92 ‘Relevant property’ means: (a) any accommodation; (b) any land belonging exclusively to; or enjoyed or 
enjoyed exclusively with any accommodation; (c) any land not falling within paragraph (b)(i) to which 
at least two people have rights in common; and (ii) which is used by those persons as a private garden; 
(d) any common passage, close, court, stair, lift or yard pertinent to any tenement or group of separately 
owned houses; or (e) such other place as may be prescribed (i.e. by the Scottish Ministers): ABSA
s 53(1). 75
Neighbourhood Noise
authority must ensure that an officer of the authority investigates the matter.93
However, the expression ‘investigates’ is not defined in ABSA. Therefore, there is no 
statutory requirement, for example, that any officer of the local authority should visit 
the alleged offender’s premises, or that of the complainant. The relevant complaint 
can be investigated by any means.94 If, in consequence of such an investigation, an 
officer is satisfied that noise is being emitted from a relevant property (the ‘offending 
property’) and the noise, if it was measured from the relevant place,95 would or 
might exceed the permitted level,96 the officer may serve a notice about the noise 
under s 44.97 It is a matter for the discretion of the officer concerned, first, whether 
any noise might exceed the permitted level, and second, to decide from which place 
to assess the noise and whether to use a device for measuring noise.98 Where a local 
authority (the ‘first local authority’) receives a complaint that concerns offending 
property that is situated within the area of another local authority, the first authority 
is empowered to deal with that property under ABSA as if that property was situated 
in the area of the first local authority, whether or not the noise control provisions of 
ABSA apply to the latter area.99
Warning notices
ABSA makes provision for the service of warning notices. A warning notice requires 
to state that the officer of the authority considers that noise is being emitted from 
the offending property during a noise control period and that the noise either 
exceeds, or may exceed, the permitted level, as measured from a relevant place.100 The 
notice must also state that any person who is responsible for noise emitted from the 
offending property in the period specified in the notice and exceeds the permitted 
level, as measured from a relevant place, may be guilty of an offence. The period 
that is specified in a warning notice is the period that begins not earlier than ten 
minutes after the time when the notice is served and ends at the relevant time.101
The expression ‘relevant time’ is defined as the earlier of the end of the noise control 
period during which the warning notice is served and the point (if any) at which the 
permitted level at the time the notice is served ceases to be applicable.102 The warning 
notice requires to be served, by delivering it to any person present at, or near, the 
93 ABSA s 43(1). 94 ABSA s 43(2). 95 ‘Relevant place’ means: (a) any place within accommodation (except in the case of measurement of 
noise emitted from relevant property which is accommodation, that accommodation); and (b) such 
other place as may be prescribed; ABSA s 53(1). 96 Under s  48 the Scottish Ministers are empowered to prescribe the maximum level of noise by 
regulations. The permitted level of noise is the level of noise as measured from any relevant place by an 
approved device that is used in accordance with any conditions subject to which approval was given. 
Different permitted levels may be prescribed for different periods of the week, areas or description of 
areas, times of the year or other circumstances. The Antisocial Behaviour (Noise Control) (Scotland) 
Regulations 2005 (SSI 2005/43) reg 3 prescribe relevant noise levels for purposes of ABSA. 97 ABSA s 43(3). 98 ABSA s 43(4). 99 ABSA s 43(5). 100 ABSA s 44(1). 101 ABSA s 44(2). 102 ABSA s 44(3).NOISE AND NOISE LAW

offending property, and appearing to the officer of the authority to be responsible 
for the noise.103 If it is not reasonably practical to identify any person who is present 
either at, or near, the offending property as being a person responsible for the noise 
on whom the notice can reasonably be served, the warning notice requires to be 
served by leaving it at the offending property.104 The warning notice requires to state 
the time at which it is served.105
Offences
If a noise notice has been served in respect of noise that is emitted from a relevant 
property, any person who is responsible for noise emitted from the relevant property 
in the period specified in the notice, and exceeds the permitted level, as measured from 
a relevant place, commits an offence.106 Liability for the offence is strict. Therefore, 
there is no need for the prosecution to establish intention, or fault, on the part of the 
accused. A person who is guilty of such an offence is liable, on summary conviction, 
to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.107 However, in common with 
statutes that make provision for offences of strict liability, ABSA makes provision for 
statutory defence. It is a defence for a person who is charged with an offence under 
s 45(1) to show that there was reasonable excuse for the act, failure, or sufferance by 
reference to which the person was charged.108 In proceedings for an offence under 
s 45, a measurement of noise by a device is not admissible as evidence of a level of 
noise unless the device is an approved device and any conditions subject to which the 
approval was given are satisfied.109 The Scottish Ministers have power to approve by 
regulations any type of device that is used in the measurement of noise.110 Approval 
may be given subject to such conditions as to the purposes for which, or the manner 
or circumstances in which, devices of the type approved are to used, as may be 
prescribed in the regulations.111
Fixed penalty notices
Traditionally, one of the main failings of noise control legislation has been the 
inability of local authorities to immediately compel an individual who is making 
excessive noise to refrain from so doing. ABSA addresses this problem. Where a 
relevant officer112 has reason to believe that a person is either committing, or has just 
committed, an offence under s 45 the officer may give that person a fixed penalty 
notice, which offers the relevant individual the opportunity of discharging any 
103 ABSA s 44(4). 104 ABSA s 44(5). 105 ABSA s 44(6). 106 ABSA s 45(1). 107 ABSA s 45(2). 108 ABSA s 45(3). 109 ABSA s 45(5). 110 ABSA s 49(1). The Antisocial Behaviour (Noise Control) (Scotland) Regulations 2005 reg 5 prescribes 
noise measuring devices that are approved in terms of ABSA. 111 ABSA s 49(2). 112 A relevant officer means an officer of the local authority who is authorised for the purposes of s 46 or 
a constable: ABSA s 46(2).77
Neighbourhood Noise
liability to conviction for that offence by payment of a fixed penalty.113 If a fixed 
penalty notice is given to a person in respect of noise that is emitted from a relevant 
property in the period that is specified in a warning notice, no further fixed penalty 
notice may be given to that person in respect of the noise emitted from the relevant 
property during that period.114 A fixed penalty notice may be given to a person by 
delivering the notice to the person.115 However, if it is not reasonably practical to 
deliver the notice to the person, a fixed penalty notice is required to be given by leaving 
the notice addressed to the person at the offending property.116 The notice requires 
to give sufficient particulars of the circumstances that are alleged to constitute the 
offence.117 The fixed penalty notice is also required to state the period during which 
proceedings may not be taken for the offence, the amount of fixed penalty, and the 
address at which the fixed penalty can be paid.118 Proceedings may not be instituted 
during a period of twenty-one days from the date of the service of the notice.119 A 
person may not be convicted of the offence if the appropriate fixed penalty is paid 
before the expiration of that period.
Power of seizure of equipment
In practical terms and, indeed, in the mind of the public, one of the most important 
features of ABSA are the provisions that relate to the seizure of equipment used to 
create noise. An officer of the local authority, or a person who is authorised by the 
local authority for the purpose, may seize and remove any equipment that appears 
to either being, or has been used, in the emission of noise.120 The equipment can be 
seized and removed if a warning notice has been served in respect of the noise that 
has been emitted from the relevant property and an officer of the local authority, in 
whose area the relevant property is situated, has reason to believe that at any time in 
the period specified in the notice, noise that was emitted from the relevant property 
exceeded the permitted level, as measured from a relevant place.121 If required to do so, 
a person who is exercising the power of seizure, etc. must produce their authority.122
If a sheriff, or justice of the peace, is satisfied by evidence on oath that a warning 
notice has been served in respect of noise emitted from relevant property and that 
at any time in the period that has been specified in the notice, noise that is emitted 
from the relevant property has exceeded the permitted level (as measured from a 
relevant place) and that entry of an officer of the local authority, or of a person who 
is authorised by the authority for the purpose, to a relevant property has been refused 
or refusal is apprehended (or, alternatively, a request by an officer of the authority 
would defeat the object of entry), the sheriff or justice may grant a warrant.123 The

relevant warrant authorises the local authority, by any of its officers or any person 
authorised by it for the purpose, to enter the relevant property for the purpose of 
seizing and removing any equipment that appears to be being used, or to have been 
used, in the emission of noise and in order to do so, to open lockfast places on the 
relevant property.124 The person who enters premises by virtue of a warrant that is 
granted under s 47 may be accompanied by such persons and take such equipment 
as may be necessary.125 Where the relevant property is unoccupied, on the person’s 
departure it must be left as effectively secure against trespassers as it was when the 
person entered it. It is made an offence for a person to wilfully obstruct a person in 
the exercise of their powers of seizure and removal of equipment under s 47(2), or in 
exercising the power that is conferred by warrant under s 47(2).126
Power to fund local authorities
A unique feature of ABSA is that in order to ensure that the provisions of the Act 
are properly enforced, ABSA empowers the Scottish Ministers to make payment to a 
local authority in respect of the whole, or any part, of the expenditure of the authority 
in carrying out its noise control functions under ABSA.127
General overview of ABSA Part 5 and the Noise Act 1996
We have seen that ABSA employs noise standards that are based on fixed noise 
levels, in contrast to the nuisance-based regime that has traditionally played such 
a prominent role in noise law in Scotland and, indeed, the UK thus far. One of 
the main practical disadvantages with a regime that is nuisance-based is that it is 
often difficult to ascertain whether a given state of affairs ranks as a noise nuisance 
in law. A regime that employs fixed standards is, in theory at least, simpler and 
easier to understand by the creator of the noise and, importantly, by the general 
public.128 
Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 
In May 2012 the UK government published a White Paper, Putting victims first: 
more effective responses to anti-social behaviour.
129 The White Paper set out how the 
Government would support local areas to focus the response to antisocial behaviour 
on the needs of victims; empower communities to get involved in tackling antisocial 
behaviour; ensure that professionals were able to protect the public quickly and 
focus on long-term solutions. The proposed reforms were intended to provide better 
124 ABSA s 47(5). 125 ABSA s 47(6). 126 ABSA s 47(7). 127 ABSA s 50(1). 128 Rowan-Robinson and Watchman argue that the use of general environmental standards such as 
nuisance make it difficult for traders, etc. to know with any degree of certainty whether or not they are 
complying with the law. Such standards also make enforcement problematic and lead to disagreement 
as to whether an offence has been committed: J. Rowan-Robinson and P. Watchman, Crime and 
Regulation (T. and T. Clark, 1990) at 191. 129 Cm 8367 (2012), available at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/

protection for victims and communities and ensure that professionals had effective 
powers that were quick, practical and easy to use and acted as real deterrents to 
perpetrators. The policy, which was embodied in the White Paper, formed the basis of 
the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, which makes provision for 
a wide array of behaviour that can be included under the rubric ‘antisocial’. However, 
we simply focus on the provisions that can include conduct that generates noise. The 
provisions dealt with relate to England and Wales.
Power to grant injunctions
Under the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 (the 2014 Act) a 
court has the power to grant an injunction against a person aged ten or over if two 
conditions are met.130
The first condition is that the court is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, 
that that person either has engaged, or threatens to engage, in antisocial behaviour.131
The second condition is that the court considers it just and convenient to grant 
the injunction for the purpose of preventing the respondent engaging in antisocial 
behaviour.132 Antisocial behaviour is defined as conduct that has caused, or is likely 
to cause, harassment, alarm or distress to any person; conduct capable of causing 
nuisance, or annoyance, to a person in relation to that person’s occupation of 
residential premises133; or conduct capable of causing housing-related nuisance, 
or annoyance, to any person.134 The creation of noise would, therefore, clearly be 
included in the definition of ‘antisocial’. 
The injunction may, for the purpose of preventing the respondent from engaging 
in antisocial behaviour, prohibit the respondent from doing anything described in 
the injunction, and also require the respondent to do anything described in the 
injunction.135 The prohibitions and requirements in any injunction must, so far is 
reasonably practical, be such as to avoid: (a) any interference with the times, if any, 
at which the respondent normally works, or attends school, or any other educational 
establishment; and (b) any conflict with the requirements of any other court order, 
or injunction, to which the respondent may be subject.136 An injunction must: (a) 
specify the period for which it has effect; or (b) state that it has effect until further 
order.137 In the case of an injunction granted before the respondent has reached the 
age of eighteen, a period must be specified. That period must be no longer than 
twelve months. The injunction may specify particular periods for which particular 
prohibitions, or requirements, have effect.138 An application for an injunction requires

to conduct that is capable of causing nuisance or annoyance to a person in relation to that person’s 
occupation of residential premises: 2014 Act s 2(2). 134 2014 Act s 2(1). 135 2014 Act s 1(4). 136 2014 Act s 1(5). 137 2014 Act s 1(6). 138 2014 Act s 1(7).NOISE AND NOISE LAW

to be made to a youth court, in the case of a respondent aged under eighteen, or the 
High Court in any other case.139
Closure of premises
Whilst noise from licensed premises, including nightclubs, which ranks as a nuisance 
would fall within the scope of ss 79(1)(g) and 82 of the EPA, an important additional 
means of controlling noise from such premises is the closure of the premises. 
Closure notices
Under s  76 of the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 a police 
officer of at least the rank of inspector, or the local authority, may issue a closure 
notice if satisfied on reasonable grounds: (a) that the use of particular premises has 
resulted or (if the notice is not issued) is likely soon to result in nuisance to the 
general public; or, (b) that there has been (or if the notice is not issued) is likely 
soon to be disorder near those premises associated with the use of those premises, 
and that the notice is necessary to prevent the nuisance or disorder from continuing, 
recurring or occurring.140 A closure notice is a notice that prohibits access to the 
premises for a period specified in the notice.141 A closure notice may prohibit access: 
(a) by all persons, except those specified, or by all persons, except those of a specified 
description; (b) at all times, or at all times except those except those specified; (c) in 
all circumstances, or in all circumstances except those specified.142 However, a closure 
notice may not prohibit access by people who habitually live on the premises, or the 
owner of the premises.143 Those persons must be specified under s 76(3)(a). 
A closure notice is required to contain a variety of information, including: the 
identity of the premises; the effect of the notice; a statement to the effect that 
failure to comply with the notice is an offence; a statement that an application will 
be made under s 80 for a closure order144; specify where and when the application 
will be heard; and explain the effect of a closure order.145 The notice must also give 
information of the names of and the means of contacting persons and organisations 
in the area that provide advice about housing and legal matters. A closure order 
can only be made if reasonable efforts have been made to inform people who live 
on the premises (whether habitually or not) and any person who has control of or 
responsibility for the premises, or who has an interest in them, that the notice is 
going to be issued.146 Before issuing a closure notice the police officer, or the local 
authority, must ensure that any body or individual that the officer or the authority 
thinks appropriate, has been consulted.147 The maximum period that may be specified

in a closure notice is twenty-four hours.148 However, this period is extended to forty￾eight hours if in the case of a notice issued by a police officer, the officer is of at least 
the rank of superintendent, or in the case of a notice issued by a local authority, the 
notice is signed by the chief executive officer of the authority, or a person designated 
by them for the purposes of s 77(2).149 The period specified in the notice to which 
s 77(2) does not apply may be extended by up to twenty-four hours if: (a) in the case 
of a notice issued by a police officer an extension notice is issued by an officer of at 
least the rank of superintendent; or (b) if, in the case of a notice issued by a local 
authority, the authority issues an extension notice150 signed by the chief executive 
officer of the authority, or a person designated by the chief executive officer for the 
purposes of s 77(2).151
The 2014 Act makes provision for the cancellation, or variation, of closure 
notices.152 The Act also makes provision for the service of such notices.153
Closure orders
Wherever a closure notice is issued, an application must be made to a magistrates’ 
court for a closure order, unless the notice has been cancelled under s  78.154 An 
application for a closure order must be made by a constable if the closure notice was 
issued by a police officer.155 If the notice was issued by an authority, the application 
for a closure order must be made by the relevant authority. 
The application must be heard by the magistrates’ court not later than forty-eight 
hours after the service of the closure notice.156 The court has the power to make a 
closure order if it is satisfied that:
(a) the person has engaged or (or if the order is not made) is likely to engage, in 
disorderly offensive or criminal behaviour on the premises; or
(b) that the use of the premises has resulted or (if the order is not made) is likely 
to result, in serious nuisance to members of the public; or
(c) that there has been or (if the order is not made) is likely to be, disorder near 
those premises, associated with the use of those premises, 
and that the order is necessary to prevent the behaviour, nuisance or disorder from 
continuing, recurring or occurring.157
A closure order is an order prohibiting access to the premises for a period specified 
in the order.158 The relevant period must not exceed three months. A closure order 
may prohibit access: (a) by all persons, or by all persons except those specified; (b) in 
148 2014 Act s 77(1). 149 2014 Act s 77(2). 150 An extension notice is a notice that identifies the closure notice to which it relates and also specifies 
the period of the extension: 2014 Act s 77(5). 151 2014 Act s 77(4). 152 2014 Act s 78. 153 2014 Act s 79. 154 2014 Act s 80(1). 155 2014 Act s 80(2). 156 2014 Act s 80(3). 157 2014 Act s 80(5). 158 2014 Act s 80(6).NOISE AND NOISE LAW

all circumstances, or in all circumstances except those specified.159 A closure order 
may be made in respect of the whole or part of the premises and may also include 
provision about access to a part of the building, or structure, of which the premises 
forms part.160
Temporary orders
The 2014 Act makes provision for temporary orders. Section 81 of the Act applies 
where an application has been made under s 80 to a magistrates’ court for a closure 
order.161 If the court does not make a closure order it may, nevertheless, order that 
the closure notice continues in force for a specified further period of not more than 
forty-eight hours, if satisfied that: (a) that the use of particular premises has resulted 
(or if the notice is not continued) is likely soon to result in nuisance to the general 
public; or (b) that there has been (or if the notice is not continued) is likely soon to 
be disorder near those premises, associated with the use of those premises, and that 
the continuation of the notice is necessary to prevent the nuisance, or disorder, from 
continuing, recurring or occurring.162
Extension of closure orders
The 2014 Act makes provision for the extension of closure orders. At any time 
before the expiry of a closure order an application may be made to the justice of 
the peace, by complaint, for an extension (or further extension) of the period for 
which the order is in force.163 Those entitled to make the order are: (a) where the 
closure order was made on the application of a constable, a police officer of at least 
the rank of an inspector; (b) where the closure order was made on the application 
of a local authority, that authority.164 Either a police officer, or local authority, may 
make an application only if satisfied on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for 
the period of the order to be extended to prevent the occurrence, recurrence or 
continuance of:
(a) disorderly, offensive or criminal behaviour on the premises;
(b) serious nuisance to members of the public resulting from the use of the 
premises; or
(c) disorder near the premises associated with the use of the premises, and 
also satisfied that the appropriate consultee165 has been consulted about the 
intention to make the application.166

(b) the chief officer of police for the area in which the premises are situated in the case of an application 
by a local authority: s 82(4). 166 2014 Act s 82(3).83
Neighbourhood Noise
If the magistrates’ court is satisfied that the above requirements are satisfied, it may 
make an order either extending (or further extending) the period of the closure order 
by a period not exceeding three months.167
The 2014 Act makes provision for the discharge of a closing order.168 The Act 
also provides for appeals to the crown court against a decision to make or extend a 
closure order.169
Enforcement of closure orders
An authorised person170 has the power: (a) to enter premises in respect of which a 
closure order is in force; and (b) do anything necessary to secure the premises against 
entry.171 The person entering the premises may use reasonable force.172 The person 
seeking to enter the premises must, if required to do so by, or on behalf of the owner, 
occupier, or other person in charge of the premises, produce evidence of their identity 
and authority before entering the premises.173
Offences
It is made an offence for any person, without a reasonable excuse, to either remain on, 
or enter premises, in contravention of a closure notice (including a notice continued in 
force under s 81).174 It is also made an offence for a person, without reasonable excuse, 
to remain on, or enter premises, in contravention of a closure order.175 Furthermore, 
it is made an offence for any person, without reasonable excuse, to obstruct a person 
acting under ss 79 or 85(1).176 Section 86 also makes provision for relevant penalties 
for offences that have been committed under the section.177
LICENSING OF PREMISES THAT SELL ALCOHOL
Licensing Act 2003
In recent years, in order to attract custom licensed premises have increasingly 
provided entertainment in the form of live music, karaoke and discotheques for their 
customers. Such activities can, of course, generate noise. Noise can also be generated 
by patrons entering or leaving premises. Premises that sell alcohol have been regulated 
for many years in the UK in order to ensure that they are properly managed. Other 
forms of public entertainment and activities can also generate noise, to the annoyance 
167 2014 Act s 82(7). 168 2014 Act s 83. 169 2014 Act s 84. 170 ‘Authorised person’ means: (a) in relation to a closure order made on the application of a constable 
means a constable or a person authorised by the chief officer of police for the area in which the 
premises are situated; (b) in relation to a closure order made on the application of a local authority 
means a person authorised by that authority: s 85(2). 171 2014 Act s 85(1). 172 2014 Act s 85(3). 173 2014 Act s 85(4). 174 2014 Act s 86(1). 175 2014 Act s 86(2). 176 2014 Act s 86(3). 177 2014 Act s 86(4)–(6).NOISE AND NOISE LAW

of the neighbourhood. The Licensing Act 2003 (the 2003 Act)178 provides a unified 
system in England and Wales for the licensing of the sale and supply of alcohol, the 
provision of regulated entertainment,179 and the provision of late-night refreshments. 
The purpose of the system for licensing for licensable activities is to promote four 
fundamental objectives, namely ‘licensing objectives’. Those objectives are: (a) the 
prevention of crime and disorder; (b) public safety; (c)   the prevention of public 
nuisance; and (d) the protection of children from harm.180
The expression ‘public nuisance’ as used in the Act has never been judicially 
determined. The leading modern authority on public nuisance is Attorney General 
v PYA Quarries Ltd.
181 That case concerned a civil action that was brought by the 
attorney general on the relation of Glamorgan County Council and the Pontardawe 
Rural District Council to restrain a nuisance that had been caused by quarrying 
activities that were said to project stones and splinters into the neighbourhood, 
and cause dust and vibrations. Romer LJ was of the view that a public nuisance 
was a nuisance that materially affected the reasonable comfort of life of a class of 
Her Majesty’s subjects.182 In turn, Denning LJ (as he then was) stated that a public 
nuisance was a nuisance that was so indiscriminate in its effects that it would not be 
reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on their own responsibility to put 
a stop to it, but that it should be taken on the responsibility of community at large.183
In the absence of authority, it is suggested that the 2003 Act’s intention is to prevent 
licensed premises causing annoyance to the local community, in contradistinction 
to the public at large. In short, the licensing objective of the prevention of a ‘public 
nuisance’ under the Act should be more in line with the meaning of a private nuisance 
and therefore be limited to protecting a narrower class of individuals, such as local 
residents.184
The system of licensing is achieved through the provision of authorisations, 
through personal licenses, premises licenses, club premises certificates and temporary 
event notices. Personal licenses, premises licenses and club premises certificates are 
granted by the licensing authority where the premises are situated or, in the case 
of personal licenses, the licensing authority in which the applicant is normally 
resident. A licensing authority is required to carry out its licensing functions 
178 For a discussion of the provisions of the Licensing Act 2003, see R. McCracken et al, Statutory 
Nuisance, 4th edn (Bloomsbury, 2019) 10.33–10.39. 179 ‘Regulated entertainment’ is any entertainment that takes place before a live audience and is provided 
for the purpose of entertaining an audience: Licensing Act 2003 Sch 1. It includes: (a) a performance of 
a play; (b) an exhibition of a film; (c) an indoor sporting event; (d) a boxing or wrestling entertainment; 
(e) a performance of live music; (f ) any playing of recorded music; (g) a performance of dance; (h) 
entertainment of a similar description to that falling within (e), (f ) or (g) where certain conditions are 
met, one of which is that the entertainment takes place in the presence of an audience (or spectators). 180 Licensing Act 2003 s 4(2). In 2018 the Home Office issued a Revised Guidance under s 182 of the 
Licensing Act 2003. The Government stated that the legislation supported a number of other key aims 
and purposes, including protecting the public and local residents from crime, antisocial behaviour and 
noise nuisance caused by irresponsible licensed premises: para 1.8. 181 [1957] 2 QB 169. 182 [1957] 2 QB 169 at 184. 183 [1957] 2 QB 169 at 191. 184 In its Revised Guidance (fn 173 above) the Government stated that the expression, ‘public nuisance’ as 
used in the Act retained its common law meaning: para 2.16.85
Neighbourhood Noise
with a view to promoting the aforementioned, licensing objectives.185 A licensing 
authority is required to determine its licensing policy in relation to the exercise of its 
licensing functions.186 An authority could, for example, have a policy not to license 
establishments in a certain area, or to limit the type and size of establishment for 
which it will grant a licence. The licensing authority may also publish a cumulative 
impact assessment statement, to the effect that the licensing authority considers that 
the number of relevant authorisations in one or more parts of its area is such that it 
would be inconsistent with its licensing functions under the Act.187 For example, the 
licensing authority could limit the number of licenses granted in a certain area in 
order to protect residents and, indeed, the public, from excessive noise.
An important tool at the disposal of the licensing authority as far as the 
suppression of noise is concerned is the power to attach conditions to the grant of a 
premises licence188 and club certificates.189
It is made an offence to carry on a licensable activity on or from any premises 
otherwise than under, and in accordance with an authorisation, or to knowingly 
allow a licensable activity to be so carried on.190 The 2003 Act makes provision for the 
exemption of certain activities in certain locations where a license is not required.191
Under s 160(1) of the 2003 Act a magistrates’ court may make an order requiring 
all of the premises that are situated at or near a place of disorder or expected disorder 
and, in respect of which a premises license or temporary event notice has effect, 
to be closed for a period not exceeding twenty-four hours, specified in the order. 
However, a magistrates’ court may only make such an order on the application of a 
police officer who is of the rank of superintendent or above.192 The magistrates’ court 
may not make such an order unless it is necessary to prevent disorder.193 Where an 
order is made the following commit an offence if they knowingly keep any premises 
to which the order relates open during the period of the order.194 The relevant 
individuals are:
(i) the manager of the premises;
(ii) in the case of licensed premises, the holder of the premises license in respect 
of the premises;
(iii) the designated premises supervisor (if any) under such a licence; and

relating to noise would usually concern steps appropriate to control the levels of noise emanating from 
premises: at para 217. The guidance went on to state that any conditions appropriate to promote the 
prevention of public nuisance should be tailored to the type, nature and characteristics of the specific 
premises and its licensable activities. Furthermore, licensing authorities should avoid inappropriate or 
disproportionate measures that could deter events that were valuable to the community, such as live 
music. 190 2003 Act s 136(1). 191 2003 Act s 173(1). 192 2003 Act s 160(2). 193 2003 Act s 160(3). 194 2003 Act s 160(4).NOISE AND NOISE LAW

effect, the premises user in relation to that notice.195
A person guilty of an offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine.196
Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982
As far as Scotland is concerned, a licence is required for premises used as a place 
of public entertainment.197A licensing authority may attach conditions to a public 
entertainment licence, inter alia, fixing the date and the times when the premises 
may be open for the purposes of entertainment, or recreation.198
Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005
As far as Scotland is concerned, the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 regulates the 
sale of alcohol from premises. The Act allows a licensing board (which grants 
licenses to premises) to impose conditions that it considers necessary or expedient 
for the purposes of any of the licensing objectives that are contained in the Act.199
The licensing objectives include, ‘the prevention of public nuisances’. The expression 
‘public nuisance’ is unfortunate since Scots law (unlike the law of England) does not 
recognise the concept of public nuisance. The expression ‘public nuisance’ as used 
in the 2005 Act has not, thus far, been determined by the courts. It is suggested, 
however, that the phrase would certainly cover noise from licensed premises. Many 
licensing boards have imposed conditions in the relevant license to the effect that no 
noise should be discernible at the perimeter of the premises.
RAVES
Raves, by their very nature, can be a source of noise nuisance in the neighbourhood. 
The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (the 1994 Act) makes special 
provision for the control of what are commonly described as ‘raves’.
As far as England and Wales are concerned s 63(1) of the 1994 Act gives the 
police power to remove persons attending or preparing for a rave. The section applies 
to a gathering on land, in the open air, of twenty or more persons (whether or not 
trespassers) at which amplified music is played during the night (with or without 
permission) and is such as, by reason of its loudness or duration, and the time at 
which it is played, is likely to cause serious distress to the inhabitants of the locality. 
The expression ‘gathering’ for the purposes of the section is one where the gathering 
extends over several days throughout the period during which amplified music is 
played at night (with or without intermissions). Music includes sound wholly or 
predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats. 
195 2003 Act s 160(5). 196 2003 Act s 160(6). 197 Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 s 41(1). A place of public entertainment is defined as any place 
where members of the public are admitted or may use any facilities for the purposes of entertainment 
or recreation but does include certain premises such as athletic or sports grounds or educational 
establishments while these premises are being used as such: s 41(2). 198 Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 s 41(3). 199 Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 s 27(6).87
Neighbourhood Noise
The section also applies to a gathering on land of twenty or more persons who are 
trespassing on the land, and it would be a gathering of a kind mentioned in s 63(1) 
if it took place on land in the open air.200 If a police officer of at least the rank of 
superintendent reasonably believes that:
(a) two or more persons are making preparations for the holding there of a 
gathering to which s 63 applies,
(b) ten or more persons are waiting for such a gathering to begin there; or
(c) ten or more persons are attending such a gathering which is in progress,
the officer may give a direction that those persons, and other persons who come to 
prepare, or wait, for or to attend the gathering, are to leave the land and remove any 
vehicles, or other property, which they have with them on the land.201 A direction, if 
not communicated to these persons by the police officer giving the direction, may be 
communicated to them by any constable at the scene.202 Such persons are deemed as 
having had such a direction if reasonable steps have been taken to bring it to their 
attention.203 Such a direction does not apply to an exempt person.204
If a person, knowing that a direction has been given that applies to them: (a) fails 
to leave the land as soon as is reasonably practicable; or (b) having left, again enters 
the land within a period of seven days, beginning on the day on which the direction 
was given, commits an offence and is liable to imprisonment or a fine, or both.205
It is a defence for the accused to show that they had a reasonable excuse for 
failing to leave the land as soon as reasonably practicable or, as the case may be, for 
again entering the land.206
A person commits an offence if they know that a direction has been given under 
s 63(2) that applies to them and they make preparations to attend a gathering to 
which this section applies within a period of twenty-four hours, starting when the 
direction was given.207 Such a person is liable on summary conviction to imprisonment 
or a fine, or both.208
Section 63 does not apply in England and Wales to a gathering in relation to a 
licensable activity within s 1(1)(c) of the Licensing Act 2003 (provision of certain 
forms of entertainment) carried on, under and in accordance with, an authorisation 
within the meaning of s 136 of that Act.209 Nor does s 63 of the 1994 Act apply in 
Scotland to a gathering in premises, which by virtue of s 41 of the Civic Government 
(Scotland) Act 1982, are licensed to be used as a place of public entertainment.
The 1994 Act makes special provision for raves, as far as Scotland is concerned. 
Section 63 confers powers to remove persons either attending or preparing for a rave. 
200 1994 Act s 63(1A). 201 1994 Act s 63(2). 202 1994 Act s 63(3). 203 1994 Act s 63(4). 204 In relation to land (or any gathering on land) ‘exempt person’ means the occupier, any member of their

That section applies to a gathering on land in the open air of 100 or more persons 
(whether or not trespassers) at which amplified music is played during the night 
(with or without intermissions) and is, such as, by reason of its loudness and duration 
and the time at which it is played, likely to cause serious distress to the inhabitants 
of the locality.210 For the purposes of the section the gathering is required to continue 
during intermissions in the music and, where the gathering extends over several 
days, throughout the period during which amplified music is played at night (with 
or without intermissions). Power is conferred on a police officer of at least the rank 
of superintendent if certain requirements are met.211 These are that: (a) two or more 
persons are making preparations for the holding there of a gathering to which the 
section applies; (b) ten or more persons are waiting for such a gathering to begin 
there; (c) ten or more persons are attending such a gathering which is in progress. 
In such circumstances, the police officer may give a direction that those persons, and 
any other persons, who come to wait for or to attend the gathering, are to leave the 
land and remove other vehicles and property that they have with them on the land.
The remainder of the section is similar to that which applies to England and 
Wales. 
Section 64 of the 1994 Act confers additional powers on the police in relation 
to raves. If a police officer of at least the rank of superintendent reasonably believes 
that circumstances exist in relation to any land that would justify the giving of a 
direction under s 63, in relation to a gathering to which that section applies, they 
may authorise212 any constable to enter the land for the following purposes.213 These 
purposes are to ascertain whether such circumstances exist and to exercise any power 
that is conferred on a constable under s 63 or s 64(4).214 Under the latter if a direction 
has been given under s 63 and a constable reasonably suspects that any person to 
whom the direction applies has, without reasonable excuse, either: (a) failed to 
remove any vehicle215 or sound equipment on the land that appears to the constable 
to either belong to them or to be in their possession or under their control; or (b) 
entered the land as a trespasser216 with a vehicle or sound equipment within the 
period of seven days, beginning with the day on which the direction was given, the 
constable may seize and remove that vehicle or sound equipment.217 However, the 
power conferred under s 64(4) does not authorise the seizure of any vehicle or sound 
equipment of an exempt person.218
If a constable in uniform reasonably believes that a person is on their way to a 
gathering to which s 63 applies, in relation to which a direction under s 63(2) is in 
210 1994 Act s 63(1). 211 1994 Act s 63(2). 212 A constable who is so authorised can enter the land with or without warrant: 1994 Act s 64(3). 213 1994 Act s 64(1). 214 1994 Act s 64(2). 215 ‘Vehicle’ has the same meaning as in s 61: 1994 Act s 64(6). 216 In Scotland entering the land with sound equipment in circumstances mentioned in s 64(4)(b) is not 
an exercise of access rights within the meaning of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003: 1994 Act 
s 64(5A). 217 ‘Sound equipment’ means equipment designed or adapted for amplifying music and any equipment 
suitable for use in connection with such equipment. ‘Music’ has the same meaning as used in s 63: 1994 
Act s 64(6). 218 1994 Act s 64(5). See fn 198 for meaning of exempt person.89

force, they may stop that person and direct them not to proceed in the direction of 
the gathering.219 However, that power may only be exercised at a place within five 
miles of the boundary of the site of the gathering.220 Furthermore, no direction may 
be given to an exempt person.221
If a person, knowing that a direction under s 65(1) has been given to them fails 
to comply with that direction they commit an offence and are liable on summary 
conviction to a fine.222
In Scotland a constable in uniform who reasonably suspects that a person is 
committing an offence under s 65, may arrest them without a warrant.223
Where a person is convicted of an offence under s 63 in relation to a gathering to 
which that section applies, and the court is satisfied that any sound equipment that 
has been seized from them under s 64(4), or which was in their possession or under 
their control at the relevant time has been used at the gathering, the court may make 
an order for forfeiture in respect of that property.224
The 1994 Act makes provision for the retention and charges of seized property.225
FIREWORKS
Fireworks can pose a physical risk to those who use them, as well as others. Fireworks 
can also be used in various forms of antisocial behaviour, some of which is the creation 
of neighbourhood noise. The Fireworks Act 2003, which relates to the whole of the 
UK, enables the Secretary of State to make regulations for securing that there is no 
risk that the use of fireworks226 will have certain consequences, or for securing that 
the risk that the use of fireworks will have those consequences, is the minimum 
that is compatible with their being used.227 Any person who contravenes a provision 
imposed by fireworks regulations is guilty of an offence.228
The Fireworks Regulations 2004229 (the main purpose of which is to tackle the 
antisocial use of fireworks through regulation of their use and supply) make it an 
offence for any person under the age of eighteen to possess an adult firework230
in a public place.231 The Regulations also prohibit the possession of category four 
fireworks (i.e. professional display fireworks).232 These prohibitions do not include 
219 1994 Act s 65(1). 220 1994 Act s 65(2). 221 1994 Act s 65(3). An exempt person has the same meaning as in s 63: 1994 Act s 65(6). 222 1994 Act s 65(4). 223 1994 Act s 65(5). 224 1994 Act s 66(1). 225 1994 Act s 67. 226 ‘Fireworks’ means devices that: (a) are fireworks for the purposes of the British Standard Specification 
relating to fireworks, published on 30 November 1988 (BS 7114) or any British Standard replacing 
it; or (b) would be fireworks for those purposes if they were intended as a form of entertainment:

persons employed in the business of professional displays, fireworks manufacturers 
or importers, etc.233 The Regulations, subject to certain exceptions, also ban the use of 
adult fireworks during night hours.234 However, the ban does not extend to the use 
of a firework during a permitted fireworks night235 or any person who is employed 
by a local authority and who uses the firework in question either for the purposes of 
putting on a fireworks display by that authority at a national public celebration, or at 
a national commemorative event.236
The Regulations also require any person who supplies or exposes for supply any 
adult firework to be licensed in respect of each premises that are under their control, 
at which the fireworks are supplied, or exposed for supply.237 If the person who 
supplies, or exposes for sale, any firework in premises that are not under their control, 
such a person requires to be in possession of a licence that has been granted to them. 
However, these requirements do not apply during certain prescribed periods,238 or in 
certain circumstances.239 An application for a licence is required to be made to the 
local licensing authority where the relevant premises that are under the applicant’s 
control are situated or, if the premises are not under their control, the application is 
required to be made to the licensing authority where the principal business premises 
of the applicant are located.240 A local licensing authority may only grant a licence to 
person (‘A’) if satisfied that A, or another person on A’s behalf, holds a valid licence 
for the storage of the fireworks under the Explosives Regulations 2014,241 or a licence 
for storage is not required under the Explosives Regulations 2014.242
A local licensing authority may either refuse to grant a licence, or may revoke 
a licence that it has granted, if the applicant has committed certain offences.243 A 
person may appeal to the court against the decision of a local licensing authority to 
refuse to grant them a licence or to revoke a licence, and any such appeal requires to 
be made within twenty-eight days of the decision in question being notified to that 
person.244
Any person who either supplies (whether by retail or wholesale) or exposes for 
supply, any adult firework or sparkler in any premises, is required to display, in a 
prominent position in the premises, a notice that contains certain information.245
Where adult fireworks are exposed for supply in other circumstances (such as the 
internet, mail order, etc.) the person who supplies such fireworks is required to give 
233 Fireworks Regulations 2004 reg 6. 234 Fireworks Regulations 2004 reg 7(1). ‘Night hours’ is defined as the period beginning 11pm and 
ending 7am the following day: reg 7(3). 235 ‘Permitted fireworks night’ is defined in reg 7(3). 236 Fireworks Regulations 2004 reg 7(2). 237 Fireworks Regulations 2004 reg 9(1). 238 Fireworks Regulations 2004 reg 9(2). 239 Fireworks Regulations 2004 reg 9(2A). 240 Fireworks Regulations 2004 reg 9(3). 241 SI 2014/1638. 242 Fireworks Regulations 2004 reg 9(4). 243 Fireworks Regulations 2004 reg 9(5). 244 Fireworks Regulations 2004 reg 9(8). 245 Fireworks Regulations 2004 reg 10(1). The relevant required information is that it is illegal to sell 
category F2 fireworks or category F3 fireworks to anyone under the age of eighteen and that it is illegal 
for anyone under the age of eighteen to possess either category F2 fireworks or category F3 fireworks 
in a public place; Fireworks Regulations 2004 reg 10(2).91

that information to the person to whom the fireworks are supplied, or exposed for 
supply. Subject to certain exceptions, suppliers of adult fireworks are required to 
maintain a record for a period of three years, inter alia, of the name and address of the 
person to whom the fireworks is being supplied (subject to certain exceptions) and 
the date when the firework was supplied to them.246 Subject to certain exceptions, 
a person who supplies adult fireworks is required, if requested by a local licensing 
authority, to provide any of such information to that authority, as is specified in the 
request.247
The Regulations also require the importer of any firework to provide customs and 
excise with certain information, including the name and address of the person who 
is to store the fireworks following their importation.248
As far as Scotland is concerned, the Fireworks (Scotland) Regulations 2004249
make provision for the safe use of fireworks.
The use of adult fireworks250 outside permitted hours251 is prohibited.252 The ban on 
the use of fireworks outside these hours is subject to certain exceptions.253 The supply 
of adult fireworks is also prohibited outside permitted hours.254 However, the ban is 
subject to certain exceptions.255 The supply of fireworks in specified circumstances 
and in excess of the permitted quantity256 at any one time is also prohibited.257 Again, 
the ban is subject to certain exceptions.258
A local authority can grant a dispensation from the prohibition of the use of 
adult fireworks to any person mentioned in reg 3(2) to enable that person to use 
fireworks: (a) for the purpose of putting on a fireworks display, for their employer 
or in the course of their business (as the case may be); or (b) at a national public 
celebration or a national commemorative event.259 The relevant person is any person 
who is employed by, or in business as, a professional organiser or operator of firework 
displays.260 However, a local authority may not grant such a dispensation unless it is 
satisfied either: (a) that there is no risk that the use of fireworks, in accordance with the 
dispensation, will have any of the consequences mentioned in s 2(2) of the Fireworks 
Act 2003; or (b) that the use of fireworks, in accordance with the dispensation, will 
have any such consequences. This is the minimum that is compatible with their being 
used.261 An application for a dispensation requires to be made to the local authority

The Fireworks and Pyrotechnic Articles (Scotland) Act 2022 provides inter alia
for fireworks licensing, as well as the restriction of supply and use of certain fireworks 
and pyrotechnic articles. The Act also makes provision for firework control zones.
PYROTECHNIC ARTICLES
Directive 2013/29/EU, which is a harmonisation measure, is aimed at harmonising 
the free movement of pyrotechnic articles (including fireworks) within the EU and 
also addresses securing a high level of protection of human health and safety and 
the protection of consumers and professional end users.264 Furthermore, in ensuring 
a high level of protection, pyrotechnic articles are categorised by the manufacturer 
according to their type of use or their purpose and level of hazard, including their 
noise level.265
Category F1 fireworks are fireworks that present a very low hazard and negligible 
noise level, for use in confined areas. Category F2 fireworks are fireworks that present 
a low hazard and low noise level and are intended for outdoor use in confined areas. 
Category F3 fireworks are fireworks that present a medium hazard, which are 
intended for outdoor use in large open areas and whose noise level is not harmful to 
human health. Category F4 fireworks are fireworks that present a high hazard and 
which are intended for use only by persons with specialist knowledge (commonly 
known as fireworks for professional use) and whose noise level is not harmful to 
human health.
The Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015266 implement the 2013 
Directive and also Directive 2014/58/EU on the traceability of pyrotechnic articles.
Before placing a pyrotechnic article267 on the market, a manufacturer must 
categorise it using the categories set out in Schedule 1 (categories of pyrotechnic 
article) according to its type of use or purpose and level of hazard, including its noise 
level.268 The manufacturer is also required to ensure that it has been designed and 
manufactured in accordance with the essential safety requirements.269 The essential 
safety requirements are contained in Schedule 2 to the Regulations and provide inter 
alia that the manufacturer of a firework is required to assign fireworks to different 
categories, categorised by net explosive content, safety distances, noise level or similar. 
The relevant category is also required to be indicated on the label of the firework. 
Specific conditions are required to be met in relation to each category of firework, 
namely, categories, categories one to four.

Before a pyrotechnic article can be placed on the market the manufacturer is required 
to ensure that it is labelled visibly, legibly and indelibly, is clearly understandable and is 
in English.270 The labelling of a pyrotechnic article must contain certain information, 
including the name, registered trade name or registered trademark of the manufacturer 
and the name, type and category of the pyrotechnic article.271
The Regulations also require a manufacturer to maintain a record of certain 
information of the pyrotechnic article, including the site of manufacture.272
The manufacturer is also required to provide the enforcing authority with that 
information.273 The manufacturer is also required to keep a register that contains 
certain information.274 Any entry made in the register requires to be kept for a period 
of at least ten years.275
The Regulations also make provision as to the minimum age of persons to whom 
categories one to three fireworks can be supplied.276 Category 4 fireworks cannot 
be supplied, except to a person with specialist knowledge.277 The supply of certain 
category 2 and 3 fireworks is also prohibited.278
The relevant local authority (weights and measures) is responsible for enforcing 
the Regulations in relation to categories one to three, inclusive, fireworks.279 The 
Health and Safety Executive is responsible for enforcing the Regulations in relation 
to category 4 fireworks.
The Regulations make provision for a variety of offences, including making it an 
offence for a manufacturer to contravene, or to fail to comply, with any requirement 
of reg 7 (design and manufacture in accordance with essential safety requirements) 
and regs 11 and 12 (labelling of pyrotechnic articles).280
It is also made an offence for a distributor to contravene or fail to comply inter 
alia with reg 25 (requirements that must be satisfied before a distributor makes an 
article available on the market) and reg 26 (prohibition on making available on the 
market where a pyrotechnic article is not considered to be in conformity with the 
essential safety requirements).281
BYELAWS
Prior to the passing of the Noise Abatement Act 1960, the sole legislative control in 
relation to noise took the form of byelaws. It was during the Victorian era, when the 
Industrial Revolution was at its zenith, that byelaws began to be made to a significant 
extent. Byelaws were generally directed at specific types of noise, for example, street 
noise. The content of such byelaws often provides the historian with valuable primary 
270 Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015 reg 11(1). 271 Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015 reg 11(2), Schedule 3. 272 Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015 reg 20(4). 273 Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015 reg 20(2). 274 Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015 reg 21(2). 275 Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015 reg 21(3). 276 Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015 reg 31. 277 Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015 reg 32. 278 Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015 reg 33. 279 Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015 reg 52(1). 280 Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015 reg 62(1). 281 Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015 reg 62(3).NOISE AND NOISE LAW

evidence of the social, as well as the environmental conditions, that were present 
during the period. For example, the byelaw challenged collaterally (that is, in legal 
proceedings) in the celebrated case of Kruse v Johnson282 purported to prohibit the 
playing of musical instruments or singing in any public place within fifty yards of any 
dwelling house, after being ordered by any constable, or any inmate of such house 
to desist.
The council of a district and the council of any London borough may make 
bylaws for the good rule and government of any part of the district or borough, for 
the suppression of nuisances therein.283 However, byelaws may not be made under 
the Act for any purpose, as respects any area, if provision for that purpose, as respects 
that area, is made by or is, or may be made under, any other enactment.284 In Scotland, 
local authorities have similar power under s  201(1) of the Local Government 
(Scotland) Act 1973. Such power is ostensibly wide and is indeed only circumscribed 
by the requirement of reasonableness285 and consistency with both the common and 
statutory law.286
INDUSTRIAL NOISE
Noise from various industrial sources has the potential to have a negative impact on 
the community. Pollution from industry will normally fall within the scope of the EU 
Industrial Emissions Directive.287 One of the main aims of the Directive is to ensure 
the prevention and control of pollution by providing that each installation should 
only operate if it holds a permit or if it is registered.288 Under the Directive ‘pollution’ 
includes noise that is harmful to human health or the quality of the environment.289
Member States are placed under an obligation to ensure that no installation or 
combustion plant, waste incineration plant or waste co-incineration plant is operated 
without a permit.290 A competent authority is required to grant a permit only if 
the installation complies with the requirements of the Directive.291 Installations are 
required to be operated in accordance with certain principles.292 These principles 
are that all appropriate preventative measures are taken against pollution; the best 
available techniques293 are applied; and that no significant pollution is caused. A 
permit condition (which could relate to noise) is required to include measures 
necessary to secure compliance with these principles.294

Neighbourhood Noise
The Directive has been implemented by the Pollution Prevention and Control 
(Scotland) Regulations 2012295 and the Environmental Permitting (England and 
Wales) Regulations 2016.296
WASTE 
Under the EU’s Waste Framework Directive297 Member States were required to 
establish a framework to prevent, reduce and, in so far as is reasonably possible, 
eliminate from the outset, the sources of pollution or nuisance by adopting relevant 
measures in its management of waste.298
In England and Wales waste management activities are regulated through the 
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016299 regime that 
has just been described. The Environment Agency has the vast majority of regulatory 
control over such activities.
In Scotland all waste management operations require a licence. Essentially, the 
EPA allows the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) to regulate 
waste treatment facilities by means of a licensing system. SEPA has wide powers 
as to the nature of the conditions that it can attach to a waste management licence. 
Under the EPA a licence is required to be granted on such terms, and also subject 
to such conditions as appear to SEPA to be appropriate.300 The Scottish Ministers 
are empowered to make regulations governing the conditions that are, or are not, to 
be included in a licence.301 The conditions that SEPA could include in the relevant 
licence could relate to noise from the relevant premises. 
Certain waste management activities in Scotland fall to be regulated by SEPA 
under the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2012.302
Landfill sites in Scotland are regulated by SEPA under the Landfill (Scotland) 
Regulations 2003 by means of a permitting system.303 SEPA can effectively regulate 
the day-to-day operation of a landfill site by including conditions in the relevant 
permit it grants. As far as the regulation of noise from landfill sites is concerned, a 
permit is required to include a condition that measures are required to be taken to 
295 SSI 2012/360. 296 SI 2016/1154. For a general discussion of Integrated Pollution, Prevention and Control and Permitting

minimise the nuisances and hazards arising from the landfill in relation to noise and 
traffic.304
HOUSEHOLD NOISE
The fact that many domestic properties are insufficiently insulated to prevent the 
transmission of noise has proved problematic over the years. We have already seen that 
noise from everyday domestic activities that affects neighbours does not constitute 
a nuisance in law.305 Ensuring that buildings have adequate sound insulation is the 
most effective means of securing that the residents of premises are protected against 
noise that emanates from outside the premises. 
As far as new buildings in England and Wales are concerned, the Building 
Regulations 2010306 provide that building work requires to be carried out so that it 
complies with the relevant provisions in Schedule 1 of the Regulations.307
Under Schedule 1 Part E1, dwelling houses, flats and rooms for residential 
purposes are required to be designed and constructed in such a way that they provide 
reasonable resistance to sound from other parts of the same building and from 
adjoining buildings. 
Under Schedule 1 Part E2, subject to certain exceptions, dwelling houses, flats 
and rooms for residential purposes are required to be designed and constructed in 
such a way that: (a) internal walls between a bedroom or a room containing a water 
closet and other rooms; and (b) internal floors, provide reasonable resistance to sound.
Under Schedule 1 Part E3, the common internal parts of a building that contain 
flats or rooms, for residential purposes, are required to be designed and constructed 
in such a way as to prevent more reverberation around the common part than is 
reasonable. However, this provision only applies to corridors, stairwells, hallways and 
entrance halls that give access to the flat or room for residential purposes.
Under Schedule 1 Part E4, as far as schools are concerned, each room or other 
space in a school building is required to be designed and constructed in such a way 
that it has acoustic conditions and the insulation against disturbance by noise that is 
appropriate to its intended use.
An individual carrying out building work in relation to which Schedule 1 Part 
E1 imposes a requirement, or in relation to work that is required to be carried out to 
an existing building to ensure that it complies with Schedule 1 Part E1 by virtue of 
reg 6(1)(f ) (requirements in relation to material change of use of the whole building) 
or reg 6(2)(b) (requirements in relation to material change of use of only part of 
the building) is required to ensure that appropriate sound testing is carried out in 
accordance with a procedure approved by the Secretary of State.308 A copy of the 
results of the testing also requires to be given to the relevant local authority. However, 
this requirement does not apply (provided certain conditions are met) where the 
building work consists of the erection of a dwelling house or a building containing 
304 SSI 2003/235 reg 10(3) and Schedule 3. 305 See p. 32 above. 306 SI 2010/2214. 307 SI 2010/2214 reg 4(1). 308 SI 2010/2214 reg 41(1), (2).97

flats, if the person carrying out the works notifies the local authority, before the 
work commences, that in order to meet the requirements of Schedule 1 Part E1, the 
person is using one or more of the design details approved by Robust Details Ltd.309
The Robust Details Scheme is the alternative to pre-completion sound testing for 
satisfying the requirements of Part E of the Building Regulations. Using the scheme 
avoids the uncertainties of pre-completion sound testing.
A local authority may make such tests of any building works as may be necessary 
to establish that the work complies with the requirements of Schedule 1.310
As far as Scotland is concerned, the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004311
requires buildings to be built in such a way as to limit the transmission of source 
noise from normal domestic type activities between such areas to a level that will not 
threaten the health of, or cause inconvenience to, the building occupants.312 However, 
this standard only applies to a building in different occupation, incorporating: (a) a 
detached dwelling; (b) attached residential buildings; or (c) a roof, walkway or access 
deck located directly above an area that is either a dwelling or a residential building.
Furthermore, every building must be designed and constructed in such a way as 
to limit the transmission of source noise from domestic type activities through a wall 
or floor between a room and internal space where noise is likely to occur to a level 
that will cause inconvenience to the building occupants.313 However, this standard 
only applies to a wall or floor forming an apartment in a dwelling and a room in a 
residential building that is capable of being used for sleeping other than: (a) a wall 
between an ensuite bathroom and an apartment or room it serves; (b) a hospital; or 
(c) a place of lawful detention.
BS 8233 (2014) provides guidance on the control of noise in and around buildings. 
It applies to the design of new buildings or refurbished buildings undergoing a 
change of use. However, it does not provide guidance on assessing the effects of 
changes in the external noise levels to occupants in an existing building. 
The Code for Sustainable Homes was launched by the UK Government in 2006 
for use in the design and construction of new homes with a view to encouraging 
continuous improvement in sustainable home building. The code is now voluntary.
NOISE FROM MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT
The Noise Emission in the Environment by Equipment for use Outdoors Regulations 
2001314 (which extends to the whole of the UK) makes provision for the control of 
noise from machinery and equipment. The Regulations apply to a wide range of 
equipment, from concrete breakers and picks, dumpers, excavators, landfill compactors 
and lawnmowers to power generators.315 However, the Regulations do not apply to 
309 SI 2010/2214 reg 41(4). 310 SI 2010/2214 reg 45. 311 SI 2004/406. 312 SI 2004/406 Schedule 5, para 1. 313 SI 2004/406 Schedule 5, para 2. 314 SI 2001/1701. The Regulations implement Directive 2000/14/EC the purpose of which was inter alia
to harmonise the laws of Member States relating to noise emission standards in relation to equipment 
for outdoor use: art 1. 315 SI 2001/1701 reg 3, Schs 1 and 2.NOISE AND NOISE LAW

equipment placed on the market or put into service on or before 2 January 2002 that 
comply with any provisions that they would have been required to comply for them 
to be placed on the market in the UK on 2 July 2001.316 A manufacturer of thirty-five 
categories of outdoor equipment is required to affix a label to the relevant product 
that shows its guaranteed sound power level, which is measured in accordance with 
the Regulations.317 Furthermore, a manufacturer of a further twenty-two categories 
(within the thirty-five categories) of outdoor equipment is required to ensure that 
the guaranteed sound power level of the equipment does not exceed the permissible 
sound level for that product, as defined in the Regulations.318 The guaranteed sound 
power level also requires to be marked on that equipment.
NOISE FROM HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES
Noise from household appliances in dwellings can be a source of annoyance to 
neighbours, especially in flatted property.319 The Household Appliances (Noise 
Emission) Regulations 1990320 (which apply to the whole of the UK) apply to a 
range of appliances for use in dwellings, including appliances used for cleaning, 
the preparation and storage of food stuffs, heaters and air conditioners.321 The 
Regulations prohibit the manufacturer or importer of any appliance (which has been 
manufactured or imported by them on or after 28 February 1990) from marketing 
any appliance that has either been manufactured or imported by them, unless the 
requirements of the Regulations have been complied with.322 The Regulations require 
a manufacturer or importer of an appliance who takes any steps to inform any person 
to whom the appliance is to be, or may be, marketed of the level of airborne noise 
that is emitted by the appliance, that level requires to be determined in accordance 
with the Regulations.323 The relevant level requires to be stated in a manner that 
is readily understandable by any person to whom the appliance is to be, or may 
be, marketed.324 The relevant weights and measures department is responsible for 
enforcing the Regulations within its area.325
It is made an offence, subject to a penalty, to fail to comply with the Regulations 
without reasonable excuse.326

Chapter 7
Noise and Human Rights
INTRODUCTION
In this chapter we discuss the role human rights jurisprudence plays in relation to the 
control of noise. Human rights law has an important role in this respect, given the 
limitations of both common law and statutory nuisance, to secure redress by those 
affected by noise. For example, in the House of Lords case of Baxter v Camden LBC 
(No 2)1 a tenant who resided in a block of flats that was owned by a local authority, 
raised an action against the authority, inter alia, on the grounds that, by reason of 
poor sound insulation in both the walls and ceilings which separated the various flats, 
she could hear almost everything her neighbours were doing. Whereas the claimant 
was being subjected to severe annoyance, the House of Lords held that the state 
of affairs did not rank as a nuisance on the grounds that the noise in question was 
everyday noise – that is to say, noise that was created by the ordinary (as opposed 
to the unreasonable) use by her neighbours of their respective properties. Another 
important limitation of the law of nuisance is that in order to be able to successfully 
raise an action in terms of the law of nuisance the claimant is required to have a 
proprietary interest in the land that is adversely affected by the adverse state of affairs, 
for example, noise.2
We now discuss the extent to which human rights jurisprudence can be enlisted 
by those who are affected by noise to secure redress.
The Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) incorporates the European Convention of 
Human Rights (ECHR) into UK law.3
 Under art 8 and art 1 of the First Protocol 
of the ECHR have been invoked on a number of occasions by those affected by 
various forms of pollution, including noise.
Article 8 provides:
(1) Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and 
his correspondence.
(2) There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of 
this right except such as in accordance with the law and is necessary in a 
democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the 
economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime,

for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and 
freedom of others. 
Article 1 of the First Protocol provides:
“Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No 
one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the 
conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.”
UK CASES
Almost all of the UK cases on the subject of noise and human rights have related 
to noise from aviation. We look now at noise from military aviation and then noise 
from civil aviation.
Military aviation
In Dennis v Ministry of Defence,
4 which we have already discussed in the context 
of the law of nuisance, the claimants resided in a large estate. RAF Wittering was 
situated about two miles from the estate. RAF Wittering was used as a training base 
for Harrier Jump Jets. The Harrier was5
 a noisy aircraft. Indeed, at the time there 
was none noisier. The claimants alleged that the noise constituted an interference 
with their rights under the HRA. The claimants relied on art 8 and art 1 of the First 
Protocol of the HRA. Buckley J was prepared to hold that the noise from the aircraft 
infringed both art 8 and art 1 of the First Protocol to the ECHR, first, by virtue of 
the noise in question being sufficiently loud, and second, by dint of the effect of the 
noise on the market value of the property.
Noise from military aircraft formed the basis of Jones v Ministry of Defence.
6
 In 
that case, the claimants, Mr and Mrs Jones (‘J’) resided in Anglesey. J owned property 
(known as ‘Parc Cefni’), which was situated on the south shore of a reservoir that was 
situated in the centre of Anglesey. J intended to develop the land in order to create a 
holiday and leisure park. A mile to the west of Parc Cefni there was situated Mona 
Airfield (the airfield). The airfield had been used by the Royal Air Force as a relief 
landing ground for the nearby base at RAF Valley, and also as runway where trainee 
pilots undertook circuit drills using fast jets and turbo prop aircraft. J claimed that 
an increase in the noise, which had been created by the operations in and around the 
airfield since 2007, had blighted their land. J claimed that the noise constituted an 
actionable nuisance or, alternatively, that the noise had infringed their rights under 
art 8 and art 1 of the First Protocol to the ECHR. J sought a remedy by way of a 
declaration and/or damages.
J claimed that the overflying aircraft constituted a failure on the part of the 
Ministry of Defence to respect J’s private and family life and their home. The judge 
held that the aircraft noise had disturbed J’s lives and their home. However, in his 
view, such interference was in accordance with the law and was also in the interests 
of national security. He rejected J’s submissions that the MoD’s activities were

5 The Harrier was decommissioned in 2014.

Noise and Human Rights
unreasonable and disproportionate. The judge held that the training of air force pilots 
and promoting cordial relations with our allies engaged the interests of national 
security.7
However, a more difficult question was whether a proper balance had been struck 
between the competing requirements of national security and J’s human rights, such 
as to justify the conclusion that the interference was necessary. The judge held that 
a balance had been lawfully struck in the instant case for two reasons.8
 The first 
reason was that the MoD operated a noise amelioration scheme for householders 
affected by noise. The public purse afforded relief to those most affected by noise. The 
reason why J did not qualify for such assistance was that they had not established 
that the noise was sufficiently loud. The second reason was that the MoD had taken 
steps to minimise the noise of overflying jets. Pilots had been instructed to avoid the 
most sensitive parts of J’s property. The judge rejected a possible suggestion that if a 
private individual’s interests were being interfered with because of a public interest 
the individual was bound to be compensated.9
 The judge concluded that a breach 
of art 8 had not taken place.
The judge then went on to address J’s claim in terms of art 1 of Protocol 1. The 
judge stated that ‘peaceful’ in the Protocol meant without interference.10 It did not 
mean ‘without noise’. J submitted that their possessions had been interfered with 
by aircraft noise. The judge held that J had invested in their land with the hope of 
running a profitable future business. However, that hope did not represent a hope 
that was capable of being protected by art 1.11 In short, no breach of art 1 of Protocol 
1 had taken place.12
Civil aviation
Noise from civil aviation formed the basis of Hatton v United Kingdom.
13 Essentially, 
an action was brought against the UK Government by a group of residents who lived 
under the flightpath of aircraft that used Heathrow Airport. The residents claimed 
that the government policy on night flights by aircraft at Heathrow flouted their 
rights under art 8 of the ECHR. 
The Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights recognised the 
principle that art 8 of the ECHR did not confer the right to a clean and quiet 
environment.14 However, the court held that where an individual was both directly 
and seriously affected by noise, or some other form of pollution, it was possible that 
art 8 could be engaged. The court went on to state that art 8 could be contravened 
either by a positive act on the part of the government or by its failure to protect its 
citizens from pollution.15 In both contexts regard was to be had to the fair balance

In that case, the claimants were owners of property situated near Heathrow Airport. They claimed NOISE AND NOISE LAW
102
to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and of the community 
as a whole. Furthermore, in both contexts the state enjoyed a certain margin of 
appreciation in determining the steps that required to be taken to ensure compliance 
with the ECHR. The margin of appreciation varied in the context of a particular 
case.16 The court was required to determine whether the UK had struck a fair 
balance between the economic well-being of the UK as a whole, and the interests of 
those who were affected by the noise.17 The court held that whereas environmental 
protection should be taken into consideration by governments acting within their 
margin of appreciation, and by the courts in reviewing that margin, in the instant 
case it was not appropriate for the court to adopt a special approach by reference to a 
special status of environmental human rights.18 The court also considered it relevant 
that those affected by noise could move elsewhere without financial loss.19
In the last analysis, the court found that there had been no violation of art 8 by 
the UK government.20
‘Non-aviation’ human rights case law
We now discuss cases other than those concerning the application of art 8 in terms 
of noise from aviation.
In Lopez Ostra v Spain21 Lopez Ostra (LO) lived with her family in Lorca, 
Spain. The town of Lorca had a heavy concentration of leather industries. Several 
tanneries, all belonging to the same company, had a plant for the treatment of liquid 
and solid waste, which had been built with a state subsidy on municipal land twelve 
metres away from the applicant’s home. The plant had begun operating in 1988 
without a licence, as was required by national legislation. Shortly after the plant had 
commenced operation it released gas fumes, pestilential smells and contamination 
that caused health problems and nuisance to many people in Lorca, particularly 
those living in the applicant’s district. The town council had evacuated the residents 
and had rehoused them, free of charge, during the summer and early autumn of 
that  the noise in question flouted their respective rights under art 8 of the ECHR. However, the 
court held that it had no jurisdiction to determine whether the noise from aircraft using the airport 
contravened the claimants’ rights. The court stated, however, a national government acted within a wide 
margin of appreciation in deciding how aircraft noise should be controlled. It was not for the court to 
substitute for the assessment of the national authorities any other assessment of what might be the best 
policy in that difficult social and technical sphere: at [43]. 16 (2003) 37 EHRR 28 at [103]. 17 (2003) 37 EHRR 28 at [121], [122]. 18 In Fadayeva v Russia (2007) 45 EHRR 10 where the court was required to decide whether the state 
had taken sufficient steps to prevent the claimant from being affected by pollution from a steel plant, 
the court held that in such cases the state enjoyed a wide margin of discretion in terms of art 8(2): at 
[134]. See also Dmitriyev v Russia Application No. 17840/06 at [53] where the court held that the 
state enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in balancing the rights of the individual against those of 
the community. 19 (2003) 37 EHRR 28 at [127]. 20 (2003) 37 EHRR 28 at [130]. For a discussion of Hatton, see A. Brown ‘Article 8 noise pollution’

Noise and Human Rights
1988. In September the town council had ordered the cessation of one of the plant’s 
activities but had allowed another to continue. LO had raised an action in the local 
court seeking protection of her fundamental rights. LO had complained inter alia
of an unlawful interference with her home and her peaceful enjoyment of it. She 
requested that the court order the temporary or permanent cessation of its activities. 
However, the court had held that notwithstanding the fact that the plant had caused 
a nuisance by virtue of smells, fumes and repetitive noise, it had not infringed the 
fundamental rights claimed. LO appealed to the Supreme Court claiming that the 
polluting fumes, smells and repetitive noise had caused both her and her daughter 
health problems. In 1989 the Supreme Court dismissed her appeal. LO appealed 
against this decision to the European Court of Human Rights.
LO claimed that her rights in terms of art 8 of the ECHR had been violated. 
The Court held that severe environmental pollution could affect an individual’s 
well-being and prevent them from enjoying their homes in such a way as to affect 
their private and family life adversely without, however, seriously endangering their 
health.22 Whether the question was analysed in terms of a positive duty on the 
state to take reasonable and appropriate measures to secure the applicant’s rights 
under art 8(1) as LO wished, or in terms of an interference by a public authority 
to be justified in accordance with art 8(2), the applicable principles were broadly 
similar.23 That was to say, in both contexts, regard had to be had to the fair balance 
that required to be struck between the competing interests of the individual and 
that of the community as a whole. In any case, the state enjoyed a certain margin of 
appreciation. Furthermore, even in relation to positive obligations under art 8(1) in 
striking such a balance, art 8(2) might be of certain relevance.
The Court concluded by deciding that the state had not struck a fair balance 
between the interest of the town’s economic well-being in having a waste-treatment 
plant and the applicant’s effective enjoyment of her right to respect for her home and 
her private and family life.24 There had been a violation of art 8.
Gomez v Spain25 provides a good example of persons affected by noise invoking 
human rights law to recure redress. In that case, Ms Gomez (G) lived in a flat that 
was situated in a residential quarter of Valencia. Since 1974 Valencia City Council 
(VCC) had allowed licensed premises such as bars, pubs and discotheques to open 
in the vicinity of her home, making it impossible for people who lived in the area to 
sleep. G claimed that this state of affairs amounted to a breach of art 8 of the ECHR 
on the grounds that, whereas VCC was not the direct source of the noise, VCC has 
caused the adverse state of affairs in question to come into existence by issuing an 
unlimited number of licenses without taking the requisite measures to comply with 
the law. G further claimed that the level of night-time disturbance that had been 
caused by more than 127 nightclubs infringed the right to health as indicated by 
the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. The court held that a breach of 
art 8 could take place by the intrusion of noise into the home.26 Indeed, a serious 
breach of a person’s right to respect for their home could take place if it prevented

them from enjoying the amenities of their home. The court went on to state that 
whereas the object of art 8 was essentially to protect the individual against arbitrary 
interference by public authorities, art 8 could place a duty on a public authority 
to adopt measures that were designed to secure respect for family life, even in the 
sphere of relations of individuals between themselves.27 However, in both contexts, 
regard was to be had to the fair balance that had to be struck between the competing 
interests of the individual and that of the community as a whole. As to whether the 
noise in question flouted art 8, it sufficed that the relevant maximum permitted level 
of noise had exceeded the permitted noise levels (which VCC itself had established 
through its byelaws) and had continued for a number of years.28 In conclusion, the 
court held that there had been a violation of art 8.29
In Dees v Hungary30 noise pollution from traffic formed the basis of the 
applicant’s (‘D’) claim to the European Court of Human Rights. D claimed that 
by virtue of the increase in volume of traffic on the road outside his house (which 
had been caused by trucks and other vehicles diverting past his house in order to 
stop paying a toll to use the local motorway) the house had become damaged by the 
vibrations from the traffic and had also become uninhabitable by the increased noise 
and vibrations. D claimed that as a consequence his rights under art 8 of the ECHR 
had been infringed. The court recognised that the ECHR protected the individual’s 
right to respect for their home, meaning not simply the individual’s right to the 
actual physical area, but also to the quiet enjoyment of that area within reasonable 
limits.31 Furthermore, breaches of the right to respect of the home were not confined 
to concrete breaches, such as the unauthorised entry into a person’s home, but could 
also include those that were diffuse such as noise, emissions, smells or other similar 
forms of interference. A serious breach could result in the breach of a person’s right to 
respect for their home if such a breach prevented them from enjoying the amenities 
of their home. The court stated that although the object of art 8 was essentially that 
of protecting the individual against arbitrary interference by public authorities, it 
could also involve the authorities adopting measures designed to secure respect for 
private life and home, even in the sphere of the relations of individuals between 
themselves.
The court noted that the state had introduced certain measures to mitigate the 
noise from vehicles near D’s home.32 The court went on to recognise that the state 
enjoyed a certain margin of appreciation in determining the steps that were required 
to be taken in order to ensure compliance with the ECHR when it came to the 
27 (2005) 41 EHRR 40 at [55]. 28 (2005) 41 EHRR 40 at [60], [61]. In Fadayeva (above, fn 18) the court held that the adverse effects of 
the relevant pollutant required to attain a minimum level in order to engage art 8. The assessment of 
that minimum level was relative and depended on all circumstances of the case such as the intensity 
and duration of the nuisance and also the physical and mental effects of the pollutant. The general 
context of the environment also required to be taken into account. Article 8 would not be infringed if 
the detriment complained of was negligible in comparison with the environmental hazards inherent to 
life in every modern city: (2007) 45 EHRR 10 at 311. See also Kapa v Poland (above, fn 23) at [153]. 29 (2005) 41 EHRR 40 at [63]. 30 (2013) 57 EHRR 12. 31 (2013) 57 EHRR 12 at [21]. 32 (2013) 57 EHRR 12 at [22].105
Noise and Human Rights
regulatory and other measures intended to protect art 8 rights.33 That consideration 
also applied in situations that did not concern a direct interference by public 
authorities with the right to respect for the home. The state also had a margin of 
appreciation involving the state’s failure to put a stop to third party breaches of the 
right that was relied on by D. In the instant case, the state was required to balance 
the interests of road users with those of the inhabitants of the surrounding areas. The 
court recognised the complexity of the state’s task in handling infrastructural issues, 
such as those in the instant case, where measures requiring considerable time and 
resources might be necessary. However, the court observed that the measures that 
had been taken by the authorities were insufficient, the upshot of which was that 
D had been exposed to excessive noise disturbance over a period of time. That had 
created a disproportionate individual burden for D. The court observed that since the 
noise pressure had significantly exceeded statutory levels, a state of affairs to which 
state measures had not responded appropriately could, of itself, amount to a violation 
of art 8.
In the last analysis, the court held that there had been a violation of art 8.34
Noise featured in Oluic v Croatia.
35 In that case, the applicant (‘O’) owned part 
of a house in Rijeka where she lived with her family. Since December 1999 a bar 
had been run by a third person in another part of the house. In 2001 O wrote to 
the Sanitary Inspectorate (SI) (a public authority responsible for noise nuisance 
abatement in the area where O lived) claiming that her flat had been constantly 
exposed to noise from the bar, which had been open from 7am until midnight. 
Measurements had been carried out in May 2001 by an independent expert firm of 
acousticians who found that the level of noise at night had exceeded the permitted 
level. Later in the year, the SI had ordered the company that owned the bar to 
reduce the level of noise from their equipment for the reproduction of music. The 
decision, however, was quashed by the Ministry of Health and was remitted to the 
SI. Further measurements were taken later. These measurements showed that noise 
from the bar exceeded the permitted levels. In 2002 the SI ordered the owner of the 
bar to add sound insulation to the walls and floor of the bar. However, a subsequent 
inspection revealed that the order had not been complied with. The SI then ordered 
an enforcement of the order. A subsequent inspection found that insulation had 
been installed but that it was insufficient. Further measurements that were taken 
of the noise from the bar in 2003 showed that the noise from the bar exceeded the 
permitted levels. Later in 2003 proceedings against the bar owner were terminated 
on the basis that the noise from the bar was not excessive. O then lodged an appeal 
that was dismissed by the administrative court, challenging the findings of the 
administrative bodies. Further measurements carried out in 2005 showed that the 
noise level in O’s flat exceeded the permitted level. O then lodged a complaint with 
the Supreme Court about the length of the proceedings before the administrative 
court. The complaint was accepted and the former ordered the latter to come to a 
decision within three months. In April 2007 the administrative court quashed the 
decisions of the lower bodies and ordered them to establish whether the noise from 
33 (2013) 57 EHRR 12 at [23]. 34 (2013) 57 EHRR 12 at [24]. 35 App. No. 61260/08, judgement 20 May 2010.NOISE AND NOISE LAW
106
the bar was still excessive. Later in the same year, a second-instance administrative 
body annulled the decisions that had been made in 2003 on the basis that the noise 
that came from the bar was excessive and also that the insulation between the flat 
and the bar was insufficient.
Between December 2007 and December 2008 the SI took more measurements, 
which showed that the level of noise was again excessive. In January 2009 the SI 
ordered the owner of the bar to reduce the noise level. However, a month later 
measurements showed that the noise levels had not exceeded the set standards. O 
then brought an action against the state, claiming that it had failed to protect her 
from the excessive noise that had emanated from the bar. 
First, the government argued that O had failed to exhaust to exhaust domestic 
remedies in the administrative proceedings.36 The court held, however, that before 
one could enlist the aid of the court one was required to make use of normal domestic 
remedies that were effective, sufficient and accessible.37 If there were a number of 
domestic remedies an individual could make use of any such remedies that addressed 
their essential grievance. In other words, when a remedy had been pursued there was 
no need for the applicant to pursue another remedy that had the same objective. 
In the instant case, the remedies that O had invoked were aimed at securing the 
same objective as the appropriate civil proceedings, namely abating the noise from 
the bar.38 Therefore, the applicant was not required at the same time to bring 
civil proceedings to bring a civil action or to use any other remedy. Therefore, the 
government’s argument that the applicant had failed to exhaust effective domestic 
remedies, in so far as it related to her failure to pursue a civil action against the owner 
of the bar, fell to be rejected.39
Second, the government maintained that the applicant had failed to use all 
available remedies in the administrative proceedings that had instituted and also that 
some of the proceedings were still pending.40
Third, the government claimed that the level of noise to which O had been 
exposed had not reached the necessary level of severity for art 8 to be engaged.41
Fourth, the government claimed that the present case concerned a dispute between 
two private individuals and not an interference by state authorities with any of the 
applicant’s rights which were protected under art 8.42 The court held, however, that 
both the exhaustion of domestic remedies in the administrative proceedings and the 
issue as to the applicability of art 8 to the circumstances of the case should be joined 
to the merits, since they were closely linked.43
The Court held that whereas there was no explicit right in the ECHR to a clean 
and quiet environment, where an individual was directly and seriously affected by 
noise or other pollution art 8 could be engaged.44 The Court went on to state that 
36 App. No. 61260/08 at [33]. 37 App. No. 61260/08 at [35]. 38 App. No. 61260/08 at [36]. 39 App. No. 61260/08 at [37]. 40 App. No. 61260/08 at [38]. 41 App. No. 61260/08 at [39]. 42 App. No. 61260/08 at [43]. 43 App. No. 61260/08 at [41]. 44 App. No. 61260/08 at [45].107
Noise and Human Rights
whereas art 8 was essentially aimed at protecting the individual against arbitrary 
interference by public authorities, it could involve the authorities adopting measures 
that were designed to secure respect for private life, even in the sphere of relations 
between private individuals themselves.45 However, in determining whether art 8 
had been breached, the applicable principles were broadly the same, namely, regard 
had to be paid to the competing interests of the individual and of the community, as 
a whole. The instant case concerned an allegation that the relevant public authority 
had failed to put a stop to third parties breaching O’s rights under art 8.46
The Court then went on to determine whether the noise to which O had been 
subjected contravened art 8. In order to contravene art 8 the noise was required to 
attain the minimum level of severity.47 The assessment of that minimum depended 
on all the circumstances of the case, such as the intensity and duration of the nuisance 
and its physical and mental effects. The Court considered the fact that the noise levels 
to which the applicant had been exposed had exceeded the permitted levels that had 
been set by the relevant byelaw, between 2001 and 2008.48 Furthermore, the Court 
took into account the fact that the noise from the bar had exceeded the international 
standards that had been set by the WHO and also most European countries.49 The 
Court then went on to hold that by virtue of both the volume of the noise, the fact 
that it had occurred during the night and had exceeded the permitted levels and had 
continued a number of years and also nightly, that the level of disturbance had reached 
the minimum level of severity that required the relevant authorities to implement 
measures in order to protect the applicant from such noise.50 The Court stated that 
the administrative authorities had delayed for a long period in taking remedial action 
against the owner of the bar.51 The administrative court had also delayed four years in 
reaching its decision. This delay in dealing with night-time disturbances had resulted 
in O suffering an infringement of her right to respect for her home. Furthermore, 
the level of noise that O had been exposed to for a number of years had reached the 
required level of severity for art 8 to be breached.52 The Court also observed that the 
national authorities had allowed this situation to persist for almost eight years while 
the various proceedings before the administrative authorities and the administrative 
court were pending, thus rendering these proceedings ineffective.
The Court held that in these circumstances the state had failed to discharge its 
positive obligation to guarantee O’s right to respect for her home and private life.53
Therefore, there had been a violation of art 8 of the ECHR.
First, Oluic reaffirms the fact that the European Court of Human Rights 
recognises the fact that noise that impacts on the enjoyment of one’s home is 
capable of flouting art 8 of the ECHR. Second, Oluic emphasises the point that 
in determining whether art 8 has been infringed not only is the Court entitled to 
45 App. No. 61260/08 at [46]. 46 App. No. 61260/08 at [48]. 47 App. No. 61260/08 at [49]. 48 App. No. 61260/08 at [54]–[59]. 49 App. No. 61260/08 at [60]. 50 App. No. 61260/08 at [62]. 51 App. No. 61260/08 at [63], [64]. 52 App. No. 61260/08 at [65]. 53 App. No. 61260/08 at [66].NOISE AND NOISE LAW
108
consider the relevant domestic law of the country in which the complainant lives, 
the Court is also entitled to take into account WHO environmental noise standards 
and also any acceptable noise levels other European countries have set. Third, Oluic
establishes the principle that one is not required to bring civil proceedings against 
the author of a noise nuisance before enlisting the aid of the European Court of 
Human Rights. Fourth, in determining whether art 8 had been contravened, the 
court is entitled to take into account the length of time the relevant domestic courts 
take to reach a decision concerning the relevant noise complaint.
Noise featured again in the interesting case of Zammit Meampel v Malta.
54
Every year, on the occasion of certain village feasts firework displays were set up 
in the fields, which were situated close to the applicants’ residence. The applicants 
(‘Z’) alleged that each time fireworks were let off from the area they were exposed 
to risk and peril to their life, physical health and personal security. Moreover, the 
heavy debris produced caused considerable damage to the residence. Z claimed 
inter alia that their rights under art 8 had been infringed by virtue of the Chief 
of Police having issued permits to allow fireworks to be let off near Z’s residence 
without Z having had the opportunity to comment on the matter, and also by the 
fact that the area had not been declared a restricted area following the advice of 
a group of experts. In consequence, they complained that they were suffering a 
disproportionate interference with their right to respect for their private life and 
home.
The Court stated that the noise in question was not caused by the state, or by 
organs of the state, in that the noise was created by private individuals.55 The Court 
stated that whereas the case could be seen as one that gave rise principally to the 
positive obligations of the state rather than an interference by the state, the Court 
was not required to finally decide the question since the test was essentially the 
same. That was to say, the question was whether the law, as applied in the present 
case, struck a fair balance between the competing rights of the individuals who 
were affected by the disturbance and the community as a whole. In order to justify 
the letting off of fireworks in the vicinity of Z’s property, the Maltese government 
referred not only to the cultural and religious interests of the Maltese community 
but also to the economic interests of the country as a whole.56 The Court observed 
that the state enjoyed a certain margin of appreciation in determining the steps that 
required to be taken to ensure compliance with the Convention when it came to the 
determination of regulatory, or other measures, that were intended to protect art 
8 rights. That position also held good in situations that did not concern the direct 
interference by public authorities with the right to respect for the home but involved 
the authorities’ failure to take action to put a stop to third party breaches of the right 
that was relied on by the applicant.57 The Court stated that in cases that involved 
environmental issues, as in the present case, the state required a wide margin of 
appreciation.58

Noise and Human Rights
The Court noted that the damage to Z’s property had been both minimal and 
reversible.59 Furthermore, whereas the mortality rate relating to the fireworks industry 
in Malta was alarming, such incidents occurred less frequently during fireworks 
displays than during the manufacture of fireworks. Z could have taken action against 
those responsible for the damage through ordinary civil proceedings. However, the 
Court accepted that the repeated letting off of fireworks, at sound levels reaching 
at least 120 decibels for two weeks each year, even though intermittently, created 
considerable inconvenience for Z. That inconvenience required to be balanced 
against the interests of the community. The Court accepted that in this context the 
authorities were entitled, having regard to the general nature of the measures taken, 
to identify distances from where third parties could perform the relevant displays, 
considering the geographical situation in Malta and its population density.60 The 
state had also addressed its mind to the dangers that were inherent in the use of 
fireworks and had provided for a certain degree of protection.61 Quite apart from 
the regulation of firework displays by way of permitting, regulations were in place in 
respect of transporting and uploading of fireworks. The letting off of fireworks was 
monitored by police inspectors and firefighters. Insurance covering the activity was 
also mandatory. The Court added that in determining whether the correct balance 
had been struck between the rights of Z and of the community as a whole, the 
mitigation measures carried considerable weight. Furthermore, the Court set store 
by the fact that Z had been fully aware of the very state of affairs of which they 
complained before they had acquired their property.62 The Court held that that was 
a weighty factor in the relevant balancing exercise, irrespective of the fact that they 
were entitled to live there.
In the last analysis, the authorities had not overstepped their margin of appreciation 
by failing to strike a fair balance between the rights of individuals affected by those 
regulations to respect for their family life and home and the conflicting interests of 
others and of the community as a whole.63 Therefore, there had been no violation of 
art 8 by the State.
CONCLUSIONS
The courts have established the following general principles in relation to the 
application of art 8 of the ECHR in terms of noise.
First, noise that exceeds a certain level (which has been described by the courts 
as the ‘minimum level’) is capable of engaging art 8. Whether the minimum level 
has been exceeded depends on all circumstances of the case. The court can consider 
whether the creation of the noise has contravened national legislation, the intensity, 
duration, physical and mental effects of the noise, and also whether relevant noise 
exceeds WHO environmental noise guidelines and those of other European 
countries. These factors are not exhaustive.

Second, art 8 can be contravened by a positive act on the part of the state and also 
by the state’s failure to prevent its citizens from being affected by noise that has been 
caused by third parties.
Third, the state enjoys a fairly wide margin of appreciation in balancing the rights 
of the individual who has been affected by noise and those of the general community.111
Chapter 8
Transport Noise
AIRCRAFT NOISE
We turn our attention, first, to the regulation of noise from civil aircraft and second, 
to noise from military aircraft.
Civil aircraft
Aircraft can cause noise problems for the community when the aircraft is taking off 
or landing at an airport, when the aircraft is in flight or when it is manoeuvring or 
even stationary with engines or auxiliary power units running (generically described 
as ‘ground noise’). Therefore, the relevant statutory controls can roughly be divided 
into controls that relate to noise from the flight (or navigation) of aircraft, and 
controls that specifically relate to noise to aircraft from aerodromes. 
Flight noise
Given that the flight paths of aircraft during take-off and landing are often directly 
over houses and other occupied premises, the noise that is generated by aircraft may 
cause considerable annoyance to individuals who are living beneath such flightpaths. 
However, the Civil Aviation Act 1982 (the 1982 Act) provides that no action may 
lie in respect of either trespass or nuisance by reason only of the flight of an aircraft 
over any property at a height above the ground that, having regard to wind, weather 
and all the circumstances of the case, is reasonable, or the ordinary incidents of such 
flight, provided that the provisions of any Air Navigation Order and of any orders 
under s 621
 have been complied with.2
Furthermore, aircraft noise (from both civil and military aircraft) does not 
constitute a statutory nuisance, in terms of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 
(EPA).3
The application of s 76(1) of the 1982 Act to noise from helicopters fell to be 
discussed in the Court of Appeal case of Peires v Bickerton’s Aerodromes Ltd.

 In 
that case the claimant lived in close proximity to the defendant’s aerodrome. She 
brought an action for damages and an injunction to restrain the defendant from the

continuation of a nuisance, which she alleged was caused by noise from exercises 
that were carried out by helicopters, on that part of the aerodrome which was 
situated closest to her property. Those exercises were part of the mandatory training 
requirements for a helicopter pilot. The exercises in question consisted of helicopters 
landing, taking off, hovering, turning through 180 degrees and landing again. The 
defendant asserted that the claimant’s action was barred, inter alia, by s 76(1) of the 
Act. However, the trial judge rejected the statutory defence on the basis that s 76(1) 
of the Act was designed to cover journeys that consisted of aircraft passing over 
property. Therefore, the exercises, the noise from which was the subject matter of the 
action, did not amount to ‘flight’ in terms of the Act and the relevant orders. The trial 
judge, therefore, concluded that the noise in question amounted to a nuisance and 
granted an injunction that limited the helicopter exercises for a fixed duration during 
certain days of the week.5
The defendant successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal. The appeal 
essentially centred on the meaning of ‘flight’ in terms of the Act and the relevant 
orders. The court held that the expression ‘flight’ in that context was not confined to 
lateral travel by an aircraft from one fixed point to another.6
 Rather, the expression 
included an operation under which a helicopter rose a certain distance, then turned 
and landed.7
 Furthermore, there was nothing in s  76(1) of the Act that made it 
a precondition of immunity, which was conferred by the section, that the flight or 
the ordinary incidents of the flight, must be reasonable.8
 Rather, the only specified 
requirement as to reasonableness was in relation to the height of the aircraft ‘having 
regard to wind, weather, and all the circumstances of the case’. The trial judge had 
made no finding that the height of the aircraft was unreasonable having regard to 
these factors. In the instant case, the claimant’s action comprised a complaint that 
concerned both the frequency and the duration of the noise, rather than the height 
of the aircraft.
The appeal was, therefore, allowed.9
Section 60(3) allows Air Navigation Orders to be made, inter alia, as to the 
conditions under which and, in particular the aerodromes to or from which, aircraft 
entering or leaving the UK may fly, and as to the conditions under which aircraft 
may fly from one part of the UK to the other. Under the Air Navigation Order 
2016 the Secretary of State may make regulations known as Rules of the Air inter 
alia prescribing the manner in which aircraft move or fly.10 It is an offence to fail 
to comply with the Rules.11 The current rules of the air are the Rules of the Air 
Regulations 2015 (the Rules).12 The Rules prohibit inter alia the take off or landing 
of aircraft within a congested area of any city, town or settlement, except at an 
aerodrome, in accordance with procedures notified by the Civil Aviation Authority 
5 See (2016) 178 SPEL 143. 6 [2017] 1 WLR 2865 at 2874.

(the CAA).13 This provision could be used to prevent those living in the city, etc. 
from being affected by aircraft noise. 
Aircraft noise certification 
Whereas the potential noise problems from aircraft can be reduced by controlling 
the flight of aircraft flying over Britain, much more important is the requirement 
to reduce the noise that emanates from aircraft at source. Aircraft noise has been 
controlled, since the 1970s, by the setting of noise limits in the form of Standards 
and Recommended Practices (SARPS) contained in Annex 16 to the Convention 
on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago Convention).14 Noise provisions are 
contained in Volume 1 of Annex 16, which requires certain aircraft to be certified 
before being allowed to operate. The primary purpose of noise certification is to 
ensure that the latest available noise reduction technology is incorporated into 
aircraft design and that this is demonstrated by procedures that are relevant to day￾to-day operations. This will result in a reduction of noise around airports. In the UK 
noise certificates are issued by the CAA.
Before Brexit, the EU had made a number of Directives (which had been 
transposed into UK law) and Regulations, which were based on agreements 
that were made under the aegis of the ICAO. As far as the UK is concerned the 
relevant provisions of both the Chicago Convention and the relevant EU Directives 
are implemented by orders made under s 60(3)15 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982. 
EU Regulation 748/201216 also makes provision, inter alia, for the issue of noise 
certificates in relation to aircraft.
Propeller-driven aircraft
The Aeroplane Noise Regulations 199917 make provision for the noise certification 
for UK registered propeller-driven aeroplanes, falling within one of the categories 
set out in Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Chicago Convention. Subject to certain 
exceptions, such aircraft cannot be used in the UK unless there is in force in respect 
of that aeroplane a noise certificate that has been granted by the CAA.
Jet propelled aircraft
EU Regulation 2018/1139 provides that noise and emissions from aircraft require 
to comply with the environmental protection requirements, which are contained in 
13 Rules of the Air Regulations 2015 Schedule 1 s  3. See also EU Regulation No. 923/2012 of 
26 September 2012, SERA3105 (retained), which specifies minimum heights for aircraft flying over 
congested areas of inter alia cities, towns and settlements. 14 See https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Pages/Reduction-of-Noise-at-Source.aspx (last acces￾sed 27 October 2022). 15 The Civil Aviation Act 1982 s 60(3)(r) provides that an Air Navigation Order may make provision for 
prohibiting aircraft from taking off or landing in the UK unless there are in force in respect of those 
aircraft such certificates of compliance with standards as to noise as may be specified in the Order and 
except upon compliance with the conditions of those certificates. 16 EU retained legislation. 17 SI 1999/1452 reg 4.NOISE AND NOISE LAW

Volume 1 of Annex 16 of the Chicago Convention.18 As far as the UK is concerned, 
the CAA is required to ensure, inter alia, that in exercising its functions (which would 
include the noise certification of aircraft) that the CAA conforms with the provisions 
of the Chicago Convention.19 Furthermore, the CAA is required to ensure that it is 
required to receive and assess applications that are made to it, in accordance with the 
provisions of Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Chicago Convention.20
Non-Part 21 Aircraft
The Air Navigation (Environmental Standards for Non-Part 2121 Aircraft) Order 
2008 makes provision for the noise certification of Non-Part 21 aircraft.22 Under the 
Order, subject to certain exceptions, a microlight aircraft may not land or take off in 
the UK unless there is in force for the aeroplane a noise certificate, and any conditions 
subject to which the certificate was issued have been complied with.23 In the case 
of a microlight aircraft that is registered in the UK the noise certificate requires to 
be issued by the CAA.24 The Order also makes provision for UK registered state 
aircraft, or research aircraft, for which there is no Part 21 equivalent type.25 No such 
aircraft may take off or land in the UK unless there is in force for that aircraft a noise 
certificate issued by the CAA in accordance with the Order, and any conditions 
subject to which the certificate was issued, have been complied with.26
AERODROME NOISE
The CAA is placed under a duty under s 5(1) of the 1982 Act when it exercises 
any aerodrome licensing or certification function,27 in relation to an aerodrome that 
has been specified in an order that has been made by the Secretary of State for 
the purposes of s 5, to have regard to the need to minimise, so far as is reasonably 
practicable, any adverse effects on the environment and any disturbance to the public 
from inter alia, noise and vibration.

of aircraft; SI 2008/3133 art 3. 26 SI 2008/3133 art 7(2). 27 One of the CAA’s functions is to license aerodromes: 1982 Act s 3. A licensing function is a function 
that is carried out by the CAA under an Air Navigation Order with respect to the licensing of 
aerodromes: ibid s 5(2). An aerodrome certification function is a function carried out by the CAA under 
the Aerodromes Regulation with respect to the certification of aerodromes. ‘Aerodromes Regulation’ 
means Commission Regulation (EU) No 139/2014 laying down requirements and administrative 
procedures relating to aerodromes pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008.115
Transport Noise
Under s 77(1) of the 1982 Act provision may be made by an Air Navigation 
Order for regulating the conditions under which noise and vibration may be caused 
by aircraft on an aerodrome, and the Order may provide that s 77(2) (below) applies 
to such noise and vibration. Article 218(1) of the Air Navigation Order 2016 
provides that the Secretary of State may prescribe the conditions under which noise 
and vibration may be caused by aircraft (including military aircraft) on government 
aerodromes, national licensed aerodromes, certified aerodromes or on aerodromes at 
which the manufacture, repair or maintenance of aircraft is carried out by persons 
carrying on business as manufacturers or repairers of aircraft. Article 218(2) provides 
that s 77(2) applies to any aerodrome in relation to which the Secretary of State has 
prescribed conditions, in accordance with art 218(1).
Section 77(2) provides that no action may lie, in respect of the law of nuisance, 
by reason only of the noise and vibration of aircraft on the aerodrome, provided that 
the provisions of the Order are complied with.
Designated aerodromes
The 1982 Act gives the Secretary of State wide ranging control over aircraft noise 
from aerodromes that are designated as ‘designated aerodromes’. Aerodromes are so 
designated by way of an order made under s 80 of the Act.
Section 78(1) of the 1982 Act allows the Secretary of State (by way of a notice 
that is published in the prescribed manner) to place a duty on the operator of an 
aircraft, which is to take off or land at a designated aerodrome, to secure that after 
the aircraft either takes off or before it lands at the aerodrome certain requirements 
for limiting or mitigating the effect of noise and vibration from the aircraft (which 
are specified in the notice) are met. This power is used by the Secretary of State to 
determine the flight paths that aircraft are required to follow after taking off or 
landing at the airport to reduce the impact of aircraft noise on houses situated below 
the flightpaths.
The Civil Aviation (Notices) Regulations 197828 makes provision for the relevant 
notification procedure. Publication is effected by way of a notice published in the 
CAA publication entitled United Kingdom Air Pilot or Notam.29
Under s  78(2) if it appears to the Secretary of State that any requirement 
specified in relation to a designated aerodrome (and published in accordance with 
s 78(1)) has not been complied with as respects any aircraft, the Secretary of State 
may, after giving the operator of the relevant aircraft a hearing and also considering 
any representations made by the operator, direct the person managing the aerodrome 
that until the Secretary of State revokes their direction, facilities at the aerodrome 
are withheld to the extent specified in the direction from the aircraft of the operator. 
The person who is managing the aerodrome is placed under a duty to comply with 
the direction.
Furthermore, under s  78(3), if the Secretary of State considers it appropriate 
for the purpose of avoiding, limiting or mitigating the effect of noise and vibration 
connected with the taking off or landing of an aircraft at a designated aerodrome 
28 SI 1978/1303. 29 SI 1978/1303 reg 2.NOISE AND NOISE LAW

to prohibit aircraft from taking off or landing, or limit the number of occasions on 
which aircraft take off or land at the aerodrome, during certain periods (for example, 
during the night) the Secretary of State is given wide power to take appropriate 
measures. The Secretary of State may, by a notice published in the prescribed manner, 
prohibit aircraft of descriptions specified in the notice from taking off or landing at 
the aerodrome (otherwise in an emergency of a description so specified) during the 
periods so specified. The Secretary of State may also specify the number of occasions 
on which specified aircraft may be permitted to take off or land at the aerodrome 
(otherwise in an emergency of a description so specified). The Secretary of State 
may also determine the persons who will be entitled to arrange for aircraft, of which 
they are operators, to take off or land at the aerodrome during the relevant periods 
and, in respect of each of these persons, the number of occasions on which aircraft 
of a particular description of which they are the operator may take off or land at 
the aerodrome during these periods. The person managing the aerodrome is placed 
under a duty to secure that the prohibitions or restrictions relating to the aerodrome, 
which are imposed by the notice, are complied with.
Under s 78(4) a particular occasion or series of occasions on which aircraft take 
off or land at an aerodrome fall to be disregarded for the purpose of s 78(3) in respect 
of that aerodrome, if:
(i) on that occasion, or series of occasions, the aircraft take off or land in 
circumstances specified, in relation to that aerodrome, by the Secretary in a 
notice which has been published in the prescribed manner; and
(ii) the person for the time being managing the aerodrome or a person authorised 
by him for the purpose, determines that the occasion, or series of occasions, 
should be so disregarded. In such circumstances, the person managing the 
aerodrome requires to notify the Secretary of State in writing, within a 
week of it occurring, of any occasion (whether a single occasion or series of 
occasions) to which s 78(4) applies.
The 1982 Act makes further provision in relation to s 78(3). Under s 78(5) a duty is 
placed on the Secretary of State, before they make a determination in relation to an 
aerodrome as to the persons who will be entitled to arrange for aircraft to take off 
or land at the aerodrome during specified periods, and the number of occasions on 
which aircraft of a particular description of which they are the operator, may take 
off or land at the aerodrome during these periods, the Secretary of State is required 
to consult any body appearing to them to be representative of operators of aircraft 
using the aerodrome.
Section 78(5) also gives the Secretary of State power, if it appears to them that an 
aircraft is about to take off in contravention of any prohibition or restriction imposed 
under s 78(3) to authorise any person to detain the aircraft for such period as that 
person considers appropriate for the purpose of preventing the contravention. Such 
a person may enter upon any land for that purpose. Similar powers are conferred on 
a person, authorised for the purpose (or in turn, a person authorised by that person) 
by the person who, for the time being, is managing the aerodrome. 
Section 78(5) of the 1982 Act further provides that the Secretary of State may, 
by notice given in the prescribed manner to the person managing an aerodrome to 
which a notice under s 78(3) relates, determine that a particular occasion, or series of 117
Transport Noise
occasions on which aircraft take off or land at an aerodrome, is to be disregarded for 
the purposes of a notice under that subsection.
The powers that the Secretary of State can exercise under s 78(3) formed the 
basis of R v Secretary of State.
30 In July 1993 the Secretary of State announced his 
intention to introduce a new system of night-time flying restrictions at Heathrow, 
Gatwick and Stansted airports, based on the amount of noise (using a quota system) 
that was produced by the aircraft used at the respective aerodromes. The upshot of 
such a policy would have been that it would have been possible for aircraft operators 
to increase the total number of take offs and landing movements by using quieter 
aircraft. The local authorities in the surrounding area challenged that policy by way 
of judicial review, claiming that individuals residing in the area would be adversely 
affected by the new regime if it came into force. It was held that it was not lawful 
for the Secretary of State to limit the number of night flights from a designated 
aerodrome by means of a quota system, based on the noise generated by the aircraft 
using the aerodrome, in contradistinction to the number of aircraft using the 
aerodrome.
In 2017 the UK government set out its policy in relation to night-time flights 
at the designated aerodromes for the period extending from 2017–2022.31 An 
environmental objective for that period was to limit, or reduce, the number of 
people significantly affected by noise at night, including through encouraging the 
use of quieter aircraft, while maintaining the existing benefits of night flights.32
The achievement of this objective is to be measured inter alia by employing a quota 
count33 per aircraft movement over the course of a season (i.e. summer and winter) 
and also the number of movements taking place during the night quota period.34
Under s 78(6) the Secretary of State may give to the person managing a designated 
aerodrome such directions as they consider appropriate for the purpose of avoiding, 
limiting or mitigating the effect of such noise and vibration connected with the 
taking off or landing of aircraft at the aerodrome. The person who at the time is 
managing the aerodrome is placed under a duty to comply with the directions.35
In order that noise at the designated aerodrome can be measured, s  78(8) of 
the 1982 Act allows the Secretary of State (after giving the person managing the 
aerodrome a hearing) by order, to require them at their own expense, inter alia, to 
provide, maintain and operate noise measuring equipment in the vicinity of the 
aerodrome in accordance with any specified instructions given by the Secretary of 
State. The person managing the aerodrome may also be required to make reports 
concerning the noise that has been measured by the equipment to the Secretary of 
30 [1994] 1 WLR 74. 31 Decision Document, Night Flight Restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted (Department of 
Transport, 2017). 32 Decision Document at 4. 33 A quota count (QC) is a classification based on certified noise levels that allocates a certain number of 
points (0–16) to an aircraft, that is to say the louder the aircraft the higher is the count. 34 The night period starts at 11pm and ends at 7am the following morning. Currently, Gatwick airport 
has an allowance of 11,200 movements and a 5,150 QC in the summer period, and 3,250 movements 
and a 1,785 QC in the winter. 35 Directions given under s 78(6) of the 1982 Act may be given for the purpose of avoiding, limiting or 
mitigating the effect of the noise and vibration either generally or in any particular area or areas: ibid
s 78(6A).NOISE AND NOISE LAW
118
State. The person who for the time being is managing the aerodrome is required to 
comply with the provisions of the order.
Section 78(9) makes provision for the case of the person who is managing the 
aerodrome failing to comply with the order. In such circumstances, the Secretary 
of State, after giving them a hearing, may inter alia take such steps as the Secretary 
of State considers appropriate for remedying the failure. The Secretary of State can 
also recover relevant expenses from the person managing the aerodrome. It is also an 
offence, subject to a penalty, to fail to comply with such an order.
To date, only Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted in London have been designated 
for the purposes of s 78 of the 1982 Act.36 At the time of writing37 there are no 
designated aerodromes for the purposes of either ss 78 or 79 in Scotland.
Noise preferential routes at airports
An important device to reduce the impact of noise on the ground on those living 
in the immediate vicinity of airports from aircraft taking off at the airports, is 
the use of noise preferential routes (NPRs).38 NPRs have been used by the UK 
Government, under s  78 of the 1982 Act, for the purpose of regulating noise at 
London’s designated airports.39 Some local authorities have also imposed special 
orders (containing NPR provisions) on non-designated airports, under s 106 of the 
Town and Country Planning Act 1990, to mitigate the noise impact from aircraft on 
local communities within their local authority areas. Furthermore, some airports, as 
good practice, have established NPRs on a voluntary basis.40
Noise control schemes – non designated aerodromes
An aerodrome operator41 may establish a noise control scheme under s 38A of the 
1982 Act for the purpose of avoiding, limiting or mitigating the effect of noise 
connected with the taking off or landing of aircraft at a non-designated aerodrome. 
A noise control scheme may:
(i) require operators of aircraft that are to take of or land at the airport to ensure 
that specific requirements (i.e. as specified in the scheme) are complied with 
in relation to the aircraft, either after they take off or land at the aerodrome;
(ii) prohibit aircraft of specified descriptions from taking off or landing at the 
aerodrome during specified periods; 
(iii) specify the maximum number of occasions on which aircraft of specified 
descriptions can take off or land at the aerodrome during specified periods; 
and
36 These aerodromes were designated under the Civil Aviation (Designation of Aerodromes) Order 1981 
(SI 1981/651), which was made under s 29 of the Civil Aviation Act 1971. The 1981 Order remains in 
force by virtue of the savings provisions contained in Schedule 14 to the 1982 Act. 37 June 2022. 38 See the Guidance to the Civil Aviation Authority on Environmental Objectives Relating to the Exercise of 
its Air Navigation Functions (Department of Transport, 2014) paras 5.1–5.14. 39 Guidance to the Civil Aviation Authority at para 5.15. 40 Routes conforming to the NPRs at designated and non-designated airports are published by the 
Department for Transport in the UK Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP). 41 An aerodrome operator is defined as the person owning or managing an aerodrome: 1982 Act s 38A(11). 119
Transport Noise
(iv) impose other restrictions for limiting the cumulative amount of noise caused 
by aircraft of specified descriptions taking off or landing at the aerodrome 
during specified periods.42
If a noise control scheme imposes requirements in relation to the taking off or 
landing of an aircraft at an aerodrome, the requirements so imposed have effect in 
relation to the aircraft only while the aircraft is within such an area as is specified 
in an order made by the Secretary of State.43 If no such area has been so specified 
the requirements apply only while the aircraft is within an area represented by a 
circle with a radius of forty kilometres from the centre of the longest runway at the 
aerodrome.
Before making an order, the Secretary of State is required to consult certain 
bodies.44 The Secretary of State is required to consult: the CAA, the aerodrome 
operator; representatives of the operators of aircraft using the aerodrome; local 
authorities in whose areas the aerodrome (or any part of it) is situated; other local 
authorities whose areas are in the neighbourhood of the aerodrome, and any other 
body appearing to the Secretary of State to be representative of persons concerned 
with the locality in which the aerodrome is situated. 
Where a noise control scheme imposes requirements in relation to the taking 
off or landing at an aerodrome, the scheme may provide for the aerodrome operator 
to require the payment of a penalty if any such requirement is not complied with.45
The scheme requires to afford the operator of the aircraft the opportunity to make 
representations relating to the penalty to the aerodrome operator, either before 
or after the penalty is imposed.46 If the scheme affords an opportunity to make 
representations after a penalty is imposed, the scheme requires to provide for the 
aerodrome operator to cancel the penalty if it considers it appropriate to do so having 
considered those representations.47
Noise insulation grants– designated aerodromes
While the reduction of noise at source from aircraft is the most desirable form of 
noise control, a substantial benefit can be achieved by insulating premises exposed 
to noise from aircraft. Under s 79 of the 1982 Act, the Secretary of State may, by 
statutory instrument in respect of designated aerodromes, make a scheme requiring 
the person for the time being managing an aerodrome to make a grant towards 
the cost of insulating buildings, or part of relevant buildings, against noise that is 
attributable to the use of the aerodrome. At the time of writing there are no extant 
grant schemes in operation.48

Environmental information and guidance, etc.
Section 84(1) of the Civil Aviation Act 2012 places a duty on the CAA to publish 
information and advice relating to the environmental effects of civil aviation49 in the 
UK and how human health is, or may be, affected by such effects and the measures 
taken, or proposed to be taken, with a view to reducing, controlling or mitigating the 
adverse environmental effects of civil aviation in the UK. Furthermore, under s 84(2)
(3) the CAA may publish guidance and advice (which is required to be kept under 
review) with a view to reducing, controlling or mitigating the adverse environmental 
effects of civil aviation in the UK. 
Under s 70(2) of the Transport Act 2000 the CAA is required to take account 
of any guidance on environmental objectives given to the CAA by the Secretary of 
State. The Secretary of State issued guidance to the CAA under s 70(2) in 2014.50
Military aircraft 
Noise from military aircraft, especially low-flying aircraft, can cause much higher 
levels of noise on the ground than civilian aircraft. The problem of low flying is 
aggravated by the fact that the design of military aircraft is such that they have a 
greater capacity to create noise than civil aircraft. Furthermore, the legal controls 
discussed so far in the book are largely inapplicable to military aircraft. However, the 
Crown can be sued for noise that contravenes art 8 of the ECHR and also in terms 
of common law nuisance.51
The Ministry of Defence also operates a noise amelioration scheme for 
householders affected by noise in the immediate vicinity of military airfields.52
Planning controls
Town and country planning has an important role to play in controlling noise from 
airports. This topic is dealt with later in the book.53
Hovercraft noise
The Hovercraft Act 1968 provides that Orders in Council may be made inter alia, 
to regulate both the noise and vibration from hovercraft.54 Such orders may also 
provide that no civil action may lie, or proceedings under Part III of the EPA may 
be brought in relation to nuisance, if the Order is complied with. At the time of 
writing,55 no such order has been made.
49 ‘Civil aviation’ means civil airports, associated facilities and aircraft using such airports; Civil Aviation 
Act 2012 s 84(7). 50 See Air Navigation Guidance 2017: Guidance to the CAA on its environmental objectives when carrying 
out its air navigation functions, and to the CAA and wider industry on airspace and noise management 
(Department for Transport, 2017). 51 See e.g. Dennis v MoD [2003] Env LR 741; and Jones v MoD [2021] EWHC 2276; King v Advocate 
General for Scotland 2009 CSOH 169. 52 The Ministry of Defence sets out its policy concerning noise from military aircraft in JSP 418: Leaflet 
04-1, ‘Environmental Noise’. 53 See Ch. 10. 54 Hovercraft Act 1968 s 1(1). 55 March 2022.121
Transport Noise
TRAFFIC NOISE
In 1990 the Noise Review Working Party considered road traffic noise as the most 
serious of all transportation noise problems.56 More recently, in 2018 the World 
Health Organisation drew attention to the fact that at least 100 million people in 
the EU were affected by road traffic noise, and in Western Europe alone at least 1.6 
million healthy years of life were lost as a result of road traffic noise.57
Whereas Parliament has made noise from civil aircraft largely immune from civil 
action,58 it has not been similarly indulgent as far as road traffic noise is concerned. 
However, whilst road traffic noise is not immune from civil action, road traffic noise 
is excluded from constituting a statutory nuisance in terms of s 79(1) of the EPA.59
Liability in nuisance
Private nuisance60
As far as civil liability is concerned, vehicle noise that interferes with the enjoyment 
of land could constitute a private nuisance. 
Public nuisance
Furthermore, noise from a vehicle using a public road could constitute a public 
nuisance61 in England and Wales. In the Court of Appeal case of Attorney General v 
PYA Quarries Ltd,
62 which concerned an action that was brought by local residents 
who were adversely affected by the projection of stones, grit and dust from the 
defendants quarry, Lord Denning MR stated that a public nuisance was nuisance 
that was so widespread in its range, and so indiscriminate in its effect, that it would 
not be reasonable to expect one individual to take proceedings on their own to put 
a stop to it, but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at 
large.63 Whether the group of individuals is sufficiently numerous to raise an action 
in public nuisance is a question of fact in every case.64 In such circumstances, an 
individual could seek redress by way of a relator action for an injunction brought by 
the Attorney General. However, if an individual who is affected by a state of affairs 
that constitutes a public nuisance can show that they have suffered personal injury, 
damage or inconvenience (as would be the case with interference by noise) that was 
substantially more serious than that suffered by others who are exposed to the same 
nuisance, the claimant would be able to bring a civil action for public nuisance.65

Furthermore, under s 222 of the Local Government Act 1972 a local authority 
is empowered to bring proceedings in its own name (i.e. without the concurrence of 
the Attorney General) for injunctive relief where it considers it expedient to do so 
for the protection of the interests of the inhabitants. 
Regulation of road traffic noise
There is no legal limit as regards road traffic noise beyond the requirements of the 
Noise Insulation Regulations, which are discussed below.66 However, the approach 
to the problem of road noise in the UK has been to regulate vehicle construction and 
use in order to reduce the capacity of vehicles to generate noise on roads. 
As far as the statutory control of noise from vehicles is concerned, s 41(1) of 
the Road Traffic Act 1988 (the 1988 Act) allows the national authority67 to make 
regulations that govern the use of motor vehicles on roads, their construction and 
equipment and the conditions under which they can be used. Section 41(2) allows 
specific provision to be made in the regulations inter alia with respect to noise. It is 
made an offence to fail to comply with regulations that have been made under s 41 
relating to the construction and use requirement in the regulations, or uses on a road 
a motor vehicle that does not comply with such a requirement, or causes a motor 
vehicle to be so used.68
The main regulations that govern the construction and use of vehicles are the 
Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986.69 Under reg 54 every 
vehicle that is propelled by an internal combustion engine requires to be fitted with 
an exhaust system that includes a silencer, both of which require to be kept good and 
efficient working order. Regulations 55–57 make provision in respect of noise limits 
that vehicles must not exceed. Furthermore, under reg 97 no motor vehicle may be 
used on a road in such a manner as to cause any excessive noise that could have been 
avoided by the exercise of reasonable care on the part of the driver.
Section 54(1) of the 1988 Act gives the Secretary of State power to make 
regulations that prescribe requirements (i.e. ‘type approval requirements’) relating to 
the design, construction and equipment of vehicles. Under s 55(1) if the Secretary 
of State is satisfied that a vehicle of a class in relation to which regulations that have 
been made under s 54 apply, and that the vehicle complies with the relevant type 
approval requirements, the Secretary of State may approve that vehicle as a type 
vehicle. Under s  55(2) where the Secretary of State approves a vehicle as a type 
vehicle they are required to issue a type approval certificate, stating that the vehicle 
complies with the relevant type approval requirements. A plethora of type approval 
regulations have been made, the vast majority of which have no bearing at all on 
noise. However, the Road Vehicles (Approval) Regulations 202070 specify certain 
requirements relating to the reduction of vehicle noise, for example, that a vehicle is 
66 See pp. 124–5 incl. 67 ‘National authority’ means in relation to a function so far as is exercisable within devolved competence, 
within the meaning of the Scotland Act 1998, the Scottish Ministers, otherwise, the Secretary of State: 
Road Traffic Act 1988 s 41(2A). 68 Road Traffic Act 1988 s 42. 69 1988 SI/1078. 70 SI 2020/818.123
Transport Noise
fitted with an exhaust system, including a silencer, and also requirements relating to 
noise testing.71
The above legislation includes the regulation of noise from motorcycles. In 
addition to these controls, the Motor Cycle Noise Act 198772 prohibits a person 
who is carrying on a business to supply, offer or agree to supply, or expose, or have 
in their possession for the purpose of suppling, an exhaust system for a motor cycle 
or a silencer, or any component other than a silencer, or fixing for such a system, 
unless the system, silencer or component complies with the provisions of regulations 
made by the Secretary of State. The Motor Cycle Silencer and Exhaust Systems 
Regulations 199573 makes provision inter alia for the marking of silencers, as well as 
for packaging, labelling and accompanying instructions. 
Location and design of roads
The location and design of new roads has an obvious bearing on the capacity of 
vehicles to discomfort the public by noise. The Department of Transport and 
the Welsh Office issued guidance to highways and roads authorities in 1988 in a 
memorandum entitled, Calculation of Road Traffic Noise74 to allow them to calculate 
road traffic noise. The memorandum describes procedures for calculating such noise 
and also provides guidance appropriate to the calculation of road traffic noise, for the 
purposes of highway design, road schemes, land use planning and for the purpose of 
calculating entitlement under the Noise Insulation Regulations.75
Road traffic regulation
The Road Traffic Regulation Act 198476 allows a traffic authority, for a road outside 
Greater London, to make a traffic regulation order in respect of the road where it 
appears to the authority making the order that it is expedient to make it inter alia
for preserving or improving the amenities of the area through which the road runs.
Powers of police to seize vehicles
In England and Wales if a police constable in uniform has reasonable grounds for 
believing that a motor vehicle77 is being used in any manner that is causing or is likely 
to cause alarm, distress or annoyance to any member of the public, the constable has 
power inter alia to seize the vehicle, under the Police Reform Act 2002 (the 2002 
Act).78 A police constable has similar powers where he has reasonable grounds for 
believing that a motor vehicle has been used in similar circumstances.79 However, a 
vehicle may not be seized unless he has warned the person who appears to the police

will seize it if that use continues, or is repeated, and it appears to him that the use 
has continued or has been repeated after the warning.80 In certain circumstances, the

the vehicle.81
MISCELLANEOUS CONTROLS, ETC. OVER TRANSPORT NOISE
Planning law and noise mapping
Planning law and noise mapping have a role to play as far the control of noise from 
roads and aerodromes is concerned. These topics will be dealt with later in the book.82
Noise – effect on value of property
The value of property may depreciate as a result of the construction or use of public 
works, for example, works associated with the construction of a highway or an 
aerodrome. The Land Compensation Act 1973 (the 1973 Act) makes provision for 
the payment of compensation in such circumstances. Under s 1(1) of the Act if the 
value of an interest in land83 is depreciated by physical factors84 that are caused by 
the use of public works,85 then, if the interest qualifies for compensation under the 
1973 Act, and the person who is entitled to the interest makes a claim under the 
Act, compensation is payable by the responsible authority86 to the person making 
the claim. However, compensation is not payable under the Act, in respect of the 
physical factors caused by the use of any public works, other than a highway, unless 
immunity from actions in nuisance in respect of that noise is conferred (whether 
expressly or by implication) by an enactment relating to these works or, in the case 
of an aerodrome and physical factors caused by aircraft – the aerodrome is one to 
which s 77(2) of the 1982 Act (immunity from actions in nuisance)87 for the time 
being, applies.88
Sound insulation
As has been seen, the vast bulk of the legislation relating to transport noise is aimed 
at suppressing noise at source. However, the impact of noise on those living in 
80 2002 Act s 59(4). 81 2002 Act s 59(5). 82 See Ch. 10. 83 Section 2 of the Land Compensation Act 1973 defines the interests that qualify for compensation 
under s 1. 84 ‘Physical factors’ include noise and vibration: 1973 Act s 1(2). Physical factors caused by an aircraft 
arriving or departing from an aerodrome are treated, for the purposes of the Act, as caused by the use 
of the use of the aerodrome, whether or not the aircraft is within the boundaries of the aerodrome. 
However, the source of the physical factors must be situated on, or in the public works, the use of which 
is alleged to be their cause: s 1(5). 85 ‘Public works’ include a highway and any aerodrome: 1973 Act s 1(3). 86 The responsible authority under s 1(1) is in relation to a highway, the appropriate highway authority 
and, in relation to other public works, the person managing those works: 1973 Act s 1(4). 87 See p. 155 above. 88 1973 Act s 1(6).125
Transport Noise
the vicinity of public works can be mitigated by insulating buildings against the 
transmission of noise. Under s 20 of the 1973 Act the Secretary of State may make 
regulations either imposing a duty, or conferring a power, on responsible authorities 
to insulate buildings against noise, which is either caused or expected to be caused, 
by the construction or use of public works, or to make grants in respect of the cost of 
such insulation.89 The Noise Insulation Regulations 197590 make provision for the 
noise insulation of premises affected by road traffic noise. 
Under reg 3(1) where the use of a highway to which the Regulation relates,91
causes, or is expected to cause noise at a level that is not less than the specified 
level,92 the appropriate highway authority is required either to carry out or make 
a grant in respect of the cost of carrying out, insulating work in or to an eligible 
building as defined in reg 7 (below). The duty that is imposed on the responsible 
authority under reg 3(1) applies to a highway and also to a highway in relation to 
which an additional carriageway either has been, or is about to be constructed, if the 
highway or additional carriageway was, or will be, first open to public traffic after 
16 October 1972.93
Under reg 4 a highway authority has power to carry out, or make such grants, in 
relation to the use of a highway first open to public traffic after 16 October 1969 and 
before 17 October 1972. 
Under reg 7(1) a noise insulation grant is only available, subject to certain 
exceptions, in respect of dwellings and other buildings used for residential purposes 
that will not be more than 300 metres from the nearest point on the carriageway of 
the highway, after the construction of that highway, or of an additional carriageway 
therefor, or the alteration thereof, as the case may be.
Insulation work carried out pursuant to the Regulations requires to be carried out 
in accordance with certain specifications.94
The Department of Transport memorandum Calculation of Road Traffic Noise, 
which has been mentioned above,95 describes the procedures for calculating noise 
from road traffic, which are necessary to enable entitlement under the Noise 
Insulation Regulations to be determined.
Similar legislation to the above, namely, the Land Compensation (Scotland) Act 
1973 and the Noise Insulation (Scotland) Regulations 197596 apply in Scotland.
89 1973 Act s 20(1). 90 SI 1973/1763. 91 Regulation 3 relates to: (a) a highway; and (b) a highway for which an additional carriageway has been 
or is to be constructed, if the highway or additional carriageway was or will be first open to the public 
traffic after 16 October 1972. 92 ‘Specified level’ means a noise level of L 10 (18-hour) of 68  dB(A); SI 1973/1763 reg 2. For the 
purposes of regs 3 and 4 the use of a highway causes, or is expected to cause, noise at a level not less 
than the specified level if: (a) the relevant noise level is greater by at least 1dB(A) than the prevailing 
noise level and is not less than the specified level; and (b) noise caused or expected to be caused by 
traffic using, or expected to use, that highway makes an effective contribution to the relevant noise level 
of at least 1dB(A): SI 1973/1763 reg 3(2). 93 SI 1973/1763 reg 3(3). 94 SI 1973/1763 reg 9, Sch 1. 95 See p. 123. 96 SI 1975/460.NOISE AND NOISE LAW

RAIL TRAFFIC NOISE 
Noise from trains can constitute a significant environmental problem. Such noise 
may emanate from the action of trains travelling on rails, as well as noise from 
shunting operations. The vast majority of railway lines in the UK were constructed 
during the nineteenth century by way of private Acts of Parliament, when railway 
construction had assumed fever pitch. Since the power to construct a railway derived 
from Acts of Parliament, the defence of statutory authority (which is a complete 
defence) would be applicable in relation to an action in nuisance.97 The upshot of 
this is that it would not be possible to take action, by way of private nuisance, or in 
terms of statutory nuisance, in relation to noise from the relevant railway provided 
that the creation of the relevant noise was the inevitable consequence of that which 
was authorised by the relevant Act.98
In England and Wales, s 158(1), (2) of the Planning Act 2008 confers statutory 
authority, in terms of civil or criminal proceedings, for carrying out development 
in relation to which consent is granted by an order granting development consent 
and doing anything else authorised by an order granting such consent. This defence 
is only available in relation to relevant nuisance actions. The defence of statutory 
authority under the Act would apply to noise from railways, which are nationally 
significant infrastructure projects,99 in terms of s  14(1)(k) of the Planning Act 
2008.100
At present the Transport and Works (Scotland) Act 2007101 allows the Scottish 
Ministers to make an order relating to, or to other matters connected with, the 
construction or operation of a transport system, including a railway that starts, ends 
and remains in Scotland. However, there is no authority on whether the defence of 
statutory authority would be applicable in respect of noise from trains that used a 
new railway line that was authorised under an order made under the Act. 
Sound insulation
The Noise Insulation (Railways and Other Guided Transport Systems) Regulations 
1996102 make provision for the sound insulation of premises affected by rail traffic 
noise. The Regulations apply in relation to initial works, additional works or altered 
works that form part of a transport system in relation to a railway, a tramway and a 
system using modes of guided transport falling within the scope of the Regulations, 
97 See p. 4 for a discussion of the defence of statutory. 98 Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd [1981] AC 1001. See p. 41. The High-Speed Rail (London-West 
Midlands) Act 2017 makes provision for defences in relation to proceedings for statutory noise 
nuisance, under the EPA ss 79 and 80 (see above) and ss 60 and 61 of the Control of Pollution Act 
1974 relating to the control of noise and prior consent for work on construction sites. 99 Development consent is required for nationally significant infrastructure projects: Planning Act 2008 
s 31. 100 A railway falls within the scope of Planning Act 2008 s 14(1)(k) provided that the railway will be, 
when constructed, wholly in England and the railway will (when constructed) be part of a network 
operated by an approved operator. The railway also requires to be of more than two kilometres in 
length: Planning Act 2008 s 25(1). 101 Transport and Works (Scotland) Act 2007 s 1. 102 SI 1996/428.127

such works being provided or used in the exercise of statutory powers.103 However, 
ground-born vibration falls outwith the scope of the Regulations.104
The responsible authority is required to either to carry out, or make a grant, in 
respect of the cost of carrying out insulation work, either in or to an eligible building 
(as defined in reg 7 below) when on, or after, the relevant date105 the movement of 
vehicles using, or expected to use, initial works or additional works, as the case may 
be, causes or is expected to cause noise at a level not less than the prescribed level.106
The responsible authority has the power either to carry out or make a grant in 
respect of the cost of carrying out, insulation work in or to any eligible building, either 
when on, or after, the relevant date, the movement of vehicles using, or expected to 
use, altered works causes or is expected to cause noise at a level that is not less than 
the prescribed level.107
Under reg 7(1) the duty on the part of the responsible authority to carry out 
insulating work, or make a grant in terms of the Regulations, is confined (subject 
to certain exceptions) to ‘eligible buildings’, that is to say, to dwellings and other 
buildings that are used for residential purposes that will be not more than 300 metres 
from the nearest point of the nearest running rail, or if the relevant system has no 
running rail, the nearest point of the nearest apparatus corresponding thereto, of the 
initial, additional, or altered works, as the case may be. 
Regulation 8 gives the responsible authority power to either carry out, or make 
a grant in respect of the cost of carrying out insulating work, in or to, an eligible 
building, in circumstances where the construction of initial works or additional 
works or the carrying out of altered works, either causes or is expected to cause noise 
at a level that in the opinion of the responsible authority either seriously affects or 
will seriously affect for a substantial period of time, the enjoyment of an eligible 
building adjacent to the site on which the works are being or are to be carried out.

Chapter 9
Noise Mapping
INTRODUCTION
Noise mapping in the UK owes its existence, as does much of UK environmental 
law, to the EU. Directive 2002/49/EC (the END Directive) was the most important 
measure the EU had taken in relation to ambient noise. Environmental noise mainly 
consists of noise from transport sources such as road, rail and aviation. The END 
addresses this problem. The END represents the flagship of the EU in its attempt 
to address environmental noise. The END’s main objective is to establish a common 
approach intended to avoid, prevent or reduce, on a prioritised basis, the harmful 
effects, including annoyance, caused by exposure to environmental noise.1
 That policy 
is to be implemented inter alia by the determination of exposure to environmental 
noise, through noise mapping by methods of assessment that are common to the 
Member States, and by ensuring that information on environmental noise, and its 
effects, is made available to the public. The scope of the END is wide-ranging and 
applies to environmental noise that humans are exposed to, particularly in built-up 
areas, in public parks or other quiet areas in an agglomeration,2
 in quiet areas in the 
open country,3
 near schools, hospitals and other noise-sensitive buildings and areas.4
However, the END does not apply to noise caused by the exposed person themselves, 
noise from domestic activities, noise created by neighbours, noise at work places or 
noise inside means of transport or due to military activities in military areas. 
COMPETENT AUTHORITIES
Under the END Directive Member States are required to designate the appropriate 
levels of competent authorities and bodies responsible for implementing the END.5
1 Council Directive 2002/49/EC art 1. ‘Environmental noise’ is defined as unwanted or harmful outdoor 
sound created by human activities, including noise emitted by means of transport, road traffic, air traffic 
and from sites of industrial activity such as those defined in Annex I to Council Directive 96/61/EC 
concerning integrated pollution and control: art 3.
2 ‘Agglomeration’ means part of a territory, delineated by a Member State, having a population in 
excess of 100,000 persons and a population density such that Member States consider it to be in an 
urbanised area. A quiet area in an agglomeration means an area delimited by the competent authority, 
for instance, which is not by the Council Directive 2002/49/EC art 3. 3 ‘A quiet area in the open country’ means an area delimited by the competent authority, that is undisturbed 
by noise from traffic, industry or recreational activities: Council Directive 2002/49/EC art 3. 4 Council Directive 2002/49/EC art 2.
5 Council Directive 2002/49/EC art 4.

This includes authorities responsible for making and, where relevant, approving noise 
maps6
 and action plans for agglomerations, major roads,7
 major railways,8
 major 
airports9
 and also, collecting noise maps and action plans.10
NOISE INDICATORS
Member States are required to use noise indicators L den(lower case) and L night 
(lower case) as referred to in Annex I for the preparation and revision of strategic 
noise mapping in accordance with art 7 (below).11
ASSESSMENT METHODS
The values of L den (lower case) and L night (lower case) require to be determined 
by means of assessment methods that are defined in Annex II.12
STRATEGIC NOISE MAPPING
Member States were required to ensure that, no later than 30 June 2007, strategic 
noise maps showing the situation in the preceding calendar year had been made 
out and, where relevant, approved by the relevant competent authorities for all 
agglomerations with more than 250,000 inhabitants and for all major roads that 
have more than six million vehicle passages a year and major airports within their 
territories.13 Member States are required to adopt measures to ensure that no later 
than 30 June 2012, and thereafter every five years, strategic noise maps showing the 
situation in the previous calendar year have been made and, where relevant, approved 
by the competent authorities for all agglomerations and for all major roads and 
major railways within their territories. Strategic noise maps are required to satisfy the 
minimum requirements laid down in Annex IV. Strategic noise maps are required to 
be reviewed, and revised, if necessary, at least every five years after the date of their 
preparation.
6 ‘Noise mapping’ means the presentation of data on an existing or predicted noise situation in terms of 
a noise indicator, indicating breaches of any relevant limit value in force, the number of people affected 
in certain area or the number of dwellings exposed to certain values of a noise indicator in a certain 
area: Council Directive 2002/49/EC art 3. 7 ‘Major road’ means a regional, national, or international road, designated by the Member State, which 
has more than three million vehicle passages per year: Council Directive 2002/49/EC art 3.
8 ‘Major railway’ means a railway, designated by the Member State, which has more than 30,000 train 
passages per year: Council Directive 2002/49/EC art 3.
9 ‘Major airport’ means a civil airport designated by the Member State that has more than 30,000 train 
passages per year: Council Directive 2002/49/EC art 3. 10 ‘Action plans’ means plans designed to manage noise issues and effects, including noise reduction if 
necessary: Council Directive 2002/49/EC art 3. 11 Council Directive 2002/49/EC art 5. 12 Council Directive 2002/49/EC art 6. 13 Council Directive 2002/49/EC art 7.131
Noise Mapping
ACTION PLANS
Member States were required to ensure that, no later than 18 July 2008, the competent 
authorities had drawn up action plans designed to manage, within their territories, 
noise issues and effects, including noise reduction, if necessary for:
(a) places near the major roads that had more than six million vehicle passages 
a year, major railways that had more than 60,000 train passages a year, and 
major airports;
(b) agglomerations with more than 250,000 inhabitants. Such plans were also 
required to aim to protect quiet areas against an increase in noise.14
Measures within the plans were at the discretion of the competent authorities. 
However, the plans were required to address priorities that could be identified by 
the exceeding of any limit value, or by other criteria that was chosen by the Member 
States, and apply, in particular, to the most important areas, as established by strategic 
noise mapping. Member States were required to ensure that, no later than 18 July 
2013, the competent authorities had drawn up action plans, notably to address 
priorities that could be identified by the exceeding of any relevant limit value, or by 
other criteria chosen by the Member States for the agglomerations, and for the major 
roads, as well as the major railways within their territories. 
The action plans are required to be reviewed, and revised if necessary, when a 
major development occurs affecting the existing noise situation and at least every 
five years after the date of approval of those plans. Member States are required to 
ensure that the public is consulted about proposals for action plans and that the 
results of the participation are considered. The public is required to be informed of 
any decisions taken. 
INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC
Member States are required to ensure that the strategic noise maps that they 
have made and have adopted, and the action plans that they have drawn up, are 
available and disseminated to the public in accordance with relevant EU legislative 
Acts.15 Such information can be made available by means of available information 
technologies. The information requires to be clear, comprehensible and easily 
accessible. A summary setting out the most important points requires to be provided.
The END has been implemented in the UK and Northern Ireland by subordinate 
legislation. As far as England is concerned, the END is implemented by the 
Environmental Noise (England) Regulations 2006.16 The Secretary of State has 
general responsibility in relation to measures relating to the assessment, management 
and control of environmental noise.17

General requirements for strategic noise maps
Strategic noise maps are required to satisfy the requirements contained in Schedule 1 
to the Regulations.27 A competent authority is required to apply the noise indicators 
L den (lower case) and L night (lower case)28 as referred to in Annex 1 of the 
END Directive and the supplementary noise indicators29 when making or revising 
strategic noise maps.30
Strategic noise maps –noise sources other than non-designated airports
The Secretary of State is made the competent authority for the making, review 
and revision of strategic noise maps, for noise sources other than non-designated 
airports.31 The Secretary of State was required to make and adopt strategic noise 
maps showing the situation in the preceding calendar year for all:
(a) first round agglomerations;
(b) first round major roads;
(c) first round major railways; and
(d) major airports.32
No later than 30 June 2012, and thereafter, every five years, the Secretary of State 
is required to make, and adopt, strategic noise maps showing the situation in the 
previous calendar year, for all:
(a) agglomerations;
(b) major roads;
(c) major railways; and
(d) major airports.33
The Secretary of State is required to review and, if necessary, revise any strategic noise 
map that they have made or have adopted whenever a major development occurs that 
affects the existing noise situation.34

Strategic noise maps – non-designated major airports
As far as non-designated major airports are concerned the airport operator was 
required, no later than 31 March 2007, and every 5 years thereafter, to make a strategic 
noise map showing the situation in the preceding calendar year for the airport and 
submit that map with input data and metadata36 to the Secretary of State.37
From time to time, and whenever a major development occurs affecting the 
existing noise situation, the airport operator is required to review and, if necessary, 
revise any strategic noise map that has been made and adopted under reg 23 (below).38
The airport authority must submit any strategic noise map that has been so revised,

of its revision.39
Strategic noise maps – non-designated other airports
As far as non-designated airports, other than major airports, are concerned, the 
airport operator was required, no later than 31 March 2007, to make a strategic noise 
map showing the situation in the preceding calendar year for any relevant first round 
agglomeration40 and submit that map, along with input data and metadata, to the 
Secretary of State.41 No later than 31 March 2012, and thereafter every five years, 
the airport operator is required to make a strategic noise map showing the situation 
in the preceding calendar year for any relevant agglomeration42 and submit that 
map, along with input data and metadata, to the Secretary of State.43
From time to time, and whenever a major development occurs that affects the 
existing noise situation, the airport operator is required to review and, if necessary, 
revise any strategic noise map that has been made and has been adopted under reg 
23 (below).44 The airport authority is required to submit any strategic noise map so 
revised, along with input data and metadata, to the Secretary of State within three 
working days of its revision.45
The most recent noise maps that have been produced by DEFRA, on behalf of 
the Secretary of State, were published in 2017.46

Noise Mapping
Quiet areas 
The Secretary of State is required to identify quiet areas in first round agglomerations 
and also quiet areas in agglomerations in such published form as the Secretary of State 
considers appropriate.47 The Secretary of State is required to keep the identification 
of quiet areas in first round agglomerations, and agglomerations, under review and 
make revisions where the Secretary of State considers it appropriate.48
ACTION PLANS 
By way of introduction, action plans are based on the results of noise mapping, which 
occurs on a five-year cycle. Round 1 noise mapping took place in 2007. Subsequent 
action plans were adopted in 2010. Round 2 noise mapping took place in 2012, and 
the subsequent action plans were adopted in January 2014. The most recent mapping 
(i.e. Round 3) took place in 2017. In July 2019 DEFRA published three noise action 
plans in response to that noise mapping.49
We now discuss the relevant law.
The Secretary of State may compile a consolidated noise map in respect of any 
area covered by more than one strategic noise map.50
The Secretary of State is required to set out limit values, or other criteria, for the 
identification of priorities for action plans in such published form as the Secretary of 
State considers appropriate.51 The Secretary of State is required to keep the relevant 
criteria under review and, where the Secretary of State considers it appropriate, make 
revisions. 
Action plans – general requirements
Any action plan that has either been drawn up, or revised, is required inter alia to:
(i) aim to prevent and reduce environmental noise where necessary, and 
particularly where exposure levels can induce harmful effects on human 
health;
(ii) aim to preserve environmental noise quality where it is good;
(iii) be designed to manage noise issues and effects, including noise reduction, if 
necessary;
(iv) aim to protect quiet areas in first round agglomerations and agglomerations 
against an increase in noise; and
(v) address priorities that must be identified having regard to the relevant 
criteria.52

An action plan, and any revision of an action plan, must be based upon and apply, in 
particular, to the most important areas established by all strategic noise maps that are 
made or revised pursuant to regs 7, 11 or 12 (and adopted pursuant to reg 2353) and 
concern any part of the area addressed by the action plan.54 The action plan must also 
be based upon and apply, in particular, to the most important areas as established by 
a consolidated noise map to the extent that it concerns any part of an area addressed 
by the action plan.
Action plans – noise sources other than airports 
The Secretary of State is the competent authority for drawing up, reviewing and the 
revision of action plans in England.55
The Secretary of State was required, no later than 18 July 2008, to draw up action 
plans for:
(a) places near first round major roads;
(b) places near first round major railways; and
(c) first round agglomerations.56
The Secretary of State was required, no later than 18 July 2013, to draw up action 
plans for:
(a) places near major roads;
(b) Places near major railways; and
(c) agglomerations.57
The Secretary of State is required to review and, if necessary, revise the action plan 
whenever a major development occurs that affects the existing noise situation.58 The 
action plan also requires to be reviewed and, if necessary, revised at least every five 
years after the date on which an action plan is adopted under reg 24 (below).
Action plans – airports
The airport operator is made the competent authority in relation to:
(a) major airports; and
(b) non-designated other airports, if aircraft noise results in an L den (lower case) 
value of 55dB(A) or greater, or an L night (lower case) value of 55 dB(A) or 
greater anywhere in first round agglomerations, or agglomerations.59
The airport operator was required to draw up an action plan for places near the 
airport and submit that action plan to the Secretary of State, no later than 30 June 
2008.60 The airport operator was required, no later than 30 June 2013, to draw up an

of State.61
The airport operator is required to review and, if necessary, revise the action plan 
whenever a major development occurs that affects the existing noise situation.62
The action plan must also be reviewed, and if necessary revised, at least every five 
years after the date on which it was adopted under reg 24. An action plan must be 
submitted to the Secretary of State within three working days of its revision.63
Public participation 
In preparing and also revising action plans for noise sources other than airports, and 
also airports, the competent authority is required to ensure that:
(a) the public is consulted about proposals for action plans;
(b) the public is given early and effective opportunities to participate in the 
preparation and review of the action plans;
(c) the results of that public participation are taken into account;
(d) the public is informed of any decisions taken; and
(e) reasonable time frames are provided, allowing sufficient time for each stage 
of public participation.64
ADOPTION OF STRATEGIC NOISE MAPS AND ACTION PLANS
The Secretary of State is required to adopt a strategic noise map that has been 
submitted to them under reg 11 (non-designated major airports) or reg 12 (non￾designated other airports) if the map meets the requirements of reg 4 (general 
requirements).65 The Secretary of State is under a similar duty in relation to a revised 
strategic noise map, or in relation to a map that either has been made or has been 
revised by them. However, if the Secretary of State considers that a noise map that 
has been submitted to them under regs 11 or 12 does not meet the requirements of 
reg 4, the Secretary of State may either amend and adopt the map, or they may reject 
the map.66 If the Secretary of State rejects a strategic noise map, he is required to 
notify the competent authority that submitted it of the reasons why the map was not 
adopted, and also of the date by which the map must be revised and resubmitted.67
The competent authority is then required to submit the revised strategic noise map to 
the Secretary of State by the date specified in the notification.68 The aforementioned 
requirements also apply in respect of a revised strategic noise map.69 If the Secretary

to take such steps as they consider appropriate for ensuring that the map complies 
with the requirements of reg 4.70
Adoption of action plans
If the Secretary of State considers that an action plan that has been submitted to 
him under reg 19 (airports), or an action plan that has been drawn up or revised by 
them, meets the requirements of reg 15 (general requirements) the Secretary of State 
may adopt the action plan.71 The Secretary of State has a similar power in relation 
to a revised action plan that has been submitted to him. However, if the Secretary 
of State considers that an action plan submitted to him in terms of reg 19 does not 
meet the requirements of reg 15, or that an action plan has not been adopted by him, 
the Secretary of State is required to either amend and adopt the plan, or reject that 
plan.72 If the Secretary of State rejects an action plan they are required to notify the 
competent authority that submitted the plan of the reasons why the plan was not 
adopted, and also of the date by which the plan must be revised and resubmitted.73
The competent authority is required to submit the revised action plan by the date 
specified in the notification.74 The aforementioned requirements apply to a revised 
action plan as they do in relation to an action plan.75 If the Secretary of State either 
amends an action plan, or a revised action plan, they are required to take such steps 
as they consider appropriate for ensuring that the action plan, or the revised action 
plan, complies with the requirements of the Regulations.76
POWERS OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE
The Secretary of State may at any time require the competent authority to provide 
information in relation to its functions under the Regulations.77
Information to the public and guidance
Any strategic noise map or any action plan that is made available to the public before 
it is adopted is required to include prominently displayed wording to the effect that 
it is a draft that is subject to adoption by the Secretary of State.78 Any strategic map 
that has been adopted, or any consolidated noise map that has been compiled by 
the Secretary of State, or any action plan that has been adopted by the Secretary of 
State, is required to be published by the Secretary of State and also accompanied by

Chapter 10
Planning and Noise
The law relating to town and country planning has an important role to play in the 
control of noise in the environment. In this chapter we first consider environmental 
impact assessment, then strategic environmental assessment and thereafter, turn our 
attention to the control of development, under the Town and Country Planning 
Acts.
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT 
Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a key legal mechanism that has emerged 
in the last thirty-five years. It has its origins in the USA in the 1960s.1
 There it was 
a response to both the growing environmental movement of that era2
 and also, in no 
small measure, to the concerns about the US interstate highway system during the 
1960s.3
 EIA enables decision-makers, mainly in the form of planning authorities 
as far as the UK is concerned, to take account of the environmental impact of their 
decisions. In essence, the importance of EIA is that information, about the likely 
environmental impacts of certain development projects, is properly considered 
before a decision is taken as to whether they should proceed. EIA is a process, or 
procedure, that comprises a drawing-together in both a formal and systematic way 
of assessments of projects that are likely to have significant environmental effects. 
This process helps to ensure that the importance of the predicted effects, and the 
scope for reducing them, are properly understood not only by the public, but by the 
relevant competent authority before it makes its decision.4
 The use of EIA conduces 
to transparency on the part of actions that are taken by decision-makers, and also 
increases the opportunities for the public to participate in the planning process. Since 
its adoption in the US National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, EIA has become 
an important tool of domestic environmental management world-wide.5
EIA DIRECTIVE AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN THE UK
The European Commission’s Second Action Programme on the environment, in 
1977, reiterated the approach that had been expressed in the First Action Programme, 
1 See the US National Environmental Policy Act 1969.
2 See R. Carson, Silent Spring (1962). 3 S. Tromans, Environmental Impact Assessment, 2nd edn (Bloomsbury, 2012) at 2. 4 Department of Environment (now DEFRA) Circ. 02/1999, Environmental Impact Assessment para 9. 5 Birnie, Boyle and Redgwell, International Law and the Environment, 4th edn (OUP, 2021) at 184.

namely that effects on the environment should be taken into account at the earliest 
possible stage in all the technical planning and decision-making processes.6
 The 
UK was initially opposed to the European Commission’s proposals for a Directive 
on EIA.7
 Such opposition was largely based on the definition of the projects that 
would fall within the scope of an EIA Directive and also the delays and litigation that 
the implementation of the Directive would have on the planning process. The 1985 
Directive, namely Directive 85/337/EEC, represented a political compromise.8
The 1985 Directive has been subsequently amended several times. It was codified in 
2011 by Directive 2011/92/EU (the ‘Directive’) which, in turn, has been amended 
by Directive 2014/92/EU. The Preamble to the 2011 Directive provides that 
development consent for public and private projects that are likely to have significant 
effects on the environment should be granted only after an assessment of the likely 
significant effects of those projects have been carried out.
Article 2 requires Member States to adopt all measures that are necessary to 
ensure that before consent is given, projects that are likely to have significant effects 
on the environment by virtue, inter alia, of their nature, size or location, are made 
subject to a requirement for development consent and an assessment with regard to 
their effects. Importantly, the article provides that EIA may be integrated into the 
existing procedures for consent to projects in Member States. 
What is a project?
The Directive defines a project as the execution of construction works or other 
interventions in the natural surroundings and landscape, including those involving 
the extraction of mineral resources.9
 Normally, to be classed as a project there requires 
to be some form of construction or physical intervention. In Brussels in the case of 
Hoofdsedilyk Gewest v Vlaams Gewest10 the European Court of Justice held that a 
consent, which simply allowed an airport to continue to operate, was not a project 
that fell within the scope of the Directive on the basis that no works or physical 
interventions to the airport were involved nor did the relevant consent constitute a 
stage in a procedure that could lead either to such works or physical interventions. 
However, where a proposal is simply part of a larger scheme that, when looked at 
in toto, would constitute a project that falls within the scope of the Directive, an 
EIA would be required. What is at issue here is what has been referred to as ‘salami 
slicing’, namely splitting a large development project into smaller units that, looked 
at in isolation, would fall below the thresholds that would require an EIA.11 The 
Directive is not simply confined to new projects but also includes the modification 
of existing projects.12

Planning and Noise
While the UK courts have never fully addressed the point, in the Court of Appeal 
case of Bowen-West v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government13 Laws 
LJ suggested that whether or not a proposal was part of a larger scheme could be 
either a question of law or one of judgement for the decision-maker.14 Again, in R
(Save Britain’s Heritage) v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government15
Stadlen J stated that the question whether a development was an intrinsic part of 
any inevitably wider whole was a matter of fact and judgement for the decision￾maker.
‘Development consent’ is defined in the Directive as ‘the decision of the competent 
authority or authorities, which entitles the developer to proceed with the project’.16
However, the Directive does not cover decisions that involve merely the detailed 
regulation of activities, consent for which has already been given.17 Generally, a 
project that falls within the scope of the Directive would fall within the definition 
of ‘development’ in terms of both s 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 
(TCPA 1990) and also s 26 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 
(TCPSA 1997) and, therefore, be subject to planning control. In such cases, the EIA 
process would be governed by the regulations which we now discuss.
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT 
ASSESSMENT) REGULATIONS 201718
The Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) 
Regulations 2017 (the ‘Regulations’)19 essentially implement art 2 of the Directive, 
as amended. It should be observed, at the outset that, in contrast to the Directive, the 
Regulations do not employ the expression ‘project’ in terms of environmental impact 
assessment. In contrast, the Regulations use the term, ‘development’ in terms of what 
falls to be regulated by the planning regime. 
It should be stressed, however, that the Regulations only relate to development that 
requires consent in terms of town and country planning legislation. The Regulations 
do not apply to development that requires consent under other legislation. Such 
development is subject to separate environmental impact assessment legislation.
Prohibition on grant of planning permission or subsequent consent without an

development unless an EIA has been carried out in respect of that development.20
An EIA development is defined as either a Schedule 1 development or a Schedule 2 
development that is likely to have significant effects on the environment, by virtue of 
such factors as its nature, size and location.21
Schedule 1 development
Schedule 1 of the Regulations implements Annex I of the Directive. Schedule 1 
includes twenty-three different categories of development, including crude oil 
refineries, nuclear power stations, iron and steel works, construction of lines for long 
distance railway traffic, airports, with a basic runway length of 2,100 metres or more, 
motorways and express roads. Almost exclusively, each category in Schedule 1 has its 
own threshold by means of which one determines whether the development ranks 
as a Schedule 1 development. Whereas some thresholds are based on the size of the 
relevant development, other thresholds are ‘triggered’ by the output of the relevant 
development. Furthermore, any change to or extension to a Schedule 1 development 
ranks as such a development, provided that such a change or extension, in itself, 
meets the relevant threshold, if any, of the development set out in the Schedule.22
Schedule 2 
Generally speaking, a Schedule 2 development is one that is likely to have a lesser 
environmental impact than a Schedule 1 development. Examples of a Schedule 2 
development include intensive fish farming, quarries and open cast mining, deep 
drilling, windfarms, brewing and malting, industrial estate development projects, 
construction of airfields (unless included in Schedule 1) and the construction of 
roads (unless included in Schedule 1).
Environmental assessment process
EIA is defined as a process consisting of:
(a) the preparation of an environmental statement;
(b) any consultation, publication and notification required by, or by virtue of (the 
Regulations) or any other enactment in respect on an EIA development; and
(c) the steps required under reg 26.23
EIA is required to identify, describe and assess, in an appropriate manner, in the light 
of each individual case, the direct and indirect significant effects of the proposed 
development on inter alia population and human health.24 The relevant planning 
authority, or the Secretary of State, must ensure that they either have, or have access 
as necessary to, sufficient expertise to examine the environmental statement.25

Planning and Noise
Screening
Where a planning authority, or the Secretary of State, is required to determine 
whether a Schedule 2 development is an EIA development, the relevant planning 
authority is required to consider, inter alia, any information that has been provided 
by the applicant, and also any of the selection criteria that is set out in Schedule 3 as 
are relevant to the development.26 Schedule 3 lists a number of criteria including:
(i) the characteristics of the development;
(ii) the location of the development; and
(iii) the types and characteristics of the potential impact of development.
Of particular relevance to noise, under ‘(i)’ are included pollution and nuisances, and 
also the risks to human health.
Where a planning authority adopts a screening opinion under reg 6(6), or the 
Secretary of State makes a screening direction under reg 7(5), the planning authority, 
or the Secretary of State, are required to state the main reasons for their conclusion 
with reference to the relevant criteria listed in Schedule 3.27 If it is determined that 
the proposed development is not an EIA development, the planning authority or the 
Secretary of State is required to state any features of the proposed development and 
measures envisaged to avoid or prevent what would otherwise have been significant 
adverse effects on the environment. The Secretary of State may make a screening 
direction either on their own volition, or if requested to do so in writing by any 
person.28
A person who is minded to carry out a development may request the relevant 
planning authority to adopt a screening opinion.29 The request must be accompanied, 
inter alia, by a plan sufficient to identify the land, a description of the development 
and a description of the aspects of the environment likely to be significantly 
affected by the development.30 The person providing the information is required 
to take into account, inter alia, the criteria set out in Schedule 3.31 The relevant 
planning authority is required to adopt a screening opinion within three weeks, 
beginning with the date of receipt for a request for such an opinion, or such longer 
period, not exceeding ninety days from the date on which the person making the 
request submits the relevant information, as may be agreed in writing with the 
person making the request.32 If a planning authority adopts a screening opinion, 
the planning authority is required to send a copy to the person who made the 
request.33
Where a relevant planning authority either fails to adopt a screening opinion 
within the relevant period or adopts an opinion to the effect that the development

Secretary of State to make a screening direction.34
The screening process takes place at a relatively early stage of the planning 
process, the upshot of which is that there may be some uncertainty about the full 
possible potential environmental impact of the proposed development. However, 
the screening opinion is required to be based on sufficient information to allow the 
planning authority to make an informed decision as to whether the development is 
likely to have a significant effect on the environment.35 Whether there is sufficient 
information depends on the particular circumstances. A planning authority can 
adopt a screening opinion, notwithstanding the fact that its decision is based on 
less than complete information. In the Court of Appeal case on R (Bateman) v 
Cambridgeshire DC36 Bick-Moore LJ stated that a screening opinion did not involve 
a detailed assessment of the factors relevant to the grant of planning permission. 
That came later. The judge added that a screening opinion involved a decision that 
was almost inevitably based on incomplete information. Again, in R (Thakeham 
Village Action Ltd.) v Horsham DC37 Lindblom J (as he then was) stated that a 
planning authority was not bound to require an EIA, notwithstanding that there 
was some uncertainty about the likely effects of the development. The fact that a 
screening decision involves a matter of judgement or opinion was re-emphasised 
by the Court of Appeal in R v Jones v Mansfield DC38 where Dyson LJ stated 
that whether a proposed development was likely to have significant effects on the 
environment involved an exercise of judgement or opinion. It was not a question 
of hard fact to which there could be only one possible correct answer in any given 
case. The role of the court should be limited to one of review, on Wednesbury
grounds. 
The point that a screening judgement takes part at an initial stage of the 
environmental assessment process and need not involve a rigorous assessment by the 
planning authority was succinctly expressed by Beatson J in Zeb v Birmingham City 
Council39 who stated that detailed reports were not required. What was required was 
an initial assessment of an intended proposal.
In R (Birchall Gardens LLP) v Hertfordshire CC40 Holgate J reiterated the point 
that had been made in Bateman, to the effect that a screening assessment did not 
involve a detailed assessment of factors relevant to the grant of planning permission. 
Nor did it include a full assessment of any identifiable environmental effects. 
It included only a decision, almost inevitably on the basis of less than complete 
information, as to whether an EIA needed to be taken at all. The court should not 
impose too high a burden on planning authorities in relation to the screening process.

Planning and Noise
The judge went on to add41 that whether there was sufficient information before the 
planning authority for it to issue a screening opinion, and whether a development 
was likely to have significant environmental effects, were both matters of judgement 
for the planning authority. Such decisions could be challenged only on the grounds 
of irrationality or for other public law error.
As far as the content of the screening opinion is concerned, in the Court of 
Appeal case of R (Bateman) v South Cambridgeshire CC42 stated that when it was 
adopting a screening opinion, the planning authority was required to provide 
sufficient information to enable anyone interested in the decision to see that 
proper consideration had been given to the possible environmental effects of the 
development and to understand the reasons for that decision. Such information 
could be contained in the screening opinion itself or in separate reasons, if necessary 
combined with additional material provided on request.
Whereas a planning authority is not required to set out at length in its screening 
opinion, the considerations that it has taken into account in adopting a screening 
opinion, the essence of its reasoning, must be plain.43 In the Court of Appeal case of 
R (Friends of Basildon Golf Course) v Basildon DC44 Pill LJ stated that the decision 
taken on a screening opinion was required to be carefully and conscientiously 
considered, and was also required to be based on information that was both sufficient 
and accurate. The opinion was not required to be elaborate but at the same time, 
was required to demonstrate that the issues had been understood and considered. 
Finally, in Birchall Gardens45 Holgate J held that the level of detail that was required 
in a screening opinion depended on the complexity, or otherwise, of the issues that 
fell to be considered. The judge went on to emphasise that in issuing a screening 
opinion the planning authority was not issuing a decision letter in a planning appeal. 
Rather, in issuing a screening opinion, the planning authority was issuing a screening 
opinion for a narrower purpose. 
ENVIRONMENTAL STATEMENTS
An environmental statement (ES) is simply a statement by means of which one 
can assess the environmental effects of a project. The ES has been described as the 
cornerstone of the EIA regime.46 Tromans argues that the importance of the ES lies 
not simply in the information it contains, but in its presentation of that information 
in comprehensive and accessible form to members of the public, including a non￾technical summary.47 The ES is the most visible part of the EIA process and is 
the main source of environmental information that is available to a planning 
authority.

Scoping opinion
A person who is making an EIA application can request the relevant planning 
authority to state, in writing, its opinion (i.e. ‘scoping opinion’) as to the scope and 
level of detail of the information that requires to be provided in the ES.48 A request 
for a scoping opinion is required to include, inter alia, a plan that is sufficient to 
identify the land, a brief description of the nature and purpose of the development, 
its location and an explanation of the likely significant effects of the development 
on the environment.49 A planning authority must not adopt a scoping opinion in 
response to a request until it has consulted the consultation bodies.50 However, the 
planning authority is required to adopt a scoping opinion within five weeks (or such 
longer period as may be agreed in writing with the person making the request), 
beginning on the date of the receipt of the request. A copy must be sent to the person 
who made the request. Before adopting an environmental statement, a planning 
authority is required to take into account, inter alia, any information provided 
by the applicant about the proposed development, the specific characteristics of 
the particular development and the environmental features that are likely to be 
significantly affected by the development.51
Where a planning authority fails to adopt a scoping opinion within the relevant 
period the person who requested the opinion may request the Secretary of State to 
make a scoping direction as to the information to be provided in the environmental 
statement.52
Environmental statement – content, publicity, etc.
An EIA application (i.e. an application for planning permission for an EIA 
development) is required to be accompanied by an environmental statement.53
Whilst the Regulations do not prescribe the precise form that the ES should take, 
the ES is required to contain certain information, as follows:
(a) a description of the proposed development, comprising information on the 
site, design, design, size and other relevant features of the development;
(b) a description of any likely significant effects of the proposed development on 
the environment;
(c) a description of any features of the proposed development, or measures 
envisaged, in order to avoid, prevent or reduce and, if possible, offset 
significant adverse effects on the environment;
(d) a description of the reasonable alternatives studied by the developer, which 
are relevant to the proposed development and its specific characteristics, and 
an indication of the main reasons for the option chosen, taking into account 
the effects of the development on the environment;

Planning and Noise
(e) a non-technical summary of the information referred to in subparagraphs (a) 
to (d); and
(f ) any additional information specified in Schedule 4, relevant to the specific 
characteristics of the particular development, or type of development, and to 
the environmental features likely to be significantly affected.54
An ES must also be based on the most recent scoping opinion or direction that has 
been issued under regs 15 or 16 so far as the proposed development remains the 
same as that which was subject to that opinion or direction.55 The ES is also required 
to include the information that is reasonably required for reaching a reasoned 
conclusion on the significant effects of the development on the environment, 
taking into account current knowledge and methods of assessment. The ES is also 
required to contain the results of any relevant UK environmental assessment that 
are reasonably available to the person preparing the environmental statement, with a 
view to avoiding duplication of assessment. Finally, the ES is required to be prepared 
by competent experts.
In the House of Lords case of Berkeley v Secretary of State for the Environment56
Lord Hoffman stated that an environmental statement must comprise a single 
and accessible compilation (as opposed to a number of separate documents) that is 
produced by the applicant at the very start of the application process. However, the ES 
need not contain detailed and exhaustive information of the potential environmental 
impact of a development. Moreover, the courts are prepared to allow any inadequacies 
and omissions (including apposite remedial, or mitigation measures, which may be 
required to be adopted in the future) in the ES to be addressed by the planning 
authority in the publicity and consultation process, which is incorporated in the EIA 
Regulations as a whole. In R (Blewett) v Derbyshire CC57 Dove J emphasised that EIA 
applications were made on the basis of ‘full information’. However, the Regulations 
were not based on the premise that the ES would contain the full information. The 
process was designed to identify any deficiencies in the ES in order that the local 
planning authority had the full picture, so far as it could be ascertained, when it came 
to consider the environmental information, of which the environmental statement 
would be but a part.
The courts accord planning authorities wide discretion as to the content of an ES. 
In Kent v First Secretary of State58 the claimant was an objector to a proposed waste 
development. The First Secretary had called in the relevant planning application and 
had granted planning permission for the development. The application had been 
accompanied by an ES, which indicated which types of waste, would and would not 
be accepted at the site and also contained a qualitative risk assessment. The claimant 
claimed, inter alia, that the waste, which was to be disposed of at the site, was not 
described with sufficient particularity in the relevant ES. It was further claimed 
that the ES was defective in that it had not included a quantitative risk assessment. 
However, it was held that, whilst an environmental statement was required to

contain sufficient information to allow a planning authority to make an informed 
judgement as to whether the development was likely to have a significant effect on 
the environment, it was for the decision-maker to decide whether the information 
contained in the document was sufficient to meet the definition of an ES, in terms of 
the Regulations, subject to review on Wednesbury grounds.59
Publicity, etc. re the environmental statement
It is of fundamental importance that the public is notified of any ES in respect of 
an EIA application to a planning authority. Where the ES accompanies a planning 
application, the normal procedures relating to publicity for planning applications 
would apply. However, the Regulations make provision for publicity of the ES where 
an application for planning permission has been made without an environmental 
statement and the applicant proposes to submit such a statement.60 In such 
circumstances, the applicant is required to publish in a local newspaper circulating 
in the locality in which the land is situated, a notice stating inter alia: the applicant’s 
name; that an application is being made for planning permission (or subsequent 
consent) to the planning authority; the name and address of the planning authority, 
or that of the Secretary of State (in the case of an application that has been made 
to the Secretary of State); the address, or location, and nature of the proposed 
development; an address in the locality in which the land is situated at which the 
ES may be inspected; that any person who wishes to make representations should 
submit them in writing to the planning authority, or to the Secretary of State (in the 
case of an application made, or referred to the Secretary of State, or of an appeal); 
and the address to which representations should be sent.61
The relevant planning authority is required to make the ES available for inspection 
on a website maintained by, or on behalf, of the planning authority.62 An applicant 
for planning permission, or subsequent consent, or an appellant who submits an 
ES in connection with an appeal, is required to ensure that a reasonable number 
of copies are available at the address that has been named in notices published, or 
posted, in terms of the Town and Country Planning (Section 62A Applications) 
Order 2013 or reg 20.63
Where an EIA application is determined by a local planning authority, the 
authority is required to promptly, inter alia, inform the public of the decision by 
local advertisement or by such other means as are reasonable in the circumstances, 
and the main reasons and considerations on which the decision is based.64 Similar 
requirements apply in relation to an EIA application or appeal that has been 
determined by the Secretary of State or by an inspector.65

Planning and Noise
Scotland
The Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Scotland) 
Regulations 201766 make similar provisions as the above in relation to Scotland.67
The Scottish Ministers exercise similar powers in Scotland as those possessed by the 
Secretary of State in England. In Scotland an environmental statement is referred to 
as an ‘environmental impact report’.
Conclusions
EIA has generated a plethora of case law in the UK. However, EIA is simply a 
procedure with which the relevant planning authority must comply before deciding 
whether a proposed development should be given planning permission. The process 
ensures that the potential environmental impacts of a proposed development are 
taken into account by the planning authority. In the planning decision-making 
process, the potential environmental impact as elicited by the EIA procedure ranks 
as a material consideration. As such, the importance, or weighting, that a planning 
authority accords to the EIA is at the discretion of the planning authority and is 
only challengeable on Wednesbury grounds.68 It automatically follows, of course, 
that the EIA process may indicate that the proposed development would have a 
significant adverse effect on the environment (that is, a so-called ‘negative EIA’) 
but notwithstanding this fact, the planning authority can quite legitimately decide 
to give the proposed development planning permission. However, frequently, the 
EIA process has been regarded by pressure groups who oppose a development as 
a formidable hurdle that developers must overcome in order to obtain planning 
permission. EIA is not intended to be a preventative process. Rather, it is a facilitative 
process that is conducive, at least in theory, to better decision-making by planning 
authorities. 
STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Essentially, a strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is an assessment of the 
potential environmental impacts of plans and programmes by competent authorities. 
SEA therefore has an important role to play as far as the control of noise is concerned. 
Speaking generally, whereas EIA operates at a micro level, a SEA operates at a 
macro level. In common with EIA, the SEA is purely procedural in nature. However, 
both regimes are largely complimentary. The purpose of an SEA is to prevent major 
effects on the environment being predetermined by earlier planning measures, before 
the EIA stage is reached.

THE SEA DIRECTIVE 2001/42/EC
Introduction
In common with the EIA, the SEA is EU-driven. A principal objective of the 
Directive is to provide for a high level of protection of the environment and to 
contribute to the integration of environmental considerations into the preparation 
and adoption of plans and programmes, with a view to promoting sustainable 
development by ensuring that an environmental assessment is carried out of 
certain plans and programmes that are likely to have significant effects on the 
environment.69 In essence, the purpose of an SEA is to prevent major effects on 
the environment being predetermined by earlier planning measures before the EIA 
stage is reached.70 While the EIA Directive is aimed at individual projects, the SEA 
requires assessment of plans and programmes that, in turn, set the framework for 
those individual projects which fall within the scope of the EIA Directive. The SEA 
Directive has the objective of introducing more transparency into the preliminary 
process that surrounds project development and also allows contributions to be made 
to the development of a strategic plan by the public.71 The SEA Directive is more 
procedural in nature than the EIA Directive, in that it will identify potential impacts 
from plans and programmes but does not lead directly to reducing impacts, which 
is the function of the EIA process. The SEA Directive also does not impose any 
substantive duties on the relevant authority. Rather, it seeks to improve the quality of 
decision-making for development by requiring the authority to assess the potential 
environmental effects of a particular plan or programme before its adoption.72
Scope of strategic environmental assessment
It is mandatory for an environmental assessment (SEA) to be carried out for all 
plans and programmes that fall within the scope of the SEA Directive that are 
likely to have significant environmental effects.73 An environmental assessment 
is required to be carried out for all plans and programmes that are prepared for 
forestry, fisheries, energy, industry, transport, waste management, water management, 
telecommunications, tourism, town and country planning, or land use, and which 
set the framework for future development consent of projects that require an EIA 
or which, in view of the likely effect on sites, have been determined to require an 
assessment in terms of arts 6 or 7 of Directive 92/43/EEC (the Habitats Directive). 
However, plans and programmes that simply determine the use of small areas at local 
level, require an environmental assessment only where the Member States determine 
that they are likely to have significant environmental effects. The SEA Directive, 
therefore, makes an important link between SEA and EIA.

Planning and Noise
The criteria which are required to be taken into account in determining whether 
the plan or programme will have a significant environmental effect are set out 
in Annex II of the Directive. The criteria include having regard, in particular, to 
environmental problems that are relevant to the plan or programme, the probability, 
duration, frequency, and reversibility of the effects, the risks to human health or the 
environment and the cumulative nature of the effects.
The SEA is required to be carried out during the preparation of the plan, or 
programme, and before its adoption or submission to the relevant legislative 
procedure.74
Meaning of ‘plans and programmes’
The SEA Directive defines ‘plans and programmes’ as plans or programmes, as well 
as any modifications to them, that are subject to preparation and/or adoption by 
an authority at national, regional or local level, or that are prepared by an authority 
for adoption through a legislative procedure and which are required by legislative, 
regulatory or administrative provisions.75
In Inter-Environment Bruxelles ASBL v Region de Bruxelles-Capitale76 it was 
held that for a plan or programme to fall within the scope of the SEA Directive, 
the adoption of the relevant plan was not required to be compulsory. Plans and 
programmes whose adoption was regulated by national legislative or regulatory 
provisions that determined the competent authorities for adopting them and the 
procedure for preparing them fell within the scope of the SEA Directive. Furthermore, 
a procedure for the total or partial repeal of a land use plan fell within the scope of 
the SEA Directive. In Cala Homes (South) Ltd v Secretary of State for Communities and 
Local Government77 the Court of Appeal held that a proposed revocation of regional 
strategies (which formed part of the development plan) by the government, in order 
to return decision-making to local planning authorities, fell within the scope of the 
requirements of the SEA Directive.
The issue as to what constitutes a plan or programme that falls within the scope 
of the SEA Directive was considered by the Supreme Court in Walton v The Scottish 
Ministers.
78 The case concerned a challenge to the Aberdeen Western Peripheral 
Route (AWPR). Proposals for a western peripheral route around Aberdeen had 
been in existence since the 1950s. The factual background to the case was that in 
2001 a non-statutory regional transport partnership, known as the North East 
Scotland Transport Partnership (NESTRANS), was established with support from 
the Scottish Ministers. Its remit was to develop a regional transport strategy for the 
northeast of Scotland. NESTRANS membership included relevant local authorities 
and also Scottish Enterprise. The regional transport strategy, which was developed 
to cover the period to 2011, was described in a NESTRANS report published in 
2003. That strategy was described as the Modern Transport System (or MTS). It 
comprised the local transport strategies that had been adopted by the relevant roads 
74 Directive 2001/42/EC art 4. 75 Directive 2001/42/EC art 2. 76 Case 567/210; [2010] Env LR 30. 77 [2012] EWCA Civ 639. 78 2013 SC (UKSC) 67.NOISE AND NOISE LAW

authority. Numerous schemes were described and costed in the report. One scheme 
included the AWPR. In 2003, the Minister for Transport announced that the AWPR 
would be promoted by the Scottish Ministers as a trunk road. However, in 2004, in 
the face of a campaign against the routing of the AWPR along a certain ‘corridor’, 
the minister instructed that work on that corridor should be reviewed and also 
that four other options should be re-examined. In 2005, the Minister of Transport 
announced that the route would comprise a ‘hybrid route’ (the ‘Fastlink’), that is to 
say, a route that differed from the options that had previously been considered in the 
earlier consultation exercise, in that Fastlink broadly comprised the whole of one 
option and part of another. In 2006 draft trunk road schemes, inter alia, under s 7 of 
the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984, together with an EIA, were published. Objections 
were made to the proposed Fastlink. One objection included a letter from Walton 
(‘W’), the pursuer. A public inquiry was held. However, its remit was confined to 
technical and environmental issues. In 2009 the Scottish Ministers announced 
their decision to proceed with the scheme, which was approved by the Scottish 
Parliament in 2010.
W argued that the MTS was a plan or programme that fell within the scope of 
the SEA Directive and that the decision to construct Fastlink was a modification 
of that plan or programme. Therefore, the decision was itself a plan or programme 
within the meaning of the SEA Directive. Furthermore, there had been a failure to 
comply with the requirements of the SEA Directive since there had been no public 
consultation.
The Supreme Court reserved its opinion as to whether either the MTS, or its 
associated strategies, constituted a plan or programme that fell within the scope of 
the SEA Directive.79 However, the court held that the decision to construct Fastlink 
was not a modification of the MTS within the meaning of the SEA Directive. 
The decision had been taken by the Scottish Ministers in the course of executing 
a specific project and had related solely to that project. Furthermore, the decision 
had not been taken in the exercise of any power to modify the MTS, or otherwise 
set a legal or administrative framework for future development consent of projects. 
Furthermore, the relevant development had been implemented in accordance with 
the procedures that were laid down for specific road projects under the Roads 
(Scotland) Act 1984. 
The Supreme Court had another opportunity to determine the meaning of the 
expression ‘plan or programme’ in terms of the SEA in R (Buckinghamshire CC) v
Secretary of State for Transport.
80 In 2012 the Secretary of State for Transport published 
a Command Paper entitled, High Speed Rail: Investing in Britain’s Future-Decisions 
and Next Steps81 (DNS), which set out the Government’s strategy for the promotion 
construction and operation of a new national high speed rail network, known as 
High Speed Two (HS2) from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. One 
of the issues that fell to be decided by the court was whether the DNS constituted a 
plan or programme within the meaning of the SEA Directive.
79 Lord Carnwath expressed serious doubts (at [99]) that the MTS was a plan or programme that fell 
within the scope of the SEA Directive, given the informal character of the NESTRANS exercise. 80 [2014] 1 WLR 324. 81 Cmnd. 8274.155
Planning and Noise
Lord Carnwath was prepared to accept obiter that the DNS could rank as a 
plan or programme that fell within the scope of the SEA.82 However, his Lordship 
concluded that since the DNS did not constrain the decision-making process of the 
authority that was responsible (that is, Parliament), the DNS fell outwith the scope 
of the SEA Directive.83
For Lord Sumption (who tacitly accepted that the DNS could be a ‘plan or 
programme’) the DNS fell outwith the scope of the SEA Directive, since it was 
nothing more than a proposal.84
In R (Friends of the Earth UK Ltd) v Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and 
Local Government85 the court was required to decide whether the revised National 
Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) required a strategic environmental assessment, 
on the ground that it constituted a plan or programme that fell within the scope of 
the SEA Directive. Dove J held that, given the fact that the NPPF was not a measure 
that was required by legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions that either 
regulated or determined the procedure for adopting it, and was a voluntary measure, 
the NPPF fell outwith the scope of the SEA Directive.86
By way of conclusion, it should be mentioned that, in Scotland, the Scottish 
Ministers are under a duty to prepare a National Planning Framework (NPF) and 
keep the same under review.87 In other words, the NPF in Scotland would fall within 
the scope of art 2 of the SEA Directive, by virtue of being required by a legislative 
provision.
Environmental report
If an environmental assessment is required, an environmental report (ER) must be 
prepared.88 The ER is required to identify, describe and evaluate the likely significant 
effects on the environment of implementing the plan or programme (together with 
reasonable alternatives) taking into account the objectives and the geographical 
scope of the plan or programme. 
In R (Friends of the Earth, England, Wales and Northern Ireland) v Welsh Ministers89
it was held that ‘reasonable alternatives’ did not include all possible alternatives. It 
required an evaluative judgement as to which alternatives should be included. That 
evaluation was a matter for the decision-maker, which was subject to challenge only 
on public law grounds.
The ER is also required to include the information that may be reasonably 
required, taking into account current knowledge and methods of assessment, the 
contents and level of detail of the plan or programme, its stage in the decision￾making process and the extent to which certain matters are more easily assessed at 
different levels in that process, in order to avoid duplication of the assessment. The

156
information that is required to be provided in the ER is contained in Annex I to the 
SEA Directive. The ER must also include a non-technical summary. 
In Spurrier v Secretary of State for Transport90 it was held that the information that 
was required to be included in an ER was a matter for the judgement of the authority 
preparing the plan or programme. Such a judgement was a matter for the evaluative 
assessment of the authority, subject only to review on normal public law principles, 
including Wednesbury unreasonableness.
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SEA
The SEA Directive is implemented in England by the Environmental Assessment of 
Plans and Programmes Regulations 200491 (the 2004 Regulations). However, in a 
book of this nature, only a brief overview of the Regulations can be given. 
Extent
The 2004 Regulations apply to a plan or programme relating solely to the whole, or 
part, of England, or to England (whether as to the whole or part) and to any other 
part of the UK.92
Consultation bodies
The 2004 Regulations make provision for consultation bodies in relation to plans and 
programmes falling within the scope of the Regulations. The Countryside Agency; the 
Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England (English Heritage); 
English Nature; and the Environment Agency, are made the relevant consultation 
bodies, only in relation to so much of the plan or programme as relates to England.93
However, in relation to a plan or programme to which the Regulations apply that 
relates to Scotland, the relevant consultation bodies are the Scottish Ministers; the 
Scottish Environment Protection Agency; and Scottish Natural Heritage.94
Environmental assessment for plans and programmes
The 2004 Regulations make provision for the environmental assessment of plans and 
programmes. Where the first formal preparatory act of the plan or programme takes 
place after 21 July 2004 and the plan or programme is prepared for:
(a) agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy, industry, transport, waste management, 
water management, telecommunications, tourism, town and country 
planning or land use; and
(b) sets the framework for future development consent of projects listed in 
Annex I or II of the Directive on the assessment of the effects of certain 
public and private projects on the environment,

Planning and Noise
the responsible authority95 is required to either carry out, or secure the carrying out, 
of an environmental assessment during the preparation of the plan or programme 
and before its adoption, or submission, to the relevant legislative procedures.96 An 
environmental assessment is also required in relation to a plan or programme that, in 
view of the likely effect on sites, has been determined to require an assessment, in terms 
of arts 6 or 7 of the Habitats Directive.97 However, an environmental assessment is 
not required to be carried out for any plan or programme that determines the use of a 
small area at local level, or for a modification to a plan or programme of a description 
that falls within the scope of reg 5(2) and (3) (above), unless it has been determined 
under reg 9(1) (below), that the plan, programme or modification, as the case may 
be, is likely to have significant environmental effects.98 Similarly, an environmental 
assessment is not required to be carried out if the plan, programme or modification 
is the subject of a direction under reg 10(3)(below).
If an environmental assessment is required for a plan or programme, the 
responsible authority is required to take account of the environmental report for 
the plan or programme as well as, inter alia, opinions received from the relevant 
consultation bodies.99 As far as plans or programmes that determine the use of small 
areas (or plans that consist of minor modifications to such plans) the responsible 
authority is required to determine whether such a plan, etc. is likely to have significant 
environmental effects.100 Before making such a determination, the responsible 
authority is required to apply the criteria specified in Schedule 1 of the Regulations, 
and also consult the consultation bodies.101 Where the responsible authority 
determines that the plan or programme is unlikely to have significant environmental 
effects and therefore does not require an environmental assessment, the authority 
is required to prepare a statement of its reasons for such a determination.102 The 
responsible body is also required inter alia to publicise such a determination.103
Preparation of environmental report
Where an environmental assessment is required, the responsible authority is 
required to prepare an environmental report.104 The environmental report is required 
to identify, describe and evaluate the likely significant effects on the environment 
of implementing the plan or programme, and also reasonable alternatives, taking 
into account the objectives and the geographical scope of the plan or programme.105
Schedule 2 specifies the information that requires to be included in the environmental 
report.106
95 The ‘responsible authority’ in relation to a plan or programme is the authority by which or on whose 
behalf, it is prepared: SI 2004/1633 reg 2(1). 96 SI 2004/1633 reg 5(1), (2). 97 SI 2004/1633 reg 5(3). 98 SI 2004/1633 reg 5(6). 99 SI 2004/1633 reg 8(2), (3). 100 SI 2004/1633 reg 9(1). 101 SI 2004/1633 reg 9(2). 102 SI 2004/1633 reg 9(3). 103 SI 2004/1633 reg 11(2). 104 SI 2004/1633 reg 12(1). 105 SI 2004/1633 reg 12(2). 106 SI 2004/1633 reg 12(3).NOISE AND NOISE LAW

Consultation procedures
Every draft plan or programme for which an environmental report has been prepared 
under reg 12 (above), as well as its accompanying environmental report, requires 
to be made available for the purposes of consultation.107After preparation of the 
relevant documents the responsible body is required to send a copy of the documents 
to each consultation body.108 The responsible body is also required to take such steps 
as it considers appropriate to bring the preparation of the relevant documents to the 
attention to the persons who, in the responsible body’s opinion, are either affected, or 
likely to be affected, or have an interest in the decisions involved in the assessment 
and adoption of the plan or programme concerned, as required under the SEA 
Directive (‘public consultees’). The public consultees are required to be informed inter 
alia of the address of the website at which the relevant documents may be viewed 
and downloaded free of charge, the fact that the documents can be obtained by email 
from the responsible authority, and also that the relevant documents can be obtained 
by post from the responsible authority (provided that it is reasonably practicable for 
the authority to provide a copy by post). The responsible bodies are required to invite 
the consultation bodies and the public consultees to express their opinion on the 
relevant documents and the period within which opinions must be sent. The period 
must be of such length as will ensure that the consultation bodies and the public 
consultees are given an effective opportunity to express their opinion on the relevant 
documents.109 The responsible authority is required inter alia to publish the relevant 
documents on a public website at which the relevant documents may be viewed and 
downloaded, free of charge, and also provide a copy of the relevant documents by 
email, to any person who requests such a copy.110
As soon as reasonably practicable after the adoption of the plan or programme for 
which an environmental assessment has been carried out in terms of the Regulations, 
the responsible authority is required inter alia to publish the plan or programme 
as adopted, its accompanying environmental report and a statement containing the 
particulars specified in reg 16(4) (‘the relevant documents’) on a public website at 
which the documents may be viewed and downloaded free of charge and provide a 
copy of the relevant adoption details by email, to any person who requests a copy, as 
soon as reasonably practical after receipt of that person’s request.111 The responsible 
authority is also required to take such steps as it considers appropriate to bring the 
attention of the public to the title of the plan or programme, the date on which 
it was adopted and also the address of the website at which the relevant adoption 
documents may be viewed and downloaded free of charge. The responsible authority 
is also required to take steps to inform the public that the adoption documents may 
be obtained by email and post from the responsible authority, provided that it is 
reasonably practicable for the authority to provide a copy by post.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the adoption of a plan or programme 
the responsible authority is required to inform the consultation bodies and also the 
107 SI 2004/1633 reg 13(1). 108 SI 2004/1633 reg 13(2). 109 SI 2004/1633 reg 13(3). 110 SI 2004/1633 reg 13(4). 111 SI 2004/1633 reg 16(1).159
Planning and Noise
persons who, in relation to the plan or programme, were public consultees for the 
plan or programme of certain matters.112 Such matters include the fact that the plan 
or programme has been adopted; the address of the website at which a copy of the 
plan or programme, as adopted, as well as its accompanying environmental report, 
may be viewed, or from which a copy may be obtained.113
Both the public and the consultation bodies require to be informed, inter alia, 
how environmental considerations have been integrated into the relevant plan or 
programme, how the environmental report has been taken into account, and also 
how the results of any consultations have been taken into account.114
Monitoring the plan or programme
The responsible authority is required to monitor the significant environmental effects 
of the plan or programme, with the purpose of identifying unforeseen adverse effects 
at an early stage and being able to undertake appropriate remedial action.115
Scotland
The SEA Directive is implemented in Scotland by the Environmental Assessment 
(Scotland) Act 2005. The provisions of the Act are broadly similar to those of the 
Environmental Assessment of Plans and Programmes Regulations 2004 discussed 
above. However, considerations of space preclude any discussion of the Act.116
TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING
A proposed development may pose a potential source of noise impact to the general 
environment. The advantage of the development management system as a mechanism 
for pollution prevention, is that polluting activities can be prevented at source.117 The 
planning system ranks as an anticipatory control that exemplifies the preventative 
principle, now well-ingrained in UK environmental law and policy. Indeed, it has 
been argued that the UK can claim to have adopted the principle long before such a 
principle became fashionable, and also before it featured in EU policy.118
Town and country planning has an important role to play in relation to the control 
of noise.119 The modern system of town planning in the UK was founded in 1947.

160
The Town and Country Planning Act 1947120 and the Town and Country Planning 
(Scotland) Act 1947,121 in effect, introduced a new system for the regulation of the 
development of land in the UK. Indeed, the town and county planning legislation 
has been described as a ‘daring experiment in social control of the environment’.122
In essence, the legislation vested the regulation of the development of land in the 
UK in the state. Put simply, if one wanted to develop land, one required planning 
permission. Owners of property no longer enjoyed the absolute right to build, or 
change the use of land, without planning permission.
Noise is required to be considered either when a development may create 
additional noise, or the proposed development would be sensitive to noise.
First, the law relating to England is covered, and then attention turns to Scotland, 
with special reference to planning and the control of noise. However, in a book of 
this nature only a brief overview can be given.
England
Role of central government in planning
Central government has overall responsibility for town and country planning in 
England. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities is currently 
responsible for planning policy in England (DLHC). The NPPF sets out the 
government’s planning policy for England and how the government expects such 
policies to be applied.123 The NPPF states that the planning system is to contribute 
to the achievement of sustainable development.124 One of the objectives to achieve 
sustainable development is an environmental objective, which includes minimising 
pollution.125 The NPPF requires that the planning system should be genuinely 
plan-led and should, inter alia, provide a framework for addressing environmental 
priorities.126 The NPPF also requires that transport issues require to be considered 
from the earliest stages of plan-making and development proposals in order that, 
inter alia the environmental impacts of traffic and transport infrastructure can be 
identified, assessed and taken into account, including appropriate opportunities for 
avoiding, or mitigating, any adverse effects.127
Central government is also responsible for providing planning guidance to 
planning authorities. As far as noise is concerned, DLHC has published Guidance 
on Noise, which advises how planning can manage potential noise impacts in new 
development.128

Planning and Noise
Role of local government in planning
Local authorities, that is, local planning authorities are, in effect, at the heart of the 
planning system. Since the inception of the modern planning system it has been 
recognised that elected members are familiar with their localities and, therefore, best 
placed to determine how land in the area should be developed. In this respect, local 
planning authorities are responsible for the preparation of development plans (now 
‘development plan documents’) and also granting planning permission.
Development plans 
Development plans act as a guide as to how land in a particular area should be 
developed. For example, a development plan could specify that premises that have 
the potential to generate noise are kept separate from buildings (such as houses, 
schools and hospitals) that may be adversely affected by noise. However, development 
plans have no immediate effect other than as a statement of what the local planning 
authority considers is desirable.129 Development plans, however, are of great 
importance in planning control, in that they influence planning authorities when 
they decide whether or not to grant planning permission for a proposed development. 
Indeed, in the UK we have a ‘plan-led’ planning system. Under s 70(2) of the TCPA 
1990 in deciding whether or not to grant planning permission a local planning 
authority is required to have regard inter alia, to the provisions of the development 
plan so far as is material to the application and to any other material considerations. 
Under s 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 a local planning 
authority is required to determine a planning application in accordance with the 
development plan, unless material considerations indicate otherwise.
‘Other material considerations’
The TCPA 1990 does not define the term ‘material considerations’. In effect, the courts 
have been required to determine the meaning of the phrase. As far as the control of 
potential noise from a development, first, one is required to ascertain whether noise 
as well as other forms of pollution ranks as a material consideration and, second, if 
noise, etc. does rank as a material consideration, to what extent, if any, can one take 
into account the effect of any regulatory controls (which would be exercised, for 
example, by the Environment Agency) that would apply to the premises after the 
premises become operational? These very issues fell to be addressed by the Court of 
Appeal in Gateshead Metropolitan BC v Secretary of State for the Environment.
130
In that case, the Northumbrian Water Group (NWG) had submitted an outline 
planning application to Gateshead Metropolitan Borough Council (GMBC) for the 
construction and operation of a clinical waste incineration plant. Since the plant was 
a prescribed process, in terms of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA), it 
was necessary for the prospective operators of the plant to obtain authorisation to 
carry on the process of incineration from HM Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP, now 
the Environment Agency) in addition to obtaining planning permission. Planning 
129 S. Bell and D. McGillivray et al (fn 118) at 406. 130 [1995] Env LR 37.NOISE AND NOISE LAW
162
permission was refused by the planning authority on the ground that potential 
pollution from the incinerator would have a negative impact on the environment. 
NWG appealed to the Secretary of State against the decision. An enquiry into the 
appeal was heard. The inspector recommended that planning permission be refused. 
However, the Secretary of State disagreed with the inspector’s recommendation. 
The Secretary of State took the view that concerns about atmospheric pollution 
could be satisfactorily addressed by HMIP in terms of the EPA regulatory regime. 
The former, therefore, granted outline planning permission, subject to conditions. 
GMBC applied to the High Court, under s 288 of the TCPA 1990, for an order 
that the decision of the Secretary of State be quashed. However, the application was 
dismissed. GMBC then appealed to the Court of Appeal. 
The key issue that the Court of Appeal was required to determine was whether 
the Secretary of State was entitled to decide that the controls under the EPA were 
adequate to deal with the concerns about air pollution from the plant that had 
been raised by the inspector. In dismissing the appeal, Glidewell LJ held, first, that 
potential pollution from a proposed development was a material consideration.131
The judge also held that when the Secretary of State was determining the planning 
application, they could legitimately take into account the powers that HMIP 
possessed under the EPA. The judge went on to conclude that the Secretary of State 
was justified in deciding that the issues that had been raised at the planning inquiry 
in relation to atmospheric pollution from the plant could be addressed by HMIP 
and, furthermore, could also be adequately dealt with by that body.132 Therefore, the 
decision of the Secretary of State could not be impugned.
The inter-relationship between pollution, planning controls and the relevant 
pollution regulatory regime came to be discussed again in R v Bolton MBC ex p 
Kirkman.
133 In that case, the claimant (K) was a local resident. He applied for judicial 
review of a decision by the defendant planning authority, namely, Bolton Metropolitan 
Borough Council (BMBC) to grant planning permission for the installation of an 
incinerator. K contended, inter alia, that when BMBC was determining the planning 
application it had failed to address potential pollution from the incinerator. At first 
instance, Carnwath J (as he then was) held that the impact of discharges from the 
incinerator ranked as a material consideration in terms of planning law. Furthermore, 
in considering that issue, the planning authority was entitled to take into account 
the system of controls available under integrated pollution control (IPC) unless it 
appeared to the planning authority that the discharges in question either would, or 
would probably, be unacceptable to the Environment Agency.134 It was therefore, 
legitimate for BMBC to leave the regulation of potential pollution from the waste 
incinerator to the Environment Agency.
The relationship between planning and pollution control was discussed in 
Hopkins Development Ltd v First Secretary of State and North Wiltshire DC.
135 The 
claimant (H) applied to the second defendant (NWDC) for planning permission in 
relation to the construction of a concrete plant on an industrial estate. NWDC failed

Planning and Noise
to determine the planning application in the required period. H, therefore, appealed 
to the first defendant (FSS). NWDC argued that the proposed development would 
be contrary to existing planning policy in that it would have a serious effect on the 
amenities of the area. The inspector refused the appeal on the basis that despite 
the application of existing pollution control measures, the proposed development 
would have a detrimental effect on the amenities of local residencies and businesses 
due to a significant increase in dust, noise and visual intrusion. H challenged the 
inspector’s decision under s  288 of the TCPA 1990, inter alia, on the ground 
that the relevant controls under the pollution prevention control regime would 
provide sufficient protection for those who might be affected by pollution from the 
plant. 
In dismissing the appeal, the court endorsed the approach of the courts in the 
Gateshead and Bolton cases (above) to the effect that the impact of emissions from a 
proposed development could rank as a material consideration in terms of the TCPA 
1990.136 Furthermore, a planning authority could take account of the pollution 
control regime. Therefore, the planning authority could leave pollution control to the 
pollution control authorities. However, the planning authority was not obliged, as a 
matter of law, to do so. In the last analysis, by focusing on whether the development 
itself was an acceptable use of the land and the impacts that it would have, rather 
than on the control processes or emissions, the inspector had acted in accordance 
with the law.137
Finally, the weighting that a planning authority attaches to a material 
consideration is a question of planning judgement for the planning authority or the 
Secretary of State, and subject to review only on Wednesbury principles.138
Planning conditions
A planning authority can control the potential negative impact of a proposed 
development by attaching conditions on granting planning permission. Under s 70(1) 
of the TCPA 1990 a local planning authority can attach conditions as it thinks fit. 
Whereas a planning authority has fairly wide discretion as to both the nature and 
content of a condition that it may impose, such discretion is not unfettered.139 The 
limits of the powers of planning authorities in imposing planning conditions were set 
out in the leading House of Lords case of Newbury DC v SoS for the Environment.
140
The House of Lords held that for a planning condition to be valid, first, the relevant 
condition required to be imposed for a planning purpose and not for an ulterior 
one; second, the condition required to fairly and reasonably relate to the relevant 
development; and finally, the condition was required not to be so unreasonable that 
no reasonable planning authority could have imposed it.141

See also Circ. 11/95, Use of Conditions in Planning 
Permission (Department of Environment, 1995). The circular suggests that a planning condition should 
meet six tests, namely that a planning condition is necessary; relevant to planning relevant to the 
development to be permitted; enforceable; precise and reasonable in all other respects: ibid at para 14. NOISE AND NOISE LAW
164
An important Scottish case that illustrates the application of the requirements 
that were set out in Newbury is the Inner House case of British Airports Authority v 
SoS for Scotland.
142 In that case, the British Airports Authority (BAA) had applied to 
Aberdeen County Council to carry out certain developments at Aberdeen Airport, 
including the erection of a new terminal building and a new aircraft apron. The 
Secretary of State confirmed the grant of planning permission by the planning 
authority, subject to two conditions that were designed to restrict the operational 
hours at the airport and also regulate the direction of both take offs and landings of 
aircraft there. Both conditions were imposed in order to reduce noise impact from 
the premises.
An application for planning permission had also been made by British Airways 
Helicopters Ltd (BAHL) for the erection of a one storey building in order to provide 
an office for its flight operations headquarters at its terminal. In this case, planning 
permission had been granted to BAHL, subject to a condition that was designed to 
restrict its operational hours at the terminal.
Bristow Helicopters (BH) had also applied for planning permission to build an 
extension to its terminal building at the airport in order to provide freight-handling 
facilities and additional office accommodation. Again, the planning authority had 
attached a condition to the grant of planning permission that restricted operational 
hours at the terminal. 
All three parties appealed to the Court of Session under s 233 of the Town and 
Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972143 against the conditions that had been 
attached to their respective planning permissions.
As far as the appeal by BAA was concerned, the court held that both of the 
conditions that had been imposed fairly and reasonably related to the proposed 
development. However, as far as the condition that sought to regulate the direction 
of take offs and landings from the airport was concerned, such a function fell to be 
exercised not by the Secretary of State but, rather, by the Civil Aviation Authority. 
The second condition was, therefore, ultra vires.
As far as the appeal by BAHL was concerned, the court held that the condition 
that related to operational hours was ultra vires on two grounds. First, the condition 
did not fairly and reasonably relate to the development in question, in that no 
helicopter took off or landed from any land that was occupied by BAHL. Second, 
and in any case, such a condition was unnecessary in that, since all aircraft took off 
and landed from runways at the airport, operational hours in relation to such aircraft 
fell to be regulated by the valid relevant planning condition that had been imposed 
on BAA.
In the case of the BH appeal, it was held that the condition that sought to restrict 
operational hours was ultra vires since it did not fairly and reasonably relate to the 
development in question, and also because the proposed increase in office/freight 
accommodation would not directly lead to an increase in air traffic and, therefore, 
more noise. The condition was both pointless and unnecessary.144

Planning and Noise
Scotland
The law relating to the control of development in Scotland is roughly similar to that 
in England.145 Planning is a devolved function under the Scotland Act 1998.
Scottish Government
As far as central government’s role in planning is concerned, the Scottish Ministers 
have overall responsibility for the planning system in Scotland.146 This includes 
initiating new planning legislation in the Scottish Parliament; drawing up national 
planning policies; determining appeals against planning decisions (a function 
normally delegated to a reporter)147; issuing guidance on planning policy in the form 
of Scottish Planning Policy (SPP); issuing Planning advice notes (PANs)148 and 
circulars; and preparing the NPF.
The National Planning Framework 3 (NPF3) was approved and published by 
the Scottish Parliament in 2014.149 The NPF provides a statutory framework for 
Scotland’s long-term spatial development for the next twenty to thirty years. A 
NPF4 is currently150 in the course of preparation.
The current government’s SPP sits side by side with the NPF. The legal significance 
of the SPP is that planning policy ranks as a material consideration that a planning 
authority requires to take into account when it determines a planning application for 
the development of land. 
(SI 2018/785) apply to airports that have more than 50,000 civil aircraft movements per year. The 
2018 Regulations make the relevant planning authority responsible as the competent authority for 
the purposes of implementing the provisions of EU Regulation 598/2014 (which makes provision for 
the establishment of rules and procedures in relation to the introduction of noise-related operating 
restrictions at airports within a balanced approach). A local planning authority is the competent 
authority for the purposes of the 2014 Regulations in relation to a proposal for it to impose, modify 
or discharge an operating restriction under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 or an operating 
restriction imposed under the 1990 Act: reg 3(1). See also the Airports (Noise-related Operating 
Restrictions) (Scotland) Regulations 2019 (SSI 2019/409). The Scottish Ministers are made the 
competent authority for the purposes of the 2014 Regulation in relation to Scotland: reg 3. See the 
Guidance on the introduction of noise-related operating restriction at major airports (Department for 
Transport, 3 October 2019). 145 For a discussion of planning in Scotland, see N. Collar, Planning, 4th edn (W Green, 2016); A.M. Slater,

Local government 
At local level, planning authorities implement the policies of the Scottish Ministers, 
prepare development plans,151 determine applications for planning permission and 
enforce planning controls. 
As far as the control of development is concerned, the TCPSA 1997 s  37(2) 
requires a planning authority, when it is determining a planning application, to take 
into account the relevant development plan so far as it is material to the application, 
and to any other material considerations. As is the case with the TCPA 1990, the 
TCPSA 1997 does not define the term ‘material consideration’. Therefore, the courts 
in Scotland have been required to fill the legislative gap. The decided cases south 
of the border on the meaning of ‘material considerations’, whilst technically are 
non-binding on the Scottish courts, are highly persuasive and indeed, are invariably 
followed.
Planning conditions
Under s 37(1) of the TCPSA 1997 on granting planning permission, a planning 
authority can inter alia attach such conditions as it thinks fit.152 Section 41A makes 
special provision for noise-sensitive developments in terms of the conditional grant 
of planning permission. A noise-sensitive development is defined as a development 
that is the subject of a planning application for planning permission if residents 
or occupiers of the development are likely to be affected by significant noise from 
an existing activity in the vicinity of the development (a ‘noise source’).153 When 
considering whether to grant planning permission for a noise-sensitive development 
under s 37 a planning authority is required to take particular account of whether 
the development includes sufficient measures to mitigate, minimise or manage 
the effect of noise between the development and any existing cultural venues or 
facilities (including, in particular, but not limited to, live music venues) or dwellings 
or businesses in the vicinity of the development.154 Furthermore, a planning authority 
may not, as a condition of granting planning permission, for a noise-sensitive 
development, impose on a noise source additional costs relating to acoustic design 
measures to mitigate, minimise or manage the effects of noise.
151 Under s 13(2) of the Planning (Scotland) Act 2019, which amends s 24 of the TCPSA 1997, the NPF 
becomes part of the development plan for an area. 152 See Scottish Government Circ. 4/1998‘The Use of Conditions in Planning Permission’ (published 
27 February 1998). 153 Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 s 41A(1). 154 TCPSA 1997 s 41A(2).167
Chapter 11
Noise in the Workplace
A worker’s health and welfare can be seriously prejudiced unless appropriate measures 
are taken to ensure that the relevant employee is not unduly exposed to noise and 
vibration. As far as the legal controls over noise in the workplace are concerned, the 
relevant controls take the form of both common law and statutory controls. Each is 
now dealt with, in turn. 
COMMON LAW
Place of work
An employer’s common law duty to protect their employee from excessive noise is 
derived from the ordinary rules of employer’s liability. An employer is under a duty at 
common law to ensure that their employees have a safe place of work and that a safe 
place of work is maintained.1
 Such a duty embraces an obligation to ensure that 
the employee does not sustain injury, as a result of exposure to noise and vibration in 
the workplace.2
The duty incumbent on the employer to provide a safe place of work for the 
employee remains when the employee is sent to work away from the premises that 
are under the control of the employer.3
 However, the employer’s duty in such 
circumstances is much lower. In determining the extent of the duty that is owed, 
each situation requires to be decided on its own facts. In some circumstances, the law 
will require an employer to carry out an inspection of the relevant premises to which 
their employee is sent to ascertain its condition. If the premises to which the relevant 
employee is sent presents an obvious potential risk to the employee, the employer 
is under a duty to inspect the relevant premises to ascertain its safety.4
 However, 
there is no relevant case law on the application of this general principle in relation 
to a situation in which the relevant danger emanates from noise. However, in most 
situations in which noise could present a risk to the employee’s health the relevant

company, which had allowed an employee to be exposed to excessive noise from a fire alarm for two 
hours on a single occasion, by reason of which the employee had suffered damage to her ears, had 
breached its common law duty to the employee.

state of affairs would be readily identifiable, normally by virtue of the existence of 
the relevant plant, etc. capable of creating the noise, or by virtue of the nature of the 
operations that are being carried out on the premises. In such a case, the law would, 
it is suggested, impose a duty on the employer to inspect the premises and also take 
such measures to ensure that the employee did not suffer injury by way of exposure 
to noise or vibration. 
System of work 
An employer is under a duty to ensure that all systems of work that the employee 
is required to perform within the scope of their employment are safe.5
 The 
significance of such an obligation, in the current context, is that the various systems 
of work must be of such a nature that the employee suffers no injury by reason of 
being exposed to noise or vibration. However, the expression ‘system of work’ has 
never been comprehensively defined and is somewhat elusive. In Speed it was held 
that the phrase included the physical layout of the job, the sequence in which the 
work is to be carried out, as well as the provision, where necessary, of warnings, 
notices and issue of special instructions.6
Under general principles of the law of negligence, the appropriate precautions 
that the employer is obliged to take requires to be proportionate to the relevant 
risk.7
 In Stokes v Guest, Keen and Nettlefold (Bolt and Nuts) Ltd8
 Stanwick J stated 
that the test of an employer’s liability for common law negligence was to be assessed 
on the basis of the conduct of the reasonable and prudent employer, taking positive 
thought for the safety of their workers in the light of what they know or ought to 
know. An employer was also required to keep up with developing knowledge and was 
required to weigh up the risk in terms of the likelihood of injury occurring and the 
potential consequences if it does. Against this, the employer was required to balance 
the probable effectiveness of the precautionsthat can be taken to meet it, and the 
expense and inconvenience that they involve. The employer is also required to take 
into account any relevant government guidance, such as codes of practice.9
Of practical significance, in the present context, is the extent to which the 
employer is under a duty to give warnings to the employee about the risks that are 
inherent in the relevant system of work. If the risk is insidious, which would seem 
from decided cases to be a question of fact and degree, there would be a duty to warn 
the employee of the relevant danger.10 The risk presented to the employee by noise 
or vibration is not readily apparent. Therefore, the employer would be under a duty 
to warn the employee of the relevant danger.
Another important issue, in practical terms, is the extent to which an employer is 
required to ensure, by taking affirmative action, that the employee takes the relevant 
preventative measures in relation to their own safety, for example, by wearing ear

Noise in the Workplace
protectors. As explained in the last paragraph, the requisite measures must be 
commensurate with the degree of risk involved. The law requires the employer 
to ensure that the relevant preventative measures are taken by the employee, 
notwithstanding the fact that the risk of an accident occurring is small but, at the 
same time, any injury would be grave if such an accident did occur.11 Furthermore, 
in determining the precautions that must be taken, the ramifications of any accident 
to any particular employee must also be taken into account.12
Finally, in the present context, in the House of Lords case of Qualcast 
(Wolverhampton) Ltd v Haynes13 Lord Denning stated that when considering if 
a particular employer has breached their duty of care at common law (including a 
duty to give appropriate warnings to the employee) one must guard against elevating 
decisions based on the facts of the relevant decided case into propositions of law 
that are of general application. Therefore, the conclusion should be avoided that in 
relation to certain types of work, the employer is bound to provide the employee with 
specific safety measures
Plant and machinery
Every employer has a duty, under common law, to provide their employees with plant, 
materials and resources for the performance of their work that are safe.14 The duty 
is a continuing one, and encompasses ensuring that the relevant plant, etc. is kept in 
a safe condition while available for use by the employee.15 The duty the common 
law imposes, in relation to plant and equipment, would include ensuring that plant 
and machinery cannot cause the employee harm, by virtue of being exposed to noise 
and vibration.
Protective equipment
An employer is under a duty to ensure that employees who are exposed to the risk of 
injury, are provided with suitable protective equipment, for example, ear protectors.16
Depending on several factors, including the risk of injury and also the gravity of 
potential harm, the duty on the part of the employer extends to ensuring that the 
employee is personally issued with protective equipment. In certain circumstances, 
an employer is under a common law duty to instruct the employee as to how such 
equipment should be used, and also persuade or insist upon the use of such equipment. 
This depends on the facts of a particular case.17 However, in certain circumstances 
(for example, where the employee is experienced) the employer can simply rely on 
the employee to use the protective equipment.18

Statutory control of noise in the workplace
Statutory law has also an important role to play in relation to noise in the workplace. 
The relevant controls are now discussed.
Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974
Section 2(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 provides that “[i]t shall be 
the duty of every employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health 
safety and welfare of all his employees”.
Section 2(2)(a) provides that without prejudice to the generality of an employer’s 
duty under s 2(1), the duty extends to provision and maintenance of plant and systems 
of work that are, so far as is reasonably practicable, safe and without risks to health.
Noise that affects the relevant employee’s health, safety and welfare would, 
therefore, fall within the scope of the Act.19 The duty to ensure the employee’s welfare 
is of practical importance, in that noise that is simply annoying to the employee could 
be dealt with under the Act. Therefore, it is suggested, in the absence of authority, the 
persistent sound of ‘piped’ music (or ‘muzak’) if it proved to be annoying to the staff 
of premises in which they are at work, could fall within the scope of s 2(1).
The Act is frequently used to found criminal health and safety prosecutions, 
though noise prosecutions are extremely rare. It should also be stated that no direct 
right of action for damages arises under the Act.20
The Control of Noise at Work Regulations 200521
The Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005 (the 2005 Regulations) implement 
Directive 2003/10/EC as respects England, Wales and Scotland.22 The aim of the 
Regulations is to protect persons against risk to their health and safety, arising from 
exposure to noise23 at work.24 The duties the Regulations impose are in addition to 
those contained in the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.25
Risk assessment
An employer who carries out work that is liable to expose any employees to noise, at 
or above a lower exposure action value,26 is required to make a suitable and sufficient 
19 Under 1974 Act s 3(1) every employer is placed under a duty to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable 
that persons not in their employment who may be affected thereby are not affected thereby exposed to 
the risks to their health or safety. 20 1974 Act s 47(1). 21 SI 2005/1643. 22 Similar regulations (SR 2006 No 1) apply in Northern Ireland. 23 ‘Noise’ is defined as any audible sound: SI 2005/1643 reg 2(1). 24 SI 2005/1643 reg 3(1). 25 See generally Controlling Noise at Work: The Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005. Guidance on 
Regulations, 3rd edn (L108, (HSE, 2021). See also Noise at Work: A brief guide to controlling the risks
(HSE, November 2012). See also Sound Advice: Control of noise in music and entertainment (HSE, 2008) 
and Sound solutions for the food and drinks industry, 2nd edn (HSE, 2013). 26 ‘Lower exposure action value’ means the lower of the two levels of daily or weekly personal noise 
exposure or of peak sound pressure set out in reg 4 that, if reached or exceeded, require specific action 
to be taken to reduce risk: SI 2005/1643 reg 2(1). ‘Daily personal noise exposure’ means the level 171
Noise in the Workplace
assessment of the risk from that noise to health and safety of those employees.27
The risk assessment is required to identify the measures that are needed to meet the 
requirements of the regulations. In conducting the risk assessment, the employer is 
required to assess the levels of noise to which workers are exposed by means of: (a) 
observation of specific working practices; (b) reference to relevant information on 
the probable levels of noise, corresponding to any equipment used in the particular 
working conditions; and (c) if necessary, measurement of the level of noise to which 
their employees are likely to be exposed.28 The employer is required to assess whether 
any employees are likely to be exposed to noise at or above a lower exposure action 
value, an upper exposure action value29 or an exposure limit value.30
The risk assessment is required to include consideration of a variety of factors.31
Such factors include:
(i) the level, type and duration of exposure, including any exposure to peak 
sound pressure32;
(ii) the effects of exposure to noise on employees, or groups of employees, whose 
health is at particular risk from such exposure;
(iii) so far as is practicable, any effects on the health and safety of employees; 
(iv) any information provided by the manufacturers of work equipment; and
(v) the availability of personal hearing protectors with adequate attenuation 
characteristics.
The risk assessment requires to be reviewed regularly, and forthwith if:
(a) there is reason to suspect that the risk assessment is no longer valid; or
(b) there has been a significant change in the work to which the assessment 
relates.33
of personal noise exposure of an employee as ascertained in accordance with Sch 1 Part 1 taking 
account of the level of noise and the duration of exposure and covering all noise: SI 2005/1643 reg 
2(1). ‘Weekly noise exposure’ means the level of weekly personal noise exposure as ascertained in 
accordance with Sch 1 Part 2 taking account of the level of noise and the duration of exposure and 
covering all noise. The lower exposure action values are: (a) a daily or weekly personal noise exposure of 
80dB(A-weighted); and (b) a peak sound pressure of 135 dB (C-weighted): SI 2005/1643 reg 4(1). In 
McDonald (fn 2above) a part-time employee had been exposed to an average noise level of 82.3 dB(A) 
LEPd over a period of two hours on one occasion. It was held that one required to employ a daily, as 
opposed to a weekly, personal noise exposure action value to determine whether the employer was in 
breach of the Regulations. See Chapter 3 for a discussion of the measurement of noise. 27 SI 2005/1643 reg 5(1). 28 SI 2005/1643 reg 5(2). 29 An upper exposure action value means the higher of two levels or weekly personal noise exposure, 
or of peak sound pressure set out in reg 4(2), which, if reached or exceeded, require specific action 
to be taken to reduce risk: SI 2005/1643 reg 2(1). Under reg 4(2) the upper exposure action values 
are: (a) a daily or weekly personal noise exposure of 85dB(A-weighted); and a peak sound pressure of 
137 dB (C-weighted). 30 Under reg 4(3) the exposure limit values are: (a) a daily or weekly personal noise exposure of 87 dB 
(A-weighted); and (b) a peak sound pressure of 140 dB(C-weighted). In applying the exposure limit 
values account requires to be taken of the protection given to the employee by any personal hearing 
protectors provided by the employer provided in accordance with reg 7(2): SI 2005/1643 reg 4(5). 31 SI 2005/1643 reg 5(3). 32 ‘Peak sound pressure’ means the maximum sound pressure to which an employee is exposed, ascertained 
in accordance with Schedule 2: SI 2005/1643 reg 2(1). 33 SI 2005/1643 reg 5(4).NOISE AND NOISE LAW
172
Where, as a result of the review, changes to the risk assessment are required, those 
changes are required to be made.
The employees concerned, or their representatives, are required to be consulted 
on the assessment of risk in terms of the Regulations.34 The employer is required 
to record: (a) the significant findings of the risk assessment as soon as is practicable 
after the risk assessment is made or changed; and (b) the measures that they have 
taken and that they intend to take to meet the requirements of regs 6, 7 and 10 
(below).35
Elimination or control of exposure to noise at the workplace
The employer is required to ensure that risk from the exposure of their employees to 
noise is either eliminated at source or, where that is not reasonably practical, reduced 
to as low a level as is reasonably practicable.36 If any employee is likely to be exposed 
to noise either at, or above, an upper exposure action value, the employer is required 
to reduce the noise to as low a level as is reasonably practicable by establishing and 
implementing a programme of organisational and technical measures, excluding the 
provision of personal hearing protectors, that is appropriate to the activity.37
The actions taken by the employer in order to secure compliance with the above 
provisions are required to be based on the general principles of prevention, which are 
set out in Schedule 1 to the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 
1999 and are required to include consideration of, inter alia, the following:
(i) other working methods which reduce exposure to noise;
(ii) choice of appropriate work equipment emitting the least possible noise, 
taking account of the work to be done;
(iii) the design and layout of workplaces, workstations and rest facilities;
(iv) suitable and sufficient information and training for employees, such that 
work equipment may be correctly used in order to minimise their exposure 
to noise; and,
(v) the limitation of the duration and intensity of exposure to noise.38
The employer is required to ensure that their employees are not exposed to noise 
above an exposure limit value; or if an exposure limit value is exceeded, the employer 
is required forthwith:
(i) reduce exposure to noise to below the exposure limit value;
(ii) identify the reason for that exposure limit value being exceeded; and
(iii) modify the organisational technical measures taken in accordance with paras 
(1) and (2) and regs 7 and 8(1) to prevent it being exceeded again.39

the claimant had sustained injury after having been exposed to excessive noise from the playing musical 
instruments. 37 SI 2005/1643 reg 6(2). 38 SI 2005/1643 reg 6(3). 39 SI 2005/1643 reg 6(4).173
Noise in the Workplace
The employer is required to adapt any measures taken in compliance with the 
requirements of reg 6 to take account of any employee, or group of employees, whose 
health is likely to be particularly at risk from exposure to noise.40
Hearing protection
An employer who carries out work that is likely to expose any employees to noise 
either at, or above, a lower exposure action value is required to make personal hearing 
protectors available, on request, to any employee who is so exposed.41 If the employer 
is unable by other means to reduce the levels of noise to which an employee is likely 
to be exposed to below an upper exposure action value, he is required to provide 
personal hearing protectors to any employee who is so exposed.42
If in any area of the workplace under the control of the employer, the employee 
is likely to be exposed to noise, at or above an upper exposure action value for any 
reason the employer is required to ensure that:
(i) the area is designated a hearing protection zone;
(ii) the area is demarcated and identified by means of the sign specified for 
the purpose indicating that ear protection must be worn in the Health and 
Safety (Safety Signs and Signals) Regulations 1996; and
(iii) access to the area is restricted, where this is practicable, and the risk from 
exposure justifies it.43
The employer is also required to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable that 
no employee enters that area unless that employee is wearing personal hearing 
protectors.44 Any personal hearing protectors, either made available or provided 
under reg 7(1) or (2), requires to be selected by the employer:
(a) so as to eliminate the risk to hearing or to reduce the risk to as low a level as 
is reasonably practicable; and
(b) after consultation with the employees concerned or their representatives.45
Any personal hearing protectors are required to comply with any legal requirement46
that is applicable to them.
Maintenance and use of equipment
The employer is required to ensure, so far as is practicable, that anything provided 
by them in compliance with their duties under the Regulations either to, or for, 
the benefit of an employee, other than personal hearing protectors provided under 
40 SI 2005/1643 reg 6(6). 41 SI 2005/1643 reg 7(1). 42 SI 2005/1643 reg 7(2). 43 SI 2005/1643 reg 7(3). 44 In Goldscheider (above) the court accepted the fact that it was not reasonably practicable for players in 
an orchestra pit to perform if they were required to wear personal hearing protectors at all times. 45 SI 2005/1643 reg 7(4). 46 ‘Legal requirement’ means any requirement of the Personal Protective Equipment Regulations 2002 
or Regulation (EU) 2016/425 of the European Parliament and of the Council on personal protective 
equipment and repealing Council Directive 89/686/EEC: SI 2005/1643 reg 7(5).NOISE AND NOISE LAW
174
reg 7(1), is fully and properly used.47 The employer is also required to ensure that 
anything provided by them in compliance with their duties under the Regulations 
is maintained in an efficient state, in efficient order, and in good repair.48 Every 
employee is required to make full and proper use of personal hearing protectors 
provided to them by their employer, in compliance with reg 7(2), and of any other 
control measures provided by their employer in compliance with their duties under 
the Regulations. If the employee discovers any defect in any personal hearing 
protectors, or other such control measures, the employee is required to report it to 
their employer as soon as is practicable.
Health surveillance 
If the risk assessment indicates that there is a risk to health of their employees who 
are, or are liable to be, exposed to noise, the employer is required to ensure that 
such employees are placed under suitable health surveillance, which is required to 
include testing of their hearing.49 The employer is also required to ensure that a 
heath record in respect of each employee is made and maintained and that the record, 
or a copy thereof, is kept available in a suitable form.50 The employer is required, on 
reasonable notice being given, to allow an employee access to their personal health 
record, and also provide the enforcing authority with copies of such health records 
as it may require.
Where, as a result of a health of health surveillance, an employee is found to have 
identifiable hearing damage, the employer is required to ensure that the employee 
is examined by a doctor and, if the doctor or any specialist to whom the doctor 
considers it necessary to refer the employee, considers that the damage is likely to be 
the result of the exposure to noise, the employer is inter alia required to:
(i) review the risk assessment;
(ii) review any measures taken to comply with regs 6, 7 and 8, taking into account 
any advice given by a doctor or occupational health professional or by the 
enforcing authority;
(iii) consider assigning the employee to alternative work where there is no risk 
to further exposure to noise, taking account any advice given by a doctor or 
occupational health professional; and 
(iv) ensure continued health surveillance and also provide for a review of the 
health of any other employee who has been similarly exposed.51
An employee to whom the above provisions apply, must, when required by their 
employer, and at the cost of their employer, present themselves during their working 
hours for such health surveillance procedures as may be required for the purposes of 
reg 9(1) above.52

Noise in the Workplace
Information, instruction and training
Where employees are exposed to noise that is likely to be at or above a lower 
exposure action value, the employer is required to provide these employees, and their 
representatives, with suitable and sufficient information, instruction and training.53
Such information, instruction and training requires to include inter alia:
(i) the nature of risks from exposure to noise;
(ii) the exposure limit values and upper and lower exposure action values set out 
in reg 4;
(iii) the significant findings of any risk assessment, including any measurements 
taken, with an explanation of those findings;
(iv) the availability and provision of personal hearing protectors under reg 7 and 
their correct use in accordance with reg 8(2);
(v) why and how to detect and report signs of hearing damage;
(vi) the entitlement to health surveillance under reg 9 and its purposes; and
(vii) safe working practices to minimise exposure to noise.54
The information, instruction and training required under reg 10(1) requires to be 
updated to take account of significant changes in the type of work carried out or the 
working methods used by the employer.55
The employer is required to ensure that any person, whether or not their 
employee, who carries out work in connection with their employer’s duties under the 
Regulations, has suitable and sufficient information, instruction and training.
Exemption certificates from hearing protection
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) may, by a certificate in writing, exempt any 
person, or class of person, from the provisions of reg 6(4) (exposure to noise above 
a limit value) and reg 7(1), (2) (hearing protectors) where because of the nature of 
the work, the full and proper use of personal protectors would be likely to cause 
greater risk to health or safety, than not using the protectors.56 Any such exemption 
may be granted subject to conditions and to a limit of time. It may also be revoked 
by a certificate in writing at any time. However, the HSE may not grant such an 
extension unless:
(a) it consults the employers and the employees or their representatives 
concerned;
(b) it consults such other persons as it considers appropriate;
(c) the resultant risks are reduced to as low a level as is reasonably practicable; 
and
(d) the employees concerned are subjected to increased health surveillance.57

APPENDIX I
Chapter summaries and discussion 
questions
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
Noise can have a serious effect on human health. During the nineteenth century 
there was no national legislation dealing with noise. As far as the twentieth century 
was concerned, the Noise Abatement Act 1960 made noise pollution a statutory 
nuisance. The 1970s witnessed a growing interest in the effect of pollution, in general, 
on the environment. The Control of Pollution Act 1974 introduced the concept of 
noise abatement zones. The 1980s witnessed growing awareness that environmental 
noise was getting worse. In 1993 the Noise and Statutory Nuisance Act 1993 gave 
local authorities the power to deal, inter alia, with noise from burglar alarms and 
loudspeakers in streets and roads. The Noise Act 1996 inter alia made the creation 
of noise an offence, if it exceeded a given limit at night. As far as the twenty-first 
century was concerned, neighbourhood noise was being viewed, not as a free￾standing problem but, rather, as part of the wider problem of antisocial behaviour. 
Antisocial behaviour legislation was made by both the UK and Scottish Parliaments. 
The EU’s END Directive (2002), which dealt with ambient noise, was transposed 
into UK law. The UK government issued a Noise Policy Statement for England in 
2010. The Environment Act 2021 makes provisions for the preparation of targets, 
plans and policies for improving the natural environment. Such targets, etc. could 
contain provisions relating to noise.
CHAPTER 2 BASIC ACOUSTICS AND HUMAN PERCEPTION
Concepts important for the understanding of acoustics are introduced together 
with basic terminology starting with sound pressure level and its associated unit, the 
decibel (dB). The important difference between sound pressure level and sound power 
level are explained together with the concept of frequency or pitch and how sound 
travels from the source (whatever makes the noise) to the receiver (the person who 
hears the sound). A simple explanation of the way sound behaves in buildings is then 
provided, including the way in which it travels between rooms, and also from inside 
to outside and vice versa. The hearing mechanism is described, including different 
types of hearing impairment and what can be done to alleviate this with the use of 
hearing aids. The factors that influence sound perception in humans is discussed, 
including the importance of ‘non-acoustic factors’ and the concept of ‘noise’, which is 
used to describe unwanted sound. 
AppendixNOISE AND NOISE LAW

Question
Is it correct to refer to noise as pollution?
CHAPTER 3 THE MEASUREMENT AND ASSESSMENT OF NOISE
The basic objective noise measurement tool, the sound level meter, is introduced 
including its basic function, which is to convert a fluctuating pressure signal into its 
decibel value. The way sound level meters compensate for the differing sensitivity of 
ear at different frequencies by using ‘weighting curves’ (A-weighting, C-weighting, 
etc.) is explained together with the way decibel readings are aggregated over different 
time periods. Various noise ‘indices’ that are required to quantify noise are described, 
which are rarely steady as they vary over time. The significance of ‘tones’ in the noise 
(frequency analysis) and variation in noise level (temporal analysis) and the way they 
are assessed is described together with other ‘acoustic features’ and the way they are 
dealt with in noise assessment. Different approaches to assessment are discussed, 
including assessing the absolute or relative noise levels and the concept of noise ‘dose’. 
Finally, relevant noise assessment guidance and standards are described including 
BS4142, Methods for Rating and Assessing Industrial and Commercial Sound.
Question
Is it correct to have a British Standard that is very flexible in approach and with an 
outcome that depends on ‘context’? 
CHAPTER 4 COMMON LAW NUISANCE 
The law of nuisance protects the occupier of land from the unreasonable interference 
with their enjoyment of that land. The courts take a variety of factors into account 
when determining if a given state of affairs ranks as a nuisance, including social 
utility, motive of the defender, locality, duration and intensity, time of day, sensitivity 
of the claimant, social utility of the thing interfered with and whether the state of 
affairs complained of is typical of modern life. The author of the nuisance can be sued 
for the creation of a nuisance, as can the occupier of land, the landlord (in certain 
limited circumstances) and the licensor of the nuisance. There are certain defences 
to a nuisance action, including the defence of statutory authority, prescription and 
acquiescence. The remedies for nuisance are injunction/interdict, delaration/declator 
and damages.
Question
Should planning law have any role to play in the development of the law of nuisance? 
See Lawrence v Fen Tigers Ltd [2014] UKSC 13.
CHAPTER 5 STATUTORY NUISANCE
The Environmental Protection Act 1990 (EPA) designates a variety of adverse 
circumstances, including noise nuisance, as a nuisance. A local authority is placed 179
Chapter summaries and discussion questions
under a duty to investigate complaints of a nuisance. If a local authority is satisfied 
that a nuisance exists, it is required to serve an abatement notice. The EPA specifies 
on whom the notice is to be served. Provision is made for appeals against the notice. 
It is an offence to fail to comply with the notice. The EPA makes provision for 
penalties and non-compliance with the notice. Provision is also made to allow private 
individuals to take proceedings in respect of a statutory nuisance.
Question
Should the creation of a statutory nuisance simply be made an offence of strict 
liability, subject to specified statutory defences?
CHAPTER 6 NEIGHBOURHOOD NOISE
The legislation dealing with neighbourhood noise is piecemeal. The Control of 
Pollution Act 1974 gives local authorities extensive powers to deal with noise from 
construction sites and loudspeakers in streets and roads. The Civic Government 
(Scotland) Act 1982 makes provision for noise from musical instruments, etc. and 
dogs. The Noise Act 1996 makes provision for night-time noise. Provision is made for 
the service of warning notices and offences. The Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) 
Act 2004 makes provision for the service of antisocial behaviour orders in relation to 
antisocial behaviour, which includes the creation of noise. The Act also makes special 
provision in relation to neighbourhood noise. Provision is made for the service of 
warning notices, offences and fixed penalty notices, and also the power to seize 
equipment. The Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 makes provision 
for a wide range of antisocial behaviour, including such behaviour that causes noise. 
The Act makes provision for the granting of injunctions, the closure of premises and 
offences. The Licensing Act 2003 provides a unified system in England and Wales 
for the licensing of the sale of alcohol, the provision of ‘regulated entertainment’ and 
the provision of late-night refreshments. The licensing system is achieved through 
the provision of, inter alia, authorisations, personal licenses and premises licences. A 
licensing authority has power to attach conditions to grant of a premises license and 
club premises certificates. As far as Scotland is concerned, the Licensing (Scotland) 
Act 2005 allows a licensing board to impose conditions inter alia relating to the 
control of noise from premises that sell alcohol. The Civic Government (Scotland) 
Act 1982 gives a licensing authority power to attach conditions to premises used as a 
place of public entertainment. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 makes 
special provision relating to raves. The Fireworks Regulations 2004 regulate the use 
and supply of fireworks. The Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015 make 
provision relating to the traceability of pyrotechnic articles. The Local Government 
Act 1972 and the Local Government (Scotland) 1973 allow local authorities to 
make byelaws to control noise in their areas. The EU Industrial Emissions Directive 
2010/75/EU which has been implemented in the UK by subordinate legislation 
(namely the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations (Scotland) 2012 and the 
Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016), which make 
provision for the permitting of industrial installations. A permit could contain a 
requirement relating to noise from relevant premises. Waste management activities NOISE AND NOISE LAW
180
are regulated in England and Wales under the 2016 Regulations. In Scotland SEPA 
regulates waste treatment facilities under a licensing system, in terms of regulations 
made under the EPA. A licence could contain a provision relating to noise. Certain 
waste management facilities in Scotland are regulated under the 2012 Regulations. 
Landfill sites are regulated in Scotland by means of a licensing system under the 
Licensing (Scotland) Regulations 2003 in terms of which SEPA can regulate the 
emission of noise from such sites. Building regulations contain provisions relating to 
sound insulation of domestic premises. The Noise Emission in the Environment by 
Equipment for Use Outdoors Regulations 2001 makes provision for the control of 
noise from machinery and equipment. The Household Appliances (Noise Emission) 
Regulations 1990 prohibit the manufacturer or importer of any appliance that has 
either been manufactured or imported by them from doing so, unless the requirements 
of the Regulations have been complied with. 
Question
‘The law relating to neighbourhood noise is fragmented and requires to be 
consolidated and simplified in a single statute.’ 
Discuss. 
CHAPTER 7 NOISE AND HUMAN RIGHTS
Article 8 and art 1 of the First Protocol of the European Convention of Human 
Rights have been invoked on a number of occasions by individuals affected by various 
forms of pollution, including noise. Whether art 8 has been engaged depends on all 
the circumstances of the case, including whether the noise has contravened national 
legislation, its intensity, duration, the physical and mental effects of the noise, and 
whether the noise exceeds WHO environmental noise guidelines and those of other 
European countries.
In certain circumstances, the state comes under a positive duty to protect its 
citizens from noise pollution. However, in such circumstances, the state enjoys a 
certain margin of appreciation in striking a balance between the competing interests 
of the individual and the community as a whole. 
Question
Compare the law of nuisance with the ECHR in terms of the protection of individuals 
from exposure to excessive noise.
CHAPTER 8 TRANSPORT NOISE
The Rules of the Air Regulations 2015 prohibit the take-off or landing of aircraft 
within a congested area of any city, town or settlement except an aerodrome in 
accordance with procedures notified by the CAA. The noise provisions contained in 
Volume 1 of Annex 16 of the Chicago Convention requires aircraft to be certified 
before being allowed to operate. Noise certificates are issued by the CAA under the 
Civil Aviation Act 1982. The CAA is under a duty in terms of the Act, in exercising 
its aerodrome or licensing functions, to have regard to the need to minimise, so far as 181
Chapter summaries and discussion questions
is reasonably practicable, any adverse effect on the environment and any disturbance 
to the public from, inter alia, noise and vibration from the aerodrome. The Air 
Navigation Order 2016 allows the Secretary of State to prescribe the conditions 
under which noise and vibration may be caused by aircraft on aerodromes. The Act 
gives the Secretary of State wide-ranging control over aircraft noise from designated 
aerodromes. An important device to reduce the impact of noise on the ground of 
those living in the vicinity of airports from aircraft taking off at the airport, is the use 
of noise preferential routes (NPRs) at airports. NPRs have been established under 
the Act for designated aerodromes. Some local authorities have established NPRs 
under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Some NPRs have been established 
voluntarily. An airport operator may establish a noise control scheme under the Act 
to reduce the impact of noise from aircraft taking off or landing at a non-designated 
aerodrome. As far as road traffic noise is concerned, the Road Vehicles (Construction 
and Use) Regulations 1986 make provision for minimising noise from vehicles. The 
defence of statutory authority may apply in relation to rail traffic noise. 
Question
Noise from aircraft is immune from civil action, in terms of the law of nuisance, if 
the aircraft has complied with the relevant provisions of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 
and regulations made under the Act. 
Discuss whether you consider such immunity justified.
CHAPTER 9 NOISE MAPPING
Environmental noise mainly consists of noise from transport sources such as road, rail 
and aviation. Directive 2002/49/EU (the END Directive) addresses this problem. The 
END’s main objective is to establish a common approach intended to avoid, prevent 
or reduce, on a prioritised basis, the harmful effects, including annoyance, caused 
by exposure to environmental noise. That policy is to be implemented inter alia by 
the determination of exposure to environmental noise through noise mapping and 
ensuring that information on environmental noise and its effects is made available to 
the public. The END makes provision for strategic noise mapping and action plans. 
The END has been implemented in the UK by subordinate legislation. In England 
the END has been implemented by Environmental Noise (England) Regulations 
2006. The Secretary of State has general responsibility for measures relating to the 
assessment, management and control of environmental noise. The Secretary of State 
is made the competent authority for the making, review and revision of strategic 
noise maps for sources other than non-designated airports. The Regulations make 
provision for the drawing up of action plans that are required to be kept under review 
and, if appropriate, revised. An action plan is required inter alia to prevent and reduce 
environmental noise and also preserve environmental noise quality where it is good. 
The Secretary of State is the competent authority for the drawing up and revision 
of action plans. The airport operator is the competent authority for major airports 
and non-designated (other airports) in certain circumstances. The Regulations make 
provision for public participation. The Secretary of State has the responsibility for 
adopting strategic noise maps and action plans.NOISE AND NOISE LAW

Question
Assess the general importance of noise mapping.
CHAPTER 10 PLANNING AND NOISE
Environmental impact assessment (EIA) enables decision-makers (mainly planning 
authorities) to take account of the environmental impact of their decisions. The 
Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 
2017 prohibit either a planning authority, the Secretary of State, or an inspector, 
from granting planning permission (or subsequent consent) for an EIA development 
unless an EIA has been carried out. An EIA development consists either a Schedule 
1 or a Schedule 2 development, which is likely to have significant effects on the 
environment. EIA includes the preparation of an environmental statement (ES). The 
ES is a statement that allows the planning authority to assess the environmental 
effects of a project. A person who intends to develop land may request the planning 
authority to adopt a screening opinion. A person who intends to submit an EIA 
application can also request the planning authority for a scoping opinion, as to 
the scope and level of detail of the information, which requires to be included in 
the ES. The ES is required to contain certain information. The Regulations make 
provision for the publicity of the ES. Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is 
an assessment of the potential environmental impacts of plans and programmes on 
the environment. An SEA is required for plans and programmes that are prepared 
inter alia for town and country planning and land use and set the framework for 
the future development consent of projects, which require an EIA. If an SEA is 
required, an environmental report must be prepared. The SEA is implemented in 
England by the Environmental Assessment of Plans and Programmes Regulations 
2004. The Regulations make provision for consultation procedures. The responsible 
body is required to monitor the significant environmental effects of the plan or 
programme. Town and country planning has an important role to play in relation to 
the control of noise. Central government has the overall responsibility for town and 
country planning in England. The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 
sets out the government’s planning policy for England and how the government 
expects such policies to be applied. Local planning authorities are responsible for the 
preparation of development plans and also for granting development consent. In the 
UK the planning system is plan-led. Under the Town and Country Planning Act 
1990, in deciding whether or not to grant planning permission, a planning authority 
is required to have regard inter alia to the provisions of the development plan that 
are relevant to the application and to any other material considerations. Under the 
Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 a local planning authority is required 
to determine a planning application in accordance with the development plan unless 
material considerations indicate otherwise. Noise from a proposed development can 
constitute a material consideration, as can relevant regulatory controls. The weighting 
that a planning authority attaches to a material consideration is a matter of planning 
judgement. Under the 1990 Act a planning authority can attach conditions on 
granting planning permission. 183

CHAPTER 11 NOISE IN THE WORKPLACE
An employer is under a duty at common law to protect their employee from excessive 
noise in the workplace. The duty remains during the period the employee is sent to 
work elsewhere. An employer is under a duty to ensure that all systems of work that 
the employee is required to perform, within the scope of their employment, are safe. 
This includes a duty to ensure the employee is not exposed to the risk of injury by 
being exposed to excessive noise or vibration. The appropriate precautions that the 
employer is required to take must be proportionate to the relevant risk. An employer 
is under a duty to provide their employees with plant, materials and resources that 
are safe. This duty would include ensuring that plant and machinery cannot cause 
the employee harm by virtue of being exposed to noise and vibration. An employer 
is under a duty to provide their employees who are at risk to injury with suitable 
protective equipment, for example, ear protectors. The Health and Safety at Work 
etc Act 1974 provides that it shall be the duty of every employer to ensure, so far as is 
reasonably practicable, the health safety and welfare of all their employees. The duty 
extends to the provision and maintenance of plant and systems of work that are, so 
far as is reasonably practicable, safe and without risks to health. The Control of Noise 
at Work Regulations 2005 make provision for the protection of persons against risk 
to their health and safety arising from exposure to noise at work. An employer who 
carries out work that is liable to expose any employees to noise, at or above a specified 
action value, is required to make an appropriate assessment of that risk. The employer 
is required to ensure that the risk from the exposure of their employees to noise is 
either eliminated at source or, where that is not reasonably practicable, reduced to 
as low a level as is reasonably practicable. The employer who carries out work which 
is likely to expose any employees to noise above a specified action value is required 
to make personal hearing protectors available to any employee who is so exposed. 
The Regulations make provision for the maintenance and use of equipment, health 
surveillance, information, instruction and training.
