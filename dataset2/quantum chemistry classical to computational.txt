1.1 DALTON’S ATOMIC THEORY
John Dalton in 1808 put forward a theory known as Dalton’s atomic theory. 
The main points of this theory are:
 1. Matter is made up of extremely small indivisible particles called atoms.
 2. Atoms of the same element are identical in all respects i.e., size, shape and 
mass.
 3. Atoms of different elements have different masses, sizes and chemical 
properties.
 4. Atoms of the same or different elements combine together to form 
molecules.
 5. When atoms combine with one another to form molecules, they combine 
in simple whole number ratios.
 6. Atoms of two elements may combine in different ratios to form more than 
one compound. Like C combine with O to form CO and CO 2
.
 7. Atom is the smallest particle that takes part in a chemical reaction.
 8. An atom can neither be created nor be destroyed.
Dalton’s atomic theory was the first achievement towards the smallest 
structure of matter called ‘atom’. This theory was able to explain the law of 
conservation of mass, law of constant composition and law of multiple 
proportion. However, it failed to explain the results of many other experiments. 
This leads to the discovery of many different types of sub-atomic particles in 
the beginning of the twentieth century.2 Chapter 1 Classical Mechanics

electron and proton, it was 
well-established that atom 
is divisible and is made of 
charged particles. This was 
further confirmed by the 
phenomena of radioactivity.
1.2 WHAT ARE CLASSICAL MECHANICS AND QUANTUM 
MECHANICS?
Classical Mechanics is the Newtonian mechanics, whose foundation was laid 
by the Newton’s laws of motion. The term “Mechanics” means study of motion 
and Issac Newton gave the laws of motion.
Issac Newton in 1687 gave three laws of motion:
 1. First Law: An object either remains at rest or continues to move at constant 
velocity until or unless acted upon by any external force. This law is called 
as “Law of Inertia”.1.2 What are Classical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics? 3 
 2. Second Law: Rate of change of momentum is directly proportional to the 
force. Mathematically,
 F ∝
dp
dt
 (p = momentum = mv)
 F ∝ m
dt
⋅
dv
F = m · a (a = acceleration)
 3. Third Law: Every action has an equal (in magnitude) and opposite (in 
direction) reaction.
 These are called as Newton’s laws of motion. Newton’s laws explain all 
the major aspects of a moving body and its motion. They describe the 
relationship between an object and the forces acting upon it and its motion 
in response to the said forces.
 However, later it was observed that Newton’s laws were well-followed 
by the macroscopic objects (which are visible by naked eye e.g.: falling 
stone, moving car, recoil of gun etc.) but they failed to explain the motion 
of microscopic objects (which are not visible by naked eye and we need 
high resolution microscopes to see them e.g., electron, atom, molecule, etc.).
 This was observed because macroscopic objects essentially possess particle 
nature, that is why Netwon’s laws provide extremely accurate results as 
long as the area of study is restricted to large objects. But, when the moving 
object becomes sufficiently small i.e., microscopic objects then they have 
essentially a wave nature due to which Newton’s laws fail to explain the 
mechanics of microscopic objects.
 The failure of classical mechanics to explain the laws of motion for 
microscopic objects gave birth to “Quantum Mechanics”.
 Quantum mechanics gives the laws of motion which microscopic objects 
obey, and they are different from the Newton’s laws of motion. Quantum 
mechanics was introduced in 1900 which was brought to account for the 
dual nature of microscopic objects i.e., particle nature and wave nature.
S. No. Particle nature Wave nature
1. Particle is localized in space i.e.
a particle occupies a well-defined 
position in space.
e.g., a cricket ball.
1. Wave is delocalized in space 
i.e. a wave is spread out in 
space. 
e.g., sound waves.
2. Two particles cannot occupy the 
same space simultaneously and do 
not interfere.
2. Two or more waves can co-exist 
in the same region of space 
and hence waves interfere.4 Chapter 1 Classical Mechanics
• Actually macroscopic and microscopic objects both have particle nature 
as well as wave nature. Now, macroscopic objects have essentially 
particle nature since the wave attached to a macroscopic object has 
a small wavelength which is not significant. The classical mechanics 
treats the moving objects as particle, therefore macroscopic objects 
are studied under classical mechanics. Whereas, microscopic objects 
have essentially wave nature because the size of microscopic particle is 
too small, thus the wavelength of the wave attached to it is large enough 
and thus significant. The quantum mechanics treats the moving object 
as wave, therefore microscopic objects are studied under quantum 
mechanics.
• Earlier (before 1900) when no such quantum mechanics was introduced, 
all the moving objects (macroscopic or microscopic) were considered 
to have particle nature and studied under classical mechanics. Thus, the 
various models of atom, such as Thomson model of atom, Rutherford 
nuclear model of atom and Bohr model of hydrogen atom are studied 
under classical mechanics. Since in all these models, the sub-atomic 
particles (like electron, neutron, proton, atom) are considered to have 
particle nature, thus all these above models are studied under classical 
mechanics.
1.3 J.J. THOMSON MODEL OF ATOM
J.J. Thomson in 1914, proposed that an atom was a sphere of positive charge in 
which number of electrons were embedded to neutralise the positive charge. The 
atom is stable because there is a balance between the inter-electronic repulsive 
forces and their attraction towards the positive charge.
This model is compared with cake or pudding in which raisins are embedded 
or with a watermelon in which seeds are embedded randomly. Thus, this model 
is also known as plum pudding model or raisin pudding model or watermelon 
model.
This model was able to explain the overall neutrality of the atom, but it 
could not satisfactorily explain the results of scattering experiments, carried out 
by Rutherford in 1911 and was rejected.
1.4 RUTHERFORD’S NUCLEAR MODEL OF ATOM—
DISCOVERY OF NUCLEUS
Rutherford in 1911, performed scattering experiments in which he bombarded 
thin foils of metals like Au, Ag, Pt or Cu with a beam of fast moving α-particles. 
(as shown in Fig. 1.1).1.4 Rutherford’s Nuclear Model of Atom—Discovery of Nucleus 5

From the results of the scattering experiments, the Rutherford model was 
given. According to Rutherford model of atom, the atom consists of two parts:
 1. Nucleus which is very small, carries positive charge and in which the entire 
mass is concentrated. The mass of the atom is mainly due to protons and 
neutrons, since electrons have negligible mass. Hence, protons and neutrons 
must be present in the nucleus. The presence of positively charged protons 
in the nucleus also accounts for the positive charge on the nucleus. It is 
present at the centre of the atom.
 2. Extra-nuclear part is the space around the nucleus in which the electrons 
are distributed.

protons and different number of neutrons).

number and different mass number (or different number of 
protons but same number of neutrons).
e.g.,

Isoelectronics The species (atoms or ions) containing the same number 
of electrons.
e.g., O2–, F–
, Na+
, Mg2+, Al3+, Ne, each of them contains 
10 electrons.
• Drawbacks of Rutherford’s Nuclear Model of Atom
 1. Unable to explain the stability of atom: According to Rutherford model, 
electrons are revolving around the small and heavily positively charged 
nucleus. According to Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory, whenever a 
charged particle revolves in a field of force (like electron revolves around 
the nucleus) it undergoes acceleration due to change in direction even 
if the speed remains constant and it starts loosing energy in the form of 
electromagnetic radiations (Fig. 1.2). Thus, the orbit of the revolving 
electron will keep on becoming smaller and smaller and ultimately the 
electron should fall into the nucleus.
+
Fig. 1.2. Loss of electromagnetic radiations by revolving electron.
 But, this actually does not happen and the atom is quite stable. Thus, 
Rutherford model could not explain the stability of the atom.
 2. Unable to explain distribution and energies of electron.
 3. Unable to explain the line spectra of the elements.
1.5 DEVELOPMENTS LEADING TO THE BOHR MODEL OF 
ATOM
It was seen that all the elements give characteristic atomic spectra or line spectra 
which could not be explained on the basis of Rutherford nuclear model of atom. 
In order to understand atomic spectra or line spectra, it is essential to understand 
the nature of radiation. The nature of radiation was first explained on the basis 
of “Electromagnetic Wave Theory” (Classical Theory) and then by “Planck’s 
Quantum Theory” (Quantum Theory).1.5 Developments Leading to the Bohr Model of Atom 7 
Thus, two developments played a major role in the formulation of Bohr 
model of atom.
 1. Dual nature of electromagnetic radiation.
 2. Atomic spectra or Line spectra
After these two developments, a new model of atom, called Bohr model 
of atom was put forward. This model of atom was able to explain the stability 
of atom and main lines in the spectra of hydrogen atom.
• Now, we shall take up a brief discussion of the above developments made 
one by one, before discussing the Bohr model of atom.
1.5.1 Dual Nature of Electromagnetic Radiation
 A. Classical theory of radiation or Electromagnetic wave theory (radiation 
has wave nature)
 B. Quantum theory of radiation or Planck’s quantum theory (radiation has 
particle nature)
 A. Classical Theory of Radiation or Electromagnetic Wave Theory 
 James Clark Maxwell in 1864, put forward the electromagnetic wave theory. 
The main points of this theory are:
 1. When electrically charged particles move under acceleration, 
alternating electric field and magnetic field are produced and 
transmitted. These fields are transmitted in the form of waves called 
Electromagnetic waves (EM waves) or Electromagnetic radiations. 
 2. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields produced by oscillating 
charged particles are perpendicular to each other and both are 
perpendicular to the direction of electromagnetic radiations.
 3. The radiations possess wave nature and travel with the velocity of 
light (c = 3 × 108
 ms–1).
 4. Unlike sound waves or water waves, these electromagnetic radiations 
do not require any medium for propagation and can move in vaccum.
Some important characteristics of a wave:

Trough Trough8 Chapter 1 Classical Mechanics
 1. Wavelength (λ): It is defined as the distance between any two 
consecutive crests or troughs.
 Unit: Å or m or cm or nm or pm.
1 Å = 10–10 m; 1 nm = 10–9 m; 1 pm = 10–12 m; 1 cm = 10–2 m.
2. Frequency (v): It is defined as the number of waves passing through 
a point in one second.
 Unit: Hertz (Hz) or cycles/sec (cps) or sec–1
 1 Hz = 1 cps = 1 sec–1
 3. Velocity (c): It is defined as the distance travelled by the wave in 
one second.
 Unit: cms–1 or ms–1
 In vacuum, all types of electromagnetic waves, regardless of wavelength, 
travel at same speed i.e., 3 × 108
 ms–1. This is called speed of light (c).
 c = 3 × 108
 m s–1
 4. Amplitude (a): It is defined as the height of the crest or depth of the 
trough.
 Unit: Å or m or cm or nm or pm.
 5. Wave number ( ) v : It is defined as the number of waves present 
per unit length. It is equal to the reciprocal of the wavelength.
v = 
1
λ
 Unit: cm–1 or m–1
.
 There are many types of electromagnetic radiations which differ from 
one another in wavelength and hence in frequencies. When these 
electromagnetic radiations are arranged in order of their increasing 
wavelengths or decreasing frequencies, the complete arrangement obtained 
is called electromagnetic spectrum. (as shown in Fig. 1.3).1.5 Developments Leading to the Bohr Model of Atom 9 1 Mm 100 km 10 km 1000 m 100 m 10 m 100 cm 10 cm 10 mm 1000 m 100 m 10 m 10 nm

wave theory: Some of the experimental phenomena such as reflection, 
refraction, diffraction, interference, polarization etc. can be explained by 
the wave nature of electromagnetic radiations, but it could not explain 
the following observations:
 1. Black body radiation (the nature of emission of radiation from hot 
bodies).
 2. Photoelectric effect (ejection of electrons from metal surface when 
radiation strikes it). 
 3. Compton effect (Scattering of X-rays)
 4. Variation of heat capacity of solids as a function of temperature.
 5. Line spectra of atoms with special reference to hydrogen.10 Chapter 1 Classical Mechanics
 These phenomena could be explained only if electromagnetic radiations 
are supposed to have particle nature instead of wave nature. Thus to 
explain the above facts, Quantum theory of radiation was given by Max 
Planck.
 B. Planck’s Quantum Theory or Quantum Theory of Radiation or 
Corpuscular Theory of Radiation.
 To explain the phenomena such as black body radiation, photoelectric 
effect, compton effect, variation of heat capacity of solids and line spectra 
of atoms, Max Planck in 1900 put forward Planck’s quantum theory. This 
theory was further extended by Einstein in 1905.
 The main points of this theory are:
 1. The radiant energy is emitted or absorbed not continuously but 
discontinuously in the form of small discrete packets of energy. Each 
such packet of energy is called quanta. In case of light, the packet of 
energy is called photon.
 2. Each wave packet is associated with a definite amount of energy. The 
energy of each quanta is directly proportional to the frequency of the 
radiation
E ∝ v
E = hv
 as, c = vλ
 E = 
hc
λ
 where, h is a proportionality constant called Planck’s constant.
h = 6.626 × 10–27 erg sec = 6.626 × 10–34 J sec.
 3. A body can emit or absorb energy in terms of the integral multiples of 
quanta
 E = Nhv
or E = 
Nhc
λ
 where, N is any integral number.
• Dual Nature of Radiation: Some properties of radiation like reflection, 
refraction, diffraction, interference, polarization etc. can be explained only 
if we consider radiation to have wave nature, whereas some properties of 
radiation like black body radiation, compton effect, photoelectric effect 
etc. can be explained if we consider radiation to have particle nature. 
Thus, Einstein in 1905 suggested that radiation has dual nature i.e. wave 
nature as well as particle nature.1.5 Developments Leading to the Bohr Model of Atom 11

Explanation of Various Phenomena Using Planck’s Quantum 
Theory
 1. Black Body Radiation: If any substance with high melting point (like 
an iron rod) is heated in a furnace, it first becomes dull red and then 
progressively becomes more and more red as the temperature increases. 
As this is heated further, the radiation emitted becomes yellow, then 
white and finally begins to glow with blue light. In terms of frequency, 
the radiation emitted goes from a lower frequency (red) to a higher 
frequency (blue) as the temperature increases.
 The variation of intensity with wavelength at two different temperatures 
is shown in Fig. 1.4. From the given figure, it is seen that on moving 
from right to left in the plot at a given temperature, intensity of radiation 
increases as the wavelength decreases (or frequency increases), reaches 
a maximum value at a particular wavelength, and then starts decreasing 
with further decrease of wavelength.
 If the substance being heated is a black body or ideal body (body which 
emits and absorbs all frequencies), then the radiation emitted by such a 
body is called black body radiation.

 The above observations cannot be explained by electromagneticwavetheory.
 According to Electromagnetic Wave Theory, the electromagnetic 
radiation are emitted or absorbed from a substance continuously in the 
form of waves. The energy of any wave is proportional to its intensity 
(i.e., square of amplitude) and is independent of its frequency. Thus, the 
energy of electromagnetic radiation is proportional to its intensity and 
not to its frequency. Thus, according to electromagnetic wave theory, if a 
substance is continuously heated, the radiation emitted by the substance 
should have the same colour (i.e., frequency does not change) although 
its intensity may vary. Thus, electromagnetic wave theory could not 
explain the phenomena of black body radiation.
 According to Planck’s Quantum Theory, when a substance is heated, 
the atoms present in the substance are set into oscillation and emit 
radiation of frequency ‘v’. On continuous heating, more and more energy 
is being absorbed by the atoms and they emit radiations of higher and 
higher frequency. As red light has minimum frequency and yellow has 
higher frequency, thus, the substance on heating first becomes red, then 
yellow and so on.
 2. Photoelectric Effect: When radiations of appropriate frequency strikes 
the surface of certain metals (like Cs, K, Pb), the electrons are ejected 
from the surface of the metal. This phenomena is called photoelectric 
effect, [Fig. 1.5(a)] and the electrons emitted are called photoelectrons. 
The apparatus used for studying photoelectric effect is photoelectric cell 
[Fig. 1.5(b)].

 Some important facts about the photoelectric effect are:
 (i) The electrons are ejected from the metal surface as soon as the beam 
of light strikes the surface i.e., there is no time lag between the striking 
of light beam and the ejection of electrons from the metal surface. 
 (ii) The number of photoelectrons ejected is proportional to the intensity 
or brightness of incident radiation.
 (iii) The kinetic energy of photoelectrons ejected is proportional to the 
frequency of incident radiation.
 (iv) The electrons are ejected out of the metal surface only if the incident 
radiation has a certain minimum frequency. This minimum frequency 
is called threshold frequency (v0
). If the frequency is less than v0
, 
then no electrons are ejected.
 The above observations cannot be explained by electromagnetic wave theory.
 According to Electromagnetic Wave Theory, the electromagnetic 
radiations are emitted or absorbed from a substance continuously in 
the form of waves. Thus, it is possible to accumulate radiations of all 
frequencies on the surface of the metal, and thus all kind of radiations 
(i.e., irrespective of its frequency) should be able to eject electrons. Also 
according to wave theory, energy is proportional to its intensity, thus 
the kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectrons should depend upon the 
intensity of the incident radiation and not on its frequency.
 According to the Planck’s Quantum Theory: Using Planck’s quantum 
theory, Einstein in 1905 was able to give an explanation of the different 
points of the photoelectric effect as follows: 
 (i) When radiation of some particular frequency falls on the surface of 
metal, the quanta gives its entire energy to the electron of the metal 
atom. The electron will be detached from the metal atom only if the 
energy of the quanta is sufficient to overcome the force of attraction 
of the electron by the nucleus. That is why photoelectrons are ejected 
only when the incident radiation has a certain minimum frequency
(threshold frequency, v0
). The minimum energy required to eject the 
electron (hv0 ) is called work function (w0
).
(ii) If the frequency of the incident radiation (v) is more than the threshold 
frequency (v0
), the excess energy is imparted to the electron as kinetic 
energy
 i.e., hv = hv0
 + kinetic energy of photoelectron 1
2
2
mv





16 Chapter 1 Classical Mechanics
 Hence, greater is the frequency of the incident light, greater is the 
kinetic energy of the emitted electron.
 (iii) Increasing the intensity of radiation of a given frequency, increases 
the number of quantas but does not increase the energies of quantas. 
Hence, when the intensity of radiation is increased, more electrons 
are ejected but the energies of these electrons are not altered.
 3. Compton Effect: When a beam of one particular wavelength (mono 
chromatic X-rays) of high frequency are made to fall on some light 
element like carbon, X-rays get scattered. These scattered X-rays have 
wavelength larger than the incident X-rays. In other words, the scattered 
X-rays have lower frequency or lower energy than the incident X-rays. 
This phenomena is known as Compton effect.

Fig. 1.6. Compton effect: Scattering of X-rays.
 According to Electromagnetic Wave Theory: The scattered X-rays 
should possess the same wavelength as the incident one. Thus scattering 
should be independent of the wavelength of the incident radiation. In 
the classical view, compton scattering is simply described as an inelastic 
collision process between X-rays and electrons of the scatterer. Thus, 
energy and momentum remain conserved even after the collision.
 According to Planck’s Quantum Theory: Using Planck’s quantum 
theory, Prof. A.H. Compton in 1921, was able to give an explanation of the 
scattering of X-rays. According to Compton, the phenomena of scattering 
might be regarded as an elastic collision between high energy photon of 
X-rays and the electron of the scatterer. When a photon of incident X-rays 
of energy ‘hv’ collide with an electron, the loosely bound electrons from 
the outer shell of atom or molecule, gains kinetic energy from the incident 
X-rays. Thus, the scattered photon of X-rays will have a smaller energy 
and in consequence, a lower frequency or greater wavelength than that 
of the incident photon. The ejected electron is known as Compton recoil 
electron.1.5 Developments Leading to the Bohr Model of Atom 17 
 (Loss in photon energy = Gain in electron energy).
 It was also seen that the decrease in frequency or increase in wavelength 
of scattered X-rays varied with direction followed by the incident beam 
of X-rays.

	 4.	 Specific Heat of Solids: Heat appears as a rise in temperature of the system 
in case of heat absorbed by the system. The increase in temperature is 
proportional to the heat transferred
 q = Coefficient × DT
 q = C × DT18 Chapter 1 Classical Mechanics
 The coefficient C is called heat capacity and its magnitude depends on 
the size, composition and nature of the system.
 Now,
 C = 
q
∆T
 If C is large, a given amount of heat results in only a small temperature 
rise. Like: water has a large heat capacity i.e. a lot of energy is needed to 
raise its temperature.
 Heat capacity	 (C): It is the quantity of heat required to raise the 
temperature of a substance by one degree celcius (or one kelvin).

temperature of one mole of a substance by one degree celcius (or one

 According to Electromagnetic Wave Theory: Lavosier and Laplace had 
determined the specific heats of a number of metals with considerable 
accuracy. In 1819, Pierre Louis Dulong and Alexis Thèrèse Petit, pointed 
out that, using the accepted atomic weights for many metals and multiplying 
them by the specific heats, an approximate constant figure was obtained for 
each metal. The average value of this constant is 6.4. The product is termed 
as atomic heat. Thus, Dulong and Petit gave their law such as:
 “At room temperature, the product of the specific heat and the atomic 
weight of a solid is a constant for all solid elements, and is approximate 
equal to 6.4”.
 Atomic heat = Specific heat × Atomic weight ≈ 6.4
 Success of this law was that when this law was applied to different solid 
substances, it was found that the atomic heat is almost constant at about 
6.2 ± 0.4 cals/degree inspite increase in the atomic weights from 7 to 200.
 The various exceptions to Dulong and Petit’s law are:
 1. According to Dulong and Petit’s law, the atomic heats at room 
temperature of all solids must be about 6.4. Actually, this is not true.
 For example, the elements Be, B, C and Si have exceptionally low 
atomic heats; the values at ordinary temperature being 3.5, 2.5, 1.35 
and 4.7 kcals/deg respectively.1.5 Developments Leading to the Bohr Model of Atom 19 
 2. As the atomic weight of an element is constant, the atomic heat must 
also be constant, i.e. its value should be same at all temperatures. This 
is contrary to the observed facts.
 For example, Diamond shows variation of atomic heats with 
temperature. Similarly, Si, the atomic heat increases rapidly with 
temperature and reaches fairly constant value above 200°C.
 From this we conclude that, Dulong and Petit’s law would apply to 
all substances provided the temperature is high enough.
 3. Measurement of specific heats at low temperatures indicates that 
atomic heat decreases slowly with fall of temperature and below a 
certain temperature, characteristic of each element, the atomic heat 
decreases rapidly, tending finally to the zero value at the absolute 
zero of temperature. This type of change is not permitted by the law 
of Dulong and Petit.
 Thus, we can say that: “The law of Dulong and Petit is entirely 
accidental and the atomic heat of 6.4 cals/degree has a theoretical 
significance only.”
 According to the Planck’s Quantum Theory: The quantum theory 
of the heat capacity of solids was developed by A. Einstein in 1907 
and P. Debye in 1912. The theory is based on the quantisation of the 
vibrational motion of the atoms in a crystal.
	Einstein’s Theory on the Heat Capacities of Solids: Einstein 
assumed three things when he investigated the heat capacity of solids. 
First, he assumed that each solid was composed of a lattice structure 
consisting of N atoms. Each atom was treated as moving independently 
in three dimensions within the lattice (3 degrees of freedom). This 
meant that the entire lattice’s vibrational motion could be described 
by a total of 3N motions, or degrees of freedom. Secondly, he assumed 
that the atoms inside the solid lattice did not interact with each other 
and thirdly, all of the atoms inside the solid vibrated at the same 
frequency. The third point highlights the main difference in Einstein’s 
and Debye’s two models.
 Einstein’s first point is accurate because the experimental data 
supported his hypothesis, however his second point is not because 
if atoms inside a solid could not interact sound could not propagate 
through it. For example, a tuning fork’s atoms, when struck, interact 
with one another to create sound which travels through air to the 
listener’s ear. Atoms also interact is a solid when they are heated. 
Take for example a frying pan. If the pan is heated on one side, the 
heat transfers throughout the metal effectively warming the entire 20 Chapter 1 Classical Mechanics
pan. Molecules that make up the frying pan interact to transfer heat. 
Much in the same way the oscillators in a solid interact when energy 
is added to the system. The extent of these interactions lead to the 
physically observed heat capacity.

 The Einstein temperature’s accesibility of the vibrational energy inside 
of a solid molecule determines the heat capacity of that solid. The 
greater the accesibility the greater the heat capacity. If the vibrational 
energy is easily accesible the collisions in the molecule have a greater 
probability of exciting the atom into an upper vibrational level. This 
is displayed below.
Einstein = 1.0 T Einstein = 4.0 T Einstein T = 10
Vibrational States of Excitement
Fig. 1.7. The figure illustates the effect of the Einstein temperature on the likelihood 
of an oscillator absorbing energy from a collision and tranferring that energy into 
stored heat or heat capacity. As the Einstein temperature increases, the greater 
the probability of an oscillator being excited to the next vibrational state.1.5 Developments Leading to the Bohr Model of Atom 21 
 For temperatures very large compared with the Einstein temerature.
 Cv
≈ 3 NK = 3nR. ...(3)
 Thus the high temperature limit of Einstein’s equation gives the value 
of Dulong and Petit. The failure of their law becomes evident when 
we examine the low temperature limit. For θE

 As T approaches zero, Cv
 also goes to zero, since the exponential

2.
 Einstein’s theory also explains low heat capacities of some elements 
at moderately high for temperatures. If an element (like diamond) 
has a large Einstein temperature, the ratio θE
/T will be large even for 
temperatures well above absolute zero, and Cv
 will be small. For such 
an element θE
≡ hn/K must be very large and, according, n, must be 
large. For an oscillator with force constant k and reduced mass m, the 
oscillator frequency is
n = 
1

 ...(5)
 A large frequency value suggests a small reduced mass or a large 
force constant, corresponding to lighter elements and elements that 
produce very hard crystals. The theory correctly predicts the failure 
of the law of Dulong and Petit for those elemetns. As an example, 
the heat capacity of diamond approaches 3 NK only at extremely high 
temperatures (θE
 = 1450 K for diamond).
 5. Line spectra of atoms with special reference to hydrogen
 (detailed explanation given in next section 1.5.2)
1.5.2 Emission and Absorption Spectra
• Interaction of electromagnetic radiations with matter produces spectra. 
The branch of science dealing with the study of spectra is called 
spectroscopy.
• An instrument used to separate the radiations of different wavelengths (or 
frequencies) is called spectroscope. A spectroscope consists of a prism 
or a diffraction grating for the dispersion of radiations and a telescope 
to examine the emergent radiations with the human eye.22 Chapter 1 Classical Mechanics
• The spectra are broadly classified into: 
A. Emission spectra
B. Absorption spectra
SPECTRA
A. Emission spectra B. Aborption Spectra
1. Continuous
Spectra
2. Line Spectra or
Atomic Spectra
 A. Emission Spectra: When electromagnetic radiation interacts with matter, 
(like by passing electric discharge through a gas at low pressure or by 
heating some substance at high temperature etc.), then atoms and molecules 
may absorb energy and reach to a higher energy state. With higher energy, 
these are in an unstable state. For returning to their normal energy state, 
the atoms and molecules emit radiations. When these emitted radiations are 
passed directly through the prism and then received on the photographic 
plate, the spectra obtained is called ‘Emission Spectra’.
 Depending upon the source of radiation, the emission spectra are mainly 
of two types:
 1. Continuous Spectra: When radiations from any source such as sun, 
a bulb or any hot glowing body are passed directly through a prism, it 
splits up into seven different colours from violet to red (like rainbow). 
These colours are so continuous that each of them merges into the next. 
The spectra obtained is called Continuous Spectra.
 2. Line Spectra or Atomic Spectra: When some substance (like volatile 
salt) is heated at high temperature or an electric discharge is passed 
through a gas at low pressure, the radiations are emitted. When these 
radiations are passed directly through a prism, it is found that no 
continuous spectra is obtained but some isolated coloured lines are 
obtained on the photographic plate separated from each other by dark 
spaces. The spectra obtained is called Line Spectra. Each line in the 
spectra corresponds to a particular wavelength.1.5 Developments Leading to the Bohr Model of Atom 23 
 Each element gives its own characteristic line spectra, differing from 
those of all other elements. Hence, spectra of the elements are regarded 
as their finger prints differing from each other like the finger prints of 
the human beings. Since spectra of most of the elements consists of a 
number of bright lines separated by dark lines, that is why line spectra 
is also called atomic spectra.
 B. Absorption Spectra: When white light from any source is passed through 
the solution or vapours of a chemical substance, then some wavelengths are 
absorbed, depending upon the nature of the element. After absorption of 
certain wavelengths, the transmitted light is analysed by the spectroscope, 
then it is observed that some dark lines are obtained in the continuous 
spectra of the white light which is irradiated on the source. Further, it is 
observed that the dark lines are at the same place where coloured lines are 
obtained in the emission spectra of the same substance. The spectra obtained 
is called absorption spectra. Absorption spectra is always discontinuous 
spectra consisting of dark lines.
• Line Emission Spectra of Hydrogen
When an electric discharge is passed through gaseous hydrogen at low 
pressure, hydrogen molecules dissociate and the energetically excited 
hydrogen atoms produced emit radiations of discrete frequencies. The 
emitted radiations are examined with a spectroscope, and the spectra 
obtained is called the emission spectra of hydrogen (as shown Fig. 1.8). 
The hydrogen spectra consists of a large number of lines which are 
grouped into different series, named after the discoverers.
Line spectra of hydrogen atom is simplest because hydrogen being the 
lightest element, the number of lines produced in the spectra is minimum. 
As the molecular mass of the gas increases, the spectra becomes more 
and more complex.

• Explanation of Line Emission Spectra using Planck’s Quantum 
Theory: Max Planck gave a theoretical explanation of the spectrum of 
radiation emitted by an object that glows when heated. He suggested 1.5 Developments Leading to the Bohr Model of Atom 25 
that the walls of a glowing solid could be imagined to contain a series 
of resonators (or particles) that oscillate at different frequencies. These 
resonators gain energy in the form of heat from the walls of the object 
and loose energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The energy 
of these resonators at any moment is proportional to the frequency with 
which they oscillate.
To explain the observed spectrum, Planck had to assume that the energy 
of these resonators could take only a limited number of values. In other 
words, the spectrum of energies for these resonators was no longer 
continuous. Because the number of values of energy of these resonators 
is limited, they are theoretically countable. Thus, energy of the resonators 
in this system is therefore said to be quantised. Planck introduced the 
notion of quantisation to explain how radiation was emitted. Albert 
Einstein extended Planck’s work to the light that had been emitted.

1.6 BOHR MODEL OF ATOM
Neil Bohr a Danish physicist in 1913 proposed a new model of atom called 
Bohr model of atom. This was given to overcome the drawbacks of Rutherford 
model of atom. This model was based on Planck’s quantum theory. The main 
points of Bohr’s theory of atom are:
 1. An atom consists of a small, heavy, positively charged nucleus at the centre 
and the electrons revolve around the nucleus in circular path.
 2. There are large number of circular paths arranged concentrically around 
the nucleus, but the electrons revolve around the nucleus only in certain 
selected circular path of fixed radius and fixed value of energy. These 
circular paths are called orbits or allowed energy levels or stationary 
states as shown in Fig. 1.9.

+ K
n = 1

n = 2,

Fig. 1.9. Circular paths around the nucleus.
These energy levels are designated as K, L, M, N, … or numbered as 
1, 2, 3, 4, … . Also, the word stationary does not mean that the electrons 
are stationary but it means that the energy of the electron revolving in a 
particular energy level is fixed and does not change with time.
 3. Since the electrons revolve only in the orbits which have fixed values of 
energy, hence electrons in an atom can have only certain definite values 1.6 Bohr Model of Atom 29 
of energy and not any value of their own. Thus, Bohr theory of the atom 
leads to the concept of quantisation of electronic energy. Quantisation 
means that a quantity cannot change continuously to have any arbitrary 
values but can change only discontinuously to have some specific values. 
Thus the energy of the electron cannot change continuously but can have 
only definite values. i.e., energy of an electron is quantised.
 4. An electron did not radiate energy if it stayed in one orbit, and therefore 
did not slow down. Thus, as long as the electron remains in a particular 
orbit, it does not loose or gain energy. But when energy from some external 
source is absorbed by the electron, it may jump to some higher energy level 
(excited state). When the electron jumps back to the lower energy level, it 
radiates some amount of energy. Thus, energy is emitted or absorbed only 
when the electron jumps from one orbit to the other.
 5. The frequency (v) of radiation absorbed or emitted when transition occurs 
between two energy levels that differ in energy by DE is given in the form 
of Bohr frequency rule. Energy changes during electronic jumps (DE) is 
shown in Fig. 1.10.

 where, v is the frequency of radiation absorbed or emitted during jumping 
of electron and the expression is Bohr frequency rule.
 6. Like energy, the angular momentum of an electron in an atom is also 
quantised. The angular momentum of the electron can have certain specific 
values and not any value of their own. The only permissible values of 
angular momentum are given by
 mvr = 
nh
2π
 where, h is Planck’s constant; m is mass of electron; v is velocity of 
revolving electron; r is radius of orbit and n is any integer.
 In other words, only those orbits are permitted in which the angular 
momentum of the electron is a whole number multiple of h/2π. Thus, only 
certain fixed orbits are allowed.
Success of Bohr Model of Atom: 
1. Concept of Orbits: The stationary states of electron are numbered as 
n = 1, 2, 3, … . These integral numbers are known as principal quantum 
number.
2. Stability of Atom: According to Bohr theory, an electron cannot loose 
energy as long as it stays in a particular orbit. Thus, the point of losing 
energy continuously and falling into the nucleus does not arise. Therefore, 
Bohr theory was able to explain the stability of the atom.
 3. Bohr Radii of Orbit: The radii (r) of the stationary state is given by the 
expression

Derivation of Bohr Radii of Orbit
For an electron to remain in its orbit, the electrostatic attraction between 
the electron and the nucleus (which tends to pull the electron towards the 1.6 Bohr Model of Atom 31 
nucleus) must be equal to the centrifugal force (which tends to throw the 
electron away from the nucleus).

of radius ‘r’.

Thus, the first energy level (n = 1) which is close to the nucleus has lowest 
energy. As we move outwards starting from the first energy level, the energy 
of the levels increases. Thus, E1
 < E2
 < E3
 … < E∞
. When, n = ∞, E∞ 
= 0; this 
shows that at infinite distance from the nucleus, there is no force of attraction 
on the electron by the nucleus. Hence, at infinite distance, the electron is 
considered as a free electron at rest, where its energy is taken as zero. As the 
electron moves towards the nucleus, it starts experiencing a force of attraction 
by the nucleus, and starts radiating some amount of energy. Further, as the 
electron goes more and more close to the nucleus, the attraction increases and 
more energy is radiated out. Since its value was already zero, hence the energy 1.6 Bohr Model of Atom 33 
of the electron becomes less and less i.e., becomes more negative. Thus, the 
energy of the electron decreases as we move from the outer to the inner levels.

 6. Quantitative	Explanation	of	Line	Spectrum	of	Hydrogen	Atom:	Bohr 
theory provides a satisfactory quantitative explanation for the line spectrum 
of hydrogen. According to Bohr theory, as long as the electron remains in 
a particular orbit, it does not loose or gain energy. But when energy from 
some external source is absorbed by the electron, it may jump from the 
orbit of lower energy level to the orbit of higher energy level. Whereas, 
the energy is emitted if the electron moves from higher energy level to 
lower energy level. The frequency (v) of the quanta of radiation absorbed 
or emitted depends upon the energy difference (DE) of the two energy 
levels concerned. Corresponding to the frequency [or wavelength (λ) 
or wave number ( ) v ] of each quanta emitted, there appears a line in the 
emission spectra of hydrogen atom. The frequencies (or wavelengths or 
wave number) of the spectral lines calculated by Bohr was found to be in 
good agreement with the experimental values. Thus, Bohr theory shows a 
remarkable success in explaining the line spectrum of hydrogen atom and 
hydrogen like atoms (He+
, Li2+, Be3+ etc.)

 7. Qualitative	Explanation	of	Line	Spectrum	of	Hydrogen	Atom:	When 
a sample of hydrogen gas is heated to a high temperature or an electric 
discharge is passed, the hydrogen molecules split into hydrogen atoms. 
Since in a sample of hydrogen, there are large number of atoms, each 
containing one electron, thus the electron in different atoms absorb different 
amount of energies and are excited to different higher energy levels. Then 
from excited state, they return to some lower energy level in one or more 
jumps. Since large number of different types of downward transitions takes 
place simultaneously in a sample of hydrogen, therefore, large number of 
lines are obtained in emission spectrum of hydrogen (Fig. 1.11). Thus, 
Bohr accounts for the existence of large number of lines in atomic spectra 
of hydrogen atom, although hydrogen atom contains only one electron.
 The brightness or intensity of spectral lines depends upon the number of 
photons of same frequency (or wavelength) emitted (in case of emission 
spectrum) or absorbed (in case of absorption spectrum).

Limitations of Bohr Model of Atom
Bohr model of atom was an improvement over Rutherford nuclear model of 
atom. Although Bohr model accounts for the stability of atom and line spectra 
of hydrogen atom and hydrogen like atoms, but could not explain the following:38 Chapter 1 Classical Mechanics
 1. Spectra of Multielectron Atoms: Bohr theory was successful in explaining 
the line spectra of one electron atom (i.e., hydrogen and hydrogen like 
atoms) but it failed to explain the spectra of atoms having more than 
electron. Like: Helium atoms with two electrons.
	 2.	 Finer Details of the Hydrogen Spectrum: When spectroscopic techniques 
with better resolving powers were used, each line in hydrogen spectrum 
was split into a number of closely spaced lines (doublet i.e., two closely 
spaces lines or triplet i.e. three closely spaced lines). This fine structure 
could not be explained by Bohr model of atom.
 3. Splitting of Spectral Lines in the Presence of Magnetic Field and 
Electric field:If the source emitting the radiation and producing line spectra 
is placed in a magnetic field or electric field, then each fine spectral line 
further splits into a number of lines. The splitting of spectral lines in the 
presence of magnetic field is called Zeeman effect. Whereas, the splitting 
of fine spectral lines in the presence of electric field is called Stark effect.
 4. Three Dimensional Model of Atom: The Bohr model looks like a two￾dimensional model of the atom because it restricts the motion of the 
electron to a circular orbit in a two dimensional plane. But in reality, the 
Bohr model is a one-dimensional model (i.e., flat model of atom), because 
a circle can be defined by specifying only one dimension; i.e., radius (r). 
As a result only one co-ordinate (r) is needed to describe the orbits in the 
Bohr model. Unfortunately, electrons are not particles that can be restricted 
to one-dimensional circular orbit. They act to some extent as waves and 
therefore exist in three-dimension space. Thus, atom in reality is three￾dimensional.
 5. Ability of atoms to form molecules by chemical bonds and shapes of 
molecules.

1.7 SOMMERFELD THEORY OR BOHR-SOMMERFELD 
THEORY
With Arnold Sommerfeld’s extension of the Bohr theory in 1915–1916, it was 
turned into a powerful tool of atomic research and adopted and further developed 
by German physicists in particular. Bohr model of atom was able to calculate 
the radii and energies of the stationary orbits around the nucleus in an atom 
and the calculated values of Bohr were found to be in good agreement with 
the experimental values. But Bohr model was not able to explain the very fine 
spectral lines of hydrogen spectrum. When the fine spectral lines of hydrogen 
spectrum was examined under a high resolution spectroscope, it was found 
that fine spectral line was composed of several lines close together i.e., there is 
further splitting of these finer lines into very fine spectral lines.
The explanation of several lines originating in hydrogen spectrum was 
given by Arnold Sommerfeld who extended the Bohr model of circular orbits 
by introducing the concept of elliptical orbits. According to Sommerfeld, the 
stationary orbits around the nucleus in the atom are not circular but elliptical 
in shape. It is due to the influence of the centrally located nucleus. For the orbit 
closest to the nucleus. i.e., for the principal quantum number n = 1, there exists 
a circular orbit. For next orbit i.e., for the principal quantum number n = 2, 
both circular and elliptical orbits are possible. When the electron revolves in 
elliptical path with nucleus at one of its foci, there will be a major and minor 
axis of the path. To define elliptical orbit another quantum number ‘k’ was 
required. The shape of the ellipse is defined by the ratio of the lengths of the 
major and minor axes, 
major axis
minor axis = 
n
k
where, k has integral values upto n and is known as azimuthal or subsidiary 
quantum number. For n = 2, n/k may be 2/2 for circular orbit and 2/1 for 
elliptical orbit (Q, n = 2, k = 1, 2). For n = 3, k can have three values 
(1, 2, 3) so that n/k becomes 3/3 for circular orbit, 3/2 for elliptical orbit and 
3/1 for further narrow elliptical orbit as shown in Fig. 1.12.
k = 3
k = 2
k = 1
Fig. 1.12. Bohr-Sommerfeld orbits when n = 3.44 Chapter 1 Classical Mechanics
With increase in value of k, the path becomes more and more elliptical and 
eccentric. When k = n, the path becomes circular. 
The original quantum number ‘k’ was later replaced by ‘l’, new quantum 
number where l = k – 1 so that;
n l
1 0
2 0 or 1
3 0 or 1 or 2
4 0 or 1 or 2 or 3
The new and more general Bohr-Sommerfeld theory described the atom in 
terms of two quantum numbers (n and k), while Bohr had originally used only 
one quantum number (n). With this extension the theory provided an explanation 
of the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum and the Zeeman effect. 
 (a) Bohr was not able to explain the reason for the fine spectral lines visible 
by high revolving power spectroscopes but Sommerfeld explained 
the reason for the same. He said that the energy of the stationary orbit 
depends not only on n but on k to some extent as well. So when a 
transition of electron from a higher level to a lower level occurs, it would 
be different from what proposed by Bohr as there may be more than 
one values of k. In this way Sommerfeld was able to explain the reason 
behind those fine spectral lines. Even the frequencies of some of those 
fine spectral lines came to be in well agreement with the frequencies 
by Sommerfeld.
 (b) Further Zeeman effect was also explained by Sommerfeld. The 
Zeeman effect was experienced under the strong external magnetic 
field in which further splitting of fine spectral lines was observed. The 
elliptical orbits can only take up certain orientations in the presence of 
the strong external magnetic field rather than precessing freely. Each 
of these orientations are associated with the third quantum number ‘m’, 
which can possess l, (l – 1), … 0 … (–l + 1), –l values. This is how the 
single line splits into (2l + 1) number of lines under the force of strong 
magnetic field.
rrr2.1 REASONS FOR THE FAILURE OF CLASSICAL MODEL 
OF ATOM OR BOHR MODEL OF ATOM
The results of Bohr model can be used to explain the motion of macroscopic 
objects or big objects (like orbiting planets and sun, falling stone etc.). These 
macroscopic objects have essentially a particle nature and Newtonian laws of 
motion can be applied on them. But it fails when applied to explain the motion 
of microscopic objects or small objects (like electrons, atoms, molecules etc.). 
This is because:
 1. According to Bohr model, an orbit is a well-defined path and this path can 
completely be defined only if both the position and velocity of the electron 
are known exactly at the same time. But this is not possible according to 
the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Thus, Bohr model contradicts the 
Heisenberg’s	uncertainty	principle.
 2. According to Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged particle 
moving in well-defined circular orbits concentric about the nucleus. The 
wave character of the electron is not considered. Thus, Bohr model ignores 
the de-Broglie dual nature of matter.
2.2 DEVELOPMENTS LEADING TO QUANTUM
MECHANICAL MODEL OF ATOM
In view of the shortcomings of Bohr model of atom, efforts were made to 
develop a new model of atom which could overcome the limitations of Bohr 
model. The development of the new model was mainly based on the following 
two concepts that had been put forward:
Towards Quantum Mechanics
246 Chapter 2 Towards Quantum Mechanics
 1. de-Broglie concept of dual nature of matter.
 2. Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
2.3 de-Broglie’s DUAL NATURE OF MATTER
In 1905, Einstein suggested that radiation has dual nature, i.e. wave nature 
as well as particle nature. Later in 1924, a French physicist, Louis-Victor de￾Broglie gave theory of wave particle duality of matter. He suggested that just 
as radiation possesses both wave and particle nature, all macroscopic as well 
as microscopic material objects (like electron, proton, atom, molecule, a piece 
of chalk, a piece of stone etc.) also possess dual nature i.e., wave and particle 
nature. The wave associated with a material particle is called matter waves or 
de-Broglie waves.
• de-Broglie equation: He calculated the wavelength of the wave associated 
with a material particle of mass (m) moving with a velocity (v). The de￾Broglie relationship is
 λ = 
h
mv
 = 
h
p
 where, p = momentum of the particle
 λ = de-Broglie wavelength.
 h = Planck’s constant.
• Derivation of de-Broglie relationship: Consider a photon of light having 
energy E. If photon is assumed to have particle nature, its energy is given 
by Planck’s quantum theory as
E = hv …(2.1)
If photon is assumed to have wave nature, its energy is given by Einstein 
equation as
 E = mc2
 …(2.2)
 where, h = Planck’s constant
 c = velocity of light (3 × 108
 ms–1)
 v = frequency of the wave
 m = mass of photon
 Equating equations (2.1) and (2.2)
 hv = mc2
 Now, v = 
c
λ
hc
λ
 = mc
2
 λ = 
h
mc2.3 de-Broglie’s Dual Nature of Matter 47
This equation is applicable to any material particle. This is done by replacing 
the mass of the photon by mass of the material particle and the velocity ‘c’ of 
the photon by velocity ‘v’ of the material particle. Thus, for any material particle 
like electron, proton etc., we have
 λ = 
h
mv
 or λ = 
h
p
 (de-Broglie equation)
Thus, from de-Broglie equation, we conclude that, λ ∝ 
1
p
i.e., de-Broglie 
wavelength of wave associated with material particle is inversely proportional 
to its momentum. Therefore, de-Broglie equation relates the particle character 
with wave character of material particles.
Electromagnetic waves Matter	waves/de-Broglie	waves
1. When electrically charged particles 
move under acceleration, alternating 
electric and magnetic fields are 
produced which are perpendicular to 
each other. These fields are produced 
and transmitted in the form of 
electromagnetic waves.
1. These waves are not associated with 
electric and magnetic fields.
2. They can pass through vacuum. 2. They cannot pass through vacuum i.e.,
they require medium for propagation.
3. They travel with the speed of light. 3. They do not travel with the same 
speed as that of light.
4. The wavelength of the electromagnetic 
wave is given by λ = 
c
ν
.
4. The wavelength of the de-Broglie 
wave is given by λ = 
h
mv
.
5. They are emitted from a particular 
source in the form of radiation.
5. They are not emitted from a source 
but attached to a moving particle.
• Significance	of	de-Broglie	equation:	According to de-Broglie, every 
moving object whether macroscopic or microscopic have a wave 
character. The wavelength associated with ordinary macroscopic objects 
(like running car, cricket ball etc.) are so small (because of their large 
masses) that their wave properties cannot be detected i.e., wavelength 
associated with large objects is not significant. Whereas, the wavelength 
associated with microscopic objects, (like electrons and other subatomic 
particles) is large enough (because of their small masses) and thus can 
be detected experimentally.
Since in everyday life, we come across macroscopic objects, therefore 
de-Broglie relationship has no significance in everyday life.48 Chapter 2 Towards Quantum Mechanics
• Derivation of Bohr’s postulate of angular momentum from de-Broglie 
equation: de-Broglie applied his theory of wave particle duality to the 
Bohr model to explain why only certain orbits are allowed for the electron. 
He argued that only certain orbits allow the electron to satisfy both its 
particle and wave properties at the same time because only certain orbits 
have a circumference (2πr) that is an integral multiple of the wavelength 
(nλ) of the electron.
In other words, according to de-Broglie concept, electron is not only a 
particle moving in a circular path but is instead a standing wave* (no 
energy radiating motion) extending around the nucleus in the circular 
path. In order that the wave may be completely in phase (Fig. 2.1), 
the circumference of the orbit must be equal to an integral multiple of 
wavelength (λ).
i.e. 2πr = nλ …(2.3)
where, r is the radius of orbit and, n is an integer

*Stationary or Standing Waves: If a string is stretched between two fixed 
points, then a wave is allowed to travel along the string in one direction 
such that when the wave reaches the other end, it is reflected in the opposite 
direction with the same wavelength, speed and amplitude. The string is also 
divided into a number of vibrating segments, separated by points of zero 
amplitude. Such a vibrating motion is called a stationary or a standing 
wave. The points of zero amplitude (points a) are called nodes.2.3 de-Broglie’s Dual Nature of Matter 49

•	 Experimental	 verification	 of	 wave	 nature	 of	 electrons:	 In 1927,
C.J. Davisson and Germer gave experimental verification for the 
revolutionary postulate given by de-Broglie. It was further verified by 
G.P. Thomson.
 1. C.J. Davisson and Germer’s Experiment: In 1927, Davisson and Germer 
observed that when a beam of electrons (or neutron, or proton or hydorgen 
atoms etc.) is allowed to fall on the surface of nickel crystal and the reflected 
rays are received on a photographic plate, a diffraction pattern (consisting 
of a number of concentric rings) is obtained (Fig. 2.3). The diffraction rings 
formed by the electrons were similar to those formed by X-rays.

 Since, X-rays are electromagnetic waves i.e., they have wave character, 
therefore, electrons must also have wave character.
 Further, the wavelength determined from the diffraction pattern is in good 
agreement with those calculated from de-Broglie equation.50 Chapter 2 Towards Quantum Mechanics
 2. Thomson’s Experiment: In 1928, G.P. Thomson observed that when an 
electron beam is allowed to fall on a thin foil of gold in place of nickel 
crystal and reflected rays are received on a photographic plate, a diffraction 
pattern (consisting of a number of concentric rings) is obtained (Fig. 2.4).
 This again confirmed the wave nature of electrons.

• Thus, de-Broglie’s prediction was confirmed experimentally when it 
was found that an electron beam undergoes diffraction, a phenomena 
characteristic of waves. This is used in making an electron microscope
(used to measure the size of objects) which is based on the wave like 
behaviour of electrons just as an ordinary microscope utilises the wave 
nature of light.
• Experimental verification of particle nature of electrons: The particle 
nature of electron can be justified on the basis of following observations.
 1. When an electron strikes a screen coated with zinc sulphide, a spot of 
light known as scintillation is produced. One electron produce only 
one scintillation. Since a scintillation is localised on the screen, thus the 
striking electron which produces scintillation must also be localised. This 
suggests that electron possess particle character because localised character 
is possessed by the particles. Hence, electron has the particle nature.
 2. The particle nature of electron can also be shown by J.J. Thomson’s 
experiment used for the determination of charge to mass ratio of electron 
and Milliken oil drop Experiment used for the determination of charge 
on electron.2.3 de-Broglie’s Dual Nature of Matter 51
 Thus, we conclude that everything (light and matter) in nature have the 
properties of both particle as well as wave. In other words, dual character 
is applicable to everything.

2.4 HEISENBERG’S UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE
Werner Heisenberg stated uncertainty principle which is the consequence of 
dual nature of matter and radiation.
All moving objects that we see in daily life i.e., macroscopic objects (like 
moving car, ball thrown in air etc.) have definite paths or trajectories along which 
they move. The definite trajectories indicates that their position and velocity can 
be measured accurately at any moment of time. But, such accurate measurements 
of position and velocity cannot be done for sub-atomic particles i.e. microscopic 
objects (like electron, proton, atom etc.). There are always some uncertainties 2.4 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle 53
in measurement of position and velocity for small moving particles. Thus, for 
such subatomic particles, the existence of definite paths or trajectories is ruled 
out. Thus in microscopic world, it is found that however refined our instrument 
there is a fundamental limitation to the accuracy with which the position and 
velocity of microscopic particle can be known simultaneously.
In 1927, a German physicist, Werner Heisenberg gave a principle about 
the uncertainties in simultaneous measurements of position and momentum 
of subatomic particles, which is known as Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. 
This principle states that: It is impossible to determine simultaneously the 
exact position and momentum (or velocity) of small moving particles with 
accuracy or certainty. If one quantity is known then the determination of 
the other quantity will become impossible
Mathematically,
 Dx · Dpx
≥
h
4π
 (2.4)
 Dx · mDvx
≥
h
4π
where, Dx = uncertainty in position
Dpx
 = uncertainty in momentum in x-direction
Dvx
 = uncertainty in in velocity in x-direction
m = mass of the particle
h = Planck’s constant
Also, Dx ∝
1
∆vx
This implies that the position and velocity of a particle cannot be determined 
simultaneously with accuracy. If the position of the particle is known with high 
degree of accuracy (Dx is small), then velocity of particle will be uncertain (Dvx
is large) and vice versa.
The uncertainty principle also applies for the same axis of position and 
momentum. Like if Dx is along the y-axis, then Dp must also be along the y-axis.
Uncertainty in Time and Energy: Similar to uncertainty in position there 
is another principle uncertainty which limits the accuracy in the measurement of 
time i.e., if DE is the energy uncertainty in time Dt then we have an expression 
similar to equation (2.4).
DE × Dt ≥ h/4π ...(2.5) 
• Justification of Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: To understand this 
principle, let us first know how the position of an object is determined. 
A light phenomena is used. When a beam of visible light falls on an 
object, the photons of light gets scattered at the object and the reflected 54 Chapter 2 Towards Quantum Mechanics
photons enter the retina of our eyes which produces the sensation of 
sight. If the object is of sufficient size, its position and velocity will not 
be changed by the energy of the photons of light falling on it. As such it 
will be possible to know both the position and the velocity of the object 
at the same time.
But in case of microscopic objects (such as an electron), an entirely 
different situation exists due to very small size of the particle to be located. 
According to principle of optics, the accuracy with which the position of 
a particle can be located depends upon the wavelength (λ) of light used 
and the position cannot be located more accurately than ± λ. Therefore, 
due to the very small size of the electron its position can be determined 
with sufficient accuracy only by choosing light of very small wavelength. 
But shorter wavelength of light means that its photons would possess 
higher energy. When such a high energy photon falls on the electron, part 
of the energy of the photon falls on the electron and part of the energy of 
the photon would be transferred to the electron. As a result, the electron 
would undergo considerable change in its velocity (therefore, momentum) 
[Fig. 2.5]. Thus we find that if a photon of smaller wavelength is used 
there will be large inaccuracy in the determination of momentum of the 
electron. On the other hand, if a photon of larger wavelength is used, 
there will be large uncertainty in the location of its position.

• Significance	of	Heisenberg	Uncertainty	Principle:	
 1. Although Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle holds good for all the objects 
but its effect is significant only for motion of microscopic objects and is 
negligible for that of macroscopic objects. Since in everyday life, we deal 
with macroscopic objects, thus Heisenberg uncertainty principle has no 
significance in everyday life.
 The reason why the uncertainty principle is of no importance in our daily 
life is that planck’s constant ‘h’ is so small (6.625 × 10–34 joule-seconds) 
that the uncertainties in position and momentum of even quiet small 2.4 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle 55
(not microscopic objects) objects are far too small to be experimentally 
observed. For microscopic phenomena such as atomic processes, the 
displacements and momentum are such that the uncertainty relation is 
critically applicable.
 2. It rules out the existence of definite path or trajectories of small microscopic 
particles. This is because position and velocity of a moving particle fix 
its trajectory. Since for microscopic object, it is impossible to determine 
simultaneously the position and velocity at any given instant with accuracy. 
Thus, it is not possible to talk of the trajectory of the small moving 
microscopic particles.
 3. The principle describes the incompleteness of Bohr’s atomic theory. This is 
the reason that Bohr’s concept of fixed circular path with definite position 
and momentum of the electron (subatomic particle) have been replaced by 
stating that the electron has the probability of having a given position and 
momentum. This latter on, forms the basis of quantum or wave mechanical 
model of atom.

, which implies that the position and velocity of a particle 
cannot be determined simultaneously with accuracy. If the position of the 
particle is known with high degree of accuracy (Dx is small), then velocity 
of particle will be uncertain (Dvx
is large) and vice versa.

rrr3.1 NECESSITY OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
In the 17th century, it was thought that motion of macroscopic and microscopic 
objects could be well-expressed by using the laws of classical mechanics. But 
towards the end of 19th century, experimental studies showed that classical 
mechanics failed when applied to microscopic objects. This was mainly because 
classical mechanics did not take into account the concept of de-Broglie’s 
dual nature of matter and Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Also, classical 
mechanics does not put any restrictions on the values of dynamical properties 
(likes position, momentum, energy etc.) calculated for microscopic object. 
According to classical mechanics, microscopic objects can have any value of 
dynamical properties, (exact, large or small is permissible). Also any number
of properties can be calculated simultaneously for a system.
However, experimental measurements for microscopic objects show that 
there exists a well-defined set of energy levels. Like, an electron moving around 
the nucleus of an atom have a discrete set of energy levels known as quantised 
energy levels. So to understand such behaviour of microscopic objects, it was 
necessary to postulate a new system of mechanics called Quantum mechanics. 
Quantum mechanics deals with the study of motion of matter at microscopic 
level. It is a new branch of science which takes into account the dual nature 
of matter.
According to classical mechanics, it is possible to write down equations 
which tells exact values of position and momentum of a system at any time. The 
state of a given system (containing a number of particles) can be completely 
explained by knowing the position and momentum of every particle in the system 
Introduction to 
Quantum Mechanics
360 Chapter 3 Introduction to Quantum Mechanics
at any particular time. Whereas, the state of a given system (containing a number 
of particles) in quantum mechanics is not given merely by its position and 
momentum but by something called “wavefunction”. By knowing the state of a 
system i.e., wavefunction, does not enable to predict the results of measurements 
with certainty, but rather gives a set of probabilities for the possible outcomes 
of any measurement. Thus, the word exactness in classical mechanics has 
been replaced by the word probability in quantum mechanics.
When quantum mechanics is applied to macroscopic objects, the results are 
the same as those from the classical mechanics.
3.2 SCHRODINGER WAVE EQUATION
The two important principles laid the foundation of quantum mechanics, the 
de-Broglie dual nature of matter and Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Quantum 
mechanics, developed by Erwin Schrodinger in 1926, is based on the wave 
motion associated with the small moving objects i.e., microscopic objects.
For the wave motion of the electron in the three dimensional space around 
the nucleus, Schrodinger put forward an equation, known after his name as 
Schrodinger wave equation, which is considered as the heart of quantum 
mechanics. This equation takes into account the dual nature of matter and is 
given as:

The solution of Schrodinger wave equation for an electron give the values 
of E and ψ. The values of E represent the possible values of energy which the 
electron in the atom can occupy. The corresponding values of ψ are called 
wavefunctions. The wavefunction corresponding to an energy state contains all 
the information about an electron which is present in that state.3.3 Derivation of Time Independent Schrodinger Wave Equation 61

3.3 DERIVATION OF TIME INDEPENDENT SCHRODINGER 
WAVE EQUATION
Schrodinger equation was proposed by the 
Austrian phyicist Erwin Schrodinger in 1926.
Schrodinger developed a mathematical 
wave equation to describe the wave motion of 
the electron in a atom. He considered that the 
nucleus is surrounded by a vibrating electron 
wave which may be mathematically compared 
with stationary or standing wave formed by 
a vibrating string fixed between two points 
as shown in Fig. 3.1. The electron in an atom is under constraint imposed by 
the attraction of the nucleus. Therefore, there must be a wave equation which 
describe the wave motion of electron analogous to that used to describe a 
“standing or stationary” wave system (wave appearing in stretched string) whose 
solution in one dimension is given by the sine wave equation (3.1)
ψ = A sin 2π

The wavefunction ψ in the Schrodinger wave equation is the amplitude of the 
electron wave or amplitude of vibration at any point surrounding the nucleus. The 
wavefunction for an electron in an atom has no physical significance by itself. It 
can neither be measured nor be observed. It has only mathematical significance. 
It is a mathematical function whose value depends upon the coordinates of the 
electron in an atom, ψ(x, y, z). A complete description of the state of the system 
can be described by wavefunction ψ.
In the classical theory of light or sound, the square of the amplitude of the 
wave at any point gives the intensity of the sound or light at that point. Similarly, 
very similar concept was suggested by Max Born in quantum mechanics, 
according to which the square of the amplitude of the electron wave i.e., ψ2
 at 
any point gives the intensity of the electron wave at that point. Thus, ψ2
 at any 
point gives the probability of finding the electron.3.4 Physical Significance of Wavefunction (ψ) and Probability Density (ψ2) 65
According to Max Born, a German physicit, probability concept of the 
uncertainty principle should be utilized to get an idea of distribution of the 
electron in the atom in terms of the wavefunction ψ. When the amplitude of 
the wave is large, the probability of the event is large and when the amplitude 
is small, the probability of the event is small. But the wavefunction itself cannot 
represent probability because probability of finding an electron at a given point 
in space is always real and positive. Whereas, wavefunction, ψ may be positive, 
negative and in some cases a complex quantity i.e., contains imaginary number 
( ) i = −1 . Thus, the square of wavefunction i.e., ψ2
 is proposed. By taking square 
of the wavefunction (ψ2 = ψ · ψ*), the imaginary or negative value vanishes
(Q, ψ* is conjugate of ψ). Thus, the ψ2 obtained has a real and positive value.
If ψ has imaginary value, then it can be expressed as
 ψ = a + ib
where a and b are real numbers and i (known as iota) = −1 . In such a case, 
ψ is made real by multiplying it by its own complex conjugate (ψ*) which 
is expressed as
ψ* = a – ib
The product obtained by multiplying ψ with ψ* is
 ψψ = (a + ib)(a – ib) = a
2
 – (i
2b
2
) 
 = a
2
 – (–1 × b
2
) ( ) Q i i = −1 and = 1 2
 = a
2
 + b
2
However, if ψ is real, then ψ = ψ*, then ψψ* = ψ2
.
The square of the wavefunction ψ2
 has physical significance and it represents 
intensity. Greater the intensity of wavefunction at a particular point, greater 
is the probability of locating the electron at that point. Thus, ψ2
 is interpreted 
being proportional to electron density. When ψ2
 is high, electron density is high, 
that is, the probability of finding an electron is high. If ψ2
 is low, probability 
of finding an electron is low.
If ψ extends over a finite volume in space dx · dy · dz (= dτ), then the electron 
would be found in that volume. Thus, the probability of finding electron in the 
small volume element dx · dy · dz (= dτ) situated at a point in space is given as:
Probability density (ψ2
) = ψψ* dx dy dz = ψψ* dτ = ψψ* dV .
The probability of finding the electron is finite which means ψψ*dτ must 
have real value.66 Chapter 3 Introduction to Quantum Mechanics
3.5 CONCEPT OF ATOMIC ORBITAL
Taking into consideration the wave nature of electron and the concept of 
probability, the movement of the electron around the nucleus is like that of bee 
around the hive. Sometimes, it may come close to the nucleus and sometimes 
it may move away from it. Further, it does not move in one plane (as wrongly 
postulated by Bohr) but moves in all directions and in all planes around 
the nucleus. Thus, in the light of uncertainty principle, Bohr model of atom 
postulating that electrons move along definite circular paths and hence their 
position and momentum could be determined with absolute accuracy became 
unacceptable. Now, we speak in terms of ‘probability’ of finding the electron 
at any particular position about the nucleus at any instant of time.
The region of space around the nucleus which describes the probability 
of	finding	an	electron	of	given	energy	is	called	an	electron cloud.
Also the probability of finding an electron is never zero. Even at large 
distance from the nucleus, there is a finite, though small, probability of finding 
an electron of a given energy. This means that electron clouds do not have sharp 
boundaries (Fig. 3.2).
Fig. 3.2. Electron cloud for the only electron of the hydrogen atom.
However, for the sake of pictorial clarity and for convenience of 
representation, a boundary surface (Fig. 3.3) may be drawn which connects 
points of equal probability and encloses a certain volume of the space around 
nucleus within which the probability of finding an electron of given energy is 
maximum (say upto 90%). This is called atomic orbital.
Thus, atomic	orbital	may	be	defined	as	 the	three dimensional space 
around the nucleus	within	which	the	probability	of	finding	an	electron	of	
given energy is maximum (say upto 90%).3.5 Concept of Atomic Orbital 67
Fig. 3.3. Boundary surface for maximum probability density.
By finding ψ2
 at different points around the nucleus in an atom, we can 
predict the region of space around the nucleus within which the probability of 
finding the electron with a definite value of energy is maximum. This space 
around the nucleus which represents the electron density at different points is 
called an atomic orbital. That is why, the wavefunction for an electron in an 
atom is called orbital wavefunction or atomic orbital.
Orbit Orbital
1. An orbit (proposed by Bohr) is a 
circular path around the nucleus in 
which an electron moves.
1. An orbital is a quantum mechanical 
concept and it refers to the three 
dimensional space around the nucleus 
within which the probability of finding 
an electron is maximum (upto 90%).
2. It represents the planar motion of 
electron around the nucleus.
2. It represents the three dimensional 
motion of an electron around the 
nucleus.
3. The concept of orbit is not in accordance 
with the wave nature of electrons and 
uncertainty principle. Thus, a precise 
description of this path of the electron 
is impossible according to Heisenberg 
uncertainty principle.
3. The concept of an orbital is in 
accordance with the wave character of 
electrons and uncertainty principle.
4. Bohr orbits have no real meaning 
and their existence can never be 
demonstrated experimentally.
4. It is a quantum mechanical concept and 
refers to the one electron wavefunction 
ψ in an atom. The value of ψ depends 
on the coordinates of the electron. Also, 
ψ itself has no physical significance but 
ψ2
 has a physical significance.
5. The maximum number of electrons in 
an orbit is given by 2n
2
, where, n is the 
number of the orbit.
5. The maximum number of electrons 
present in any orbital is two.68 Chapter 3 Introduction to Quantum Mechanics
3.6 QUANTUM MECHANICAL MODEL OF ATOM
Just as Bohr model of atom was developed on the basis of classical mechanics, 
the quantum mechanical model of atom has been developed on the basis of 
quantum mechanics i.e., Schrodinger wave equation. This quantum mechanical 
model of atom takes into account the two concepts i.e., de-Broglie dual nature 
of matter and Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Thus, quantum mechanical 
model takes wave nature of electron into consideration. The Bohr concept of 
fixed circular path with definite position and momentum of the electron have 
been replaced in quantum mechanical model by stating that the electron has the 
probability of having a given position and momentum. According to this model, 
an electron does not move in one plane but moves in all directions and in all 
planes around the nucleus. There is a finite, though small, probability of finding 
an electron of a given energy around the nucleus. The probability of finding 
an electron is never zero. The electrons in an atom have only quantised values 
of energy. These quantised values of energy are obtained from the solution of 
Schrodinger wave equation. The corresponding values of the wavefunction ψ are 
also obtained from the solution of Schrodinger wave equation. This wavefunction 
ψ is simply a function of coordinates of the electron and has no physical 
significance as such. However, ψ2
 gives the probability of finding the electron 
at that point i.e., electron density at that point. The concept of probability is 
justified in view of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. By finding ψ2
 at different 
points around the nucleus in an atom, we can predict the region of space around 
the nucleus within which the probability of finding the electron with a definite 
value of energy is maximum. This space around the nucleus is called orbital. 
This wavefunction ψ is called orbital wavefunction or atomic orbital. Since 
an electron can have many wavefunctions, therefore, there are many atomic 
orbitals in an atom. The wavefunction ψ contains all the information about an 
electron in an atom.
3.7 EIGEN VALUE AND EIGEN WAVEFUNCTION
Schrodinger wave equation is a second order differential equation. When it 
is solved, it gives infinite solutions of ψ represented as ψ1
, ψ2
, ψ3
, … etc. 
with corresponding energies E1
, E2
, E3
, … etc. But all the solutions are not 
acceptable. Only those values of ψ are acceptable which correspond to some 
definite values of the total energy E. The acceptable values of the wavefunction 
ψ are called eigen wavefunction or acceptable wavefunction. The value of 
E given by a particular eigen wavefunction is called eigen value or proper 
value or characteristic value. Thus, every value of wavefunction is not an 
eigen wavefunction.3.7 Eigen Value and Eigen Wavefunction 69
The properties of an eigen function are: S, C, F, B, N
 1. ψ must be single valued (S) 
 ψ must be single valued at any given point.
 Like: 
1
2
3
4
( )x
x
A
 Four values are permitted at a point A, thus here ψ(x) is not single valued.
 2. ψ must be continuous (C)
 ψ must vary smoothly without breaks i.e., there should not be any gap 
or discontinuity in the function.
 Like: sine and cosine plots are continuous however tan plot is not 
continuous.
 3. ψ must have finite	value	(F)
 ψ must have finite values and it should not possess any imaginary values 
Like: iota (i = −1 ) values.
 4. ψ must be bounded in the space (B)
 ψ must have boundary conditions in the space.
 5. ψ must be normalised (N)
 ψ being normalised means that the probability of finding the particle 
inside the bounded space is unity (i.e., sure success in probability).
ψ ψ* dτ
−∞
+∞ ∫
 = 1
 The function which possess all the above properties is called well 
behaved wavefunction or acceptable wavefunction.70 Chapter 3 Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

 2. What are the properties of an acceptable wavefunction?
or
 What are conditions that ψ must obey as a wavefunction?
or
 What are the conditions under which a wavefunction is said to be a well 
behaved one?3.8 Normalised, Orthogonal and Orthonormal Wavefunction 71
 Ans. Properties or Conditions of a wavefunction to be acceptable are:
 S = Single valued, ψ must be single valued at any given point
 C = Continuous, ψ must vary smoothly without breaks
 F = Finite, ψ must have finite values (imaginary values not allowed)
 B = Boundary conditions, ψ must be bounded in the space 
 N = Normalised i.e., probability of finding the particle in the bounded 
space must be equal to unity.
 3. What is the significance of ψ and ψ2
.
 Ans. The wavefunction ψ in the Schrodinger equation is the amplitude 
of the electron wave. It has no physical significance by itself but has only 
mathematical significance. It is a mathematical function whose value 
depends upon the coordinates of the electron in an atom. The wavefunction 
can be positive, negative or a complex quantity.
 Whereas, the square of the wavefunction ψ2
i.e., square of the amplitude 
of the electron wave, at any point give the intensity of electron wave at 
that point. It gives the probability of finding the electron at a given point 
in space. The ψ2
 have always real and positive values.
 4. Explain as to why ‘ψ’ should be finite, single valued and continuous. 
Ans. When Schrodinger equation is solved, it gives infinite solutions of 
ψ with corresoponding energies. But all the solutions are not acceptable. 
Only those values of ψ are acceptable which fulfills certain properties like 
it must be finite, single valued and continuous.
3.8 NORMALISED, ORTHOGONAL AND ORTHONORMAL 
WAVEFUNCTION
 1. Normalised Wavefunction: 
• The square of wavefunction (ψψ*) is proportional rather than equal 
to the probability of finding the electron in a given volume element 
dx · dy · dz (= dτ or = dV). For most of the purposes, it is taken as equal 
to the probability which implies that the electron is in a given volume 
element dτ. In such a case, the integration of ψψ* dτ over whole of the 
configuration space, which gives the total probability in a given volume 
element must be equal to unity
ψψ* dτ
−∞
+∞ ∫
 = 1 or ψ τ 2
d
−∞
+∞ ∫
 = 1
 The wavefunction which satisfies the above relation is said to be normalised.
• But very often, ψ is not normalised. Thus, ψ is multiplied by a constant 
N to give a new wavefunction, Nψ, which is also a solution of the wave 72 Chapter 3 Introduction to Quantum Mechanics
equation. The value of N used to make the new wavefunction a normalised 
wavefunction can be calculated as follows:
( ) N N ψ ψ ( )* dτ

N d 2 ψψ* τ





/
The factor N thus introduced is called Normalisation Constant and 
is independent of the coordinates (x, y, z). The function Nψ is called 
Normalised Wavefunction.
• The solution of Schrodinger equation may provide more than one 
wavefunction i.e., each wavefunction satisfies the Schrodinger equation 
with its own characteristic eigen value. If ψi
and ψj
are the two different 
eigen or acceptable wavefunction of a given system, then these functions 
will be normalised if they meet the requirement
−∞
+∞ ∫
ψ ψ τ i i* d = 1 and 
−∞
+∞ ∫
ψ ψj j* = 1.
 2. Orthogonal Wavefunction:
 Let ψi
 and ψj are the two independent eigen wavefunctions obtained on 
solving the Schrodinger equation of a given system and each wavefunction 
satisfies the Schrodinger equation with its own characteristic eigen values. 
If two such wavefunctions satisfy the expression
−∞
+∞ ∫
ψ ψ τ i j d = 0
 then the two functions are said to be orthogonal to each other. Orthogonality 
implies the independence of energy states.
3. Orthonormal Wavefunction: (Orthonormal = Normalised + Orthogonal)

The symbol δij is called Kronecker’s delta.3.8 Normalised, Orthogonal and Orthonormal Wavefunction 73
Problems based on normalised and orthogonal Wavefunction
Q.1. How do you justify the normalisation condition.
 Ans. The square of the wavefunction ψ2
 accounts for the probability of 
the particle in the bounded space.
 The probability equal to unity (ψ2
 = 1) means that finding the particle inside 
the bounded space is sure (i.e., complete success case in probability).
 The conjugate of wavefunction is multiplied by the wavefunction while 
squaring it, in order to absorb imaginary parts.
 ψ*ψ = ψ2
 = 1
 Normalisation condition applies with the application of boundary 
conditions.
ψ ψ* dτ

 The above condition is the condition of normalisation.
 Q.2. Perform the normalisation of the given wavefunction, ψ = x2

on solving the Schrodinger equation of a given system. If two such 
wavefunctions satisfy the expression

3.9 OPERATORS
An operator is a symbol for a mathematical calculation/procedure/command 
which changes one function into another.
Operator (Function) = New Function
An operator written alone has no significance. The left hand side of the 
above equation does not mean that the function is multiplied with the operator. 
The function on which the operation is carried out is called an operand.3.9 Operators 77

An operator is used with the symbol (

) over it i.e. a CARAT is put over 
the symbol of the operator. Thus, P operator is represented as Pˆ and Q operator 
is represented as Qˆ .
• algebra of Operators
 1. Addition and Subtraction of Operators: If Aˆ and Bˆ are two different 
operators and f(x) is the function, then
ˆ ˆ
( ) () A Bfx +
 = 
ˆ ˆ Af x Bf x () () +
ˆ ˆ
( ) () A Bfx − = ˆ ˆ Af x Bf x () () +
 2. Multiplication of Operators: If Aˆ
 and Bˆ are two different operators 
and f(x) is the function, then order of the operation is very important. 
ˆ ˆ AB f x [ ( )] = ˆ ˆ A Bf x [ ( )] = ˆAf x [ ( )] ′ = f ″(x)
(where Bˆ f (x) = f ′(x))
 This above expression implies that first operator Bˆ operates on function 
f(x) to get the result, say f ′(x) and then operator Aˆ
 operates on function 
f ′(x) to get the final result say f ″(x).
 When we are dealing with operators, the order of operation should be 
maintained. Usually the order of operation is from RHS to LHS.
 Like: Aˆ
 = x, Bˆ
 = 
d

it is shown by a power of operator.

 3. Commutative Property: If two operators are such that the result of their 
successive applications is the same irrespective of the order of operations, 
then the two operators are said to be commutative.
 If, ˆ ˆ ABf x [( )] = ˆ ˆ BAf x [( )] , then the two operators Aˆ
 and Bˆ
 commute with 
each other i.e. the normal product of two operators is equal to their product 
in reverse order.
 The expression ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ [ ] AB BA − is called commutator and is represented as 
ˆ ˆ
[ ] A B⋅ .
 Commutator = ˆ ˆ
[ ] A B⋅ = ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ AB f x BA f x [ ( )] [ ( )] − .
 If the two operators commute with one another, then the value of 
commutator is zero i.e.
ˆ ˆ
[ ] A B⋅ = 
ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ AB f x BA f x [ ( )] [ ( )] − = 0
 Like: Aˆ

 Thus, Aˆ
 and Bˆ
 commute with each other because value of commutator 
is zero.
 On the other hand, the two operators are said to be non-commutative if 
ˆ ˆ AB f x [ ( )] ≠ ˆ ˆ BA f x [ ( )]. Also if the two operators do not commute with 
one another, then the commutator has some value i.e., non-zero.
 Commutator = ˆ ˆ
[ ] A B⋅ = ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ AB f x BA f x [ ( )] [ ( )] − ≠ 0
 Like: Aˆ

• Significance	of	Commutation:	If the two operators commute i.e.,
ˆ ˆ
[·] A B = ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ AB f x BA f x [ ( )] [ ( )] − = 0
then, the two observable properties represented by operators Aˆ
 and Bˆ
can be simultaneously and exactly determined. However, if the operators 
do not commute i.e.
ˆ ˆ
[·] A B = ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ AB f x BA f x [ ( )] [ ( )] − ≠ 0
then, the two observable properties represented by operators Aˆ
 and Bˆ
cannot be simultaneously and exactly determined.
• Eigen function, Eigen value and Eigen value equation: If an operator 
Aˆ
 operates on a well behaved function f(x), and give the same function 
multiplied by a constant. Then the function f(x) is called the eigen 
function and the constant is called the eigen value of the operator. The 
equation formed is called as Eigen value equation i.e., eq. (3.10).

 Proof: Let Â be a Hermitian operator, ψ its eigen function and ‘a’ the 
eigen value.
Âψ = aψ …(3.19)
and (Âψ)* = a*ψ* …(3.20)
 Multiply eq. (3.19) by ψ* and on integration 
ˆ ψ ψτ *( ) A d ∫

ψ ψ *(a d) τ
ˆ ψ ψτ *( ) A d ∫

ψ ψ ( *a d *) τ
ˆ ψψ τ ( )* A d ∫

 LHS of eq. (3.21) and eq. (3.22) is equal, since Â is Hermitian,
i.e. ˆ ψ ψτ *( ) A d ∫
 = ˆ ψψ τ ( )* A d ∫
 Therefore, RHS of eq. (3.21) and eq. (3.22) is also equal 
i.e. a d ∫
ψ ψ* τ = a d * * ∫
ψψ τ
Therefore, a = a*
 i.e. a is real.3.9 Operators 85
 (ii)	Eigen Functions of	 a	Hermitian Operator Corresponding	to
Different Eigen Values are Orthogonal: Let ψ1
 and ψ2 are two eigen 
functions of a Hermitian operator Â corresponding to two eigen values

 respectively.
 The condition of orthogonality is 
∫
ψ ψ τ 1 2 d = 0
or ∫
ψ ψ τ 1 2* d = 0
or ∫
ψ ψ τ 1 2 * d = 0.
 Proof: The eigen value equations are
 Âψ1 = a1ψ1

2 1 * ˆ ψψτ ( ) A d ∫

 Since Â is Hermitian, LHS of eq. (3.25) becomes

ˆ ψψ τ ( )* A d ∫
 = ∫
ψ ψ τ 1 2 2

 However, if a1

4. What are operators? Give their significance in quantum mechanics.
 Ans. An operator is a symbol for mathematical procedure which changes 
one function into another
Operator (function) = New function.
 Significance	of	Operators	in	Quantum	Mechanics:	According to third 
postulate of quantum mechanics, for every observable in quantum mechanics 
(like position, velocity, momentum, energy etc.), there corresponds a 88 Chapter 3 Introduction to Quantum Mechanics
mathematical operator in quantum mechanics. The physical properties 
of the observable can be infered from the mathematical properties of its 
associated operator. [Refer postulate III of quantum mechanics]

2. Define linear operators. Give an example.
 Ans. By linear operator, we mean if it is applied on the sum of two functions, 
the result is equal to the sum of the operations on the two functions 
separately
Â[f + g] = Âf + Âg

9. Show that if two operators Â and Bˆ
 commute, they have same set of eigen 
functions.
 Ans. Let ψA
 be the eigen function of Â operator, with an eigen value ‘a’.
Then, ÂψA
 = aψA …(1)
Given ABˆ ˆ
 = BAˆ ˆ
 (Â and Bˆ commute).
 Multiply both the sides by ψA
ABˆ ˆ ψA
 = ˆ ˆ BAψA
ˆ ˆ A B( ) ψA = ˆ ˆ B A( ) ψA
ˆ ˆ
( ) A BψA
 = Bˆ (aψA
) [using (1)]
ˆ ˆ A B( ) ψA = ˆ a B( ) ψA
 This means ˆ
( ) BψA
 is also an eigen function of Â operator with the eigen 
value ‘a’, which is possible only if BˆψA
 is just a multiple of ψ i.e., BˆψA
= C · ψA
, or ψA
 is also an eigen function of Bˆ
.

 Since the value of commutator is zero, thus the two operators commute 
with each other.96 Chapter 3 Introduction to Quantum Mechanics
12. What do you understand by the commutation between two operators? What 
is the importance of this concept?
(or)
 What important aspect is signified by the property of commutation?
 Ans. If two operators are such that the result of their successive applications 
is the same irrespective of the order of operations, then the two operators 
are said to be commutative
 i.e., 
ˆ ˆ AB f x( ) = ˆ ˆ BA f x( )
 Commutator = ˆ ˆ
[ ] A B⋅ = ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ [ ] () AB BA f − x .
 If the two operators commute with one another then the value of commutator 
is zero.
 Importance of Commutation: A physical quantity (like; energy, 
momentum, position etc.,) of a system can be represented in quantum 
mechanics by operator. If two operators commute, then it is possible to 
determine accurately both the corresponding quantities simultaneously.
 13. Evaluate the commutator ˆ ˆ [ ] L L x y ⋅ where, ˆLx

 But,

15. There exists a set of orthogonal functions, ψ which are simultaneously 
eigen function of both the operators Â and Bˆ
. Prove that Â and Bˆ must 
commute for this statement to be true. 
Ans. Since ψ is the eigen function of both the operators ˆ ˆ A B and . Let ‘a’ 
and ‘b’ are the respective eigen values
then, Âψ = aψ …(1)
Bˆψ = aψ …(2)
Now, ABˆ ˆψ = ˆ ˆ A B( ) ψ
 = Â(bψ) (Using 2)
 = b(Âψ) 
ABˆ ˆψ = b(aψ) (Using 1) …(3)3.9 Operators 99
Similarly, ABˆ ˆψ = ˆ ˆ B A( ) ψ
 = ˆB a( ) ψ (Using 1)
 = ˆ a B( ) ψ 
BAˆ ˆψ = abψ (Using 2) …(3)
From eqs. (3) and (4)
ABˆ ˆψ = BAˆ ˆψ
 Therefore, the two operators ˆ ˆ A B and commute with each other.

(Âφ) dτ = φ

(Âψ)* dτ
 Then the operator Â is called Hermitian operator. Hermitian operators give 
real values.
Like: Linear momentum and kinetic energy operators are Hermitian operators.
4. Show that “Hermitian operators” have real eigen values. What is the 
significance of this property?
 Ans. Let Â be a Hermitian operator, ψ its eigen function and ‘a’ the eigen 
value; then,
Âψ = aψ …(1)
 and (Âψ)* = a*ψ* …(2)
 Multiply eq. (1) by ψ* and on integration.
ψ* ∫
(Âψ)dτ = ψ ψ *(a d) τ
∫
ψ* ∫
(Âψ)dτ = a d ψ ψ* τ
∫ …(3)
 Multiply eq. (2) by ψ and on integration
ψ∫
(Âψ)*dτ = ψ ψ ( * a d *) τ
∫
ψ∫
(Âψ)*dτ = a d * * ψψ τ
∫
 …(4)
 LHS of eq. (3) and eq. (4) is equal, since Â is Hermitian.
 i.e., ψ* ∫ (Â ψ) dτ = ψ∫
(Âψ)*dτ
 Therefore, RHS of eq. (3) and eq. (4) is also equal
 i.e., a d ψ ψ* τ
∫ = a d * * ψψ τ
∫
a = a* i.e., a is real.
Significance: The real values can be applied to real systems in the universe. 
Imaginary values can only be applied to hypothetical system.
5. Show that if two operators Â and Bˆ
 are Hermitian, their product ABˆ ˆ
 is 
also Hermitian, if and only if operators Â and Bˆ
 commute.
 Ans. Since ABˆ ˆ

thus, ψ* ∫

 Therefore, ˆ ˆ

 6. Derive the condition for the eigen functions of Hermitian operators to be 
orthogonal.
 Ans. Let ψ1
 and ψ2
 be two eigen functions of a Hermitian operator Â 
corresponding to two eigen values a1
 and a2
 respectively. The condition 
of orthogonality is
ψ ψ τ 1 2 d ∫
 = 0
 or ψ ψ τ 1 2 * d ∫
 = 0
 or ψ ψ τ 1 2 * d ∫

 Proof: The eigen value equations are:

3.10 POSTULATES OF QUANTUM MECHANICS
Quantum mechanics is based on few principles or postulates.
 1. Postulate I: Wavefunction or state function is an important property 
in quantum mechanics. To every state of a physical system, there is 
a function ψ		which	defines	the	state	of	the	system. Knowledge of this 
function permits a complete description of the state of the system.
• The wavefunction ψ (r, t) depends on the space co-ordinates of the 
particles, r = (x1
, y
1
z
1
, x
2
, y
2
, z
2
...) and on time, t. Suppose there is a 
dynamic system with ‘n’ particles (1, 2, 3, ...n) and their space co-ordinates 
are (x
1
, y1
, z
1
), (x2
, y2
, z
2
) etc. Then the state of these particles can be 
explained by a wavefunction, ψ .
 ψ (r, t) = ψ (x
1
, y
1
, z
1
, x
2
, y
2
, z
2
, …, x
n
, y
n
, z
n
, t).
 Generally, the wavefunction is a complex function, which means we have 
to do with its complex conjugate ψ *, as well, obtained by changing the 
imaginary number i = −1 into –i, [Basically, this imaginary number, ‘i’, 
is not present in classical mechanics but is an inherent property which is 
present in quantum mechanics].
 Thus, we calculate
ψ ψ ( ,rt rt ) · * ( , )dτ
−∞
+∞ ∫
 = ψ τ 2
d
−∞
+∞ ∫
 By doing this, the imaginary number ‘i’ vanishes. This ψ2
 is the probability 
of finding the particle in a particular volume element dτ = dx1
, dy1
, dz1
, 
dx2
, dy2
, dz2
, ..., located at distance r and time, t.
• If the wavefunction depends on time, t, then called time dependent 
wavefunction, ψ (r, t). But, if it is independent of time, t, then called 
time independent wavefunction, ψ(r).
ψ( ,r t) = ψ(r) · φ(t).
ψ(x, y, z, t) = ψ(x, y, z) · φ(t)
• Actually, when we speak about evolution, the time dependent 
wavefunction, ψ (r, t) is taken into account. But when we speak about 
the state of a physical system, then time independent wavefunction, ψ(r) 
is taken into account.3.10 Postulates of Quantum Mechanics 113
• Thus, according to this postulate, state of a physical system is described 
by wavefunction ψ and all the information about a state is contained 
inside ψ. It is actually the store house of information.
 2. Postulate II: The function ψ	must	be	single	valued,	finite,	smoothly	
varying and continuous between the boundaries at which it vanishes, but 
at the boundary the wavefunction has to vanish. Thus, ψ vanishes at infinity
i.e., probability of finding the particle at infinity is zero. The function which
possess all these properties is a well behaved wavefunction.
Dynamic variable: It is any property of the system. Like energy, position, 
velocity, momentum etc.
Observable: It is that property which can be experimentally observed.
Usually, dynamic variable is an observable. But spin component and angle 
‘x’ are dynamic variable and not observable.
 3. Postulate III: For every observable of a system in classical mechanics, 
(like position, velocity, momentum, energy etc.) there corresponds a 
mathematical operator in quantum mechanics. The form of the operator 
can be obtained from the classical expressions for the observables according 
to the definite rules. The physical properties of the observable can be infered
from the mathematical properties of its associated operator.

In quantum mechanics we deal with Linear Hermitian operators.
[Refer sec. 3.9: Operators]
 A Linear operator Â has the property i.e., eq. (3.17)
Â[f + g] = Â(f) + Â(g)
 A Hermitian operator Â has the property i.e., eq. (3.18)
ˆ *( ) A d
+∞
−∞
ψ φτ ∫
 = ˆ
( )* A d
+∞
−∞
φψ τ ∫
 The Hermitian property of the operator ensures that the value of any 
observable obtained will be real.
 4. Postulate IV: For any measurement of the observable associated 
with the operator Â, the only value that will ever be observed is the 
eigen value ‘a’ which can be obtained from eigen value equation, i.e., 
eq. (3.10).
 Âψ = aψ
 An eigen value is just a real number and when an observable has a definite 
value, the value of the observable is the eigen value.
 An eigen value equation is that equation in which an operator Â when 
operates upon the wavefunction ψ, it gives a constant called eigen value ‘a’ 
and wavefunction ψ back. While the eigen function and the operator may 
be real or complex, but the eigen value must be real because it represents 
observable physical quantities.
 Moreover, quantum mechanical operators of interest (like; momentum, 
energy etc.) are Hermitian operators which have real eigen values. The 
Hermitian property of the operator ensures that value of any observable 
obtained will be real.
 5. Postulate V: If ψ is an eigen function of operator Â, then Âψ = aψ. But, it 
has to be noted that ψ is not necessarily an eigen function of Â. When ψ is 
not an eigen function of Â, then we talk of average values in quantum 
mechanics.3.11 Derivation of Time Independent Schrodinger... 115

 where, Ĥ is the Hamiltonian operator. Ĥ is a function of position co-ordinates

 Since this is a partial differential equation involving both position and 
time variables, it can be solved only by separating it into two differential 
equations, one containing position variables and other containing time 
variables only. This can be done if we assume that
ψ (x, y, z, t) = ψ(x, y, z) · φ(t) …(3.31)

 Suppose there is a system whose potential energy, V depends only on 
position co-ordinates and independent on time ‘t’. Since potential energy, 
V is independent of time ‘t’, therefore, Ĥ is also independent of time. This 
is because Ĥ = T V ˆ ˆ + .

are at rest. It is stationary in the sense that the probability density, ψ2
 and every 
physical property of the system (like; energy, charge density, dipole moment 
etc.) will be independent of time.

4.1 APPLICATION OF POSTULATES OF QUANTUM 
MECHANICS TO SIMPLE SYSTEM
All the properties and motion of a particle of mass ‘m’ which moves with 
potential energy, V(x, y, z) can be obtained from solution of well behaved 
Schrodinger equation

∇ + 

2
2m
ψ ψ V x( , y z, ) = Eψ
If we look at this equation, system depends on mass ‘m’ and potential 
energy, ‘V’ of the particle. So one system differ from another system on the 
basis of mass and potential energy. Thus, we find the solution of this Schrodinger 
equation for different systems by varying the mass and potential energy of the 
system.
We can find the exact solution to this Schrodinger equation only for 
very simple system. In case of complex system, the exact solution cannot be 
determined and if it is determined, the answer is so elaborate that it is difficult to 
understand. So most of the complex systems are solved by using approximation 
method.
4.2 OPERATION OF QUANTUM MECHANICS 
It involves four steps:
 1. Writing the Schrodinger Equation: 
Hˆψ = Eψ
ˆ ˆ ( ) T V+ ψ = Eψ122 Chapter 4 Particle in a Box: Quantisation of Translational Energy
 According to quantum mechanics, microscopic particles in an enclosure 
is never at rest and hence kinetic energy ˆ
( ) T is never equal to zero but 
potential energy ˆ
( ) V can be zero.
 Thus, first we need to define potential energy of the system and then 
Hamiltonian ˆ
( ) H is written for the system. Also we need to define 
wavefunction (ψ) for the system. Wavefunction is always system specific 
and is also called store house of the information of the system.
 Total number of terms in the Hamiltonian:
 Total energy = K.E + P.E
 where,
 Number of K.E. terms = Number of particles in the system
(each particle has its own K.E. term)

 2. Specifying Boundary Conditions: The restriction imposed on the

the wavefunction, we satisfy the necessary condition of a wavefunction to 
be acceptable. In other words, ψ value obtained must satisfy the boundary 
conditions, if it does not satisfy then that ψ is not accepted.
 3. Solving the Schrodinger Equation to get ψ and E Values: Once 
Schrodinger equation is obtained with boundary conditions, then we solve 
for the general solution of the wavefunction and energy.
 4. Calculation of Properties Using Wavefunction: Properties like 
momentum, position etc. for a system can be solved using:
 (a) Eigen Value Equation: This gives exact solution of the property, i.e., 
eigen value, using mathematical relation
Aˆψ = aψ
where, Â = operator of the property
 a = eigen value of the property which should be 
 a constant value.
 (b) Mean Value Theorem: Some systems do not give constant value for 
the eigen value i.e. they cannot give exact solution for the property. In 
that case, average value of the property is calculated using mean value 
theorem

4.3 INTRODUCTION TO TRANSLATIONAL MOTION OF
A PARTICLE
The most simple type of motion that a particle (atom or molecule) can undergo 
is translational or linear motion. In general, translational motion is the kinetic 
motion of a particle. However, an atom or molecule can execute translational, 
rotational, vibrational and electronic motions, but in free state they move 
linearly only.
In this chapter we deal with the linear motion of a particle under quantum 
mechanical bound state (i.e., boundary conditions) and under free state
(i.e., without boundary conditions).124 Chapter 4 Particle in a Box: Quantisation of Translational Energy
4.4 PARTICLE IN ONE DIMENSIONAL BOX: QUANTISATION 
OF TRANSLATIONAL ENERGY
• This is the simplest application of Schrödinger wave equation to the 
translational motion of a particle (atom or molecule) in space. According 
to classical mechanics, energy of a moving particle can vary continuously 
i.e., can have any value. But the quantum mechanical results obtained 
from the solution of Schrödinger wave equation for the translational 
motion of a particle in space, we can explain that, why the energies are 
quantised i.e., can have only discrete values.
• “Particle in a box” model serves as the simplest case for the treatment 
of bound electrons in atoms and molecules. It is a hypothetical case, in 
which we assume that a single particle of mass ‘m’ is restricted to move 
in an imaginary one dimensional box of length ‘a’ with infinitely high
walls at the two ends. Thus, the boundary conditions are defined by
x = 0 to x = a.
As long as particle is inside the box we assume potential energy, V = 0, 
which implies that particle is free to move inside the box, (i.e., the particle is 
not under any external force and its potential does not vary inside the box). In 
order that the particle may remain inside the box, and does not move outside the 
boundary conditions, it is essential to assume that the potential energy outside the 
walls is very high i.e., equals to infinity, so that as soon as the particle reaches 
the wall, it is reflected back into the box due to high potential difference. Thus, 
particle is just confined to move in a box of length ‘a’. This model is also called 
particle in a potential well (Fig. 4.1).

particle cannot exist.126 Chapter 4 Particle in a Box: Quantisation of Translational Energy

 This is a second order differential equation. To solve this, we have to 
first find out the general solution of wavefunction, ψ and the nature of 
solution is such that if the wavefunction is differentiated twice, then 
we must get back the function multiplied by a constant.
 Let the general solution of this differential equation is given by

where, K

 A and B are arbitrary constants.
 Depending upon the values of A, B and K, ψ can have many values. But 
all the values are not acceptable. Only those values of ψ are acceptable 
(i.e., are eigen functions) which satisfy the boundary conditions. Thus, 
apply the boundary conditions on the general solution of ψ. Also, this 
ψ should be continuous and the value of ψ = 0 outside and at the walls 
of the container. viz
 x = 0, ψ = 0 Boundary
 x = a, ψ = 0 conditions on the wall4.4 Particle in One Dimensional Box: Quantisation of Translational Energy 127
 Imposing boundary condition on general solution of ψ:
1. When x = 0, ψ = 0
 ψ = A sin Kx + B cos Kx
 0 = A sin 0 + B cos 0
 0 = A B ( ) 0 1 + ( ) [ sin 0 = 0 and cos 0 = 1]
 B = 0
\ ψ = A sin Kx
2. When x = a, ψ = 0
 ψ = A sin Kx + B cos Kx
 0 = A K sin ( a K + 0 cos ) a [ B = 0]
 A sin Ka = 0
 Here, A ≠ 0 because if both A and B become zero, ψ will be zero at all 
values of x. This equation holds good only when sin Ka = 0 which is 
possible only when the value of Ka are integral multiplies of π i.e.
 sin Ka = 0
 sin Ka = sin nπ

Thus, equations (4.1) and (4.2) are the solutions of the Schrodinger wave 
equation for a particle moving in one-dimensional box.
4.4.2 Conclusions from the Study of a Particle in One￾Dimensional Box
 1. Quantisation of Energy: According to classical mechanics, energy of a 
moving particle can vary continuously i.e., can have any value. But from the 
solution of Schrodinger wave equation of a particle in space, we can explain 
as to why the energies are quantised i.e., can have only discrete values. 
The expression for the energy obtained from the solution of Schrodinger 
equation of one dimensional box is given as
 E = 
n h
ma
2 2
2
8
 In this expression, since ‘n’ can have any integral values equal to 1, 2, 3 
etc., (n ≠ 0) therefore energy E associated with the motion of a particle in 
a box can have only discrete value. 
 Thus, it is concluded that whenever a particle is confined to move in a 
limited space, its energy is quantised.130 Chapter 4 Particle in a Box: Quantisation of Translational Energy
 2. When n = 0, Violation of Heisenberg uncertainty Principle: 
(a) If n = 0, then the exact position of a particle is defined, which violates the 
Heisenberg uncertanity principle. According to Heisenberg uncertainty 
principle for microscopic particles, exact position and momentum 
cannot be determined at the same time.
 (b) Also, microscopic particle cannot be at rest according to postulates of 
quantum mechanics.
(c) If n = 0, then E = 0 and ψ = 0
 E =

 and ψ =

 which is not acceptable because store house of information, ψ, cannot 
be zero for a system.
 3. Existence of Zero Point Energy: The zero point energy of a particle in a 
box is the lowest energy of a particle in a box. The minimum value that n
can possess is 1, therefore, the energy corresponding to n = 1 will be the 
zero point energy (E1
)
 E1
 = 
h
ma
2
2
8
 (n = 1)
 Thus, the lowest value of E is not zero but h
 2
/8ma2
 (when n = 1). This 
shows that particle is not a rest even at absolute zero or at zero kelvin. Thus 
the particle in a box will continue to move to and fro in the region ‘0’ to 
‘a’ even at the temperature of absolute zero. Also, if particle is not at rest, 
the position cannot be determined precisely and hence momentum is not 
given precisely. Thus, the occurrence of zero point energy is in accordance 
with uncertainty principle.

 These straight horizontal lines shows that energy (E) of the particle is the 
same irrespective of the position (x) of the particle. In other words, for a 
particular value of n, the energy (E) does not change with x. Since E (or Ĥ) 4.4 Particle in One Dimensional Box: Quantisation of Translational Energy 131

is independent of time (t), the system under consideration is a good and 
simple example of “conservative system”. (conservative system is the one 
whose mass does not change with time).

 As the quantum number (n) increases, the spacing between the energy 
levels also increases as shown in Fig. 4.3. The separation between the 
energy levels not only depends on ‘n’ but also on the length (a) of the box 
and mass (m) of the particle. It is important to note that, for a particular 132 Chapter 4 Particle in a Box: Quantisation of Translational Energy
value of n, energy (E) is inversely related to mass (m) of the particle and 
length (a) of the box. Greater the mass of the particle and length of the 
box, value of a discrete energy level becomes smaller and the difference 
between energy levels decreases, thus energy levels move closer to one 
another.
 If the length of the box becomes very large, quantisation disappears and 
there is a smooth transition from quantum behaviour to classical behaviour. 
In the limiting case of a → ∞ (free particle) the quantisation vanishes.
 Similarly, if the mass (m) of the particle becomes large which means that 
for macroscopic objects (large m), the levels are closely spaced and there 
is no quantisation.
6. The wavefunction for a particle in one dimensional box is given by
 ψn
 = 
2
a
n x
a
sin  π





 The values of wavefunction corresponding to n = 1, 2, 3, … etc., are given 
by
 n = 1, ψ1

 n = 3, ψ3

 and so on.
 Thus, no other wavefunctions are possible between these wavefunctions. 
Such discrete wavefunctions are called eigen wavefunction or acceptable 
wavefunction or well behaved wavefunction.
 7. Forms of the Wavefunction: The situation of a particle confined to move 
in a one dimensional box of length ‘a’ is similar to that involving vibration 
of a string which is fixed at x = 0 and x = a. As ‘n’ increases, energy (E) 
increases, wavelength (λ) decreases and the wave oscillate more rapidly.
 If we plot a graph of wavefunction ψn
 verses x (Fig. 4.4) for different values 
of n, we found that ψn
 can be either positive or negative. The graphical 
representation of ψn
are exactly like those showing the displacements of 
a vibrating string clamped at x = 0 and x = a.4.4 Particle in One Dimensional Box: Quantisation of Translational Energy 133

 Whereas, if we plot a graph of probability density ψn

 Vs x [Fig. 4.5] for 
different values of n, we found that ψn

 is positive everywhere. This indicates 
that probability of finding the particle at any point is always positive

 From this graph we conclude that the probability of finding the particle 
in a box is “delocalised” within the ends of the box, but it has maximum 
probability at certain specified points depending on the energy state. For
n = 1, the maximum probability occurs at x = a/2; for n = 2, the probability 
at x = a/2 is zero, while it is maximum at x = a/4 and x = 3a/4 i.e., on either 
side of the middle point.
 The above graphs [Fig. 4.4 and Fig. 4.5] show that 
Energy level

for any value of n is (n – 1)

and so on
 Node is the point at which probability of finding the particle is zero. 134 Chapter 4 Particle in a Box: Quantisation of Translational Energy
 In other words, it is the point inside the box where ψ2 = 0 (or ψ = 0). It 
is the general property of wavefunction, that greater the number of nodes 
in a wavefunction, more is the curvature in the particle wave. Thus, for a 
box of fixed size, as the number of nodes increases, the curvature in the 
wavefunction increases, the wavelength (distance between two nodes) of
the particle wave decreases and the kinetic energy of the particle increases.
8. Symmetry of the wavefunction: The wavefunction ψ belongs to one of 
the two classes:
 (i) symmetric wavefunction
 (ii) antisymmetric wavefunction
Quantitatively, the function is symmetric, when n is odd, e.g., ψ1
, ψ3
, ψ5
, 
… which satisfy the condition ψ(x) = –ψ(x).
 The function is antisymmetric, when n is even, e.g., ψ2
, ψ4
, ψ6
, … which 
satisfy the condition ψ(x) = –ψ(–x).
 Qualitatively, the symmetry of the function can be shown by imagining a 
vertical mirror placed exactly at the mid-point of the box (shown by dotted 
vertical line in Fig. 4.6)

mirror
Fig. 4.6. One dimensional box with symmetric and antisymmetric wavefunction.
 The wavefunction can be seen to be symmetrical with respect to reflection 
in this mirror when n is odd (i.e., left half is the mirror image of the right 
half) while they are antisymmetrical when n is even (i.e., left half is exactly 
opposite to the right half).
9. Relation of n with λ: The wavelength λ of the wavefunction ψ, decreases 
with increase in the value of n (as shown in Fig. 4.4). Mathematically, this 
can be shown as follows:
 As n increases, the kinetic energy of the particle increases.4.4 Particle in One Dimensional Box: Quantisation of Translational Energy 135

11. Bohr Correspondence Principle: For a small quantum number (n) 
probability density is not uniform at all positions (maximum at curvature 
and reduce to minimum near the nodes). However, probability distribution 
becomes more uniform with increase in the value of n. For a very high 
quantum number, there is more or less equal probability of finding the 
particle inside the box at any point (as shown in Fig. 4.7), which is same 
as concluded by the classical mechanics.
 Thus, quantum mechanics merges with classical mechanics at very 
high value of quantum number. This is called as Bohr correspondence 
principle.

4.4.3 Solution of Properties in One Dimensional Box
Properties like position, momentum etc. for a given system can be solved using: 
 (a) Eigen Value Equation: This gives exact solution of the property i.e.,
eigen value, using mathematical relation
Aˆψ = aψ
 where,
Aˆ
 = operator of the property
 a = eigen value of the property which should be a 
constant value.
 (b) Mean Value Theorem: Some systems do not give constant value for the 
eigen value i.e., cannot give exact solution for the property. In that case, 
average value of the property is calculated using mean value theorem.
a = 〈a〉 = 
ˆ *

 where, a or 〈a〉 = average value of the property.
 If the system is normalised, then the value of denominator becomes 
unity i.e., ∫

 Thus, ψ is not an eigen function of the position operator. This does not 
satisfy eigen value equation i.e., we cannot get exact solution for position of 
the particle in one dimensional box. Hence, we apply mean value theorem 
to find the average value of position (x).4.4 Particle in One Dimensional Box: Quantisation of Translational Energy 139

 The average momentum of a particle moving in a one dimensional box 
is zero, which shows that particle in a box cannot continue to travel in 
one direction only. However exact momentum cannot be calculated.4.4 Particle in One Dimensional Box: Quantisation of Translational Energy 147
Since, a moving particle cannot have zero momentum, therefore, it means 
that particle possess equal momentum in opposite directions, which cancel 
each other on taking the average.

 4. Calculate the expectation value of energy for a particle in a one dimensional 
box.
 Ans. Total energy (E) for a particle in a one dimensional box is 
 E = T + V
 when particle is moving inside the box, its potential energy (V) is zero.
Thus E = T or Ĥ = Tˆ .
 For a particle in one-dimensional box, moving only in x-direction and limits
in x-direction are from x = 0 to x = a.

11. What are symmetric and anti symmetric functions?
 Ans. The wavefunction belongs to one of the two classes:
 (i) symmetric wavefunction
 (ii) antisymmetric wavefunction 
 The function is symmetric, if it satisfies the condition 
 ψ(–x) = ψ(x)
 The function is antisymmetric, if it satisfies the condition
 ψ(–x) = –ψ(x).
 12. What do you understand by orthonormal set of wavefunctions? Explain 
this by taking the wavefunction of a particle in a one dimensional box of 
length ‘a’ (Given that V = 0 for 0 ≤ x ≤ a and V = ∞ elsewhere).

 Therefore, the wavefunction ψ1

 13. Why is n = 0 not permitted in the equation En

?
 Ans. For particle in a one dimensional box,
ψ =

n x
a
sin  π





 and E = 
n h

. 
 (i) If n = 0, then ψ = 0 or E = 0. But it is not at all acceptable for a particle 
moving in a box. Because for n = 0, ψ = 0 and ψ cannot be equal to 
zero inside the box. Since the particle is existing inside the box and if 
ψ = 0, then we are violating what we are saying.
 (ii) If n = 0, ψ = 0, E = 0 and if energy which is the kinetic energy
( Potential energy is assumed to be zero), becomes zero it means 
momentum is zero Q K.E. =
p
m
x









. However, zero momentum means 
Dpx
 = 0 which is the violation of Heisenberg’s principle.
 14. Zero point energy need not be equal to zero which Comment.
Ans. Zero point energy of a particle in a box is the lowest energy of a particle 
in a box. The minimum value of n is 1, therefore, the energy corresponding 
to n = 1 will be the zero point energy (E1
) and E1
= h
2
/8ma2
.
 The lowest value of E is not zero but h
2
/8ma2
. This shows that particle 
is not at rest even at absolute zero or at zero kelvin. Thus, the particle in 
a box will continue to move to and fro in the region ‘0’ to ‘a’ even at the 
temperature of absolute zero.
 15. Write an energy expression for a particle of mass ‘m’ confined to move in 
a one-dimensional box of length ‘a’. Calculate the energy required for a

Ans. The electron inside the one-dimensional box is never at rest. We cannot 
find the exact position and exact momentum using eigen value equation, 
however, their average values are calculated using mean value theorem. 
[Refer section 4.4.3]. This means for the electron (microscopic particle), 
the position and momentum are changing very fast to be calculated. This 
is in accordance to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

problem is not an eigen function of the linear momentum operator.

4.4.4 Application of Particle in a One-dimensional Box
“Particle in a box” model provides satisfactory interpretation of electronic 
spectra (UV or visible) of conjugated organic molecules like linear conjugated 
polyene molecule. The experimental spectral data available for these molecules 
agree fairly well with the values calculated using “particle in a box” model.
A linear conjugated polyene molecule may be regarded as one-dimensional 
box and π electrons of molecule as a particle. The π electrons move from one 
end of the conjugated chain to the other end just as particle in a box continue to 
move in a to and fro motion within the box. Although there are more than one 
π electron moving in a box, but the coloumbic repulsion among the π electrons 
is neglected and each electron is supposed to move freely (i.e., V = 0). The 
π electrons occupies the various energy levels in accordance with the rules of 
electronic distribution in atoms and molecules. The energies of π electrons in 
various energy levels is calculated by the expression of energy, En
 = n
2h
2
/8ma2
.
Also, the length (a) of the box is taken equal to the sum of all the C—C 
bond distances of the molecule.
An electron in an atom or molecule can jump from a lower energy level to 
a higher energy by absorption of appropriate wavelength of light, or it can jump 
from a higher to a lower level by emission of light. The wavelength (λ) of the 
light absorbed or emitted is related to the energy gap between the two levels.
 DE = 
hc
λ
This energy gap further depends on the mass and the length of the molecules 
i.e., length of the conjugated chain. If the chain length of the molecule is small, 
hence the mass is less (like butadine), then the energy gap would be large and 
the absorption takes place in ultraviolet region (lower λ). While, if the chain 
length of the molecule is large, hence the mass is large, then the energy gap 
would be small and the absorption takes place in visible region (higher λ). These 
above observations can be explained by using the expressions of “particle in 
a box” model.
Let the energy gap (DE) between highest occupied molecular orbital (n) 
and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (n + 1) is:

Example: If we take a specific case of butadiene molecule and treat the 
π-electrons of this conjugated system as particles moving in a one-dimensional 
box. Then the ground state energy, hence, the lowest absorption frequency and 
the wavelength of absorbed light for the butadiene molecule can be calculated 
as follows:
There are 4π electrons in butadiene molecule: CH CH—C 2 2 H CH

4.5 PARTICLE IN TWO-DIMENSIONAL BOX
Particle in a one-dimensional box serve as the simplest case for the treatment of 
bound electrons in atoms and molecules. Thus, it is a very convenient model for 
several types of atomic and molecular systems. The calculated values for various 
observables for this system are approximate but they agree fairly well with the 
experimental results. Here we will discuss the quantum mechanical treatment 
of a single particle moving in a two dimensional box. We have two cases:
Case I : Particle moving in two dimensional rectangular box (a ≠ b)
Case II : Particle moving in two dimensional square box (a = b).
4.5.1 Two Dimensional Rectangular Box
Suppose there is a particle moving in a two dimensional box whose dimensions 
are a and b along the two coordinates x and y. 172 Chapter 4 Particle in a Box: Quantisation of Translational Energy

 The only solution possible for Schrodinger equation when particle is 
outside the box is ψ = 0. This proves that outside the box, ψ = 0, which 
implies that the particle cannot exist outside the box i.e., when 0 ≤ x ≤ a, 
particle cannot exist.4.5 Particle in Two-dimensional Box 173

 This eq. (4.3) is the Schrödinger wave equation for a particle moving 
in two-dimensional box which has to be solved. It is partial differential 
equation where the wavefunction ψ is a function of x and y. This two 
dimensional equation can be reduced to two ordinary one-dimensional 
equation by making use of technique of separation of variables. In 
this technique, we made an assumption that ψ is a product of two 
independent functions.

 Different wavefunctions corresponding to same energy value are called 
degenerate states and the energy value is called degenerate level. The 
phenomena is called degeneracy. Number of states having same energy 
derived from different wavefunction define degree of degeneracy. 
 In this case, the second energy level is doubly degenerate i.e., it has 
two fold degeneracy because of two states having same energy value 
for different wavefunctions.

 2. The degeneracy is due to the symmetry of the square (a = b). If this 
symmetry is destroyed (a ≠ b), then degeneracy would not occur. Thus, 
we study the concept of degeneracy in case of two dimensional square 
box, but not in two dimensional rectangular box.

4.6 PARTICLE IN THREE DIMENSIONAL BOX
Particle in a one-dimensional box serve as the simplest case for the treatment of 
bound electrons in atoms and molecules. Thus, it is a very convenient model for 
several types of atomic and molecular systems. The calculated values for various 
observables for this system are approximate but they agree fairly well with the 
experimental results. Here we will discuss the quantum mechanical treatment 
of a single particle moving in a three dimensional box. We have two cases:
Case I : Particle moving in three dimensional cuboidal box (a ≠ b ≠ c)
Case II : Particle moving in three dimensional cubical box (a = b = c).4.6 Particle in Three dimensional Box 181
4.6.1 Three Dimensional Cuboidal Box
Suppose there is a particle moving in a three-dimensional box whose dimensions 
are a, b and c along the three coordinates x, y and z. 
To calculate energy for particle in a three dimensional box, we have to 
first write the Hamiltonian (Ĥ) part and thus the general Schrodinger equation 
would be:

 The only solution possible for Schrödinger equation when particle is 
outside the box is ψ = 0. This proves that outside the box, ψ = 0, which 
implies that the particle cannot exist outside the box. i.e. when 0 ≤ x ≤ a, 
particle cannot exist.

 This eq. (4.6) is the Schrödinger wave equation for a particle moving in
three dimensional box which has to be solved. It is a partial differential 
equation where the wavefunction ψ is a function of x, y and z. This three 
dimensional equation can be reduced to three ordinary one-dimensional 
equation by making use of technique of separation of variables. In 
this technique, we made an assumption that ψ is a product of three 
independent functions.

 Different wavefunctions corresponding to same energy value are called 
degenerate states and the energy value is called degenerate level. The 
phenomena is called degeneracy. Number of states having same energy 
derived from different wavefunction define degree of degeneracy. 
 In this case, the second energy level is triply degenerate i.e. it has three 
fold degeneracy because of three states having same energy value for 
different wavefunctions.

 Thus, it is concluded, that in a cubical box, when
1. nx
 = n
y 
= nz
 ; there is no degeneracy
 nx
 = n
y 
≠ nz 
; there is three fold degeneracy
 nx
≠ n
y 
≠ nz 
; there is six fold degeneracy.
 2. The degeneracy is due to the symmetry of the cube (a = b = c). If this 
symmetry is destroyed (a ≠ b ≠ c), then degeneracy would not occur.
 Thus, we study the concept of degeneracy in case of three dimensional 
cubical box, but not in three dimensional cuboidal box.

4.7 FREE PARTICLE
Free particle (unbound particle) is the one which is not subjected to any external 
force or potential barrier and is free to move in limitless space. This means 
particle is not in a region where its potential energy (V) varies with position and 
thus its potential energy is constant, which for convenience, may be assumed 
to be zero (V = 0) everywhere.

Since the particle is in the free state i.e., it is free to move everywhere in 
space, no boundary conditions can be applied to such system and the solution 
lies by the method of separation of variables.

4.7.2 Quantisation of Energy Levels: Difference Between 
Particle in Free State and Under Bound State

Since DE is inversely proportional to a
2
, thus as the value of ‘a’ increases the 
value of DE decreases. The value of discrete energy level becomes smaller and 
the difference between energy levels decreases, thus energy levels move close 
together. If the length of the box ‘a’ becomes infinite, quantisation disappears 
and there is a smooth transition from quantum behaviour to classical behaviour. 
Thus, in the limiting case i.e. a → ∞ (free particle) the quantisation vanishes. 
Therefore, we conclude that, 
 Particle in bound state → quantisation occurs
 Particle in free state → quantisation vanishes.
Problems based on “free Particle”
1. What important aspect is signified for an atomic model with a particle in 
free space and under bound state?
 Ans. Particle in a free space does not have quantised energy levels. However 
under bound state particle possess quantised energy levels.
(Refer sec. 4.7.2)
2. A particle in a one dimensional box moves under a constant potential in 
a space that has no boundaries. Will energy be quantised in such a case? 
Explain.
 Ans. A particle in a one dimensional box moving under constant potential 
with no boundaries is a free particle. The energy of such a system will 
not be quantised but will have continuous set of energy levels. Since

rrr5.1 INTRODUCTION
Rigid rotator is the simplest case of a diatomic molecule with a rigid bond length 
i.e., whose bond length does not change during rotation. It is an important system 
as its study makes us understand the rotational spectra of diatomic molecules 
in spectroscopy. 
5.2 CLASSICAL TREATMENT OF RIGID ROTATOR
We consider a diatomic molecule which consists of two atoms of mass ‘m1
’ and 
‘m2
’ connected through a rigid bond of length ‘r’ (equal to the distance between 
the two atoms of the molecule). Assume that the centre of mass of the system 
is fixed at point O.
Let the distance of m1
 from point O (point 
of centre of mass) be r
1
 and distance of m2
 from 
point O be r
2
. Let this rigid rotator be rotated 
around an axis perpendicular to its own axis 
and passing through point O. The interatomic 
distance does not change during rotation i.e., 
bond length is fixed.
For a microscopic diatomic system, we 
consider reduced mass (m) instead of total mass 
M or individual masses m1
 and m2
.
 Total mass = M = m1
 + m2
 The reduced mass is given by the expression

5.2.1 Kinetic Energy of Rigid Rotator
A rigid rotator rotating around a fixed axis (axis of centre of mass) has a rotational 
frequency, vrot, and its velocity, vrot is given as
Rotational velocity = Distance travelled in a rotation × Rotational frequency
vrot = 2πr × v
rot
vrot = r(2πvrot)
vrot = rw …(5.1)
where, w = 2πv
rot = angular velocity.
Let v1
 and v2
 be the respective rotational velocities of the two atoms with 
which they are rotating around the axis. The kinetic energy of the rotator is

For rotating models all the linear properties get converted to angular 
properties.
Linear properties Angular properties
Linear momentum (p) Angular momentum (L)
Linear velocity (v) Angular velocity (w)
Mass (M) Moment of inertia (I)
Therefore, the classical kinetic energy expression for linear systems 
[eq. (5.4)] can be written for rotating models (i.e., in terms of angular 
momentum) as:

where, L = Iw = angular momentum.
Thus, according to classical mechanics, the kinetic energy of the rotator can 
have any value. However, quantum mechanically, it was proved that energy of 
rigid rotator is quantised and thus cannot posses any value.5.3 Quantum Mechanical Treatment: SchrÖdinger Wave Equation for Rigid Rotator 201
5.3 QUANTUM MECHANICAL TREATMENT: SCHRÖDINGER 
WAVE EQUATION FOR RIGID ROTATOR
The rigid rotator can be solved for energy using Schrodinger wave equation. 
The Schrodinger equation for rigid rotator can be derived by two ways:
(i) One in which of kinetic energy angular momentum operator is reduced 
in polar coordinates to obtain rigid rotator wave equation.
(ii) Other in which Laplacian of kinetic energy operator is reduced in polar 
coordinates to obtain rigid rotator wave equation.
5.3.1 Deriving Schrödinger Equation by Reducing Angular 
Momentum of Kinetic Energy Operator in Polar 
Co-ordinates
Total energy of the system is the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy 
i.e., Ĥ = T V ˆ ˆ + .
In this system, we assume potential energy equal to zero (i.e., V = 0) because 
the distance between the two atoms is fixed during the rotation. Thus, the total 
energy is solved by taking kinetic energy only.
From the kinetic energy expression (K.E. = L
2
/2I), it is seen that, kinetic 
energy depends only on the square of angular momentum (L
2
) which is in the 
numerator, since moment of inertia (I) in the denominator is specific to system 
and thus has a constant value.
We have deduced from eq. (5.5) that
 K.E. = T =

• In Fig. (5.2), one of the atom is kept at origin ‘O’ and the other in the 
three dimensional space (x, y, z) at point ‘P’ for the diatomic rigid 
rotator, held through a fixed bond length, which is the distance from 
the origin (OP) signified ‘r’. This bond length (r) does not vary and 
remain constant during rotation. However, the angular orientations are 
defined by θ and φ in polar coordinates. The angle θ with the z-axis (POZ) 
may vary from 0 to π during rotation and φ is the angle made with the 
projection on the x-axis (XOR) which varies from 0 to 2π during rotation.

(Polar coordinates)
Since the distance ‘r’ (as shown in Fig. 5.1), between the two masses of the 
rigid rotator remains constant, the derivative with respect to r will vanish in the 
kinetic energy operator of rigid rotator in terms of polar coordinates. Thus, the 
above equation for kinetic energy operator for rigid rotator, gets reduced to:

For a microscopic diatomic rigid rotator, we consider reduced mass (m) 
instead of total mass M (M = m1
 + m2
) or individual masses m1
 and m2
. Thus, 
the above kinetic energy operator for rigid rotator becomes:

For a rotator rotating freely, the potential energy (V = 0) is zero and hence 
its total energy is equal to its kinetic energy
 Ĥ = T V ˆ ˆ +
Ĥ = Tˆ
 (Q, V = 0)
Therefore, the Schrodinger equation for right rotator becomes

Fig. 5.3. Conversion of cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) to polar coordinates (r, θ, φ).
 x = r sin θ cos φ
 y = r sin θ sin φ …(1)
 z = r cos θ
• In Fig. (5.3), one of the atom is kept at origin ‘O’ and the other in the 
three dimensional space (x, y, z) at point ‘P’ for the diatomic rigid 
rotator, held through a fixed bond length, which is the distance from the 
origin (OP) signified ‘r’. This bond length (r) does not vary and remain 
constant during rotation. However, the angular orientations are defined 
by θand φ in polar coordinates. The angle θ with the z-axis (POZ) may vary 
from 0 to π during rotation and φ is the angle made with the projection 
on the x-axis (XOR) which varies from 0 to 2π during rotation.
• The transformation of cartesian coordinates to the polar coordinates 
can be performed using following expressions:

5.4 WAVEFUNCTION OF RIGID ROTATOR
We have derived the Schrodinger equation by two methods in sec. 5.3, both of 
them generating the same equation i.e., (5.7 and 5.8).

Since the distance ‘r’ between the two masses of the rotator remains constant, 
the derivative w.r.t. r will not appear in this equation. Also, the wavefunction 
of rigid rotator depends only upon the angular orientation part (θ and φ) and is 
independent of the radial part (r). Thus, the wavefunction ψ(r, θ, φ) for rigid 
rotator has been replaced by a function Y(θ, φ), known as spherical harmonics 
which depends only on the coordinates θ and φ.
 Spherical harmonics = Y(θ, φ) = Θ(θ)F(φ)

Setting both the sides of the equation equal to m2
, we get a pair of differential 
equations each in one variable θ and φ. Thus, the Schrodinger equation for rigid 
rotator can be solved by using the technique of separation of variables method.

The eq. (5.10) is Θ part of the wavefunction.
Thus for solving the Schrodinger equation, we have to first solve the F and 
Θ part of the wavefunction.230 Chapter 5 Rigid Rotator: Quantisation of Rotational Energy

The above equation is a differential equation whose solution is given as

this equation

The function F should be finite, and consistent in order to be an acceptable 
wavefunction. Also in a rigid rotator the angle φ varies from 0 to 2π (Fig. 5.2). 
Thus, for function F to be continuous, the value of F at φ should be equal to 
the value of function at (φ + 2π). Thus, when the angle φ is replaced by (φ + 
2π), the same set of points in space is obtained.
 F(φ) = F(φ + 2π)
(or) F(0) = F(2π)
Multiply both sides by ‘im’ and taking exponential, we get
 exp (im φ) = exp [im (φ + 2π)]

Also, cos 2πm + i sin 2πm = 1 (From De Moivre’s Theorem)
\ e
im(2π)
 = cos 2πm + i sin 2πm = 1
and this is possible only if m = 0, ±1, ±2, …
Hence ‘m’ is the quantum number satisfying the above values according to 
the solution. The result is same as that of magnetic quantum number of Bohr 
Sommerfield model.
In order that these wavefunctions Θ and F are finite, well behaved and 
consistent with the boundary conditions, certain quantum restrictions are 
introduced. These restrictions appear in the form of quantum number.
For the above equation to be well behaved, we need to normalise this 
function. Let ‘C’ is the normalisation constant, thus

Pl
|m|
 is the Associated Legendre polynomial of degree l and order | m |. The 
above equation has introduced another coefficient ‘l’, whose allowed values are 
0, 1, 2, 3, … . This is same as azimuthal quantum number in Bohr-Sommerfeld 
model. The above equation also impose restrictions on allowed values of m. In 
above equation a term (l – | m |)! appears, that means if | m | is allowed to be 
greater than l, the factorial of a negative number would result, which is undefined. 
Hence,	m can have values, 0, ±1, ±2, upto ±l i.e. m cannot be greater than l.
Thus the function Θ depends on the value of two quantum numbers i.e. l, 
and | m |. These solutions are obtained, provided the following conditions are 
satisfied.
 l = 0, 1, 2, 3, …
 m = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, …, ±l
m can have (2l + 1) values for a given value of l.

where, β = l(l + 1).
Thus, once again, we obtain a set of discrete energy levels and these are 
allowed energies by putting different values of l, where l = 0, 1, 2, … . Thus, 
quantum mechanically it was proved that energy of rigid rotator is quantised.
• Degeneracy: From the above expression of energy (E) of the rigid rotator, 
i.e. eq. (5.15) it is seen that energy of the rigid rotator does not depend on 
quantum number ‘m’ and depends only on quantum number ‘l’. Whereas, 
wavefunction (Y) of rigid rotator depends on l and m both. So we have 
degenerate states corresponding to different wavefunctions for a given 
level i.e. different values of m, for a given value of l.
l m = 2, = 2 l m = 2, = 1 l m = 2, = 0 l m = 2, = –1 l m = 2, = –2
l m = 1, = 1 l m = 1, = 0 l m = 1, = –1

The zero point energy of the rigid rotator is the lowest energy of the 
rigid rotator. The minimum value of l is zero, therefore the energy 
corresponding to l = 0 will be the zero point energy

Thus, for rigid rotator, zero point energy corresponds to l = 0, means no 
rotation. Also zero point energy is zero only for rotational motion but this is 
not possible for translational or vibrational motion.
i.e., Erot. zero point = 0 (corresponds to no rotation)
Evib. zero point ≠ 0
Etrans. zero point ≠ 0
According to Heisenberg uncertainty principle, kinetic energy of the system 
cannot be zero because if kinetic energy = 0, then Dx = 0, which is not possible 
for microscopic objects. But in case of rotation, kinetic energy can be zero 
without violating Heisenberg uncertainty principle because rotation does not 
change position of the complete system.
Now, ETotal = ETrans + Evib + Erot.
If Erot = 0 for l = 0, even then

Hence, Heisenberg uncertainty principle is not violated.
5.6 ROTATIONAL SPECTRA
The solution for the rigid rotator gives the complete understanding for the 
rotational spectra of a diatomic molecule. The rotational energy of a diatomic 
molecule during rotation in spectroscopy is given by:

where, B =

and J = 0, 1, 2, 3... = rotational quantum number
J is just a replacement notation for ‘l’ i.e., azimuthal quantum number in 
the solution of rigid rotator. Hence, solving for rigid rotator gives us the energy 
involved for rotational motion of a diatomic molecule.242 Chapter 5 Rigid Rotator: Quantisation of Rotational Energy

Schrodinger wave equation for rigid rotator.

 One of the atom is kept at origin ‘O’ and the other in the three 
dimensional space (x, y, z) at point ‘P’ for the diatomic rigid rotator, held 
through a fixed bond length, which is the distance from the origin (OP) 
signified ‘r’. This bond length (r) does not vary and remain constant 
during rotation. However, the angular orientations are defined by θ and 
φ in polar coordinates. The angle θ with the z-axis (POZ) may vary from 
0 to π during rotation and φ is the angle made with the projection on 
the x-axis (XOR) which varies from 0 to 2π during rotation.

 Ans. Wavefunction for a system depends on three coordinates (r, θ and

ψ(r, θ, φ) = R · (r) · Θ (θ) · F(φ).
 The wavefunction of rigid rotator depends only upon the angular 
orientation part (θ and φ) and is independent of the radial part (r). 
Thus, the wavefunction ψ(r, θ, φ) for rigid rotator has been replaced 
by a function Y(θ · φ) known as spherical harmonics.
 Spherical harmonics depends only on the coordinates θ and φ spherical

6.1 INTRODUCTION
Linear harmonic oscillator is the simplest system to understand the vibrational 
motion of microscopic particles, therefore, it is also called as simple harmonic 
oscillator. For the sake of simplicity, we treat here only the simple harmonic 
motion of a single particle which oscillates to and fro about its mean position. 
Thus, oscillations take place periodically in one dimension only, like ball of 
mass m, tied to a spring through a support shown in Fig. 6.1.

Fig. 6.1. Schematic diagram of linear harmonic oscillator.
This kind of a vibration motion obeys Hooke’s law, according to which the 
restoring force (F) acting on the particle is proportional to the displacement (x) 
from the mean position.
F ∝ x
F = –k
f
x …(6.1)
where, kf
 is called the force constant.252 Chapter 6 Linear Harmonic Oscillator: Quantisation of Vibrational Energy
It is characteristic of the spring and is a measure of the stiffness of the spring. 
A strong inflexible spring will have a larger value of k
f
 and a weaker spring will 
have a lesser value of k
f
. In chemical system, value of k
f depends on the strength 
of the bond. Also the negative sign in the above expression implies that the 
restoring force (F) always acts in the opposite direction of the displacement (x).
6.2 CLASSICAL TREATMENT OF LINEAR HARMONIC 
OSCILLATOR
In classical mechanics, the above vibrational motion can be described in terms 
of Newton’s second law of motion, according to which, we have

6.2.1. Frequency of Linear Harmonic Oscillator

its mean position can be evaluated as follows:

Linear harmonic oscillator is the simplest system to understand the vibrational 
motion of microscopic particle whose potential energy is not zero (or assumed 
zero like in case of particle in a box or rigid rotator). In linear harmonic oscillator,

Thus, the potential energy of the particle, besides depending on kf

The variation in potential energy with the displacement ‘x’ is parabolic in

Thus, total energy of the particle besides depending on kf
, depends on the 
square of the amplitude (A) of the vibration. Since the oscillating particle can 
possess any amplitude, it is obvious that the total energy of the particle will vary 256 Chapter 6 Linear Harmonic Oscillator: Quantisation of Vibrational Energy
in a continuous manner. Thus, according to classical mechanics, the energy of 
the linear harmonic oscillator can have any value.
However, quantum mechanically, it was proved that energy of linear 
harmonic oscillator is quantised and thus cannot possess any value.
• Total energy of linear harmonic oscillator is conserved:
Since the total energy of an oscillator depends only on the amplitude 
of the vibration (eq. 6.8), it is obvious that the sum of kinetic energy 
and potential energy remains the same at any instant of vibration. The 
potential energy (eq. 6.6) increases as the displacement ‘x’ is increased 
and it attains a maximum value equal to the total energy at the two 
extremes of the vibration. Consequently, the kinetic energy of the particle 
decreases as the displacement ‘x’ is increased and it has zero value at the 
two extremes of the vibration.
At equilibrium position (x = 0), the potential energy is zero and the 
particle carries only kinetic energy equal to the total energy.
 Thus, we have;
At x = 0; kinetic energy is maximum or velocity of the oscillator is maximum.
 At x = A; kinetic energy is zero or velocity of the oscillator is zero.
Since the velocity of the oscillator at x = 0 is maximum and is zero at the 
extremes of vibration, it is expected that the particle will spend maximum 
time at the extremes and the minimum at the equilibrium position during 
the course of its vibration.
6.3 QUANTUM MECHANICAL TREATMENT: SCHRÖDINGER 
WAVE EQUATION FOR LINEAR HARMONIC OSCILLATOR
The Linear Harmonic Oscillator can be solved for energy using Schrödinger 
wave equation 
Ĥψ = Eψ
In this system; total energy (E) = K.E. + P.E.
Thus, the Hamiltonian will comprise the sum of the operators for kinetic 
energy and potential energy i.e.

6.4 SOLUTION OF SCHRÖDINGER WAVE EQUATION:
VIBRATIONAL ENERGY AND WAVEFUNCTION OF THE 
LINEAR HARMONIC OSCILLATOR
In the above eq. (6.9), the potential energy term is an additional term compared 
to the Schrödinger wave equation of particle in one dimensional box. This 
additional term makes the Schrödinger wave equation of linear harmonic 
oscillator difficult to solve. Though we can solve it by either of the two methods
 1. Factorization method
 2. Power series method
Both the methods give same result for the system. However, factorization 
method is a recently developed method for solving Schrödinger wave equation 
for linear harmonic oscillator.
6.4.1. Factorization Method
In factorization method, the Schrödinger equation is converted into an 
appropriate form and then factorization method is applied to it.258 Chapter 6 Linear Harmonic Oscillator: Quantisation of Vibrational Energy

Hence, on applying aˆ

corresponds to λ [eqn. (4)]] increases by two units.

y is also called as STEP UP or CREATION

• Solving for minimum value of λ.
We assume that at ground state wavefunction ψ(y) may be written as 
v
aa y ˆ ˆ ( ) + − ψ or v
aa y ˆ ˆ ( ) − + ψ . Applying an ANNIHILATION and the 6.4 Solution of SchrÖdinger Wave Equation: 265
CREATION operator once in either order, does not bring any net change 
on the value of ψv
(y).
Since, step down by two units due to annihilation operator followed 
by step up by two units due to creation operator or vice versa does not 
bring any net change on ψv
(y).
Therefore, from equation (7) where ψv
(y) corresponds to ground state 
must have minimum value of λ we have,
min ( )

On applying annihilation operator on ground state wavefunction 
corresponding to λmin we get zero as we cannot generate a lower energy 
level than the minimum value of λ. Since, it does not exist, therefore

 λmin – 1 = 0
 λmin = 1
 So, λmin = 1 which changes always by 2 units.
\ λ = (2v + 1) …(17)
where v = 0, 1, 2, 3, …
here, v is vibrational quantum number. When v changes by one unit, 
λ changes by two units.
But, λ =

 [according to equation (4)]
 Comparing equations (17) and (4) we get

For linear harmonic oscillator, vibrational quantum number v, can 
possess zero value. Since v = 0 does not correspond to Ev

for v = 0, Ev

 hence it does not violate Heisenberg’s uncertainty 
principle in this case (unlike in particle in a box case). Therefore, v = 0 
corresponds to the zero point (Ground state) energy in case of linear 
harmonic oscillator.

Above equation gives the value of ground state wavefunction (v = 0) for 
a linear harmonic oscillator. However, the above equation is not normalised, 
so we introduce a normalisation constant in the above equation

where N0
 = normalization constant for ground state
Now we can generate wavefunctions for higher v values (1, 2, 3, …) by 
applying creation operator on ψ0 once, twice and so on.

 (v + 1)(v + 2)av+2 + (λ – 1 – 2v)av
 = 0; v = 0, 1, 2, 3, … …(8)
 The equation (8) is known as RECURSION FORMULA.
The power series given in equation (5) gives H → ∞ if y → ∞. To 
improve such result, we choose values of λ such that value of av
 in 
Recursion formula becomes zero after a certain number of terms so that 
we have polynomial solutions instead of power series. This is achieved 
by setting 
 (λ – 1 – 2v) = 0 …(9)

Fig. 6.3. Energy spacing of linear harmonic oscillator.

where, v =

Therefore, in turn energy spacing in linear harmonic oscillator depends upon 
force constant (k

The nodes (ψ = 0) in the wavefunction plot occur due to the Hermite 
polynomial of the order ‘y’. As the order of Hermite polynomial in the 
wavefunction equation increases, the number of nodes increases. Also as the 
order increases, the vibrational quantum number ‘v’ also increases. Thus, 
as the value of vibrational quantum number increases, the number of nodes 
increases in the wavefunction plot.
The number of nodes in the vibrational wavefunction plot = v.

6.8 SYMMETRY OF THE VIBRATIONAL WAVEFUNCTION
• The symmetry is assigned to a function, f(x), according to;
 Symmetric function:/ f(x) = – f(x) → odd functions are symmetric
Antisymmetric function: f(x) = – f(–x) → even functions are antisymmetric
• When two functions are multiplied, their symmetry follows certain rules:
 (i) (odd function) × (odd function) = Even function
 (ii) (even function) × (even function) = Even function
 (iii) (even function) × (odd function) = Odd function
 (iv) (odd function) × (even function) = Odd function
From these rules, we conclude that, whenever two functions of same 
symmetry are multiplied (i.e., both odd or both even), the resultant 
function is an even function. However, functions of different symmetry 
(i.e., one odd and other even) give odd function as resultant.
• The symmetry of the vibrational wavefunction (whether odd or even) 
depends upon the Hermite polynomial. The Hermite polynomials are 
odd functions for odd values of ‘v’ and they are even functions for even 
values of ‘v’.
• The symmetry of the vibrational wavefunction is important for calculation 
of integrals while solving the properties of the system (shown in 
section 6.9).
 Like, 
−∞
+∞ ∫
f x( ) dx = 0 [if f(x) is an odd function]
6.9 CALCULATION OF PROPERTIES OF LINEAR HARMONIC 
OSCILLATOR
Properties of the linear harmonic oscillator can be solved using the concept of 
symmetry. The vibrational wavefunctions are odd functions for odd values of 
‘v’ and even functions for even values of ‘v’.282 Chapter 6 Linear Harmonic Oscillator: Quantisation of Vibrational Energy

to every other wavefunction.
i.e.

6.11. VIRIAL THEOREM
It is a very important theorem in Quantum mechanics which applies only on 
those systems which have potential energy. According to virial theorem the 
potential energy can be represented as:
V = axb
where a and b are constants
then 2〈K.E.〉 = b〈P.E.〉286 Chapter 6 Linear Harmonic Oscillator: Quantisation of Vibrational Energy
or 〈K.E.〉 =

〈P.E.〉
Verification of Virial Theorem:
 1. In case of linear harmonic oscillator
V =

2
2
kx
\ a =

2
 and b = 2
Hence, 2〈K.E.〉 = 2〈P.E.〉
i.e. 〈K.E.〉 = 〈P.E.〉
Since Total energy = Ev
 = K.E. + P.E.
\ 〈K.E.〉 = 〈P.E.〉 =

6.12. VIBRATIONAL SPECTRA
The solution for the linear harmonic oscillator gives the complete understanding 
for the vibrational spectra. The vibrational energy of a molecule undergoing any 
vibration (streching, bending etc.) in spectroscopy is given by:
 Ev
 = hv v +







2
 v = 0, 1, 2, 3, …
According to this, it has been proved that vibrational energy levels are 
quantised with energy spacing equal to hv.

When a molecule absorbs electromagnetic radiation, under vibrational 
spectroscopy (i.e. IR region), it gets excited to higher vibrational levels. 
However, excitation to higher vibrational levels follows certain selection rules. 
Those transitions which follow selection rules are called as allowed transitions 
and which do not follow selection rules are called forbidden transitions.
Quantum mechanically, transition probability for all allowed transitions 
is non zero and for forbidden transitions it is zero. Transition probability can 
be determined by finding the average transition dipole moment integral (mv′v
).

If, mv′v
 = 0 (forbidden transition)
and mv′v
≠ 0 (allowed transition)
For a molecule to be vibrational active, it should experience change in 
its dipole moment during vibration. If mv′v
≠ 0, then there is change in dipole 
moment. Therefore, transitions are allowed and hence molecule is vibrational 
active. If mv′v
= 0, then there is no change in dipole moment. Therefore, transitions 
are forbidden and hence molecule is vibrational inactive.

 Therefore, vibrational transition from v′ = 1 to v = 4 is forbidden.
Conclusion:
Therefore, we can conclude that according to selection rule only the transitions 
following Dv = ±1 are allowed. But from v′ = 0 → v = 2 or v′ = 1 → v = 3 i.e., 
Dv = ±2 are forbidden. Also Dv = ±3 (v′ = 0 → v = 3 and v′ = 1 → v = 4) are 
also forbidden transitions.
Hence, quantum mechanically it was proved that selection rule for allowed 
vibrational transitions follow as Dv = ±1.

7.1 NECESSITY OF REPLACING BOHR THEORY
Bohr theory was not satisfactory as it failed to provide an interpretation of 
relative line intensities and splitting of spectral lines in the presence of electric 
field and magnetic field in the hydrogen spectrum. This theory also failed 
completely when it was applied to explain the energies and spectra of more 
complex atoms. In this chapter, we consider the application of Schrodinger wave 
theory to one-electron atom. The simplest one-electron system is the Hydrogen 
atom, whose Schrodinger equation can be exactly solved. Other one-electron 
system like He+
, Li2+ etc. can also be solved exactly. The chemical system 
with more than one-electron cannot be solved exactly due to electron-electron 
repulsion, which is the most problematic term.
7.2 Setting of Schrodinger Equation for Hydrogen Atom
The time independent form of Schrodinger equation is
total total Hˆ ψ = Etotalψtotal
where, total Hˆ
 = Hamiltonian operator
 Etotal = Total energy
 ψtotal = Total wavefunction
Since the hydrogen like systems contain two particles i.e. nucleus and 
electron, thus ψtotal depends on six coordinate variables, three for electron 
(x
e
, y
e
, z
e
) and three for the nucleus (x

Also the potential energy is internal in nature (exists within the system). 
We assume that when r = ∞, potential energy is zero and potential energy of 
system is independent of time. Therefore, electron is moving in a conservative 
force field, thus the Schrodinger equation is time independent and is given as

Since hydrogen-atom is considered to be two particle system (one electron 
and the other nucleus), thus the total energy (ET
) can be divided into two parts:
Total 
energy of 
system
= Electronic energy of 
system
(Energy due to 
movement of electron 
with respect to 
nucleus)
+ Translational energy of the 
system
(Energy due to motion of atom 
as a whole i.e., centre of mass 
moves this can be compared with 
the particle moving in a box)

According to Bohr theory, Bohr energy is Ee
 i.e., deals with electron 
revolving in orbit and atom was stationary according to him i.e., Et

This eq. (7.12) is the main Schrodinger equation which is to be solved 
to get the electronic energy (Ee
) of hydrogen-atom. This is called Electronic 
Schrodinger equation for hydrogen-atom.
This eq. (7.12) is very difficult to solve. The potential energy term prevents 
or does not let us solve this equation in cartesian coordinates i.e., main stumbling 
block is potential energy term. Thus, we first convert eq. (7.12) into polar 
coordinates. Now, atoms have spherical symmetry and in systems having 
spherical symmetry we can use polar coordinates.

The above equation is similar to the Schrodinger equation derived in case 
of rigid rotator (Sec. 5.3). Actually the case of rigid rotator is same as that of 
hydrogen atom in the sense that both have two particles in them. But the only 
difference between them is that in case of rigid rotator, the distance between 
the two particles is fixed and thus radial part of the wavefunction is not solved 
in rigid rotator. Whereas, in case of hydrogen atom, distance between the two 
particles (i.e., electron and nucleus) is not fixed, thus radial part has to solved 
in case of hydrogen atom.

In the above equation, Ist and IVth terms depends only on ‘r’, whereas, IInd
and IIIrd terms depends only θ. But the sum of all the terms is equal to a constant.304 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy
Thus, we put, (Ist + IVth) term = +β

wave equation for hydrogen atom is a eigen value equation.306 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy

The above equation is a differential equation whose solution is given as
F(φ) = C · e
±imφ
 …(7.19)
This function F should be finite, and consistent in order to be an acceptable 
wavefunction. Also angle φ varies from 0 to 2π. (refer Fig. 5.2). Thus, for 
function F to be continuous, the value of F at φ should be equal to the value of 
function at (φ + 2π). Thus, when the angle φ is replaced by (φ + 2π), the same 
set of points in space is obtained.
 F(φ) = F(φ + 2π)
(or) F(0) = F(2π)
Multiply both sides by ‘im’ and taking exponential, we get
 exp (im φ) = exp [im (φ + 2π)]

Also, cos 2πm + i sin 2πm = 1 (From De Moivre’s Theorem)
\ e
im 2π
 = cos 2πm + i sin 2πm = 1
and this is possible only if
 m = 0, ±1, ±2, …
Hence ‘m’ is the quantum number satisfying the above values according to 
the solution. The result is same as that of magnetic quantum number of Bohr 
Sommerfield model. Thus, the function F depends on the value of one quantum 
number i.e., m.
In order that these wavefunctions R, Θ and F are finite, well behaved 
and consistent with the boundary conditions, centrain quantum restrictions 
are introduced. These restrictions appear in the form of quantum number.
Total wavefunction, ψ to be normalised and hence each part of function is 
to be normalised. For the above equation (eq. 7.19) to be well behaved, we need 
to find the normalisation constant. Hence, to normalise this function

The above equation has introduced another coefficient ‘l’, whose allowed 
values are 0, 1, 2, 3, … etc. This is same as azimuthal quantum number in Bohr￾Sommerfeld model. The above equation also imposes restrictions on allowed 
value of m. In above equation a term (l – | m |)! appears, that means if | m | is 
allowed to be greater than l, the factorial of a negative number would result, 
which is undefined. Hence m can have values, 0, ±1, ±2 upto ±l i.e., m cannot 
be greater than l.
Thus, the function Θ depends on the value of two quantum numbers i.e.,
l and | m |. These solutions are obtained provided the following conditions are 
satisfied 
 l = 0, 1, 2, 3, …
 m = 0, ±1, ±2, ± 3, … ±l.
m can have (2l + 1) values for a given value of l.

 This expression is in exact agreement with the Bohr model. This expression 
has a coefficient ‘n’, which is same as principal quantum number in Bohr 
model. Thus, electronic energy of hydrogen atom is quantised i.e., depends 
on ‘n’ and is independent of quantum numbers ‘m’ and ‘l’. This ‘n’ is only 
in radial part and does not occur in Θ and F part of the wavefunction. So 
the electronic energy of hydrogen atom is related to distance of electron 
from the nucleus (r) and is independent of angular part (θ and φ).
 Also in the above expression of electronic energy (Ee
), all the terms have 
constant values except the principal quantum number ‘n’

2. Radial wavefunction, Rn,l(r) of Hydrogen atom:
 The radial wavefunction gives the distribution of the electron with respect 
of its distance ‘r’ from the nucleus. It depends only on the value of quantum 
numbers: n and l.
 There are two possible forms of radial wavefunction:

operator [Derivation done in knowledge bank of section 7.2.3(A)

 …(7.23)
 where, Nn l, max
 is the normalisation constant.
 This expression for calculating radial wavefunction is valid only for n and 
lmax
. For other values of l (i.e., other than lmax
), the normalisation constant 
and hence the radial wavefunction is calculated by using annihilation 
operator.

This equation has introduced a new coefficient ‘n’ which has allowed values 
1, 2, 3, …, ∞, same as of the principal quantum number of Bohr’s theory. This 
equation also imposes restriction on quantum number ‘l’. In this wavefunction, 
a term (n – l – 1) appears, that means maximum value of l can be (n – 1). If ‘l’ 
is greater than (n – 1), then factorial of a negative number would result, which 
is undefined. So ‘l’ can have values 0, 1, 2, … upto (n – 1). Also value of n
cannot be zero or negative for the same reason.

However by using eq. (2) we can only generate radial function of hydrogen 
atom for lmax
 value corresponding to n value i.e. we can find radial function 
for 1s, 2p, 3d and 4f orbitals only.

This expression is the radial function of 1s orbital.
Now, we calculate the normalisation constant for 1s orbital (i.e., N1,0). 
using the condition for normalisation
∫
ψ ψ* ⋅ dτ = 1
Conversion of cartesian to polar coordinates gives,
 dx · dy · dz = dτ = r2 dr · sin θ dθ · dφ
where r varies from 0 to ∞, θ varies from 0 to π and φ varies from 0 to 2π. 
For n and lmax
 value, ψe
(r, θ, φ) only corresponds to the radial wavefunction 
(we are excluding the θ and φ part here). Therefore, we consider the radial 
part only for the normalisation.
Hence, ψe
(r, θ, φ) → Rn, lmax

• Expression of radial wavefunction for n and l values (other than lmax

If we wish to generate the radial wavefunction for any value lower

wavefunction of hydrogen atom for n and lmax
 value.
 Suppose, we wish to generate the radial wavefunction for 2s orbital 
then we can generate the radial wavefunction for the same by applying 
annihilation operator on the orbital corresponding to same n value in

Similarly, we can apply annihilation operator on R3,2 once to generate radial 
wavefunction for R3,1 and can apply annihilation operator on R3,1 again (or 
twice on R3,2) to generate radial wavefunction for R3,0.
Therefore, we can find radial wavefunction for any orbital form Rn,lmax
equation by applying the required number operator ˆ
( ) Rl
−
 on the Rn,lmax 
wavefunction to generate radial wavefunction for values corresponding to 
lower value of l (lower than lmax
). Since annihilation operator only steps 
down the value of l by one unit and does not impact n value.

 s(s + 1) – l(l + 1) = 0
which yields s = l or –(l + 1)

So, that

Substituting λ = n in the above equation we get
 rG″ + {2(l + 1) – r}G′ + (n – l – 1)G = 0

7.3 QUANTUM NUMBERS
The total wavefunction of hydrogen atom is expressed as a product of three 
functions, which depends on three quantum numbers i.e., n, l and m
ψn,l,m(r, θ, φ) = Rn,l(r) · Θl,m(θ) · Fm
(φ)
The product of Θ and F part is taken as Yl,m and is known as Spherical 
Harmonics
ψn,l,m(r, θ, φ) = Rn,l(r) · R r n l, , Yl m ( )• ( • )
( )
θ φ
Spherical Harmonics
  
where,
Rn,l(r) is the radial function which depends only on the distance ‘r’ from 
the nucleus (independent of direction). It is defined by two quantum numbers 
i.e. n and l.
Yl,m(θ · φ) is the angular function which is independent of distance ‘r’ 
but depends on the direction as given by the angles θ and φ. Thus, the two 
functions Θ and F taken together give the angular distribution of the electron. 
The angular dependence depends on the quantum numbers l and m and not at 
all on the principal quantum number ‘n’.
7.3.1	Significance	of	Quantum	Numbers
Quantum numbers were earlier postulated in Bohr-Sommerfeld theory to 
describe the various orbits. Quantum numbers were not actually derived from 
the theory itself but proposed out of necessity. The quantum numbers and their 
allowed values arise as a consequence of the solution of the wave equation for 
hydrogen atom. 7.3 Quantum Numbers 337
In wave mechanics, the electron distribution in an atom is divided into 
shells which in turn are supposed to consists of one or more subshells and the 
subshells are assumed to be made up of one or more orbitals. The electrons 
occupy these orbitals (an orbital is defined as the region in space around the 
nucleus where the probability of finding an electron is maximum).
Each electron in an atom is identified by quantum numbers n, l and m which 
arises from the wavefunction.
These quantum numbers and their values are discussed below:
 1. Principal or Radial Quantum Number (n): It arises from the solution 
of the radial part of ψe
 of hydrogen atom and identifies the shell or level 
to which the electron belongs. These shells are regions in space indicating 
the “most probable” position of the electron from the nucleus. It helps to 
determine the average distance of the electron from the nucleus. As the 
value of ‘n’ increases, the average distance of electron from the nucleus 
increases. 
 The quantum number ‘n’ can have any positive integral values from 1 to 
∞. The larger the value of n, the farther is the shell from the nucleus
n = 1, 2, 3, … ∞.
 The various principal energy levels are also designated by the letters K, L, 
M, N, O, P, … etc.
 Theoretically, there is no limit to the number of shells or levels but seventh 
shell (n = 7) is the highest shell occupied by the known elements. Actually, 
the principal quantum number ‘n’ designates the main energy level to which 
an electron belongs.
 2. Azimuthal or Subsidiary or Angular Momentum Quantum Number 
(l): It refers to the subshell or sublevel to which an electron belongs. It also 
determine the magnitude of angular momentum of the electron present in 
any subshell and also determine the shape of the three dimensional orbital.
 The azimuthal quantum number can have values from 0 to (n – 1)
 l = 0, 1, 2, 3, … (n – 1)
 This means that value of ‘l’ for the subshells of a shell are governed by 
‘n’. When n = 1, there is only one subshell with the value of l = 0. When 
n = 2, there are two subshells with the values l = 0, 1. When n = 3, there 
are three subshells that have values l = 0, 1, 2 and so on. 
 For every value of l, there is a separate notation to indicate subshell
Quantum number (l) 0 1 2 3 4 5…
Subshell notation s p d f g h…338 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy
 The first four notations; s, p, d and f are initial letters used earlier to identify 
spectral lines; sharp, principal, diffused and fundamental but subsequent 
notations used for l > 3 proceed alphabetically; g, h, i, j, … so on.
 Knowing the value of n and l, we designate the subshell.

 For Hydrogen atom; the energy of electron is determined solely by the 
principal quantum number ‘n’. Thus for hydrogen atom, the subshell 
energies are equal.
 1s < 2s = 2p < 3s = 3p = 3d < 4s = 4p = 4D = 4f < …
 Although, the shapes of 2s and 2p subshells are different, but an electron 
has the same energy when it is in 2s or in 2p subshell.
 But for multi-electron atom, the energy of electron depends on the value 
of n and l. That is for a given principal quantum number; s, p, d, f, … all 
have different energies. The energy increases with increasing value of ‘l’.
 1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < …
 The reason for having different energies of the subshell is the mutual 
repulsion among the electrons in a multi-electron atom. The only electrical 
interaction present in hydrogen atom is the attraction between the negatively 
charged electron and positively charged nucleus. Whereas, in multi￾electron-atom, besides the presence of attraction between the electron and 
nucleus, there are repulsion between every electron and other electrons 
present in the atom.
 3. Magnetic Quantum Number (m or ml
): Each subshell consists of one 
or more orbitals (regions of space with maximum probability of finding 
the electron). The quantum member ‘m’ refers to the number of orbitals 
present in a given subshell. Actually, the number of orbitals is equal to the 
number of ways the electrons in subshell can orient themselves in space.
 The magnetic quantum number for a given subshell ‘l’ can have values 
from +l … 0 … –l. 7.3 Quantum Numbers 339
m = +l, (l – 1), (l – 2) … 0 … –(l – 2), –(l – 1), –l
 Thus, for every value of l, m has 2l + 1 values. For example,
 (i) For l = 0 (s-subshell), m can have only one value, i.e., m = 0. This 
means that s-subshell has only one orientation in space. In other words, 
s-subshell has only one orbital called s-orbital.
 (ii) For l = 1 (p-subshell), m can have three values, i.e., m = –1, 0 and +1. In 
other words, p-subshell has three orientations in space. In other words, 
a p-subshell has three orbitals. Since these three orbitals are oriented 
along x-axis, y -axis and z-axis, therefore, they are commonly referred 
to as px
, py
 and pz
.
m +1 –1 0
px

pz
 (iii) For l = 2 (d-subshell), m can have five values, i.e., m = –2, –1, 0, +1 and 
+2. This implies that there are five different orientations of d-subshell 
in space. In other words, d-subshell has five d-orbitals.

 (iv) Similarly, when l = 3 (f-subshell), m can have seven values, i.e.,
m = –3, –2, –1, 0, +1, +2 and +3. This implies that there are seven 
different orientations of the f-subshell. In other words, f-subshell has 
seven f-orbitals.
7.3.2 Importance of Quantum Numbers in Explaining Hydrogen 
Spectrum
The quantum mechanical results (Schrodinger equation) of the hydrogen atom 
successfully predict all the aspects of the hydrogen-atom spectrum including 
some phenomenas that could not be explained by the Bohr model.
Like the various quantum numbers (n, l, m) were able to explain the different 
splitting of lines in H-spectrum.
 (a) The principal quantum number (n) helps to explain the main lines 
of the spectrum on the basis of electronic jumps between the shells.
 (b) The azimuthal quantum number (l) helps to explain the fine lines of 
the spectrum. To explain the presence of these fine lines, it was suggested 
that in a multi-electron atom, the electrons present in any main shell do 
not have the same energy. This is because they move along different 
paths and hence have different angular momentum. Thus, within the 340 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy
same principal shell, there are present a number of subshells. These 
subshells differ only by a very small energy
 1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p …
 As a result, the number of electronic jumps increases and so is the 
number of lines. This quantum number helps to explain the fine lines 
of the spectrum.
 (c) The magnetic quantum number (m) helps to explain the fact that 
when the source producing the line spectrum is placed in an external 
magnetic field, each fine spectral line splits into a number of lines 
(Zeeman effect). When the external magnetic field was removed, the 
fine lines comes back as they were earlier.
 This fact can be explained as follows: an electron due to its orbital 
motion around the nucleus generates an electric field. This electric 
field in turn produces a magnetic field. Thus, under the influence of the 
external magnetic field, the electrons of a subshell can orient themselves 
in certain preferred regions of space around the nucleus and the number 
of ways the electron in subshell can orient themselves in space are called 
orbitals. Thus, the magnetic quantum number determines the number of 
preferred orientations of the electron present in a subshell. Since, each 
orientation corresponds to an orbital, therefore, the magnetic quantum 
number determines the number of orbitals present in a subshell.
7.4 DEGENERATE AND NON-DEGENERATE ORBITALS
In the absence of external magnetic field, the orbitals of a particular energy 
level have same energy. The orbitals having same energy are called degenerate 
orbitals.
For example, : For l = 1 (p-subshell), the three orbitals px
, py
 and pz
 are 
degenerate
Epx
 = Epy
 = Epz
 (absence of magnetic field)
But in the presence of external magnetic field, this degeneracy is lost 
because the orbitals are oriented differently with respect to the applied field. 
The orbitals now have no more same energy. The orbitals of a subshell having 
different energy are called non-degenerate orbitals.

 E3,0,0 = E3,1,1 = E3,1,0 = E3,1,–1 = E3,2,2 = E3,2,1 = E3,2,0 = E3,2,–1 = E3,2,–2
 
Even though the basic probability for an electron existing in a particular 
energy level depends on the magnitude of energy level. But, greater 
the number of degenerate state, greater is the probability that electron 
will assume that level.
 Also, for a given transition of energy, the spectral intensity will be 
proportional to the degeneracy of the initial higher energy state. So, 
this concept of degeneracy helps to interpret the intensity of spectral 
lines. Hence, the concept of degeneracy of energy level in spectrum of 
hydrogen atom proof a partial explanation of difference in relative line 
intensities.

 when n = 5, it is sixteen fold degenerate.
3. Energy of electron in 2s and 2p orbital of hydrogen atom is equal while 
the energy of electron in 2s and 2p of He atom is different. Why?
 Ans. For hydrogen atom, the energy of electron is determined solely 
by the principal quantum number. Thus, for hydrogen atom, the subshell 
energies are equal
i.e., 1s < 2s = 2p < 3s = 3p = 3d < …
 Thus the electron has the same energy when it is in 2s or 2p subshell.
 But for multi-electron atoms, the energy of electron depends on the value 
of n and l. The energy increases with the increasing value of l.
i.e. 1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < …
 This is because the only interaction present in hydrogen atom is the 
attraction between the negatively charged electron and positively charged 
nucleus and thus no mutual repulsion among the electrons in hydrogen 344 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy
atom. Whereas in case of multi-electron atom, besides the presence of 
attraction between the electron and nucleus, there are repulsion between 
every electron and other electrons present in the atom, which causes 
difference in energies of subshells.
4. Explain as to why orbitals 1d, 2g or 3f are not possible?
 Ans. This is because the sets of quantum numbers required for these orbitals 
are not allowed.
 (i) For 1d orbital; n = 1 and l = 2 which is not allowed because values of 
l are governed by n, that is l = 0, 1, 2, …, (n – 1). Thus, for n = 1; l = 0 
value only.
 (ii) For 2g orbital; to n = 2, l = 4 which again is not possible. For n = 2; l
can have values 0, 1 only. 
 (iii) For 3f orbital; n = 3, l = 4, which is not allowed because for n = 3; l can 
values 0, 1, 2 only.

. The values in question are permissible.
 (ii) Not allowed because when l = 0, m cannot have values other than zero 
(m = 0).
 (iii) Not allowed because when l = 1, m has allowed values = +1, 0, –1 only.
 (iv) Not allowed because for n = 2; l can have values equal = 0, 1 only. 
Therefore, n = 2, l = 2, is not permissible.

 For 3d subshell, l = 2, \ m = –2, –1, 0, +1, +2 (i.e., 5 orbital)
7.6 WAVEFUNCTION OF THE HYDROGEN ATOM
The total wavefunction of hydrogen atom is expressed as a product three functions. 
One of these depend only on distance (r) called the radial wavefunction. The 
other two depend on the direction θ and φ called the angular wavefunction.

We have to understand the wavefunction in order to visualize the electron 
density distribution around the nucleus in an atom. The spatial distribution 
of electron density in an atom is described by means of atomic orbitals and 
these atomic orbitals are represented by wavefunction ψ(r, θ, φ). The square 
of wavefunction, ψ2
, gives the probability of finding the electron in a given 
volume of space designated by coordinates r, θ and φ. 
Also the expression for ψ(r, θ, φ) in the form of mathematical equation do 
not help in the understanding of the probability distribution of the electron. Their 
significance can be better understood by showing radial (r) plots and angular 
plots (θ, φ) of the wavefunction separately.
7.6.1 Radial Wavefunction and Radial Plots
Radial wavefunction, Rn,l(r), depends only on the distance of the electron from 
the nucleus. It tells us about the distribution of the electron as a function of 
distance ‘r’ from the nucleus. It is characterised by the value of the principal 
quantum number (n) and orbital angular momentum quantum number (l).
In this section, we will show that, actually the radial function R(r) has no 
physical significance. But 4πr
2R
2
 gives the probability of finding the electron in 
a small volume dV near the point at which R is measured. For a given value of r, 
the number of small volumes is 4πr
2
, so the probability of the electron being at a 
distance r from the nucleus is 4πr
2R
2
. This is called radial distribution function.
• The radial wavefunction or electron distribution in an orbital may 
be represented in three ways:
1. Probability Amplitude Curve: [Plot of Rn,l(r) Vs r]

)
 because other terms in the above 
expression of R1,0(r) are constant i.e., Z = 1 and a0
 = 0.529 Å for 
hydrogen atom. Also the exponential term in the above expression of 
R1,0(r) shows that R1,0(r) decrease with increase in the value of r. This 
variation of R1,0(r) Vs r for 1s orbital is shown in Fig. 7.2.

 The points on the spherical surface where the radial function has a zero 
value i.e., R(r) = 0 is known as the radial nodal point or node or radial 
node. Alternatively, the point where the wavefunction, Rn,l(r), changes 
sign from (+ve) to (–ve) represents a node.
 In general, the number of radial nodes in a given radial function is given 
by (n – l – 1). Here, for 1s orbital, number of radial nodes = 0.

of R2,0(r) shows that R2,0(r) decrease with increase in the value of r. Also the 
exponential factor of this function R2,0(r) is just half of the corresponding 
exponential factor of the function R1,0(r) i.e.
R1,0(r) ∝ e
–Zr/a0 and R2,0(r) ∝ e

Thus, the value of R2,0(r) decreases more slowly as compared to that of 
R1,0(r).

The R3,2(r) Vs r curve for the 3d
orbital of hydrogen atom is similar to 
that of 2p orbital. There are no nodes 
and R3,2(r) remains positive and aquires 
a maximum value before decreasing to 
an infinitesimally small value. For 3d
orbital, n – l – 1 = 3 – 2 – 1 = 0, i.e.,

For most of the plots shown above, the value of Rn,l
(r) is maximum at r = 0, 
this cannot be true as the probability of finding the electron at the nucleus is 
always zero.
Also Rn,l
(r) is showing positive as well as negative values in the probability 
amplitude curve of 2s orbital (Fig. 7.3), 3s orbital (Fig. 7.5) and 3p orbital 
(Fig. 7.6) and 4s, 4p, 4d orbitals (Fig. 7.8) and probability could never be 
negative.
Thus, we are getting wrong information from these radial curves. Thus, 
radial function Rn,l (r) has no physical significance, but R
2
n,l (r) gives the 
probability of finding the electron around the nucleus. Therefore, we plot 
probability density curve i.e., R
2
n,l (r) Vs r for the different orbitals.
2. Probability Density Curve: [Plot of Rn,l

Variation of Rn,l
2
 (r) is quite similar to the variation of Rn,l (r) as both are 
exponential curves, except that the Rn,l
2
 (r) is everywhere either positive or zero. 
Whereas, Rn,l (r) Vs r plots of some of the orbitals like 2s, 3s, 3p, 4s, 4p, 4d etc. 
show negative values of radial distribution.
Therefore, in order to avoid negative values, variation of Rn,l
2
 (r) is plotted 
as a function of r. Such plots are known as probability density distribution 
curves or probability density curves.
These plots are more meaningful as it gives the probability density of the 
electron at that point.7.6 Wavefunction of the Hydrogen Atom 353

In case of 2s orbital, the probability is again 
maximum near the nucleus and then decreases as the 
distance from the nucleus increases. The intermediate 
region where the probability is zero is called a node.
Thus, 2s orbital differs from 1s orbital in having 
one radial node within it.
This probability density variation can be visualised 
in terms of electron cloud density or dot-population 
picture (Fig. 7.12).

In general, any ‘ns’ orbital has (n – 1) radial nodes because for s-orbital, 
l = 0, thus (n – l – 1) term becomes (n – 1).
Similarly, any ‘np’ orbital has (n – 2) radial nodes because for p-orbital, 
l = 1, thus (n – l – 1) term becomes (n – 2) and so on.
From the above probability density curves, it is seen that the magnitude 
of Rn,l
2
 (r) is decreasing with increase in the value of r. Also the probability of 
finding the electron right close to the nucleus is the highest, this cannot be true 
as the probability of finding the electron at the nucleus is always zero. Thus, 
although Rn,l
2
 (r) is showing positive or zero value everywhere on the curve but 
value of Rn,l
2
 (r) is maximum at r = 0, which is not possible.
Therefore, even these plots cannot be a satisfactory way of representing 
the radial wavefunction. Therefore, we move on to the Radial Probability 
Density Curves.7.6 Wavefunction of the Hydrogen Atom 355

In order to visualise the total amount of the electron cloud within a spherical 
shell of volume dV placed at radii r and (r + dr) from the nucleus, we define 
the radial probability density, as
Radial Probability density = Volume of the spherical shell × Probability density
 = (4πr
2 dr) × R

where, P(r) = 4πr

(r) = Radial probability density function.
This radial probability density function, P(r), describes the total probability 
of finding the electron in a spherical shell of thickness ‘dr’ located at the distance 
‘r’ from the nucleus. The plot of radial probability density function versus
distance from the nucleus is Radial probability density curve.

In case of 1s orbital, the plot of R1,0
2
 (r) Vs r (Fig. 7.9) indicates that the 
probability of finding 1s electron is maximum right to the nucleus (r = 0). 
However, according to radial probability density curve of 1s orbital (Fig. 7.16), 
the probability of finding 1s electron is maximum at a distance r = a0
 from the 
nucleus. This can be explained in the manner that even though the 1s electron 
exists maximum near the nucleus but the electronic cloud is not maximum 
near the nucleus. Therefore, the consider a number of concentric rings of same 
thickness (dr) but of different radii around the nucleus. The ring closest to the 
nucleus has maximum density but as the volume of shell near the nucleus is 
small, the total electron mass is not maximum because of the small volume. 
On the other hand, a ring of a very large radius i.e., which is away from the 
nucleus, even though volume is large but density is less and electronic cloud 
is not maximum there. But at a certain intermediate value of the radius ‘r’ of 
the ring, should have the largest mass or maximum electron density. This is 
agreed by Bohr concept. Thus, in electronic picture, electron has probability 
of existing at all values of ‘r’ but maximum value exists at r = a0
. In case of 
hydrogen atom, r = a0
 = 0.529 Å = 52.9 pm, a value which is exactly the same 
as that calculated from the Bohr’s theory as Bohr’s radius for the first orbit.
Thus, the Bohr’s concept of orbit is partially explained by the quantum 
mechanical treatment, but the very existence of the precise orbit in an atom 
has no place in the quantum mechanical treatment. Quantum mechanics says 
that the electron has some probability for its existence at all values of r, but it 
has maximum value at a distance r = a0
. Thus, an important difference between 
Bohr’s model and wave mechanical model lies in the fact that whereas according 
to the former, the electron revolves at a constant distance of 0.529 Å from the 
nucleus, according to the latter, the electron is most likely to be found at this 
distance but there is a probability of finding the electron at distances shorter 
as well as larger than 0.529 Å. This distance of maximum probability is called 
radius of maximum probability and in case of hydrogen atom, it is equal 
to 52.9 pm (0.529 Å), i.e., equal to Bohr’s radius for the first orbit (generally 
represented by a0
).
After reaching a maximum value at a distance of r = a0
, then the probability 
of finding 1s electron begins to decrease abruptly and becomes negligible at 
large distances.7.6 Wavefunction of the Hydrogen Atom 357

Fig. 7.17. Radial probability density curve for 2s orbital.
 Number of maxima in radial distribution plot = (n – l)
 Number of radial nodes = (n – l – 1)
The plot of 2s orbital has two maxima, a smaller one near the nucleus at 
0.4 Å and a bigger one at a larger distance from that nucleus at 3.0 Å.
The peak (or maxima) which comes at last is highest and the peak close to 
the nucleus shows the penetration effect.
In between the two maxima, there is a distance r from the nucleus at which 
radial probability function becomes zero. This shows that the probability of 
finding the electron at this distance is zero. This point is called radial node or 
node or nodal point. In case of 2s orbital, it exists at a distance of 2a0
 from the 
nucleus. Thus, for n = 2 and l = 0, the number of high probability regions = 2 
and number of nodes = 1.
 (c) n = 2, l = 1 (i.e., 2p orbital):
 The variation of P(r) Vs r for 2p orbital is shown in Fig. 7.18.
Fig .7.18. Radial probability density curve for 2p orbital.358 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy
Radial probability plot for 2p orbital has zero value at r = 0. It increases 
as the r increases and reaches a maximum. The plot of 2p orbital does not 
show any node at finite value of r. This is consistent with the general formula
(n – l – 1) for the number of radial nodes in a wavefunction.
When compared to the plot for 2p, the plot for 2s has one small maxima 
near the nucleus. This shows that 2s electron spends quite some time closer 
to the nucleus and hence is held more tightly to the nucleus than 2p electron. 
That is why 2s electron is more stable and has lower energy than 2p electron.
 (d) n = 3, l = 0, 1 and 2 (i.e. 3s, 3p and 3d orbitals):
 The variation of P(r) Vs r for 3s orbital is shown in Fig. 7.19.
Fig. 7.19. Radial probability density curve for 3s orbital.
The radial probability plot for 3s orbital shows three regions of high 
probability and two nodes. The peak close to the nucleus shows the penetration 
effect. There is a probability of finding the electron density of 3s even beneath 
2s, 2p etc.
Similarly, the variation of P(r) Vs r for 3p and 3d orbital is shown in
Fig. 7.20 and Fig .7.21.
Fig 7.20. Radial probability density curve for 3p orbital.
Fig. 7.21. Radial probability density curve for 3d orbital.7.6 Wavefunction of the Hydrogen Atom 359
For 3p orbital, there is one node and for 3d there is no node. This is because 
number of nodes is equal to (n – l – 1).
 (e) Comparison of 3s, 3p and 3d radial probability density curves:
 Also when the plots for 3s, 3p and 3d (Fig. 7.22) are compared, it is seen that:
 (i) largest maxima for 3s is more extended in space, then that of 3p
which in turn is more extended than 3d. Thus, the most probable 
radius decreases in the order 3s > 3p > 3d.
 (ii) 3s orbital is more concentrated in small region of spaces than 3p, 
while 3d is quite diffused.
 (iii) The term penetration simply means the distribution of electron 
density of outer orbitals into the region of electron density of 
inner orbitals. This term is used to signify the fact that though we 
are talking about shell model in terms of concentric spheres, yet 
the probability of finding electron density from an outer orbital is 
penetrating or spreading into the region of inner orbitals.
 Here, in this case the penetration power of 3s > 3p > 3d as seen 
from the curves. There is probability of finding electron density 
even beneath 2s, 2p etc.
 (iv) The maxima of 3d is at the greatest value of r in comparison to 3s
and 3p. This has given a clear picture for the size of orbitals.

7.6.2. Angular Wavefunction and Shape of Orbitals
The angular wavefunction, Yl,m(θ, φ), is independent of distance ‘r’ but depends 
on the direction as given by the angles θ and φ. Thus, the two functions Θ and F
taken together give the angular distribution of the electron. The angular part of 
the wavefunction depends on the quantum numbers l and m and is often referred 
as atomic orbital. The shape of the atomic orbitals thus depend on angles θ and 
φ, which determine geometry of the atom.
• Spherical harmonics represent angular wavefunction of the hydrogen atom.

Physical Interpretation: The physical interpretation of angular 
wavefunction is in the form of shape of orbitals. From eq. (7.27), it is seen 
that angular part of the wavefunction depends on the quantum numbers l and 
m and not at all on the principal quantum number ‘n’. Thus, the shape of the 
orbitals are independent of ‘n’ i.e. shape of all s-orbitals (1s, 2s, 3s, ...), shape 
of all p-orbitals (2p, 3p, 4p, ...), shape of all d-orbitals (3d, 4d, 5d, 6d, ...) and 
so on are same.
In other words, the shape of orbitals are controlled by the angular functions 
and there upon l and m.364 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy

 …(7.28)
Discussion on Shape of s-orbital:
Since there is no angular dependence, so angular part of the wavefunction is 
spherically symmetrical. That is the probability of finding the electron is equal 
in all directions. Thus, s-orbital is spherical in shape and have symmetrical 
orientation.
Also for all s-orbitals (l = 0), there are (n – 1) number of radial nodes and 
no angular nodes
In general,
Number of radial nodes = (n – l – 1)
Number of angular nodes = l
Total number of nodes = n – l – 1 + l = (n – l)
It is difficult to picture an angular wavefunction as a mathematical equation. 
It is much easier to visualize a boundary surface diagram of the orbital. It 
is the diagram of the region containing about 90% of the electron density in 
an atomic orbital. Thus, it is used to represent the shape of an orbital in 2D, as 
orbitals are 3D in nature and it is difficult to represent a 3D image in 2D.
For s-orbitals, the boundary surface diagram are spherical in shape 
as shown in Fig. 7.24.

The size of s-orbitals increases in size, as the value of ‘n’ increases.
2. For p-orbital:
 For the p-orbital, l = 1 and m has three values i.e., 0, + 1 and – 1. Thus, 
there are three p-orbitals designated as p0
, p+1 and p–1. The angular factors 
associated with these orbitals are: (Refer Table 7.7)366 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy

The Fm
 function (p+1 and p–1) are complex, as they contain the imaginary 
term ‘i’. Thus, it is difficult to represent or draw pictures of them in real space. 
But, since they are of equal energy (degenerate) and have same ‘l’ value, we get 
the good results of real wavefunction by linear combination of the imaginary 
part of wavefunction. Linear combination of two wavefunctions is known 
as hybridisation and gives rise to hybrid orbitals. Here, linear combination 
of Yl,m function of p+1 and p–1 results in the hybrid orbitals (px
 and py
).

Since sin θ cos φ and sin θ sin φ corresponds to x and y components of ‘r’ 
respectively (x = r sin θ cos φ, y = r sin θ sin φ and z = r cos θ). Thus, the above 
combinations are respectively labelled as px

In this, the function F0
 does not contain any φ dependence term. The function 
exhibits only θ dependence in the form of cos θ. Thus, the shape of pz
 orbital 
depends on angle θ only.368 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy

Fig. 7.25. Conversion of cartesian to polar coordinates.
The probability to find an electron at θ(0°, 90°, and 180°) is shown as:
When θ = 0°, cos 0° = 1
and θ = 90°, cos 90° = 0
 θ = 180°, cos 180° = –1
Thus, when we put cos 90° = 0 in the above expression, then Y1,0 = Yp
z
 = 0 
i.e., in the xy plane, the probability of finding pz
 electron is zero. Therefore, xy
plane is a nodal plane for pz
 orbital. The charge is therefore distributed above 
and below this plane and shows a rotational symmetry about the z-axis.
Two dimensional plot of the function. Y1,0 (or cos θ) Vs θ, would look like 
two circles (or tangent spheres) in the xz plane (or yz-plane) ; one just above 
the xy-nodal plane and the other just below it as shown in Fig. 7.26. These two 
circles pass through the origin and are symmetrically placed about the z-axis. 
The value of cos θ will have maximum positive and negative values along the 
z-axis, when θ = 0° and θ = 180° respectively.
On the xy plane, the angle θ = 90°, and thus cos 90° = 0. Hence, the two 
circles pass through the origin, which serve as a nodal point.

(ii) Let us consider px
 atomic orbital, whose angular wavefunction is 
written as
 px
 = Y
px
 ≈ sin θ cos φ [Refer eq. (7.30)]
Keeping angle θ constant at π/2, along the x-axis on the xy plane (or xz
plane) the angle φ is either zero or π and thus cos φ = ± 1. Hence, the function 
Yp
x
 will have maximum magnitude along the x-axis. It is because of this reason 
the subscript ‘x’ has been added to the function.
Thus, by keeping θ constant at π/2 and varying angle φ from 0 to 2π [Refer 
Fig. 7.25] we get two dimensional plot of px
 orbital in xy plane (or xz plane). 
The general shape of the plot is identical to that of pz
 orbital. The two circles of 
px
 orbital lie symmetrically about the x-axis (with yz-nodal plane).
We can draw boundary surface diagram to give us the shape of px

(iii) Let us consider 2p

 atomic orbital, whose angular wavefunction is

 Yp
y
≈ sin θ . sin φ [Refer eq. (7.31)]
Keeping angle θ constant at π/2, along the y-axis on the xy plane, (or yz
plane) the angle φ is either π/2 or 3π/2 and thus sin φ = 1. Hence the function 
Ypy
 will have maximum magnitude along the y-axis. It is because of this reason, 
the subscript ‘y’ has been added to the function.
Thus, by keeping θ constant at π/2 and varying angle φ from 0 to 2π (Refer 
Fig. 7.25) we get two dimensional plot of py
 orbital in xy plane (or yz plane). 
The general shape of the plot is identical to that of pz
 orbital. The two circles of 
py
 orbital lie symmetrically about the y-axis (with xz nodal plane). We can draw 
boundary surface diagram to give the shape of py
 orbital as shown in Fig. 7.30.

• Number of angular nodes in various p-orbital:
 In general, number of angular nodal planes = l, thus all the p-orbitals 
have l = 1, nodal plane each.
 Thus, px
 has yz as nodal plane, py
 has zx as nodal plane, and pz
 has xy as 
nodal plane.
• It may be mentioned that the shapes of higher energy level p-orbitals 
i.e., 3p, 4p, 5p, 6p are similar but their sizes increases as the value of n
increases. For example, the shape of 3pz
 orbital is bigger than the shape 
of a 2p
z
 orbital.7.6 Wavefunction of the Hydrogen Atom 371
Moreover, a 3pz
 orbital has two lobes on either side; one bigger lobe and the 
other smaller lobe and these lobes are separated by nodes as shown in Fig. 7.31.

• Sign of wavefunction of s-orbital and p-orbitals:
Angular part Yl,m of the wavefunction may be positive or negative depending 
on θ and φ.
The s-orbital is positive all through because it is independent of θ and φ
and there is no change in its shape which remains spherical.
The p-orbital has one lobe (+ve) and other is (–ve) because the angular part 
of, say pz
, depends on cos θ which has (+ve) sign between 0–90° and 270–360° 
but it has (–ve) sign between 90–180° and 180–270° along z-axis. Shapes and

3. For d-orbital:
For the d-orbital, l = 2, m has five values i.e., 0, + 1, – 1, + 2 and – 2. Thus, 
there are five d-orbitals designated as d0
, d+1, d–1, d+2 and d–2. The angular 
factors associated with these orbitals are; (Refer Table 7.7).

The Fm
 functions (d+1, d–1, d+2 and d–2) are complex, as they contain the 
imaginary term ‘i’. Thus, it is difficult to represent or draw pictures of them 
in real space. But, since the wavefunction for d+1/d–1 and d+2/d–2 have equal 
energy and have same value of l, we get the good results of real wavefunction 
by linear combination of imaginary part of wavefunction. Linear combination 
of two wavefunctions is known as hybridisation and gives rise to hybrid 
orbitals. Linear combination Yl,m of wavefunction of d+1 and d–1 results in dxz
and d

 as hybrid orbitals.

 sin θ cos θ cos φ = sin θ cos φ · cos θ = xz
 sin θ cos θ sin φ = sin θ . sin φ · cos θ = yz
 sin2 θ · sin 2φ = sin2 θ · (2sin φ cos φ) = (sin θ . cos φ) (sin θ sin φ) = xy

2 atomic orbital, whose angular wavefunction is 
written as
Y Y d
z
2
= 2 0,
 = ∼ (3 cos2 θ – 1) [Refer eq. (7.32)]
This function does not contain any imaginary term. Also this function does 
not contain any φ dependence term. The function exhibits only θ dependence. 
Thus, shape of d
z
2 orbital depends on variation of angle θ only. The value of 
function Y2,0 is zero when 3 cos2 θ – 1 = 0 or cos θ = ±
1
3
 or θ = ± 54°44′. 
Thus, a line passing through the origin making an angle θ = 54°44′ with the z-axis 
will be the nodal line. Since, this type of line can be drawn all around the z-axis, 
we have nodal surfaces making cones about the z-axis, as shown in Fig. 7.33.

cos 0° = 1)
If we construct a two dimensional plot of the function keeping angle φ
constant at 0° and varying angle θ, we get four lobes lying symmetrically 
between x and z-axis. These lobes, lie on the xz-plane and it is for this reason 
this orbital is referred as dxz

angle φ, we get four lobes lying symmetrically between x- and y-axis. These 
lobes lie on the xy plane and it is for this reason that this orbital is labelled as d
xy
.

7.6.3 Contour Diagram or Contour Maps
Contour diagram are illustrated with contour lines. It is a curve connecting 
points where the function has the same particular value. It displays the charge 
density in a plane. Imagine a plane through the atom including the nucleus. The 
density is calculated at every point in this plane. All points having same value 
for the electron density are joined by a contour line. Since, the electron density 
depends only or ‘r’, the distance from the nucleus, and not on the direction in 
space, the contours will be circular.
Thus, contour map is useful as it indicates the ‘‘shape’’ of the density 
distribution.
• Contour maps of 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4p, 4d and 4f atomic orbitals and 
their charge density distributions for the hydrogen atom are shown below 
in Fig. 7.43.
The zero contours shown in the maps for the orbitals define the position 
of the nodes. Negative values for the contours of the orbitals are indicated by 
dashed lines and positive values by normal lines.7.6 Wavefunction of the Hydrogen Atom 381

Problems based on angular Wavefunction
 1. ‘s’ orbital is spherically symmetrical? Why?
 Ans. The expression of angular wavefunction of s-orbital has no angular 
(θ, φ) dependence i.e., there is no term containing angle (θ, φ) in the 
expression of Y0,0.
 Y0,0 = 
1
4π
 Since, there is no angular dependence, so s-orbital is spherically symmetrical.384 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy
 2. Draw the contour diagram of 4s orbital and 3p orbital.
 Ans. [Refer “Contour diagrams”, section 7.6.3]
 3. Plot cos θ Vs θ and show that it is one of the angular wavefunction of ‘p’ 
orbital.
 Ans. Two dimensional plot of the function cos θ Vs θ, would look like 
two circles in the xz plane (or yz plane); one just above the xy plane and 
the other just below it. These two circles pass through the origin and are 
symmetrically placed about the z-axis. This is because the value of cos θ 
will have maximum positive and negative values along the z-axis, when 
θ = 0° and θ = 180° respectively. On the xy plane, θ = 90°, cos 90° = 0 and 
thus xy is the nodal plane.
 The boundary surface diagram gives us the shape of pz
orbital.

 Ans. [Refer angular wavefunction part of p-orbitals [(section. 7.6.2)]
 5. What is the difference between node and a nodal plane?
 Ans. Node is the point at which ψ = 0.
 Nodal plane is the plane where ψ = 0 everywhere.
 Like: For 2pz
orbital,
 Number of radial node = n – l – 1 = 2 – 1 – 1 = 0 7.6 Wavefunction of the Hydrogen Atom 385
 Number of angular node = l = 1
 Total number of nodes = (n – l – 1) + l = n – 1 = 2 – 1 = 1
 Nodal plane for 2pz
 orbital is xy plane.

 7. What is the significance of x, y and z in the orbitals dxy

?
 Ans. x, y, z are the coordinate axis. However, d-orbitals like d
xy
, d
yz
 and dzx
are oriented along the xy, yz and zx plane respectively. Unlike, p-orbitals, 
which are aligned along the x, y, z coordinates.
 8. Give the number of radial and angular nodes.
 Ans. Node is the point where ψ = 0
 For radial part = (n – l – 1) nodes
 For angular part = (l) nodes
 Total = (n – l – 1) + l = (n – 1) nodes.
 9. Which of the orbitals do not have angular dependence 3s, 3d, 2p, 1s.
 Ans. Out of the given orbitals, 3s and 1s does not have angular dependence. 
Because, 
 for 1s orbital, Y1,0 = 
1
4π
[Refer Table 7.8]
 for 3s orbital, Y3,0 = 
1
4π
 In the above expression of spherical harmonics (angular part of the 
wavefunction) for 1s and 3s orbital, there is no term containing either of 
the angles (θ, φ). Thus, there is no angular dependence and thus s-orbital 
is spherical in shape.386 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy
 10. Show that probability of finding 2pz
 in xy plane is zero.
 Ans. For 2pz
 orbital, angular wavefunction is written as
 Y1,0 = 
6
2
1
2
cos θ
π
× = 
3
4π
cos ~ θ θ cos [Refer Table 7.7]
 From this expression, it is seen that shape of 2pz
orbital depends on angle 
θ only.
 When θ = 0°, cos 0° = 1 and when θ = 90°, cos 90° = 0.
 Thus, when we put cos 90° = 0 in the above expression, then Y1,0 = 0 i.e.
in the xy plane, the probability of finding 2pz
 electron is zero and hence xy
plane is a nodal plane for 2pz
 orbital. The charge is distributed above and 
below this plane.

7.6.4 Total Wavefunction of Hydrogen Atom
The total wavefunction, ψ, of hydrogen atom is expressed as a product of 
three functions. One of these depends only on distance (r), called the radial 
wavefunction. The other two depend on the direction of θ and φ, called the 
angular wavefunction.
 ψl,m,n(r, θ, φ) = R r n l, ,

Here, Rn,l(r) represents the radial wavefunction and Yl,m(θ, φ) is spherical

7.8 MAGNETIC PROPERTIES: ANGULAR MOMENTUM AND 
MAGNETIC MOMENT
7.8.1 Classical Expression of Magnetic Moment due to Orbital 
Motion of Electron
When an electric current is allowed to flow in a loop of wire, a magnetic field 
is generated in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the loop. The loop will 
now act as a magnet. The magnitude of the magnetic moment of magnet is given 
by Ampere’s law or Law of Biot and Savart, 
mm
 = I × A …(7.40)
where, I is the current circulating in the loop per unit time and A is the area of 
cross-section of the loop.
According to classical mechanics, the electron in an atom undergoes two 
types of motion:
 (a) orbital motion around the nucleus.
 (b) spin motion around its own axis.
Each electron being a charged particle and undergoing orbital motion can be 
considered as a small loop of current which posses a magnetic moment. So, each 
electron in an atom behaves like a small magnet which creates a magnetic field.
Suppose, there is an electron with charge ‘–e’, moving with a linear velocity 
‘v’, in a circular orbit of radius ‘r’. The current ‘I’ circulating in the orbit will 
be given as

Let ‘A’ is the area of cross-section of the orbit and is given by

Thus, the magnetic moment due to orbital motion associated with the 
electron, acting as a small magnet, can be determined by substituting eq. (7.41) 
and eq. (7.42) in eq. (7.40):

vr, is the total orbital angular momentum of the electron and 
factor ‘g’ is known as the gyromagnetic ratio.
Both total orbital angular momentum (L) and magnetic moment due to 
orbital motion (mm
) are vector quantities. From the above eq. (7.43), it is seen that
(mm
) ∝ (–L)
the magnetic moment due to orbital 
motion (mm
) has a direction opposite 
to that of the total orbital angular 
momentum (L) because of the 
negative charge on the electron. 
Both the quantities are directed 
along the direction of the magnetic 
field generated or magnetic axis i.e., 
perpendicular to the current loop.
Thus classically, one should 
expect that magnetic moment should 
make all possible angles with any 
chosen direction.

, is known as Bohr magneton and its value is

.
From expression (7.44), it is seen that total orbital angular momentum (L) 
is quantised i.e., total orbital angular momentum does not point in any direction 
in space but points only along certain directions. 
Let the direction of the magnetic field is taken to be z-axis, and the 
component of total orbital angular momentum along the z-axis, ML
 is given as
ML
 = m
h
l
2π






 …(7.46)
where, ml
 is the magnetic quantum number and can take (2l + 1) different integral 
values in the range –l ≤ ml
≤ +l.
If θ is the angle between the total orbital angular momentum vector and 
the z-axis, then z-component of total orbital angular momentum of the electron 
is given by
 ML
 = L cos θ
 ML
 = l l h
( ) + ⋅ 1 cos

2π




or l l( ) +1 cos θ = ml
 …(7.48)
This equation clearly demonstrates that | ml
 | cannot exceed | l |, otherwise 
cos θ becomes greater than ±1. This equation also demonstrates that when
ml
 = ±l, cos θ does not equal to ±1 and therefore, the axis of rotation never 
coincides with the z-axis. In other words, total orbital angular momentum can 
never be aligned along the magnetic axis and hence it will always be oriented 
with respect to the z-axis.
Since the magnetic moment due to orbital motion (mm
) has a direction 
opposite to that of total orbital angular momentum vector (L), thus like total 
orbital angular momentum, the magnetic moment due to orbital motion will 
also be directed along certain directions in space such that 
mz
 = mm
 cos θ …(7.49)406 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy
Thus, magnetic moment due to orbital motion (mm
) can never be aligned 
along the magnetic axis and hence it will always be oriented with respect to 
the z-axis. Similar to orbital angular momentum, there are (2l + 1) different 
components of magnetic moment.
Thus, quantum mechanically, magnetic moment should not make all possible 
angles with any chosen direction. But, the magnetic moment and hence the 
electronic orbits can make only certain discrete orientations in space. This is 
known as the space quantisation of electronic orbits.
For l = 1, 2l + 1 = 3, the three allowed orientations of orbital angular 
momentum and the magnetic moment are shown in Fig. 7.45.

7.8.3 Potential Energy Due to Orbital Motion of an Electron in 
a Magnetic Field: Larmor Precession
The magnetic moment which have certain discrete orientation in space refer 
to the same energy in the absence of an external magnetic field. If we place 
an electron in an external magnetic field, H, then the potential energy, V, of an 
electron is7.8 Magnetic Properties: Angular Momentum and Magnetic Moment 407
 V = –Hmz
Using eq. (7.49):
 V = –H(mm
cos θ)
Using eq. (7.45):
 V = − − H l [ ( β θ l +1)] cos
 V = H l β θ [ (l +1) cos ]
Using eq. (7.48):
 V = Hβml
So the potential energy of an electron depends on the value of ml
.
Thus, the energy, En
, of the electron in any particular orbital in the presence 
of magnetic field gets modified to E′
n
 E′
n 
= En
 + Hβml
where, En
 = energy of electron in the absence of magnetic field
and E′
n 
= energy of electron in the presence of magnetic field.
Actually, in the presence of magnetic field, the magnetic moment vector 
executes larmor precession around the magnetic field. The magnetic moment 
experiences a coupled force which tends to align the vector along the field 
direction. Classically, this alignment is permitted but quantum mechanically 
this is not possible. The only other effect of this force is to rotate the magnetic 
moment vector around the field direction.
Due to this external magnetic field, the magnetic moment vectors which 
have the different orientations, now have different energies determined by the 
quantum number ‘ml
’.
Like: 
 1. Energy of Electron in s-orbital: Since for s-orbital, ml
 = 0, thus the energy 
of electron in s-orbital remains unaffected in the presence of an external 
magnetic field. This is also because of the fact that the orbital angular 
momentum of electron in s-orbital is zero and hence its magnetic moment 
is also zero. In other words, the motion of electron in s-orbital is such that 
it does not produce any magnetic dipole and thus no interaction with the 
external magnetic field can takes place.408 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy
2. Energy of Electron in p-orbital: Since for p-orbital, l = 1 and permitted 
values of ml
 are +1, 0 and –1. The energy of electron in p-orbital in the 
presence of external magnetic field becomes:
ml
 = +1, E′
n 
= En
+ Hβ
 ml
 = 0, E′
n 
= En
 ml
 = –1, E′
n 
= En
– Hβ
Hence, the degeneracy of the p-orbitals are removed in the presence of a 
magnetic field as shown in Fig. 7.47.

3. Energy of Electron in d-orbital: Since for d-orbital, l = 2 and permitted 
values of ml
 are +2, +1, 0, –1 and –2. The energy of electron in d-orbital 
in the presence of external magnetic field becomes

7.8.4 Zeeman Effect
Zeeman in 1986 observed that many of the spectral lines of an atom split into 
more than one line when placed in a magnetic field. This effect is known as 
Zeeman effect. This can be explained on the basis of fact that there is removal 
of degeneracy of orbitals in the presence of magnetic field.
Like: In the absence of magnetic field, the transition from any one of three 
2p orbitals to 1s orbital produces the same spectral line. This is because in the 
absence of magnetic field, all the three 2p orbitals have same energy i.e., degenerate.
But in the presence of magnetic field, this degeneracy is removed and three 
spectral lines are seen in the above transition from 2p to 1s orbital.
The three transitions are: 1s ←2p+1, 1s ←2p0 and 1s ←2p–1 as shown in 
Fig. 7.49.

7.8.5 Anomalous Zeeman Effect
When the Zeeman effect is examined under high resolution microscope, the 
above spectrum is found to be more complicated. In fact, a spectral line which 
appears to be a single one, actually consists of many lines closely placed to each 
other. Like: All the three transitions 1s ←2p+1, 1s ←2p0 and 1s ←2p–1 shown 
in Fig. 7.49, are actually made up of two closely packed lines. The existence of 
double lines instead of a single line is also observed in the spectra for the alkali 
metals even in the absence of a magnetic field.
7.8.6 Explanation of Anomalous Zeeman Effect: SpinQuantum 
Number
In order to explain the existence of doublet (double lines) in the spectra of alkali 
metals, the following explanations was given as follows:
Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck in 1925 proposed that instead of orbital motion 
around the nucleus, the electron also possess spinning motion about its own axis. 
Thus electron has an intrinsic angular momentum due to spinning about its own 
axis i.e., spin angular momentum. The value of the spin angular momentum is 
independent of the orbital angular momentum. Just as orbital motion and orbital 
angular momentum is described by two orbital quantum numbers: l and ml
, the 
spinning motion and thus spin angular momentum can be described by two spin 
quantum numbers: ‘s’ and ‘ms
’.
The spin angular momentum quantum number ‘s’ represents the magnitude 
of the total spin angular momentum S and spin quantum number ‘ms
’ represents 
the z-component of the total spin angular momentum Ms
 such that
 S = s s

and Ms



 …(7.51) [Same as eq. (7.46)]
Let z-axis is direction of the magnetic field. If θ is the angle between the 
total spin angular momentum and the z-axis, then z-component of the total spin 
angular momentum of the electron is given by
 Ms 
= S cos θ
 Ms 
= s s

The allowed values of ms
 are: –s, –(s – 1), … (s – 1), s
But it is found that the spin angular momentum quantum number ‘s’, has 
only one value of 1/2.
Thus, the only permitted values of ms
 are +1/2 and –1/2.
Hence, the z-component of the total spin angular momentum is given by 
i.e., eq. (7.51) becomes:

i.e., only two orientations of the total spin angular momentum are possible. Thus, 
total spin angular momentum vector can never be aligned along the magnetic axis 
and hence it will always be oriented with respect to z-axis as shown in Fig. 7.50.

Since the magnetic moment vector has a direction opposite to that of angular 
momentum vector, thus like angular momentum, the magnetic moment vector 
will also be directed along certain directions in space such that 
mz
 = m cos θ …(7.54)
Thus, magnetic moment vector can never be aligned along the magnetic 
axis and hence it always be oriented with respect to z-axis.
7.8.7 Magnetic Moment Due to Spinning Motion of Electron
According to classical mechanics, like orbital motion, the spinning motion of 
the electron is also associated with the magnetic moment vector opposite to 
that of total spin angular momentum vector. 412 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy
The relation between magnetic moment due to spinning motion (m) and the 
total spin angular momentum is
 m = –2gS …(7.55)
where, S = total spin angular momentum and ‘g’ is gyromagnetic ratio g



. The factor 2 in the above equation (7.55) has been added on the basis of 
experimental evidence and implies that the spinning of electron is twice is large 
as that of the orbital motion of the electron.
Now, according to quantum mechanics, the magnitude of the total spin 
angular momentum of the electron is given by eq. (7.50)
i.e. S = s s

7.8.8 Potential Energy Due to Spinning Motion of Electron in a 
Magnetic Field
In we place an electron in an external magnetic field, H, then the potential 
energy, V, of an electron is
 V = –Hmz
using eq. (7.54):
 V = –H(m cos θ)
using eq. (7.56):

 V = 2 1 H s β θ [ (s + ) cos ]7.8 Magnetic Properties: Angular Momentum and Magnetic Moment 413
Using eq. (7.53):
 V = 2Hβms
Thus, potential energy of the electron depends on the value of ms
. Since the 
only permitted values of ms
 are +1/2 and –1/2, thus we will have:
 (i) ms

 (ii) ms

Earlier, due to orbital motion of electron in any particular orbital in the 
presence of magnetic field, the energy En
, of the electron has been modified to 
E′
n
. Now, considering the spin motion of electron in the presence of magnetic 
field, the energy E′
n 
has been further modified to E″
n
.
 E′
n 
= En
 + Hβml
 E″
n 
= E′
n 
+ 2Hβms
Thus, E″
n 
= (En
 + Hβml
) + 2Hβms
where, En
is the energy of electron in the absence of magnetic field.
Hβml
 = potential energy due to the orbital motion of electron
 2Hβms
 = potential energy due to the spinning motion of electron
Like: 
 1. Energy of Electron in s-orbital: Since for s-orbital, ml
 = 0, thus the 
potential energy due to orbital motion of electron is zero. But since, ms
can have two values, +1/2 and –1/2, the energy of electron is s-orbital gets 
modified as:
E″
n
 = (En
 + Hβml
) + 2Hβms
E″
n
 = En
 + 2Hβms
 (because, ml
 = 0)
when ms
 = +1/2; E″
n
 = En
 + Hβ
and ms
 = –1/2; E″
n
 = En
 – Hβ
2. Energy of Electron in p-orbital: Since for p-orbital, l = 1 and permitted 
values of ml
 are +1, 0 and –1. For each value of ml
, there are two values 
of ms
i.e., +1/2 and –1/2.
 Thus, here we can have the following combinations:
 (i) ml
 = +1, ms
= +1/2 E″
n
 = En
 + Hβ + Hβ = En
 + 2Hβ
 (ii) ml
 = +1, ms
 = –1/2 E″
n
 = En
 + Hβ – Hβ = En
 (iii) ml
 = 0, ms
= +1/2 E″
n
 = En
 + 0 + Hβ = En
 + Hβ
 (iv) ml
 = 0, ms
= –1/2 E″
n
 = En
 + 0 – Hβ = En
 – Hβ414 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy
 (v) ml
 = –1, ms
= +1/2 E″
n
 = En
 – Hβ + Hβ = En
 (vi) ml
 = –1, ms
= –1/2 E″
n
 = En
 – Hβ – Hβ = En
 – 2Hβ
This would explain the fact that why under high resolution microscope, 
the spectrum for transition from 2p to 1s orbital (shown in Fig. 7.49) is found 
to be more complicated. A spectral line which appears to be single line, under 
high resolution microscope consists of many lines closely placed to each other.

7.8.9 Experimental Demonstration of Electron Spin: Stern￾Gerlach Experiment
Stern and Gerlach experimentally demonstrates the existence of the electron 
spin. In their experiment, they passed a beam of silver atoms through a strong 
magnetic field and found that the beam splits symmetrically in two directions

Fig. 7.52. Experimental Demonstration of electron spin.
This experimental observation can be explained on the basis of the fact 
that the silver atom has a single s-electron (Ag = [Kr]4d
105s
1
) in its valence 
shell. For the inner electrons, the total orbital and spin magnetic moments are 
zero. Since the outermost electron is present in s-orbital, m = 0, this its orbital 
magnetic moment is zero but it has two values of spin magnetic moment i.e.,
ms
= +1/2 and –1/2. So, obviously, this splitting must be due to two specific 
interactions between the spin magnetic moment possessed by the silver atom 
and the external magnetic field.

Problems based on magnetic ProPerties
 1. The electronic transition 1s ← 2p in an atom is split into more than one 
transition when viewed in the presence of magnetic field. Explain. 
Ans. In the absence of magnetic field, all the three 2p orbitals have same 
energy and thus transition from any one of three 2p orbitals to 1s orbital 
produces the same spectral line.
E2p+1
 = E2p0
 = E2p–1
 (absence of magnetic field)416 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy
 But in the presence of magnetic field, this degeneracy is removed and three 
spectral lines are seen in the above transition from 2p to 1s orbital.
E2p+1
≠ E2p0
≠ E2p–1
 (presence of magnetic field)
 The three transitions are:
 1s ← 2p+1, 1s ← 2p0
 and 1s ← 2p–1
 2. What is normal Zeeman effect? Discuss in detail how it is explained using 
quantum theory.
 Ans. Zeeman Effect: The splitting of spectral lines of an atom into more 
than one line when placed in a magnetic field is known as Zeeman effect.
 This can be explained on the basis of fact that there is removal of degeneracy 
of orbitals in the presence of magnetic field. Thus the number of transitions 
increases and hence the number of spectral lines also increases.
 3. Show that l(l +1) cos θ = ml

momentum vector and z-axis.

 4. What is the energy of the electron in 4s orbital in the presence of external 
magnetic field?
 Ans. For any s-orbital (1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, …), ml
 = 0, thus the energy of electron 
in s-orbital remains unaffected in the presence of an external magnetic field. 
This is also because of the fact that the angular momentum of electron 
in s-orbital is zero and hence its magnetic moment is also zero. In other 
words, the motion of electron in s-orbital is such that it does not produce 
any magnetic dipole and thus no interaction with the external magnetic 
field can take place.
 5. Find the angle made by angular momentum vector of an electron due to 
its orbital motion in px

7.9 SPIN-ORBIT COUPLING AND TERM SYMBOLS
 1. Orbital Angular momentum: Angular momentum is a vector quantity. 
It always have zero or positive value and never negative.
 An electron moving in its orbital around the nucleus possesses an angular 
momentum called as orbital angular momentum. A measure of orbital 
angular momentum of an electron is given by ‘l’ values corresponding to 
the orbital called orbital angular momentum quantum number.
 A given angular momentum vector (l) has (2l + 1) orientations in space 
about any given reference direction. These orientations are representated 
in terms of magnetic quantum number (m or ml
)
ml
 = +l ...o...–l
 When two or more electrons are present in a subshell of an atom, their 
individual orbital angular momentum may add together or oppose each 
other. The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is given 
by L value.
 If there are two electrons in a subshell with orbital angular momentum 
quantum number ‘l
1
’ and ‘l
2
’ respectively. The value of L is obtained by 
coupling the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers by 
using the Clebsch-Gordan series.

 The total orbital angular momentum has (2L + 1) orientation in space about 
any given reference direction (z-component).
 These orientations are represented by the quantum number ML
.
 The ML
 value varies from
ML
 = L, L – 1, L – 2, …0, … –L [Using the maximum L value]
 Also, ML = Sml
.
2. Spin Angular Momentum: An electron in an atom is not only moving 
about the nucleus but also spinning about its own axis. The spinning 
motion of an electron generates an angular momentum called spin angular 
momentum which is measured in terms of spin angular momentum 
quantum number (s).
 A given spin angular momentum vector (s) has (2s + 1) orientations in space 
about any given reference direction. These orientations are represented in 
terms of spin quantum number (ms
).
 The values of ms
 are +
1
2
 and −
1

 only. 
 When two or more electrons are present in a subshell of an atom, their 
individual spin angular momentum may add together or oppose each other. 
The total spin angular momentum quantum number is given by S value.
 If there are two electrons in a subshell with spin angular momentum 
quantum number s
1
 and s
2
 respectively. The value of S is obtained by 
coupling the individual spin angular momentum quantum number by using 
the Clebsch-Gordon series.
 S = s

 The total spin angular momentum has (2S + 1) orientations in space about 
any given reference direction (z-component).
 These orientations are represented by the quantum number Ms
.
 The Ms
 value varies from
Ms
 = S, S – 1, S – 2, …, – S [usig the maximum S value]
Also, Ms
 = Sms
 The (2S + 1) is the spin multiplicity of the term.
 3. Spin-Orbit Coupling: The interaction of orbital angular momentum with 
spin angular momentum of an electron is called spin-orbit coupling.
 If there are two or more electrons in a subshell, there is coupling of all the 
orbital and all the spin angular momentum.
 There are two ways by which the coupling of spin and orbital angular 
momentum takes place.7.9 Spin-Orbit Coupling and term symbols 421
 (i) L–S coupling or Russel-Saunders Coupling: L–S coupling occurs in 
atoms of low atomic number where spin-orbit coupling is weak.
 First sum all the orbital angular momentum to give a total L and then 
sum all the spin angular momentum to give a total S separately.
 Then finally add these two angular momenta to give the total angular 
momentum quantum number (J).
L = Sl
i
; S = Ss
i
 J = L + S
 Again this coupling is vectorial given by Clebsch-Gordon series.
J = | L + S | , L + S – 1, L + S – 2, … | L – S |.
 It is to note that
 (a) If L > S
 Number of possible J values = (2S + 1)
 (b) If L = S
 Number of possible J values = (2S + 1)
 (c) If L > S
 Number of possible J values = (2L + 1)
 (d) If we have L = 0, then only one value of J, given by J = S.
 (ii) j – j Coupling: It occurs in heavy atoms where spin-orbit coupling is 
large. In this the orbital and spin angular momentum of each electron are 
coupled strongly individually to give the individual angular momentum 
for each electron.
 ji
 = li
 + si
 Then the sum of individual angular momentum of each electron is taken 
to give total angular momentum quantum number (J).
J = Sj
i
 4. Microstates: The complete description of arrangement of electrons in a 
subshell of an atom, ion or molecule cannot be done by just giving the 
electronic configuration.
 For a given electronic configuration, there are several ways of arrangement 
of electrons in a subshell. The different ways in which the electrons can 
be arranged in the orbitals of a subshell are called microstates of the 
configuration.

5. Term symbol or spectroscopic terms: All the microstates of a given 
electronic configuration have the same energy, if the inter-electronic 
repulsions are very small. Since the atoms and molecules have compact 
structure, these, inter-electronic repulsions are very strong and cannot 
be ignored. Due to these inter-electronic respulsions, microstates have 
different energies. The microstates having same energy are grouped 
together, and is called state or terms.7.9 Spin-Orbit Coupling and term symbols 423

 (e) Determine the Ground State Term: Hund’s Rule:
 Once the terms are obtained, the ground state term (term of lowest energy) 
is obtained by using Hund’s Rule, since the terms derived for an electronic 
configuration have different energies.
 The various rules involved in determining the ground state term are:
 Rule 1: For a given configuration, the term with the highest spin multiplicity 
(or largest S value) is the most stable. Thus, the ground state has the 
maximum number of unpaired electrons, hence minimum repulsion and 
maximum exchange energy.
 Example: In p
2
-configuration, the term with highest spin multiplicity is 3.
 (i.e., triplet P2,1,0 term). Therefore, 3P2,1,0 is the ground state term.
 Rule 2: If two or more terms have the same spin multiplicity value, then 
the term having largest ‘L’ value will be the most stable term.
 Example: In p
2
-configuration, both 1D2
 and 1S0
 terms are singlet with the 
same spin multiplicity. But, 1D2
 has lower energy than 1S0
 because the one 
with larger L value has lower energy
 1D2
 has L = 2
and 1S0
 has L = 0
\ 1D2
 < 1S0
.
 Rule 3: If two or more terms have same S and L values, in that case:
(a) If the subshell is half filled or less than half filled, the term or state 
having smallest or lowest J value will be the most stable term.
 Example: In p
2
-configuration, the subshell is less than half filled. 
Thus for the ground state term i.e. 3P2,1,0 having same L and S values, 
the three terms are arranged according to the J values.
\ 3P0
 < 3P1
 < 3P2
 (b) If the subshell is more than half filled, the term or state having largest 
J value is most stable.
• Thus, for p
2
-configuration, the term symbols are arranged in the increasing 
order of energies using Hund’s Rule as follows:
 3P0
 < 3P1
 < 3P2
 < 1D2

 Thus, all the 10 possible electronic arrangements are represented by the

 (e) Determine the ground state term: Applying Hund’s rule (Rule 3) i.e.,
if two or more terms have same S and L values and if the subshell is less

most state term.
 Thus, on comparing 2D3/2 and 2D5/2, the 2D3/2 is the ground state as it has

 But one thing is different, that is if we are finding the term symbols in

-case, the ground state term symbol is 3P0
. But in p

-case, (p

-case same 
as p

. But it is not so, the 
ground state term symbol for p

-case is 3P2
 because in p

is more than half-filled and ground state should have highest J value.
 Similarly, for d

. But in case of d

(d

it is not so, the ground state term symbol for d

-case is 3F4
 because in d

highest J value.
 2. If a subshell is fully-filled (i.e., closed subshell) like p

the term symbol will be 1S0
. This is because for these cases,

 We cannot see any other arrangement of electrons except one arrangement.
direct method to determine the ground
state term symbol for atoms
Following steps are used to identify the ground state term symbols:
 (a) Identify the microstate (arrangement of electrons) that has the highest 
value of S
 (b) Determine the maximum value of S and find out the spin multiplicity 
(2S + 1)
 (c) Determine the maximum value of L and find out the state level.
 (d) Select the maximum value of J for more than half filled subshell and 
minimum value of J for less than half filled subshell.434 Chapter 7 “Hydrogen Atom”: Quantisation of Electronic Energy

rrr8.1 INTRODUCTION
After finding the quantum mechanical solution for energy and wavefunction of 
hydrogen atom (and one electron systems like He+
, Li2+, etc.) in the previous 
chapter. We now, need to find the solution for multielectron atoms (atoms with 
two or more electrons). Simply multiplying the energy of hydrogen, EH
(one 
electron system) with the number of electrons in case of multielectron atom 
will give inaccurate result. As, it was seen that
 EHe ≠ 2EH
 (Q He is containing two electrons)
or ELi ≠ 3EH
 (Q Li is containing three electrons)
This is because with an addition of an electron to the one electron system, 
a new electron-electron repulsion term is introduced in the Hamiltonian.

For multielectron atom containing n electrons, the energy cannot be 
calculated as
 Emultielectron atom = nEH
 (where, n is the number of electrons)
Therefore, in such calculations we have ignored the electron-electron 
repulsion term (which is not present in hydrogen atom Hamiltonian). Therefore, 
we need to solve for multielectron atoms using some other method.
In previous chapter that, Schrodinger equation for one electron systems 
(Hydrogen atom and Hydrogen like ions) can be solved exactly in quantum 
mechanics. However, even one electron systems have complex and lengthy 
calculations to be solved. But if an atom possesses more than one electron then 
Multielectron System and 
Approximate Methods
8440 Chapter 8 Multielectron System and Approximate Methods
exact solution of such multielectron atoms becomes difficult. The major 
challenge to the exact solution is the term arising due to the interaction of 
electrons with one another. The potential energy term e
r
2





 arising due to 
electron-electron repulsion term in the Hamiltonian is the problematic term for 
the exact solution. We cannot even neglect the important electron-electron 
repulsion term, as its exclusion gives the inaccurate calculations for the system. 
If an atom or molecule has many electrons, which interact with one another, 
then the solution becomes rather impossible.
To solve such multielectron atoms, some approximations are taken 
into account which do not disturb the result enough, and helps solving the 
Schrodinger equation for the system completely. They are called as approximate 
methods. Approximate methods fall basically into three categories:
 1. Pertubation method (time independent)
 2. Variation method
 3. Self consistent field method.
8.2 PERTUBATION METHOD
Time independent pertubation theory is applicable to systems having 
non-degenerate energy states. In the pertubation method, the electronic repulsion 
terms are considered as small pertubations on the hamiltonian operator (which 
neglects the electron-electron repulsion terms called as pertubation terms) i.e.,

Assuming that these small pertubations do not change the wavefunction (ψ0
) 
very much, where ψ0
 is the eigen function of the given state excluding the 
repulsion terms. We can calculate an approximate value of energy by employing 
the expectation expression.
According to pertubation method, the Schrodinger equation is written as

E0

 corresponds to those systems which can be exactly solved and 
rest of the terms are the pertubation terms.
Similarly,
 Ĥ = Ĥ0
 + λH(1) + λ
2H(2) + … [8.4(c)]
[as in equations (8.1) and (8.2)]
where Ĥ0
 is part of Hamiltonian operator which can be solved exactly and rest 
of the terms are pertubation Hamiltonian operator terms. These pertubation 
terms create problem in solving Schrodinger equation for multielectron systems.
For example in He-atom, the Hamiltonian occurs for one nuclei and two 
electron system, possessing three kinetic energy terms for each along with two; 
electron with nuclei attraction potential energy term, till here He-atom is exactly 
solvable, possessing Ĥ0
 form. But in addition to these terms He-atom also 
possess electron-electron repulsion term (which form pertubation Hamiltonian 
operator terms).

While solving Pertubation theorem we neglect 2nd order and further higher 
order terms, else solution to the theorem becomes very difficult. Therefore, we 
consider only Ist order Pertubation terms. Hence, equation reduces as

En

According to exactly solvable Schrodinger equation 
 Ĥ0ψ0
 = E0ψ0
 …(8.8)
Hence, equation (8.3) can be written as
 Ĥψn

 (Ĥ0

Since λ itself is very small, therefore λ

 will be further small. Hence, 
pertubation terms corresponding to λ
2
 are very small in magnitude and can be 
neglected.
\ We have,
 Ĥ0ψ0

 = E0ψ0

Also, Ĥ0ψ0

However, the experimental value for EHe = –78.88 eV. The huge difference 
(~ 30 eV) is calculated and experimental value of EHe is because of the 
neglected electron-electron repulsion term. Therefore, we need to apply second

The above calculated value is in good agreement with the experimental 
EHe = –78.8 eV. Hence, we can solve for He atom by applying pertubation 
method. 8.3 Variation Method 449
8.3 VARIATION METHOD
The variation method is an approximate method based on variation theorem, 
which is a way of checking and improving the guesses in the form of trial 
wavefunctions (ψtrial) for the complex systems whose exact solution is not 
possible.
The suitable trial wavefunction is chosen and it is assumed to be the solution 
of Schrodinger equation. However, the chosen trial wavefunction may not 
necessarily be the eigen function of the Schrodinger equation but it must be as 
close as possible to the true wavefunction. The trial wavefunction is written 
containing a few adjustable parametres, hence we calculate the energy of the 
system (Ea
) with trial wavefunction. The trial energy (Ea
) corresponding to the 
trial wavefunction is calculated as:
 Ea
 = 
trial trial
trial trial
* ˆ
*
H d op
d
ψ ⋅ ⋅ψ ⋅ τ
ψ ⋅ψ ⋅ τ
∫
∫
 = 
trial trial
trial trial
ˆ
|
Hop 〈ψ | | ψ 〉
〈ψ ψ 〉
where Ea
≥ E0
 (Exact ground state energy).
If the trial wavefunction is normalised then the denominator of the above 
equation reduces to unity (condition for normalisation) and hence Ea
 becomes
 Ea
 = trial trial
* ˆ
∫
ψ ⋅ ⋅ψ ⋅ τ H d op = trial trial
ˆHop 〈ψ | | ψ 〉
It is mandatory that under any condition the trial energy (Ea
) should be 
always greater or equal to the exact ground state energy (E0
).
When the trial wavefunction matches the true wavefunction then
 Ea
 = E0
else trial energy corresponding to the trial wavefunction is always greater than 
the exact ground state energy corresponding to the true wavefunction. Hence,
 Ea
 > E0
Hence, combining the two equations we get
 Ea
≥ E0
However, if a number of guesses (trials) are made with corresponding trial 
energies (Ea
) as E E a a E E a a 1 2 3 4
, , , ..... etc. Then, selection of the better trial 
wavefuncttion goes to the corresponding trial energy which follows the two 
conditions, they are:
 (a) Ea
≥ E0
 (b) If a set of trial energies follow the above condition (Ea
≥ E0
) then further 
selection is done by choosing the energy closest to the E0
 (exact ground 
state energy).450 Chapter 8 Multielectron System and Approximate Methods

In variation method, the energy is always written in terms of adjustable 
parameters, the best trial energy (Ea
) can be obtained by minimizing the value 
of Ea
 (by taking the first derivative of Ea
 with respect to adjustable parameter 
and equating the resultant to zero). Minimizing the Ea
, brings it as close as 
possible to the true energy of the system.

8.4 SELF-CONSISTENT FIELD METHOD
We have seen that both the approximation methods applied previously (namely 
Pertubation method and Variation method) on the simplest multielectron atom 
i.e. He atom with two electrons only did not give exact results. 
However, the calculated values for energy were in good agreement with 
the experimental values. Hence, for atoms with large number of electrons as 
the interelectronic repulsion terms will increase in the Hamiltonian, the two  8.4 Self-Consistent Field Method 465
methods (Pertubation method and Variation method) will not be able to give 
exact solutions. This proved need for more powerful method of calculation 
of ground state energy and wavefunction for multielectron atoms (with high 
number of electrons).
In 1928, the British Physicist D.R. Hartree suggested that the wavefunctions 
of n-electron atom can be written as product of ‘n’ one-electron wavefunctions 
 ψ(1, 2, 3, …, n) = φ1
(1) · φ2
(2) · φ3
(3) … φn
(n)
where φi
(i) are normalised and mutually orthogonal wavefunctions, where,
i
th electron occupies the atomic orbital φi
.
According to the self consistent field method each electron is assumed to 
move in a spherically symmetrical potential due to the nucleus and the average 
potential of all the electrons except the one under consideration.

rrr9.1 INTRODUCTION
Heitler and London in 1927 gave the description of the chemical bond, which 
turned out to be a great early achievement of quantum mechanics. Prior to this 
time it was impossible to explain why two hydrogen atoms come together to form 
a stable chemical bond. It was later seen that existence of a stable chemical bond 
was a quantum mechanical effect. The simplest molecule forming a chemical 
bond is hydrogen molecule, formed due to bonding between two hydrogen 
atoms. We shall discuss hydrogen molecule and hydrogen molecule ion in detail 
since most of the ideas and techniques developed for hydrogen molecule will 
be applicable to more complex molecules.
The hydrogen atoms each containing one electron in a hydrogen molecule 
bond together to form the simplest covalent bond, in which the two hydrogens 
share the two electrons (each from hydrogen atom).

The qualitative picture for the formation of a covalent bond was provided 
by G.N. Lewis followed by Langmuir, who described a covalent bond formation 
due to the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. This sharing of electron 
pairs help each atom acquire a stable electronic configuration. The stability of 
a diatomic molecule with respect to the individual atoms can be understood 
qualitatively on the basis of electrostatic interactions. The shared electron pair 
lies in the central region of the two atoms. This arrangement besides decreasing 
the electrostatic repulsion between the two nuclei, results in the maximum 
interaction between the nuclei and electrons. Consequently, in a molecule the 
electrostatic attraction terms predominates over the repulsion terms which result 
in the release of energy when a molecule is formed from the atoms. Thus, a 
molecule is energetically more stable than the individual atoms.
Chemical Bonding
9468 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding
The quantitative aspects for the formation of the covalent bond have been 
provided by quantum mechanics. According to quantum mechanics, a covalent 
molecule may be described by means of a wavefunction which describes the 
behaviour of the electrons under the influence of all nuclei in the molecule 
and all other electrons in the molecule. Thus, in principle all that we have to 
do is to write the Schrodinger wave equation for the molecule and then solve 
this equation for various allowed eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. However, 
like many electron atoms, only approximate methods can be applied to solve 
the Schrodinger equation. Various approaches have been developed for the 
approximate solution of Schrodinger equation, of which the two approaches 
have been widely used, namely
 (a) Valence bond theory (VBT):
 Developed by Heitler and London, Slater and Pauling.
 (b) Molecular orbital theory (MOT)
 Developed by Hund, Mulliken, Lennard-Jones and Huckel.
9.2 BORN-OPPENHEIMER APPROXIMATION
Whether we deal with the valence bond (VB) or molecular orbital (MO) approach 
we have to deal with electrons and nuclei. Since the electron is a light particle 
compared to the mass of a proton (the mass of a proton is 1836 times as heavy 
as the mass of an electron), the nuclei are expected to move much more slowly 
than the electrons. The electrons in a molecule may have an average distribution 
over a time during which the nuclei hardly moves.
This argument was first put forward by Born and Oppenheimer in 1927.
This means that the vibrational and rotational motions of a molecule are 
separable from the electronic motions.
Before taking up the VB and MO theories, we shall first treat the Born￾Oppenheimer approximation in wave mechanical terms.
It is an important approximation while discussing the wavefunction of the 
molecule. Schrodinger equation of molecule is given as:
 Hψ(r, R) = Eψ(r, R)
where, ψ depends on coordinates of electron (r) and coordinates of nucleus (R).
This Schrodinger equation cannot be solved exactly for a molecule and 
hence Born-Oppenhiemer approximation was used.
According to this approximation, the nucleus is 1836 times more heavy as 
compared to electron, therefore, for most practical purposes we neglect motion 
of nuclei while considering electronic motion. As nucleus is stationary, therefore, 
called stationary nuclei approximation or fixed nucleus approximation.9.2 Born-Oppenheimer Approximation 469
This approximation decreases the complexity of molecular wave equation. The 
Hamiltonian for molecule is very complex as it includes many terms. Thus, kinetic 
energy of nucleus A and kinetic energy of nucleus B in a molecule AB is neglected. 
So, the term representing the nuclear motion in the Hamiltonian operator can 
be removed with the help of Born-Oppenheimer Approximation. 
Hence, the translational energy of the molecule as a whole may be 
considered separately and while evaluating the electronic energy, the various 
nuclei may be considered fixed in space with constant internuclear distances. 
The significance of this approximation will be of utmost importance for the 
separation of electronic and nuclear motion, thus this approximation can separate 
out nuclear motion.
Quantum mechanically, the above approximation is achieved by writing the 
total wavefunction as the product of electronic wavefunction (ψe
) and the nuclear 
wavefunction (ψn
). The electronic wavefunction depends on the coordinates of 
electrons (r) as well as those of nuclei (R). The nuclear wavefunction depends 
only on the coordinates of nuclei (R).

9.3 APPROXIMATE METHODS TO SOLVE SCHRODINGER...
EQUATION OF A MOLECULE : VALENCE BOND 
APPROACH AND MOLECULAR ORBITAL APPROACH
• The valence bond (VB) approach, which was developed prior to the 
molecular orbital (MO) approach, is very similar to the classical chemical 
concept of valence bond between two atoms and to the electron-pair 
bond postulated by Lewis. In this method, the molecule is considered as 
a collection of atoms and then the interactions between different atoms 
are considered.
• Of these the concept of molecular orbital (MO) approach is most simple 
mathematically and therefore widely used for treatment of polyatomic 
molecules in chemistry. The general concept of molecular orbitals and 
of the building-up principle using molecular orbitals were developed in 
1927 by Hund and Mulliken and in 1929 by Lennard Jones. Their method 
of molecular orbitals is characterised by its fundamental simplicity 
and its ability to predict and explain certain chemical properties like 
paramagnetism of O2
 and NO and many other features of the structure 
and spectra of diatomic molecules with a reasonable degree of accuracy. 
More striking than these is the experimental verification of the energy 
ordering of the molecular orbitals (MO) of molecules.
Also in the molecular orbital approach, we look at the molecule as a 
collection of nuclei and electrons. We build up molecular orbitals for 
collection of nuclei and then asign electrons to them.
• The two approaches differ in the choice of trial wavefunctions whose 
parameters are then optimized by the variation method. In their 
elementary forms, both these methods give results that are crude from 
a quantitative point of view. However, both the methods can be refined 
by using better trial function. Both the methods, when carried up to their 
extreme refinements, produce identical results.472 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding
9.3.1 Valence Bond (VB) Approach
 • Postulates of Valence Bond (VB) Approach
 1. Covalent bonds are formed by the overlapping of half-filled atomic orbitals 
(A.O.) present in the valence shell of the atoms participating in bonding.
 2. The orbitals undergoing overlapping must have electronwith opposite spin.
 3. Overlapping of atomic orbitals results in the decrease of energy and 
formation of covalent bond.
 4. The strength of covalent bond depends upon the extent of overlapping. 
The greater the overlapping, more is the energy released and consequently 
stronger will be the covalent bond formed.

Thus, according to valence bond approach, after bond formation in O2
molecule there is no unpaired electron, thus O2
 is dimagnetic in nature. But when 
O2
 is poured between the poles of the magnet, it gets stucked in the magnetic 
poles, which shows the paramagnetic behaviour of O2
.474 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding
Therefore, another theory is developed to explain the paramagnetic 
behaviour of O2
 molecule i.e., molecular orbital (MO) approach.
9.3.2 Molecular Orbital (MO) Approach
 • Postulates of Molecular Orbital (MO) Approach
It was developed by F. Hund and R.S. Mullikan.
 1. All the electrons of both the atoms associated with the nuclei present in a 
molecule are taken.
 2. The electron is taken as a wave.
 3. The electrons in a molecule are present in the various molecular orbitals 
(MO) as the electrons of atoms are present in the various atomic orbitals 
(AO).
 4. Just as the electron probability distribution around a nucleus in an atom is 
given by an atomic orbital, the electron probability distribution around a 
group of nuclei in a molecule is given by a molecular orbital.
 5. The atomic orbitals of comparable energies and proper symmetry combine 
to form molecular orbitals.
 6. The number of molecular orbitals formed is equal to the number of 
combining atomic orbitals. When two atomic orbitals combine, two 
molecular orbitals are formed. One is known as Bonding Molecular 
Orbitals (BMO) and other is Antibonding Molecular Orbital (ABMO).
 7. The BMO has lower energy and hence greater stability than the 
corresponding ABMO.
 8. The molecular orbitals like atomic orbitals are filled in accordance with the 
Aufbau principle obeying the Pauli’s exclusion principle and the Hund’s 
Rule.
• Formation of Molecular Orbitals: Linear Combination of Atomic 
Orbitals (LCAO):
Atomic orbital is expressed by wavefunction (ψ), which represent the 
amplitude of the electron wave. These are obtained from the solution of 
Schrodinger wave equation.
Consider a homonuclear diatomic molecule consisting of two atoms 
A and B. The atomic orbitals of these atoms are represented by the 
wavefunctions ψA
 and ψB
. Mathematically, the formation of molecular 
orbitals are described by the linear combination of atomic orbitals that can 
take place by addition and by subtraction of wavefunction of individual 
atomic orbitals9.3 Approximate Methods to Solve Schrodinger... 475

2. The electron density in BMO is located 
between the nuclei of the bonded atoms 
because of which the repulsion between 
the nuclei is very less.
2. The electron density is located away 
from the space between the nuclei. 
Infact, there is a nodal plane (on which 
electron density is zero) between the 
nuclei and hence the repulsion between 
the nuclei is high.
3. Electrons placed in a BMO tend to 
hold the nuclei together and stabilise a 
molecule. Therefore, BMO possesses 
lower energy than either of the atomic 
orbitals that have combined to form it.
3. Electrons placed in AMBO 
destabilise the molecule. This is 
because the mutual repulsion of the 
electrons in this orbital is more than 
the attraction between the electrons 
and the nuclei, which causes net 
increase in energy.
4. Energy of BMO is lower than the 
energy of parent atomic orbitals that 
have combined.
4. Energy of ABMO is raised above 
the energy of the parent atomic 
orbitals that have combined476 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding
• Conditions for the combination of Atomic Orbitals:
 1. The combining atomic orbitals must have the same or nearly same 
energy.
 2. The combining atomic orbitals must have the same symmetry about 
the molecular axis.
 3. The combining atomic orbitals must overlap to the maximum extent.

 molecular is unstable and does not exist as bond order is zero.
 Note: Strengthening of the bond occurs due to the addition of electron in 
bonding molecular orbital or removal of the electron from antibonding 
molecular orbital.
 However, weakening of the bond occurs if an electron is added to 
the antibonding molecular orbital or it is removed from the bonding 
molecular orbital.
9.4 APPROXIMATION OF LINEAR COMBINATION OF 
ATOMIC ORBITALS: LCAO–MO TREATMENT
Each electron in a molecule is described by a wavefunction, known as the 
molecular orbital (MO). These molecular orbitals extend over the entire region 
of the molecule i.e., they are polycentric.
One of the most important ways of constructing molecular orbital is scheme 
based on the approximation of linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO).
The choice of LCAO can be explained by taking an example of a diatomic 
molecule AB
 (i) If the electron is in the neighbourhood of nucleus A, the influence of 
nucleus B is expected to be small. Hence, the ground-state molecular 
orbital (MO), in this region should be similar to the ground-state atomic 
orbital (AO) of atom A. Thus, the wavefunction can be represented as:
ψMO = C1
φA482 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding
 (ii) If the electron is in the neighbourhood of nucleus B, the molecular 
orbital (MO) will look like very similar to the atomic orbital (AO) of 
the atom B. Thus, the wavefunction can be represented as:
ψMO = C2
φB 
 (iii) If the electron is present anywhere in the molecule AB, then Hund and 
Mulliken suggested that wavefunction can be represented as:
ψMO = C1
φA
+ C2
φB 
 ψMO = wavefunction for molecular orbital
φA
, φB
 = wavefunction for atomic orbital
The, C1
 and C2
 are constants and are the weighing coefficients for the 
function φA
 and φB
. They are atomic orbital coefficient.
The C1
 and C2
 are chosen in such a manner that energy (E) is minimum.
In the extreme situations mentioned in (i) and (ii), we will have
C1
 = 1 and C2
 = 0; when the electron is near to nucleus A.
and C1
 = 0 and C2
 = 1; when the electron is near to nucleus B.
For any other situation, C1
 and C2
 may have identical or different values 
depending upon the nature of atoms and the associated wavefunction φA
and φB
.
• In order to generate an effective molecular orbital, the combination 
of atomic orbitals are determined by the following factors:
 (a) The atomic orbitals should have energies of comparable magnitude: 
Let there are two atomic orbitals i.e. φA
 and φB should have similar 
energy to form molecular orbital. If φA
 and φA
 are of different energy, 
then electron try to get associated with that atomic orbital which has 
lower energy.
 Like: H2
 molecule, written as HA—HB
.
 The combination of 1s(HA
) or 1s(HB
) or 2s (HA
) and 2s (HB
) or 2px
(HA
) 
and 2px
(HB
), and so on will be the most effective i.e. the coefficients CA
and CB
 are expected to have comparable values (in fact, both of them 
will have the same values because atoms A and B are identical and 
the orbital in combination have identical energies). The combination 
1s(HA
) and 2s(HB
) or 1s(HA
) and 3s(HB
) etc. may not be effective as 
the energies of involved atomic orbitals have a large difference.
 (b) Only those atomic orbitals combine which have same symmetry 
relative to the molecular axis.
 Like: Formation of C—H bond, involves the overlap of 2px
 of C and 
1s of H. Both these atomic orbitals are symmetrical about internuclear 
axis. Hence, the wavefunction formed is9.4 Approximation of linear combination of atomic orbitals: LCAO–MO Treatment 483
ψMO = C1
2px(C) + C2
1s
(H)
(c) The combination is better if the charge clouds of φA
 and φB
 overlap 
each other as much as possible.
• Physical	significance	of	coefficients	in	LCAO–MO	treatment:	
Since the electron distribution is given by the square of the wavefunction, 
the electron distribution for the function is given by:

The terms C1

 describe the probability of finding the electron in the 
atomic orbitals φA and φB
 respectively, and the coefficient 2C1C2
 describes 
the electron probability density of orbitals φA and φB overlapping in the 
bond region.

and, C1

 and C2

9.5 LCAO–MO TREATMENT OF HYDROGEN MOLECULE 
ION (H2
+
)
The hydrogen molecule ion (H+
2
) which contains two protons and one electron 
is the simplest molecule to be treated by LCAO–MO method. Even though 
Schrodinger equation for H+
2
 ion is solved exactly but we examine this system 
under LCAO and Born-Oppenheimer approximation. 
The H+
2 was discovered by Thomson in a Cathode ray tube. From 
spectroscopic studies, r = 1.6 eV and dissociation energy = 2.8 eV.
The lowest energy atomic orbital of the hydrogen atom is the 1s orbital. 
It is expected that the linear combination of 1s orbitals will yield molecular 
orbital of the lowest energy. Referring to the two hydrogen atoms of H+
2 ion as 
A and B, we may write the trial wavefunction in the LCAO–MO framework as:
ψ = C1

For the hydrogen molecule ion, (H2

the atomic orbitals which we have mixed are of identical nature. It follows that
HAA = HBB
Thus, the above equation becomes:
 (HAA – E)

HAA – E = ±(HAB – ES)
Hence, the two roots are:

Bonding and Antibonding Orbitals: A molecular orbital whose energy 
is lesser than those of the isolated atomic orbitals is called bonding molecular 
orbital (BMO). Placing the electron in this orbital decreases the energy of the 
system, and hence contributes towards the formation of a chemical bond.
Conversely, if the energy of molecular orbital is larger than those of isolated 
atomic orbitals, it is known as antibonding molecular orbital (ABMO). Placing 
the electron in this orbital contributes towards making the molecule less stable.

From graph (Fig. 9.6), we conclude that:
 1. In case of graph of ‘ψ+
’ [Fig. 9.6 (a)], the electron density is pilled up 
between the regions of two nuclei and it corresponds to the bonded state.
 Whereas, in the graph of ‘ψ–
’ [Fig. 9.6 (b)] it has node between the two 
nuclei, so electron density is becoming zero between nuclei A and B and 
it corresponds to unbounded state.
 2. ‘ψ+
’ exhibits the formation of stable chemical bond and therefore it is called 
as bonding molecular orbital (BMO).490 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding
 Whereas, ψ–
, describe state everywhere repulsive, therefore called as 
antibonding molecular orbital (ABMO) and less bond formation.
 3. For ground state, ψ for H2
+
 is ‘ψ+
’ (or ψg
) and ground state wavefunction 
is symmetrical about intermolecular axis and hence denoted by σ (sigma), 
Since, it is gerade, therefore, written as σ
g
. Since, it is made of 1s orbital, 
therefore, the molecular orbital is written as σ
g
1s. This molecular orbital 
has energy lower than energy of two H atoms (H+
 and H–
).
 In case ‘ψ’
–
 (or ψu
), the molecular orbital is represented as σu
1s. This 
molecular orbital has energy greater than the energy of two H atoms
(H+
 and H–
)
\ E
g
 < Eu
.
 4. In the region between the two nuclei, both ψ1s(A)
 and ψ1s(B)
 have appreciable 
values, and so does their product. 
 In ‘ψ+
2
’ [eq. (9.12)], the term 2(1s
A
 · 1s
B
), which appears in the numerator 
has a positive sign indicating that the probability of finding the electron 
between the two nuclei is relatively high. The electrons in this region 
interact with both the nuclei and hence the electrostatic attraction has a 
large negative value. This attraction is larger than the nuclear repulsion. 
Thus, there is a release of energy (or lowering of P.E.) when an electron is 
placed in the bonding orbital. [Fig. 9.6 (c)]
 5. The antibonding orbital ‘ψ’
–
 [Fig. 9.6 (b)] has a zero value wherever ψ1s(A)
and ψ1s(B)
 have the same value. This occurs at r = R/2. Thus, the molecular 
orbital, ψ–
 has a zero value in a plane which is perpendicular to and bisects 
the axis between the two nuclei. This plane is known as nodal plane.
 The value of ‘ψ–
2
’ [Fig. 9.6 (d)] is also zero on the nodal plane. Thus, the 
probability of finding an electron on the nodal plane is zero and it is low in 
the region between the nuclei. In other words, the electron tends to avoid 
the region where it can interact with both nuclei. Hence, the electrostatic 
repulsion between the two nuclei is more than the net electrostatic attraction 
and thus there occurs an increase in P.E. when an electron is placed in the 
antibonding orbital.

Fig. 9.7. Variation of energy of molecular orbital with internuclear distance.
The potential energy curve depicts the variation of energy of a molecular 
orbital with the internuclear distance. For the orbitals, ψ+
 and ψ–
, the plots of 
E+
 Vs R and E–
 Vs R are shown in Fig. 9.7.
The potential energy of ‘ψ+
’ molecular orbital contains a minimum which 
corresponds to a stable H+
2
 molecule. The minimum occurs at 132 pm (known 
as bond distance) with the depth equal to 1.77 eV i.e., 170.8 kJ/mol (known as 
bond energy). The observed values are 106 pm and 2.79 eV i.e., 269.2 kJ/mole. 
Thus the calculated bond energy (maximum depth in the E+
 curve) is about 
60% of the correct vale. So, the agreement between the calculated and observed 
values is not very satisfactory.
The calculated values can be improved further by introducing additional 
parameters into the trial wavefunction such as including additional atomic 
orbitals and treating Z, the nuclear charge to be effective nuclear charge.

Since it represents an attractive term, it has negative value.

Physical significance of various integrals:
 1. Coloumb Integral: HAA (or aA

) are known as Coloumb 
Integrals. Their values are close to E1s(A)
 and E1s(B)
 respectively, where 
E1s(A)
 and E1s(B)
 represent respectively the energy of an electron in ψ1s(A)
and ψ1s(B)
 in the isolated atom.
 2. Resonance Integral: HAB (or βAB) is known as Resonance Integral, 
whose value is a measure of the exchange of an electron form one atom 
to another. It always have negative value.
 3. Overlap Integral: The integral SAB (or S) is known as Overlap Integral. 
It is the measure of extent of overlapping of the two atomic orbitals.
 4. Exchange Integral: The integral SAA or SBB represents some sort of 
exchange of electron between protons A and B and has a negative value.
9.6 HYDROGEN MOLECULE: QUALITATIVE TREATMENT
• Suppose there are two hydrogen atoms far apart and no interaction 
between them. Even though the atoms are identical, we use 1 and 2 for 
representation of atoms A and B i.e. HA
(e1
) and HB
(e2
).
 The wavefunction for these two atoms is ψA
(1) and ψB
(2).
 The total wavefunction for two separate hydrogen atoms is given as
ψ = ψA
(1) · ψB
(2).494 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding
Using this ψ, the E of system as a function of internuclear distance is 
determined, shown in Fig. 9.8.

Fig. 9.8. Variation of P.E. with internuclear distance.
From graph shown in Fig. 9.8, it is seen that:
 1. Energy of two isolated atoms is equal to zero, since no interaction between 
them, as they are far apart and hence denoted by a straight line.
 2. The curve N corresponds to wavefunction ψA
(1) · ψB
(2).
 3. The dip in P.E. curve indicates the bond formation.
Now, the bond energy corresponding to wavefunction [ψ = ψA
(1) · ψB
(2)],
is of the order of 6 Kcals/mole. Whereas the experimental value is 109 
Kcals/mole. Thus, the wavefunction is to be furthur modified. Also during 
writting ψ, we assume that electrons are distinguishable, therefore, e
–
(1) 
is associated with nucleus A and e
–
(2) is associated with nucleus B.
\ ψ = ψA
(1) · ψB
(2).
• But, when two atoms come close and overlap on atomic orbitals of each 
other, then we cannot distinguish between e
–
(1) and e
–
(2). Then, the 
system of two H atoms can be represented in two ways i.e. Ist and IInd
structure:
Therefore, Ist and IInd structure and thus wavefunction possible for H2
molecule are:
ψI
 = ψA
(1) · ψB
(2) or He He A B ( ) ( ) 1 2 ⋅
(I)
and
 ψII = ψA
(2) · ψB
(1) or H e H e A B ( ) ( ) 2 1 ⋅
(II)
Thus, the true wavefunction, ψ, is a combination of these two function.
ψ = C1ψI
 + C2ψII
 ψ = C1
[ψA
(1) · ψB
(2)] + C2
[ψA
(2) · ψB
(1)]
Because of symmetry, the two components of wavefunction have same 
weightage i.e. C1
 = C2
.9.6 Hydrogen Molecule: Qualitative Treatment 495
Since, weightage ∝ (Coefficient)2
 C1
2
 = C2
2
 C1
 = ±C2
\ the two wavefunction possible will be given as:
ψs
 = ψA
(1) · ψB
(2) + ψA
(2) · ψB
(1)
ψa
 = ψA
(1) · ψB
(2) – ψA
(2) · ψB
(1)
where, C1
 = C2
 = 1 (unity because of symmetry)
ψs
 = representing the symmetric combination, since it remains unchanged 
by interchanging e
–
, 1 and 2.
ψa
 = representing the antisymmetric combination, since it changes sign 
by interchanging e
–
, 1 and 2.
Again the energy of system as a function of internuclear distance is 
calculated by taking ψs
 and ψa
 separately, shown in Fig. 9.9:

r0 = distance when
P.E. is minimum
in the system.
Fig. 9.9. Variation of P.E. with internuclear distance 
From graph shown in Fig. 9.9, it is seen that:
1. ψa
= represents repulsive or non-bonding state.
 ψs
= represents attractive or bonding state.
 2. The symmetric combination of two wavefunction of system of two H 
atoms always leads to attraction between two atoms leading to formation 
of stable H2 molecule.
 3. The antisymmetric combination of two wavefunction of system of two H 
atoms always leads to repulsion between two atoms. So stable H2
 molecule 
not formed.
 Now the equilibrium distance where energy is minimum is 0.8 Å compare 
to experimental value of 0.74 Å. Also, the bond energy corresponding 
the above wavefunction is of the order of 72 Kcal/mole. Whereas, the 
experimental value is 109 Kcal/mole. This is due to electron exchange 
between the two atoms. The additional energy = (72 – 6) = 66 Kcal/mole 496 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding
is called as exchange energy. Thus, ψs
 is wavefunction for ground state of 
H2
. It is covalent wavefunction.
• Now furthur improvement of wavefunction can be done by considering:
 1. The screening of nucleus A from nucleus B, due to probability of electron 
pair present between two nuclei.
 2. The atomic orbitals are no longer spherically symmetrical when orbitals 
overlap with each other.
 3. Both the electrons are present on the same nuclei i.e., ionic configuration 
is taken into account, which further gives two more ways to represent 
the system of 2H atoms i.e., IIIrd and IVth structures.
Therefore, IIIrd and IVth structures and thus wavefunction possible for 
H2
 molecule are:

If both the electrons are taken on the same atom, then ψ is improved and 
bond energy is increased to 95 Kcal/mole.
• Also by taking interelectronic distance into account the bond energy 
comes 0.5 Kcal/mole just less than the experimental value.
• Thus, by modifying the ψ, the bond energy approached to the experimental 
bond energy value.

 Here, λ = measure of degree of ionic character of the bond. i.e., how 
much these ionic structures contribute to main structucres of H2
 molecule. 
The best value of λ = 0.17.
• Physical interpretation of ψ is that molecule is represented adequately by 
covalent or ionic structure. Thus, it is between two extremes and there is 
resonance between various possible structures. As a result of resonance, 
the total energy of system decreases and there is extra stability in molecule 9.6 Hydrogen Molecule: Qualitative Treatment 497
in terms of resonance energy. This resonance energy is the difference in 
energy between the actual molecule and energy of resonating structures. 
This resonance is an important integral part of valence bond theory.

9.6.1 Pauli’s Exclusion Principle w.r.t. Hydrogen Molecule
According to Pauli’s, the total wavefunction is a product of orbital wavefunction 
and spin wavefunction
ψtotal = ψorbital · ψspin (or) ψspatial · ψspin 
So far we have discussed the orbital part of wavefunction. The spin part 
is not as important as orbital part. But it is important in hydrogen molecule.
There are 2 possibilities of spin; ms
 = ± 1/2
 (a) spin wavefunction is represented as ‘a’ when ms
 = +1/2
 (b) spin wavefunction is represented as ‘β’ when ms
 = –1/2
When there is system of two electrons, there are various combinations of 
spin wavefunction, given as:
 (i) a(1) · a(2) → Symmetric
 (ii) β(1) · β(2) → Symmetric
 (iii) 1
2
[ ( α β 1 2 )() ()( + α β 2 1)] → Symmetric These are of two
electrons having
opposite spin
 
 (iv) 1
2
[ ( α β 1 2 )() ()( − α β 2 1)] → Antisymmetric 
According to Pauli’s, the total waveufunction is combination of orbital 
wavefunction and spin wavefunction. But certain combinations are not 
permissible, so which combinations are permissible or not permissible is 
given by Pauli’s exclusion principle. In any atomic or molecular system, the 
total wavefunction (ψ) must be antisymmetric. To make total wavefunction 498 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding
antisymmetric, if orbital wavefunction is symmetric, then spin wavefunction 
is antisymmetric and vice versa.
Now, there are two orbital wavefunction i.e.,
 (i) ψs
 = ψA
(1) · ψB
(2) + ψA
(2) · ψB
(1) → Symmetric
 (ii) ψa
 = ψA
(1) · ψB
(2) – ψA
(2) · ψB
(1) → Antisymmetric
So, possible combination which exists if we want ψtotal to be antisymmetric 
are:

Now, ψs
is the ground state and is associated with one spin wavefunction.
Whereas, ψa
is the excited state and associated with three spin wavefunctions.
Since the multiplicity of a state is in general equal to the number of spin 
wavefunction associated with a state.
\ Ground state of molecule is singlet and excited state of molecule 
is triplet.
Thus, from combination of these wavefunctions, we can say that in 
ground state the molecule formation can takes place only when two electrons 
are antiparallel or have opposite spin. So we come to more familiar form of 
Pauli’s exclusion principle, which states that no two electrons in a given 
atom have all the same four quantum numbers. Thus, even if the other 
three quantum numbers are same, the fourth quantum number is different 
i.e.,spin quantum number.9.6 Hydrogen Molecule: Qualitative Treatment 499

Taking the case of hydrogen molecule, the ground state atomic orbital is 
1s and wavefunction of hydrogen molecule is obtained by putting 1s instead 
of ψA
or ψB
.
Thus, the above combination of total wavefunction for hydrogen molecule 
can be written as:
 1. ψtotal = 
1
2
1 1 12 12 1 1 1

[ (s s ) ( ⋅ +) (s s ) ( ⋅ ⋅ )] [ ( α β 1 2 )() ()( − α β 2 1)]

 3. ψtotal =

1 1 12 12 1 1 1

[ (s s ) ( ⋅ − ) (s s ) ( ⋅ ⋅ ) ] [ ( α β 1 2 )() ()( + α β 2 1)]
Thus, for hydrogen molecule only (1) combination of wavefunction exists 
i.e. ground state having two electrons with different spin. Thus, we can say 
that in ground state, the hydrogen molecule formation takes place from two 
hydrogen atoms only when two electrons have opposite spin. Thus, we cannot 
have more than two electrons in an orbital.
9.6.2 Hund’s Rule of Maximum Multiplicity w.r.t. Hydrogen 
Molecule
According to Hund’s rule, configuration with the maximum spin multiplicity 
will have the minimum energy and therefore, is most stable.
Let us consider the case of 2p orbitals. The three 2p orbitals are degenerate 
orbitals and can be filled in different ways. The different possibilities of spin 
for two electrons present in 2p orbital are:
 1. Both electrons present in same orbital but with opposite spin

 Thus, whenever there are two electrons (as in case of hydrogen molecule), 
then the two electrons should occupy different orbitals with identical spin 
[i.e., possibility no. (2)] because then spin multiplicity is maximum and 
greater stability is associated with the system.

earlier section (9.5) written the framework of the LCAO-MO approximation.
The total energy E(R) of a diatomic system for a fixed nuclear framework

Fig. 9.11. Energy as function of internuclear distance.
From Fig. (9.11), it is seen that the minimum value of E0
(R) is found for 
R = 0.84 Å. The observed (exp.) equilibrium bond length in H2
 is 0.74 Å. The 
calculated bond energy is 2.68 eV while the observed (exp.) value is 4.75 eV.
Thus, the simple molecular orbital theory accounts for only 56% of the 
observed bond energy. This shows that the simple MO picture does not describe 
the molecular dissociation completely. i.e., there is some discrepancy in the 
calculated and observed (exp.) value. The reason for this failure can be found 
from the form of the molecular wavefunction, which may be written in the 
following form eq. (9.19).

There are 4 terms in the expanded form. The Ist and IInd terms correspond to 
a situation in which both electrons are associated with the same atom i.e. these 
terms are representing the ionic structures of H2
 molecule.

On the other hand, the IIIrd and IVth terms represent the covalent structures. 
Now, the wavefunction according to MO, is giving 50% weightage to ionic 
structure and 50% weightage to covalent structure. This does not seem to 
be correct because the ionisation potential of a hydrogen atom is high while 
the electron affinity is low, the reaction, 2H → H+
 + H–
, found to be highly 
endothermic and, therefore, the occurrence of the ionic structures is likely to 
be very rare
So, we can write
ψcovalent = 1s

\ It is easily seen that the MO approach gives equal weightage to the ionic 
and covalent structures. This is highly unreasonable for the H2
 molecule and thus, 
resonable for the poor agreement between the calculated and observed results.
Therefore, MO is responsible for poor agreement between experimental 
and theoretical value.
Try to improve ψ by introducing parameters C1
 and C2
, which can be found 
by using variation method.
 ψ = C1ψcovalent + C2 ψionic
It was found that ‘R’ at equilibrium is 74.9 pm
and experimentally, ‘R’ at equilibrium is 74.1 pm
Also, Dissociation energy = 386 kJ/mole.
and experimentally, Dissociation energy = 458 kJ/mole.506 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding
\ By including values of C1
 and C2
, value of ψ is improved.
Also, ψ is further improved by taking more atomic orbitals. This blending 
of new orbitals is called configuration	interaction.
9.7.1 Configuration	Interaction
Configuration interaction is the extension of simple MOT to include excited 
state configuration.
Configuration interaction means taking a linear combination of the functions 
corresponding to different electronic configurations having the same symmetry. 
For example in H2
 molecule, the ground state configuration is
H2
(Ground state)
 = σ
21s σ*1s = σ σ g g ( )1 2( )
 i.e.
H
1*s

and the doubly excited state is
H2
(Ground state)
 = σ1s σ*1s
2
 = σ σ u u ( )1 2( )
 i.e.
H
1*s
1s
H
Both have singlet states with same overall symmetry. Therefore, a better 
wavefunction is the linear combinations of the two singlet state functions.
ψMO = | ( σ σ) ( ) | µ σ| ( ) ( σ ) | g g 1 2 + u u 1 2
where m is the mixing	parameter. It can be shown that ψMO = ψVB if

Applying configuration gives, better and improved wavefunction (ψ) and 
also gives eigen values which are in good agreement with experimental results.9.7 LCAO–MO Treatment of Hydrogen Molecule 507
9.8	 Valence	Bond	Treatment	(VBT)	of	Hydrogen	Molecule
Suppose there are two hydrogen atoms A and B with their electron such that they 
are present far apart.Let 1s
A
 and 1s
B
 be the 1s orbitals of the two hydrogen atoms 
in their ground state. Then wavefunction of the composite system is given as:
φ1
 = 1s
A
(1) · 1s
B
(2)
Since these electrons are indistinguishable, the wavefunction becomes:
φ2
 = 1s
A
(2) · 1s
B
(1)
Thus, total wavefunction (ψ) is given as
ψ = C1
φ1
 + C2
φ2
Also because of symmetry:
 C1
2
 = C2

 or C 1
 = ±C2
The energy of the system is given by variation theorem as:
 E =

〈ψ ⋅ ψ〉

Using the expression of wavefunction (ψ) in the expression of energy (E), 
we get a set of secular equations. [Refer section 9.5]

9.9	 COMPARISON	OF	VBT	AND	MOT
There are two different approaches to quantum theory of molecule:
 1. In VBT, we start with individual atom and consider interaction between the 
two. Suppose there are 2 atoms with one electron each, the wavefunction 
in VBT is written as:
ψ1
 = ψA (1) · ψB
(2)
ψ2
 = ψ (2) · ψB
(1)
ψtotal = C1
[ψ1
+ ψ2
]
ψtotal = C1
[ψA (1) · ψB
(2) + ψA (2) · ψB
(1)]
In MOT, wavefunction is written as
ψ1
 = CAψA
(1) + CBψB
(1)
ψ2
 = CAψA
(2) + CBψB
(2)
ψtotal = ψ1
 · ψ2
 = [CAψA
(1) + CBψB
(1)][CAψA
(2) + CBψB
(2)]
ψtotal = C2
AψA

(2) + C2
BψB
(1) · ψB
(2)
+ CACB
[ψB
(1) · ψA
(2) + ψA
(1) · ψB
(2)]
 2. The wavefunction in VBT is covalent function.
 Whereas in MOT, there are two structures which are ionic and two structures 
which are covalent.516 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding
 \ Wavefunction given in VBT is different from MOT i.e., there is lack 
of ionic terms. Thus, the MOT overestimate the ionic terms and VBT 
underestimate the ionic terms by neglecting altogether. Thus, to improve, 
ionic terms have been added to valence bond function.
 3. Shortcoming	of	MOT: True wavefunction must take in account the charge 
correlation of electrons (the avoidance of electron by other on electrostatic 
ground is called charge correlation). Now, ψcov.
 describes a very strong 
correlation because one electron is present near nucleus A and other electron 
near nucleus B. Whereas in ionic terms (ψionic) it disregards the charge 
correlation completely.
 \ MOT wavefunction underestimate charge correlation whereas VBT 
wavefunction overestimates charge correlation.
 4. It can be shown that:
 VBT + Ionic terms = MOT + Configuration Interaction (C.I.)
where C.I. = The extension of simple MOT to include excited state 
configuration is called configuration interaction.

• Simplest molecular orbital which we can form is by utilising 1s atomic 
orbital
ψ±
 = 1s
A
 ± 1s
B
In ‘ψ’
+
, the electron density is in the region between two nuclei. Whereas, 
ψ– 
excludes the electron density from the region between two nuclei.
Thus ψ+ = Bonding molecular orbital (BMO)
 ψ– 
= Antibonding molecular orbital (ABMO)
• Ways	of	representing	molecular	orbitals/Designation	of	molecular	
orbital:	
 1. When the electron density is symmetrical about internuclear axis, we 
designate the molecular orbitals as ‘σ’. If the molecular orbital is made 
of 1s atomic orbital, we designate it as σ1s.
Thus, Bonding molecular orbital (ψ+
) = σ1s
Antibonding molecular orbital (ψ–
) = σ*1s
 2. The other way for designating molecular orbital is based on symmetry 
of molecular orbital under an inversion of wavefunction through a 
midway between two nuclei. If wavefunction does not change sign under 
inversion, then called gerade	(in German, even = g) and if wavefunction 
changes sign on inversion called ungerade (odd = u).

) = σ

No overlap between s and p because s-orbital is (+ve) everywhere. So 
overlap between (+ve) lobe of p-orbital with s-orbital is cancelled by 
overlap of (–ve) lobe of p-orbital with s-orbital. Therefore, no overlap 
and no bonding.
• p-orbital have higher energy than s-orbital. But molecular orbital which 
are formed with two 2pz
 orbitals is different from molecular orbital 
formed by overlap of two 2px

(Molecular Orbital Energy Level Diagram given Initially)
The relative order of energies of various molecular orbitals is required 
for writing down the electronic configuration of homonuclear diatomic 
molecules. The energy of a molecular orbital depends on the following 
two factors:
 1. The type of atomic orbitals from which the molecular orbital is built up.
 2. The extent of overlap between the two involved orbitals.

 molecular is unstable and does not exist as bond order is zero.
	 Note:	Strengthening of the bond occurs due to the addition of electron in 
bonding molecular orbital or removal of the electron from antibonding 
molecular orbital.
 However, weakening of the bond occurs if an electron is added to 
the antibonding molecular orbital or it is removed from the bonding 
molecular orbital.
• Relative	order	of	energies	of	molecular	orbitals	with	s–p	interaction:	
(Anamolous behaviour of B2
,C2
 and N2
)
On the basis of above general molecular orbital diagram, the configuration 
of B2
 and C2
 is not explained. There is no interaction between 1s and 2s
because of large energy difference. But the difference of energy between 
2s and 2p is not very much but varies with nuclear charge (Z).
	 Like:	In F2
, Z increases, difference in energy between 2s and 2p is large.
This energy difference between 2s and 2p varies from 200 kJ/mole in Li 
to 2500 kJ/mole in F2
.
The elements on LHS of periodic table, the 2s and 2p interact or mix 
with one another (i.e., B2
, C2
 and N2
) but again as we go more and more 
in RHS, the 2s and 2p interaction is not there (i.e., F2
 and O2
). This 
phenomena is equivalent to hybridisation in VBT.522 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding
The molecular orbitals of similar symmetry interact with one another. 
In case of B2
, C2
 and N2
, the σ2s interact with σ2px
 because of similar 
symmetry. Due to this interaction, σ2s is further stablished whereas σ2px
becomes less stable or goes higher in energy and due to this there is 
reversal in position of σ2px
 and π2py
 = π2pz
.
 Similarly, σ*2s interact with σ*2px
 because of similar symmetry. Due 
to this interaction, σ*2s in further stabilised. Whereas σ*2px
 becomes 
less stable or goes higher in energy.

9.11 LCAO–MO TREATMENT OF HETERONUCLEAR 
DIATOMIC	MOLECULES
Principles involved in the formation of molecular orbitals for heteronuclear 
diatomic molecules is similar to that of homonuclear diatomic molecules. But 
in this the two atoms are different. The molecular orbital diagram depends on 
the difference in electronegativity between two atoms. (Also in this, LCAO 
approximation is done like in homonuclear diatomic molecules). In homonuclear 
diatomic molecules, the molecular orbitals are written as:
ψb
(Bonding MO)
 = φA
 + φB
and ψa
(Antibonding MO)
 = φA
 – φB
Here, C1
 = C2
 and C1
 = –C2524 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding
 But in heteronuclear diatomic molecule, the MO’s are written as:
 ψ = CA
φA
 + CB
φB
 (Here, CA
≠ CB
)
The atomic orbitals of both atoms (A and B) contribute equally to molecular 
orbital, therefore, CA
 = CB
 in case of homonuclear diatomic molecules. Also in 
case of homonuclear diatomic molecule similar atomic orbitals overlap.
But, in case of heteronuclear diatomic molecules, this is not necessary, that 
overlap is between similar atomic orbitals. In heteronuclear molecular, CA
≠ CB
because there is difference in electronegativity between two atoms.
For the bonding molecular orbital, the coefficient of more electronegative 
atom has a larger value. For the antibonding orbital, the coefficient of lesser 
electronegative atom has a larger value.
Suppose,
ψb
(Bonding MO)
 = CA
φA
 + CB
φB
 (CB
 > CA
) 
 provided B is more
 electronegative than A.
and
ψa
(Antibonding MO)
 = CA
φA
 – CB
φB 
(CA
 > CB
) 
 provided A is less
 electronegative than B.
The	 heteronuclear	 diatomic	 molecules	 may	 be	 classified	 into	 two	
categories:
Category	1:	Both the atoms contain ‘s’ and ‘p’ valence orbitals.
Example: CO, NO, BN, BO etc.
Category	2:	One the atom is H and other contains both ‘s’ and ‘p’ valence 
orbitals.
Example: LiH, HF, HCl etc.
• Now we will discuss the energies of various molecular orbitals for the 
above two categories along with the electronic configurations of few 
molecules.
“CATEGORY	1”
Let the atom B in the molecule AB be more electronegative than atom A. 
The energy of atomic orbital of atom B will have a smaller value than that of 
the corresponding orbital of atom A. If the atomic number difference between 
atoms A and B is not very much, then the formation of σ and π, bonding and 
antibonding molecular orbital in AB molecule is similar to those of homonuclear 
diatomic molecules. Then sequence of energy levels is similar to homonuclear 
diatomic molecule (i.e., as that in B2
, C2
 and N2
).

We expect that the bond energy (B.E.) and bond length of N2
 and CO are 
identical.
 B.E. of CO = 1071 and B.E. of N2
 = 942
 Bond length of N2
 = 110 pm and Bond length of CO = 113 pm526 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding
Since, O is more electronegative than C, so the tendency is that the bonding 
electron is more closer to O than C, only then stable molecular orbital is formed. 
But in N2
, electron density is symmetrical between two N atoms and in CO, 
electron density is more towards O than C. Also the bonding molecular orbital 
resemble the atomic orbital of O than that of C and antibonding molecular orbital 
resemble the atomic orbital of C more than that of O. Therefore, O contribute 
more to bonding molecular orbital and C contribute more to antibonding 
molecular orbital.
Also,	 ‘g’	 and	 ‘u’	 has	 no	meaning	 since	 symmetry	 has	 destroyed	in	
heteronuclear	molecule.

• Since, there is one unpaired electron present in configuration, thus
 NO is paramagnetic in nature.
• Also stability of ‘NO’ molecule is much more than we expect from 
molecule with an unpaired electron. This is due to distribution of electrons 
between both the atomic orbitals than localised on one atomic orbital.
• Since O is more electronegative than N, therefore energy of O is lower 
than N.
• We state the same energy level diagram for NO as than in CO (shown 
in Fig. 9.15.)
“CATEGORY	2”
In this category, we have a molecule where H is more electronegative than 
the other atom (e.g.: LiH) or vice versa (e.g.: HF).
The H atom contains only one valence orbital which can mix with 2s and

The molecular orbital of HF molecule must involve ‘1s’ of H and it has 
to take up one of the ‘2p’ orbital of F. The spectroscopic evidence shows 
that the 1s and 2s orbitals of F are of lower energy than 1s of H and do 
not participate in bond formation.
If the internuclear axis lies along x-direction, then it is 2px
 of F which 
lies along with 1s of H. Also energy of 1s of H and 2px
 of F is close to 
each other and it may be assumed that an effective overlap takes place 
only between 1s of H and 2px
 of F orbitals.

• Since electrons are pulled towards the atom that has larger electronegativity, 
thus the electron will be now closer towards F, since it is more 
electronegative.
 Thus, it is expected that in the bonding MO, the coefficient of φ2 px

will be much larger than the φ1s(H). In the antibonding MO, the coefficient 
of φ1s(H) will be larger than the φ2 px

 Actual molecular orbital is written as what is the actual contribution of 
H and Li. We use self-consistent field (SCF) method to calculate the

9.12 LCAO–MO TREATMENT OF TRIATOMIC	MOLECULES
• In this section, we describe the MO treatments of BeH2
 and H2O molecule. 
BeH2
 is linear and H2O is non-linear. In general, we can take the linear 
combination of the valence orbital of all the three atoms. The coefficients, 
as usual, be determined by the variation method. The number of molecular 
orbitals (n) formed will be equal to the number of atomic orbital (n) that 
are being mixed to form the molecular orbitals.
• Localised molecular orbitals and Delocalised molecular orbtials:
There are two quantum-mechanical approaches to explain the chemical 
bonding i.e. molecular orbital (MO) approach and valence bond (VB) 
approach.
In the molecular orbital treatment, electron pairs were delocalised over 
the nuclei and not concentrated just between two nuclei.
According to valence bond (VB) approach, electrons in a molecule 
occupy atomic orbitals rather than molecular orbitals. The atomic orbitals 
overlap on bond formations and larger the overlap, the stronger is the 
bond. This localised picture of a chemical bond is, in a way, equivalent 
to the delocalised picture given by the molecular orbital (MO) approach 
because, if the charge distributions in each molecular orbital are worked 
out and then added up in the regions where the bonds are expected, it 
will be found that the total charge density will be nearly two, that is the 
charge on an electron pair.
Example: (a) Suppose	we	take	‘BeH2

that one electron may be excited from 2s to 2p orbital.

Now, after excitation of electron, ‘Be’ is capable of forming two covalent 
bonds. In order to explain the directional characteristic of the bond and 
also to explain the fact that 2(Be—H) bonds are equivalent, it is suggested 
that the hybrid orbitals are formed by combination of 2s of Be and 2px
of Be.
The energy supplied to Be is compensated for when 2(Be—H) bonds are 
formed, thus, BeH2 is stable. Since the BeH2 molecule is linear, each of 
the Be—H bond is considered to be formed as a result of overlapping 
between ‘sp’ hybrid orbitals of Be and 1s orbital of H. The other two ‘p’ 
orbitals of Be atoms, which lie perpendicular to the molecular axis, are 
not involved in the bonding and hence they constitute a doubly degenerate 
non-bonding orbitals of the molecule.
 The two ‘sp’ hybrid orbitals of Be atom are:

It must be remembered that ‘px
’ has one (+ve) and one (–ve) lobe, when 
it overlaps with 1s of H, the lobe on one side is added and the other side 
is neglected532 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding
Also hybrid orbitals are better than normal atomic orbitals because when 
we take hybrid orbitals, the lobes are more extended towards the x-axis, 
therefore, overlap will be better. Thus, bond formation will be better as 
compared to normal atomic orbitals. Also in normal atomic orbitals, the 
bonds are not equivalent.
The 1s of H will overlap with the with the ‘sp’ of Be i.e., sp1
 on one side 
and sp2
 on other side.

• Molecular Orbital Approach of BeH2
 (Delocalised	MO’s):
In BeH2
, the valence orbitals which are used in the construction of 
molecular orbhitals are 1s(Ha
), 1s(Hb
), 2s(Be) and 2px
(Be).
 1. From the 1s(Ha
) and 1s(Hb
) orbitals, the following group orbitals may 
be formed
ψ+
 = ψ ψ 1 1 s s a b ( ) H H + ( ) : Symmetrical
ψ–
 = ψ ψ 1 1 s s a b ( ) H H − ( ) : Antisymmetrical
 These two group orbitals are of ‘σ’ type.
 2. Since the group orbital ‘ψ’
+
 is symmetrical, it may be combined linearly 
with the symmetrical 2s orbital of Be.
 Since the group orbital ‘ψ’
–
 is antisymmetrical, it will combine with 
the antisymmetrical 2px
 orbital of Be.9.12 LCAO–MO Treatment of Triatomic Molecules 533
 Hence, the four molecular orbitals formed from these mixing are as 
follows:
 σs
 = ψ1 = C C 1 B ψ ψ 2 1 s s e 2 H H ψ1s a b ( ) ( ) ( ) + + ( ) = Bonding
 σ*s

 σx

( ) ( ) ( ) − − ( ) = Bonding
 3. The atomic orbitals 2py
(Be) and 2pz
(Be) have zero overlap with 1s(Ha
) 
and 1s(Hb
). Thus, no mixing between these orbitals takes place. Thus, 
2py
(Be) and 2pz
(Be) orbitals will be non-bonding in nature.

Since ‘O’ has two unpaired electron and hence two covalent bonds can 
be formed. The molecule of H2O is non-linear with HOH experimental bond 
angle equal to 105°.
• Valence Bond Approach of H2O (Localised MO’s):
The formation of localised molecular orbitals in H2O is explained from 
the following two view points:
 1. The two O—H bonds are formed as a result of overlapping between 2p
oxygen orbitals and 1s hydrogen orbitals.
 Thus the wavefunction can be written as:
ψ′1
 = C C ′ + ′ 1 2 (H 2 0 1 px s a
( ) ψ )

+

+

–
Ha
90°

 The expected bond angle of 90° between the two O—H bonds is 
expanded a little due to the repulsion of two protons. This model of H2O 
neglects the two lone pair of electron in 2s and one of the 2p orbitals 
of oxygen.
 2. Since H2O molecule contains eight valence electrons, the most stable 
structure would be the one where these electrons stay as far apart from 
each other as possible.
 This is achieved by visualizing the valence orbitals of oxygen in the ‘sp3
’ 
hybrid state where the four equivalent orbitals point towards the corner 
of a regular tetrahedron.

 The two O—H bonds in H2O are thus formed by overlapping between 
the two sp3
 hybrid orbitals of oxygen and 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms. 
If the structure is tetrahedral, the bond angle should be 109°28′ but the 
experimental bond angle in H2O is 105°, owing to the expansion of the 
electronic cloud by the two protons. The expansion of electronic cloud 
means the O—H bonds acquire a little more of 2p character. Also this 
difference between 109° and 105° is explained by adding some more 
terms in the wavefunction.536 Chapter 9 Chemical Bonding

Also the two sp3

are further available for bond formation. The H atom on other H2O molecule

unusual property to molecule.9.12 LCAO–MO Treatment of Triatomic Molecules 537
• Molecular Orbital Approach of H2O (Delocalised MO’s): The molecule 
of H2O is non-linear with HOH bond angle equal to 105°.
The proper combinations of bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals 
of two H atoms are:
ψ+
 = ψ ψ 1 1 s s a b ( ) H H + ( )
ψ–
 = ψ ψ 1 1 s s a b ( ) H H − ( ) (Group orbitals)
The valence orbitals of oxygen are 2s, 2px
, 2py
 and 2pz
. Their combinations 
with ψ+
 and ψ–
 are as follows:
 1. During the overlapping of 1s(H) orbitals with 2pz
(0) orbital, the proper 
combination of two hydrogen atoms that can combine with 2pz
 orbital 
of oxygen is [1s(Ha
) + 1s(Hb
)] i.e., ψ+
 group orbital. Besides this, ψ+
group orbital will also have positive overlap with 2s orbital of oxygen.
 Thus, we may consider the formation of three nonlocalized MO’s by 
mixing three atomic orbitals ψ2s(0), ψ2 0 pz

 In order to have more effective overlapping we form first two hybrid

 The orbital [ ] ψ ψ 2 0 p p x y () () − 2 0 will act as a non-bonding MO.

rrr10.1 INTRODUCTION
Hückel molecular theory was developed by Eric Hückel in 1930. It was later 
developed by Coulson and Longuet-Higgins and several others into a more 
useful theory capable of providing significant interpretations to the chemistry 
of conjugated systems.
The unsaturated carbon compounds which consist of alternate double 
and single bonds are conventionally called the conjugated molecules. These 
molecules are generally planar, and valence orbitals of the carbon hybridise 
in the ‘sp2
’ manner pointing the three hybrid orbitals in the direction of three 
neigbouring atoms in the plane while the unhybridised 2pz
 orbital lies with its 
axis perpendicular to the molecular plane. The electrons in the sp2
-orbitals are 
called sigma (σ) electrons, they are contained in the molecular plane and do not 
possess any angular momentum. The orbitals formed from the unhybridised 2pz
orbitals are called pi(σ) orbitals and the electron in these orbitals lie above and 
below the molecular plane. These pi(π) electrons possess one unit of angular 
momentum about the C—C bond. Since sigma and pi-electron are contained in 
planes perpendicular to each other, the interaction between these two types of 
electrons is likely to be negligible in the planar conjugated molecules. Therefore, 
the molecular orbitals for π-electrons in a conjugated system may be treated 
independent of sigma electrons. These orbitals are set up according to the linear 
combination of 2pz
 atomic orbitals of each carbon atom in a conjugated molecule.
Hückel molecular orbital theory is also an approximate method (based 
on the variation method) to solve the electronic Schrodinger equation of 
organic conjugated systems. In conjugated systems, the electronic properties 
are determined by pi(π) electrons. However, Hückel did not neglect sigma 
(σ) electrons at all but according to him the pi(π) electrons are moving in an 
electrostatic potential generated by nuclei and sigma (σ) electrons, therefore 
Hückel Molecular Orbital Theory
10552 Chapter 10 Hückel Molecular Orbital Theory
the systems electronic properties are determined by the π electrons. This also 
simplifies the problem of many electron systems as:
Examples:
1. Ethylene (H2C CH2
)
 total number of electrons = 16
 total number of π electrons = 2
 therefore, 16 electrons problem can be reduced to 2 electrons under HMO 
theory.
 2. Benzene (C6H6
)
 total number of electrons = 42
 total number of π electrons = 6
 therefore, 42 electrons problem can be reduced to 6 electrons under HMO 
theory.
Hückel also made few assumptions about three kinds of integrals to simplify 
the secular equation (coulomb integral, exchange integral, resonance integral 
and overlap integral):
 (a) All overlap integrals are zero i.e., Sij = 0.
 (b) All the orbitals are normalised i.e., Sii = 1.
 (c) Coulomb integral Hii, which refers to the energy of the electron in the 
2pz
 orbital on the i
th carbon atom is denoted by a.
 (d) Hij = β only if atom i and j are bonded directly else all other Hij = 0.

Q 6π-electrons in benzene molecule will occupy all bonding molecular 
orbitals.
 Eπ
 = 2(a + 2β) + 2(a + β) + 2(a + β)
 = 2a + 4β + 4a + 4β = 6a + 8β
10.3 DELOCALIZATION ENERGY
Delocalization energy is the stabilizing energy in conjugated systems, it is due 
to the delocalization of the π electrons on the system due to which stabilization 
is achieved.
In Hückel molecular orbital theory, delocalization energy is the stabilizing 
energy of the system with respect to ethylene molecules.
As in few cases:
 1. 1,3-Butadiene 
 H C2 CH—CH CH2
1 2 3 4
 Eπ
 (butadiene) = 4a + 4.472β (Refer Section 10.2.2) 
 However butadiene is formed by the two ethylene molecules i.e. the Eπ
 of 
two ethylene molecules should be equal to the Eπ 
for butadiene
 Eπ 
(ethylene) = 2a + 2β (Refer Section 10.2.1)
2Eπ 
(ethylene) = 4a + 4β
 However, the formation of 1,3-butdiene leads to delocalization of π-electrons 
leading to stabilization of butadiene. Hence, the Eπ 
(butadiene) is not same 
as that of two molecules of ethylene. Therefore, the difference between 
the Eπ
 of butadiene and Eπ
 of two ethylene molecules will correspond to 
the stabilizing delocalization energy.
 Hence, 
 Delocalization energy = Eπ 
(Butadiene) – 2Eπ
 (Ethylene)
 = (4a + 4.472β) – (4a + 4β)
 = 0.472β = 0.472 × (–75 kJ/mole)
(Q β ∼ –75kJ/mole)
 = 35.4 kJ/mole ~ 36 kJ/mole10.3 Delocalization Energy 561
 Hence, Butadiene gets stabilized by the factor of 0.472β.
 2. Cyclobutadiene
1 2
4 3
 Eπ
 (Cyclobutadiene) = 4a + 4β (Refer Section 10.2.3)
 Delocalization energy = Eπ
 (Cyclobutadiene) – 2Eπ
 (Ethylene)
 = 4a + 4β – 2(2a + 2β) = 0
 Hence, in case of cyclobutadiene no stabilization of the molecule occurs 
due to delocalization energy.
3. Benzene
1
2
3
4
5
6
 Eπ 
(Benzene) = 6a + 8β (Refer Section 10.2.5)
 Delocalization energy of benzene will be with respect to three ethylene 
molecules because benzene contains six carbons atoms.
 Delocalization energy = Eπ 
(Benzene) – Eπ 
(Ethylene)
 = 6a + 8β – 3(2a + 2β)
 = 2β = 2 × (–75) kJ/mole = –150 kJ/mole
(Q β = –75 kJ/mole)
 Therefore, benzene molecule get stabilized by 2β over three ethylene 
molecules due to delocalization energy.

 2. What are the approximations suggested by Hückel to simplify the secular

molecule.
 Ans. Hückel molecular orbital approximations:
 1. All overlap integrals; Sij are assumed to be equal to zero.
 2. All orbitals are normalised i.e., Sii = 1.
 3. Hii is assumed to be same for all carbon atoms involved, which are in 
term represented by a (Coulomb integral).
 4. Hij = β, only if atoms i and j are bonded directly else all other Hij = 0.

 3. Why is the 1,3-butadiene molecule more stable than two ethene molecule?
 Ans. Energy of ethene molecule using HMO = (2a + 2β) 
 Energy for two ethene molecules = 2(2a + 2β)
 = (4a + 4β)
 However energy of butadiene molecule using HMO = (4a + 4.472 β).
 β is a negative quantity. Therefore, energy of 1,3-butadiene is less than that 
of two ethene molecules because of delocalization of π-electrons over the 
entire molecules in 1,3-butadiene.

rrr11.1 INTRODUCTION
Computational chemistry is solving a chemical system theoretically using 
quantum mechanical methods. We have already exactly solved a very simple 
system, i.e., hydrogen atom in previous chapter (refer chapter 7, hydrogen atom) 
which is one electron-one nuclei system. Though we have seen that more than 
one electron systems are difficult to solve exactly (refer chapter 8, i.e., multi 
electron system and approximate methods) due to the electron-electron repulsion 
term. However, use of some approximate methods do lead to their approximate 
solution, but their calculations are huge and complex. It is extremely difficult 
to solve bigger chemical systems manually as the solution to these systems 
are highly complex and difficult. Therefore, these calculations are performed 
computationally. The quantum mechanical approximate methods are applied 
computationally as set of instructions to generate solution for the system. 
Though, computationally solved systems give the theoretical solution of the 
system, they are not as reliable as experimental results. But serve great help 
in solving very slow reactions or reactions which are carried out at very high 
temperature, pressure etc. and expensive reactions. 
Computational chemistry serves not only as a cheap, less time consuming 
and user friendly branch but also helps as roadmap to the research and 
development of the chemical systems.
• The pioneering contributions of J.A. popleand his co-workers in U.S.A. 
has revolutionzed research in theoretical chemistry by using computation 
quantum chemistry since 1960. Since then the theories underlying the 
calculations have been evolved to the point at which a variety of important 
quantities can be obtained with sufficient accuracy to actually be of use. 
Also there have been a spectacular advances in computer hardware till 
now. Take together this means that good theories can now be routinely 
applied to real systems.
Basics of Computational 
Chemistry
11566 Chapter 11 Basics of Computational Chemistry
The questions commonly investigated computationally are:
 (a) Molecular Geometry: This tells us about the shape of the molecules, 
bond-lengths, bond angles and dihedral angles.
 (b) Energies of Molecules: This tells us which isomer is favoured at 
equilibrium. Their complexation, adsorption, distortion etc., energies.
 (c) Energies of Transition State: From the energy of reactant and transition 
state, it tells us how fast a reaction should go.
 (d) Chemical Reactivity: This tells us about where the electrons 
are concentrated (nucleophilic sites) and where they want to go 
(electrophilic sites) in a molecule. Thus, enables us to predict where 
various kinds to reagents will attack a molecule.
 (e) IR, UV and NMR Spectra: It helps of calculate the various spectra of 
the molecule with prominent intensities.
 (f) Interaction of a Substrate with an Enzyme: It helps in designing 
better drugs being seeing how a molecule fits into the active site of an 
enzyme.
 (g) Physical Properties of Substance: The physical properties of a 
substance depends on the properties of individual molecules and on 
how the molecules interact in the bulk material.
In studying these questions computational chemist have proposed a number 
of methods.
The various methods are:
 1. Molecular Mechanics (MM) method
 2. ab-initio method
 3. Semi-empirical method (SE)
 4. Density functional theory method (DFT)
11.2 POTENTIAL ENERGY SURFACE (PES)
The bond length, bond angle, dihedral angle etc. are the various reaction 
coordinates or geometric parameters. The graph of potential energy (E) against 
reaction coordinates or geometric coordinates is Potential Energy Surface (PES).
Like, for a diatomic molecule A-B, the PES can be shown as follows
(Fig. 11.1), where r
e
 is the equilibrium bond length.
E
re
A B
r
Bond length ( )r
Fig. 11.1. 1D PES in a 2D graph.11.2 Potential Energy Surface (PES) 567
There is a change in potential energy, if the bond length is stretched or 
compressed away from its equilibrium value (r
e
). Since a diatomic molecule 
A-B has only one geometric parameter i.e., bond length ‘r’ which can be varied. 
Thus, the above Figure (11.1) represent a one-dimensional (1D) PES in the 2D 
graph of PE Vs r.
For molecules having more than one geometric parameter, we have 2D 
PES in a 3D graph and a 3D PES in 4D graph. Like, for a triatomic molecule 
HOH, the geometry is defined by two equal bond lengths and one bond angle. 
Thus, the PES for this triatomic molecule is a graph of E Vs two geometric 
parameters (Fig. 11.2)
 r1
 = O—H bond length
and, r2
 = H—O—H bond angle.

Similarly, in a triatomic molecule HOF, the geometry is defined by three 
geometric parameters, the two different H—O and O—F bond lengths and the 
H—O—F bond angle. Thus, the PES for this triatomic molecule is a graph of 
E Vs three geometric parameters (Fig. 11.3)
 r1
 = H—O bond length,
 r2
 = O—F bond length
and r

For the above Fig. (11.3), we need four mutually perpendicular axes (for E, 
r
1
,r
2
 and r
3
). Such a 4D graph cannot be constructed in our 3D space. The 3D 
PES in 4D space is known as potential energy hyper surface.
11.3 STATIONARY POINT
• What is a stationary point?
A stationary point on a potential energy surface (PES) is a point at which 
the surface is flat. In other words, at stationary point the surface is parallel to 
the horizontal line corresponding to the geometric parameter.
Mathematically, a stationary point is one at which the first derivative of the 
potential energy with respect to geometric parameter is zero.
dE
dr1
 = 
dE
dr2
 = ......... = 0.
Actually, the stationary point corresponds to the geometry having minimum 
potential energy on a PES. Thus, in the PES of diatomic molecule A-B, the 
stationary point is the one at which dE
dr
 = 0. Similarly, on the PES of HOH, 
the stationary point corresponds to the point at which 
dE
dr1
 = 
dE
dr2
 = 0.
• There can be various types of stationary points:
Stationary point
Energy minima Saddle point
Global minimum Relative minimum
The actual molecules (reactants and products) have a finite lifetime, in 
contrast to transition state which exist only for an instant.
Energy minima or minima: The stationary point that corresponds to actual 
molecules (reactants and products) with a finite lifetime are called minima or 
energy minima. It occupies the lowest energy point in its region of the PES.
Global minimum: It is the lowest energy minimum on the whole PES.
Relative minimum: It is the minimum compared only to nearby points 
on the PES.
Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC): It is the lowest energy path followed 
by a molecule in going from one minimum to another minimum passing through 
the transition state. The transition state (TS) linking the two minima represents a 
maxima along the direction of IRC, but along all other directions it is a minima.11.4 Geometry Optimization 569
Saddle Point: The stationary point corresponding to transition state (which 
exists only for an instant) is called saddle point. Energy
Global minimum
Relative
minimum
T.S. (saddle point)
Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC)
Fig. 11.4. Various stationary points.
In computational chemistry, we essentially study the stationary points on a 
PES. In investigating chemical reactions, we study the passage of a molecule 
from a minimum through a transition state to another minimum.
11.4 GEOMETRY OPTIMIZATION
• Geometry optimization: Locating the stationary point on a PES i.e., 
demonstrating that the point in question exists and calculating its 
geometry and energy, is called geometry optimization.
Geometry optimization
Energy minimization
or minimization
Transition
state optimization
Energy minimization: Locating a minimum on a PES.
Transition state optimization: Locating a transition state on a PES.
• How geometry optimization is done?
First we make a Z-matrix of a molecule whose geometry optimization to be 
done. The Z-matrix specify the geometry by defining the various bond lengths, 
bond angles and dihedral angles, among the various atoms in a molecule. This 
Z-matrix prepared for a molecule gives a rough input structure. Starting with 
an input structure, that is believed to resemble the desired stationary point and 
then submitting this plausible structure to a computer algorithm (method) that 
systematically changes the geometry until it has found a stationary point. Like 
in a 1D PES of a diatomic molecule, one simply changes the bond length till 
that corresponds to the lowest energy is found.570 Chapter 11 Basics of Computational Chemistry
11.5 MOLECULAR MECHANICS (MM) METHOD
• Molecular mechanics (MM) is based on a mathematical model of a 
molecule as a collection of balls (corresponding to the atoms) held 
together by spring (corresponding to the bond). The energy of the 
molecule changes with geometry i.e., when the spring is stretched or bent 
away from natural length or angle. Thus Molecular mechanics (MM) uses 
a mechanical model of molecule to find its minimum energy geometry.
• Molecular mechanics (MM) expresses the energy of a molecule as a 
function of its resistance towards bond stretching, bond bending and 
atom crowding. It uses this energy equation to find the bond lengths, 
bond angles and dihedrals corresponds to the minimum energy geometry.
The form of the mathematical expression for the energy, and the parameters 
in it, constitute a force field. Thus, Molecular mechanics (MM) methods 
are sometimes called force field methods.

• Zero point energy (ZPE) or Zero point vibrational energy (ZPVE): 
There is always some kinetic energy due to the nuclear motion of the 
molecule. Thus, the molecule is never actually stationary with zero 
kinetic energy. This motion persists even at 0K, because the molecule 
vibrates even at this temperature. This unavoidable vibrational energy is 
called ZPE or ZPVE. This ZPE is calculated by frequency calculations 
of the molecule. Thus frequencies must be calculated to get the ZPE 
of the molecule. No ZPE’s are added in the energy expression of 
molecular mechanics (MM).
• The MM method makes no reference to electrons i.e., clearly ignores 
electrons and so cannot throw light on electric properties like charge 
distribution, nucleophilic and electrophilic behaviour and electronic spectra.
• In the IR spectra, the MM can calculate the frequencies but not the 
intensities of the bands. Since intensity depends on the change in dipole 11.5 Molecular Mechanics (MM) Method 571
moment and dipole moment is related to electron distribution and MM 
ignores electrons.
• MM method is not a quantum mechanical method because it does not 
use Schrodinger equation to calculate energy.
• Some of the MM series of programs are MM1, MM2, MM3, MM4, 
SYLBYL, UFF, MMFF, CHARMM, AMBER.
11.5.1 Applications of MM Method
 1. It helps to calculate the reasonably good geometries and thus energies 
of small (C1
–C10) to medium sized (C11–C100) molecules. The MM 
calculations on small to medium sized molecules are fast and very 
accurate.
 The MM programs for small to medium sized molecules are probably 
MM2 and MM3.
 2. It is most widely used method for computing the geometries and energies 
of large biological molecules (more than about 100 heavy atoms) like 
proteins, nucleic acid, polyaccharides and steroid (e.g., cholesterol). 
The MM programs for these polymers are CHARMM and AMBER 
(Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement).
 3. An extremely important aspect of the modelling (which is done largely 
by MM method) of biomolecules is designing pharmacologically active 
molecules that can fit into active sites of biomolecules and serve as 
useful drugs. The computationally assisted design of new drugs 
and study of the relationship of structure to activity is known as 
QSAR (quantitative structure—activity relationship). It is one of the 
most active areas of computational chemistry.
 4. It helps to calculate the geometries and energies of transition state.
 5. It helps to calculate DE, DH, DS and DG.
 6. Since MM method can calculate the geometries and energies of 
molecules and transition state, thus it helps in planning synthesis. Thus, 
it acts as an aid to organic synthesis.
 7. The most frequent use of MM method is to obtain reasonable starting 
structures for most of the quantum mechanical calculations i.e., ab intio, 
Semi-empirical and Density functional theory method.
 8. MM is fast and accurate. A fairly large molecule like a polysaccharide 
can be optimized in seconds. It takes very less time in optimization of 
even very large molecules.
 9. It also helps to calculate IR spectra with some accuracy. The frequency 
calculations consume more time than geometry optimization.572 Chapter 11 Basics of Computational Chemistry
 10. It does not give UV, NMR or ESR spectra.
11. It does not help in calculating any ionization energy or electron affinities.
11.6 AB-INITIO METHOD
• Schrodinger equation is the heart of quantum mechanics. The equation 
describes how the electron behaves in a molecule and consider electron 
as a wave.
• The ab-initio method is based on quantum mechanics and thus it is 
a quantum mechanical method. The ab-initio method solves the 
Schrodinger equation for a molecule and gives us the molecular energy 
(E) and wavefunction (ψ).
• The Schrodinger equation cannot be solved exactly for any molecule 
with more than one electron. Thus, approximations are used, to solve the 
Schrodinger equation having more than electron. More the approximations 
used, the higher the level of ab-initio method.
• ab-initio method is a quantum mechanical approach and does not rely 
on calibration against measured chemical parameters and is therefore 
called ab-initio meaning “from the first”.
• ab-initio method is relatively slow though accurate.
 Speed : MM > SE > DFT > ab-initio.
 (100 times) (100–1000 times)
 Accuracy : ab-initio > DFT > SE > MM.
• It is used for computing the geometries and energies of small to medium 
sized molecules at a reasonably high level, in minutes. For a fairly large 
molecule like a steroid, the calculations for geometries and energies 
could take perhaps few weeks.
• It is also used to measure the IR spectra and thus vibrational frequencies 
of small molecules at a reasonable high level in minutes but a fairly large 
molecule (like a steroid) could take weeks. Thus, ab-initio method is 
good for small to medium sized molecules.
• All the electrons are considered in ab-initio calculations.
• The simplest kind of ab-initio calculation is Hartree self-consistent 
field (Hartree SCF) procedure. The impossibility of an exact solution 
of Schrodinger equation to polyelectronic system due to electron-electron 
repulsion term prompted Hartree’s approach, for calculating ψ and E for 
polyelectronic system.
In Hartree SCF procedure, we write a plausible approximate polyelectronic 
wavefunction (a “guess”) for an atom as the product of one electron 
wavefunction.
Ψ0
 = ψ0
(1) · ψ0
(2) · ψ0
(3) … ψ0
(n)11.6 ab-initio Method 573
This wavefunction is called Hartree product or Hartree wavefunction.
 Here, Ψ0
 is a function of the coordinates of all the electrons in the 
atom, ψ0
(1) is a function of the coordinates of electron 1, ψ0
(2) is the 
function of the coordinates of electron 2, etc. These one-electron functions 
ψ0
(1), ψ0
(2), etc. are called atomic orbitals (molecular orbitals if we were 
dealing with a molecule). The initial guess Ψ0
, is our zeroth approximation 
to the true total wavefunction Ψ. It is zeroth because we have not yet 
started to refine it with the Hartree process. To apply the Hartree process, 
we first solve for electron 1, a one-electron Schrodinger equation in 
which the electron-electron repulsion comes from electron 1 and an 
average, smeared out electrostatic field due to all the other electrons. The 
only moving particle in this equation is electron 1. Solving this equation 
gives Ψ1
(1) from Ψ0
(i). Next, we solve for electron 2, a one-electron 
Schrodinger equation with electron 2 moving in an average field due to 
the electrons of ψ1
(1), ψ0
(3), …, ψ0
(n). Similarly we continue to electron 
n moving in a field due to ψ1
(1), ψ1
(2), …, ψ1
(n – 1).
 This completes the first cycle of calculations and gives
Ψ1
= ψ1
(1) · ψ1
(2) · ψ1
(3) … ψ1
(n)
 Repetition of the cycle gives
Ψ2
 = ψ2
(1) · ψ2
(2) · ψ2
(3) … ψ2
(n)
The process is continued for ‘k’ cycles till we have a function Ψk
 and an 
energy calculated for Ψk
 are essentially the same as from the previous 
cycle. At this stage, the field of cycle k is essentially the same as that 
of cycle (k – 1) i.e., it is consistent with the previous field, and so the 
Hartree SCF procedure is called the self-consistent field procedure or 
SCF procedure. 
There are two problems with the Hartree SCF procedure:
 1. The electrons have a property called spin and the electron spin was not 
taken into account by Hartree.
 2. Hartree wavefunction was symmetrical with respect to electron exchange 
i.e., electrons are taken to be indistinguishable. Whereas, the experiments 
shows that electronic wavefunction are actually antisymmetric with respect 
to electron exchange.
 The above defects of Hartree SCF procedure were corrected by Fock and 
Slater in 1930. Slater gave a simple way to construct a total wavefunction 
from one-electron spatial functions (i.e., atomic orbitals or molecular 
orbitals) such that total wavefunction will be antisymmetric to electron 
exchange. The Hartree wavefunction is a product of one-electron function 574 Chapter 11 Basics of Computational Chemistry
called orbitals or spatial function, these are the functions of the usual space 
coordinates x, y, z. Whereas, the Slater wavefunction is composed, not just 
of spatial function but also of spin function.
 Hartree wavefunction = ψtotal = ψspatial function
 Slater wavefunction = ψtotal = ψspatial function · ψspin function
The Slater wavefunction differs from the Hartree wavefunction not only 
in being composed of spin function rather than just spatial function, but also 
in the fact that it is not a simple product of one-electron functions, but rather a 
determinant whose elements are these functions. The Slater wavefunction can 
be Slater determinant. The Slater determinant ensures that:
 1. There are not more than two electrons in each spatial orbital.
 2. Total wavefunction is antisymmetric since switching two electrons amounts 
to exchanging two rows of the determinant and this changes its sign.
 3. It also explains the Pauli’s exclusion principle.
In quantum mechanics, for every observable i.e., every measurable property 
of a system, has a quantum mechanical operator from which the property could 
be calculated.
Like: Hˆ ψ = Eψ
This equation is an eigen value equation. The expectation value of the 
energy operator Ĥ is the energy (E) of the atom or molecule. This energy (E) 
will be exact and true energy of the molecule only if the wavefunction (ψ) and 
the Hamiltoninan (Ĥ) operator are exact.
Similarly, there is a Fock operator ˆ
( ) F , which is a one-electron operator, 
unlike the general electronic Hamiltonian operator (Ĥ), which is a multi-electron 
operator. Thus, the Fock operator when operates on Slater wavefunction leads 
to Hartree Fock (HF) equation
 Fˆψ 
= εψ
The Hartree Fock (HF) equations are pseudoeigen value equations.
In an eigen value equation, the operator is not dependent on the wavefunction 
on which it acts. But HF equations are pseudoeigen value equations because the 
operator Fˆ
 depends on ψ, since Fˆ contains ˆJ and Kˆ
 which in turn depends 
on ψ.
Fˆ

HF equations allows us to calculate the wavefunction (ψ) and the energy 
levels (ε). These equations work in exactly the same spirit as the Hartree self 
consistent field procedure i.e., iterative method. The process is continued until 11.6 ab-initio Method 575

. no longer change and is consistent from one iteration cycle to the next 
i.e. self-consistent. The main difference between the two methods i.e. Hartree 
SCF procedure and HF method is that HF method represent wavefunction as a 
Slater determinant of spin atomic or molecular orbitals rather than as a simple 
product of spatial atomic or molecular orbitals.
The problem with HF equations is that the wavefucntion used is so 
complicated that they contribute nothing to a qualitative understanding of the 
electron distribution. Thus, Roothaan and Hall independently pointed out 
that these problems can be solved by representing molecular orbitals as linear 
combination of atomic orbitals or basis functions. The basis functions are 
located on atoms and thus we are expanding each molecular orbital in terms 
of m basis functions.
ψi
 = 
s
m
Csi s
=
∑
1
φ i = 1, 2, 3, …, m
The set of basis functions used for a particular calculation is called basis set.
Actually atomic orbitals are basis function and molecular orbitals are 
basis set.
Even the smallest basis set used in ab-initio method for each atom has atleast 
one basis function corresponding to each atomic orbital and the number of basis 
function (φ) is equal to the number of molecular orbitals (ψ).
Like: For CH4
 molecule, there are nine basis functions, φ (5 on carbon atom 
i.e., 1s, 2s, 2px
, 2py
, 2pz
 and 4 on hydrogen atom i.e. 1s on each hydrogen atom), 
which create nine spatial molecular orbitals, ψ, which could hold 18 electrons. 
But for the 10 electrons of CH4
, we need only five spatial molecular orbitals. 
The other four spatial molecular orbitals which are unoccupied are Virtual 
molecular orbitals.
The occupied spatial molecular orbitals are used to construct the Slater 
determinant which represent the HF wavefunction. Thus, there is no upper limit 
to the size of a basis set. There are commonly many more basis functions, and 
hence molecular orbitals than are needed to hold all the electrons. Thus, by 
substituting molecular orbitals as linear combination of basis function in HF 
equations, we obtain Roothan-Hall equations. The Roothan-Hall equations 
can be expressed as
 Fc = Scε
where C = coefficient; ε = molecular energy; F and S are integrals.
Roothaan-Hall equation like HF equations are pseudoeigen value equation 
since they contain Fˆ which is dependent on ψ.
Roothan-Hall iterative process (initial guess, first F, first cycle C’s; second 
F, second cycle C’s; third F etc.) is therefore a self-consistent procedure or SCF 
procedure, like the HF procedure or Hartree SCF procedure.576 Chapter 11 Basics of Computational Chemistry
Roothan-Hall equations are also called as Hartree-Fock-Roothan 
equations or Roothaan equations

• Hartree Fock energies: HF electronic energy ( EHF
electronic ) of a molecule 
or atom is the sum of the kinetic energy (energy of the electrons due 
to their motion) and potential energy (energy due to electron-nucleus 
attraction and energy due to electron-electron repulsion).
electronic EHF = K.E. + P.E.
The total energy of the molecule (EHF
total) however, involves not just the 
electrons but also the nuclei, which contributes potential energy due to 
internuclear repulsion (Vnn
). Thus, adding the HF electronic energy and 
the internuclear repulsion gives total EHF or HF energy
EHF
total
= E V HF nn
electronic +
The EHF
total
 is the energy usually displayed at the end of a HF calculation, 
called the HF energy. 
There is also kinetic energy due to the nuclear motion of the molecule. 
This motion persists even at 0K, because the molecule vibrates even at 
this temperature. This unavoidable vibrational energy is called zero-point 
vibrational energy (ZPVE) or zero point energy (ZPE).11.6 ab-initio Method 577
The total energy including ZPE is ZPE-corrected energy ( ) EHF
total
. It is 
actually the total internal energy of the molecule at 0K.

This ZPE is calculated by frequency calculations of the molecule. The 
ZPE calculations are valid only for a stationary point on the potential energy 
surface (PES). For accurate work, it is usual to compare ZPE-corrected 
ab-initio energy ( ) E0K
total
. So, ZPE is needed for accurate energy calculations. 
ZPE-corrected ab-initio energies is preferred for calculating relative energies. 
We are never interested in absolute ab-initio energies but in relative energies.

In ab-initio, energy difference are in Hartrees, which is then converted into 
kJ/mole.
• Other than HF method, there is another ab-initio method for calculating 
molecular geometries and molecular energies and that is MP2 method 
or correlation method. The HF method does not account properly for 
electron correlation. The MP2 method is the only simplest approach for 
handling electron correlation.

The geometries obtained after geometry optimization are much better 
with MP2 than with HF calculations. Also, MP2 geometries for transition 
state are significantly better in general, than HF ones.578 Chapter 11 Basics of Computational Chemistry
• High Accuracy Energy Calculations: Energy difference (relative 
energy) with an error of ±10 kJ/mole is said to be within chemical 
accuracy. The ab-initio energies and methods required for results of 
chemical accuracy are called high-accuracy energies and methods. High 
accuracy energy method are based on high-level correlation methods and 
big basis sets
 There are two classes of popular high-accuracy energy methods:
 (a) Pople group’s G2 and G3 methods (for Gaussain-2 and Gaussain-3)
 G3 method is somewhat more accurate than G2.
 (b) Peterson group’s CBS method (CBS = complete basis set).
There are three basic CBS methods:
CBS–4, CBS–Q and CBS–APNO or CBS–QCI/APNO.
Since, application of such computational levels require unreasonable time, 
thus the calculations are broken up into several steps.
• ab-initio Vibrational Frequency Calculations: Frequencies should be 
calculated at the same level as it was done for the geometry optimization. 
However, frequency calculations take longer time than geometry 
optimization. Frequency calculations are important because:
 (i) The number of imaginary frequencies tells us whether an optimized 
structure (i.e. stationary point) is a minimum or a transition state.
 (ii) The frequencies must be calculated to get the ZPE of the molecule. 
This is needed for accurate energy comparisons.
 (iii) The normal-mode vibrational frequencies corresponds to the bands 
in the IR spectrum of the substance, which serve as a guide for the 
experimentalist.
 Calculated and observed frequencies differ by a fairly constant factor 
and ab-initio frequencies can be brought into reasonable agreement with 
experimental values by multiplying them by a correction factor
 vexperimental = v
observed × correction factor
In the software, approximations are made. Therefore, energy and 
frequency values are never close to real values. So, values obtained are 
multiplied by a correction factor to make it correspond to real values.
The bands in IR spectrum have not just positions (i.e., wavenumber), 
but also intensities. For comparing an IR spectrum with experimental 
spectra, it is important to compute both wavenumbers and intensities. The 
intensity of an IR band is determined by the change in dipole moment 
accompanying the vibration. The HF level calculated IR-band intensities 
differ from experiment by a factor of over 100%, but the MP2 level are 
typically within 30% of experiment.11.7 Semi-Empirical Method 579
11.6.1 Applications of ab-initio Method
Instead of finding the shapes (geometries), the relative energies, IR spectra, and 
the frequencies of stationary points (usually minima and transition state) on a 
PES, there are various other applications of ab-initio calculations.
 1. It helps to calculate DE, DH, DS and DG at 0K.
 2. It helps in calculating the distribution of electron density in a molecule. 
This calculation of electron density distribution enables us to predict the 
dipole moment, electrical charges, bond order, electrostatic potential 
(ESP) charges and atoms in molecules (AIM).
 3. It helps in calculating the UV spectra/Electronic spectra using 
configuration interation (CIS) method and NMR spectra.
 NMR spectra can be calculated with remarkable accuracy even at the 
HF level, and also improved results are obtained using the MP2 method.
 4. It helps in calculating frequencies in IR spectra and Raman spectra.
 5. It helps in calculating ionization energies (using Koppman’s theorem) 
and electron affinity. High accuracy ionization energies and electron 
affinities can be calculated by the G2 method or one of the CBS methods.
• Weakness of ab-initio calculation: Compared to other methods (MM, 
Semi-empirical and DFT), ab-initio calculations are slow and relatively 
more demanding for computer sources.
11.7 SEMI-EMPIRICAL METHOD
• Empirical means experimental. It is mixing of theory and experiment 
that makes the method Semi-empirical. The Semi-empirical method 
is based on parameterization. The plugging of experimental values 
into a mathematical procedure to get the best calculated value is called 
parameterization.
• Semi-empirical method like ab-initio method are based on Schrondiger 
equation. Semi-empirical method is regarded as simplification of ab-initio
method. The ab-initio method is based on Schrodinger equation (i.e.,
quantum mechanical method) and very complicated integrals are solved 
here. Whereas, Semi-empirical calculations are also based on Schrodinger 
equation but are much less demanding than ab-initio because more 
approximations are made in Semi-empirical method, which drastically 
reduce the number of integrals which are actually calculated in ab-initio
method.
• ab-initio method can examine moderately large molecules like steroids 
with about 30 heavy atoms. Whereas, by Semi-empirical method huge 
molecules like proteins and nuclei acid can be examined.580 Chapter 11 Basics of Computational Chemistry
• Both ab-initio and Semi-empirical method uses the SCF procedure to 
refine the Fock matrix to obtain energy levels and MO coefficients. In 
ab-initio method, all the integrals of Fock matrix are evaluated, whereas 
in Semi-empirical method, we do not evaluate these matrix elements.
• MM method starts with a model of a molecule as balls and springs, a 
model that works but whose theoretical justification lies outside MM. 
Similarly, ab-initio method, starts with Schrodinger equation but does not 
appeal to experiment. Whereas, SE method stand in contrast to empirical 
(experimental) method like MM and theoretical method, like ab-initio
method. SE calculations are 100–1000 times faster than ab-initio or DFT 
method.
• SE method is different from ab-initio method in the sense that:
 1. In ab-initio method, all the electrons are considered and nucleus is taken 
as “core”. Whereas in SE method, valence electrons and π electrons are 
considered and nucleus as well inner electrons is taken as “core”.
 2. The total electronic ab-initio energy is given as
ab-initio energy: EHF
total
 = E V HF nn
electronic
(nuclear-nuclear repulsion)
+
 w hereas, the total Semi-empirical energy corresponds to valence 
electronic energy and is given as:
 SE energy: ESE
total
 = E V SE cc
electronic
(core-core repulsion)
+
 Thus, SCF Semi-empirical energy is calculated in a similar manner to 
that of an ab-initio calculations.
 3. In ab-initio method, the basis set function (mathematical function used 
to expand molecular orbitals) is very large because in this we need 
basis function (atomic orbitals) for all the electrons. Whereas, in Semi￾empirical method, the basis set is small compared to ab-initio method, 
since in Semi-empirical we need the basis function (valence atomic 
orbitals or pi atomic orbitals) for the valence electrons only.
 4. In ab-initio method, Gaussian functions (G2 and G3) are used since 
large number of integrals are to be solved. Whereas, in Semi-empirical 
method, Slater function are used because in this integrals are reduced 
by making approximations.
• Various types of SCF type Semi-empirical methods used are:
 1. Parsier-Parr-Popple (PPP) Method: It was the first SCF-type Semi￾empirical method. In this method, the calculations are limited to only 
pi-electrons, with the other electrons forming a sigma framework. 
This method has been used to calculate the UV spectra of conjugated 
compounds, especially dyes.11.7 Semi-Empirical Method 581
 2. The Complete Neglect of Differential Overlap (CNDO) Method: It 
was the first SCF-type Semi-empirical method which goes beyond pi 
electrons. There are two versions of CNDO:
 (a) CNDO/1
 (b) CNDO/2 (more improved version)
 3. The Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap (INDO) Method:
In PPP and CNDO method, the two-electron repulsion integrals are 
reduced by applying ZDO approximation. Whereas, INDO goes beyond 
PPP and CNDO by not applying the ZDO approximation. INDO is more 
accurate than CNDO. It is used mostly for calculating UV spectra.
 There are two versions of INDO:
 (a) INDO/S
 (b) ZINDO/S
 4. The Neglect of Diatomic Differential Overlap (NDDO) Method:
NDDO based popular Semi-empirical method was developed by Dewar 
and coworkers, they are classified as:
 (a)	Modified	NDDO		(MNDO): It is used to calculate heat of formation 
(DH°f
), geometry, dipole moment and first ionization energy.
 (b) Austin Method 1 (AM1): It is an improved version of MNDO 
and the results are slightly better than those of MNDO. It helps in 
geometry optimization of the molecule. The real advantage of AM1 
over MNDO were said to lie in its better treatment of hydrogen￾bonding, crowded molecules, four-membered rings and activation 
energy.
 (c) Parametric Method 3 (PM3): PM3 is a variation of AM1, 
differing in how the parameterization is done. It also helps in 
geometry optimization of the molecule. PM3 was only a marginal 
improvement over AM1 but AM1 largely replaced MNDO.
 (d) Semi ab-initio Method Number 1 (SAM1): It is essentially a 
modification of AM1. It is twice as slow as AM1. One of the main 
reasons for developing SAM1 was to improve the treatment of 
hydrogen bonding and SAM1 is indeed an improvement over AM1.
11.7.1 Applications of Semi-Empirical Method
 1. It helps to calculate the reasonably good geometries and thus energies 
of small to medium sized molecules as well as large biomolecules (like 
proteins and nucleic acids) which were limited to molecular mechanics, 
can now be done with Semi-empirical method using MOZYME program
 The most widely used Semi-empirical methods, AM1 and PM3 
calculates heat of formation at room temperature, 298 K. Absolute 582 Chapter 11 Basics of Computational Chemistry
energies are not calculated but relative energies are calculated at room 
temperature. During AM1 calculations, zero point energy (ZPE) is not 
considered, since parameterization is taken into account.
 In Semi-empirical method, energy differences are measured in kJ/mole. 
Actually, AM1 and PM3 mainly gives good geometries but energies of 
only moderate quality.
 2. It helps to calculate the geometries and energies of transition state.
 3. It helps to calculate DE, DH, DS and DG at 298 K.
 4. Semi-empirical methods (AM1 and PM3) are used to calculate the 
vibrational frequency and thus the IR spectrum of the substance, which 
serve as a guide for experimentalist. The Semi-empirical frequencies 
(and wavenumber) are used to characterize a species as a minimum or 
a transition state. The intensities of an IR band is also determined by 
the change in dipole moment accompanying the vibration.
 5. It helps in calculating the distribution of electron density in a molecule. 
This distribution of electron density enables us to predict the dipole 
moment, electrical charges, bond orders, and electrostatic potential 
(ESP) charges.
 6. It helps in calculating the UV spectra/Electronic spectra. The Semi￾empirical UV spectra are usually calculated using INDO/S or ZINDO/S, 
both of which are in hyperchem. The ZINDO/S spectrum resembles the 
experimental spectrum considerably better than does the ab-initio one.
 7. NMR spectrum cannot be measured by Semi-empirical method.
 8. It helps in calculating ionisation energies (using Koopman’s theorem) 
and electron affinity.
11.8 DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY (DFT) METHOD
• Both the ab-initio and semi-empirical approaches calculate molecular 
wavefunction (ψ) and thus represent wavefunction method. Whereas, 
density functional theory is not based on the wavefunction, but rather 
depends on electron probability density function or electron density 
function or electron density or charge density, (r(x, y, z) or r(r)). 
Charge density is basically the probability of finding an electron per unit 
volume; its unit is (volume) –1 and it is a pure number.
The wavefunction calculated in ab-initio and semi-empirical method is 
not an experimental observable. Wavefunction of N electron molecule 
is a function of 4N variables i.e., 3N spatial coordinates and lN spin 
coordinate for each electron. Whereas the electron density calculated 
in density function theory is an experimental observable and can be 
measured by X-ray diffraction or electron diffraction. The electron density 11.8 Density Functional Theory (DFT) method 583
is a function of only three position variables i.e., x, y, z. Thus, a function 
of three variables calculates the properties of atoms and molecules from 
the electron density.
• The complexity of the wavefunction increases with the number of 
electrons. Thus electron density approach is an improvement on 
wavefunction method.
• The main advantage of DFT is that in less time, it gives accurate results. 
In other words, in about the same time needed for the HF calculations, we 
can obtain results of about the same quality as from MP2 calculations.
• ab-initio is based on Hartree-Fock (HF) equations, which on solution 
gives wavefunction (ψ) and energy (E) for the system. Whereas, density 
functional theory is based on Kohn-Sham (KS) equations, which on 
solution gives electron density (r0
) and energy (E0
).
• The current DFT calculations on molecules are based on Kohn-Sham 
approach. This Kohn-Sham approach is based on two theorems published 
by Hohenberg and Kohn, known as Hohenberg-Kohn Theorems.
Theorem I:First Hohenberg-Kohn Theorem. It states that the properties 
of a molecule in a ground electronic state is determined by the ground 
state electron density function i.e. r0
 (x, y, z). In other words, if r0
 (x, y, z) 
is given, we can calculate the ground state property like, energy (E0
).
 r0
 (x, y, z) → E0
The problem with this theorem was that it is merely an existence theorem. 
It tells that some property exists but it does not tells us how to find 
the property. But, it simply assures us that there is a way to calculate 
molecular properties from electron density function.
Theorem II: Second Hohenberg-Kohn Theorem. It is similar to the 
variation theorem. It states that any trial electron density function (rt
) 
will give an energy higher than the ground state energy or equal, if it 
was exactly the true electron density function (r0
).
 Et
[rt
] ≥ E0
[r0
]
 Also the trial electron density (rt
) must satisfy the condition
i.e., ∫
ρt
( )r dr = n
 where, n is the number of electrons in the molecule. This condition is 
similar to the wavefunction normalization condition.
• Kohn-Sham (KS) Equations: Like in ab-initio method, the Hartree-Fock 
iterative method leads to HF-equations, which are then used to calculate 
the wavefunction and energy.584 Chapter 11 Basics of Computational Chemistry
 In current molecular DFT calculations, a similar iterative method leads 
to KS equations. We use an initial guess of the electron density [r] in 
the KS equations (similar to HF equations) to calculate the initial guess 
of the KS orbitals, this initial guess is then used to refine these orbitals, 
in a manner similar to that used in the HF-SCF method. The iterative 
process of solving KS equations being continued until the electron density 
converge and therefore called SCF-KS method. The final KS orbitals are 
used to calculate an electron density [r0
] that in turn is used to calculate 
the energy (E0
).
 The KS equation can be written as:
ˆKS KS (1) (1) h i
⋅ ψ = ε ψ i i
KS KS
⋅ ( )1 ; where ˆKS h = KS operator
• Kohn-Sham (KS) Energy: Just like HF energies, the KS electronic 
energy electronic
KS ( ) E of a molecule or atom is the sum of the kinetic energy 
(energy of the electrons due to their motion) and potential energy (energy 
due to electron-nucleus attraction and energy due to electron-electron 
repulsion)
EKS
electronic = K.E. + P.E.
(or) E0 = T[r0
] + Vne
[r0
] + Vee
[r0
] + EXC[r0
]
 where E0
 is the ground state KS electronic energy and Exc
[r0
] is the 
exchange-correlation energy functional.
The total energy of the molecule ( ) EKS
total
, however involves not just the 
electrons but also the nuclei, which contributes potential energy due to 
internuclear repulsion (Vnn
 ). Thus, adding KS electronic energy and the 
internuclear repulsion, gives EKS
total
 or KS energy
EKS

EKS

 is the energy usually displayed at the end of KS calculations, called 
the KS energy.
There is also kinetic energy due to the nuclear motion of the molecule. 
This motion persists even at 0K because the molecule vibrates even at 
this temperature. This unavoidable energy is called zero-point vibrational 
energy (ZPVE) or zero-point energy (ZPE).
The total energy including ZPE is ZPE-corrected energy (E0K
total). It is 
actually the total internal energy of the molecule at 0K.
E0K

total
 + (ZPE × Correction factor)
The ZPE is calculated by frequency calculations of the molecule. For 
accurate work, it is usual to compare ZPE-corrected energy ( ) E0K

. So 
ZPE is needed for accurate energy calculations.11.8 Density Functional Theory (DFT) method 585
• The HF equations would not give the exact energy in the ab-initio
calculations as it does not treat electron correlation properly. But KS 
equations would give exact energy if we know the exact value of EXC 
and r0
.
The main problem in the DFT method is devising accurate exchange￾correlation energy, EXC from the electron density function [r0
]. This term 
is most subject to error as it is relatively small. Since it is a small term, 
thus even moderately large errors in this term will not introduce large 
errors into the total energy.
• Methods or Approximations to calculate exchange-correlation energy 
functional, EXC[r0
]:
 1. The Local Density Approximation (LDA): This is the simplest 
approximation to EXC[r0
]. For the LDA, the exchange-correlation 
energy functional (EXC
LDA) can be accurately determined. The Xa method 
of Slater is a special case of the LDA, in which the correlation part 
of the exchange-correlation functional is neglected and the exchange 
functional used is
EXC

 = E r X dr Xα
π





 ∫

3 4 3 [ ( )] /
 The parameter a is empirical; whose value from 1 to 2/3 gives reasonable 
results for atoms.
 Usually the LDA approximation applies to a UEG, (uniform electron 
gas) where the electron density, (r (r)), varies only very slowly with 
position.
 2. Local Spin Density Approximation (LSDA): This approximation 
gives better results than LDA. In this the spin part of the electron is 
also taken into correlation. The advantage of LSDA is that it can handle 
systems with one or more unpaired electrons, like radicals and systems 
in which electrons are becoming unpaired.
 For species in which all the electrons are paired, the LSDA is equivalent 
to LDA. Like LDA, EXC
LSDA can also be accurately determined.
 3. Generalized-Gradient Approximation (GGA): According to this 
approximation, the exchange-correlation energy functional, (EXC), 
can be written as the sum of an exchange-energy functional (EX
) and 
a correlation-energy functional (EC
)
i.e., EXC = EX
 + EC
 Further, this approximation says that Exc
 not only utilize electron density 
but also its gradient. These functionals are called gradient-corrected 586 Chapter 11 Basics of Computational Chemistry
functionals or non-local functionals. So for calculating EXC, we 
did not simply use exchange-energy functional (EX
) or correlation￾energy functional (EC
), but, we use gradient corrected exchange-energy 
functional or gradient-corrected correlation energy functional.
• Examples of some gradient corrected exchange-energy functional are:
 HF functional, Slater functional, Perdew-Wang 91 functional, PBE–96
 functional, HCTH–98 functional, Becke 88 functional (B88 or B), Gill 
1996 functional (G96), Becke 1993 functional (B3).
• Examples of some gradient corrected correlation energy functional are:
 VWM ≠ 5 functional, Perdew-Zunger–81 functional, HCTH–98 
functional, PBE–96 functional, Perdew-Wang–91 functional, Lee-Yang￾Parr 1988 (LYP) functional, Perdew 1986 (P86) functional.
• Gradient corrected hybrid DFT functionals:
 A calculation with B88 for EX
 and P86 for EC
 is called B88–P86 or B88 
P86 or BP86 in Gaussian program.
 Similarly, a calculation with B88 for EX
 and LYP for EC would be 
designated as B88LYP or BLYP.
The most popular DFT functional at present is based on an EX
 developed 
by Becke in 1993 (B3) and EC developed by LYP1998. These two are 
then designated as Becke-3LYP or B3LYP.
11.8.1 Applications of Density Functional Theory Method
 1. It helps to calculate the reasonably good geometries and thus energies 
of small to medium sized molecules. It calculates the heat of formation 
at 0K. Absolute energies are also calculated but relative energies are 
calculated at 0K.
 2. It helps to calculate the geometries and energies of transition state.
 3. It helps to calculate DH, DE, DS and DG at 0K.
 4. DFT methods are used to calculate the vibrational frequency and 
thus the IR spectrum of the substance, which serves as a guide for 
experimentalist. The intensities of an IR band is also determined by 
the change in dipole moment accompanying the vibration.
 5. It helps in calculating the distribution of electron density in a molecule. 
This distribution of electron density enables us to predict the dipole 
moment, electrical charges, bond order, electrostatic potential (ESP) 
charges and atoms in molecules (AIM).
 6. It does not help to measure the UV spectra/Electronic spectra.
 7. It helps to measure the NMR spectra.
 8. It also enables us to calculate the ionization energy and electron 
affinities.11.9 Basis Set 587
11.9 BASIS SET
Developed by Pople and coworkers
• Basis function + Basis function =
(atomic orbital) (atomic orbital)
Basis set
(molecular orbital)
• There are two types of basis function that are currently used in molecular 
calculations:
 (a) Gaussian function
 (b) Slater function
• Slater functions are used in Semi-empirical calculations and Gaussian 
functions are used in ab-initio calculations.
• Gaussian functions differ from Slater function in the fact that in the 
Gaussian function, the exponent involves the square of the distance of 
the electron from the point (usually an atomic nucleus) on which the 
basis function (atomic orbital) is centred.
Example:
 s-type Slater function: φ = ae(–br)
 s-type Gaussian function: φ = ae(–br2
)
• The basis function (atomic orbital) describes the distribution of electron 
around an atom and combining basis function i.e., basis set yields the 
electron distribution in the molecule (molecular orbital) as a whole. Thus, 
basis set is a set of mathematical functions (basis function), whose linear 
combination yields molecular orbitals.
• The basis functions are not necessarily conventional atomic orbitals, 
they can be any set of mathematical functions that are convenient to 
manipulate and which on linear combination give useful representations 
of molecular orbitals.
• Although Slater functions are better than Gaussian functions but 
we use Gaussian functions. This can be explained as follows:
Slater functions are good approximation to atomic wavefunction and 
would be the natural choice for ab-initio basis functions but this is not 
so since the evaluation of certain two-electron integrals require excessive 
computer time if Slater functions are used. These integrals are readily 
evaluated with Gaussian basis functions. Gaussian functions are much 
faster calculated than Slater functions. But, again a single Gaussian 
is a poor approximation to the nearly ideal description to an atomic 
wavefunction that a Slater wavefunction provides. The solution to the 
problem of this poor functional behaviour is to use several Gaussians 
to approximate a Slater function. Thus, instead of a single Gaussian, 
a linear combination of Gaussians have been used to approximate the 
Slater function, giving rise to basis set. Basis set is linear combination 
of basis function.588 Chapter 11 Basics of Computational Chemistry
 For example:
 STO-1G: Slater Type Orbital approximated by one Gaussian
 STO-3G: Slater Type Orbital approximated by three Gaussian.
The STO-3G basis set is a Contracted Gaussian consisting of three 
Primitive Gaussians which has contraction coefficients (0.446, 0.5353 
and 0.1543).
3G
Contacted
Guassian
↓
 = 0.446gA
 + 0.5353gB
 + 0.1543gC
 Primitive Gaussians each having
 its contraction coefficients
Thus, with Contracted Gaussians as basis function, each two-electron 
Slater integral (present in Slater function) becomes a sum of easily 
calculated two-centre two-electron Gaussian integrals. These Gaussian 
integrals can be evaluated so much faster than Slater integrals. Thus, 
the use of contracted Gaussians instead of Slater function speed up the 
calculation of the integrals enormously, despite the larger number of 
integrals. Fast calculation of integrals is particularly important for the 
two-electron integrals, as their number increases rapidly with the size 
of the molecule.
• Types of basis set and their uses: The basis set commonly used in 
calculations are:
S. No. Basis set Uses of Basis set
1. STO–1G It means Slater Type Orbital approximated by one 
Gaussian. It is the simplest possible Gaussian basis set. 
A single Gaussian gives a poor representation of a Slater 
function, thus STO–1G basis, although it was useful for 
illustrative purposes, is not used in research calculations.
2. STO-3G The STO–1G basis set can be improved by using a linear 
combination of three Gaussians, thus STO–3G was given.
It means Slater-Type Orbital approximated by three 
Gaussians. The STO–3G basis set introduces the concept of 
constructing contracted Gaussians from primitive Gaussians. 
It is the minimal basis set. i.e., it is probably the smallest 
basis set. One of the advantage of STO–3G basis set is its 
speed, it is roughly twice as fast as the next commonly used 
basis set i.e., 3–21G(*). But at the same time, STO–3G gives 
significantly less accurate geometries and energies than 
3–21G(*) basis.

S. No. Basis set Uses of Basis set
3. STO–3G* STO–3G basis supplemented with five d-function or 
polarisation functions after first row elements in periodic 
table i.e., after Neon, becomes STO–3G* basis. It gives 
comparable results to those of the 3–21G(*) basis set.
Split valence and double-zeta basis set
4. 3–21G In this basis set, we split each valence shell into two parts—
an inner shell and an outer shell. The basis function of the 
inner shell is represented by two Gaussians and that of outer 
shell by one Gaussian, hence the ‘21’. The core orbitals are 
each represented by one basis function each composed of 
three Gaussians and hence the ‘3’.
Basis set in which only the valance orbitals are splitted are 
called split valence basis set.
5. 3–21G(*
) The 3–21G basis set supplemented with appropriate 
d-function or polarization function is called 3–21G(*
)
basis set. For H to Ne; the 3–21G and 3–21G(*
)
 basis set 
are identical. For molecules with atoms beyond the first 
row (beyond Ne), the pure 3-21G basis tends to give poor 
geometries. This problem is largely overcome for second 
row elements (Na–Ar), by supplementing this basis with 
d-functions called polarizing functions. The asterisk, *, 
indicates polarization functions and the parentheses ( ) 
means the extra polarization functions which are present 
only beyond the first row i.e. after Ne. The 3–21G basis is 
not normally employed for atoms beyond Ne, here the usual 
3–21G type basis set is the 3–21G(*
)
. The 3–21G(*
)
 basis 
set remarkably gives good geometries and is used for the 
geometry optimization step of some high accuracy energy 
methods. It is roughly ten times as fast as the next widely 
used 6–31G* and is much less demanding of computer 
power.
6. 3–21G* In this basis set, set of six d-functions are added to the first 
row elements (beyond He).
7. 3–21G** In this basis set, set of three p-functions are added to H and 
He instead of d-function to heavy atoms.
8. 6–31G* or 
6–31G(d)
This is a split valence basis set with a set of six d-functions. 
The valence shell of each atom is split into an inner part 
composed of three Gaussians, and an outer part composed 
of one Guassian and hence ‘31’. While the core orbital are 
each represented by one basis function each composed of 
six Gaussians, hence the ‘6’.
It gives good geometries and reasonable relative energies 
and hence better than 3–21G(*
)
 basis set. But it is ten times 
slow than 3–21G(*
)
.

9. 6–31G** or 
6–31G(d, p)
The 6–31G* basis set adds d-function or polarization 
functions only to heavy atoms (beyond He). In 6–31G** 
basis set, the set of three p-functions are also added to H and 
He instead of adding d-functions to heavy atoms. This basis 
set is more preferable than 6–31G*, where the hydrogens 
are engaged in some special activity like hydrogen bonding 
or bridging.
10. 6–311G** or
6–311G(d, p)
It is an example of large basis set. This is a split valence 
set with each valence orbital split into three shells, 
composed of three, one and one Gaussian. While the 
core orbitals are represented by one basis function 
composed of six Gaussians. Also each heavy atom has 
five d-functions and each H and He atoms has three 
p-functions.
Diffuse functions: Core electrons or bonded electrons are tightly bound to 
the nucleus, whereas, lone-pair of electrons are relatively loosely bound to the 
nucleus. To explain the behaviour of such loosely bound expanded electrons 
in heteroatoms (like ethers and amines) in anions and in electronically excited 
molecules, the diffuse functions are used. The diffuse function is indicated 
by ‘+’ sign.

11.10 FUTURE OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY: COMPUTATIONAL 
CHEMISTRY
The very substantial progress in quantum chemistry in recent years has made 
quantum mechanical calculations a valuable tool to help decide a wide variety 
of questions of real chemical interest. While, years ago quantum mechanics was 
only treated as one of the several components of physical chemistry course. 
However, now the future of quantum mechanics is inextricably linked to future 
of chemistry by actually using quantum mechanics to address the real chemical 
problems in face of computational chemistry. Many Noble prizes have been 
awarded in chemistry to scientists who developed this branch to its advancement. 
The Noble committee has also noted that Computational Quantum Chemistry 
is “revolutionising the whole of chemistry”.

Appendix 9: HOW TO TAKE LOG AND ANTILOG
“Logarithm”
[Negative log is never seen]
Always first convert the given number, whose ‘log’ is to be seen in the standard 
form. The standard form is the number with one deciaml place and mutiplied 
by 10n
Examples:
 (1) log 2 = log ( 2.0 0 × 10°)
So we seen in the log table, the value of 20 in 0, which comes out to be 0.3010
Always the chart of log table is in decimal, which is not shown.
\ log (2.00 × 100
) = log 2.00 + 0 log 10
1
↓
=

 = 0.3010 + 0 = 0.3010
 (2) log (324) = log ( 3.2 4 × 102
)
So we see in the log table, the value of 32 in 4, which comes out to be 0.5105
\ log (3.24 × 102
 ) = log (3.24) + 2 log 10 
=1
 = 0.5105 + 2 = 2.5105
 (3) log (4243) = log ( 4.2 4 3 × 103
)
 So we see in the log table, the value of 42 in 4 and mean difference value 
in 3 and add them, which comes out to be: 0.6274
 0.0003 (mean difference)
 0.6277
\ log (4.243 × 103
) = log (4.243) + 3 log 10
 = 0.6277 + 3
 = 3.6277 
 (4) log (2.424) = log ( 2.4 2 4 × 10°)
This is already in the standard form with one decimal place
 So we see in the log table, the value of 24 in 2 and mean difference value 
in 4 and add them, which comes out to be:
 0.3838
 0.0007 (mean difference)
 0.3845
\ log (2.424 × 10°) = log (2.424 × 10°)
 = log (2.424) + 0 log 10
 = 0.3845 + 0 = 0.3845610 Appendices
 (5) log (42432) = log ( 4.2 4 3 2 × 104
)
 There are two mean difference column which are given in the chart.
 So first we see in the log table, the value of 42 in 4 and mean difference 
value in 3 using first column and mean difference value in 2 using second 
column of mean difference. Also the main answer and the mean difference 
value in first column is added and the value of mean difference in second 
column is just putted at the end of the added answer, so:
 0.6274
 0.0003
 0.6277 8 mean different in IInd column 
which is just putted at the end.
 log (4.2432 × 104
 ) = log (4.2432 × 104
)
 = log (4.2432) + 4 log 10
 = 0.62778 + 4 = 4.62778.
“Antilogarithm”
When, antilog of a number is taken the value before the decimal in the number 
goes to the power of 10 in the answer. So always from the antilog table, the 
value after the decimal is seen
Examples:
 (1) Antilog (2) = Antilog (2.0) = 102
 (2) Antilog (90) = Antilog (90.0) = 1090
 (3) Antilog 2. 42 4 3
 ↓
This ‘2’ goes to the 
power 10 in the answer 
because it is before the 
decimal.
 Now we see in the antilog table, the value of (.42) in 4 and mean difference 
value in 3 and add them, which come out to be:
 2655
 + 2 (mean diff.)
 2657
Then put a decimal after one digit in the answer = 2.657
\ Antilog (2.4243) = Antilog (0.4243) + Antilog (2)
 = 2.657 × 102Appendix 9: How to take Log and Antilog 611
Negative Antilogarithm
The (–ve) of log can never be evaluated but the advantage of antilog is that we 
can see the antilog of (–ve) numbers.
Before taking the antilog, first convert the (–ve) number into the (+ve) 
number by adding and subtracting 1 from it and then take the antilog.
Example:
 1. Antilog [– 2.4243]
 = Antilog [– 2 – 0.4243]
 = Antilog [– 2 – 0.4243 + 1 – 1]
 = Antilog [ – 2 + (– 0.4243 + 1) – 1]
 = Antilog − + − + −





2 0 ( .4243 1 1 )
    
 = Antilog [– 3 + (0.5757)]
 = Antilog ( 0.57 5 7 + Antilog (– 3)
 From Antilog table:
 3758
 + 6
 3764
 = 3.764 × 10–3
Then put a decimal after one digit in the answer = 3.764.
Therefore, Antilog [–2.4243]
