Our Proven Teaching 
and Learning System
U
sers of Principles of Managerial Finance have praised the effectiveness of 
the book’s Teaching and Learning System, which they hail as one of its hall￾marks. The system, driven by a set of carefully developed learning goals, has 
been retained and polished in this fourteenth edition. The “walkthrough” on the 
pages that follow illustrates and describes the key elements of the Teaching and 
Learning System. We encourage both students and instructors to acquaint them￾selves at the start of the semester with the many useful features the book offers.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
Accounting You need to understand the relationships between the accounting 
and finance functions within the firm, how decision makers rely on the financial 
statements you prepare, why maximizing a firm’s value is not the same as maxi￾mizing its profits, and the ethical duty you have when reporting financial results to 
investors and other stakeholders.
informAtion SYStemS You need to understand why financial information is 
important to managers in all functional areas, the documentation that firms must 
produce to comply with various regulations, and how manipulating information 
for personal gain can get managers into serious trouble.
mAnAgement You need to understand the various legal forms of a business 
organization, how to communicate the goal of the firm to employees and other 
stakeholders, the advantages and disadvantages of the agency relationship 
 between a firm’s managers and its owners, and how compensation systems can 
align or misalign the interests of managers and investors.
mArketing You need to understand why increasing a firm’s revenues or market 
share is not always a good thing, how financial managers evaluate aspects of 
customer relations such as cash and credit management policies, and why a 
firm’s brands are an important part of its value to investors.
operAtionS You need to understand the financial benefits of increasing a firm’s 
production efficiency, why maximizing profit by cutting costs may not increase 
the firm’s value, and how managers act on behalf of investors when operating a 
corporation.
In your personal life many of the principles of managerial finance 
also apply to your personal life. Learning a 
few simple financial principles can help you manage your own money more 
 effectively.

The Role of Managerial 1 Finance
Six Learning Goals at the start of the 
chapter highlight the most important con￾cepts and techniques in the chapter. Students 
are reminded to think about the learning 
goals while working through the chapter by 
strategically placed learning goal icons.
Every chapter opens with a feature, titled 
Why This Chapter Matters to You, that 
helps motivate student interest by high￾lighting both professional and personal 
benefits from achieving the chapter learning 
goals.
Its first part, In Your Professional Life, 
discusses the intersection of the finance 
topics covered in the chapter with the con￾cerns of other major business disciplines. It 
encourages students majoring in accounting, 
information systems, management, mar￾keting, and operations to appreciate how 
financial acumen will help them achieve 
their professional goals.
The second part, In Your Personal Life, 
identifies topics in the chapter that will have 
particular application to personal finance. 
This feature also helps students appreciate 
the tasks performed in a business setting by 
pointing out that the tasks are not neces￾sarily different from those that are relevant 
in their personal lives.Each chapter begins with a short opening 
vignette that describes a recent real-company 
event related to the chapter topic. These stories 
raise interest in the chapter by demonstrating 
its relevance in the business world.
Learning goal icons tie chapter con￾tent to the learning goals and appear 
next to related text sections and again in 
the chapter-end summary, end-of-chapter 
homework materials, and supplements 
such as the Study Guide, Test Item File,
and MyFinanceLab.
For help in study and review, boldfaced 
key terms and their definitions appear 
in the margin where they are first intro￾duced. These terms are also boldfaced in 
the book’s index and appear in the end￾of-book glossary.

and depth to the material covered in the 
chapter.
Going Green to Find Value
O
ne of the most “hotly” debated topics of our day 
has been the issue of global warming and the 
benefits and costs of lower emissions. Many companies 
are investing in radical new technologies with the hope 
of capitalizing on the going green movement. On June 
29, 2010, Tesla Motors raised $226 million in its 
initial public offering (IPO) of common stock. Tesla, 
whose shares trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange, 
was the first automaker to use lithium ion batteries to 
produce an all-electric vehicle with a range of more 
than 200 miles. Even though Tesla racked up losses of 
$279 million from 2006 to 2009 and had never been 
profitable, investors were enthusiastic about the IPO, 
and Tesla’s stock price rose from $17 to $24 on its first 
day of trading.
Excitement about Tesla’s prospects was fueled in 
part by its mission to reduce carbon emissions and in 
part by its charismatic cofounder, Elon Musk, who had 
previously started several successful companies, including 
PayPal. It also helped that the federal government offered 
a tax subsidy of $7,500 to anyone who purchased an electric vehicle, and some states offered 
additional tax incentives. In its first 2 years as a public company, Tesla continued to struggle to 
become profitable, but its stock price gradually trended upward. In 2013, Tesla reported its first 
quarterly profit as well as its first quarter of positive cash flow. Just days after that news hit the 
markets, Consumer Reports announced that Tesla’s sedan, the Model S, was the best car it had ever 
tested, receiving the highest score in the magazine’s history, a 99 out of 100. From May 8 to May 
13, the company’s stock rose 57 percent! In the long run, Tesla’s stock price will depend on its 
ability to generate positive cash flows, without the help of government subsidies, and convince the 
market of its ability to do so into the future.

6.2 Corporate Bonds
A corporate bond is a long-term debt instrument indicating that a corporation 
has borrowed a certain amount of money and promises to repay it in the future 
under clearly defined terms. Most bonds are issued with maturities of 10 to 
30 years and with a par value, or face value, of $1,000. The coupon interest rate
on a bond represents the percentage of the bond’s par value that will be paid an￾nually, typically in two equal semiannual payments, as interest. The bondholders, 
who are the lenders, are promised the semiannual interest payments and, at ma￾turity, repayment of the principal amount.

Corporations
A corporation is an entity created by law. A corporation has the legal powers of 
an individual in that it can sue and be sued, make and be party to contracts, and 
acquire property in its own name. Although only about 20 percent of all U.S. 
businesses are incorporated, the largest businesses nearly always are; corpora￾tions account for roughly 80 percent of total business revenues. Although corpo￾rations engage in all types of businesses, manufacturing firms account for the 
largest portion of corporate business receipts and net profits. Table 1.1 lists the 
key strengths and weaknesses of corporations.

Bond Yields Hit Record Lows
O
n July 25, 2012, the 10-year Treasury note and 30-year Treasury bond yields reached 
all-time lows of 1.43% and 2.46%. That was good news for the housing market. Many 
mortgage rates are linked to rates on Treasury securities. For example, the traditional 30-year 
mortgage rate is typically linked to the yield on 10-year Treasury notes. With mortgage rates 
reaching new lows, potential buyers found that they could afford more expensive homes, and 
existing homeowners were able to refinance their existing loans, lowering their monthly mort￾gage payments and leaving them with more money to spend on other things. This kind of activ￾ity is precisely what the Federal Reserve hoped to stimulate by keeping interest rates low during 
the economic recovery.Examples are an important component 
of the book’s learning system. Numbered 
and clearly set off from the text, they 
provide an immediate and concrete dem￾onstration of how to apply financial con￾cepts, tools, and techniques.
Some examples demonstrate time-value￾of-money techniques. These examples 
often show the use of time lines, equa￾tions, financial calculators, and spread￾sheets (with cell formulas).

with some examples, indicates that the

In Example 5.8 of Braden Company, we found the present value of Braden’s 
$700, 5-year ordinary annuity discounted at 8% to be $2,794.90. If we now as￾sume that Braden’s $700 annual cash flow occurs at the start of each year and is 
thereby an annuity due. This situation is depicted on the following time line.

Calculator use Before using your calculator to find the present value of an annuity 
due, you must either switch it to BEGIN mode or use the DUE key, depending on the 
specifics of your calculator. Then, using the inputs shown at the left, you will find the 
present value of the annuity due to be $3,018.49 (Note: Because we nearly always 
assume end-of-period cash flows, be sure to switch your calculator back to END 
mode when you have completed your annuity-due calculations.)

finance concepts, tools, and techniques to 
their personal financial decisions.
Fran Abrams wishes to determine how much money she will 
have at the end of 5 years if she chooses annuity A, the ordinary 
annuity. She will deposit $1,000 annually, at the end of each of the next 
5 years, into a savings account paying 7% annual interest. This situation is 
depicted on the following time line.

For many years, inves￾tors around the world 
clamored to invest with Bernard 
Madoff. Those fortunate enough to 
invest with “Bernie” might not have 
understood his secret trading system, 
but they were happy with the double￾digit returns that they earned. Madoff 
was well connected, having been the 
chairman of the board of directors of 
the NASDAQ Stock Market and a 
founding member of the International 
Securities Clearing Corporation. His 
credentials seemed to be impeccable.
However, as the old saying goes, if 
something sounds too good to be true, it 
probably is. Madoff’s investors learned 
this lesson the hard way when, on 
December 11, 2008, the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
charged Madoff with securities fraud. 
Madoff’s hedge fund, Ascot Partners, 
turned out to be a giant Ponzi scheme.
Over the years, suspicions were 
raised about Madoff. He generated high 
returns year after year, seemingly with 
very little risk. Madoff credited his com￾plex trading strategy for his investment 
performance, but other investors 
employed similar strategies with much 
different results than Madoff reported. 
Harry Markopolos went as far as to sub￾mit a report to the SEC 3 years prior to 
Madoff’s arrest, titled “The World’s Larg￾est Hedge Fund Is a Fraud,” that 
detailed his concerns.
On June 29, 2009, after a lengthy 
trial and eventual conviction, Madoff 
was sentenced to 150 years in prison. 
Madoff’s investors are still working to 
recover what they can. Fraudulent 
account statements sent just prior to 
Madoff’s arrest indicated that investors’ 
accounts contained more than $64 bil￾lion, in aggregate. Many investors pur￾sued claims based on the balance 
reported in these statements. However, a 
court ruling only permits claims up to the 
difference between the amount an inves￾tor deposited with Madoff and the 
amount the investor withdrew. The judge 
also ruled that investors who managed to 
withdraw at least their initial investment 
before the fraud was uncovered are not 
eligible to recover additional funds.
Total out-of-pocket cash losses 
as a result of Madoff’s fraud were 
estimated to be $17.5 billion. In early 
2013, the Securities Investor Protec￾tion Corporation reported that more 
than 53 percent of the funds had 
either been returned or were in the 
process of being returned to Madoff’s 
defrauded customers.

In tough economic 
times, the standard for 
a payback period is often reduced. 
Chief information officers (CIOs) are apt 
to reject projects with payback periods 
of more than 2 years. “We start with 
payback period,” says Ron Fijalkowski, 
CIO at Strategic Distribution, Inc., in 
Bensalem, Pennsylvania. “For sure, if 
the payback period is over 36 months, 
it’s not going to get approved. But our 
rule of thumb is we’d like to see 24 
months. And if it’s close to 12, it’s prob￾ably a no-brainer.”
Although easy to compute and easy 
to understand, the payback period’s 
simplicity brings with it some draw￾backs. “Payback gives you an answer 
that tells you a bit about the beginning 
stage of a project, but it doesn’t tell you 
much about the full lifetime of the proj￾ect,” says Chris Gardner, a cofounder 
of iValue LLC, an IT valuation

metric for evaluating IT projects—even 
more important than discounted cash 
flow (NPV and IRR)—because it spot￾lights the risks inherent in lengthy IT proj￾ects. “It should be a hard-and-fast rule to 
never take an IT project with a payback 
period greater than 3 years, unless it’s 
an infrastructure project you can’t do 
without,” Campbell says.
Whatever the weaknesses of the pay￾back period method of evaluating capital 
projects, the simplicity of the method does 
allow it to be used in conjunction with 
other, more sophisticated measures. It 
can be used to screen potential projects 
and winnow them down to the few that 
merit more careful scrutiny with, for exam￾ple, net present value (NPV).

the NPV method, should it be used

consultancy in Barrington, Illinois. “The 
simplicity of computing payback may 
encourage sloppiness, especially the 
failure to include all costs associated 
with an investment, such as training, 
maintenance, and hardware upgrade 
costs,” says Douglas Emond, senior vice 
president and chief technology officer 
at Eastern Bank in Lynn, Massachusetts. 
For example, he says, “you may be 
bringing in a hot new technology, but 
uh-oh, after implementation you realize 
that you need a .Net guru in-house, 
and you don’t have one.”
But the payback method’s emphasis 
on the short term has a special appeal 
for IT managers. “That’s because the 
history of IT projects that take longer 
than 3 years is disastrous,” says Gard￾ner. Indeed, Ian Campbell, chief re￾search officer at Nucleus Research, Inc., 
in Wellesley, Massachusetts, says pay￾back period is an absolutely essential

Earlier in this chapter 
(see Table 8.5 on 
page 324), we learned that from 
1900 through 2011, the U.S. stock 
market produced an average annual 
nominal return of 9.3 percent, but that 
return was associated with a relatively 
high standard deviation: 20.2 percent 
per year. Could U.S. investors have 
done better by diversifying globally? 
The answer is a qualified yes. Elroy 
Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike 
Staunton calculated the historical 
returns on a portfolio that included U.S. 
stocks as well as stocks from 18 other 
countries. This diversified portfolio pro￾duced returns that were not quite as 
high as the U.S. average, just 8.5 per￾cent per year. However, the globally 
diversified portfolio was also less vola￾tile, with an annual standard deviation 
of 17.7 percent. Dividing the standard 
deviation by the annual return pro￾duces a coefficient of variation for the 
globally diversified portfolio of 2.08, 
slightly lower than the 2.17 coefficient 
of variation reported for U.S. stocks in 
Table 8.5.

include any domestic assets, 
whereas global mutual funds include

The end-of-chapter Summary
consists of two sections. The first 
section, Focus on Value, explains 
how the chapter’s content relates to 
the firm’s goal of maximizing owner 
wealth. This feature helps reinforce 
understanding of the link between 
the financial manager’s actions and 
share value.
The second part of the Summary, 
the Review of Learning Goals, 
restates each learning goal and 
summarizes the key material that 
was presented to support mastery 
of the goal. This review provides 
students with an opportunity to rec￾oncile what they have learned with 
the learning goal and to confirm 
their understanding before moving 
forward.
Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
Time value of money is an important tool that financial managers and other mar￾ket participants use to assess the effects of proposed actions. Because firms have 
long lives and some decisions affect their long-term cash flows, the effective appli￾cation of time-value-of-money techniques is extremely important. These tech￾niques enable financial managers to evaluate cash flows occurring at different 
times so as to combine, compare, and evaluate them and link them to the firm’s 
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
LG 1 Discuss the role of time value in finance, the use of computational tools, 
and the basic patterns of cash flow. Financial managers and investors use time￾value-of-money techniques when assessing the value of expected cash flow 
streams. Alternatives can be assessed by either compounding to find future 
value or discounting to find present value. Financial managers rely primarily 
on present value techniques. Financial calculators, electronic spreadsheets, and 
financial tables can streamline the application of time value techniques. The 
cash flow of a firm can be described by its pattern: single amount, annuity, or 
mixed stream.
Opener-in-Review
Tesla Motors shares were initially offered to investors at $17. Three years later, 
the price was $90 per share. What was the compound annual return that Tesla 
investors owned over this period? Given that Tesla paid no dividends and was 
not expected to start paying dividends anytime soon, what method might ana￾lysts have used to value the company’s shares in 2013? The company sold 13.3 
million shares in its IPO with a par value of $0.001 per share. How much paid￾in capital did Tesla record on its balance sheet as a result of the IPO? Do you 
think that the highly favorable Consumer Reports review of the Model S 
boosted Tesla’s stock primarily because the review reduced the company’s risk 
or because it boosted expected cash flows?
Self-Test Problems  (Solutions in Appendix)
 ST3–1 Ratio formulas and interpretations  Without referring to the text, indicate for each 
of the following ratios the formula for calculating it and the kinds of problems, if 
any, the firm may have if that ratio is too high relative to the industry average. What 
if the ratio is too low relative to the industry average? Create a table similar to the 
one that follows and fill in the empty blocks.

Warm-up Exercises follow the Self￾Test Problems. These short, numerical 
exercises give students practice in 
applying tools and techniques presented 
in the chapter.
Warm-up Exercises  All problems are available in MyFinancelab.
E4–1 The installed cost of a new computerized controller was $65,000. Calculate the de￾preciation schedule by year assuming a recovery period of 5 years and using the ap￾propriate MACRS depreciation percentages given in Table 4.2 on page 120.
E4–2 Classify the following changes in each of the accounts as either an inflow or an out￾flow of cash. During the year (a) marketable securities increased, (b) land and build￾ings decreased, (c) accounts payable increased, (d) vehicles decreased, (e) accounts 
receivable increased, and (f) dividends were paid.

Comprehensive Problems, keyed to 
the learning goals, are longer and more 
complex than the Warm-Up Exercises. 
In this section, instructors will find mul￾tiple problems that address the impor￾tant concepts, tools, and techniques in 
the chapter.
A short descriptor identifies the 
essential concept or technique of 
the problem. Problems labeled as 
Integrative tie together related topics.
Every chapter includes a Spreadsheet 
Exercise. This exercise gives students an oppor￾tunity to use Excel software to create one or 
more spreadsheets with which to analyze a 
financial problem. The spreadsheet to be created 
is often modeled on a table or Excel screen￾shot located in the chapter. Students can access 
working versions of the Excel screenshots in 
MyFinanceLab.
An Integrative Case at the end of each part 
of the book challenges students to use what they 
have learned over the course of several chapters. 
Additional chapter resources, such as Chapter 
Cases, Group Exercises, and numerous online 
resources, intended to provide further means for 
student learning and assessment are available in 
MyFinanceLab at www.myfinancelab.com.
Personal Finance Problems specifi￾cally relate to personal finance situations 
and Personal Finance Examples in each 
chapter. These problems will help students 
see how they can apply the tools and 
techniques of managerial finance in man￾aging their own finances.
The last item in the chapter Problems is 
an Ethics Problem. The ethics problem 
gives students another opportunity to 
think about and apply ethics principles to 
managerial financial situations.

 P4–1 Depreciation On March 20, 2015, Norton Systems acquired two new assets. Asset 
A was research equipment costing $17,000 and having a 3-year recovery period. 
Asset B was duplicating equipment having an installed cost of $45,000 and a 5-year 
recovery period. Using the MACRS depreciation percentages in Table 4.2 on page 
120, prepare a depreciation schedule for each of these assets.
 P4–2 Depreciation In early 2015, Sosa Enterprises purchased a new machine for $10,000 
to make cork stoppers for wine bottles. The machine has a 3-year recovery period 
and is expected to have a salvage value of $2,000. Develop a depreciation schedule 
for this asset using the MACRS depreciation percentages in Table 4.2.

P4–10 Preparation of cash budget Sam and Suzy Sizeman need to prepare a cash budget 
for the last quarter of 2016 to make sure they can cover their expenditures during 
the period. Sam and Suzy have been preparing budgets for the past several years and 
have been able to establish specific percentages for most of their cash outflows. 
These percentages are based on their take-home pay (that is, monthly utilities nor￾mally run 5% of monthly take-home pay). The information in the following table 
can be used to create their fourth-quarter budget for 2016.

 P4–21 ETHICS PROBLEM The SEC is trying to get companies to notify the investment 
community more quickly when a “material change” will affect their forthcoming 
financial results. In what sense might a financial manager be seen as “more ethical” 
if he or she follows this directive and issues a press release indicating that sales will 
not be as high as previously anticipated?

CSM Corporation has a bond issue outstanding at the end of 2015. The bond has 
15 years remaining to maturity and carries a coupon interest rate of 6%. Interest on 
the bond is compounded on a semiannual basis. The par value of the CSM bond is 
$1,000, and it is currently selling for $874.42.
Encore International
I
n the world of trendsetting fashion, instinct and marketing savvy are prerequisites 
to success. Jordan Ellis had both. During 2015, his international casual-wear 
company, Encore, rocketed to $300 million in sales after 10 years in business. His 
fashion line covered the young woman from head to toe with hats, sweaters, 
dresses, blouses, skirts, pants, sweatshirts, socks, and shoes. In Manhattan, there 
was an Encore shop every five or six blocks, each featuring a different color. Some 
shops showed the entire line in mauve, and others featured it in canary yellow.
Encore had made it. The company’s historical growth was so spectacular 
that no one could have predicted it. However, securities analysts speculated that 
Encore could not keep up the pace. They warned that competition is fierce in the 
fashion industry and that the firm might encounter little or no growth in the 
future. They estimated that stockholders also should expect no growth in future 
dividends.
Contrary to the conservative securities analysts, Jordan Ellis believed that the

T
he desire to write Principles of Managerial Finance came from the experi￾ence of teaching the introductory managerial finance course. Those who have 
taught the introductory course many times can appreciate the difficulties that 
some students have absorbing and applying financial concepts. Students want a 
book that speaks to them in plain English and a book that ties concepts to reality. 
These students want more than just description; they also want demonstration of 
concepts, tools, and techniques. This book is written with the needs of students in 
mind, and it effectively delivers the resources that students need to succeed in the 
introductory finance course.
Courses and students have changed since the first edition of this book, but 
the goals of the text have not changed. The conversational tone and wide use of 
examples set off in the text still characterize Principles of Managerial Finance. 
Building on those strengths, 14 editions, numerous translations, and well over 
half a million U.S. users, Principles has evolved based on feedback from both 
instructors and students, from adopters, nonadopters, and practitioners. In this 
edition, Larry and I have worked to ensure that the book reflects contemporary 
thinking and pedagogy to further strengthen the delivery of the classic topics that 
our users have come to expect.
ChANGES TO ThE FOuRTEENTh EdITION
As we made plans to publish the fourteenth edition, we carefully assessed feedback 
from users of the thirteenth edition as well as instructors not currently using our 
text about content changes that would improve this teaching and learning tool.
In every chapter, our changes were designed to make the material more up to 
date and more relevant for students. A number of new topics have been added at 
appropriate places, and new features appear in each chapter: 
	 •	 The	Matter	of	Fact	feature	provides	additional	detail	and	interesting	empirical	
facts that help students understand the practical implications of financial concepts. 
Many of these features have been updated or replaced in the fourteenth edition. 
	 •	 All	 the	chapter-opening	vignettes	 (and	some	of	 the	 In	Practice	boxes)	have	
been replaced or heavily revised. Many of the chapter openers feature com￾panies such as Facebook, Tesla, Diamond Comic Distributors, Lowe’s, 
Whirlpool, Nokia, and Dell that are familiar to students. We designed these 
opening vignettes to impress upon students that the material they will see in 
each chapter is relevant for business in the “real world.” 
	 •	 MyFinanceLab	now	contains	several	additional	resources	to	demonstrate	the	
examples. The new MyFinanceLab Financial Calculator allows students to 
find the solution for an example by inputting the keystrokes shown in the cal￾culator screenshot. The new MyFinanceLab Solution Video allows the student 
to watch a video of the author discussing or solving the example. There are 
also MyFinanceLab Videos on related core topical areas.
37	 •	 We	close	each	chapter	with	an	Opener	in	Review	question	that	asks	students	
to go back to the chapter opener and answer a question based on what they’ve 
learned by working through the chapter.
	 •	 We	also	made	changes	to	many	of	the	problems	at	the	end	of	each	chapter.
The chapter sequence is essentially unchanged from the prior edition, but 
there are some noteworthy changes within each chapter. This edition contains 
19 chapters divided into eight parts. Each part is introduced by a brief overview, 
which is intended to give students an advance sense for the collective value of the 
chapters included in the part.
Part 1 contains two chapters. The first provides an overview of the role of man￾agerial finance in a business enterprise. The second describes the financial market 
context in which firms operate and provides expanded and updated coverage of the 
recent financial crisis and its lingering consequences. This chapter not only explores 
the root causes and effects of the financial crisis, but it also discusses the changing 
regulatory landscape within which financial institutions and markets function.
Part 2 contains three chapters focused on basic financial skills such as finan￾cial statement analysis, cash flow analysis, and time-value-of-money calculations.
Part 3 focuses on bond and stock valuation. We placed these two chapters 
just ahead of the risk and return chapter to provide students with exposure to 
basic material on bonds and stocks that is easier to grasp than some of the more 
theoretical concepts in the next part.
Part 4 contains the risk and return chapter as well as the chapter on the cost 
of capital. We believe that following the risk and return chapter with the cost of 
capital material helps students understand the important principle that the expec￾tations of a firm’s investors shape how the firm should approach major invest￾ment decisions (which are covered in Part 5). In other words, Part 4 is designed to 
help students understand where a project “hurdle rate” comes from before they 
start using hurdle rates in capital budgeting problems.
Part 5 contains three chapters on various capital budgeting topics. The first 
of these chapters focuses on capital budgeting methods such as payback and net 
present value analysis. The second chapter in this part explains how financial 
analysts construct cash flow projections, which are a required component of net 
present value analysis. The final chapter in this section describes how firms ana￾lyze the risks associated with capital investments.
Parts 6 deals with the topics of capital structure and payout policy. These two 
chapters contain updated material on trends in firms’ use of leverage and their 
payout practices.
Part 7 contains two chapters centered on working capital issues. A major 
development in business has been the extent to which firms have found new ways 
to economize on working capital investments. The first chapter in Part 7 explains 
why and how firms work hard to squeeze resources from their investments in 
current assets such as cash and inventory. The second chapter in this part focuses 
more on management of current liabilities.
Finally, Part 8 has three chapters covering a variety of topics, including hybrid 
securities, mergers and other forms of restructurings, and international finance. 
These subjects are some of the most dynamic areas in financial practice, and we 
have made a number of changes here to reflect current practices.
Although the text content is sequential, instructors can assign almost any 
chapter as a self-contained unit, enabling instructors to customize the text to 
various teaching strategies and course lengths.
38 PrefaceLike the previous editions, the fourteenth edition incorporates a proven 
learning system, which integrates pedagogy with concepts and practical applica￾tions. It concentrates on the knowledge that is needed to make keen financial 
decisions in an increasingly competitive business environment. The strong peda￾gogy and generous use of examples—including personal finance examples—make 
the text an easily accessible resource for in-class learning or out-of-class learning, 
such as online courses and self-study programs.
ORGANIZATION
The text’s organization conceptually links the firm’s actions and its value as deter￾mined in the financial market. Each major decision area is presented in terms of 
both risk and return factors and their potential impact on owners’ wealth. A 
Focus on Value element in each chapter’s Summary helps reinforce the student’s 
understanding of the link between the financial manager’s actions and the firm’s 
share value.
In organizing each chapter, we have adhered to a managerial decision-making 
perspective, relating decisions to the firm’s overall goal of wealth maximization. 
Once	a	particular	concept	has	been	developed,	its	application	is	illustrated	by	an	
example, which is a hallmark feature of this book. These examples demonstrate, 
and solidify in the student’s thought, financial decision-making considerations 
and their consequences.
INTERNATIONAL CONSIdERATIONS
We live in a world where international considerations cannot be divorced 
from the study of business in general and finance in particular. As in prior edi￾tions, discussions of international dimensions of chapter topics are integrated 
throughout the book. International material is integrated into learning goals 
and end-of-chapter materials. In addition, for those who want to spend more 
time addressing the topic, a separate chapter on international managerial finance 
concludes the book.
PERSONAL FINANCE LINKAGES
The fourteenth edition contains several features designed to help students see the 
value of applying financial principles and techniques in their personal lives. At the 
start of each chapter, the Why This Chapter Matters to You feature helps motivate 
student interest by discussing how the topic of the chapter relates to the concerns 
of other major business disciplines and to personal finance. Within the chapter, 
Personal Finance Examples explicitly link the concepts, tools, and techniques of 
each chapter to personal finance applications. Throughout the homework mate￾rial, the book provides numerous personal finance problems. The purpose of 
these personal finance materials is to demonstrate to students the usefulness of 
managerial finance knowledge in both business and personal financial dealings.
EThICAL ISSuES
The need for ethics in business remains as important as ever. Students need to 
understand the ethical issues that financial managers face as they attempt to 
maximize shareholder value and to solve business problems. Thus, every chapter 
includes an In Practice box that focuses on current ethical issues.
 Preface 39hOMEWORK OPPORTuNITIES
Of course, practice is essential for students’ learning of managerial finance 
concepts, tools, and techniques. To meet that need, the book offers a rich and 
varied menu of homework assignments: short, numerical Warm-Up Exercises; a 
comprehensive set of Problems, including more than one problem for each impor￾tant concept or technique and personal finance problems; an Ethics Problem for 
each chapter; a Spreadsheet Exercise; and, at the end of each part of the book, 
an Integrative Case. In addition, the end-of-section Excel Review Questions and 
the end-of-chapter problems are available in algorithmic form in MyFinanceLab. 
These materials (see pages x through xii for detailed descriptions) offer students 
solid learning opportunities, and they offer instructors opportunities to expand 
and enrich the classroom environment.
From classroom to boardroom, the fourteenth edition of Principles of 
Managerial Finance can help users get to where they want to be. We believe that it 
is the best edition yet: more relevant, more accurate, and more effective than ever.

40 PrefaceSupplements to the Fourteenth Edition
The Principles of Managerial Finance Teaching and Learning System includes a 
variety of useful supplements for teachers and for students.
TEAChING TOOLS FOR INSTRuCTORS
The key teaching tools available to instructors are the Instructor’s Manual, testing 
materials, and PowerPoint Lecture Presentations.
Instructor’s Manual This comprehensive resource pulls together the teaching 
tools so that instructors can use the textbook easily and effectively in the class￾room. Each chapter provides an overview of key topics and detailed answers 
and	 solutions	 to	 all	 review	questions,	Opener-in-Review	questions,	Warm-Up	
Exercises, end-of-chapter problems, and chapter cases, plus suggested answers 
to all critical thinking questions in chapter boxes, Ethics Problems, and Group 
Exercises. At the end of the manual are practice quizzes and solutions. The com￾plete Instructor’s Manual, including Spreadsheet Exercises, is available online at 
the Instructor’s Resource Center (www.pearsonglobaleditions.com/gitman).
Test Item File Thoroughly revised to accommodate changes in the text, the Test 
Item File consists of a mix of true/false, multiple-choice, and essay questions. 
Each test question includes identifiers for type of question, skill tested by learning 
goal, and key topic tested plus, where appropriate, the formulas or equations 
used in deriving the answer.
The Test Item File is also available in Test Generator Software (TestGen)
for either Windows or Macintosh. The Test Item File and TestGen are available 
online at the Instructor’s Resource Center (www.pearsonglobaleditions.com/gitman).
PowerPoint Lecture Presentation Revised by Kate Demarest, Carroll 
Community College. This presentation combines lecture notes with all the art 
from the textbook. The PowerPoint Lecture Presentation is available online at the 
Instructor’s Resource Center (www.pearsonglobaleditions.com/gitman).
LEARNING TOOLS FOR STudENTS
Beyond the book itself, students have access to valuable resources, such as 
MyFinanceLab and the Study Guide, that if taken advantage of can help ensure 
their success.
MyFinanceLab MyFinanceLab opens the door to a powerful Web-based diag￾nostic testing and tutorial system designed specifically for the Gitman/Zutter, 
Principles of Managerial Finance. With MyFinanceLab, instructors can create, 
edit, and assign online homework and test and track all student work in the online 
gradebook. MyFinanceLab allows students to take practice tests correlated to the 
textbook and receive a customized study plan based on the test results. Most 
41
MyFinancelabend-of-chapter problems are available in MyFinanceLab, and because the prob￾lems have algorithmically generated values, no student will have the same home￾work as another; there is an unlimited opportunity for practice and testing. 
Students get the help they need, when they need it, from the robust tutorial 
options, including “View an Example” and “Help Me Solve This,” which breaks 
the problem into its steps and links to the relevant textbook page.
This fully integrated online homework system gives students the hands-on 
practice and tutorial help they need to learn finance efficiently. There are ample 
opportunities for online practice and assessment that is automatically graded in 
MyFinanceLab (www.myfinancelab.com).
Advanced reporting features in MyFinanceLab also allow you to easily report 
on AACSB accreditation and assessment in just a few clicks.
Chapter Cases with automatically graded assessment are also provided in 
MyFinanceLab. These cases have students apply the concepts they have learned

Study Guide Revised by Shannon Donovan, Bridgewater State University. The 
Study Guide is an integral component of the Principles of Managerial Finance
Teaching and Learning System. It offers many tools for studying finance. Each 
chapter contains the following features: chapter summary enumerated by learning 
goals; topical chapter outline, also broken down by learning goals for quick 
review; sample problem solutions; study tips; and a full sample exam with the 
answers at the end of the chapter. A financial dictionary of key terms is located at 
the end of the Study Guide, along with an appendix with tips on using financial 
calculators.
NEW! Interest Rate Factor (IRF) Supplement This self-contained supplement 
explains to the student how to use the interest rate factors and works seamlessly 
with the textbook, so the student can go directly to the IRF Supplement and see 
the in-chapter example solved using the interest rate factors. All examples which 
appear in the IRF Supplement are indicated in the text with an IRF icon.

Introduction to 
Managerial Finance
P
art 1 of Principles of Managerial Finance discusses the role that financial 
managers play in businesses and the financial market environment in which 
firms operate. We argue that the goal of managers should be to maximize the 
value of the firm and by doing so maximize the wealth of its owners. Financial 
managers act on behalf of the firm’s owners by making operating and investment 
decisions whose benefits exceed their costs. These decisions create wealth for 
shareholders. Maximizing shareholder wealth is important because firms operate 
in a highly competitive financial market environment that offers shareholders many 
alternatives for investing their funds. To raise the financial resources necessary to 
fund the firm’s ongoing operations and future investment opportunities, managers 
have to deliver value to the firm’s investors. Without smart financial managers and 
access to financial markets, firms are unlikely to survive, let alone achieve the 
long-term goal of maximizing the value of the firm.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
Accounting You need to understand the relationships between the accounting 
and finance functions within the firm, how decision makers rely on the financial 
statements you prepare, why maximizing a firm’s value is not the same as maxi￾mizing its profits, and the ethical duty you have when reporting financial results to 
investors and other stakeholders.
informAtion SYStemS You need to understand why financial information is 
important to managers in all functional areas, the documentation that firms must 
produce to comply with various regulations, and how manipulating information 
for personal gain can get managers into serious trouble.
mAnAgement You need to understand the various legal forms of a business 
organization, how to communicate the goal of the firm to employees and other 
stakeholders, the advantages and disadvantages of the agency relationship 
 between a firm’s managers and its owners, and how compensation systems can 
align or misalign the interests of managers and investors.
mArketing You need to understand why increasing a firm’s revenues or market 
share is not always a good thing, how financial managers evaluate aspects of 
customer relations such as cash and credit management policies, and why a 
firm’s brands are an important part of its value to investors.
operAtionS You need to understand the financial benefits of increasing a firm’s 
production efficiency, why maximizing profit by cutting costs may not increase 
the firm’s value, and how managers act on behalf of investors when operating a 
corporation.
In your personal life many of the principles of managerial finance 
also apply to your personal life. Learning a 
few simple financial principles can help you manage your own money more 
 effectively.

Not Much to “Like” about IPO
F
or its first 8 years, Facebook, Inc., operated as a 
privately held corporation. The company had rela￾tively few shareholders and had no obligation to report its financial results to the public or to 
 regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which allowed co-founder 
Mark Zuckerberg to focus his energy on building Facebook’s rapidly growing business. Just 
6 years after its inception in Zuckerberg’s Harvard dorm room, Facebook’s user base surpassed 
the 500 million mark, and pressure mounted on Zuckerberg to “take the company public” via an 
intial public offering (IPO) of common stock. Such a move would allow Facebook’s early inves￾tors to cash out and would make dozens of Facebook’s employees rich, none more so than 
Zuckerberg himself.
On May 18, 2012, Facebook launched its IPO by selling 421 million shares at a price 
of $38 per share. Almost immediately the price of Facebook stock rose as high as $45 per 
share, but there were signs of trouble. Technical problems on the Nasdaq stock exchange 
caused millions of orders for Facebook shares to be wrongly placed. Even worse, during the 
first month after Facebook’s IPO, its share price fell to $30. Investors filed dozens of lawsuits, 
 alleging that they were harmed not only by Nasdaq’s trading glitches, but also by the selective 
release of unfavorable financial information by Facebook’s investment bankers and its senior 
managers.
Once firms “go public” by selling shares to the public, they face a host of new pressures 
that private companies do not, so why do they go public at all? Often it is to provide an exit 
strategy for private investors, gain access to investment capital, establish a market price for the 
firm’s shares, gain public exposure, or all those reasons. Going public helps firms grow, but that 
and other benefits of public ownership must be weighed against the costs of doing so. A public 
firm’s managers work for and are responsible to the firm’s investors, and government regulations 
require firms to provide investors with frequent reports disclosing material information about the 
firm’s performance. The regulatory demands placed on managers of public firms can sometimes 
distract managers from important aspects of running their businesses. This chapter will highlight 
the trade-offs faced by financial managers as they make decisions intended to maximize the 
value of their firms.

 1.1 Finance and Business
The field of finance is broad and dynamic. Finance influences everything that 
firms do, from hiring personnel to building factories to launching new advertising 
campaigns. Because there are important financial dimensions to almost any as￾pect of business, there are many financially oriented career opportunities for 
those who understand the principles of finance described in this textbook. Even if 
you do not see yourself pursuing a career in finance, you’ll find that an under￾standing of a few key ideas in finance will help make you a smarter consumer and 
a wiser investor with your own money.
WhAT IS FINANCE?
Finance can be defined as the science and art of managing money. At the personal 
level, finance is concerned with individuals’ decisions about how much of their 
earnings they spend, how much they save, and how they invest their savings. In a 
business context, finance involves the same types of decisions: how firms raise 
money from investors, how firms invest money in an attempt to earn a profit, and 
how they decide whether to reinvest profits in the business or distribute them back 
to investors. The keys to good financial decisions are much the same for businesses 
and individuals, which is why most students will benefit from an understanding of 
finance regardless of the career path they plan to follow. Learning the techniques 
of good financial analysis will not only help you make better financial decisions as 
a consumer, but it will also help you understand the financial consequences of the 
important business decisions you will face no matter what career path you follow.
CAREER OPPORTuNITIES IN FINANCE
Careers in finance typically fall into one of two broad categories: (1) financial 
services and (2) managerial finance. Workers in both areas rely on a common 
analytical “tool kit,” but the types of problems to which that tool kit is applied 
vary a great deal from one career path to the other.
Financial Services
Financial services is the area of finance concerned with the design and delivery of 
advice and financial products to individuals, businesses, and governments. It in￾volves a variety of interesting career opportunities within the areas of banking, 
personal financial planning, investments, real estate, and insurance.
Managerial Finance
Managerial finance is concerned with the duties of the financial manager working 
in a business. Financial managers administer the financial affairs of all types of 
businesses: private and public, large and small, profit seeking and not for profit. 
They perform such varied tasks as developing a financial plan or budget, extend￾ing credit to customers, evaluating proposed large expenditures, and raising money 
to fund the firm’s operations. In recent years, a number of factors have increased 
the importance and complexity of the financial manager’s duties. These factors 
include the recent global financial crisis and subsequent responses by regulators, 
increased competition, and technological change. For example, globalization has

led U.S. corporations to increase their transactions in other countries, and foreign 
corporations have done likewise in the United States. These changes increase de￾mand for financial experts who can manage cash flows in different currencies and 
protect against the risks that arise from international transactions. These changes 
increase the finance function’s complexity, but they also create opportunities for a 
more rewarding career. The increasing complexity of the financial manager’s du￾ties has increased the popularity of a variety of professional certification programs 
outlined in the Focus on Practice box below. Financial managers today actively 
develop and implement corporate strategies aimed at helping the firm grow and 
improve its competitive position. As a result, many corporate presidents and chief 
executive officers (CEOs) rose to the top of their organizations by first demon￾strating excellence in the finance function.
LEGAL FORMS OF BuSINESS ORGANIZATION
One of the most important decisions all businesses confront is how to choose a 
legal form of organization. This decision has very important financial implica￾tions because how a business is organized legally influences the risks that the 
To be successful in fi￾nance and just about

your education beyond your undergrad￾uate degree. For some people, it means 
getting a masters in business administra￾tion (MBA), but there are many other 
ways to advance your education and 
enhance your credentials without getting 
a graduate degree. In finance, a variety 
of professional certification programs 
are widely recognized in the field.

firm’s owners must bear, how the firm can raise money, and how the firm’s prof￾its will be taxed. The three most common legal forms of business organization are 
the sole proprietorship, the partnership, and the corporation. More businesses 
are organized as sole proprietorships than any other legal form, but the largest 
businesses are almost always organized as corporations. Even so, each type of 
organization has its advantages and disadvantages.
Sole Proprietorships
A sole proprietorship is a business owned by one person who operates it for his 
or her own profit. About 61 percent of all businesses are sole proprietorships. 
The typical sole proprietorship is small, such as a bike shop, personal trainer, or 
plumber. The majority of sole proprietorships operate in the wholesale, retail, 
service, and construction industries.
Typically, the owner (proprietor), along with a few employees, operates the 
proprietorship. The proprietor raises capital from personal resources or by bor￾rowing, and he or she is responsible for all business decisions. As a result, this 
form of organization appeals to entrepreneurs who enjoy working independently.
A major drawback to the sole proprietorship is unlimited liability, which 
means that liabilities of the business are the entrepreneur’s responsibility and that 
creditors can make claims against the entrepreneur’s personal assets if the busi￾ness fails to pay its debts. The key strengths and weaknesses of sole proprietor￾ships are summarized in Table 1.1.
Partnerships
A partnership consists of two or more owners doing business together for profit. 
Partnerships account for about 8 percent of all businesses, and they are typically 
larger than sole proprietorships. Partnerships are common in the finance, insur￾ance, and real estate industries. Public accounting and law partnerships often 
have large numbers of partners.
Most partnerships are established by a written contract known as articles of 
partnership. In a general (or regular) partnership, all partners have unlimited lia￾bility, and each partner is legally liable for all of the debts of the partnership. 
Table 1.1 summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of partnerships.

lthough there are vastly more sole proprietorships than there are partnerships and corpora￾tions combined, they generate the lowest level of receipts. In total, sole proprietorships gen￾erated more than $1.3 trillion in receipts, but this number hardly compares to the more than 
$50 trillion in receipts generated by corporations.

Percentage of all receipts 2% 7% 80%ChAPTER 1   The Role of Managerial Finance 53
Corporations
A corporation is an entity created by law. A corporation has the legal powers of 
an individual in that it can sue and be sued, make and be party to contracts, and 
acquire property in its own name. Although only about 20 percent of all U.S. 
businesses are incorporated, the largest businesses nearly always are; corpora￾tions account for roughly 80 percent of total business revenues. Although corpo￾rations engage in all types of businesses, manufacturing firms account for the 
largest portion of corporate business receipts and net profits. Table 1.1 lists the 
key strengths and weaknesses of corporations.
The owners of a corporation are its stockholders, whose ownership, or eq￾uity, takes the form of common stock or, less frequently, preferred stock. Unlike 
the owners of sole proprietorships or partnerships, stockholders of a corporation 
enjoy limited liability, meaning that they are not personally liable for the firm’s 
debts. Their losses are limited to the amount they invested in the firm when they 
purchased shares of stock. In Chapter 7, you will learn more about common 
stock, but for now it is enough to say that common stock is the purest and most 
basic form of corporate ownership. Stockholders expect to earn a return by re￾ceiving dividends—periodic distributions of cash—or by realizing gains through 
increases in share price. Because the money to pay dividends generally comes 
from the profits that a firm earns, stockholders are sometimes referred to as re￾sidual claimants, meaning that stockholders are paid last, after employees,

suppliers, tax authorities, and lenders receive what they are owed. If the firm does 
not generate enough cash to pay everyone else, there is nothing available for 
stockholders.
As noted in the upper portion of Figure 1.1, control of the corporation func￾tions a little like a democracy. The stockholders (owners) vote periodically to elect 
members of the board of directors and to decide other issues such as amending the 
corporate charter. The board of directors is typically responsible for approving 
strategic goals and plans, setting general policy, guiding corporate affairs, and ap￾proving major expenditures. Most importantly, the board decides when to hire or 
fire top managers and establishes compensation packages for the most senior ex￾ecutives. The board consists of “inside” directors, such as key corporate execu￾tives, and “outside” or “independent” directors, such as executives from other 
companies, major shareholders, and national or community leaders. Outside di￾rectors for major corporations receive compensation in the form of cash, stock, 
and stock options. This compensation often totals $100,000 per year or more.
The president or chief executive officer (CEO) is responsible for managing 
day-to-day operations and carrying out the policies established by the board of 
directors. The CEO reports periodically to the firm’s directors.
It is important to note the division between owners and managers in a large 
corporation, as shown by the dashed horizontal line in Figure 1.1. This separation 
and some of the issues surrounding it will be addressed in the discussion of the 
agency issue later in this chapter.

Limited partnership (LP) 
A partnership in which one or 
more partners have limited 
liability as long as at least one 
partner (the general partner) has 
unlimited liability. The limited 
partners are passive investors 
that cannot take an active role in 
the firm’s management.ChAPTER 1   The Role of Managerial Finance 55
Other Limited Liability Organizations
A number of other organizational forms provide owners with limited liability. 
The most popular are limited partnership (LP), S corporation (S corp), limited li￾ability company (LLC), and limited liability partnership (LLP). Each represents a 
specialized form or blending of the characteristics of the organizational forms 
described previously. What they have in common is that their owners enjoy lim￾ited liability, and they typically have fewer than 100 owners.
WhY STudY MANAGERIAL FINANCE?
An understanding of the concepts, techniques, and practices of managerial 
 finance will fully acquaint you with the financial manager’s activities and deci￾sions. Because the consequences of most business decisions are measured in 
 financial terms, the financial manager plays a key operational role. People in all 
areas of responsibility—accounting, information systems, management, market￾ing, operations, and so forth—need a general awareness of finance so that they 
will understand how to quantify the consequences of their actions.
OK, so you’re not planning to major in finance! To improve your chance of 
success in your chosen business career, you still will need to understand how 
 financial managers think. Managers in the firm, regardless of their job descrip￾tions, usually have to provide financial justification for the resources they need to 
do their job. Whether you are hiring new workers, negotiating an advertising 
budget, or upgrading the technology used in a manufacturing process, under￾standing the financial aspects of your actions will help you gain the resources you 
need to be successful. The “Why This Chapter Matters to You” section that ap￾pears on each chapter-opening page should help you understand the importance 
of each chapter in both your professional and personal life.
As you study, you will learn about the career opportunities in managerial 
 finance, which are briefly described in Table 1.2 below. Although we focus on 
publicly held profit-seeking firms, the principles presented are equally applicable 
to private and not-for-profit organizations. The decision-making principles

 1.2 Goal of the Firm
What goal should managers pursue? There is no shortage of possible answers to this 
question. Some might argue that managers should focus entirely on satisfying cus￾tomers. Progress toward this goal could be measured by the market share attained 
by each of the firm’s products. Others suggest that managers must first inspire and 
motivate employees; in that case, employee turnover might be the key success metric 
to watch. Clearly, the goal managers select will affect many of the decisions they 
make, so choosing an objective is a critical determinant of how businesses operate.
MAxIMIZE ShAREhOLdER WEALTh
Finance teaches that managers’ primary goal should be to maximize the wealth of 
the firm’s owners, the stockholders. The simplest and best measure of stockholder 
wealth is the firm’s share price, so most textbooks (ours included) instruct man￾agers to take actions that increase the firm’s share price. A common misconcep￾tion is that when firms strive to make their shareholders happy, they do so at the 
expense of other constituencies such as customers, employees, or suppliers. This 
line of thinking ignores that in most cases, to enrich shareholders, managers must 
first	satisfy	the	demands	of	these	other	interest	groups.	Dividends	that	stockhold￾ers receive ultimately come from the firm’s profits. It is unlikely that a firm whose 
customers are unhappy with its products, whose employees are looking for jobs 
at other firms, or whose suppliers are reluctant to ship raw materials will make 
shareholders rich because such a firm will likely be less profitable in the long run 
than one that better manages its relations with these stakeholder groups.
Therefore, we argue that the goal of the firm, and also of managers, should 
be to maximize the wealth of the owners for whom it is being operated, which in 
LG 3ChAPTER 1   The Role of Managerial Finance 57
most instances is equivalent to maximize the stock price. This goal translates into 
a straightforward decision rule for managers: Only take actions that are expected 
to increase the wealth of shareholders. Although that goal sounds simple, imple￾menting it is not always easy. To determine whether a particular course of action 
will increase or decrease shareholders’ wealth, managers have to assess what re￾turn (that is, cash inflows net of cash outflows) the action will bring and how 
risky that return might be. Figure 1.2 depicts this process. In fact, we can say that 
the key variables that managers must consider when making business decisions 
are return (cash flows) and risk.
MAxIMIZE PROFIT?
It might seem intuitive that maximizing a firm’s share price is equivalent to max￾imizing its profits. That thought is not always correct, however.
Corporations commonly measure profits in terms of earnings per share (EPS),
which represent the amount earned during the period on behalf of each outstand￾ing share of common stock. EPS are calculated by dividing the period’s total earn￾ings available for the firm’s common stockholders by the number of shares of 
common stock outstanding.

In terms of the profit maximization goal, Valve would be preferred over Rotor

EPS compared with $2.80 EPS).
MyFinancelab Solution
Video58 PART 1   Introduction to Managerial Finance
Does	profit	maximization	lead	 to	 the	highest	possible	share	price?	For	at	
least three reasons, the answer is often no. First, timing is important. An invest￾ment that provides a lower profit overall may be preferable to one that earns a 
lower profit in the short run. Second, profits and cash flows are not identical. The 
profit that a firm reports is simply an estimate of how it is doing, an estimate that 
is influenced by many different accounting choices firms make when assembling 
their financial reports. Cash flow is a more straightforward measure of the money 
flowing into and out of the company than profit is. Companies have to pay their 
bills with cash, not earnings, so cash flow is what matters most to financial man￾agers. Third, risk matters a great deal. A firm that earns a low but reliable profit 
might be more valuable than another firm with profits that fluctuate a great deal 
(and therefore can be very high or very low at different times).
Timing
Because the firm can earn a return on funds it receives, the receipt of funds sooner 
rather than later is preferred. In our example, even though the total earnings from 
Rotor are smaller than those from Valve, Rotor provides much greater earnings 
per share in the first year. It’s possible that by investing in Rotor, Neptune Manu￾facturing can reinvest the earnings that it receives in year 1 to generate higher 
profits overall than if it had invested in project Valve. If the rate of return that 
 Neptune can earn on reinvested earnings is high enough, project Rotor may be 
preferred even though it does not alone maximize total profits.
Cash Flows
Profits do not necessarily result in cash flows available to the stockholders. There 
is no guarantee that the board of directors will increase dividends when profits 
increase. In addition, the accounting assumptions and techniques that a firm 
adopts can sometimes allow a firm to show a positive profit even when its cash 
outflows exceed its cash inflows.
Furthermore, higher earnings do not necessarily translate into a higher stock 
price. Only when earnings increases are accompanied by increased future cash 
flows is a higher stock price expected. For example, a firm with a high-quality 
product sold in a very competitive market could increase its earnings by signifi￾cantly reducing its equipment maintenance expenditures. The firm’s expenses 
would be reduced, thereby increasing its profits. If the reduced maintenance re￾sults in lower product quality, however, the firm may impair its competitive posi￾tion, and its stock price could drop as many well-informed investors sell the stock 
in anticipation of lower future cash flows. In this case, the earnings increase was 
accompanied by lower future cash flows and therefore a lower stock price.
Risk
Profit maximization also fails to account for risk, the chance that actual out￾comes may differ from those expected. A basic premise in managerial finance is 
that a trade-off exists between return (cash flow) and risk. Return and risk are, in 
fact, the key determinants of share price, which represents the wealth of the own￾ers in the firm.
Cash	flow	and	risk	affect	share	price	differently:	Holding	risk	fixed,	higher	
cash flow is generally associated with a higher share price. In contrast, holding 
cash flow fixed, higher risk tends to result in a lower share price because the 
risk

outcomes may differ from those 
expected.ChAPTER 1   The Role of Managerial Finance 59
stockholders do not like risk. In general, stockholders are risk averse, which 
means that they are only willing to bear risk if they expect compensation for do￾ing so. In other words, investors expect to earn higher returns on riskier invest￾ments, and they will accept lower returns on relatively safe investments. The key 
point, which will be fully developed in Chapter 5, is that differences in risk can 
significantly affect the value of different investments.
WhAT ABOuT STAKEhOLdERS?
Although maximization of shareholder wealth is the primary goal, many firms 
broaden their focus to include the interests of stakeholders as well as shareholders. 
Stakeholders are groups such as employees, customers, suppliers, creditors, owners, 
and others who have a direct economic link to the firm. A firm with a stakeholder 
focus consciously avoids actions that would prove detrimental to stakeholders. 
The goal is not to maximize stakeholder well-being but to preserve it.
The stakeholder view does not alter the goal of maximizing shareholder 
wealth. Such a view is often considered part of the firm’s “social responsibility.” 
It is expected to provide long-run benefit to shareholders by maintaining positive 
relationships with stakeholders. Such relationships should minimize stakeholder 
turnover, conflicts, and litigation. Clearly, the firm can better achieve its goal of 
shareholder wealth maximization by fostering cooperation with its other stake￾holders rather than conflict with them.
ThE ROLE OF BuSINESS EThICS
Business ethics are the standards of conduct or moral judgment that apply to per￾sons engaged in commerce. Violations of these standards in finance involve a vari￾ety of actions: “creative accounting,” earnings management, misleading financial 
forecasts, insider trading, fraud, excessive executive compensation, options back￾dating, bribery, and kickbacks. The financial press has reported many such viola￾tions in recent years, involving such well-known companies as JP Morgan and 
Capital One. As a result, the financial community is developing and enforcing 
ethical standards. The goal of these ethical standards is to motivate business and

Matter of fact
O
ne way firms can take actions that maximize the wealth of shareholders is by thinking care￾fully about the taxes their shareholders must pay on dividend payments. Starting with the 
Bush tax cuts in 2003, shareholders faced a modest 15 percent tax rate on most dividends. How￾ever, absent congressional action to extend the 2003 tax cuts, the tax rate on dividends would 
jump dramatically in 2013. With a political compromise looking unlikely in the 2012 election 
year, many firms announced plans to accelerate dividend payments that they had planned to 
make in early 2013 to late 2012. Washington Post Company, for example, announced that on 
December 27, 2012, it would pay out the entire $9.80 per share dividend that they had planned 
to distribute in 2013. What was the stock market’s reaction to that announcement? Washington 
Post shares rose $5. By accelerating their dividend payments, companies such as Washington 
Post, Expedia, Inc., and luxury goods producer Coach, Inc., were increasing the wealth of their 
shareholders by helping them save taxes.

market participants to adhere to both the letter and the spirit of laws and regula￾tions concerned with business and professional practice. Most business leaders 
believe that businesses actually strengthen their competitive positions by maintain￾ing high ethical standards.
Considering Ethics
Robert A. Cooke, a noted ethicist, suggests that the following questions be used 
to assess the ethical viability of a proposed action.1
	 1.	 Is	the	action	arbitrary	or	capricious?	Does	it	unfairly	single	out	an	individual	
or group?
	 2.	Does	the	action	violate	the	moral	or	legal	rights	of	any	individual	or	group?
	 3.	Does	the	action	conform	to	accepted	moral	standards?
 4. Are there alternative courses of action that are less likely to cause actual or 
potential harm?
Clearly, considering such questions before taking an action can help ensure its 
ethical viability.
Today, many firms are addressing the issue of ethics by establishing corpo￾rate ethics policies that outline a set of fundamental principles that guide what 
firms’ employees must do or what they must not do. Some firms go further and 
make their ethical standards a centerpiece of their corporate image. For example, 
Google	famously	adopted	the	motto,	“Don’t	be	evil.”	Even	for	Google,	however,	
ethical dilemmas are unavoidable in business. The Focus on Ethics box provides 
an example of ethical concerns raised by a new Google product, Google Glass.
A major impetus toward the development of ethics policies has been the Sar￾banes-Oxley Act of 2002. The act requires firms to disclose whether they have a 
code of ethics in place, and firms must report any waivers of those codes for se￾nior management. Companies that do not have a code of ethics must explain why 
they have not adopted one. Many firms require their employees to sign a formal 
pledge to uphold the firm’s ethics policies. Such policies typically apply to em￾ployee actions in dealing with all corporate stakeholders, including the public.
EThICS ANd ShARE PRICE
An effective ethics program can enhance corporate value by producing a number 
of positive benefits. It can reduce potential litigation and judgment costs, maintain 
a positive corporate image, build shareholder confidence, and gain the loyalty, 
commitment, and respect of the firm’s stakeholders. Such actions, by maintaining 
and enhancing cash flow and reducing perceived risk, can positively affect the 
firm’s share price. Ethical behavior is therefore viewed as necessary for achieving 
the firm’s goal of owner wealth maximization.

 1.3 Managerial Finance Function
People in all areas of responsibility within the firm must interact with finance 
personnel and procedures to get their jobs done. For financial personnel to make 
useful forecasts and decisions, they must be willing and able to talk to individu￾als in other areas of the firm. For example, when considering a new product, the 
financial manager needs to obtain sales forecasts, pricing guidelines, and adver￾tising and promotion budget estimates from marketing personnel. The manage￾rial finance function can be broadly described by considering its role within the 
organization, its relationship to economics and accounting, and the primary ac￾tivities of the financial manager.
LG 4 LG 5
On June 27, 2012, at 
the Google I/O confer￾ence, Google introduced an exciting 
new product called Glass. Essentially a 
computer that users wear like a pair of 
eyeglasses, Google Glass performs 
many of the functions of a smart phone 
without requiring people to use their 
hands. To demonstrate the new product’s 
capabilities, Google cofounder Sergey 
Brin parachuted out of a zeppelin wear￾ing Glass and transmitted his descent 
live to those attending the conference.
Google offers an interesting case 
study on value maximization and corpo￾rate ethics. In 2004, Google’s founders 
provided “An Owner’s Manual” for 
shareholders, which stated that “Google 
is not a conventional company” and 
that the company’s ultimate goal “is to 
develop services that significantly im￾prove the lives of as many people as 
possible.” The founders stressed that it 
was not enough for Google to run a 
successful business; they also want to 
use the company to make the world a 
better place. Brin’s skydiving stunt made 
it clear that Google had come up with 
yet another product that would thrill cus￾tomers. But what effect would Google 
Glass have on the general public? Re￾porters who wrote about high-tech prod￾ucts quickly shifted the focus of their sto￾ries from what it would be like to wear 
Google Glass to what it would be like 
to be around someone else wearing the 
product. The device obviously raised 
big concerns about the privacy of non￾users. One Twitter user posted: “There is 
a kid using Google Glasses at this res￾taurant, which, until just now, used to 
be my favorite spot.”
Google’s famous corporate motto, 
“Don’t Be Evil,” is intended to convey 
Google’s willingness to do the right 
thing even when doing so requires the 
firm to sacrifice in the short run. 
Google’s approach does not appear to 
be limiting its ability to maximize value, 
as the company’s share price increased 
more than 700 percent from 2004 to 
2013! As this book was going to press, 
however, it remained unclear how 
Google might respond to critics of its 
Glass device.

ORGANIZATION OF ThE FINANCE FuNCTION
The size and importance of the managerial finance function depend on the size of 
the firm. In small firms, the finance function is generally performed by the ac￾counting department. As a firm grows, the finance function typically evolves into 
a separate department linked directly to the company president or CEO through 
the chief financial officer (CFO). The lower portion of the organizational chart in 
Figure 1.1 on page 54 shows the structure of the finance function in a typical 
medium- to large-size firm.
Reporting to the CFO are the treasurer and the controller. The treasurer (the 
chief financial manager) typically manages the firm’s cash, investing surplus 
funds when available and securing outside financing when needed. The treasurer 
also oversees a firm’s pension plans and manages critical risks related to move￾ments in foreign currency values, interest rates, and commodity prices. The con￾troller (the chief accountant) typically handles the accounting activities, such as 
corporate accounting, tax management, financial accounting, and cost account￾ing. The treasurer’s focus tends to be more external, whereas the controller’s 
 focus is more internal.
If international sales or purchases are important to a firm, it may well em￾ploy one or more finance professionals whose job is to monitor and manage the 
firm’s exposure to loss from currency fluctuations. A trained financial manager 
can “hedge,” or protect against such a loss, at a reasonable cost by using a variety 
of financial instruments. These foreign exchange managers typically report to the 
firm’s treasurer.
RELATIONShIP TO ECONOMICS
The field of finance is closely related to economics. Financial managers must un￾derstand the economic framework and be alert to the consequences of varying 
levels of economic activity and changes in economic policy. They must also be 
able to use economic theories as guidelines for efficient business operation. Ex￾amples include supply-and-demand analysis, profit-maximizing strategies, and 
price theory. The primary economic principle used in managerial finance is mar￾ginal cost–benefit analysis, the principle that financial decisions should be made 
and actions taken only when the added benefits exceed the added costs. Nearly 
all financial decisions ultimately come down to an assessment of their marginal 
benefits and marginal costs.

upscale department stores operating primarily in the western United States. She is 
currently trying to decide whether to replace one of the firm’s computer servers 
with a new, more sophisticated one that would both speed processing and handle 
a larger volume of transactions. The new computer would require a cash outlay 
of $8,000, and the old computer could be sold to net $2,000. The total benefits 
from the new server (measured in today’s dollars) would be $10,000. The bene￾fits over a similar time period from the old computer (measured in today’s dol￾lars) would be $3,000. Applying marginal cost–benefit analysis, Jamie organizes 
the data as follows:
Example 1.2 ▶ChAPTER 1   The Role of Managerial Finance 63
Because the marginal (added) benefits of $7,000 exceed the marginal (added) 
costs of $6,000, Jamie recommends that the firm purchase the new computer to 
replace the old one. The firm will experience a net benefit of $1,000 as a result of 
this action.
RELATIONShIP TO ACCOuNTING
The firm’s finance and accounting activities are closely related and generally 
overlap. In small firms, accountants often carry out the finance function; in large 
firms, financial analysts often help compile accounting information. There are, 
however, two differences between finance and accounting; one is related to the 
emphasis on cash flows, and the other is related to decision making.
Emphasis on Cash Flows
The accountant’s primary function is to develop and report data for measuring 
the performance of the firm, assess its financial position, comply with and file 
reports required by securities regulators, and file and pay taxes. Using generally 
accepted accounting principles, the accountant prepares financial statements that 
recognize revenue at the time of sale (whether payment has been received or not) 
and recognize expenses when they are incurred. This approach is referred to as 
the accrual basis.
The financial manager, on the other hand, places primary emphasis on cash 
flows,	the	intake	and	outgo	of	cash.	He	or	she	maintains	the	firm’s	solvency	by	
planning the cash flows necessary to satisfy its obligations and to acquire assets 
needed to achieve the firm’s goals. The financial manager uses this cash basis to 
recognize the revenues and expenses only with respect to actual inflows and out￾flows of cash. Whether a firm earns a profit or experiences a loss, it must have a 
sufficient flow of cash to meet its obligations as they come due.

view of the firm’s performance during the year are given by the following income

In an accounting sense, Nassau Corporation is profitable, but in terms of actual 
cash flow, it is a financial failure. Its lack of cash flow resulted from the uncol￾lected accounts receivable of $100,000. Without adequate cash inflows to meet 
its obligations, the firm will not survive, regardless of its level of profits.
As the example shows, accrual accounting data do not fully describe the cir￾cumstances of a firm. Thus, the financial manager must look beyond financial 
statements to obtain insight into existing or developing problems. Of course, ac￾countants are well aware of the importance of cash flows, and financial managers 
use and understand accrual-based financial statements. Nevertheless, the finan￾cial manager, by concentrating on cash flows, should be able to avoid insolvency 
and achieve the firm’s financial goals.

Individuals do not use accrual concepts. Rather, they rely 
solely on cash flows to measure their financial outcomes. Gen￾erally, individuals plan, monitor, and assess their financial activities using cash 
flows over a given period, typically a month or a year. Ann Bach projects her cash 
flows during October 2015 as follows:

to reduce her outflows in areas of discretionary spending such as clothing pur￾chases, dining out, or areas that make up the $425 of miscellaneous expense.
decision Making
The second major difference between finance and accounting has to do with 
decision making. Accountants devote most of their attention to the collection 
and presentation of financial data. Financial managers evaluate the accounting 
statements, develop additional data, and make decisions on the basis of their 
assessment of the associated returns and risks. Of course, it does not mean that 
accountants never make decisions or that financial managers never gather data 
but rather that the primary focuses of accounting and finance are distinctly 
different.
PRIMARY ACTIVITIES OF ThE FINANCIAL MANAGER
In addition to ongoing involvement in financial analysis and planning, the finan￾cial manager’s primary activities are making investment and financing decisions. 
Investment decisions determine what types of assets the firm holds. Financing 
decisions determine how the firm raises money to pay for the assets in which it 
invests. One way to visualize the difference between a firm’s investment and fi￾nancing decisions is to refer to the balance sheet shown in Figure 1.3. Investment 
decisions generally refer to the items that appear on the left-hand side of the bal￾ance sheet, and financing decisions relate to the items on the right-hand side. 
Keep in mind, though, that financial managers make these decisions based on 
their effect on the value of the firm, not on the accounting principles used to con￾struct a balance sheet.

 1.4 Governance and Agency
The majority of owners of a corporation are normally distinct from its managers. 
Managers are nevertheless entrusted to only take actions or make decisions that 
are in the best interests of the firm’s owners, its shareholders. In most cases, if 
managers fail to act on the behalf of the shareholders, they will also fail to achieve 
the goal of maximizing shareholder wealth. To help ensure that managers act in 
ways that are consistent with the interests of shareholders and mindful of obliga￾tions to other stakeholders, firms aim to establish sound corporate governance 
practices.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Corporate governance refers to the rules, processes, and laws by which compa￾nies are operated, controlled, and regulated. It defines the rights and responsibili￾ties of the corporate participants such as the shareholders, board of directors, 
officers and managers, and other stakeholders as well as the rules and procedures 
for making corporate decisions. A well-defined corporate governance structure is 
intended to benefit all corporate stakeholders by ensuring that the firm is run in a 
lawful and ethical fashion, in accordance with best practices, and subject to all 
corporate regulations.
A firm’s corporate governance is influenced by both internal factors such as 
the shareholders, board of directors, and officers as well as external forces such 
as clients, creditors, suppliers, competitors, and government regulations. The cor￾porate organization, depicted in Figure 1.1 on page 54, helps shape a firm’s 
 corporate governance structure. In particular, the stockholders elect a board of 
directors, who in turn hire officers or managers to operate the firm in a manner 
consistent with the goals, plans, and policies established and monitored by the 
board on behalf of the shareholders.
Individual versus Institutional Investors
To better understand the role that shareholders play in shaping a firm’s corporate 
governance, it is helpful to differentiate between the two broad classes of owners: 
individuals and institutions. Generally, individual investors own relatively few 
shares and as a result do not typically have sufficient means to influence a firm’s 
corporate governance. To influence the firm, individual investors often find it 
necessary to act as a group by voting collectively on corporate matters. The most 
important corporate matter individual investors vote on is the election of the 
firm’s board of directors. The corporate board’s first responsibility is to the 
shareholders. The board not only sets policies that specify ethical practices and 
provide for the protection of stakeholder interests, but it also monitors manage￾rial decision making on behalf of investors.
Although they also benefit from the presence of the board of directors, insti￾tutional investors have advantages over individual investors when it comes to in￾fluencing the corporate governance of a firm. Institutional investors are invest￾ment professionals that are paid to manage and hold large quantities of securities 
on behalf of individuals, businesses, and governments. Institutional investors in￾clude banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, and pension funds. Unlike indi￾vidual investors, institutional investors often monitor and directly influence a

firm’s corporate governance by exerting pressure on management to perform or 
communicating their concerns to the firm’s board. These large investors can also 
threaten to exercise their voting rights or liquidate their holdings if the board 
does not respond positively to their concerns. Because individual and institutional 
investors share the same goal, individual investors benefit from the shareholder 
activism of institutional investors.
Government Regulation
Unlike the effect that clients, creditors, suppliers, or competitors can have on a 
particular firm’s corporate governance, government regulation generally shapes 
the	corporate	governance	of	all	firms.	During	the	past	decade,	corporate	gover￾nance has received increased attention due to several high-profile corporate 
scandals involving abuse of corporate power and, in some cases, alleged criminal 
activity by corporate officers. The misdeeds derived from two main types of is￾sues: (1) false disclosures in financial reporting and other material information 
releases and (2) undisclosed conflicts of interest between corporations and their 
analysts, auditors, and attorneys and between corporate directors, officers, and 
shareholders.
Asserting that an integral part of an effective corporate governance regime 
is provisions for civil or criminal prosecution of individuals who conduct un￾ethical or illegal acts in the name of the firm, in July 2002 the U.S. Congress 
passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (commonly called SOX). Sarbanes-Oxley 
is intended to eliminate many of the disclosure and conflict of interest problems 
that can arise when corporate managers are not held personally accountable for 
their firm’s financial decisions and disclosures. SOX accomplished the follow￾ing: established an oversight board to monitor the accounting industry, tight￾ened audit regulations and controls, toughened penalties against executives 
who commit corporate fraud, strengthened accounting disclosure requirements 
and ethical guidelines for corporate officers, established corporate board struc￾ture and membership guidelines, established guidelines with regard to analyst 
conflicts of interest, mandated instant disclosure of stock sales by corporate 
executives, and increased securities regulation authority and budgets for audi￾tors and investigators.
ThE AGENCY ISSuE
We know that the duty of the financial manager is to maximize the wealth of the 
firm’s owners. Shareholders give managers decision-making authority over the 
firm; thus, managers can be viewed as the agents of the firm’s shareholders. Tech￾nically, any manager who owns less than 100 percent of the firm is an agent act￾ing on behalf of other owners. This separation of owners and managers is shown 
by the dashed horizontal line in Figure 1.1 on page 54, and it is representative of 
the classic principal–agent relationship, where the shareholders are the principals. 
In general, a contract is used to specify the terms of a principal–agent relation￾ship. This arrangement works well when the agent makes decisions that are in the 
principal’s best interest but doesn’t work well when the interests of the principal 
and agent differ.
In theory, most financial managers would agree with the goal of shareholder 
wealth maximization. In reality, however, managers are also concerned with 
their personal wealth, job security, and fringe benefits. Such concerns may cause

managers to make decisions that are not consistent with shareholder wealth 
maximization. For example, financial managers may be reluctant or unwilling to 
take more than moderate risk if they perceive that taking too much risk might 
jeopardize their job or reduce their personal wealth.
The Agency Problem
An important theme of corporate governance is to ensure the accountability of 
managers in an organization through mechanisms that try to reduce or elimi￾nate the principal–agent problem; when these mechanisms fail, however, agency 
problems arise. Agency problems arise when managers deviate from the goal of 
maximization of shareholder wealth by placing their personal goals ahead of 
the goals of shareholders. These problems in turn give rise to agency costs. 
Agency costs are costs borne by shareholders due to the presence or avoidance 
of agency problems and in either case represent a loss of shareholder wealth. 
For example, shareholders incur agency costs when managers fail to make the 
best investment decision or when managers have to be monitored to ensure that 
the best investment decision is made because either situation is likely to result in 
a lower stock price.
Management Compensation Plans
In addition to the roles played by corporate boards, institutional investors, and 
government regulations, corporate governance can be strengthened by ensuring 
that managers’ interests are aligned with those of shareholders. A common ap￾proach is to structure management compensation to correspond with firm perfor￾mance. In addition to combating agency problems, the resulting performance￾based compensation packages allow firms to compete for and hire the best 
managers available. The two key types of managerial compensation plans are in￾centive plans and performance plans.
Incentive plans tie management compensation to share price. One incentive 
plan grants stock options to management. If the firm’s stock price rises over time, 
managers will be rewarded by being able to purchase stock at the market price in 
effect at the time of the grant and then to resell the shares at the prevailing higher 
market price.
Many firms also offer performance plans that tie management compensation 
to performance measures such as earnings per share (EPS) or growth in EPS. 
Compensation under these plans is often in the form of performance shares or 
cash bonuses. Performance shares are shares of stock given to management as a 
result of meeting the stated performance goals, whereas cash bonuses are cash 
payments tied to the achievement of certain performance goals.
The execution of many compensation plans has been closely scrutinized in 
light of the past decade’s corporate scandals and financial woes. Both individual 
and institutional stockholders as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) and other government entities continue to publicly question the appropri￾ateness of the multimillion-dollar compensation packages that many corporate 
executives receive. The total compensation in 2012 for the chief executive officers 
of the 500 largest U.S. companies is considerable. For example, the three highest￾paid CEOs in 2012 were Larry Ellison of Oracle Corp., who earned $96.2 mil￾lion;	Richard	Bracken	of	HCA,	who	earned	$38.6	million;	and	Robert	Iger	of	
Disney,	who	earned	$37.1	million.

The Threat of Takeover
When a firm’s internal corporate governance structure is unable to keep agency 
problems in check, it is likely that rival managers will try to gain control of the 
firm. Because agency problems represent a misuse of the firm’s resources and 
impose agency costs on the firm’s shareholders, the firm’s stock is generally de￾pressed, making the firm an attractive takeover target. The threat of takeover by 
another firm that believes it can enhance the troubled firm’s value by restructur￾ing its management, operations, and financing can provide a strong source of 
external corporate governance. The constant threat of a takeover tends to moti￾vate management to act in the best interests of the firm’s owners.
Unconstrained, managers may have other goals in addition to share price 
maximization, but much of the evidence suggests that share price maximization—
the focus of this text—is the primary goal of most firms.
Matter of fact
A
quick look at the compensation awarded to some of the highest paid CEOs in 2012 reveals 
that the link between pay and performance is not as strong as one might think. Oracle CEO 
Larry Ellison earned the highest pay during a year in which Oracle stock lost 22 percent of its 
value. Whirlpool’s chairman, Jeff Fettig, earned less than one-seventh as much as Ellison, but 
Whirlpool’s stock earned a return of almost 120 percent in 2012 (not shown in the table).
How Closely Are Pay and Performance Linked?

Most studies have failed to find a strong relationship between the performance that companies 
achieve and the compensation that CEOs receive. From 2007 to 2010, publicity surrounding 
these large compensation packages combined with weakness in the overall economy put down￾ward pressure on executive compensation. Among the 500 largest U.S. companies, average CEO 
pay fell roughly 50 percent during this period. Contributing to negative publicity surrounding 
the pay-for-performance issue is the SEC requirement that publicly traded companies disclose 
to shareholders and others the amount of compensation paid to their CEO, CFO, three other 
 highest-paid executives, and directors; the method used to determine it; and a narrative discussion 
regarding the underlying compensation policies. At the same time, new compensation plans that 
better link managers’ performance to their compensation are being developed and implemented. 
As evidence of this trend, a survey of 50 large companies revealed that in 2009 only 35 percent 
of the compensation paid to CEOs was tied to company performance, but by 2012, those same 
50 companies reported that 51 percent of CEO pay was linked to performance.70 PART 1   Introduction to Managerial Finance

FOCuS ON VALuE
This chapter established the primary goal of the firm: to maximize the wealth of 
the owners for whom the firm is being operated. For public companies, value at 
any time is reflected in the stock price. Therefore, management should act only 
on those opportunities that are expected to create value for owners by increas￾ing	the	stock	price.	Doing	so	requires	management	to	consider	the	returns	(mag￾nitude and timing of cash flows), the risk of each proposed action, and their 
combined effect on value.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
LG 1 Define finance and the managerial finance function. Finance is the science 
and art of managing money. It affects virtually all aspects of business. Manage￾rial finance is concerned with the duties of the financial manager working in a 
business. Financial managers administer the financial affairs of all types of busi￾nesses: private and public, large and small, profit seeking and not for profit. 
They perform such varied tasks as developing a financial plan or budget, ex￾tending credit to customers, evaluating proposed large expenditures, and raising 
money to fund the firm’s operations.
LG 2 Describe the legal forms of business organization. The legal forms of busi￾ness organization are the sole proprietorship, the partnership, and the corpora￾tion. The corporation is dominant in terms of business receipts, and its owners 
are its stockholders. Stockholders expect to earn a return by receiving dividends 
or by realizing gains through increases in share price.
LG 3 Describe the goal of the firm, and explain why maximizing the value of 
the firm is an appropriate goal for a business. The goal of the firm is to maxi￾mize its value and therefore the wealth of its shareholders. Maximizing the ChAPTER 1   The Role of Managerial Finance 71
value of the firm means running the business in the interest of those who own 
it, the shareholders. Because shareholders are paid after other stakeholders, it 
is generally necessary to satisfy the interests of other stakeholders to enrich 
shareholders.
LG 4 Describe how the managerial finance function is related to economics and 
accounting. All areas of responsibility within a firm interact with finance per￾sonnel and procedures. The financial manager must understand the economic 
environment and rely heavily on the economic principle of marginal cost–benefit 
analysis to make financial decisions. Financial managers use accounting but con￾centrate on cash flows and decision making.
LG 5
Identify the primary activities of the financial manager. The primary ac￾tivities of the financial manager, in addition to ongoing involvement in financial 
analysis and planning, are making investment decisions and making financing 
decisions.
LG 6 Describe the nature of the principal–agent relationship between the owners 
and managers of a corporation, and explain how various corporate governance 
mechanisms attempt to manage agency problems. This separation of owners and 
managers of the typical firm is representative of the classic principal–agent rela￾tionship, where the shareholders are the principals and managers are the agents. 
This arrangement works well when the agent makes decisions that are in the 
principal’s best interest, but it can lead to agency problems when the interests of 
the principal and agent differ. A firm’s corporate governance structure is in￾tended to help ensure that managers act in the best interests of the firm’s share￾holders and other stakeholders, and it is usually influenced by both internal and 
external factors.

Spreadsheet Exercise
 Assume that Monsanto Corporation is considering the replacement of some of its older 
and outdated carpet-manufacturing equipment. Its objective is to improve the 
efficiency of operations in terms of both speed and reduction in the number of 
defects. The company’s finance department has compiled pertinent data that will 
allow it to conduct a marginal cost–benefit analysis for the proposed equipment 
replacement.
 The cash outlay for new equipment would be approximately $600,000. The net 
book value of the old equipment and its potential net selling price add up to $250,000. 
The total benefits from the new equipment (measured in today’s dollars) would be 
$900,000. The benefits of the old equipment over a similar period of time (measured 
in today’s dollars) would be $300,000.

F
or decades, Phoenix, Arizona, was thriving. Its 
sunny, dry weather attracted retirees from colder 
and wetter climates in the United States, and the tech￾nology industry brought thousands of new jobs to the 
city. The boom in Phoenix was reflected in the area’s 
house prices. Starting in September 1992, the average 
price of a home in Phoenix rose for 166 consecutive 
months, in the process increasing by almost 250 per￾cent. All that began to unravel in June 2006 when 
house prices started to fall. They reached bottom in Au￾gust 2011, dropping more than 56 percent in 5 years. It was bad news for homeowners in 
Phoenix, but financial markets helped spread this bad news around the world.
Consider the position of a home buyer who purchased a $300,000 home in Phoenix in 
June 2006. Suppose that the buyer purchased the home with $30,000 of his or her own money 
and a 30-year mortgage for $270,000 obtained from a local bank. Five years later, the home 
was worth just $150,000, much less than the outstanding mortgage balance, meaning that the 
homeowner had “negative equity” in the house. Many homeowners in this position defaulted on 
their mortgages. Through a process called securitization, mortgages that had been taken out by 
home buyers in Phoenix were sold to banks and other investors all over the country; thus, mort￾gage defaults had consquences that were felt a long way from the Arizona desert. Although the 
decline in house prices was more severe in Phoenix than in most other places, home prices were 
falling in nearly every major U.S. city, and mortgage defaults were rising rapidly. The nation’s 
largest banks appeared to be near collapse in 2008, which led the U.S. government to take a 
variety of steps in an attempt to “bail out” ailing financial institutions. Credit became more diffi￾cult for borrowers to obtain, contributing to the deepest and longest lasting recession since the 
Great Depression.
The experience of the financial crisis and the recession that followed illustrates how im￾portant financial markets are to the functioning of a market economy. Financial markets help 
transfer funds from savers to borrowers, and the smooth flow of credit is vital to the health of 
the economy. When that flow is interrupted and firms are denied access to credit, they invest 
less and hire fewer people. In this chapter, you will see how financial markets help allocate 
capital, and you will learn about efforts that policy makers have made to try to prevent another 
financial crisis.

financial institution
An intermediary that channels 
the savings of individuals, 
businesses, and governments 
into loans or investments.
 2.1 Financial Institutions and Markets
Most successful firms have ongoing needs for funds. They can obtain funds from 
external sources in three ways. The first source is through a financial institution
that accepts savings and transfers them to those that need funds. A second source 
is through financial markets, organized forums in which the suppliers and de￾manders of various types of funds can make transactions. A third source is 
through private placement. Because of the unstructured nature of private place￾ments, here we focus primarily on the role of financial institutions and financial 
markets in facilitating business financing.
FINANCIAL INSTITuTIONS
Financial institutions serve as intermediaries by channeling the savings of indi￾viduals, businesses, and governments into loans or investments. Many financial 
institutions directly or indirectly pay savers interest on deposited funds; others 
provide services for a fee (for example, checking accounts for which customers 
pay service charges). Some financial institutions accept customers’ savings depos￾its and lend this money to other customers or to firms, others invest customers’ 
savings in earning assets such as real estate or stocks and bonds, and some do 
both. Financial institutions are required by the government to operate within es￾tablished regulatory guidelines.
Key Customers of Financial Institutions
For financial institutions, the key suppliers of funds and the key demanders of 
funds are individuals, businesses, and governments. The savings that individual 
consumers place in financial institutions provide these institutions with a large 
portion of their funds. Individuals not only supply funds to financial institutions 
but also demand funds from them in the form of loans. However, individuals as 
a group are the net suppliers for financial institutions: They save more money 
than they borrow.
Business firms also deposit some of their funds in financial institutions, pri￾marily in checking accounts with various commercial banks. Like individuals, 
firms borrow funds from these institutions, but firms are net demanders of funds: 
They borrow more money than they save.
Governments maintain deposits of temporarily idle funds, certain tax 
payments, and Social Security payments in commercial banks. They do not 
borrow funds directly from financial institutions, although by selling their 
debt securities to various institutions, governments indirectly borrow from 
them. The government, like business firms, is typically a net demander of 
funds: It typically borrows more than it saves. We’ve all heard about the fed￾eral budget deficit.
Major Financial Institutions
The major financial institutions in the U.S. economy are commercial banks, sav￾ings and loans, credit unions, savings banks, insurance companies, mutual funds, 
and pension funds. These institutions attract funds from individuals, businesses, 
and governments, combine them, and make loans available to individuals and 
businesses.

COMMERCIAL BANKS, INVESTMENT BANKS, ANd ThE 
ShAdOW BANKING SYSTEM
Commercial banks are among the most important financial institutions in the 
economy because they provide savers with a secure place to invest funds and they 
offer both individuals and companies loans to finance investments, such as the 
purchase of a new home or the expansion of a business. Investment banks are 
institutions that (1) assist companies in raising capital, (2) advise firms on major 
transactions such as mergers or financial restructurings, and (3) engage in trading 
and market making activities.
The traditional business model of a commercial bank—taking in and paying 
interest on deposits and investing or lending those funds back out at higher inter￾est rates—works to the extent that depositors believe that their investments are 
secure. Since the 1930s, the U.S. government has given some assurance to deposi￾tors that their money is safe by providing deposit insurance (currently up to 
$250,000 per depositor). Deposit insurance was put in place in response to the 
banking runs or panics that were part of the Great Depression. The same act of 
Congress that introduced deposit insurance, the Glass-Steagall Act, also created a 
separation between commercial banks and investment banks, meaning that an 
institution engaged in taking in deposits could not also engage in the somewhat 
riskier activities of securities underwriting and trading.
Commercial and investment banks remained essentially separate for more 
than 50 years, but Congress, with the approval of President Bill Clinton, de￾cided to repeal Glass-Steagall in 1999. Companies that had formerly engaged 
only in the traditional activities of a commercial bank began competing with 
investment banks for underwriting and other services. In addition, the 1990s 
witnessed tremendous growth in what has come to be known as the shadow 
banking system. The shadow banking system describes a group of institutions 
that engage in lending activities, much like traditional banks, but these institu￾tions do not accept deposits and are therefore not subject to the same regula￾tions as traditional banks. For example, an institution such as a pension fund 
might have excess cash to invest, and a large corporation might need short-term 
financing to cover seasonal cash flow needs. A business like Lehman Brothers, 
which filed for bankruptcy in the early days of the 2008 financial crisis, acted 
as an intermediary between these two parties and helped facilitate a loan, 
thereby becoming part of the shadow banking system. In March 2010, Trea￾sury Secretary Timothy Geithner noted that at its peak the shadow banking 
system financed roughly $8 trillion in assets and was roughly as large as the 
traditional banking system.

Consolidation in the U.S. Banking Industry
T
he U.S. banking industry has been going through a long period of consolidation. According 
to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the number of commercial banks in the 
United States declined from 11,463 in 1992 to 6,048 as of March 2013, a decline of 47 percent. 
The decline is concentrated among small community banks, which larger institutions have been ac￾quiring at a rapid pace.80 PART 1   Introduction to Managerial Finance
FINANCIAL MARKETS
Financial markets are forums in which suppliers of funds and demanders of funds 
can transact business directly. Whereas the loans made by financial institutions 
are granted without the direct knowledge of the suppliers of funds (savers), sup￾pliers in the financial markets know where their funds are being lent or invested. 
The two key financial markets are the money market and the capital market. 
Transactions in short-term debt instruments, or marketable securities, take place 
in the money market. Long-term securities—bonds and stocks—are traded in the 
capital market.
To raise money, firms can use either private placements or public offerings. A 
private placement involves the sale of a new security directly to an investor or 
group of investors, such as an insurance company or pension fund. Most firms, 
however, raise money through a public offering of securities, which is the sale of 
either bonds or stocks to the general public.
When a company or government entity sells stocks or bonds to investors and 
receives cash in return, it is said to have sold securities in the primary market. After 
the primary market transaction occurs, any further trading in the security does not 
involve the issuer directly, and the issuer receives no additional money from these 
subsequent transactions. Once the securities begin to trade between investors, they 
become part of the secondary market. On large stock exchanges, billions of shares 
may trade between buyers and sellers on a single day, and these trades are all sec￾ondary market transactions. Money flows from the investors buying stocks to the 
investors selling them, and the company whose stock is being traded is largely unaf￾fected by the transactions. The primary market is the one in which “new” securities 
are sold. The secondary market can be viewed as a “preowned” securities market.
ThE RELATIONShIP BETWEEN INSTITuTIONS ANd MARKETS
Financial institutions actively participate in the financial markets as both suppli￾ers and demanders of funds. Figure 2.1 depicts the general flow of funds through

and governments may supply and demand funds. We next briefly discuss the 
money market, including its international equivalent: the Eurocurrency market.
We then end this section with a discussion of the capital market, which is of key 
importance to the firm.
ThE MONEY MARKET
The money market is created by a financial relationship between suppliers and 
demanders of short-term funds (funds with maturities of 1 year or less). The 
money market exists because some individuals, businesses, governments, and fi￾nancial institutions have temporarily idle funds that they wish to invest in a rela￾tively safe, interest-bearing asset. At the same time, other individuals, businesses, 
governments, and financial institutions find themselves in need of seasonal or 
temporary financing. The money market brings together these suppliers and de￾manders of short-term funds.
Most money market transactions are made in marketable securities, which are 
short-term debt instruments such as U.S. Treasury bills, commercial paper, and nego￾tiable certificates of deposit issued by government, business, and financial institu￾tions, respectively. Investors generally consider marketable securities to be among the 
least risky investments available. Marketable securities are described in Chapter 15.
The international equivalent of the domestic money market is called the 
Eurocurrency market. This market for short-term bank deposits is denominated 
in U.S. dollars or other major currencies. Eurocurrency deposits arise when a cor￾poration or individual makes a bank deposit in a currency other than the local 
currency of the country where the bank is located. For example, if a multinational 
corporation were to deposit U.S. dollars in a London bank, this action would cre￾ate a Eurodollar deposit (a dollar deposit at a bank in Europe). Nearly all Euro￾dollar deposits are time deposits, which means that the bank would promise to 
repay the deposit, with interest, at a fixed date in the future, in 6 months, for ex￾ample. During the interim, the bank is free to lend this dollar deposit to credit￾worthy corporate or government borrowers. If the bank cannot find a borrower 
on its own, it may lend the deposit to another international bank.
ThE CAPITAL MARKET
The capital market is a market that enables suppliers and demanders of long-term 
funds to make transactions. Included are securities issues of business and govern￾ment. The backbone of the capital market is formed by the broker and dealer 
markets that provide a forum for bond and stock transactions. International cap￾ital markets also exist.
Key Securities Traded: Bonds and Stocks
The key capital market securities are bonds (long-term debt) and both common
stock and preferred stock (equity, or ownership).
Bonds are long-term debt instruments used by business and government to 
raise large sums of money, generally from a diverse group of lenders. Corporate 
bonds typically pay interest semiannually (every 6 months) at a stated coupon 
interest rate. They have an initial maturity of from 10 to 30 years, and a par, or 
face, value of $l,000 that must be repaid at maturity. Bonds are described in de￾tail in Chapter 7.

Lakeview Industries, a major microprocessor manufacturer, has issued a 9% cou￾pon interest rate, 20-year bond with a $1,000 par value that pays interest semiannu￾ally. Investors who buy this bond receive the contractual right to $90 annual interest 
(9% coupon interest rate * $1,000 par value) distributed as $45 at the end of each 
6 months (1>2 * $90) for 20 years, plus the $1,000 par value at the end of year 20.
As noted earlier, shares of common stock are units of ownership, or equity, 
in a corporation. Common stockholders earn a return by receiving dividends—
periodic distributions of cash—or by realizing increases in share price. Preferred 
stock is a special form of ownership that has features of both a bond and com￾mon stock. Preferred stockholders are promised a fixed periodic dividend that 
must be paid prior to payment of any dividends to common stockholders. In 
other words, preferred stock has “preference” over common stock. Preferred 
stock and common stock are described in detail in Chapter 8. See the Focus on 
Practice box for the story of one legendary stock price and the equally legendary 
man who brought it about.
Broker Markets and dealer Markets
By far, the vast majority of trades made by individual investors take place in the 
secondary market. Trading mechanisms and processes in the secondary market 
have evolved rapidly in recent years. In the past, it was possible to classify the 
secondary market into two segments on the basis of how securities were traded.
Those two segments were broker markets and dealer markets. Those segments 
are still relevant today, but the distinctions between them are not as sharp as they 
once were.
The key difference between broker and dealer markets is a technical point 
dealing with the way trades are executed. That is, when a trade occurs in a broker 
market, the two sides to the transaction, the buyer and the seller, are brought 
together, and the trade takes place at that point: Party A sells his or her securities 
directly to the buyer, Party B. In a sense, with the help of a broker, the securities 
effectively change hands, perhaps literally on the floor of the exchange. The bro￾ker market consists of national and regional securities exchanges, which are orga￾nizations that provide a marketplace in which firms can raise funds through the 
sale of new securities and purchasers can resell securities.
In contrast, when trades are made in a dealer market, the buyer and the seller 
are never brought together directly. Instead, market makers execute the buy/sell 
orders. Market makers are securities dealers who “make markets” by offering to 
buy or sell certain securities at stated prices. Essentially, two separate trades are 
made: Party A sells his or her securities (in, say, Dell) to a dealer, and Party B 
buys his or her securities (in Dell) from another, or possibly even the same, dealer. 
Thus, there is always a dealer (market maker) on one side of a dealer–market 
transaction. The dealer market is made up of both the Nasdaq market, an all￾electronic trading platform used to execute securities trades, and the over-the￾counter (OTC) market, where smaller, unlisted securities are traded.
In recent years, the distinctions between broker and dealer markets have 
blurred. Electronic trading platforms using sophisticated algorithms place buy and 
sell orders very rapidly (so-called high-frequency trading), often without any hu￾man intervention. These algorithms may be used to speculate on a stock’s price 
movements, or they may be used to take a single, large buy or sell order and break

it into many smaller orders to try to minimize the price effect of buying or selling a 
large quantity of shares. An increasing amount of trading takes place today “off 
exchange,” often in private trading venues known as “dark pools.” Roughly one￾third of secondary market trading occurs in these off-exchange environments.
Broker Markets If you are like most people, when you think of the “stock 
market,” the first name to come to mind is the New York Stock Exchange, known 
currently as the NYSE Euronext after a series of mergers that expanded the ex￾change’s global reach. In point of fact, the NYSE Euronext is the dominant bro￾ker market. Several regional exchanges are also broker markets. In 2012, the 
NYSE Euronext accounted for a little more than 25 percent of the total dollar 
volume of all shares traded in the U.S. stock market.
Most exchanges are modeled to some degree after the NYSE Euronext. For a 
firm’s securities to be listed for trading on a stock exchange, a firm must file an 
application for listing and meet a number of requirements. For example, to be 
In early 1980, inves￾tors could buy one 
share of Berkshire Hathaway Class A 
common stock (stock symbol: BRKA) for 
$285. That may have seemed expen￾sive at the time, but by May 2013 the 
price of just one share had climbed to 
$169,700. The wizard behind such 
phenomenal growth in shareholder 
value is the chairman of Berkshire Hath￾away, Warren Buffett, nicknamed the 
Oracle of Omaha.
With his partner, Vice-Chairman 
Charlie Munger, Buffett runs a large 
conglomerate of dozens of subsidiaries 
with 288,000 employees and more 
than $162 billion in annual revenues. 
He makes it look easy. In his words, 
“I’ve taken the easy route, just sitting 
back and working through great man￾agers who run their own shows. My 
only tasks are to cheer them on, sculpt 
and harden our corporate culture, and 
make major capital-allocation decisions. 
Our managers have returned this trust 
by working hard and effectively.”a

Berkshire Hathaway: Can Buffett Be Replaced?
to listen to Buffett answer questions 
from shareholders. One question that 
has been firmly answered is that of 
Buffett’s ability to create shareholder 
value.
The next question that needs to 
be answered is whether Berkshire 
Hathaway can successfully replace 
Buffett (age 83) and Munger (age 89). 
In October 2010, Berkshire hired 
hedge fund manager Todd Combs to 
handle a significant portion of the firm’s 
investments. In May 2013, Buffett 
announced that members of Berkshire’s 
board of directors were solidly in 
agreement as to whom the next chief 
executive should be, but he didn’t 
mention any names. Berkshire 
shareholders hope that Buffett’s special 
wisdom applies as well to identifying 
new managerial talent as it does to 
making strategic investment decisions.

never been split. Why might the 
company refuse to split its shares to

behind that “aw-shucks” manner is one 
of the best analytical minds in busi￾ness. He believes in aligning manage￾rial incentives with performance. Berk￾shire employs many different incentive 
arrangements, with their terms depend￾ing on such elements as the economic 
potential or capital intensity of a 
CEO’s business. Whatever the com￾pensation arrangement, Buffett tries to 
keep it both simple and fair. Buffett 
himself receives an annual salary of 
$100,000, which isn’t much in this 
age of supersized CEO compensation 
packages. Listed for many years 
among the world’s wealthiest people, 
Buffett has donated most of his Berk￾shire stock to the Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation.
Berkshire’s annual report is a must￾read for many investors due to the 
popularity of Buffett’s annual letter to 
shareholders with his homespun take 
on such topics as investing, corporate 
governance, and corporate leader￾ship. Shareholder meetings in Omaha, 
Nebraska, have turned into cultlike 
gatherings, with thousands traveling

eligible for listing on the NYSE Euronext, a firm must have at least 400 stock￾holders owning 100 or more shares; a minimum of 1.1 million shares of publicly 
held stock outstanding; pretax earnings of at least $10 million over the previous 
3 years, with at least $2 million in each of the previous 2 years; and a minimum 
market value of public shares of $100 million. Clearly, a firm has to reach a cer￾tain level of success to be listed on the NYSE Euronext.
Once placed, an order to buy or sell on the NYSE Euronext can be executed 
in minutes, thanks to sophisticated telecommunication devices. New Internet￾based brokerage systems enable investors to place their buy and sell orders elec￾tronically. Information on publicly traded securities is reported in various media, 
both print, such as the Wall Street Journal, and electronic, such as MSN Money 
(www.moneycentral.msn.com).
Dealer Markets One of the key features of the dealer market is that it has no 
centralized trading floors. Instead, it is made up of a large number of market 
makers who are linked together via a mass-telecommunications network.
Each market maker is actually a securities dealer who makes a market in one 
or more securities by offering to buy or sell them at stated bid/ask prices. The bid 
price and ask price represent, respectively, the highest price offered to purchase a 
given security and the lowest price at which the security is offered for sale. In ef￾fect, an investor pays the ask price when buying securities and receives the bid 
price when selling them.
As described earlier, the dealer market is made up of both the Nasdaq market
and the over-the-counter (OTC) market, which together account for about 
22 percent of all shares traded in the U.S. market, with the Nasdaq accounting 
for the overwhelming majority of those trades. (As an aside, the primary market
is also a dealer market because all new issues are sold to the investing public by 
securities dealers, acting on behalf of the investment banker.)
The largest dealer market consists of a select group of stocks that are listed and 
traded on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation 
System, typically referred to as Nasdaq. Founded in 1971, Nasdaq had its origins in 
the OTC market but is today considered a totally separate entity that’s no longer a 
part of the OTC market. In fact, in 2006 Nasdaq was formally recognized by the SEC 
as a “listed exchange,” essentially giving it the same stature and prestige as the NYSE.
International Capital Markets

debt and equity markets outside the United States. In the Eurobond market, cor￾porations and governments typically issue bonds denominated in dollars and sell

A
ccording to the World Federation of Exchanges, the largest stock market in the world in 
2012, as measured by the total market value of securities listed on that market, is the NYSE 
Euronext, with listed securities worth more than $14.1 trillion in the United States and $2.8 trillion 
in Europe. The next largest is the Nasdaq at $4.6 trillion, with exchanges in Tokyo and London 
not far behind at $3.5 billion and $3.3 billion respectively.ChAPTER 2   The Financial Market Environment 85
them to investors located outside the United States. A U.S. corporation might, for 
example, issue dollar-denominated bonds that would be purchased by investors 
in Belgium, Germany, or Switzerland. Through the Eurobond market, issuing 
firms and governments can tap a much larger pool of investors than would be 
generally available in the local market.
The foreign bond market is an international market for long-term debt secu￾rities. A foreign bond is a bond issued by a foreign corporation or government 
that is denominated in the investor’s home currency and sold in the investor’s 
home market. A bond issued by a U.S. company that is denominated in Swiss 
francs and sold in Switzerland is a foreign bond. Although the foreign bond mar￾ket is smaller than the Eurobond market, many issuers have found it to be an at￾tractive way of tapping debt markets around the world.
Finally, the international equity market allows corporations to sell blocks of 
shares to investors in a number of different countries simultaneously. This mar￾ket enables corporations to raise far larger amounts of capital than they could in 
any single market. International equity sales have been indispensable to govern￾ments that have sold state-owned companies to private investors.
The Role of Capital Markets
From a firm’s perspective, the role of a capital market is to be a liquid market 
where firms can interact with investors to obtain valuable external financing 
resources. From investors’ perspectives, the role of a capital market is to be an 
efficient market that establishes correct prices for the securities that firms sell and 
allocates funds to their most productive uses. This role is especially true for 
securities that are actively traded in broker or dealer markets, where intense 
competition among investors determines the prices of securities.
The price of an individual security is determined by the interaction between 
buyers and sellers in the market. If the market is efficient, the price of a stock is an 
unbiased estimate of its true value. Investors compete with one another for informa￾tion about a stock’s true value, so at any given time, a stock’s price reflects all the 
information that is known about the stock. Changes in the price reflect new infor￾mation that investors learn about and act on. For example, suppose that a certain 
stock currently trades at $40 per share. If this company announces that sales of a 
new product have been higher than expected, and if investors have not already an￾ticipated that announcement, investors will raise their estimate of what the stock is 
truly worth. At $40, the stock is a relative bargain, so there will temporarily be more 
buyers than sellers wanting to trade the stock, and its price will have to rise to re￾store equilibrium in the market. The more efficient the market is, the more rapidly 
this whole process works. In theory, even information known only to insiders may 
become incorporated in stock prices as the Focus on Ethics box on page 86 explains.
New information is, almost by definition, unpredictable. For example, it is well 
known that retail companies in the United States have a spike in sales near the end of 
the calendar year as the holiday season approaches. When a firm reports higher sales 
near the end of the year, it is not new information because investors in the market are 
aware of the seasonal pattern and anticipate that sales will be higher in the fourth 
quarter than at any other time of year. To the market, new information would be a 
report from a retailer that its sales were higher (or lower) in the fourth quarter than 
investors had already expected. Because it is unanticipated, new information has a 
random quality (that is, sometimes firms announce better-than-expected results, and 
sometimes they announce worse-than-expected results). As new information arrives,

stock prices quickly respond, and those price movements will appear to occur at ran￾dom. Therefore, one sign that a stock market is efficient is that changes in stock 
prices are nearly impossible to predict, even by professional investors.
Not everyone agrees that prices in financial markets are as efficient as described 
in the preceding paragraph. Advocates of behavioral finance, an emerging field that 
blends ideas from finance and psychology, argue that stock prices and prices of 
other securities can deviate from their true values for extended periods and that 
these deviations may lead to predictable patterns in stock prices. These people point 
to episodes such as the huge run-up and subsequent collapse of the prices of Internet 
stocks in the late 1990s and the failure of markets to accurately assess the risk of 
mortgage-backed securities in the more recent financial crisis as examples of the 
principle that stock prices sometimes can be wildly inaccurate measures of value.
Just how efficient are the prices in financial markets? That question will be 
debated for a long time. It is clear that prices do move in response to new informa￾tion, and for most investors and corporate managers, the best advice is probably to 
be cautious when betting against the market. Identifying securities that the market 
has over- or undervalued is extremely difficult, and very few people have demon￾strated an ability to bet against the market correctly for an extended time.
In May 2013, news 
broke of an insider trad￾ing scandal involving the head auditor in 
the Los Angeles office of KPMG, Scott 
London. The U.S. Securities and Ex￾change Commission alleged that London 
passed information to a friend, Bryan 
Shaw, that he had gained while working 
on audits of two companies, Herbalife 
and Skechers. Shaw made $1.3 million 
in trading profits based on London’s in￾side information, and he rewarded Lon￾don with lavish gifts, including envelopes 
full of cash, a Rolex watch, and concert 
tickets. Shaw plead guilty to insider trad￾ing charges on May 20.
Laws prohibiting insider trading 
were established in the United States in 
the 1930s. These laws are designed to 
ensure that all investors have access to 
relevant information on the same terms. 
However, many market participants be￾lieve that insider trading should be per￾mitted. Their argument is rooted in the 
efficient-market hypothesis (EMH). 
According to the EMH, stock prices fully 
reflect all publicly available information. 
Of course, a significant amount of infor￾mation about every company is not 
publicly available. Thus, stock prices 
may not accurately reflect all that is 
known about a company.
Those who argue for allowing in￾sider trading believe that market prices 
influence the allocation of resources 
among companies. Firms with higher 
stock prices find it easier to raise capi￾tal, for example. Therefore, it is impor￾tant that market prices reflect as much 
information as possible. Advocates of 
allowing insider trading argue that in￾vestors would quickly convert inside in￾formation into publicly available infor￾mation if insider trading were permitted. 
If, for example, Scott London had 
learned of problems at one of his audit 
clients and had traded on the basis of 
that information, market participants 
might have viewed his actions and 
concluded that the client’s prospects 
had dimmed. Of course, the other nec￾essary condition is that outsiders can 
observe the stock market transactions of 
insiders.
Interestingly, Eugene Fama, who is 
viewed by many as the father of the ef￾ficient-market hypothesis, does not be￾lieve that insider trading should be 
permitted.a
 Fama believes that allow￾ing insider trading creates a moral 
hazard problem. For example, if insid￾ers are allowed to trade on proprietary 
information, they may have the incen￾tive to hold back information for their 
personal gain.

2.2 The Financial Crisis
In the summer and fall of 2008, the U.S. financial system, and financial systems 
around the world, appeared to be on the verge of collapse. Troubles in the finan￾cial sector spread to other industries, and a severe global recession ensued. In this 
section, we outline some of the main causes and consequences of that crisis.
FINANCIAL INSTITuTIONS ANd REAL ESTATE FINANCE
In the classic film It’s a Wonderful Life, the central character is George Bailey, 
who runs a financial institution called the Bailey Building and Loan Association. 
In a key scene in that movie, a bank run is about to occur, and depositors demand 
that George return the money that they had invested in the Building and Loan. 
George pleads with one man to keep his funds at the bank, saying:
You’re thinking of this place all wrong, as if I have the money back in a safe. The 
money’s not here. Your money is in Joe’s house. That’s right next to yours—and 
then the Kennedy house, and Mrs. Maklin’s house, and a hundred others. You’re 
lending them the money to build, and then they’re going to pay it back to you as 
best they can. What are you going to do, foreclose on them?
This scene offers a relatively realistic portrayal of the role that financial institu￾tions played in allocating credit for investments in residential real estate for many 
years. Local banks took deposits and made loans to local borrowers. However, since 
the 1970s, a process called securitization has changed the way that mortgage finance 
works. Securitization refers to the process of pooling mortgages or other types of loans 
and then selling claims or securities against that pool in a secondary market. These 
securities, called mortgage-backed securities, can be purchased by individual investors, 
pension funds, mutual funds, or virtually any other investor. As homeowners repay 
their loans, those payments eventually make their way into the hands of investors who 
hold the mortgage-backed securities. Therefore, a primary risk associated with mort￾gage-backed securities is that homeowners may not be able to, or may choose not to, 
repay their loans. Banks today still lend money to individuals who want to build or 
purchase new homes, but they typically bundle those loans together and sell them to 
organizations that securitize them and pass them on to investors all over the world.

FALLING hOME PRICES ANd dELINQuENT MORTGAGES
Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, most investors viewed mortgage-backed secu￾rities as relatively safe investments. Figure 2.2 illustrates one of the main rea￾sons for this view. The figure shows the behavior of the Standard & Poor’s 
Case-Shiller Index, a barometer of home prices in ten major U.S. cities, in each 
month from January 1987 to February 2013. Historically, declines in the index 
were relatively infrequent, and between July 1995 and April 2006 the index 
rose continuously without posting even a single monthly decline. When house 
prices are rising, the gap between what a borrower owes on a home and what 
the home is worth widens. Lenders will allow borrowers who have difficulty 
making payments on their mortgages to tap this built-up home equity to refi￾nance their loans and lower their payments. Therefore, rising home prices 
helped keep mortgage default rates low from the mid-1990s through 2006. In￾vesting in real estate and mortgage-backed securities seemed to involve very 
little risk during this period.
In part because real estate investments appeared to be relatively safe, lend￾ers began relaxing their standards for borrowers. This change led to tremen￾dous growth in a category of loans called subprime mortgages. Subprime mort￾gages are mortgage loans made to borrowers with lower incomes and poorer 
credit histories as compared to “prime” borrowers. Loans granted to subprime 
borrowers often have adjustable, rather than fixed, interest rates, which makes 
subprime borrowers particularly vulnerable if interest rates rise. Many of these 
borrowers (and lenders) assumed that rising home prices would allow borrow￾ers to refinance their loans if they had difficulties making payments. Partly

through the growth of subprime mortgages, banks and other financial institu￾tions gradually increased their investments in real estate loans. In 2000, real 
estate loans accounted for less than 40 percent of the total loan portfolios of 
large banks. By 2007, real estate loans grew to more than half of all loans made 
by large banks, and the fraction of these loans in the subprime category in￾creased as well.
Unfortunately, as Figure 2.2 shows, home prices fell almost without 
interruption from May 2006 through May 2009. Over that 3-year period, home 
prices fell on average by more than 30 percent. Not surprisingly, when 
homeowners had difficulty making their mortgage payments, refinancing was no 
longer an option, and delinquency rates and foreclosures began to climb. By 
2009, nearly 25 percent of subprime borrowers were behind schedule on their 
mortgage payments. Some borrowers, recognizing that the value of their homes 
was far less than the amount they owed on their mortgages, simply walked away 
from their homes and let lenders repossess them.
CRISIS OF CONFIdENCE IN BANKS
With delinquency rates rising, the value of mortgage-backed securities began to fall 
and so, too, did the fortunes of financial institutions that had invested heavily in 
real estate assets. In March 2008, the Federal Reserve provided financing for the 
acquisition (that is, the rescue) of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase. Later that year, 
Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. Throughout 2008 and 2009, the Federal 
Reserve, the George W. Bush administration, and finally the administration of 
Barack Obama took unprecedented steps to try to shore up the banking sector and 
stimulate the economy, but these measures could not completely avert the crisis.
Figure 2.3 shows the behavior of the Standard & Poor’s Banking Index, an index 
that tracks bank stocks. Bank stocks fell 81 percent between January 2008 and 
March 2009, and the number of bank failures skyrocketed. According to the FDIC, 
only three banks failed in 2007. In 2008, that number rose by a factor of eight to 25 
failed banks, and the number increased nearly six times to 140 failures in 2009. 
While the economy began to recover in 2010, bank failures continued at a rapid 
pace, with 157 institutions failing that year followed by 92 more failures in 2011.

SPILLOVER EFFECTS ANd ThE GREAT RECESSION
As banks came under intense financial pressure in 2008, they began to tighten 
their lending standards and dramatically reduce the quantity of loans they made. 
In the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, lending in the money mar￾ket contracted very sharply. Corporations that had relied on the money market as 
a source of short-term funding found that they could no longer raise money in 
this market or could do so only at extraordinarily high rates.
As a consequence, businesses began to hoard cash and cut back on expendi￾tures, and economic activity contracted. Gross domestic product (GDP) declined 
in five out of six quarters starting in the first quarter of 2008, and the economy 
shed more than 8 million jobs in 2008–2009 as the unemployment rate reached 
10 percent. Congress passed an $862 billion stimulus package to try to revive the 
economy, and the Federal Reserve pushed short-term interest rates close to 0 per￾cent. Although the economy began to recover in 2009, the recovery was very 
slow. As late as May 2013, total employment was still just 2 percent lower than 
it had been prior to the start of the recession.
Perhaps the most important lesson from this episode is how important finan￾cial institutions are to a modern economy. By some measures, the 2008–2009 
recession was the worst experienced in the United States since the Great Depres￾sion. Indeed, there many parallels between those two economic contractions. 
Both were preceded by a period of rapid economic growth, rising stock prices, 
and movements by banks into new lines of business, and both involved a major 
crisis in the financial sector. Recessions associated with a banking crisis tend to 
be more severe than other recessions because so many businesses rely on credit to 
operate. When financial institutions contract borrowing, activity in most other 
industries slows down too.

2.3 Regulation of Financial Institutions 
and Markets
The previous section discussed just how vulnerable modern economies are when 
financial institutions are in a state of crisis. Partly to avoid these types of prob￾lems, governments typically regulate financial institutions and markets as much 
or more than almost any other sector in the economy. This section provides an 
overview of the financial regulatory landscape in the United States.
LG 5ChAPTER 2   The Financial Market Environment 91
REGuLATIONS GOVERNING FINANCIAL INSTITuTIONS
As mentioned in Section 2.1, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933 dur￾ing the depths of the Great Depression. The early 1930s witnessed a series of 
banking panics that caused almost one-third of the nation’s banks to fail. Trou￾bles within the banking sector and other factors contributed to the worst eco￾nomic contraction in U.S. history, in which industrial production fell by more 
than 50 percent, the unemployment rate peaked at almost 25 percent, and stock 
prices dropped roughly 86 percent. The Glass-Steagall Act attempted to calm the 
public’s fears about the banking industry by establishing the Federal Deposit In￾surance Corporation (FDIC), which provided deposit insurance, effectively guar￾anteeing that individuals would not lose their money if they held it in a bank that 
failed. The FDIC was also charged with examining banks on a regular basis to 
ensure that they were “safe and sound.” The Glass-Steagall Act also prohibited 
institutions that took deposits from engaging in activities such as securities un￾derwriting and trading, thereby effectively separating commercial banks from in￾vestment banks.
Over time, U.S. financial institutions faced competitive pressures from both 
domestic and foreign businesses that engaged in facilitating loans or making 
loans directly. Because these competitors either did not accept deposits or were 
located outside the United States, they were not subject to the same regulations as 
domestic banks. As a result, domestic banks began to lose market share in their 
core businesses. Pressure mounted to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act to enable U.S. 
banks to compete more effectively, and in 1999 Congress enacted and President 
Bill Clinton signed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which allows commercial banks, 
investment banks, and insurance companies to consolidate and compete for busi￾ness in a wider range of activities.
In the aftermath of the recent financial crisis and recession, Congress passed 
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in July 2010. 
In print, the new law runs for hundreds of pages and calls for the creation of sev￾eral new agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the Office 
of Financial Research, and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. The act 
also realigns the duties of several existing agencies and requires existing and new 
agencies to report to Congress regularly. Three years after Dodd-Frank became 
law, the various agencies affected or created by the new law were still writing 
rules specifying how the new law’s provisions would be implemented. Exactly 
how the new legislation will affect financial institutions and markets remains 
unclear.
REGuLATIONS GOVERNING FINANCIAL MARKETS
Two other pieces of legislation were passed during the Great Depression that had 
an enormous effect on the regulation of financial markets. The Securities Act of 
1933 imposed new regulations governing the sale of new securities. That is, the 
1933 act was intended to regulate activity in the primary market in which securi￾ties are initially issued to the public. The act was designed to ensure that the sell￾ers of new securities provided extensive disclosures to the potential buyers of 
those securities.
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulates the secondary trading of 
securities such as stocks and bonds. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 also

created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is the primary 
agency responsible for enforcing federal securities laws. In addition to the one￾time disclosures required of security issuers by the Securities Act of 1933, the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires ongoing disclosure by companies whose 
securities trade in secondary markets. Companies must make a 10-Q filing every 
quarter and a 10-K filing annually. The 10-Q and 10-K forms contain detailed 
information about the financial performance of the firm during the relevant 
period. Today, these forms are available online through the SEC’s website known 
as EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval). The 1934 act 
also imposes limits on the extent to which corporate “insiders,” such as senior 
managers, can trade in their firm’s securities.
Although the type and level of government regulation will always be de￾batable, the idea that we need and, in fact, benefit from some level of govern￾ment regulation of financial institutions and markets is quite reasonable. The 
biggest benefits of government regulation are the resulting trust and confi￾dence in the financial institutions and markets derived by society. Such trust 
and confidence are necessary to ensure society’s participation in the financial 
market environment that nearly individual in one way or another hopes to 
benefit from.

2.4 Business Taxes
Taxes are a fact of life, and businesses, like individuals, must pay taxes on 
income. The income of sole proprietorships and partnerships is taxed as the 
income of the individual owners; corporate income is subject to corporate 
taxes.
Regardless of their legal form, all businesses can earn two types of in￾come, ordinary and capital gains. Under current law, these two types of in￾come are treated differently in the taxation of individuals; they are not treated 
differently for entities subject to corporate taxes. However, frequent amend￾ments are made to the tax code, particularly as economic conditions change 
and when party control of the legislative and executive branches of govern￾ment shifts.
ORdINARY INCOME
The ordinary income of a corporation is income earned through the sale of goods 
or services. Ordinary income in 2012 was taxed subject to the rates depicted in 
the corporate tax rate schedule in Table 2.1.

Webster Manufacturing, Inc., a small manufacturer of kitchen knives, has before￾tax earnings of $250,000. The tax on these earnings can be found by using the 
tax rate schedule in Table 2.1:
 Total taxes due = $22,250 + 30.39 * ($250,000 - $100,000) 4
= $22,250 + 10.39 * $150,0002
= $22,250 + $58,500 = $80,750
From a financial point of view, it is important to understand the difference 
between average and marginal tax rates, the treatment of interest and dividend 
income, and the effects of tax deductibility.
Marginal versus Average Tax Rates
The marginal tax rate represents the rate at which the next dollar of income is 
taxed. In the current corporate tax structure, the marginal tax rate is 15 percent 
if the firm earns less than $50,000. If a firm earns more than $50,000 but less 
than $75,000, the marginal tax rate is 25 percent. As a firm’s income rises, the 
marginal tax rate that it faces changes as shown in Table 2.1. In the example 
above, if Webster Manufacturing’s earnings increase to $250,001, the last $1 in 
income would be taxed at the marginal rate of 39 percent.
The average tax rate paid on the firm’s ordinary income can be calculated by 
dividing its taxes by its taxable income. For most firms, the average tax rate does 
not equal the marginal tax rate because tax rates change with income levels. In 
the example above, Webster Manufacturing’s marginal tax rate is 39 percent, but 
its average tax rate is 32.3 percent ($80,750 , $250,000). For very large corpo￾rations with earnings in the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, the 
average tax rate is very close to the 35 percent marginal rate in the top bracket 
because most of the firm’s income is taxed at that rate.
In most of the business decisions that managers make, it’s the marginal tax 
rate that really matters. To keep matters simple, the examples in this text will use 
a flat 40 percent tax rate. That means that both the average tax rate and the mar￾ginal tax rate equal 40 percent.

Interest and dividend Income
In the process of determining taxable income, any interest received by the corpo￾ration is included as ordinary income. Dividends, on the other hand, are treated 
differently. This different treatment moderates the effect of double taxation,
which occurs when the already once-taxed earnings of a corporation are distrib￾uted as cash dividends to stockholders, who must pay taxes on dividends up to a 
maximum rate of 15 percent. Dividends that the firm receives on common and 
preferred stock held in other corporations are subject to a 70 percent exclusion 
for tax purposes.1
 The dividend exclusion in effect eliminates most of the poten￾tial tax liability from the dividends received by the second and any subsequent 
corporations.
Tax-deductible Expenses
In calculating their taxes, corporations are allowed to deduct operating expenses, 
as well as interest expense. The tax deductibility of these expenses reduces their 
after-tax cost. The following example illustrates the benefit of tax deductibility.
Two companies, Debt Co. and No-Debt Co., both expect in the coming year to 
have earnings before interest and taxes of $200,000. During the year, Debt Co. 
will have to pay $30,000 in interest. No-Debt Co. has no debt and therefore will 
have no interest expense. Calculation of the earnings after taxes for these two 
firms is as follows:
Example 2.3 ▶ 
1. The 70 percent exclusion applies if the firm receiving dividends owns less than 20 percent of the shares of the firm 
paying the dividends. The exclusion is 80 percent if the corporation owns between 20 percent and 80 percent of the 
stock in the corporation paying it dividends; 100 percent of the dividends received are excluded if it owns more than 
80 percent of the corporation paying it dividends. For convenience, we are assuming here that the ownership interest 
in the dividend-paying corporation is less than 20 percent.
double taxation
Situation that occurs when 
after-tax corporate earnings 
are distributed as cash 
dividends to stockholders, who 
then must pay personal taxes 
on the dividend amount.
Debt Co. No-Debt Co.
Earnings before interest and taxes $200,000 $200,000
Less: Interest expense 30,000 0
Earnings before taxes $170,000 $200,000
Less: Taxes (40%) 68,000 80,000
Earnings after taxes $102,000 $120,000
Difference in earnings after taxes
¯˚˚˚˚˚˚˘˚˚˚˚˚˚˚˙
$18,000
Debt Co. had $30,000 more interest expense than No-Debt Co., but Debt Co.’s 
earnings after taxes are only $18,000 less than those of No-Debt Co. This 
difference is attributable to Debt Co.’s $30,000 interest expense deduction 
providing a tax savings of $12,000 ($68,000 for Debt Co. versus $80,000 for 
No-Debt Co.). This amount can be calculated directly by multiplying the tax 
rate by the amount of interest expense (0.40 * $30,000 = $12,000). Similarly, 
the $18,000 after-tax cost of the interest expense can be calculated directly by 
multiplying 1 minus the tax rate by the amount of interest expense 
311 - 0.402 * $30,000 = $18,0004.

The tax deductibility of expenses reduces their actual (after-tax) cost to the 
firm as long as the firm is profitable. If a firm experiences a net loss in a given 
year, its tax liability is already zero. Even in this case, losses in one year can be 
used to offset taxes paid on profits in prior years, and in some cases losses can be 
“carried forward” to offset income and lower taxes in subsequent years. Note 
that both for accounting and tax purposes interest is a tax-deductible expense, 
whereas dividends are not. Because dividends are not tax deductible, their after￾tax cost is equal to the amount of the dividend. Thus, a $30,000 cash dividend 
has an after-tax cost of $30,000.
CAPITAL GAINS
If a firm sells a capital asset (such as stock held as an investment) for more than it 
paid for the asset, the difference between the sale price and purchase price is 
called a capital gain. For corporations, capital gains are added to ordinary corpo￾rate income and taxed at the regular corporate rates.
Ross Company, a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, has pretax operating 
earnings of $500,000 and has just sold for $150,000 an asset that was purchased 
2 years ago for $125,000. Because the asset was sold for more than its initial 
purchase price, there is a capital gain of $25,000 ($150,000 sale price - 
$125,000 initial purchase price). The corporation’s taxable income will total 
$525,000 ($500,000 ordinary income plus $25,000 capital gain). Multiplying its 
taxable income by 40% produces Ross Company’s tax liability of $210,000.

Summary
ThE ROLE OF FINANCIAL INSTITuTIONS ANd MARKETS
This chapter described why financial institutions and markets are an integral part 
of managerial finance. Companies cannot get started or survive without raising 
capital, and financial institutions and markets give firms access to the money they 
need to grow. As we have seen in recent years, however, financial markets can be 
quite turbulent, and when large financial institutions get into trouble, access to 
capital is reduced and firms throughout the economy suffer as a result. Taxes are 
an important part of this story as well because the rules governing how business 
income is taxed shape the incentives of firms to make new investments.96 PART 1   Introduction to Managerial Finance
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
LG 1 Understand the role that financial institutions play in managerial finance.
Financial institutions bring net suppliers of funds and net demanders together to 
help translate the savings of individuals, businesses, and governments into loans 
and other types of investments. The net suppliers of funds are generally individu￾als or households who save more money than they borrow. Businesses and gov￾ernments are generally net demanders of funds, meaning that they borrow more 
money than they save.
LG 2 Contrast the functions of financial institutions and financial markets.
Both financial institutions and financial markets help businesses raise the money 
that they need to fund new investments for growth. Financial institutions collect 
the savings of individuals and channel those funds to borrowers such as busi￾nesses and governments. Financial markets provide a forum in which savers and 
borrowers can transact business directly. Businesses and governments issue debt 
and equity securities directly to the public in the primary market. Subsequent 
trading of these securities between investors occurs in the secondary market.
LG 3 Describe the differences between the capital markets and the money mar￾kets. In the money market, savers who want a temporary place to deposit funds 
where they can earn interest interact with borrowers who have a short-term 
need for funds. Marketable securities, including Treasury bills, commercial pa￾per, and other instruments, are the primary securities traded in the money mar￾ket. The Eurocurrency market is the international equivalent of the domestic 
money market.
In contrast, the capital market is the forum in which savers and borrowers 
interact on a long-term basis. Firms issue either debt (bonds) or equity (stock) 
securities in the capital market. Once issued, these securities trade on secondary 
markets that are either broker markets or dealer markets. An important function 
of the capital market is to determine the underlying value of the securities issued 
by businesses. In an efficient market, the price of a security is an unbiased esti￾mate of its true value.
LG 4 Explain the root causes of the 2008 financial crisis and recession. The fi￾nancial crisis was caused by several factors related to investments in real estate. 
Financial institutions lowered their standards for lending to prospective home￾owners, and institutions also invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities. 
When home prices fell and mortgage delinquencies rose, the value of the mort￾gage-backed securities held by banks plummeted, causing some banks to fail and 
many others to restrict the flow of credit to business. That, in turn, contributed 
to a severe recession in the United States and abroad.
LG 5 Understand the major regulations and regulatory bodies that affect financial 
institutions and markets. The Glass-Steagall Act created the FDIC and imposed a 
separation between commercial and investment banks. The act was designed to 
limit the risks that banks could take and to protect depositors. More recently, the 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act essentially repealed the elements of Glass-Steagall pertain￾ing to the separation of commercial and investment banks. After the recent ChAPTER 2   The Financial Market Environment 97
financial crisis, much debate has occurred regarding the proper regulation of large 
financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act was passed in 2010 and contained a 
host of new regulatory requirements, the effects of which are yet to be determined.
The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are the 
major pieces of legislation shaping the regulation of financial markets. The 1933 
act focuses on regulating the sale of securities in the primary market, whereas 
the 1934 act deals with regulations governing transactions in the secondary 
market. The 1934 act also created the Securities and Exchange Commission, the 
primary body responsible for enforcing federal securities laws.
LG 6 Discuss business taxes and their importance in financial decisions. Corpo￾rate income is subject to corporate taxes. Corporate tax rates apply to both or￾dinary income (after deduction of allowable expenses) and capital gains. The av￾erage tax rate paid by a corporation ranges from 15 to 35 percent. Corporate 
taxpayers can reduce their taxes through certain provisions in the tax code: divi￾dend income exclusions and tax-deductible expenses. A capital gain occurs when 
an asset is sold for more than its initial purchase price; gains are added to ordi￾nary corporate income and taxed at regular corporate tax rates. (For conve￾nience, we assume a 40 percent marginal tax rate throughout.)
Opener-in-Review
In the chapter opener, you read about the steep decline in home prices in Phoe￾nix. Starting in August 2011, home prices there began to rebound. Consider a 
buyer who purchased a home in Phoenix that month for $150,000, using 
$30,000 of her own funds as a down payment and borrowing the remaining 
$120,000 from a bank via a 30-year mortgage. Two years later, prices in Phoe￾nix rose by 30 percent, and the house was then worth $195,000. Assuming that 
after making 2 years of payments on the 30-year mortgage, the outstanding 
mortgage balance was still $118,000. How much equity does the buyer have in 
her home? What rate of return has she earned on her initial $30,000 investment?

Merit Enterprise Corp.
S
ara Lehn, chief financial officer of Merit Enterprise Corp., was reviewing her 
presentation one last time before her upcoming meeting with the board of direc￾tors. Merit’s business had been brisk for the last 2 years, and the company’s CEO 
was pushing for a dramatic expansion of Merit’s production capacity. Executing the 
CEO’s plans would require $4 billion in capital in addition to $2 billion in excess 
cash that the firm had built up. Sara’s immediate task was to brief the board on op￾tions for raising the needed $4 billion.
Unlike most companies its size, Merit had maintained its status as a private 
company, financing its growth by reinvesting profits and, when necessary, borrowing 
from banks. Whether Merit could follow that same strategy to raise the $4 billion 
necessary to expand at the pace envisioned by the firm’s CEO was uncertain, 
although it seemed unlikely to Sara. She had identified the following two options for 
the board to consider.
Option 1: Merit could approach JPMorgan Chase, a bank that had served Merit 
well for many years with seasonal credit lines as well as medium-term loans. Lehn 
believed that JPMorgan was unlikely to make a $4 billion loan to Merit on its own, 
but it could probably gather a group of banks together to make a loan of this magni￾tude. However, the banks would undoubtedly demand that Merit limit further bor￾rowing and provide JPMorgan with periodic financial disclosures so that it could 
monitor Merit’s financial condition as Merit expanded its operations.
Option 2: Merit could convert to public ownership, issuing stock to the public 
in the primary market. With Merit’s excellent financial performance in recent years, 
Sara thought that its stock could command a high price in the market and that many 
investors would want to participate in any stock offering that Merit conducted.
Becoming a public company would also allow Merit, for the first time, to offer 
employees compensation in the form of stock or stock options, thereby creating 
stronger incentives for employees to help the firm succeed. On the other hand, Sara 
knew that public companies faced extensive disclosure requirements and other regu￾lations that Merit had never had to confront as a private firm. Furthermore, with 
stock trading in the secondary market, who knew what kind of individuals or insti￾tutions might wind up holding a large chunk of Merit stock?

a. Discuss the pros and cons of option 1, and prioritize your thoughts. What are the 
most positive aspects of this option, and what are the biggest drawbacks?

n this part, you will learn about some of the basic analytical tools that financial 
managers use almost every day. Chapter 3 reviews the main financial 
statements that are the primary means by which firms communicate with investors, 
analysts, and the rest of the business community. It also illustrates some simple 
tools that managers use to analyze the information contained in financial 
statements to identify and diagnose financial problems.
Firms create financial statements using the accrual principles of accounting; in 
finance, though, it is cash flow that really matters. Chapter 4 shows how to use 
financial statements to determine how much cash flow a firm is generating and 
how it is spending that cash flow. It also explains how firms develop short-term 
and long-term financial plans.
Managers have to decide whether the up-front costs of investments are justified 
by the subsequent cash that those investments are likely to produce. Chapter 5 
illustrates techniques that firms use to evaluate these sorts of trade-offs.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
Accounting You need to understand the stockholders’ report and preparation 
of the four key financial statements, how firms consolidate international financial 
statements, and how to calculate and interpret financial ratios for decision making.
informAtion SYStemS You need to understand what data are included in the 
firm’s financial statements so as to design systems that will supply such data to 
those who prepare the statements and to those in the firm who use the data for 
ratio calculations.
mAnAgement You need to understand what parties are interested in the 
stockholders’ report and why, how the financial statements will be analyzed by 
those both inside and outside the firm to assess various aspects of performance, 
the caution that should be exercised in using financial ratio analysis, and how the 
financial statements affect the value of the firm.
mArketing You need to understand the effects your decisions will have on the 
financial statements, particularly the income statement and the statement of cash 
flows, and how analysis of ratios, especially those involving sales figures, will affect 
the firm’s decisions about levels of inventory, credit policies, and pricing decisions.
operAtionS You need to understand how the costs of operations are reflected 
in the firm’s financial statements and how analysis of ratios—particularly those 
involving assets, cost of goods sold, or inventory—may affect requests for new 
equipment or facilities.
In your personal life A routine step in personal financial planning is 
to prepare and analyze personal financial 
statements so that you can monitor progress toward your financial goals. Also, to 
build and monitor your investment portfolio, you need to understand and analyze 
corporate financial statements.Ratios Tell the Story of a 
Well-Managed Firm
T
he stock of defense contractor General Dynamics 
(GD) reached a 52-week high on May 14, 
2013. An article published by the investment research 
web site Zacks.com sought to explain why the compa￾ny’s stock was performing so well. To tell that story, 
Zacks turned to an analysis of several of the firm’s key 
financial ratios.
For example, Zacks observed that GD managed 
to turn its inventory 9.6 times per year compared with just 2.8 for the typical firm in that industry. 
Faster inventory turnover means that the company has more cash to invest in other types of assets or 
to return to shareholders. The report praised GD for a strong liquidity position as evidenced by the 
firm’s current ratio of 1.39, which was also above the industry average. A high current ratio 
suggests that the firm should have no problem paying any bills that come due in the short term. The 
report went on to praise GD for the high rate of return it earned on its assets and the relatively low 
level of debt on its balance sheet.
Financial statements contain a wealth of information, but digesting that information is not 
easy. One way analysts put financial data into perspective is by calculating a variety of financial 
ratios. These ratios help give analysts an idea of how a firm is performing, not only in an absolute 
sense, but also relative to its peers and its competitors. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use 
financial ratios to assess how well a firm is performing.

independent audit reports. The expectation is that it will instill confidence in 
investors with regard to the accuracy of the audited financial statements of 
public companies.
Publicly owned corporations with more than $5 million in assets and 500 or 
more stockholders are required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC)—the federal regulatory body that governs the sale and listing of securities—
to provide their stockholders with an annual stockholders’ report. The stockhold￾ers’ report summarizes and documents the firm’s financial activities during the 
past year. It begins with a letter to the stockholders from the firm’s chief executive 
officer or chairman of the board.
ThE LETTER TO STOCKhOLdERS
The letter to stockholders is the primary communication from management. 
It describes the events that are considered to have had the greatest effect on 
the firm during the year. It also typically discusses management philosophy,

In the United States, 
public companies are 
required to report financial results using 
GAAP. However, accounting standards 
vary around the world, and that makes 
comparing the financial results of firms lo￾cated in different countries quite challeng￾ing. In recent years, many countries have 
adopted a system of accounting princi￾ples known as International Financial Re￾porting Standards (IFRS), which are estab￾lished by an independent standards￾setting body known as the International 
Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
These standards are designed with the 
goal of making financial statements every￾where understandable, reliable, compara￾ble, and accurate. More than 80 coun￾tries now require listed firms to comply 
with IFRS, and dozens more permit or re￾quire firms to follow IFRS to some degree.
Why hasn’t the United States fol￾lowed the global trend of IFRS adoption? 
Some argue that GAAP is still the “gold 
standard” and that a movement to IFRS 
would lower the overall quality of 
financial reporting made by U.S. firms. It 
is true that IFRS generally requires less 
detail than GAAP. Even so, the Securities 
and Exchange Commission has ex￾pressed its view that U.S. investors will 
benefit as GAAP and IFRS converge, al￾though there is no expectation that firms 
in the United States will be required to 
switch to IFRS in the near future.

ThE FOuR KEY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The four key financial statements required by the SEC for reporting to sharehold￾ers are (1) the income statement, (2) the balance sheet, (3) the statement of stock￾holders’ equity, and (4) the statement of cash flows. The financial statements 
from the 2015 stockholders’ report of Bartlett Company, a manufacturer of metal 
fasteners, are presented and briefly discussed in this section. Most likely, you 
have studied these four financial statements in an accounting course, so the pur￾pose of looking at them here is to refresh your memory of the basics rather than 
provide an exhaustive review.
Income Statement
The income statement provides a financial summary of the firm’s operating 
results during a specified period. Most common are income statements cover￾ing a 1-year period ending at a specified date, ordinarily December 31 of the 
calendar year.
letter to stockholders
Typically, the first element of the 
annual stockholders’ report and 
the primary communication 
from management.
income statement
Provides a financial summary 
of the firm’s operating results 
during a specified period.
Near the end of each 
quarter, Wall Street’s 
much anticipated “earnings season” ar￾rives. During earnings season, many 
companies unveil their quarterly perfor￾mance. Interest is high, as media outlets 
rush to report the latest announcements, 
analysts slice and dice the numbers, 
and investors buy and sell based on the 
news. The most anticipated perfor￾mance metric for most companies is 
earnings per share (EPS), which is typi￾cally compared to the estimates of the 
analysts who cover a firm. Firms that 
beat analyst estimates often see their 
share prices jump, whereas those that 
miss estimates, by even a small amount, 
tend to suffer price declines.
Many investors are aware of the pit￾falls of judging firms based on reported 
earnings. Specifically, the complexity of 
financial reports makes it easy for man￾agers to mislead investors. Sometimes, 
the methods used to mislead investors 
are within the rules, albeit not the spirit, 
of acceptable accounting practices. 
Other times, firms break the rules to 
make their numbers. The practice of ma￾nipulating earnings to mislead investors 
is known as earnings management.
Some firms are notorious for consis￾tently beating analysts’ estimates. For 
example, for one 10-year period 
(1995–2004), General Electric Co. 
(GE) beat Wall Street earnings esti￾mates every quarter, often by only a 
penny or two per share. However, in 
2009, the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) fined GE $50 mil￾lion for improper accounting practices, 
including recording sales that had not 
yet occurred. When GE went back to 
correct the problems identified by the 
SEC, it found that net earnings between 
2001 and 2007 were a total of $280 
million lower than originally reported.
In one of his famous letters to the 
shareholders of Berskshire Hathaway, 
Warren Buffett offers three bits of ad￾vice regarding financial reporting.a
First, he warns that weak visible ac￾counting practices are typically a sign 
of bigger problems. Second, he sug￾gests that, when you can’t understand 
management, the reason is probably 
that management doesn’t want you to 
understand them. Third, he warns that 
investors should be suspicious of projec￾tions because earnings and growth do 
not typically progress in an orderly fash￾ion. Finally, Buffett notes that “Manag￾ers that always promise to ‘make the 
numbers’ will at some point be tempted 
to make up the numbers.”

Many large firms, however, operate on a 12-month financial cycle, or fis￾cal year, that ends at a time other than December 31. In addition, monthly 
income statements are typically prepared for use by management, and quar￾terly statements must be made available to the stockholders of publicly owned 
corporations.
Table 3.1 presents Bartlett Company’s income statements for the years ended 
December 31, 2015 and 2014. The 2015 statement begins with sales revenue—
the total dollar amount of sales during the period—from which the cost of goods 
sold is deducted. The resulting gross profit of $986,000 represents the amount 
remaining to satisfy operating, financial, and tax costs. Next, operating 
expenses—which include selling expense, general and administrative expense, 
lease expense, and depreciation expense—are deducted from gross profits. The 
resulting operating profits of $418,000 represent the profits earned from produc￾ing and selling products; this amount does not consider financial and tax costs. 
(Operating profit is often called earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT.) 
Next, the financial cost—interest expense—is subtracted from operating profits

to find net profits (or earnings) before taxes. After subtracting $93,000 in 2015 
interest, Bartlett Company had $325,000 of net profits before taxes.
Next, taxes are calculated at the appropriate tax rates and deducted to deter￾mine net profits (or earnings) after taxes, also referred to as net income. Bartlett 
Company’s net profits after taxes for 2015 were $231,000. Any preferred stock 
dividends must be subtracted from net profits after taxes to arrive at earnings 
available for common stockholders, which is the amount earned by the firm on 
behalf of the common stockholders during the period.
Dividing earnings available for common stockholders by the number of shares 
of common stock outstanding results in earnings per share (EPS). EPS represent the 
number of dollars earned during the period on behalf of each outstanding share of 
common stock. In 2015, Bartlett Company earned $221,000 for its common stock￾holders, which represents $2.90 for each outstanding share. The actual cash divi￾dend per share (DPS), which is the dollar amount of cash distributed during the pe￾riod on behalf of each outstanding share of common stock, paid in 2015 was $1.29.

Balance Sheet
The balance sheet presents a summary statement of the firm’s financial position 
at a given time. The statement balances the firm’s assets (what it owns) against its 
financing, which can be either debt (what it owes) or equity (what was provided 
by owners). Bartlett Company’s balance sheets as of December 31 of 2015 and 
2014 are presented in Table 3.2. They show a variety of asset, liability (debt), and 
equity accounts.
An important distinction is made between short-term and long-term assets 
and liabilities. The current assets and current liabilities are short-term assets and 
liabilities, which means that they are expected to be converted into cash (current 
assets) or paid (current liabilities) within 1 year or less. All other assets and liabil￾ities, along with stockholders’ equity, which is assumed to have an infinite life, 
are considered long-term, or fixed, because they are expected to remain on the 
firm’s books for more than 1 year.
As is customary, the assets are listed from the most liquid—cash—down to 
the least liquid. Marketable securities are very liquid short-term investments, 
such as U.S. Treasury bills or certificates of deposit, held by the firm. Because 
they are highly liquid, marketable securities are viewed as a form of cash (“near 
cash”). Accounts receivable represent the total monies owed the firm by its cus￾tomers on credit sales. Inventories include raw materials, work in process (par￾tially finished goods), and finished goods held by the firm. The entry for gross 
fixed assets is the original cost of all fixed (long-term) assets owned by the firm.1
Net fixed assets represent the difference between gross fixed assets and accumu￾lated depreciation, the total expense recorded for the depreciation of fixed assets. 
The net value of fixed assets is called their book value.
Like assets, the liabilities and equity accounts are listed from short-term to 
long-term. Current liabilities include accounts payable, amounts owed for credit 
purchases by the firm; notes payable, outstanding short-term loans, typically 
from commercial banks; and accruals, amounts owed for services for which a bill 
may not or will not be received. Examples of accruals include taxes due the gov￾ernment and wages due employees. Long-term debt represents debt for which 
payment is not due in the current year. Stockholders’ equity represents the own￾ers’ claims on the firm. The preferred stock entry shows the historical proceeds 
from the sale of preferred stock ($200,000 for Bartlett Company).
Next, the amount paid by the original purchasers of common stock is shown 
by two entries, common stock and paid-in capital in excess of par on common 
stock. The common stock entry is the par value of common stock. Paid-in capital 
in excess of par represents the amount of proceeds in excess of the par value re￾ceived from the original sale of common stock. The sum of the common stock 
and paid-in capital accounts divided by the number of shares outstanding repre￾sents the original price per share received by the firm on a single issue of common 
stock.

common stock.
Finally, retained earnings represent the cumulative total of all earnings, net of 
dividends, that have been retained and reinvested in the firm since its inception. It 
is important to recognize that retained earnings are not cash but rather have been 
used to finance the firm’s assets.
Bartlett Company’s balance sheets in Table 3.2 show that the firm’s total as￾sets increased from $3,270,000 in 2014 to $3,597,000 in 2015. The $327,000 
increase was due primarily to the $219,000 increase in current assets. The asset 
increase, in turn, appears to have been financed primarily by an increase of 
$193,000 in total liabilities. Better insight into these changes can be derived from 
the statement of cash flows, which we will discuss shortly.

Statement of Retained Earnings
The statement of retained earnings is an abbreviated form of the statement of 
stockholders’ equity. Unlike the statement of stockholders’ equity, which shows 
all equity account transactions that occurred during a given year, the statement of 
retained earnings reconciles the net income earned during a given year, and any

cash dividends paid, with the change in retained earnings between the start and 
the end of that year. Table 3.3 presents this statement for Bartlett Company for 
the year ended December 31, 2015. The statement shows that the company be￾gan the year with $1,012,000 in retained earnings and had net profits after taxes 
of $231,000, from which it paid a total of $108,000 in dividends, resulting in 
year-end retained earnings of $1,135,000. Thus, the net increase for Bartlett 
Company was $123,000 ($231,000 net profits after taxes minus $108,000 in 
dividends) during 2015.
Statement of Cash Flows
The statement of cash flows is a summary of the cash flows over the period of 
concern. The statement provides insight into the firm’s operating, investment, 
and financing cash flows and reconciles them with changes in its cash and mar￾ketable securities during the period. Bartlett Company’s statement of cash flows 
for the year ended December 31, 2015, is presented in Table 3.4 (see page 114).
Further insight into this statement is included in the discussion of cash flow in 
Chapter 4.
NOTES TO ThE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Included with published financial statements are explanatory notes keyed to the 
relevant accounts in the statements. These notes to the financial statements pro￾vide detailed information on the accounting policies, procedures, calculations, 
and transactions underlying entries in the financial statements. Common issues 
addressed by these notes include revenue recognition, income taxes, breakdowns 
of fixed asset accounts, debt and lease terms, and contingencies. Since passage of 
Sarbanes-Oxley, notes to the financial statements have also included some details 
about compliance with that law. Professional securities analysts use the data in 
the statements and notes to develop estimates of the value of securities that the 
firm issues, and these estimates influence the actions of investors and therefore 
the firm’s share value.

The current policy is described in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) 
Standard No. 52, which mandates that U.S.–based companies translate their 
foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars for con￾solidation with the parent company’s financial statements. This process is done 
by using a technique called the current rate (translation) method, under which 
all a U.S. parent company’s foreign-currency-denominated assets and liabilities 
are converted into dollar values using the exchange rate prevailing at the fiscal 
year ending date (the current rate). Income statement items are treated simi￾larly. Equity accounts, on the other hand, are translated into dollars by using 
the exchange rate that prevailed when the parent’s equity investment was made 
(the historical rate). Retained earnings are adjusted to reflect each year’s oper￾ating profits or losses.

3.2 using Financial Ratios
The information contained in the four basic financial statements is of major sig￾nificance to a variety of interested parties who regularly need to have relative 
measures of the company’s performance. Relative is the key word here, because 
the analysis of financial statements is based on the use of ratios or relative values.
Ratio analysis involves methods of calculating and interpreting financial ratios to 
analyze and monitor the firm’s performance. The basic inputs to ratio analysis 
are the firm’s income statement and balance sheet.
INTERESTEd PARTIES
Ratio analysis of a firm’s financial statements is of interest to shareholders, credi￾tors, and the firm’s own management. Both current and prospective shareholders 
are interested in the firm’s current and future level of risk and return, which directly 
affect share price. The firm’s creditors are interested primarily in the short-term li￾quidity of the company and its ability to make interest and principal payments. A 
secondary concern of creditors is the firm’s profitability; they want assurance that 
the business is healthy. Management, like stockholders, is concerned with all as￾pects of the firm’s financial situation, and it attempts to produce financial ratios 
that will be considered favorable by both owners and creditors. In addition, man￾agement uses ratios to monitor the firm’s performance from period to period.
TYPES OF RATIO COMPARISONS
Ratio analysis is not merely the calculation of a given ratio. More important is 
the interpretation of the ratio value. A meaningful basis for comparison is needed 
to answer such questions as “Is it too high or too low?” and “Is it good or bad?” 
Both cross-sectional and time-series ratio comparisons can be made.
Cross-Sectional Analysis
Cross-sectional analysis involves the comparison of different firms’ financial ra￾tios at the same point in time. Analysts are often interested in how well a firm 
has performed in relation to other firms in its industry. Frequently, a firm will 
compare its ratio values with those of a key competitor or with a group of com￾petitors that it wishes to emulate. This type of cross-sectional analysis, called 
benchmarking, has become very popular.
Comparison to industry averages is also popular. These figures can be found

Analysts have to be very careful when drawing conclusions from ratio com￾parisons. It’s tempting to assume that if one ratio for a particular firm is above the 
industry norm, it is a sign that the firm is performing well, at least along the di￾mension measured by that ratio. However, ratios may be above or below the in￾dustry norm for both positive and negative reasons, and it is necessary to deter￾mine why a firm’s performance differs from its industry peers. Thus, ratio analysis 
on its own is probably most useful in highlighting areas for further investigation.
Inventory Turnover, 2015

Industry average 9.7
In early 2016, Mary Boyle, the chief financial analyst at Caldwell Manufacturing, 
a producer of heat exchangers, gathered data on the firm’s financial performance 
during 2015, the year just ended. She calculated a variety of ratios and obtained 
industry averages. She was especially interested in inventory turnover, which re￾flects the speed with which the firm moves its inventory from raw materials 
through production into finished goods and to the customer as a completed sale. 
Generally, higher values of this ratio are preferred because they indicate a quicker 
turnover of inventory and more efficient inventory management. Caldwell Manu￾facturing’s calculated inventory turnover for 2015 and the industry average in￾ventory turnover were as follows:

Mary’s initial reaction to these data was that the firm had managed its inven￾tory significantly better than the average firm in the industry. The turnover was 
nearly 53% faster than the industry average. On reflection, however, she realized 
that a very high inventory turnover could be a sign that the firm is not holding 
enough inventories. The consequence of low inventory could be excessive stock￾outs (insufficient inventory to meet customer needs). Discussions with people in 
the manufacturing and marketing departments did, in fact, uncover such a prob￾lem: Inventories during the year were extremely low, resulting in numerous pro￾duction delays that hindered the firm’s ability to meet demand and resulted in 
disgruntled customers and lost sales. A ratio that initially appeared to reflect ex￾tremely efficient inventory management was actually the symptom of a major 
problem.
Time-Series Analysis
Time-series analysis evaluates performance over time. Comparison of current to 
past performance, using ratios, enables analysts to assess the firm’s progress. De￾veloping trends can be seen by using multiyear comparisons. Any significant 
year-to-year changes may be symptomatic of a problem, especially if the same 
trend is not an industry-wide phenomenon.
Combined Analysis
The most informative approach to ratio analysis combines cross-sectional and 
time-series analyses. A combined view makes it possible to assess the trend in the 
behavior of the ratio in relation to the trend for the industry. Figure 3.1 depicts 
this type of approach using the average collection period ratio of Bartlett Com￾pany over the years 2012–2015. This ratio reflects the average amount of time 
(in days) it takes the firm to collect bills, and lower values of this ratio generally 
are preferred. The figure quickly discloses that (1) Bartlett’s effectiveness in col￾lecting its receivables is poor in comparison to the industry, and (2) Bartlett’s 
trend is toward longer collection periods. Clearly, Bartlett needs to shorten its 
collection period.

CAuTIONS ABOuT uSING RATIO ANALYSIS
Before discussing specific ratios, we should consider the following cautions about 
their use:
 1. Ratios that reveal large deviations from the norm merely indicate the possi￾bility of a problem. Additional analysis is typically needed to determine 
whether there is a problem and to isolate the causes of the problem.
 2. A single ratio does not generally provide sufficient information from which 
to judge the overall performance of the firm. However, if an analysis is con￾cerned only with certain specific aspects of a firm’s financial position, one or 
two ratios may suffice.
 3. The ratios being compared should be calculated using financial statements 
dated at the same point in time during the year. If they are not, the effects of 
seasonality may produce erroneous conclusions and decisions.
 4. It is preferable to use audited financial statements for ratio analysis. If they 
have not been audited, the data in them may not reflect the firm’s true finan￾cial condition.
 5. The financial data being compared should have been developed in the same 
way. The use of differing accounting treatments—especially relative to inven￾tory and depreciation—can distort the results of ratio comparisons, regard￾less of whether cross-sectional or time-series analysis is used.
 6. Results can be distorted by inflation, which can cause the book values of inven￾tory and depreciable assets to differ greatly from their replacement values. Ad￾ditionally, inventory costs and depreciation write-offs can differ from their true 
values, thereby distorting profits. Without adjustment, inflation tends to cause 
older firms (older assets) to appear more efficient and profitable than newer firms 
(newer assets). Clearly, in using ratios, you must be careful when comparing 
older with newer firms or comparing a firm to itself over a long period of time.
CATEGORIES OF FINANCIAL RATIOS
Financial ratios can be divided for convenience into five general categories: li￾quidity, activity, debt, profitability, and market ratios. Liquidity, activity, and 
debt ratios primarily measure risk. Profitability ratios measure return. Market 
ratios capture both risk and return.
As a rule, the inputs necessary for an effective financial analysis include, at a 
minimum, the income statement and the balance sheet. We will use the 2015 and 
2014 income statements and balance sheets for Bartlett Company, presented ear￾lier in Tables 3.1 and 3.2, to demonstrate ratio calculations. Note, however, that 
the ratios presented in the remainder of this chapter can be applied to almost any 
company. Of course, many companies in different industries use ratios that focus 
on aspects peculiar to their industry.

3.3 Liquidity Ratios
The liquidity of a firm is measured by its ability to satisfy its short-term obligations as 
they come due. Liquidity refers to the solvency of the firm’s overall financial position, 
or the ease with which it can pay its bills. Because a common precursor to financial 
distress and bankruptcy is low or declining liquidity, these ratios can provide early 
signs of cash flow problems and impending business failure. Clearly, it is desirable 
that a firm is able to pay its bills, so having enough liquidity for day-to-day opera￾tions is important. However, liquid assets, like cash held at banks and marketable 
securities, do not earn a particularly high rate of return, so shareholders will not want 
a firm to overinvest in liquidity. Firms have to balance the need for safety that liquid￾ity provides against the low returns that liquid assets generate for investors. The two 
basic measures of liquidity are the current ratio and the quick (acid-test) ratio.
CuRRENT RATIO
The current ratio, one of the most commonly cited financial ratios, measures the 
firm’s ability to meet its short-term obligations. It is expressed as
LG 3

G
lance back at the first column of data in Table 3.5 which shows the current ratio for a vari￾ety of companies and industries. Notice that the industry with the highest current ratio (that 
is, most liquidity) is building materials, a business that is notoriously sensitive to business cycle 
swings. The current ratio for that industry is 2.8, indicating that the typical firm in that business has 
almost three times as much in current assets as in current liabilities. Two of the largest competitors 
in that industry, The Home Depot and Lowe’s, operate with a current ratio of 1.3, less than half the 
industry average. Does this ratio mean that these firms have a liquidity problem? Not necessarily. 
Large enterprises generally have well-established relationships with banks that can provide lines of 
credit and other short-term loan products in the event that the firm has a need for liquidity. Smaller 
firms may not have the same access to credit and therefore tend to operate with more liquidity.
Determinants of Liquidity Needs
The current ratio for Bartlett Company in 2015 is
$1,223,000 4 $620,000 5 1.97
A higher current ratio indicates a greater degree of liquidity. How much liquidity 
a firm needs depends on a variety of factors, including the firm’s size, its access to 
short-term financing sources like bank credit lines, and the volatility of its business. 
For example, a grocery store whose revenues are relatively predictable may not need 
as much liquidity as a manufacturing firm who faces sudden and unexpected shifts in 
demand for its products. The more predictable a firm’s cash flows, the lower the ac￾ceptable current ratio. Because Bartlett Company is in a business with a relatively 
predictable annual cash flow, its current ratio of 1.97 should be quite acceptable.120 PART 2   Financial Tools
Individuals, like corporations, can use financial ratios to ana￾lyze and monitor their performance. Typically, personal fi￾nance ratios are calculated using the personal income and expense statement and 
personal balance sheet for the period of concern. Here we use these statements, 
presented in the preceding personal finance examples, to demonstrate calculation 
of Jan and Jon Smith’s liquidity ratio for calendar year 2015.
The personal liquidity ratio is calculated by dividing total liquid assets by total 
current debt. It indicates the percent of annual debt obligations that an individual 
can meet using current liquid assets. The Smiths’ total liquid assets were $2,225. 
Their total current debts are $21,539 (total current liabilities of $905 1 mortgage 
payments of $16,864 1 auto loan payments of $2,520 1 appliance and furniture 
payments of $1,250). Substituting these values into the ratio formula, we get
Liquidity ratio =
Total liquid assets
Total current debts =
$2,225
$21,539 = 0.103, or 10.3,
That ratio indicates that the Smiths can cover only about 10% of their ex￾isting 1-year debt obligations with their current liquid assets. Clearly, the 
Smiths plan to meet these debt obligations from their income, but this ratio 
suggests that their liquid funds do not provide a large cushion. One of their 
goals should probably be to build up a larger fund of liquid assets to meet un￾expected expenses.
QuICK (ACId-TEST) RATIO
The quick (acid-test) ratio is similar to the current ratio except that it excludes in￾ventory, which is generally the least liquid current asset. The generally low liquidity 
of inventory results from two primary factors: (1) Many types of inventory cannot 
be easily sold because they are partially completed items, special-purpose items, 
and the like; and (2) inventory is typically sold on credit, which means that it be￾comes an account receivable before being converted into cash. An additional prob￾lem with inventory as a liquid asset is that the times when companies face the most 
dire need for liquidity, when business is bad, are precisely the times when it is most 
difficult to convert inventory into cash by selling it. The quick ratio is calculated as
Personal Finance Example 3.4 ▶
quick (acid-test) ratio
A measure of liquidity calculated 
by dividing the firm’s current 
assets minus inventory by its 
current liabilities.
 Quick ratio =
Current assets - Inventory
Current liabilities (3.2)
The quick ratio for Bartlett Company in 2015 is
$1,223,000 - $289,000
$620,000 =
$934,000
$620,000 = 1.51
As with the current ratio, the quick ratio level that a firm should strive to 
achieve depends largely on the nature of the business in which it operates. The 
quick ratio provides a better measure of overall liquidity only when a firm’s in￾ventory cannot be easily converted into cash. If inventory is liquid, the current 
ratio is a preferred measure of overall liquidity.

quick ratio be preferred?
 3–10 In Table 3.5, most of the specific firms listed have current ratios that fall 
below the industry average. Why? The exception to this general pattern 
is Whole Foods Market, which competes at the very high end of the re￾tail grocery market. Why might Whole Foods Market operate with 
greater-than-average liquidity?
 3.4 Activity Ratios
Activity ratios measure the speed with which various accounts are converted 
into sales or cash, or inflows or outflows. In a sense, activity ratios measure how 
efficiently a firm operates along a variety of dimensions such as inventory manage￾ment, disbursements, and collections. A number of ratios are available for measur￾ing the activity of the most important current accounts, which include inventory, 
accounts receivable, and accounts payable. The efficiency with which total assets 
are used can also be assessed.

Inventory turnover commonly measures the activity, or liquidity, of a firm’s in￾ventory. It is calculated as

urn again to Table 3.5 and examine the columns listing current and quick ratios for different 
firms and industries. Notice that Dell has a current ratio of 1.3, as do The Home Depot and 
Lowe’s. However, although the quick ratios for The Home Depot and Lowe’s are dramatically 
lower than their current ratios, for Dell the current and quick ratios have nearly the same value. 
Why? For many years, Dell operated on a “built-to-order” business model that allowed it to hold 
very little inventory. In contrast, all it takes is a trip to your local Home Depot or Lowe’s store to 
see that the business model in this industry requires a massive investment in inventory, which 
implies that the quick ratio will be much less than the current ratio for building materials firms.

inventory turnover

Applying this relationship to Bartlett Company in 2015 yields
$2,088,000 , $289,000 = 7.2
The resulting turnover is meaningful only when it is compared with that of other 
firms in the same industry or to the firm’s past inventory turnover. An inventory 
turnover of 20 would not be unusual for a grocery store, whose goods are highly 
perishable and must be sold quickly, whereas an aircraft manufacturer might 
turn its inventory just four times per year.
Inventory turnover = Cost of goods sold , Inventory (3.3)122 PART 2   Financial Tools
Another inventory activity ratio measures how many days of inventory the 
firm has on hand. Inventory turnover can be easily converted into an average age 
of inventory by dividing it into 365. For Bartlett Company, the average age of 
inventory in 2015 is 50.7 days (365 , 7.2). This value can also be viewed as the 
average number of days’ sales in inventory.
AVERAGE COLLECTION PERIOd
The average collection period, or average age of accounts receivable, is useful in 
evaluating credit and collection policies. It is arrived at by dividing the average 
daily sales into the accounts receivable balance:2
average age of inventory
Average number of days’ sales 
in inventory.

otice in Table 3.5 the vast differences across industries in the average collection periods. Com￾panies in the building materials, grocery, and merchandise store industries collect in just a few 
days, whereas firms in the computer industry take roughly 2 months to collect on their sales. The dif￾ference is primarily because these industries serve very different customers. Grocery and retail stores 
serve individuals who pay cash or use credit cards (which, to the store, are essentially the same as 
cash). Computer manufacturers sell to retail chains, businesses, and other large organizations that 
negotiate agreements that allow them to pay for the computers they order well after the sale is made.

On average, it takes the firm 59.7 days to collect an account receivable.
The average collection period is meaningful only in relation to the firm’s credit 
terms. If Bartlett Company extends 30-day credit terms to customers, an average col￾lection period of 59.7 days may indicate a poorly managed credit department, collec￾tion department, or both. It is also possible that the lengthened collection period re￾sulted from an intentional relaxation of credit-term enforcement in response to 
competitive pressures. If the firm had extended 60-day credit terms, the 59.7-day 
average collection period would be quite acceptable. Clearly, additional information 
is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the firm’s credit and collection policies.ChAPTER 3   Financial Statements and Ratio Analysis 123

The difficulty in calculating this ratio stems from the need to find annual pur￾chases,3
 a value not available in published financial statements. Ordinarily, pur￾chases are estimated as a given percentage of cost of goods sold. If we assume 
that Bartlett Company’s purchases equaled 70 percent of its cost of goods sold in 
2015, its average payment period is

0.70 * $2,088,000

$4,004 = 95.4 days
The 95.4 days is meaningful only in relation to the average credit terms extended 
to the firm. If Bartlett Company’s suppliers have extended, on average, 30-day 
credit terms, an analyst would give Bartlett a low credit rating because it was tak￾ing too long to pay its bills. Prospective lenders and suppliers of trade credit are 
interested in the average payment period because it provides insight into the 
firm’s bill-paying patterns.
TOTAL ASSET TuRNOVER
The total asset turnover indicates the efficiency with which the firm uses its assets 
to generate sales. Total asset turnover is calculated as
The value of Bartlett Company’s total asset turnover in 2015 is
$3,074,000 , $3,597,000 = 0.85
which means that the company turns over its assets 0.85 times per year.124 PART 2   Financial Tools
Generally, the higher a firm’s total asset turnover, the more efficiently its 
assets have been used. This measure is probably of greatest interest to management 
because it indicates whether the firm’s operations have been financially efficient.

 3.5 debt Ratios
The debt position of a firm indicates the amount of other people’s money being 
used to generate profits. In general, the financial analyst is most concerned with 
long-term debts because these commit the firm to a stream of contractual pay￾ments over the long run. The more debt a firm has, the greater its risk of being 
unable to meet its contractual debt payments. Because creditors’ claims must be 
satisfied before the earnings can be distributed to shareholders, current and pro￾spective shareholders pay close attention to the firm’s ability to repay debts. 
Lenders are also concerned about the firm’s indebtedness.
In general, the more debt a firm uses in relation to its total assets, the greater 
its financial leverage. Financial leverage is the magnification of risk and return 
through the use of fixed-cost financing, such as debt and preferred stock. The 
more fixed-cost debt a firm uses, the greater will be its expected risk and return.
Patty Akers is in the process of incorporating her new business. After much anal￾ysis, she determined that an initial investment of $50,000—$20,000 in current 
assets and $30,000 in fixed assets—is necessary. These funds can be obtained in 
either of two ways. The first is the no-debt plan, under which she would invest 
the full $50,000 without borrowing. The other alternative, the debt plan, in￾volves investing $25,000 and borrowing the balance of $25,000 at 12% annual 
interest.
Patty expects $30,000 in sales, $18,000 in operating expenses, and a 40% 
tax rate. Projected balance sheets and income statements associated with the two 
plans are summarized in Table 3.6. The no-debt plan results in after-tax profits of 
$7,200, which represent a 14.4% rate of return on Patty’s $50,000 investment.

O
bserve in Table 3.5 that the grocery business turns over assets faster than any of the other 
industries listed. That makes sense because inventory is among the most valuable assets 
held by these firms, and grocery stores have to sell baked goods, dairy products, and produce 
quickly or throw such items away when they spoil. It’s true that some items in a grocery store have 
a shelf life longer than anyone really wants to know (think Twinkies), but on average a grocery 
store has to replace its entire inventory in just a few days or weeks, and that practice contributes 
to the rapid turnover of the firm’s total assets.
Sell It FastChAPTER 3   Financial Statements and Ratio Analysis 125
The debt plan results in $5,400 of after-tax profits, which represent a 21.6% rate 
of return on Patty’s investment of $25,000. The debt plan provides Patty with a 
higher rate of return, but the risk of this plan is also greater because the annual 
$3,000 of interest must be paid whether Patty’s business is profitable or not.
The previous example demonstrates that with increased debt comes greater 
risk as well as higher potential return. Therefore, the greater the financial leverage, 
the greater the potential risk and return. A detailed discussion of the effect of debt 
on the firm’s risk, return, and value is included in Chapter 12. Here, we emphasize 
the use of financial leverage ratios to assess externally a firm’s debt position.
There are two general types of leverage measures: measures of the degree of 
indebtedness and measures of the ability to service debts. The degree of indebted￾ness measures the amount of debt relative to other significant balance sheet 
amounts. Two popular measures of the degree of indebtedness are the debt ratio 
and the debt-to-equity ratio.
The second type of leverage measures, the ability to service debts, reflect a 
firm’s ability to make the payments required on a scheduled basis over the life of a 
debt. The term to service debts simply means to pay debts on time. The firm’s abil￾ity to pay certain fixed charges is measured using coverage ratios. Typically, higher 
coverage ratios are preferred (especially by the firm’s lenders), but a very high ra￾tio might indicate that the firm’s management is too conservative and might be 
able to earn higher returns by borrowing more. In general, the lower the firm’s 
coverage ratios, the less certain it is to be able to pay fixed obligations. If a firm is 
unable to pay these obligations, its creditors may seek immediate repayment, 
which in most instances would force a firm into bankruptcy. Two popular cover￾age ratios are the times interest earned ratio and the fixed-payment coverage ratio.

Measures the firm’s ability to 
make contractual interest 
payments; sometimes called the 
interest coverage ratio.
 Debt ratio = Total liabilities , Total assets (3.7)
The debt ratio for Bartlett Company in 2015 is
$1,643,000 , $3,597,000 = 0.457 = 45.7,
This value indicates that the company has financed close to half of its assets with 
debt. The higher this ratio, the greater the firm’s degree of indebtedness and the 
more financial leverage it has.
dEBT-TO-EQuITY RATIO
The debt-to-equity ratio measures the relative proportion of total liabilties to 
common stock equity used to finance the firm’s assets. As with debt ratio, the 
higher this ratio, the greater the firm’s use of financial leverage. The debt-to￾equity ratio is calculated as
The debt-to-equity ratio for Bartlett Company in 2015 is
$1,643,000 , $1,754,000 = 0.937 = 93.7,
This result tells us that for every $1.00 common stockholders have invested in 
Bartlett Company, the company owes about 94 cents to creditors. The value for 
common stock equity ($1,754,000) was found by subtracting the $200,000 of 
preferred stock equity from the total stockholders’ equity of $1,954,000. It is 
important to note that several methods exist for calculating the debt-to-equity 
ratio. A common alternative uses only long-term debt in the numerator. In that 
case, the ratio in 2015 for Bartlett Company is
$1,023,000 , $1,754,000 = 0.583 = 58.3,
When conducting ratio analyses, some financial analysts choose to focus on all 
stockholders rather than only common stockholders, in which case they use values 
relevant to all stockholders such as net profits after taxes (instead of earnings avail￾able for common stockholders) and total stockholders’ equity (instead of common 
stock equity). Clearly, different methods can lead to very different results. Regardles 
of which method is used, however, a low debt-to-equity ratio is often viewed as an 
indication that a company is not taking sufficient advantage of financial leverage to 
increase profits, whereas a high debt-to-equity ratio is often viewed as an indication 
that a company may not be able to generate enough cash to satisfy its debt obligations.
TIMES INTEREST EARNEd RATIO
The times interest earned ratio, sometimes called the interest coverage ratio, mea￾sures the firm’s ability to make contractual interest payments. The higher its 
value, the better able the firm is to fulfill its interest obligations. The times inter￾est earned ratio is calculated as
Debt to equity ratio = Total liabilities , Common stock equity (3.8)ChAPTER 3   Financial Statements and Ratio Analysis 127
The figure for earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is the same as that for 
operating profits shown in the income statement. Applying this ratio to Bartlett 
Company yields the 2015 value of
Time interest earned ratio = $418,000 , $93,000 = 4.49
The times interest earned ratio for Bartlett Company seems acceptable. A value of at 
least 3.0—and preferably closer to 5.0—is often suggested. The firm’s earnings be￾fore interest and taxes could shrink by as much as 78 percent [(4.49 2 1.0) 4 4.49] 
and the firm would still be able to pay the $93,000 in interest it owes. Thus, the firm 
has a large margin of safety.
FIxEd-PAYMENT COVERAGE RATIO
The fixed-payment coverage ratio measures the firm’s ability to meet all fixed￾payment obligations such as loan interest and principal, lease payments, and pre￾ferred stock dividends. As is true of the times interest earned ratio, the higher this 
value, the better. The formula for the fixed-payment coverage ratio is

where T is the corporate tax rate applicable to the firm’s income. The term 1/(1 -
T) is included to adjust the after-tax principal and preferred stock dividend pay￾ments back to a before-tax equivalent that is consistent with the before-tax values 
of all other terms. Applying the formula to Bartlett Company’s 2015 data yields

=
$453,000
$242,000 = 1.87
Because the earnings available are nearly twice as large as its fixed-payment obli￾gations, the firm appears safely able to meet the latter.
Like the times interest earned ratio, the fixed-payment coverage ratio mea￾sures risk. The lower the ratio, the greater the risk to both lenders and owners, 
and the greater the ratio, the lower the risk. This ratio allows interested parties to 
assess the firm’s ability to meet additional fixed-payment obligations without be￾ing driven into bankruptcy.

 3.6 Profitability Ratios
There are many measures of profitability. As a group, these measures enable ana￾lysts to evaluate the firm’s profits with respect to a given level of sales, a certain 
level of assets, or the owners’ investment. Without profits, a firm could not at￾tract outside capital. Owners, creditors, and management pay close attention to 
boosting profits because of the great importance the market places on earnings.
COMMON-SIZE INCOME STATEMENTS
A useful tool for evaluating profitability in relation to sales is the common-size 
income statement. Each item on this statement is expressed as a percentage of sales. 
Common-size income statements are especially useful when comparing perfor￾mance across years because it is easy to see if certain categories of expenses are 
trending up or down as a percentage of the total volume of business that the com￾pany transacts. Three frequently cited ratios of profitability that come directly from 
the common-size income statement are (1) the gross profit margin, (2) the operat￾ing profit margin, and (3) the net profit margin.
Common-size income statements for 2015 and 2014 for Bartlett Company are 
presented and evaluated in Table 3.7 on page 129. These statements reveal that the 
firm’s cost of goods sold increased from 66.7 percent of sales in 2014 to 67.9 percent 
in 2015, resulting in a worsening gross profit margin. However, thanks to a decrease 
in total operating expenses, the firm’s net profit margin rose from 5.4 percent of sales 
in 2014 to 7.2 percent in 2015. The decrease in expenses more than compensated for 
the increase in the cost of goods sold. A decrease in the firm’s 2015 interest expense 
(3.0 percent of sales versus 3.5 percent in 2014) added to the increase in 2015 profits.
GROSS PROFIT MARGIN
The gross profit margin measures the percentage of each sales dollar remaining 
after the firm has paid for its goods. The higher the gross profit margin, the better 
(that is, the lower the relative cost of merchandise sold). The gross profit margin 
is calculated as

The net profit margin is a commonly cited measure of the firm’s success with re￾spect to earnings on sales. “Good” net profit margins differ considerably across indus￾tries. A net profit margin of 1 percent or less would not be unusual for a grocery store, 
whereas a net profit margin of 10 percent would be low for a retail jewelry store.
EARNINGS PER ShARE (EPS)
The firm’s earnings per share (EPS) is generally of interest to present or prospec￾tive stockholders and management. As we noted earlier, EPS represents the num￾ber of dollars earned during the period on behalf of each outstanding share of 
common stock. Earnings per share is calculated as
return on total assets (ROA)
Measures the overall 
effectiveness of management in 
generating profits with its 
available assets; also called the 
return on investment (ROI).
return on equity (ROE)
Measures the return earned on 
the common stockholders’ 
investment in the firm.
Earnings per share =
Earnings available for common stockholders
Number of shares of common stock outstanding (3.14)
Bartlett Company’s earnings per share in 2015 is
$221,000 , 76,262 = $2.90
This figure represents the dollar amount earned on behalf of each outstanding share 
of common stock. The dollar amount of cash actually distributed to each shareholder 
is the dividend per share (DPS), which, as noted in Bartlett Company’s income state￾ment (Table 3.1), rose to $1.29 in 2015 from $0.75 in 2014. EPS is closely watched 
by the investing public and is considered an important indicator of corporate success.
RETuRN ON TOTAL ASSETS (ROA)
The return on total assets (ROA), often called the return on investment (ROI),
measures the overall effectiveness of management in generating profits with its 
available assets. The higher the firm’s return on total assets, the better. The return 
on total assets is calculated as
ROA = Earnings available for common stockholders , Total assets (3.15)
Bartlett Company’s return on total assets in 2015 is
$221,000 , $3,597,000 = 0.061 = 6.1,
This value indicates that the company earned 6.1 cents on each $1.00 of common 
stockholders’ asset investment. When a firm has preferred stock outstanding, the 
return on assets can be calculated for all stockholders by dividing the net profits 
after taxes by total assets. In this case, you would arrive at an ROA of 6.4 percent.
RETuRN ON EQuITY (ROE)
The return on equity (ROE) measures the return earned on the common stock￾holders’ investment in the firm. Generally, the owners are better off the higher is 
this return. Return on equity is calculated as
ROE 5 Earnings available for common stockholders 4 Common stock equity (3.16)ChAPTER 3   Financial Statements and Ratio Analysis 131
The ROE for Bartlett Company in 2015 is
$221,000 , $1,754,000 = 0.126 = 12.6,
The calculated ROE of 12.6 percent indicates that during 2015 Bartlett earned 
12.6 cents on each $1.00 of common stock equity. Here again, some analysts 
will elect to calculate ROE across stockholders when preferred stock is out￾standing. In this case, net profits after taxes ($231,000) is divided by total 
stockholders’ equity ($1,954,000) to arrive at return on total stockholders’ eq￾uity of 11.8 percent. More often than not, publicly traded companies will not 
have preferred stock, so the return on total stockholders’ equity will, more of￾ten than not, be the same as the ROE for common equity. The same can be said 
for the ROA calculations.

 3.7 Market Ratios
Market ratios relate the firm’s market value, as measured by its current share 
price, to certain accounting values. These ratios give insight into how investors in 
the marketplace believe that the firm is doing in terms of risk and return. They 
tend to reflect, on a relative basis, the common stockholders’ assessment of all 
aspects of the firm’s past and expected future performance. Here we consider two 
widely quoted market ratios, one that focuses on earnings and another that con￾siders book value.
PRICE/EARNINGS (P/E) RATIO
The price/earnings (P/E) ratio is commonly used to assess the owners’ appraisal 
of share value. The P/E ratio measures the amount that investors are willing to 
pay for each dollar of a firm’s earnings. The level of this ratio indicates the degree 
of confidence that investors have in the firm’s future performance. The higher the 
P/E ratio, the greater the investor confidence. The P/E ratio is calculated as

 P/E ratio 5 Market price per share of common stock 4 Earnings per share (3.17)
If Bartlett Company’s common stock at the end of 2015 was selling at $32.25, 
the P/E ratio, using the EPS of $2.90, at year-end 2015 is
$32.25 , $2.90 = 11.12
This figure indicates that investors were paying $11.12 for each $1.00 of earn￾ings. The P/E ratio is most informative when applied in cross-sectional analysis 
using an industry average P/E ratio or the P/E ratio of a benchmark firm.132 PART 2   Financial Tools
MARKET/BOOK (M/B) RATIO
The market/book (M/B) ratio provides an assessment of how investors view the 
firm’s performance. It relates the market value of the firm’s shares to its book—
strict accounting—value. To calculate the firm’s M/B ratio, we first need to find 
the book value per share of common stock:
market/book (M/B) ratio
Provides an assessment of how 
investors view the firm’s 
performance. Firms expected 
to earn high returns relative to 
their risk typically sell at higher 
M/B multiples. Book value per share
of common stock =
Common stock equity
Number of shares of common stock outstanding (3.18)
Substituting the appropriate values for Bartlett Company from its 2015 balance 
sheet, we get
Book value per share
of common stock =
$1,754,000
76,262 = $23.00
The formula for the market/book ratio is
Market/book (M/B) ratio =
Market price per share of common stock
Book value per share of common stock (3.19)
Substituting Bartlett Company’s end of 2015 common stock price of $32.25 and 
its $23.00 book value per share of common stock (calculated above) into the M/B 
ratio formula, we get
$32.25 , $23.00 = 1.40
This M/B ratio means that investors are currently paying $1.40 for each $1.00 of 
book value of Bartlett Company’s stock.
The stocks of firms that are expected to perform well—improve profits, in￾crease their market share, or launch successful products—typically sell at higher 
M/B ratios than the stocks of firms with less attractive outlooks. Simply stated, 
firms expected to earn high returns relative to their risk typically sell at higher 
M/B multiples. Clearly, Bartlett’s future prospects are being viewed favorably by 
investors, who are willing to pay more than their book value for the firm’s shares. 
Like P/E ratios, M/B ratios are typically assessed cross-sectionally to get a feel for 
the firm’s return and risk compared to peer firms.

3.8 A Complete Ratio Analysis
Analysts frequently wish to take an overall look at the firm’s financial performance 
and status. Here we consider two popular approaches to a complete ratio analysis: 
(1) summarizing all ratios and (2) the DuPont system of analysis. The summary 
analysis approach tends to view all aspects of the firm’s financial activities to iso￾late key areas of responsibility. The DuPont system acts as a search technique 
aimed at finding the key areas responsible for the firm’s financial condition.
LG 6ChAPTER 3   Financial Statements and Ratio Analysis 133
SuMMARIZING ALL RATIOS
We can use Bartlett Company’s ratios to perform a complete ratio analysis using 
both cross-sectional and time-series analysis approaches. The 2015 ratio values 
calculated earlier and the ratio values calculated for 2013 and 2014 for Bartlett 
Company, along with the industry average ratios for 2015, are summarized in 
Table 3.8 (see pages 134 and 135), which also shows the formula used to calcu￾late each ratio. Using these data, we can discuss the five key aspects of Bartlett’s 
performance: liquidity, activity, debt, profitability, and market.
Liquidity
The overall liquidity of the firm seems to exhibit a reasonably stable trend, hav￾ing been maintained at a level that is relatively consistent with the industry aver￾age in 2015. The firm’s liquidity seems to be good.
Activity
Bartlett Company’s inventory appears to be in good shape. Its inventory manage￾ment seems to have improved, and in 2015 it performed at a level above that of 
the industry. The firm may be experiencing some problems with accounts receiv￾able. The average collection period seems to have crept up above that of the in￾dustry. Bartlett also appears to be slow in paying its bills; it pays nearly 30 days 
slower than the industry average, which could adversely affect the firm’s credit 
standing. Although overall liquidity appears to be good, the management of re￾ceivables and payables should be examined. Bartlett’s total asset turnover reflects 
a decline in the efficiency of total asset utilization between 2013 and 2014. Al￾though in 2015 it rose to a level considerably above the industry average, it ap￾pears that the pre-2014 level of efficiency has not yet been achieved.
debt
Bartlett Company’s indebtedness increased over the 2013–2015 period and is 
currently above the industry average. Although this increase in the debt ratio 
could be cause for alarm, the firm’s ability to meet interest and fixed-payment 
obligations improved, from 2014 to 2015, to a level that outperforms the indus￾try. The firm’s increased indebtedness in 2014 apparently caused deterioration in 
its ability to pay debt adequately. However, Bartlett has evidently improved its 
income in 2015 so that it is able to meet its interest and fixed-payment obliga￾tions at a level consistent with the average in the industry. In summary, it appears 
that although 2014 was an off year, the company’s improved ability to pay debts 
in 2015 compensates for its increased degree of indebtedness.
Profitability
Bartlett’s profitability relative to sales in 2015 was better than the average company 
in the industry, although it did not match the firm’s 2013 performance. Although 
the gross profit margin was better in 2014 and 2015 than in 2013, higher levels of 
operating and interest expenses in 2014 and 2015 appear to have caused the 2015 
net profit margin to fall below that of 2013. However, Bartlett Company’s 2015 net 
profit margin is quite favorable when compared with the industry average.
The firm’s earnings per share, return on total assets, and return on common 
equity behaved much as its net profit margin did over the 2013–2015 period. 
Bartlett appears to have experienced either a sizable drop in sales between 2013 
and 2014 or a rapid expansion in assets during that period.

high 2015 level of return on common equity suggests that the firm is performing 
quite well. The firm’s above-average returns—net profit margin, EPS, ROA, and 
ROE—may be attributable to it being more risky than average. A look at market 
ratios is helpful in assessing risk.
Market
Investors have greater confidence in the firm in 2015 than in the prior 2 years, as 
reflected in the price/earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.1. However, this ratio is below the 
industry average. The P/E ratio suggests that the firm’s risk has declined but re￾mains above that of the average firm in its industry. The firm’s market/book 
(M/B) ratio has increased over the 2013–2015 period, and in 2015 it exceeds the 
industry average, which implies that investors are optimistic about the firm’s fu￾ture performance. The P/E and M/B ratios reflect the firm’s increased profitability 
over the 2013–2015 period: Investors expect to earn high future returns as com￾pensation for the firm’s above-average risk.
In summary, the firm appears to be growing and has recently undergone an 
expansion in assets, financed primarily through the use of debt. The 2014–2015 
period seems to reflect a phase of adjustment and recovery from the rapid growth 
in assets. Bartlett’s sales, profits, and other performance factors seem to be grow￾ing with the increase in the size of the operation. In addition, the market response 
to these accomplishments appears to have been positive. In short, the firm seems 
to have done well in 2015.
duPONT SYSTEM OF ANALYSIS
The DuPont system of analysis is used to dissect the firm’s financial statements 
and to assess its financial condition. It merges the income statement and balance 
sheet into two summary measures of profitability, return on total assets (ROA) 
and return on common equity (ROE). Figure 3.2 depicts the basic DuPont system 
with Bartlett Company’s 2015 monetary and ratio values. The upper portion of 
the chart summarizes the income statement activities, and the lower portion sum￾marizes the balance sheet activities.
duPont Formula
The DuPont system first brings together the net profit margin, which measures 
the firm’s profitability on sales, with its total asset turnover, which indicates how 
efficiently the firm has used its assets to generate sales. In the DuPont formula,
the product of these two ratios results in the return on total assets (ROA):
ROA = Net profit margin * Total asset turnover
Substituting the appropriate formulas for net profit margin and total asset turnover 
into the equation and simplifying results in the formula for ROA given earlier,
ROA =

common stockholders

This value is the same as that calculated directly in Section 3.6 (page 130). The Du￾Pont formula enables the firm to break down its return into profit-on-sales and effi￾ciency-of-asset-use components. Typically, a firm with a low net profit margin has a 
high total asset turnover, which results in a reasonably good return on total assets. 
Often, the opposite situation exists.
Modified duPont Formula
The second step in the DuPont system employs the modified DuPont formula.
This formula relates the firm’s return on total assets (ROA) to its return on eq￾uity (ROE). The latter is calculated by multiplying the return on total assets 
(ROA) by the financial leverage multiplier (FLM), which is the ratio of total as￾sets to common stock equity:
ROE = ROA * FLM
Substituting the appropriate formulas for ROA and FLM into the equation and 
simplifying results in the formula for ROE given earlier:
ROE =
Earnings available for
common stockholders
Total assets *
Total assets
Common stock equity =
Earnings available for
common stockholders
Common stock equity
Use of the FLM to convert the ROA into the ROE reflects the effect of financial 
leverage on owners’ return. Substituting the values for Bartlett Company’s ROA 
of 6.1 percent, calculated earlier, and Bartlett’s FLM of 2.051 ($3,597,000 total 
assets , $1,754,000 common stock equity) into the modified DuPont formula yields
ROE = 6.1, * 2.06 = 12.6,
The 12.6 percent ROE calculated by using the modified DuPont formula is the 
same as that calculated directly (page 131).
The FLM is also often referred to as the equity multiplier, and it is sometimes 
calculated using total stockholder’s equity in the denominator. Regardless of 
whether one chooses to use common stock equity or total stockholders’ equity, it 
is important to realize that the multiplier, the debt ratio, and debt-to-equity ratio 
are all related such that any one of them can be directly calculated from the other 
two. For example, using the debt-to-equity and debt ratios shown on page 126, 
we can calculate the multiplier as
0.937 , 0.457 = 2.05
In this case, we see that the debt-to-equity ratio divided by the debt ratio provides 
us with the financial leverage multiplier. Just be sure that your choices of liabili￾ties and stockholder equity are consistent across the three measures when relating 
them to one another.
Applying the duPont System
The advantage of the DuPont system is that it allows the firm to break its return 
on equity into a profit-on-sales component (net profit margin), an efficiency-of￾asset-use component (total asset turnover), and a use-of-financial-leverage com￾ponent (financial leverage multiplier). The total return to owners can therefore be 
analyzed in these important dimensions.
The use of the DuPont system of analysis as a diagnostic tool is best explained 
using Figure 3.2. Beginning with the rightmost value—the ROE—the financial 
modified DuPont formula
Relates the firm’s return on total 
assets (ROA) to its return on 
equity (ROE) using the financial 
leverage multiplier (FLM).

eturn to Table 3.5, and 
examine the total asset 
turnover figures for Dell and 
The Home Depot. Both firms 
turn their assets 1.6 times per 
year. Now look at the return 
on assets column. Dell’s ROA 
is 4.3 percent, but The Home 
Depot’s is significantly higher 
at 6.5 percent. If the two firms 
are equal in terms of the effi￾ciency with which they man￾age their assets (that is, equal 
asset turns), why is The Home 
Depot more profitable relative 
to assets? The answer lies in 
the DuPont formula. Notice 
that Home Depot’s net profit 
margin is 4.0 percent com￾pared with Dell’s 2.7 percent. 
That difference drives the su￾perior ROA figures for The 
Home Depot.ChAPTER 3   Financial Statements and Ratio Analysis 139
analyst moves to the left, dissecting and analyzing the inputs to the formula to 
isolate the probable cause of the resulting above-average (or below-average) value.
For the sake of demonstration, let’s ignore all industry average data in Table 3.8 
and assume that Bartlett’s ROE of 12.6% is actually below the industry average. 
Moving to the left in Figure 3.2, we would examine the inputs to the ROE—the 
ROA and the FLM—relative to the industry averages. Let’s assume that the FLM is 
in line with the industry average but the ROA is below the industry average. Mov￾ing farther to the left, we examine the two inputs to the ROA, the net profit margin 
and total asset turnover. Assume that the net profit margin is in line with the indus￾try average but the total asset turnover is below the industry average. Moving still 
farther to the left, we find that whereas the firm’s sales are consistent with the in￾dustry value, Bartlett’s total assets have grown significantly during the past year. 
Looking farther to the left, we would review the firm’s activity ratios for current 
assets. Let’s say that whereas the firm’s inventory turnover is in line with the indus￾try average, its average collection period is well above the industry average.
We can readily trace the possible problem back to its cause: Bartlett’s low 
ROE is primarily the consequence of slow collections of accounts receivable, 
which resulted in high levels of receivables and therefore high levels of total as￾sets. The high total assets slowed Bartlett’s total asset turnover, driving down its 
ROA, which then drove down its ROE. By using the DuPont system of analysis 
to dissect Bartlett’s overall returns as measured by its ROE, we found that slow 
collections of receivables caused the below-industry-average ROE. Clearly, the 
firm needs to manage its credit operations better.

Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
Financial managers review and analyze the firm’s financial statements periodically, 
both to uncover developing problems and to assess the firm’s progress toward 
achieving its goals. These actions are aimed at preserving and creating value for the 
firm’s owners. Financial ratios enable financial managers to monitor the pulse of the 
firm and its progress toward its strategic goals. Although financial statements and 
financial ratios rely on accrual concepts, they can provide useful insights into 
important aspects of risk and return (cash flow) that affect share price.

REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
LG 1 Review the contents of the stockholders’ report and the procedures 
for consolidating international financial statements. The annual stockholders’ 
report, which publicly owned corporations must provide to stockholders, 
documents the firm’s financial activities of the past year. It includes the letter 
to stockholders and various subjective and factual information. It also 
contains four key financial statements: the income statement, the balance 
sheet, the statement of stockholders’ equity (or its abbreviated form, the 
statement of retained earnings), and the statement of cash flows. Notes 
describing the technical aspects of the financial statements follow. Financial 
statements of companies that have operations whose cash flows are 
denominated in one or more foreign currencies must be translated into U.S. 
dollars in accordance with FASB Standard No. 52.
LG 2 Understand who uses financial ratios and how. Ratio analysis enables 
stockholders, lenders, and the firm’s managers to evaluate the firm’s financial 
performance. It can be performed on a cross-sectional or a time-series basis. 
Benchmarking is a popular type of cross-sectional analysis. Users of ratios 
should understand the cautions that apply to their use.
LG 3 Use ratios to analyze a firm’s liquidity and activity. Liquidity, or the 
ability of the firm to pay its bills as they come due, can be measured by the 
current ratio and the quick (acid-test) ratio. Activity ratios measure the speed 
with which accounts are converted into sales or cash, or inflows or outflows. 
The activity of inventory can be measured by its turnover: that of accounts 
receivable by the average collection period and that of accounts payable by the 
average payment period. Total asset turnover measures the efficiency with which 
the firm uses its assets to generate sales.
LG 4 Discuss the relationship between debt and financial leverage and the 
ratios used to analyze a firm’s debt. The more debt a firm uses, the greater 
its financial leverage, which magnifies both risk and return. Financial debt 
ratios measure both the degree of indebtedness and the ability to service debts. 
A common measure of indebtedness is the debt ratio. The ability to pay fixed 
charges can be measured by times interest earned and fixed-payment coverage 
ratios.
LG 5 Use ratios to analyze a firm’s profitability and its market value. The 
common-size income statement, which shows each item as a percentage of sales, 
can be used to determine gross profit margin, operating profit margin, and net 
profit margin. Other measures of profitability include earnings per share, return on 
total assets, and return on common equity. Market ratios include the price/earnings 
ratio and the market/book ratio.
LG 6 Use a summary of financial ratios and the DuPont system of analysis to 
perform a complete ratio analysis. A summary of all ratios can be used to 
perform a complete ratio analysis using cross-sectional and time-series analysis.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
Accounting You need to understand how depreciation is used for both tax 
and financial reporting purposes; how to develop the statement of cash flows; the 
primary focus on cash flows, rather than accruals, in financial decision making; 
and how pro forma financial statements are used within the firm.
informAtion SYStemS You need to understand the data that must be kept to 
record depreciation for tax and financial reporting, the information needed for 
strategic and operating plans, and what data are needed as inputs for preparing 
cash plans and profit plans.
mAnAgement You need to understand the difference between strategic and 
operating plans, and the role of each; the importance of focusing on the firm’s 
cash flows; and how use of pro forma statements can head off trouble for the 
firm.
mArketing You need to understand the central role that marketing plays in for￾mulating the firm’s long-term strategic plans and the importance of the sales fore￾cast as the key input for both cash planning and profit planning.
operAtionS You need to understand how depreciation affects the value of the 
firm’s plant assets, how the results of operations are captured in the statement of 
cash flows, that operations provide key inputs into the firm’s short-term financial 
plans, and the distinction between fixed and variable operating costs.
In your personal life individuals, like corporations, should focus on 
cash flow when planning and monitoring fi￾nances. You should establish short- and long-term financial goals (destinations) 
and develop personal financial plans (road maps) that will guide their achieve￾ment. cash flows and financial plans are as important for individuals as for 
corporations.163
Making a Profit While Bleeding Cash
O
n May 14, 2013, the European Aeronautic 
Defense and Space Co. (EADS), parent com￾pany of the aircraft manufacturer Airbus, reported a 
56 percent increase in its operating profits during the 
year’s first quarter. The increase in earnings was higher 
than most analysts had expected, as was the increase in revenue that EADS reported. All that 
seemed like good news, but analysts who dug deeper into the firm’s financial statements discov￾ered that not all was well with the company. Specifically, during the first quarter EADS reported 
free cash flow of –3.2 billion euros. The negative free cash flow was primarily the result of a 
ramp-up in production of Airbus planes, which required the firm to accumulate a great deal of 
inventory.
The situation at EADS is not particuarly uncommon. Even when a firm is reporting positive 
earnings, its cash flow picture may be quite different. When a firm is expanding, as EADS was in 
the first quarter of 2013, it may have to make additional investments in inventory, receivables, and 
fixed assets such as machinery. Cash outlays for those investments do not necessarily show up imme￾diately in the profit calculation, but they do reduce free cash flow, a performance measure that finan￾cial analysts watch closely. Cash flow is the primary driver of a firm’s value, and firms must have 
cash, not earnings, to pay their bills. After reading this chapter, you’ll understand the differences 
between cash flow and profit.

4.1 Analyzing the Firm’s Cash Flow
“Cash is king” is an old saying in finance. Cash flow, the lifeblood of the firm, is 
the primary ingredient in any financial valuation model. Whether an analyst 
wants to put a value on an investment that a firm is considering or the objective is 
to value the firm itself, estimating cash flow is central to the valuation process. 
This chapter explains where the cash flow numbers used in valuations come from.
dEPRECIATION
For tax and financial reporting purposes, businesses generally cannot deduct as 
an expense the full cost of an asset that will be in use for several years. Instead, 
each year firms are required to charge a portion of the costs of fixed assets against 
revenues. This allocation of historical cost over time is called depreciation.
Depreciation deductions, like any other business expenses, reduce the income 
that a firm reports on its income statement and therefore reduce the taxes that the 
firm must pay. However, depreciation deductions are not associated with any 
cash outlay. That is, when a firm deducts depreciation expense, it is allocating a 
portion of an asset’s original cost (that the firm has already paid for) as a charge 
against that year’s income. The net effect is that depreciation deductions increase 
a firm’s cash flow because they reduce a firm’s tax bill.
For tax purposes, the depreciation of business assets is regulated by the Inter￾nal Revenue Code. Because the objectives of financial reporting sometimes differ 
from those of tax legislation, firms often use different depreciation methods for 
financial reporting than those required for tax purposes. Keeping two different 
sets of records for these two purposes is legal in the United States.
Depreciation for tax purposes is determined by using the modified acceler￾ated cost recovery system (MACRS); a variety of depreciation methods are avail￾able for financial reporting purposes. All depreciation methods require you to 
know an asset’s depreciable value and its depreciable life.
depreciable Value of an Asset
Under the basic MACRS procedures, the depreciable value of an asset (the 
amount to be depreciated) is its full cost, including outlays for installation. Even 
if the asset is expected to have some salvage value at the end of its useful life, the 
firm can still take depreciation deductions equal to the asset’s full initial cost.
Baker Corporation acquired a new machine at a cost of $38,000, with installa￾tion costs of $2,000. When the machine is retired from service, Baker expects to 
sell it for scrap metal and receive $1,000. Regardless of its expected salvage value, 
the depreciable value of the machine is $40,000: $38,000 cost + $2,000 installa￾tion cost.
depreciable Life of an Asset
The time period over which an asset is depreciated is called its depreciable life.
The shorter the depreciable life, the larger the annual depreciation deductions 
will be, and the larger will be the tax savings associated with those deductions, all 
other things being equal. Accordingly, firms generally would like to depreciate

their assets as rapidly as possible. However, the firm must abide by certain Inter￾nal Revenue Service (IRS) requirements for determining depreciable life. These 
MACRS standards, which apply to both new and used assets, require the tax￾payer to use as an asset’s depreciable life the appropriate MACRS recovery 
period. There are six MACRS recovery periods—3, 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 years—
excluding real estate. It is customary to refer to the property classes as 3-, 5-, 7-, 
10-, 15-, and 20-year property. The first four property classes—those routinely 
used by business—are defined in Table 4.1.
dEPRECIATION METhOdS
For financial reporting purposes, companies can use a variety of depreciation 
methods (straight-line, double-declining balance, and sum-of-the-years’-digits). 
For tax purposes, assets in the first four MACRS property classes are depreciated 
by the double-declining balance method, using a half-year convention (meaning 
that a half-year’s depreciation is taken in the year the asset is purchased) and 
switching to straight-line when advantageous. The approximate percentages 
(rounded to the nearest whole percent) written off each year for the first four 
property classes are shown in Table 4.2. Rather than using the percentages in the 
table, the firm can either use straight-line depreciation over the asset’s recovery 
period with the half-year convention or use the alternative depreciation system. 
For purposes of this text, we will use the MACRS depreciation percentages be￾cause they generally provide for the fastest write-off and therefore the best cash 
flow effects for the profitable firm.
Because MACRS requires use of the half-year convention, assets are assumed 
to be acquired in the middle of the year; therefore, only one-half of the first year’s 
depreciation is recovered in the first year. As a result, the final half-year of depre￾ciation is recovered in the year immediately following the asset’s stated recovery 
period. In Table 4.2, the depreciation percentages for an n-year class asset are 
given for n + 1 years. For example, a 5-year asset is depreciated over 6 recovery 
years. The application of the tax depreciation percentages given in Table 4.2 can 
be demonstrated by a simple example.

dEVELOPING ThE STATEMENT OF CASh FLOWS
The statement of cash flows, introduced in Chapter 3, summarizes the firm’s cash 
flow over a given period. Keep in mind that analysts typically lump cash and 
marketable securities together when assessing the firm’s liquidity because both ChAPTER 4   Cash Flow and Financial Planning 167
Inflows and Outflows of Cash
cash and marketable securities represent a reservoir of liquidity. That reservoir is 
increased by cash inflows and decreased by cash outflows.
Also note that the firm’s cash flows fall into three categories: (1) cash flow from 
operating activities, (2) cash flow from investment activities, and (3) cash flow from 
financing activities. Cash flow from operating activities include the cash inflows and 
outflows directly related to the sale and production of the firm’s products and ser￾vices. Cash flow from investment activities include the cash flows associated with 
the purchase and sale of both fixed assets and equity investments in other firms. 
Clearly, purchase transactions would result in cash outflows, whereas sales transac￾tions would generate cash inflows. Cash flow from financing activities results from 
debt and equity financing transactions. Incurring either short-term or long-term 
debt would result in a corresponding cash inflow; repaying debt would result in an 
outflow. Similarly, the sale of the company’s stock would result in a cash inflow; the 
repurchase of stock or payment of cash dividends would result in an outflow.
Classifying Inflows and Outflows of Cash
The statement of cash flows, in effect, summarizes the inflows and outflows of 
cash during a given period. Table 4.3 classifies the basic inflows (sources) and 
outflows (uses) of cash. For example, if a firm’s accounts payable balance in￾creased by $1,000 during the year, the change would be an inflow of cash. The 
change would be an outflow of cash if the firm’s inventory increased by $2,500.
A few additional points can be made with respect to the classification scheme 
in Table 4.3:
 1. A decrease in an asset, such as the firm’s cash balance, is an inflow of cash.
Why? It is because cash that has been tied up in the asset is released and can 
be used for some other purpose, such as repaying a loan. On the other hand, 
an increase in the firm’s cash balance is an outflow of cash because addi￾tional cash is being tied up in the firm’s cash balance.
The classification of decreases and increases in a firm’s cash balance is diffi￾cult for many to grasp. To clarify, imagine that you store all your cash in a 
bucket. Your cash balance is represented by the amount of cash in the bucket. 
When you need cash, you withdraw it from the bucket, which decreases your 
cash balance and provides an inflow of cash to you. Conversely, when you have 
excess cash, you deposit it in the bucket, which increases your cash balance and 
represents an outflow of cash from you. Focus on the movement of funds in and 
out of your pocket: Clearly, a decrease in cash (from the bucket) is an inflow (to 
your pocket); an increase in cash (in the bucket) is an outflow (from your pocket).

Apple’s Cash Flows
I
n its 2012 annual report, 
Apple reported more than 
$50 billion in cash from its 
operating activities. In the 
same year, Apple used 
$48.2 billion in cash to invest 
in marketable securities and 
other investments. By 
comparison, its financing cash 
flows were minor, resulting in 
a cash outflow of about 
$1.7 billion, mostly from stock 
issued to employees as part of 
Apple’s compensation plans.
TABLE 4.3 168 PART 2   Financial Tools
Baker Corporation 2015 Income Statement ($000)
 2. Depreciation (like amortization and depletion) is a noncash charge, an 
expense that is deducted on the income statement but does not involve an 
actual outlay of cash. Therefore, when measuring the amount of cash flow 
generated by a firm, we have to add depreciation back to net income; if we 
don’t, we will understate the cash that the firm has truly generated. For this 
reason, depreciation appears as a source of cash in Table 4.3.
 3. Because depreciation is treated as a separate cash inflow, only gross rather 
than net changes in fixed assets appear on the statement of cash flows. The 
change in net fixed assets is equal to the change in gross fixed assets minus 
the depreciation charge. Therefore, if we treated depreciation as a cash in￾flow as well as the reduction in net (rather than gross) fixed assets, we would 
be double counting depreciation.
 4. Direct entries of changes in retained earnings are not included on the state￾ment of cash flows. Instead, entries for items that affect retained earnings 
appear as net profits or losses after taxes and dividends paid.
Preparing the Statement of Cash Flows
The statement of cash flows uses data from the income statement, along with the 
beginning- and end-of-period balance sheets. The income statement for the year 
ended December 31, 2015, and the December 31 balance sheets for 2014 and 
2015 for Baker Corporation are given in Tables 4.4 and 4.5 (see facing page), 
respectively. The statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015, 
for Baker Corporation is presented in Table 4.6 (see page 170). Note that all cash 
inflows as well as net profits after taxes and depreciation are treated as positive

values. All cash outflows, any losses, and dividends paid are treated as negative 
values. The items in each category—operating, investment, and financing—are 
totaled, and the three totals are added to get the “Net increase (decrease) in cash 
and marketable securities” for the period. As a check, this value should reconcile 
with the actual change in cash and marketable securities for the year, which is 
obtained from the beginning- and end-of-period balance sheets.
Interpreting the Statement
The statement of cash flows allows the financial manager and other interested 
parties to analyze the firm’s cash flow. The manager should pay special attention 
both to the major categories of cash flow and to the individual items of cash in￾flow and outflow, to assess whether any developments have occurred that are 
contrary to the company’s financial policies. In addition, the statement can be 
used to evaluate progress toward projected goals or to isolate inefficiencies. The 170 PART 2   Financial Tools

for the Year Ended December 31, 2015
financial manager also can prepare a statement of cash flows developed from 
projected financial statements to determine whether planned actions are desirable 
in view of the resulting cash flows.
Operating Cash Flow A firm’s operating cash flow (OCF) is the cash flow it 
generates from its normal operations: producing and selling its output of goods 
or services. A variety of definitions of OCF can be found in the financial litera￾ture. The definition introduced here excludes the impact of interest on cash flow. 
We exclude those effects because we want a measure that captures the cash flow 
generated by the firm’s operations, not by how those operations are financed and 
taxed. The first step is to calculate net operating profits after taxes (NOPAT),
which represent the firm’s earnings before interest and after taxes. Letting T
equal the applicable corporate tax rate, NOPAT is calculated as
NOPAT = EBIT * (1 - T) (4.1)

the combination of the “Net profits after taxes” and “Dividends paid” entries.

EBIT × (1 − T ).ChAPTER 4   Cash Flow and Financial Planning 171
To convert NOPAT to operating cash flow (OCF), we merely add back 
depreciation:
OCF = NOPAT + Depreciation (4.2)
We can substitute the expression for NOPAT from Equation 4.1 into Equation 
4.2 to get a single equation for OCF:
OCF = 3EBIT * (1 - T) 4 + Depreciation (4.3)
Substituting the values for Baker Corporation from its income statement (Table 
4.4) into Equation 4.3, we get
OCF = 3$370 * (1.00 - 0.40) 4 + $100 = $222 + $100 = $322
During 2015, Baker Corporation generated $322,000 of cash flow from produc￾ing and selling its output. Therefore, we can conclude that Baker’s operations are 
generating positive cash flows.
FREE CASh FLOW
The firm’s free cash flow (FCF) represents the cash available to investors—the 
providers of debt (creditors) and equity (owners)—after the firm has met all op￾erating needs and paid for net investments in fixed assets and current assets. Free 
cash flow can be defined as
FCF = OCF - Net fixed asset investment (NFAI)
- Net current asset investment (NCAI) (4.4)
The net fixed asset investment (NFAI) is the net investment that the firm 
makes in fixed assets and refers to purchases minus sales of fixed assets. You can 
calculate the NFAI using
NFAI = Change in net fixed assets + Depreciation (4.5)
The NFAI is also equal to the change in gross fixed assets from one year to the next.
Using the Baker Corporation’s balance sheets in Table 4.5, we see that its change 
in net fixed assets between 2014 and 2015 was $200 ($1,200 in 2015 − $1,000 
in 2014). Substituting this value and the $100 of depreciation for 2015 into 
Equation 4.5, we get Baker’s net fixed asset investment (NFAI) for 2015:
NFAI = $200 + $100 = $300
Baker Corporation therefore invested a net $300,000 in fixed assets during 2015. 
This amount would, of course, represent a cash outflow to acquire fixed assets 
during 2015.

free cash flow (FCF)
The amount of cash flow

and owners) after the firm has 
met all operating needs and 
paid for investments in net 
fixed assets and net current 
assets.

Looking at Equation 4.5, we can see that if net fixed assets decline by an amount 
exceeding the depreciation for the period, the NFAI would be negative. A nega￾tive NFAI represents a net cash inflow attributable to the firm selling more assets 
than it acquired during the year.
The net current asset investment (NCAI) represents the net investment made 
by the firm in its current (operating) assets. “Net” refers to the difference be￾tween current assets and the sum of accounts payable and accruals. Notes pay￾able are not included in the NCAI calculation because they represent a negotiated 
creditor claim on the firm’s free cash flow. The NCAI calculation is
NCAI = Change in current assets - Change in (accounts payable + accruals)
(4.6)
Looking at the Baker Corporation’s balance sheets for 2014 and 2015 in Table 
4.5, we see that the change in current assets between 2014 and 2015 is $100 
($2,000 in 2015 − $1,900 in 2014). The difference between Baker’s accounts 
payable plus accruals of $800 in 2015 ($700 in accounts payable + $100 in ac￾cruals) and of $700 in 2014 ($500 in accounts payable + $200 in accruals) is
$100 ($800 in 2015 − $700 in 2014). Substituting into Equation 4.6 the change 
in current assets and the change in the sum of accounts payable plus accruals for 
Baker Corporation, we get its 2015 NCAI:
NCAI = $100 - $100 = $0
So, during 2015 Baker Corporation made no investment ($0) in its current assets 
net of accounts payable and accruals.
Now we can substitute Baker Corporation’s 2015 operating cash flow (OCF) 
of $322, its net fixed asset investment (NFAI) of $300, and its net current asset 
investment (NCAI) of $0 into Equation 4.4 to find its free cash flow (FCF):
FCF = $322 - $300 - $0 = $22
We can see that during 2015 Baker generated $22,000 of free cash flow, which it 
can use to pay its investors: creditors (payment of interest) and owners (payment 
of dividends). Thus, the firm generated adequate cash flow to cover all its operat￾ing costs and investments and had free cash flow available to pay investors. How￾ever, Baker’s interest expense in 2015 was $70,000, so the firm is not generating 
enough FCF to provide a sufficient return to its investors.
Clearly, cash flow is the lifeblood of the firm. The Focus on Practice box 
discusses Cisco System’s free cash flow. In the next section, we consider various 
aspects of financial planning for cash flow and profit.

4.2 The Financial Planning Process
Financial planning is an important aspect of the firm’s operations because it pro￾vides road maps for guiding, coordinating, and controlling the firm’s actions to 
achieve its objectives. Two key aspects of the financial planning process are cash 
planning and profit planning. Cash planning involves preparation of the firm’s 
cash budget. Profit planning involves preparation of pro forma statements. Both 
the cash budget and the pro forma statements are useful for internal financial 
planning. They also are routinely required by existing and prospective lenders.
The financial planning process begins with long-term, or strategic, financial 
plans. These plans, in turn, guide the formulation of short-term, or operating,
plans and budgets. Generally, the short-term plans and budgets implement the 
firm’s long-term strategic objectives. Although the remainder of this chapter 
places primary emphasis on short-term financial plans and budgets, a few pre￾liminary comments on long-term financial plans are in order.

LONG-TERM (STRATEGIC) FINANCIAL PLANS
Long-term (strategic) financial plans lay out a company’s planned financial ac￾tions and the anticipated effect of those actions over periods ranging from 2 to 10 
years. Five-year strategic plans, which are revised as significant new information 
becomes available, are common. Generally, firms that are subject to high degrees 
of operating uncertainty, relatively short production cycles, or both tend to use 
shorter planning horizons.
Long-term financial plans are part of an integrated strategy that, along with 
production and marketing plans, guides the firm toward strategic goals. Those 
long-term plans consider proposed outlays for fixed assets, research and develop￾ment activities, marketing and product development actions, capital structure, and 
major sources of financing. Also included would be termination of existing proj￾ects, product lines, or lines of business; repayment or retirement of outstanding 
debts; and any planned acquisitions. Such plans tend to be supported by a series of 
annual budgets. The Focus on Ethics box shows how one CEO dramatically re￾shaped his company’s operating structure, although it later cost him his job.
ShORT-TERM (OPERATING) FINANCIAL PLANS
Short-term (operating) financial plans specify short-term financial actions and the 
anticipated effect of those actions. These plans most often cover a 1- to 2-year 
period. Key inputs include the sales forecast and various forms of operating and 
financial data. Key outputs include a number of operating budgets, the cash bud￾get, and pro forma financial statements. The entire short-term financial planning 
process is outlined in Figure 4.1 below. Here we focus solely on cash and profit 
planning from the financial manager’s perspective.
Short-term financial planning begins with the sales forecast. From it, compa￾nies develop production plans that take into account lead (preparation) times and 
include estimates of the required raw materials. Using the production plans, the

firm can estimate direct labor requirements, factory overhead outlays, and oper￾ating expenses. Once these estimates have been made, the firm can prepare a pro 
forma income statement and cash budget. With these basic inputs, the firm can 
finally develop a pro forma balance sheet.
The first step in personal financial planning requires you to define 
your goals. Whereas in a corporation the goal is to maximize 
owner wealth (that is, share price), individuals typically have a number of major goals.
Generally, personal goals can be short-term (1 year), intermediate-term (2 to 
5 years), or long-term (6 or more years). The short- and intermediate-term goals sup￾port the long-term goals. Clearly, types of long-term personal goals depend on the 
individual’s or family’s age, and goals will continue to change with one’s life situation.
You should set your personal financial goals carefully and realistically. Each 
goal should be clearly defined and have a priority, time frame, and cost estimate. 
For example, a college senior’s intermediate-term goal in 2015 might include 
earning a master’s degree at a cost of $40,000 by 2017, and his or her long-term 
goal might be to buy a condominium at a cost of $125,000 by 2019.
Throughout the remainder of this chapter, we will concentrate on the key 
outputs of the short-term financial planning process: the cash budget, the pro 
forma income statement, and the pro forma balance sheet.
Personal Finance Example 4.6 ▶
When Jack Welch re￾tired as chairman and 
CEO of General Electric in 2000, Robert 
L. Nardelli was part of a lengthy and 
well-publicized succession planning saga; 
he eventually lost the job to Jeff Immelt. 
Nardelli was quickly hired by The Home 
Depot, one of several companies compet￾ing for his services, who offered generous 
incentives for him to come on board.
Using the “Six Sigma” management 
strategy from GE, Nardelli dramatically 
overhauled The Home Depot and 
replaced its freewheeling entrepreneurial 
culture. He changed the decentralized 
management structure by eliminating 
and consolidating division executives. 
He also installed processes and stream￾lined operations, most notably imple￾menting a computerized automated 
inventory system and centralizing supply 
orders at the Atlanta headquarters. 
Nardelli was credited with doubling the 
sales of the chain and improving its 
competitive position. Revenue increased 
from $45.7 billion in 2000 to $81.5 
billion in 2005, while profit rose from 
$2.6 billion to $5.8 billion.
However, the company’s stagnating 
share price, Nardelli’s results-driven 
management style, which turned off both 
employees and customers, and his com￾pensation package eventually earned 
the ire of investors. Despite having 
received the solid support of The Home 
Depot’s board of directors, Nardelli 
abruptly resigned on January 3, 2007. 
He was not destined for poverty, as his 
severance package had been negoti￾ated years earlier when he joined The 
Home Depot. The total severance pack￾age amounted to $210 million, includ￾ing $55.3 million of life insurance cov￾erage; reimbursement of $1.3 million of 
Nardelli’s personal taxes related to the 
life insurance; $50,000 to cover his 
legal fees; $33.8 million in cash due 
July 3, 2007; an additional $18 million 
over 4 years for abiding by the terms of 
the deal; and the balance of the pack￾age from accelerated vesting of stock 
options. In addition, Nardelli and his 
family would receive health care bene￾fits from the company for the next 3 
years.
The mammoth payoff for Nardelli’s 
departure caused uproar among many 
shareholder activists because The Home 
Depot’s stock fell 8 percent during his 
6-year tenure. Clearly, the mantra of 
shareholder activists today is, “Ask not 
what you can do for your company, ask 
what your company can do for share￾holders.” The spotlight will no longer be 
only on what a CEO does, but also on 
how much the CEO is paid.

leadership?

financial plans and short-term (operating) financial plans.
 4–9 Which three statements result as part of the short-term (operating) 
financial planning process?
4.3 Cash Planning: Cash Budgets
The cash budget, or cash forecast, is a statement of the firm’s planned inflows 
and outflows of cash. It is used by the firm to estimate its short-term cash require￾ments, with particular attention being paid to planning for surplus cash and for 
cash shortages.
Typically, the cash budget is designed to cover a 1-year period, divided 
into smaller time intervals. The number and type of intervals depend on the 
nature of the business. The more seasonal and uncertain a firm’s cash flows, 
the greater the number of intervals. Because many firms are confronted with a 
seasonal cash flow pattern, the cash budget is quite often presented on a 
monthly basis. Firms with stable patterns of cash flow may use quarterly or 
annual time intervals.
ThE SALES FORECAST
The key input to the short-term financial planning process is the firm’s sales 
forecast. This prediction of the firm’s sales over a given period is ordinarily pre￾pared by the marketing department. On the basis of the sales forecast, the finan￾cial manager estimates the monthly cash flows that will result from projected 
sales and from outlays related to production, inventory, and sales. The manager 
also determines the level of fixed assets required and the amount of financing, if 
any, needed to support the forecast level of sales and production. In practice, 
obtaining good data is the most difficult aspect of forecasting. The sales forecast 
may be based on an analysis of external data, internal data, or a combination of 
the two.
An external forecast is based on the relationships observed between the firm’s 
sales and certain key external economic indicators such as the gross domestic 
product (GDP), new housing starts, consumer confidence, and disposable per￾sonal income. Forecasts containing these indicators are readily available.
Internal forecasts are based on a consensus of sales forecasts through the 
firm’s own sales channels. Typically, the firm’s salespeople in the field are asked 
to estimate how many units of each type of product they expect to sell in the com￾ing year. These forecasts are collected and totaled by the sales manager, who may 
adjust the figures using knowledge of specific markets or of the salesperson’s 
forecasting ability. Finally, adjustments may be made for additional internal fac￾tors, such as production capabilities.
Firms generally use a combination of external and internal forecast data to 
make the final sales forecast. The internal data provide insight into sales expecta￾tions, and the external data provide a means of adjusting these expectations to 
take into account general economic factors. The nature of the firm’s product also 
often affects the mix and types of forecasting methods used.

The General Format of the Cash Budget
PREPARING ThE CASh BudGET
The general format of the cash budget is presented in Table 4.7. The following 
dicussion along with Tables 4.8 and 4.9 illustrates each of its components indi￾vidually. Table 4.10 presents the completed cash budget for Coulson Industries.
Total Cash Receipts
Total cash receipts include all a firm’s inflows of cash during a given financial 
period. The most common components of cash receipts are cash sales, collections 
of accounts receivable, and other cash receipts.
Coulson Industries, a defense contractor, is developing a cash budget for October, 
November, and December. Coulson’s sales in August and September were 
$100,000 and $200,000, respectively. Sales of $400,000, $300,000, and 
$200,000 have been forecast for October, November, and December, respec￾tively. Historically, 20% of the firm’s sales have been for cash, 50% have gener￾ated accounts receivable collected after 1 month, and the remaining 30% have 
generated accounts receivable collected after 2 months. Bad-debt expenses 
(uncollectible accounts) have been negligible. In December, the firm will receive a 
$30,000 dividend from stock in a subsidiary. The schedule of expected cash 
receipts for the company is presented in Table 4.8. It contains the following:
Forecast sales This initial entry is merely informational. It is provided as an 
aid in calculating other sales-related items.
Cash sales The cash sales shown for each month represent 20% of the total 
sales forecast for that month.
Collections of A/R These entries represent the collection of accounts receiv￾able (A/R) resulting from sales in earlier months.
Lagged 1 month These figures represent sales made in the preceding month 
that generated accounts receivable collected in the current month. Because 
50% of the current month’s sales are collected 1 month later, the collections of 
A/R with a 1-month lag shown for September represent 50% of the sales in 
August, collections for October represent 50% of September sales, and so on.

Lagged 2 months These figures represent sales made 2 months earlier that 
generated accounts receivable collected in the current month. Because 30%

shown for October represent 30% of the sales in August, and so on.
Other cash receipts These are cash receipts expected from sources other than sales. 
Interest received, dividends received, proceeds from the sale of equipment, stock 
and bond sale proceeds, and lease receipts may show up here. For Coulson Indus￾tries, the only other cash receipt is the $30,000 dividend due in December.
Total cash receipts This figure represents the total of all the cash receipts 
listed for each month. For Coulson Industries, we are concerned only with 
October, November, and December, as shown in Table 4.8.
Total cash disbursements
Total cash disbursements include all outlays of cash by the firm during a given 
financial period. The most common cash disbursements are
Cash purchases Fixed-asset outlays
Payments of accounts payable Interest payments
Rent (and lease) payments Cash dividend payments
Wages and salaries Principal payments (loans)
Tax payments Repurchases or retirements of stock
It is important to recognize that depreciation and other noncash charges are 
NOT included in the cash budget because they merely represent a scheduled 
write-off of an earlier cash outflow. The impact of depreciation, as we noted ear￾lier, is reflected in the reduced cash outflow for tax payments.
Coulson Industries has gathered the following data needed for the preparation of 
a cash disbursements schedule for October, November, and December.
Purchases The firm’s purchases represent 70% of sales. Of this amount, 10% is 
paid in cash, 70% is paid in the month immediately following the month of pur￾chase, and the remaining 20% is paid 2 months following the month of purchase.
Rent payments Rent of $5,000 will be paid each month.
Wages and salaries Fixed salaries for the year are $96,000, or $8,000 per 
month. In addition, wages are estimated as 10% of monthly sales.

Wages and salaries These amounts were obtained by adding $8,000 to 10% 
of the sales in each month. The $8,000 represents the salary component; the

The remaining items on the cash disbursements schedule are self-explanatory.
Net Cash Flow, Ending Cash, Financing, and Excess Cash
Look back at the general-format cash budget in Table 4.7 on page 177. We have 
inputs for the first two entries, and we now continue calculating the firm’s cash 
needs. The firm’s net cash flow is found by subtracting the cash disbursements 
from cash receipts in each period. Then we add beginning cash to the firm’s net 
cash flow to determine the ending cash for each period.
Finally, we subtract the desired minimum cash balance from ending cash to 
find the required total financing or the excess cash balance. If the ending cash is 
less than the minimum cash balance, financing is required. Such financing is typi￾cally viewed as short-term and is therefore represented by notes payable. If the 
ending cash is greater than the minimum cash balance, excess cash exists. Any 
excess cash is assumed to be invested in a liquid, short-term, interest-paying ve￾hicle, that is, in marketable securities.
Table 4.10 presents Coulson Industries’ cash budget. The company wishes to 
maintain, as a reserve for unexpected needs, a minimum cash balance of $25,000. 
For Coulson Industries to maintain its required $25,000 ending cash balance, it 
will need total borrowing of $76,000 in November and $41,000 in December. In 
October, the firm will have an excess cash balance of $22,000, which can be held 
in an interest-earning marketable security. The required total financing figures in

the cash budget refer to how much will be owed at the end of the month; they do 
not represent the monthly changes in borrowing.
The monthly changes in borrowing and in excess cash can be found by fur￾ther analyzing the cash budget. In October, the $50,000 beginning cash, which 
becomes $47,000 after the $3,000 net cash outflow, results in a $22,000 excess 
cash balance once the $25,000 minimum cash is deducted. In November, the 
$76,000 of required total financing resulted from the $98,000 net cash outflow 
less the $22,000 of excess cash from October. The $41,000 of required total fi￾nancing in December resulted from reducing November’s $76,000 of required 
total financing by the $35,000 of net cash inflow during December. Summariz￾ing, the financial activities for each month would be as follows:
October: Invest the $22,000 excess cash balance in marketable securities.
November: Liquidate the $22,000 of marketable securities and borrow 
$76,000 (notes payable).
December: Repay $35,000 of notes payable to leave $41,000 of outstand￾ing required total financing.
EVALuATING ThE CASh BudGET
The cash budget indicates whether a cash shortage or surplus is expected in each 
of the months covered by the forecast. Each month’s figure is based on the inter￾nally imposed requirement of a minimum cash balance and represents the total 
balance at the end of the month.
At the end of each of the 3 months, Coulson expects the following balances 
in cash, marketable securities, and notes payable:
End-of-month balance ($000)
Account Oct. Nov. Dec.
Cash $25 $25 $25
Marketable securities 22 0 0
Notes payable 0 76 41
Note that the firm is assumed first to liquidate its marketable securities to meet 
deficits and then to borrow with notes payable if additional financing is needed. 
As a result, it will not have marketable securities and notes payable on its books 
at the same time. Because it may be necessary to borrow up to $76,000 for the 
3-month period, the financial manager should be certain that some arrangement 
is made to ensure the availability of these funds.
Because individuals receive only a finite amount of income 
(cash inflow) during a given period, they need to prepare bud￾gets to make sure they can cover their expenses (cash outflows) during the pe￾riod. The personal budget is a short-term financial planning report that helps 
individuals or families achieve short-term financial goals. Personal budgets typi￾cally cover a 1-year period, broken into months.

Cash surplus or deficit [(1)2(2)] $ 749 ($ 516) ($2,531)
Cumulative cash surplus or deficit $ 749 $ 233 ($2,298)
The personal budget shows a cash surplus of $749 in January followed by
monthly deficits in February and March of $516 and $2,531, resulting in a cu￾mulative deficit of $2,298 through March. Clearly, to cover the deficit, some 
action—such as increasing income, reducing expenses, drawing down savings, or 
borrowing—will be necessary to bring the budget into balance. Borrowing by 
using credit can offset a deficit in the short term but can lead to financial trouble 
if done repeatedly.
COPING WITh uNCERTAINTY IN ThE CASh BudGET
Aside from careful estimation of cash budget inputs, there are two ways of cop￾ing with uncertainty in the cash budget. One is to prepare several cash budgets, 
based on pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic forecasts. From this range of 
cash flows, the financial manager can determine the amount of financing neces￾sary to cover the most adverse situation. The use of several cash budgets, based 
on differing scenarios, also should give the financial manager a sense of the 
riskiness of the various alternatives. This scenario analysis, or “what if” ap￾proach, is often used to analyze cash flows under a variety of circumstances. 
Clearly, the use of electronic spreadsheets simplifies the process of performing 
scenario analysis.
Table 4.11 presents the summary of Coulson Industries’ cash budget prepared for 
each month using pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic estimates of total cash 
receipts and disbursements. The most likely estimate is based on the expected 
outcomes presented earlier.
During October, Coulson will, at worst, need a maximum of $15,000 of fi￾nancing and, at best, will have a $62,000 excess cash balance. During November, 
its financing requirement will be between $0 and $185,000, or it could experience 
an excess cash balance of $5,000. The December projections show maximum 
borrowing of $190,000 with a possible excess cash balance of $107,000. By con￾sidering the extreme values in the pessimistic and optimistic outcomes, Coulson 
Example 4.11 ▶ChAPTER 4   Cash Flow and Financial Planning 183
A Scenario Analysis of Coulson Industries’ Cash Budget ($000)
Industries should be better able to plan its cash requirements. For the 3-month 
period, the peak borrowing requirement under the worst circumstances would be 
$190,000, which happens to be considerably greater than the most likely estimate 
of $76,000 for this period.
A second and much more sophisticated way of coping with uncertainty in the 
cash budget is simulation (discussed in Chapter 12). By simulating the occurrence 
of sales and other uncertain events, the firm can develop a probability distribu￾tion of its ending cash flows for each month. The financial decision maker can 
then use the probability distribution to determine the amount of financing needed 
to protect the firm adequately against a cash shortage.
CASh FLOW WIThIN ThE MONTh
Because the cash budget shows cash flows only on a total monthly basis, the in￾formation provided by the cash budget is not necessarily adequate for ensuring 
solvency. A firm must look more closely at its pattern of daily cash receipts and 
cash disbursements to ensure that adequate cash is available for paying bills as 
they come due.
The synchronization of cash flows in the cash budget at month-end does not 
ensure that the firm will be able to meet its daily cash requirements. Because a 
firm’s cash flows are generally quite variable when viewed on a daily basis, effec￾tive cash planning requires a look beyond the cash budget. The financial manager 
must therefore plan and monitor cash flow more frequently than on a monthly 
basis. The greater the variability of cash flows from day to day, the greater the 
amount of attention required.

4.4 Profit Planning: Pro Forma Statements
Whereas cash planning focuses on forecasting cash flows, profit planning relies 
on accrual concepts to project the firm’s profit and overall financial position. 
Shareholders, creditors, and the firm’s management pay close attention to the pro 
forma statements, which are projected income statements and balance sheets. 
The basic steps in the short-term financial planning process were shown in the 
flow diagram of Figure 4.1. The approaches for estimating the pro forma state￾ments are all based on the belief that the financial relationships reflected in the 
firm’s past financial statements will not change in the coming period. The com￾monly used simplified approaches are presented in subsequent discussions.
Two inputs are required for preparing pro forma statements: (1) financial 
statements for the preceding year and (2) the sales forecast for the coming year. A 
variety of assumptions must also be made. The company that we will use to illus￾trate the simplified approaches to pro forma preparation is Vectra Manufacturing, 
which manufactures and sells one product. It has two basic product models, X 
and Y, which are produced by the same process but require different amounts of 
raw material and labor.
PRECEdING YEAR’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The income statement for the firm’s 2015 operations is given in Table 4.12. It indi￾cates that Vectra had sales of $100,000, total cost of goods sold of $80,000, net 
profits before taxes of $9,000, and net profits after taxes of $7,650. The firm paid 
$4,000 in cash dividends, leaving $3,650 to be transferred to retained earnings. The 
firm’s balance sheet for 2015 is given in Table 4.13.
SALES FORECAST
Just as for the cash budget, the key input for pro forma statements is the sales fore￾cast. Vectra Manufacturing’s sales forecast for the coming year (2016), based on both 
external and internal data, is presented in Table 4.14. The unit sale prices of the prod￾ucts reflect an increase from $20 to $25 for model X and from $40 to $50 for model 
Y. These increases are necessary to cover anticipated increases in costs.

A Pro Forma Income Statement, Using 
the Percent-of-Sales Method, for Vectra 
Manufacturing for the Year Ended 
December 31, 2016
4.5 Preparing the Pro Forma Income Statement
A simple method for developing a pro forma income statement is the percent-of-sales 
method. It forecasts sales and then expresses the various income statement items as 
percentages of projected sales. The percentages used are likely to be the percentages 
of sales for those items in the previous year. By using dollar values taken from 
Vectra’s 2015 income statement (Table 4.12), we find that these percentages are
Cost of goods sold
Sales =
$80,000
$100,000 = 0.800 = 80.0,
Operating expenses
Sales =
$10,000
$100,000 = 0.100 = 10.0,
Interest expense
Sales =
$1,000
$100,000 = 0.010 = 1.0,
Applying these percentages to the firm’s forecast sales of $135,000 (developed in 
Table 4.14), we get the 2016 pro forma income statement shown in Table 4.15. 
We have assumed that Vectra will pay $4,000 in common stock dividends, so the 
expected contribution to retained earnings is $6,327. This represents a consider￾able increase over $3,650 in the preceding year (see Table 4.12).
CONSIdERING TYPES OF COSTS ANd ExPENSES
The technique that is used to prepare the pro forma income statement in Table 
4.15 assumes that all the firm’s costs and expenses are variable. That is, for a 
given percentage increase in sales, the same percentage increase in cost of goods 
sold, operating expenses, and interest expense would result. For example, as 
Vectra’s sales increased by 35 percent, we assumed that its costs of goods sold 
also increased by 35 percent. On the basis of this assumption, the firm’s net prof￾its before taxes also increased by 35 percent.

Because this approach assumes that all costs are variable, it may understate the 
increase in profits that will occur when sales increase if some of the firm’s costs are 
fixed. Similarly, if sales decline, the percentage-of-sales method may overstate prof￾its if some costs are fixed and do not fall when revenues decline. Therefore, a pro 
forma income statement constructed using the percentage-of-sales method gener￾ally tends to understate profits when sales are increasing and overstate profits when 
sales are decreasing. The best way to adjust for the presence of fixed costs when 
preparing a pro forma income statement is to break the firm’s historical costs and 
expenses into fixed and variable components. The potential returns as well as risks 
resulting from use of fixed (operating and financial) costs to create “leverage” are 
discussed in Chapter 13. The key point to recognize is that fixed costs make a firm’s 
profits more variable than its revenues. That is, when both profits and sales are ris￾ing, profits tend to increase at a faster rate, but when profits and sales are in de￾cline, the percentage drop in profits is often greater than the rate of decline in sales.
Vectra Manufacturing’s 2015 actual and 2016 pro forma income statements, 
broken into fixed and variable cost and expense components, follow:
Example 4.12 ▶

Gross profits $ 20,000 $ 41,000
Less: Operating expenses    
Fixed expense $ 5,000 $ 5,000
Variable expense (0.05 × sales) 5,000 6,750
Operating profits $ 10,000 $ 29,250
Less: Interest expense (all fixed) 1,000 1,000
Net profits before taxes $ 9,000 $ 28,250
Less: Taxes (0.15 × net profits before taxes) 1,350 4,238
Net profits after taxes $ 7,650 $ 24,012
Breaking Vectra’s costs and expenses into fixed and variable components 
provides a more accurate projection of its pro forma profit. By assuming that all
costs are variable (as shown in Table 4.15), we find that projected net profits 
before taxes would continue to equal 9 percent of sales (in 2015, $9,000 net prof￾its before taxes ÷ $100,000 sales). Therefore, the 2016 net profits before taxes 
would have been $12,150 (0.09 × $135,000 projected sales) instead of the 
$28,250 obtained by using the firm’s fixed-cost–variable-cost breakdown.
Clearly, when using a simplified approach to prepare a pro forma income 
statement, we should break down costs and expenses into fixed and variable 
components.188 PART 2   Financial Tools

4.6 Preparing the Pro Forma Balance Sheet
A number of simplified approaches are available for preparing the pro forma 
balance sheet. One involves estimating all balance sheet accounts as a strict per￾centage of sales. A better and more popular approach is the judgmental approach,
under which the firm estimates the values of certain balance sheet accounts and 
uses its external financing as a balancing, or “plug,” figure. The judgmental 
approach represents an improved version of the percent-of-sales approach to pro 
forma balance sheet preparation. Because the judgmental approach requires only 
slightly more information and should yield better estimates than the somewhat 
naive percent-of-sales approach, it is presented here.
To apply the judgmental approach to prepare Vectra Manufacturing’s 2016 
pro forma balance sheet, a number of assumptions must be made about levels of 
various balance sheet accounts:
 1. A minimum cash balance of $6,000 is desired.
 2. Marketable securities will remain unchanged from their current level of 
$4,000.
 3. Accounts receivable on average represent about 45 days of sales (about 1/8 
of a year). Because Vectra’s annual sales are projected to be $135,000, 
accounts receivable should average $16,875 (1/8 × $135,000).
 4. The ending inventory should remain at a level of about $16,000, of which 
25 percent (approximately $4,000) should be raw materials and the re￾maining 75 percent (approximately $12,000) should consist of finished 
goods.
 5. A new machine costing $20,000 will be purchased. Total depreciation for the 
year is $8,000. Adding the $20,000 acquisition to the existing net fixed as￾sets of $51,000 and subtracting the depreciation of $8,000 yields net fixed 
assets of $63,000.
 6. Purchases will represent approximately 30 percent of annual sales, which in 
this case is approximately $40,500 (0.30 × $135,000). The firm estimates 
that it can take 73 days on average to satisfy its accounts payable. Thus ac￾counts payable should equal one-fifth (73 days ÷ 365 days) of the firm’s 
purchases, or $8,100 (1/5 × $40,500).
 7. Taxes payable will equal one-fourth of the current year’s tax liability, which 
equals $455 (one-fourth of the tax liability of $1,823 shown in the pro forma 
income statement in Table 4.15).
 8. Notes payable will remain unchanged from their current level of $8,300.
 9. No change in other current liabilities is expected. They remain at the level of 
the previous year: $3,400.

for Vectra Manufacturing (December 31, 2016)
 10. The firm’s long-term debt and its common stock will remain unchanged at 
$18,000 and $30,000, respectively; no issues, retirements, or repurchases of 
bonds or stocks are planned.
 11. Retained earnings will increase from the beginning level of $23,000 (from the 
balance sheet dated December 31, 2015, in Table 4.13) to $29,327. The in￾crease of $6,327 represents the amount of retained earnings calculated in the 
year-end 2016 pro forma income statement in Table 4.15.
A 2016 pro forma balance sheet for Vectra Manufacturing based on these 
assumptions is presented in Table 4.16. A “plug” figure—called the external 
financing required—of $8,293 is needed to bring the statement into balance. This 
means that the firm will have to obtain about $8,300 of additional external 
financing to support the increased sales level of $135,000 for 2016.
A positive value for “external financing required,” like that shown in Table 
4.16, means that, based on its plans, the firm will not generate enough internal 
financing to support its forecast growth in assets. To support the forecast level of 
operation, the firm must raise funds externally by using debt and/or equity fi￾nancing or by reducing dividends. Once the form of financing is determined, the 
pro forma balance sheet is modified to replace “external financing required” with 
the planned increases in the debt and/or equity accounts.
A negative value for “external financing required” indicates that, based on 
its plans, the firm will generate more financing internally than it needs to sup￾port its forecast growth in assets. In this case, funds are available for use in re￾paying debt, repurchasing stock, or increasing dividends. Once the specific 
actions are determined, “external financing required” is replaced in the pro 
forma balance sheet with the planned reductions in the debt and/or equity ac￾counts. Obviously, besides being used to prepare the pro forma balance sheet,

4.7 Evaluation of Pro Forma Statements
It is difficult to forecast the many variables involved in preparing pro forma 
statements. As a result, investors, lenders, and managers frequently use the 
techniques presented in this chapter to make rough estimates of pro forma fi￾nancial statements. It is nonetheless important to recognize the basic weak￾nesses of these simplified approaches. The weaknesses lie in two assumptions: 
(1) that the firm’s past financial condition is an accurate indicator of its future 
and (2) that certain variables (such as cash, accounts receivable, and invento￾ries) can be forced to take on certain “desired” values. These assumptions can￾not be justified solely on the basis of their ability to simplify the calculations 
involved. However, despite their weaknesses, the simplified approaches to pro 
forma statement preparation are likely to remain popular because of their rela￾tive simplicity. The widespread use of spreadsheets certainly helps to streamline 
the financial planning process.
However pro forma statements are prepared, analysts must understand how 
to use them to make financial decisions. Both financial managers and lenders can 
use pro forma statements to analyze the firm’s inflows and outflows of cash, as 
well as its liquidity, activity, debt, profitability, and market value. Various ratios 
can be calculated from the pro forma income statement and balance sheet to 
evaluate performance. Cash inflows and outflows can be evaluated by preparing 
a pro forma statement of cash flows. After analyzing the pro forma statements, 
the financial manager can take steps to adjust planned operations to achieve 
short-term financial goals. For example, if projected profits on the pro forma in￾come statement are too low, a variety of pricing and/or cost-cutting actions might 
be initiated. If the projected level of accounts receivable on the pro forma balance 
sheet is too high, changes in credit or collection policy may be called for. Pro 
forma statements are therefore of great importance in solidifying the firm’s finan￾cial plans for the coming year.

Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
Cash flow, the lifeblood of the firm, is a key determinant of the value of the 
firm. The financial manager must plan and manage the firm’s cash flow. The 
goal is to ensure the firm’s solvency and to generate positive cash flow for the 
firm’s owners. Both the magnitude and the risk of the cash flows generated on 
behalf of the owners determine the firm’s value.
To carry out the responsibility to create value for owners, the financial man￾ager uses tools such as cash budgets and pro forma financial statements as part 
of the process of generating positive cash flow. Good financial plans should re￾sult in large free cash flows. Clearly, the financial manager must deliberately 
and carefully plan and manage the firm’s cash flows to achieve the firm’s goal of 
maximizing share price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
LG 1 Understand tax depreciation procedures and the effect of depreciation on 
the firm’s cash flows. Depreciation is an important factor affecting a firm’s cash 
flow. An asset’s depreciable value and depreciable life are determined by using 
the MACRS standards in the federal tax code. MACRS groups assets (excluding 
real estate) into six property classes based on length of recovery period.
LG 2 Discuss the firm’s statement of cash flows, operating cash flow, and free 
cash flow. The statement of cash flows is divided into cash flow from operating, 
investment, and financing activities. It reconciles changes in the firm’s cash flows 
with changes in cash and marketable securities for the period. Interpreting the 
statement of cash flows involves both the major categories of cash flow and the 
individual items of cash inflow and outflow. From a strict financial point of 
view, a firm’s operating cash flow is defined to exclude interest. Of greater im￾portance is a firm’s free cash flow, which is the amount of cash flow available to 
creditors and owners.
LG 3 Understand the financial planning process, including long-term (strategic) 
financial plans and short-term (operating) financial plans. The two key aspects 
of the financial planning process are cash planning and profit planning. Cash 
planning involves the cash budget or cash forecast. Profit planning relies on the 
pro forma income statement and balance sheet. Long-term (strategic) financial 
plans act as a guide for preparing short-term (operating) financial plans. Long￾term plans tend to cover periods ranging from 2 to 10 years; short-term plans 
most often cover a 1- to 2-year period.
LG 4 Discuss the cash-planning process and the preparation, evaluation, and 
use of the cash budget. The cash-planning process uses the cash budget, based 
on a sales forecast, to estimate short-term cash surpluses and shortages. The 
cash budget is typically prepared for a 1-year period divided into months. It 
nets cash receipts and disbursements for each period to calculate net cash flow. 192 PART 2   Financial Tools
Ending cash is estimated by adding beginning cash to the net cash flow. By sub￾tracting the desired minimum cash balance from the ending cash, the firm can 
determine required total financing or the excess cash balance. To cope with un￾certainty in the cash budget, scenario analysis or simulation can be used. A firm 
must also consider its pattern of daily cash receipts and cash disbursements.
LG 5 Explain the simplified procedures used to prepare and evaluate the pro 
forma income statement and the pro forma balance sheet. A pro forma income 
statement can be developed by calculating past percentage relationships be￾tween certain cost and expense items and the firm’s sales and then applying 
these percentages to forecasts. Because this approach implies that all costs and 
expenses are variable, it tends to understate profits when sales are increasing 
and to overstate profits when sales are decreasing. This problem can be avoided 
by breaking down costs and expenses into fixed and variable components. In 
this case, the fixed components remain unchanged from the most recent year, 
and the variable costs and expenses are forecast on a percent-of-sales basis.
Under the judgmental approach, the values of certain balance sheet accounts 
are estimated and the firm’s external financing is used as a balancing, or “plug,” 
figure. A positive value for “external financing required” means that the firm will 
not generate enough internal financing to support its forecast growth in assets 
and will have to raise funds externally or reduce dividends. A negative value for 
“external financing required” indicates that the firm will generate more financing 
internally than it needs to support its forecast growth in assets and funds will be 
available for use in repaying debt, repurchasing stock, or increasing dividends.
LG 6 Evaluate the simplified approaches to pro forma financial statement prep￾aration and the common uses of pro forma statements. Simplified approaches 
for preparing pro forma statements assume that the firm’s past financial condi￾tion is an accurate indicator of the future. Pro forma statements are commonly 
used to forecast and analyze the firm’s level of profitability and overall financial 
performance so that adjustments can be made to planned operations to achieve 
short-term financial goals.

a. Calculate the annual depreciation for the asset purchase using the MACRS 
depreciation percentages in Table 4.2 on page 166.
b. Calculate the firm’s operating cash flows for each of the 6 years, using Equation

accruals had the following values at the start and end of the final year (year 6). 
Calculate the firm’s free cash flow (FCF) for that year.
 McDonald notes that, historically, 30% of sales have been for cash. Of credit sales,
70% are collected 1 month after the sale, and the remaining 30% are collected 
2 months after the sale. The firm wishes to maintain a minimum ending balance in 
its cash account of $25. Balances above this amount would be invested in short-term 
government securities (marketable securities), whereas any deficits would be 
financed through short-term bank borrowing (notes payable). The beginning cash 
balance at April 1 is $115.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
Accounting You need to understand time-value-of-money calculations to ac￾count for certain transactions such as loan amortization, lease payments, and 
bond interest rates.
informAtion SYStemS You need to understand time-value-of-money calcula￾tions to design systems that accurately measure and value the firm’s cash flows.
mAnAgement You need to understand time-value-of-money calculations so that 
you can manage cash receipts and disbursements in a way that will enable the 
firm to receive the greatest value from its cash flows.
mArketing You need to understand time value of money because funding for 
new programs and products must be justified financially using time-value-of￾money techniques.
operAtionS You need to understand time value of money because the value of 
investments in new equipment, in new processes, and in inventory will be affected 
by the time value of money.
In your personal life time-value-of-money techniques are widely 
used in personal financial planning. You can 
use them to calculate the value of savings at given future dates and to estimate the 
amount you need now to accumulate a given amount at a future date. You also 
can apply them to value lump-sum amounts or streams of periodic cash flows and 
to the interest rate or amount of time needed to achieve a given financial goal.209
Pay Me Now or Pay Me Later

n part due to a rather anemic economic recov￾ery, many state and local governments across 
the United States have recently faced budget short￾falls. The city of Cincinnati found an interesting 
way to help plug the hole in its budget. In March 
2013, the Cincinnati City Council voted five to 
four to hand over the management of 5,000 me￾tered parking spaces and seven parking lots and 
garages to a private company. In the deal, the city would give up the revenues it had been col￾lecting from parking fees. The private company would staff the lots and garages, and it would 
maintain and collect fees from the parking meters. In exchange for the right to run the city’s park￾ing operations, the company paid an up-front lump sum of $92 million to the city and promised to 
pay $3 million per year for the life of the deal (30 years).
Why did Cincinnati agree to such an arrangement? Perhaps it was because city leaders 
believe that the private company could run parking operations more efficiently than the city could. 
However, the deal was appealing, at least in part, because it allowed the city to accelerate its 
collection of parking revenues. Rather than collecting parking receipts as citizens paid them, 
Cincinnati received a large up-front payment along with a smaller annual stream of income. 
Cincinnati was not alone in making this decision. A few years earlier, Chicago had struck a similar 
deal, as had Indianapolis. New York had considered the idea but had rejected it.
How should city leaders evaluate such a proposal, which involves giving up a substantial 
stream of future income for (primarily) a lump sum payment? The answer lies in a concept known 
as the time value of money. The time value of money refers to a set of analytical tools that allows 
investors and other individuals to evaluate cash flows that arrive at different times in the future. At its 
most basic level, the time value of money simply recognizes that a dollar tomorrow is worth less 
than a dollar today because of the opportunity to earn interest. In other words, if you have a dollar 
today, you can invest it, and it will grow to more than a dollar in the future. The key issue for 
Cincinnati leaders to consider is whether the lump sum they received from the parking deal was 
worth more than the right to collect parking fees over time. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to make 
such a comparison.

5.1 The Role of Time Value in Finance
The time value of money refers to the observation that it is better to receive 
money sooner than later. Money that you have in hand today can be invested to 
earn a positive rate of return, producing more money tomorrow. For that reason, 
a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future. In business, managers 
constantly face trade-offs in situations in which actions that require outflows of 
cash today may produce inflows of cash later. Because the cash that comes in the 
future is worth less than the cash that firms spend up front, managers need a set 
of tools to help them compare cash inflows and outflows that occur at different 
times. This chapter introduces you to those tools.
FuTuRE VALuE VERSuS PRESENT VALuE
Suppose that a firm has an opportunity to spend $15,000 today on some invest￾ment that will produce $17,000 spread out over the next 5 years as follows:

time line
A horizontal line on which time 
zero appears at the leftmost end 
and future periods are marked 
from left to right; can be used to 
depict investment cash flows.
Is this investment a wise one? It might seem that the obvious answer is yes be￾cause the firm spends $15,000 and receives $17,000. Remember, though, that the 
value of the dollars the firm receives in the future is less than the value of the dol￾lars that they spend today. Therefore, it is not clear whether the $17,000 inflows 
are enough to justify the initial investment.
Time-value-of-money analysis helps managers answer questions like this one. 
The idea is that managers need a way to compare cash today versus cash in the fu￾ture. There are two ways of doing so. One way is to ask the question, What amount 
of money in the future is equivalent to $15,000 today? In other words, what is the 
future value of $15,000? The other approach asks, What amount today is equiva￾lent to $17,000 paid out over the next 5 years as outlined above? In other words, 
what is the present value of the stream of cash flows coming in the next 5 years?
A time line depicts the cash flows associated with a given investment. It is a 
horizontal line on which time zero appears at the leftmost end and future periods 
are marked from left to right. A time line illustrating our hypothetical investment 
problem appears in Figure 5.1. The cash flows occurring at time zero (today) and

at the end of each subsequent year are above the line; the negative values represent 
cash outflows ($15,000 invested today at time zero), and the positive values rep￾resent cash inflows ($3,000 inflow in 1 year, $5,000 inflow in 2 years, and so on).
To make the correct investment decision, managers need to compare the cash 
flows depicted in Figure 5.1 at a single point in time. Typically, that point is ei￾ther the end or the beginning of the investment’s life. The future value technique 
uses compounding to find the future value of each cash flow at the end of the in￾vestment’s life and then sums these values to find the investment’s future value. 
This approach is depicted above the time line in Figure 5.2. The figure shows that 
the future value of each cash flow is measured at the end of the investment’s 
5-year life. Alternatively, the present value technique uses discounting to find the 
present value of each cash flow at time zero and then sums these values to find 
the investment’s value today. Application of this approach is depicted below the 
time line in Figure 5.2. In practice, when making investment decisions, managers 
usually adopt the present value approach.
COMPuTATIONAL TOOLS
Finding present and future values can involve time-consuming calculations. Al￾though you should understand the concepts and mathematics underlying these 
calculations, financial calculators and spreadsheets streamline the application of 
time value techniques.
Financial Calculators
Financial calculators include numerous preprogrammed financial routines. 
Learning how to use these routines can make present and future values calcula￾tions a breeze.
We focus primarily on the keys pictured in Figure 5.3. We typically use four 
of the first five keys shown in the left column, along with the compute (CPT) key. 
One of the four keys represents the unknown value being calculated. The key￾strokes on some of the more sophisticated calculators are menu-driven: After you

select the appropriate routine, the calculator prompts you to input each value. 
Regardless, any calculator with the basic future and present value functions can 
simplify time-value-of-money calculations. The keystrokes for financial calcula￾tors are explained in the reference guides that accompany them.
Once you understand the underlying concepts, you probably will want to use 
a calculator to streamline calculations. With a little practice, you can increase 
both the speed and the accuracy of your financial computations. Remember that 
conceptual understanding of the material is the objective. An ability to solve 
problems with the aid of a calculator does not necessarily reflect such an under￾standing, so don’t just settle for answers. Work with the material until you are 
sure that you also understand the concepts.
Electronic Spreadsheets
Like financial calculators, electronic spreadsheets have built-in routines that sim￾plify time-value calculations. We provide in the text a number of spreadsheet solu￾tions that identify the cell entries for calculating time values. The value for each 
variable is entered in a cell in the spreadsheet, and the calculation is programmed 
using an equation that links the individual cells. Changing any of the input vari￾ables automatically changes the solution as a result of the equation linking the cells.
Cash Flow Signs
To provide a correct answer, financial calculators and electronic spreadsheets re￾quire that a calculation’s relevant cash flows be entered accurately as either cash 
inflows or cash outflows. Cash inflows are indicated by entering positive values, 
and cash outflows are indicated by entering negative values. By entering the cash 
flows correctly, you are providing the financial calculator or electronic spreadsheet 
the calculation’s time line. With accurate cash flows entered, answers provided by 
financial calculators or electronic spreadsheets will indicate the proper result.
BASIC PATTERNS OF CASh FLOW
The cash flow—both inflows and outflows—of a firm can be described by its gen￾eral pattern. It can be defined as a single amount, an annuity, or a mixed stream.
Single amount: A lump-sum amount either currently held or expected at some 
future date. Examples include $1,000 today and $650 to be received at the 
end of 10 years.
N — Number of periods
I — Interest rate per period

Annuity: A level periodic stream of cash flow. For our purposes, we’ll work 
primarily with annual cash flows. Examples include either paying out or re￾ceiving $800 at the end of each of the next 7 years.
Mixed stream: A stream of cash flow that is not an annuity; a stream of un￾equal periodic cash flows that reflect no particular pattern. Examples include 
the following two cash flow streams A and B.
Mixed cash flow stream
End of year A B
1 $ 100 −$ 50
2 800 100
3 1,200 80
4 1,200 −60
5 1,400  
6 300  
Note that neither cash flow stream has equal, periodic cash flows and that A 
is a 6-year mixed stream and B is a 4-year mixed stream.
In the next three sections of this chapter, we develop the concepts and tech￾niques for finding future and present values of single amounts, annuities, and 
mixed streams, respectively. Detailed demonstrations of these cash flow patterns 
are included.
➔ REVIEW QuESTIONS
5–1 What is the difference between future value and present value? Which 
approach is generally preferred by financial managers? Why?
5–2 Define and differentiate among the three basic patterns of cash flow: 
(1) a single amount, (2) an annuity, and (3) a mixed stream.
5.2 Single Amounts
Imagine that at age 25 you began investing $2,000 per year in an investment that earns 
5 percent interest. At the end of 40 years, at age 65, you would have invested a total of 
$80,000 (40 years 3 $2,000 per year). How much would you have accumulated at 
the end of the fortieth year? $100,000? $150,000? $200,000? No, your $80,000 
would have grown to $242,000! Why? Because the time value of money allowed your 
investments to generate returns that built on each other over the 40 years.
FuTuRE VALuE OF A SINGLE AMOuNT
The most basic future value and present value concepts and computations con￾cern single amounts, either present or future amounts. We begin by considering 
problems that involve finding the future value of cash that is on hand 
LG 2214 PART 2   Financial Tools
immediately. Then we will use the underlying concepts to solve problems that 
determine the value today of cash that will be received or paid in the future.
We often need to find the value at some future date of a given amount of 
money placed on deposit today. For example, if you deposit $500 today into an 
account that pays 5 percent annual interest, how much would you have in the 
account in 10 years? Future value is the value at a given future date of an amount 
placed on deposit today and earning interest at a specified rate. The future value 
depends on the rate of interest earned and the length of time the money is left on 
deposit. Here we explore the future value of a single amount.
The Concept of Future Value
We speak of compound interest to indicate that the amount of interest earned on 
a given deposit has become part of the principal at the end of a specified period. 
The term principal refers to the amount of money on which the interest is paid. 
Annual compounding is the most common type.
The future value of a present amount is found by applying compound interest
over a specified period of time. Savings institutions advertise compound interest 
returns at a rate of x percent, or x percent interest, compounded annually, semi￾annually, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, or even continuously. The concept of 
future value with annual compounding can be illustrated by a simple example.
If Fred Moreno places $100 in a savings account paying 8% 
interest compounded annually, at the end of 1 year he will 
have $108 in the account, which is the initial principal of $100 plus 8% ($8) in 
interest. The future value at the end of the first year is
Future value at end of year 1 = $100 * (1 + 0.08) = $108
If Fred were to leave this money in the account for another year, he would be 
paid interest at the rate of 8% on the new principal of $108. At the end of this 
second year, there would be $116.64 in the account. This amount would repre￾sent the principal at the beginning of year 2 ($108) plus 8% of the $108 ($8.64) 
in interest. The future value at the end of the second year is
Future value at end of year 2 = $108 * (1 + 0.08)
= $116.64
Substituting the expression $100 3 (1 1 0.08) from the first-year calculation 
for the $108 value in the second-year calculation gives us
Future value at end of year 2 = $100 * (1 + 0.08) * (1 + 0.08)
= $100 * (1 + 0.08)2
= $116.64
The equations in the preceding example lead to a more general formula for 
calculating future value.
The Equation for Future Value
The basic relationship illustrated in Example 5.1 can be generalized to find the 
future value after any number of periods. We use the following notation for the 
various inputs:
Personal Finance Example 5.1 ▶
future value 
The value at a given future date 
of an amount placed on 
deposit today and earning 
interest at a specified rate. 
Found by applying compound 
interest over a specified period

A simple example will illustrate how to apply Equation 5.1.
Jane Farber places $800 in a savings account paying 6% inter￾est compounded annually. She wants to know how much 
money will be in the account at the end of 5 years. Substituting
PV = $800, r = 0.06, and n = 5 into Equation 5.1 gives the amount at the end 
of year 5:
FV5 = $800 * (1 + 0.06)5 = $800 * (1.33823) = $1,070.58

1. Many calculators allow the user to set the number of payments per year. Most of these calculators are preset for 
monthly payments, or 12 payments per year. Because we work primarily with annual payments—one payment per 
year—it is important to be sure that your calculator is set for one payment per year. Although most calculators are 
preset to recognize that all payments occur at the end of the period, it is also important to make sure that your cal￾culator is correctly set on the END mode. To avoid including previous data in current calculations, always clear all 
registers of your calculator before inputting values and making each computation. The known values can be punched 
into the calculator in any order; the order specified in this as well as other demonstrations of calculator use included

$1,070.58 should appear on the calculator display as shown at the left. Re￾member that the calculator differentiates inflows from outflows by preceding 
the outflows with a negative sign. For example, in the problem just demon￾strated, the $800 present value (PV), because it was keyed as a negative num￾ber, is considered an outflow. Therefore, the calculated future value (FV) of 
1,070.58 is shown as a positive number to indicate that it is the resulting in￾flow. Had the $800 present value been keyed as a positive number (800), the 
future value of $1,070.58 would have been displayed as a negative number 
(–1,070.58). Simply stated, the cash flows—present value (PV) and future value 
(FV)—will have opposite signs. (Note: In future examples of calculator use, we 
will use only a display similar to that shown here. If you need a reminder of the 
procedures involved, review this paragraph.)
Spreadsheet use Excel offers a mathematical function that makes the calculation 
of future values easy. The format of that function is FV(rate,nper,pmt,pv,type). 
The terms inside the parentheses are inputs that Excel requires to calculate the 
future value. The terms rate and nper refer to the interest rate and the number of 
time periods, respectively. The term pv represents the lump sum (or present value) 
that you are investing today. For now, we will ignore the other two inputs, pmt
and type, and enter a value of zero. The future value of the single amount also 
can be calculated as shown on the following Excel spreadsheet.

Changing any of the values in cells B2, B3, or B4 automatically changes the 
result shown in cell B5 because the formula in that cell links back to the others. As 
with the calculator, Excel reports cash inflows as positive numbers and cash out￾flows as negative numbers. In the example here, we have entered the $800 present 
value as a negative number, which causes Excel to report the future value as a 
positive number. Logically, Excel treats the $800 present value as a cash outflow, 
as if you are paying for the investment you are making, and it treats the future 
value as a cash inflow when you reap the benefits of your investment 5 years later.
A Graphical View of Future Value
Remember that we measure future value at the end of the given period. Figure 5.4 
illustrates how the future value depends on the interest rate and the number of 
periods that money is invested. It shows that (1) the higher the interest rate, the 
higher the future value, and (2) the longer the period of time, the higher the fu￾ture value. Note that for an interest rate of 0 percent, the future value always 
equals the present value ($1.00). For any interest rate greater than zero, however, 
the future value is greater than the present value of $1.00.ChAPTER 5   Time Value of Money 217
PRESENT VALuE OF A SINGLE AMOuNT
It is often useful to determine the value today of a future amount of money. For 
example, how much would I have to deposit today into an account paying 7 per￾cent annual interest to accumulate $3,000 at the end of 5 years? Present value is 
the current dollar value of a future amount, or the amount of money that would 
have to be invested today at a given interest rate over a specified period to equal 
the future amount. Like future value, the present value depends largely on the 
interest rate and the point in time at which the amount is to be received. This sec￾tion explores the present value of a single amount.
The Concept of Present Value
The process of finding present values is often referred to as discounting cash 
flows. It is concerned with answering the following question: If I can earn r per￾cent on my money, what is the most I would be willing to pay now for an oppor￾tunity to receive FVn
 dollars n periods from today?
This process is actually the inverse of compounding interest. Instead of find￾ing the future value of present dollars invested at a given rate, discounting deter￾mines the present value of a future amount, assuming an opportunity to earn a 
certain return on the money. This annual rate of return is variously referred to as 
the discount rate, required return, cost of capital, and opportunity cost. These 
terms will be used interchangeably in this text.
Paul Shorter has an opportunity to receive $300 one year from 
now. If he can earn 6% on his investments in the normal 
course of events, what is the most he should pay now for this opportunity? To 
answer this question, Paul must determine how many dollars he would have to 
invest at 6% today to have $300 one year. Letting PV equal this unknown 
amount and using the same notation as in the future value discussion, we have
PV * (1 + 0.06) = $300

The value today (“present value”) of $300 received 1 year from today, given

result in $300 at the end of 1 year.
The Equation for Present Value
The present value of a future amount can be found mathematically by solving 
Equation 5.1 for PV. In other words, the present value, PV, of some future 
amount, FVn, to be received n periods from now, assuming an interest rate (or

A Graphical View of Present Value
Remember that present value calculations assume that the future values are mea￾sured at the end of the given period. The relationships among the factors in a 
present value calculation are illustrated in Figure 5.5. The figure clearly shows 
that, everything else being equal, (1) the higher the discount rate, the lower the 
present value, and (2) the longer the period of time, the lower the present value. 
Also note that given a discount rate of 0 percent, the present value always equals 
the future value ($1.00). But for any discount rate greater than zero, the present 
value is less than the future value of $1.00.

5.3 Annuities
How much would you pay today, given that you can earn 7 percent on low-risk 
investments, to receive a guaranteed $3,000 at the end of each of the next 
20 years? How much will you have at the end of 5 years if your employer with￾holds and invests $1,000 of your bonus at the end of each of the next 5 years, 
guaranteeing you a 9 percent annual rate of return? To answer these questions, 
you need to understand the application of the time value of money to annuities.
An annuity is a stream of equal periodic cash flows, over a specified time 
period. These cash flows are usually annual but can occur at other intervals, such 
as monthly rent or car payments. The cash flows in an annuity can be inflows
(the $3,000 received at the end of each of the next 20 years) or outflows (the 
$1,000 invested at the end of each of the next 5 years).
TYPES OF ANNuITIES
There are two general types of annuities. For an ordinary annuity, the cash flow 
occurs at the end of each period. For an annuity due, the cash flow occurs at the 
beginning of each period. 
Fran Abrams is evaluating two annuities. Both are 5-year, 
$1,000 annuities; annuity A is an ordinary annuity, and annu￾ity B is an annuity due. To better understand the difference between these annui￾ties, she has listed their cash flows in Table 5.1. The two annuities differ only in 
the timing of their cash flows: The cash flows occur sooner with the annuity due 
than with the ordinary annuity.
Personal Finance Example 5.6 ▶

5 1,000 0
Totals $5,000 $5,000
TABLE 5.1ChAPTER 5   Time Value of Money 221
Although the cash flows of both annuities in Table 5.1 total $5,000, the an￾nuity due would have a higher future value than the ordinary annuity because 
each of its five annual cash flows can earn interest for 1 year more than each of 
the ordinary annuity’s cash flows. In general, as will be demonstrated later in this 
chapter, the value (present or future) of an annuity due is always greater than the 
value of an otherwise identical ordinary annuity.
Because ordinary annuities are more frequently used in finance, unless other￾wise specified, the term annuity is intended throughout this book to refer to ordi￾nary annuities.
FINdING ThE FuTuRE VALuE OF AN ORdINARY ANNuITY
One way to find the future value of an ordinary annuity is to calculate the future 
value of each of the individual cash flows and then add up those figures. Fortu￾nately, there are several shortcuts to get to the answer. You can calculate the fu￾ture value of an ordinary annuity that pays an annual cash flow equal to CF by 
using Equation 5.3:
FVn = CF * e
3 (1 + r)
n - 14
r
f (5.3)
As before, in this equation r represents the interest rate, and n represents the 
number of payments in the annuity (or, equivalently, the number of years over 
which the annuity is spread). The calculations required to find the future value of 
an ordinary annuity are illustrated in the following example.
Fran Abrams wishes to determine how much money she will 
have at the end of 5 years if she chooses annuity A, the ordinary 
annuity. She will deposit $1,000 annually, at the end of each of the next 
5 years, into a savings account paying 7% annual interest. This situation is 
depicted on the following time line.

IRF222 PART 2   Financial Tools
deposit will earn interest for 4 years, the second for 3 years, and so on. Plugging 
the relevant values into Equation 5.3, we have
FV5 = $1,000 * e
3 (1 + 0.07)5 - 14
0.07 f = $5,750.74
Calculator use Using the calculator inputs shown at the left, you can confirm 
that the future value of the ordinary annuity equals $5,750.74. In this example, 
the $1,000 annuity payment is entered as a negative value because it is cash out￾flow, which in turn causes the calculator to correctly treat the resulting future 
value as a cash inflow (that is, the investment’s payoff).
Spreadsheet use To calculate the future value of an annuity in Excel, we will use 
the same future value function that we used to calculate the future value of a lump 
sum, but we will add two new input values. Recall that the future value function’s 
syntax is FV(rate,nper,pmt,pv,type). We have already explained the terms rate, 
nper, and pv in this function. The term pmt refers to the annual payment that the 
annuity offers. The term type is an input that lets Excel know whether the annuity 
being valued is an ordinary annuity (in which case the input value for type is 0 or 
omitted) or an annuity due (in which case the correct input value for type is 1). In 
this particular problem, the input value for pv is 0 or omitted because there is no 
up-front money received. The only cash flows are those that are part of the annuity 
stream. The future value of the ordinary annuity can be calculated as shown on the 
following Excel spreadsheet.
FINdING ThE PRESENT VALuE OF AN ORdINARY ANNuITY
Quite often in finance, there is a need to find the present value of a stream of cash 
flows to be received in future periods. An annuity is, of course, a stream of equal 
periodic cash flows. The method for finding the present value of an ordinary an￾nuity is similar to the method just discussed. One approach would be to calculate 
the present value of each cash flow in the annuity and then add up those present 
values. Alternatively, the algebraic shortcut for finding the present value of an

FINdING ThE FuTuRE VALuE OF AN ANNuITY duE
We now turn our attention to annuities due. Remember that the cash flows of an 
annuity due occur at the start of the period. In other words, if we are dealing with 
annual payments, each payment in an annuity due comes 1 year earlier than it 
would in an ordinary annuity, which in turn means that each payment can earn 
an extra year’s worth of interest. That is why the future value of an annuity due 
exceeds the future value of an otherwise identical ordinary annuity.

Compare this equation with Equation 5.3 on page 221, which shows how to 
calculate the future value of an ordinary annuity. The two equations are nearly 
identical, but Equation 5.5 has an added term, (1 + r), at the end. In other words, 
the value obtained from Equation 5.5 will be (1 + r) times greater than the value 
in Equation 5.3 if the other inputs (CF and n) are the same, and that makes sense 
because all the payments in the annuity due earn 1 more year’s worth of interest 
compared with the ordinary annuity.
Recall from an earlier example, illustrated in Table 5.1 on 
page 220, that Fran Abrams wanted to choose between an or￾dinary annuity and an annuity due, both offering similar terms except for the 
timing of cash flows. We calculated the future value of the ordinary annuity in 
Example 5.7, but we now want to calculate the future value of the annuity due. 
This situation is depicted on the time line on the following page. We can calculate 
its future value using a calculator or a spreadsheet.

Comparison of an Annuity due with an Ordinary Annuity Future Value
The future value of an annuity due is always greater than the future value of an 
otherwise identical ordinary annuity. We can see that by comparing the future 
values at the end of year 5 of Fran Abrams’s two annuities:
Ordinary annuity = $5,750.74 versus Annuity due = $6,153.29
Because the cash flow of the annuity due occurs at the beginning of the period rather 
than at the end (that is, each payment comes 1 year sooner in the annuity due), its 
future value is greater. How much greater? It is interesting to calculate the percentage 
difference between the value of the annuity and the value of the annuity due:
($6,153.29 - $5,750.74) , $5,750.74 = 0.07 = 7,
Recall that the interest rate in this example is 7 percent. It is no coincidence 
that the annuity due is 7 percent more valuable than the annuity. An extra year’s 
interest on each of the annuity due’s payments make the annuity due 7 percent 
more valuable than the annuity.

more, 1 year’s interest more.

Comparison of an Annuity due with an Ordinary Annuity Present Value
The present value of an annuity due is always greater than the present value of an 
otherwise identical ordinary annuity. We can verify this statement by comparing 
the present values of the Braden Company’s two annuities:
Ordinary annuity 5 $2,794.90 versus Annuity due 5 $3,018.49
Because the cash flow of the annuity due occurs at the beginning of the period 
rather than at the end, its present value is greater. If we calculate the percentage 
difference in the values of these two annuities, we will find that the annuity due is 
8 percent more valuable than the annuity:
($3,018.49 - $2,794.90) , $2,794.90 = 0.08 = 8,

5.4 Mixed Streams
Two types of cash flow streams are possible, the annuity and the mixed stream. 
Whereas an annuity is a pattern of equal periodic cash flows, a mixed stream is a 
stream of unequal periodic cash flows that reflect no particular pattern. Financial 
managers frequently need to evaluate opportunities that are expected to provide 
mixed streams of cash flows. Here we consider both the future value and the 
present value of mixed streams.
FuTuRE VALuE OF A MIxEd STREAM
Determining the future value of a mixed stream of cash flows is straightforward. 
We determine the future value of each cash flow at the specified future date and 
then add all the individual future values to find the total future value.

If Shrell expects to earn 8% on its investments, how much will it accumulate by 
the end of year 5 if it immediately invests these cash flows when they are re￾ceived? This situation is depicted on the following time line.
Calculator use Unfortunately, unless you can program your calculator or have 
one of the more advanced financial calculators, most calculators lack a function 
that would allow you to input all the cash flows, specify the interest rate, and 
directly calculate the future value of the entire cash flow stream. Fortunately, 
there is a way to overcome this limitation. Use your calculator to find the future 
value of each individual cash flow, as demonstrated earlier (in Personal Finance 
Example 5.3 on page 215), and then sum the individual future values to get the 
future value of the entire cash flow stream. Summing the individual future values 
of Shrell Industries’ mixed cash flow stream results in a future value of $83,608.15 
at the end of year 5.
Spreadsheet use A relatively simple way to use Excel to calculate the future value 
of a mixed stream is to use the Excel net present value (NPV) function combined 
with the future value (FV) function discussed on page 216. The syntax of the 
NPV function is NPV(rate, value1, value2, value 3, . . .). The rate argument is the 
interest rate, and value1, value2, value3, . . . represent a stream of cash flows. 
The NPV function assumes that the first payment in the stream arrives 1 year in 
the future and that all subsequent payments arrive at 1-year intervals.
To find the future value of a mixed stream, the trick is to use the NPV func￾tion to first find the present value of the mixed stream and then find the future of 
this present value lump sum amount. The Excel spreadsheet at the top of the next 
page illustrates this approach (notice that the NPV is shown as an outflow be￾cause it represents the net present value of the stream of investment costs).

SEMIANNuAL COMPOuNdING
Semiannual compounding of interest involves two compounding periods within 
the year. Instead of the stated interest rate being paid once a year, one-half of the 
stated interest rate is paid twice a year.
Fred Moreno has decided to invest $100 in a savings ac￾count paying 8% interest compounded semiannually. If he 
leaves his money in the account for 24 months (2 years), he will be paid 4% inter￾est compounded over four periods, each of which is 6 months long. Table 5.3 
shows that at the end of 12 months (1 year) with 8% semiannual compounding, 
Fred will have $108.16; at the end of 24 months (2 years), he will have $116.99.
Personal Finance Example 5.14 ▶

QuARTERLY COMPOuNdING
Quarterly compounding of interest involves four compounding periods within 
the year. One-fourth of the stated interest rate is paid four times a year.
Fred Moreno has found an institution that will pay him 8% 
interest compounded quarterly. If he leaves his money in this 
account for 24 months (2 years), he will be paid 2% interest compounded over 
eight periods, each of which is 3 months long. Table 5.4 shows the amount Fred 
will have at the end of each period. At the end of 12 months (1 year), with 8% 
quarterly compounding, Fred will have $108.24; at the end of 24 months 
(2 years), he will have $117.17.

Table 5.5 compares values for Fred Moreno’s $100 at the end of years 1 and 2

the amount of money accumulated. This statement is true for any interest rate for 
any period of time.
A GENERAL EQuATION FOR COMPOuNdING MORE 
FREQuENTLY ThAN ANNuALLY
The future value formula (Equation 5.1) can be rewritten for use when com￾pounding takes place more frequently. If m equals the number of times per year 
interest is compounded, the formula for the future value of a lump sum becomes
FVn = PV * a1 +
r
m
b
m*n
(5.8)
If m = 1, Equation 5.8 reduces to Equation 5.1. Thus, if interest compounds 
annually, Equation 5.8 will provide the same result as Equation 5.1. The general 
use of Equation 5.8 can be illustrated with a simple example.
The preceding examples calculated the amount that Fred 
Moreno would have at the end of 2 years if he deposited 
$100 at 8% interest compounded semiannually and compounded quarterly. For 
semiannual compounding, m would equal 2 in Equation 5.8; for quarterly com￾pounding, m would equal 4. Substituting the appropriate values for semiannual 
and quarterly compounding into Equation 5.7, we find that
 1. For semiannual compounding:
FV2 = $100 * a1 +
0.08
2
b
2*2
= $100 * (1 + 0.04)4 = $116.99
 2. For quarterly compounding:
FV2 = $100 * a1 +
0.08
4
b
4*2
= $100 * (1 + 0.02)8 = $117.17
These results agree with the values for FV2
 in Tables 5.4 and 5.5.
If the interest were compounded monthly, weekly, or daily, m would equal 12, 
52, or 365, respectively.

In the extreme case, interest can be compounded continuously. In this case interest is

expected, the continuously compounded value is larger than the future value of 
interest compounded semiannually ($116.99) or quarterly ($117.17). In fact, 
continuous compounding produces a greater future value than any other com￾pounding frequency.
NOMINAL ANd EFFECTIVE ANNuAL RATES OF INTEREST
Both businesses and investors need to make objective comparisons of loan costs 
or investment returns over different compounding periods. To put interest rates 
on a common basis, so as to allow comparison, we distinguish between nominal 
and effective annual rates. The nominal, or stated, annual rate is the contractual 
annual rate of interest charged by a lender or promised by a borrower. The effec￾tive, or true, annual rate (EAR) is the annual rate of interest actually paid or 
earned. The effective annual rate reflects the effects of compounding frequency, 
whereas the nominal annual rate does not.
Using the notation introduced earlier, we can calculate the effective annual 
rate, EAR, by substituting values for the nominal annual rate, r, and the com￾pounding frequency, m, into the equation

Calculator use To find the EAR using the calculator, you first need to enter the 
nominal annual rate and the compounding frequency per year. Most financial 
calculators have a NOM key for entering the nominal rate and either a P/Y or 
C/Y key for entering the compounding frequency per year. Once these inputs 
are entered, the EFF or CPT key is depressed to display the corresponding effec￾tive annual rate.
Spreadsheet use Interest rate conversions are easily done using Excel using the 
EFFECT and NOMINAL functions. To find the EAR, the EFFECT function re￾quires you to input nominal annual rate and the compounding frequency, whereas 
if you input an EAR and the compounding frequency, the NOMINAL function 
provides the nominal annual rate or APR. Interest rate conversions from the 8% 
APR to the semiannual EAR and from the quarterly EAR back to the 8% APR
are shown on the following Excel spreadsheet.

These values demonstrate two important points. First, nominal and effective

rate increases with increasing compounding frequency, up to a limit that occurs 
with continuous compounding.3
For an EAR example related to the “payday loan” business, with discussion 
of the ethical issues involved, see the Focus on Ethics box.
At the consumer level, “truth-in-lending laws” require disclosure on credit 
card and loan agreements of the annual percentage rate (APR). The APR is the 
nominal annual rate, which is found by multiplying the periodic rate by the number 
of periods in 1 year. For example, a bank credit card that charges 1.5 percent per 
month (the periodic rate) would have an APR of 18 percent (1.5% per month *
12 months per year).
“Truth-in-savings laws,” on the other hand, require banks to quote the 
annual percentage yield (APY) on their savings products. The APY is the effective 
annual rate a savings product pays. For example, a savings account that pays 
0.5 percent per month would have an APY of 6.17 percent 3 (1.005)12 - 14 .
Quoting loan interest rates at their lower nominal annual rate (the APR) and 
savings interest rates at the higher effective annual rate (the APY) offers two ad￾vantages. First, it tends to standardize disclosure to consumers. Second, it enables 
financial institutions to quote the most attractive interest rates: low loan rates 
and high savings rates.

 5.6 Special Applications of Time Value
Future value and present value techniques have a number of important applica￾tions in finance. We’ll study four of them in this section: (1) determining deposits 
needed to accumulate a future sum, (2) loan amortization, (3) finding interest or 
growth rates, and (4) finding an unknown number of periods.
In 1993, the first 
Check Into Cash loca￾tion opened in Cleveland, Tennessee. 
Today, there are more than 1,100 
Check Into Cash centers among an esti￾mated 22,000 payday-advance lend￾ers in the United States. There is no 
doubt about the demand for such orga￾nizations, but the debate continues on 
the “fairness” of payday-advance loans.
A payday loan is a small, unse￾cured, short-term loan ranging from 
$100 to $1,000 (depending on the 
state) offered by a payday lender such 
as Check Into Cash. A payday loan 
can solve temporary cash flow prob￾lems without bouncing a check or incur￾ring late-payment penalties. To receive 
a payday advance, borrowers simply 
write a personal post-dated check for 
the amount they wish to borrow, plus 
the payday loan fee. Check Into Cash 
holds their checks until payday when 
the loans are either paid off in person 
or the check is presented to the borrow￾ers’ bank for payment.
Although payday-advance borrow￾ers usually pay a flat fee in lieu of inter￾est, it is the size of the fee in relation to 
the amount borrowed that is particularly 
aggravating to opponents of the 
payday-advance industry. A typical fee 
is $15 for every $100 borrowed. Pay￾day advance companies that belong to 
the Community Financial Services Asso￾ciation of America, an organization 
dedicated to promoting responsible reg￾ulation of the industry, limit their member 
companies to a maximum of four roll￾overs of the original amount borrowed. 
Thus, a borrower who rolled over an 
initial $100 loan for the maximum of 
four times would accumulate a total of 
$75 in fees, all within a 10-week 
period. On an annualized basis, the 
fees would amount to a whopping 
391 percent.
An annual rate of 391 percent is 
a huge cost in relation to interest 
charged on home equity loans, per￾sonal loans, and even credit cards. 
However, advocates of the payday￾advance industry make the following 
arguments: Most payday loan recipi￾ents do so either because funds are 
unavailable through conventional 
loans or because the payday loan 
averts a penalty or bank fee, which 
is, in itself, onerous. According to 
Check Into Cash, the cost for $100 of 
overdraft protection is $26.90, a 
credit card late fee on $100 is $37, 
and the late/disconnect fee on a 
$100 utility bill is $46.16. Bankrate
.com reports that nonsufficient funds 
(NSF) fees average $26.90 per 
occurrence.
A payday advance could be use￾ful, for example, if you have six out￾standing checks at the time you are 
notified that the first check has been 
returned for insufficient funds (NSF) and 
you have been charged an NSF fee of 
$26. A payday advance could poten￾tially avert subsequent charges of 
$26 per check for each of the remain￾ing five checks and allow you time to 
rearrange your finances. When used 
judiciously, a payday advance can be 
a viable option to meet a short-term 
cash flow problem despite its high 
cost. Used unwisely, or by someone 
who continuously relies on a payday 
loan to try to make ends meet, payday 
advances can seriously harm one’s 
personal finances.
▶ The 391 percent mentioned 
above is an annual nominal rate 
[15% 3 (365 4 14)]. Should the 
2-week rate (15 percent) be com￾pounded to calculate the effective 
annual interest rate?

dETERMINING dEPOSITS NEEdEd TO ACCuMuLATE 
A FuTuRE SuM
Suppose that you want to buy a house 5 years from now, and you estimate that 
an initial down payment of $30,000 will be required at that time. To accumu￾late the $30,000, you will wish to make equal annual end-of-year deposits into 
an account paying annual interest of 6 percent. The solution to this problem is 
closely related to the process of finding the future value of an annuity. You 
must determine what size annuity will result in a single amount equal to $30,000 
at the end of year 5.
Earlier in the chapter, Equation 5.3 was provided for the future value of an 
ordinary annuity that made a payment, CF, each year. In the current problem, we 
know the future value we want to achieve, $30,000, but we want to solve for the 
annual cash payment that we’d have to save to achieve that goal. Solving Equation 
5.3 for CF gives
CF = FVn , e
3 (1 + r)
n - 14
r
f (5.11)
As a practical matter, to solve problems like this one, analysts nearly always 
use a calculator or Excel as demonstrated in the following example.
As just stated, you want to determine the equal annual end￾of-year deposits required to accumulate $30,000 at the end of 
5 years, given an interest rate of 6%.
Calculator use Using the calculator inputs shown at the left, you will find the an￾nual deposit amount to be $5,321.89. Thus, if $5,321.89 is deposited at the end 
of each year for 5 years at 6% interest, there will be $30,000 in the account at the 
end of 5 years.
Spreadsheet use In Excel, solving for the annual cash flow that helps you reach the 
$30,000 means using the payment function. Its syntax is PMT (rate,nper,pv, 
fv,type). All the inputs in this function have been discussed previously. The follow￾ing Excel spreadsheet illustrates how to use this function to find the annual pay￾ment required to save $30,000.

LOAN AMORTIZATION
The term loan amortization refers to the determination of equal periodic loan 
payments. These payments provide a lender with a specified interest return 
and repay the loan principal over a specified period. The loan amortization 
process involves finding the future payments, over the term of the loan, whose 
present value at the loan interest rate equals the amount of initial principal 
borrowed. Lenders use a loan amortization schedule to determine these pay￾ment amounts and the allocation of each payment to interest and principal. In 
the case of home mortgages, these tables are used to find the equal monthly
payments necessary to amortize, or pay off, the mortgage at a specified inter￾est rate over a 15- to 30-year period.
Amortizing a loan actually involves creating an annuity out of a present 
amount. For example, say you borrow $6,000 at 10 percent and agree to make 
equal annual end-of-year payments over 4 years. To find the size of the payments, 
the lender determines the amount of a 4-year annuity discounted at 10 percent 
that has a present value of $6,000.
Earlier in the chapter, Equation 5.4 demonstrated how to find the present 
value of an ordinary annuity given information about the number of time peri￾ods, the interest rate, and the annuity’s periodic payment. We can rearrange that 
equation to solve for the payment, our objective in this problem:
loan amortization

periodic loan payments 
necessary to provide a lender 
with a specified interest return 
and to repay the loan principal 
over a specified period.

As just stated, you want to determine the equal annual end-of￾year payments necessary to amortize fully a $6,000, 10% loan 
over 4 years.
Calculator use Using the calculator inputs shown at the left, you will find the an￾nual payment amount to be $1,892.82. Thus, to repay the interest and principal 
on a $6,000, 10%, 4-year loan, equal annual end-of-year payments of $1,892.82 
are necessary.
The allocation of each loan payment to interest and principal can be seen in 
columns 3 and 4 of the loan amortization schedule in Table 5.6. The portion of 
each payment that represents interest (column 3) declines over the repayment 
period, and the portion going to principal repayment (column 4) increases. This 
pattern is typical of amortized loans; as the principal is reduced, the interest com￾ponent declines, leaving a larger portion of each subsequent loan payment to re￾pay principal.
Spreadsheet use The annual payment to repay the loan also can be calculated as 
shown on the first Excel spreadsheet shown on page 241. The amortization 
schedule, shown in Table 5.6, allocating each loan payment to interest and prin￾cipal can be calculated precisely as shown on the second Excel spreadsheet on

As the housing market 
began to boom at the 
end of the twentieth century and into 
the early twenty-first, the market share 
of subprime mortgages climbed from 
near 0 percent in 1997 to about 
20 percent of mortgage originations in 
2006. Several factors combined to 
fuel the rapid growth of lending to bor￾rowers with tarnished credit, including 
a low interest rate environment, loose 
underwriting standards, and innova￾tions in mortgage financing such as 
“affordability programs” to increase 
rates of homeownership among lower￾income borrowers.

option for many subprime borrowers. In￾stead, borrowers in trouble could try to 
convince their lenders to allow a “short 
sale,” in which the borrower sells the 
home for whatever the market will bear 
and the lender agrees to accept the 
proceeds from that sale as settlement for 
the mortgage debt. For lenders and bor￾rowers alike, foreclosure is the last, 
worst option.

In other words, he wishes to determine how many years, n, it will take to re￾pay the $25,000, 11% loan, PVn
, if the payments of $4,800 are made at the 
end of each year.
Calculator use (Note: Most calculators require either the PV or the PMT value 
to be input as a negative number to calculate an unknown number of periods. 
That approach is used here.) Using the inputs shown at the left, you will find the 
number of periods to be 8.15 years. So, after making 8 payments of $4,800, Bill 
will still have a small outstanding balance.
Spreadsheet use The number of years to pay off the loan also can be calculated as 
shown on the following Excel spreadsheet.

Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
Time value of money is an important tool that financial managers and other mar￾ket participants use to assess the effects of proposed actions. Because firms have 
long lives and some decisions affect their long-term cash flows, the effective appli￾cation of time-value-of-money techniques is extremely important. These tech￾niques enable financial managers to evaluate cash flows occurring at different 
times so as to combine, compare, and evaluate them and link them to the firm’s

overall goal of share price maximization. It will become clear in Chapters 6 and 7 
that the application of time value techniques is a key part of the value determina￾tion process needed to make intelligent value-creating decisions.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
LG 1 Discuss the role of time value in finance, the use of computational tools, 
and the basic patterns of cash flow. Financial managers and investors use time￾value-of-money techniques when assessing the value of expected cash flow 
streams. Alternatives can be assessed by either compounding to find future 
value or discounting to find present value. Financial managers rely primarily 
on present value techniques. Financial calculators, electronic spreadsheets, and 
financial tables can streamline the application of time value techniques. The 
cash flow of a firm can be described by its pattern: single amount, annuity, or 
mixed stream.
LG 2 Understand the concepts of future value and present value, their calcula￾tion for single amounts, and the relationship between them. Future value (FV) 
relies on compound interest to measure future amounts. The initial principal or 
deposit in one period, along with the interest earned on it, becomes the begin￾ning principal of the following period.
The present value (PV) of a future amount is the amount of money today 
that is equivalent to the given future amount, considering the return that can be 
earned. Present value is the inverse of future value.
LG 3
Find the future value and the present value of both an ordinary annuity 
and an annuity due, and find the present value of a perpetuity. An annuity is a 
pattern of equal periodic cash flows. For an ordinary annuity, the cash flows 
occur at the end of the period. For an annuity due, cash flows occur at the be￾ginning of the period.
The future or present value of an ordinary annuity can be found by using 
algebraic equations, a financial calculator, or a spreadsheet program. The value 
of an annuity due is always r% greater than the value of an identical annuity. 
The present value of a perpetuity—an infinite-lived annuity—equals the annual 
cash payment divided by the discount rate.
LG 4 Calculate both the future value and the present value of a mixed stream 
of cash flows. A mixed stream of cash flows is a stream of unequal periodic cash 
flows that reflect no particular pattern. The future value of a mixed stream of 
cash flows is the sum of the future values of each individual cash flow. Similarly, 
the present value of a mixed stream of cash flows is the sum of the present val￾ues of the individual cash flows.
LG 5 Understand the effect that compounding interest more frequently than 
annually has on future value and on the effective annual rate of interest. Inter￾est can be compounded at intervals ranging from annually to daily and even 
continuously. The more often interest is compounded, the larger the future 
amount that will be accumulated, and the higher the effective, or true, annual 
rate (EAR).ChAPTER 5   Time Value of Money 247
The annual percentage rate (APR)—a nominal annual rate—is quoted on 
credit cards and loans. The annual percentage yield (APY)—an effective annual 
rate—is quoted on savings products.
LG 6 Describe the procedures involved in (1) determining deposits needed to 
accumulate a future sum, (2) loan amortization, (3) finding interest or growth 
rates, and (4) finding an unknown number of periods. (1) The periodic deposit 
to accumulate a given future sum can be found by solving the equation for the 
future value of an annuity for the annual payment. (2) A loan can be amortized 
into equal periodic payments by solving the equation for the present value of an 
annuity for the periodic payment. (3) Interest or growth rates can be estimated 
by finding the unknown interest rate in the equation for the present value of a 
single amount or an annuity. (4) The number of periods can be estimated by 
finding the unknown number of periods in the equation for the present value of 
a single amount or an annuity.
Opener-in-Review
The chapter opener described an arrangement in which the city of Cincinnati 
gave up the right to collect parking fees over a 30-year period in exchange for a 
lump sum of $92 million plus a 30-year annuity of $3 million. Suppose that if 
the city had not entered into that arrangement, it would have collected parking 
fees the following year of $6 million (net of operating costs), and those fees 
would have grown at a steady 3% for the next 30 years. At an interest rate of 
4%, what is the present value of the parking revenue that the city could have 
collected? Using the same 4% to value the payments that the city was set to re￾ceive in their privatization deal, do you think that the city made the correct deci￾sion? Why or why not?

Lee was so pleased with the amount of useful and interesting knowledge she gained 
that she convinced her parents, who were wealthy alumni of the university she was 
attending, to create an endowment. The endowment is to allow three needy students 
to take the introductory finance course each year in perpetuity. The guaranteed an￾nual cost of tuition and books for the course is $600 per student. The endowment 
will be created by making a single payment to the university. The university expects 
to earn exactly 6% per year on these funds.

 At the end of 2015, Uma Corporation is considering undertaking a major long-term 
project in an effort to remain competitive in its industry. The production and sales 
departments have determined the potential annual cash flow savings that could accrue 
to the firm if it acts soon. Specifically, they estimate that a mixed stream of future 
cash flow savings will occur at the end of the years 2016 through 2021. The years 
2022 through 2026 will see consecutive and equal cash flow savings at the end of 
each year. The firm estimates that its discount rate over the first 6 years will be 7%. 
The expected discount rate over the years 2022 through 2026 will be 11%.
The project managers will find the project acceptable if it results in present cash 
flow savings of at least $860,000. The following cash flow savings data are supplied

Although Track experienced losses during its first 2 years of operation—2009 
and 2010—its profit has increased steadily from 2011 to the present (2015). The 
firm’s profit history, including dividend payments and contributions to retained 
earnings, is summarized in Table 1.
Stanley started the firm with a $100,000 investment: his savings of $50,000 as 
equity and a $50,000 long-term loan from the bank. He had hoped to maintain his 
initial 100 percent ownership in the corporation, but after experiencing a $50,000 
loss during the first year of operation (2009), he sold 60 percent of the stock to a 
group of investors to obtain needed funds. Since then, no other stock transactions 
have taken place. Although he owns only 40 percent of the firm, Stanley actively 
manages all aspects of its activities; the other stockholders are not active in manage￾ment of the firm. The firm’s stock was valued at $4.50 per share in 2014 and at 
$5.28 per share in 2015.

TABLE 1268
Stanley has just prepared the firm’s 2015 income statement, balance sheet, and 
statement of retained earnings, shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4, along with the 2014 
balance sheet. In addition, he has compiled the 2014 ratio values and industry 
average ratio values for 2015, which are applicable to both 2014 and 2015 and 
are summarized in Table 5. He is quite pleased to have achieved record earnings of 
$48,000 in 2015, but he is concerned about the firm’s cash flows. Specifically, he 
is finding it more and more difficult to pay the firm’s bills in a timely manner and 
generate cash flows to investors, both creditors and owners. To gain insight into 
these cash flow problems, Stanley is planning to determine the firm’s 2015 operating 
cash flow (OCF) and free cash flow (FCF).
Stanley is further frustrated by the firm’s inability to afford to hire a software 
developer to complete development of a cost estimation package that is believed 
to have “blockbuster” sales potential. Stanley began development of this package 
2 years ago, but the firm’s growing complexity has forced him to devote more of 
his time to administrative duties, thereby halting the development of this product. 
Stanley’s reluctance to fill this position stems from his concern that the added 
$80,000 per year in salary and benefits for the position would certainly lower the 
firm’s earnings per share (EPS) over the next couple of years. Although the project’s 
success is in no way guaranteed, Stanley believes that if the money were spent to hire 
the software developer, the firm’s sales and earnings would significantly rise once 
the 2- to 3-year development, production, and marketing process was completed.
With all these concerns in mind, Stanley set out to review the various data to 
develop strategies that would help ensure a bright future for Track Software. Stanley 
believed that as part of this process, a thorough ratio analysis of the firm’s 2015 
results would provide important additional insights.

n Part 2, you learned how to use time-value-of-money tools to compare cash 
flows at different times. In the next two chapters, you’ll put those tools to use 
valuing the two most common types of securities: bonds and stocks.
Chapter 6 introduces you to the world of interest rates and bonds. Although 
bonds are among the safest investments available, they are not without risk. The 
primary risk that bond investors face is the risk that market interest rates will 
fluctuate. Those fluctuations cause bond prices to move, and those movements 
affect the returns that bond investors earn. Chapter 6 explains why interest rates 
vary from one bond to another and the factors that cause interest rates to move.
Chapter 7 focuses on stock valuation. It explains the characteristics of stock that 
distinguish it from debt and describes how companies issue stock to investors. 
You’ll have another chance to practice time-value-of-money techniques as Chapter 
7 illustrates how to value stocks by discounting either (1) the dividends that 
stockholders receive or (2) the free cash flows that the firm generates over time.

Who is the largest debtor in the world? The 
U.S. federal government is, of course. As of 
May 21, 2013, the national debt was more than 
$16.8 trillion, more than $1 trillion of which accrued in 
2012 alone. A little more than one-third of the outstand￾ing U.S. government debt is held by the U.S. Federal 
Reserve and other U.S. intragovernmental bodies, one￾third is held by foreign investors, about about one-third 
is held by individuals and institutions in the United 
States. Interest on the national debt is one of the largest items in the federal budget, totaling 
$360 billion in 2012. With Congressional Budget Office estimates projecting that from 2013 to 
2023 the cumulative deficits will be $6.3 trillion, the federal government has a huge need for 
outside financing, which dwarfs the capital needs of any corporation.
To feed this huge demand, the U.S. Treasury Department can issue T-bills, debt securities that 
mature in less than 1 year, Treasury notes that mature in 2 to 10 years, Treasury bonds that mature 
in 30 years, and savings bonds. Treasury securities can be purchased through TreasuryDirect, a 
Web-based system that allows investors to establish accounts to conduct transactions in Treasury 
securities online. Despite the government’s massive past and projected future deficits, U.S. Treasury 
securities are still regarded as the safest investments in the world. In this chapter, you’ll learn about 
the pricing of these and other debt instruments.

 6.1 Interest Rates and Required Returns
As noted in Chapter 2, financial institutions and markets create the mechanism 
through which funds flow between savers (funds suppliers) and borrowers (funds 
demanders). All else being equal, savers would like to earn as much interest as 
possible, and borrowers would like to pay as little as possible. The interest rate 
prevailing in the market at any given time reflects the equilibrium between savers 
and borrowers.
INTEREST RATE FuNdAMENTALS
The interest rate or required return represents the cost of money. It is the com￾pensation that a supplier of funds expects and a demander of funds must pay. 
Usually the term interest rate is applied to debt instruments such as bank loans 
or bonds, whereas the term required return may be applied to almost any kind 
of investment, including common stock, which gives the investor an ownership 
stake in the issuer. In fact, the meaning of these two terms is quite similar 
because in both cases the supplier is compensated for providing funds to the 
demander.
A variety of factors can influence the equilibrium interest rate. One factor is 
inflation, a rising trend in the prices of most goods and services. Typically, savers 
demand higher returns (that is, higher interest rates) when inflation is high be￾cause they want their investments to more than keep pace with rising prices. A 
second factor influencing interest rates is risk. When people perceive that a par￾ticular investment is riskier, they will expect a higher return on that investment as 
compensation for bearing the risk. A third factor that can affect the interest rate 
is a liquidity preference among investors. The term liquidity preference refers to 
the general tendency of investors to prefer short-term securities (that is, securities 
that are more liquid). If, all other things being equal, investors would prefer to 
buy short-term rather than long-term securities, interest rates on short-term in￾struments such as Treasury bills will be lower than rates on longer-term securi￾ties. Investors will hold these securities, despite the relatively low return that they 
offer, because they meet investors’ preferences for liquidity.

instruments such as bank loans

Matter of fact
N
ear the height of the financial crisis in December 2008, interest rates on Treasury bills briefly 
turned negative, meaning that investors paid more to the Treasury than the Treasury prom￾ised to pay back. Why would anyone put their money into an investment that they know will lose 
money? Remember that 2008 saw the demise of Lehman Brothers, and fears that other commer￾cial banks and investments banks might fail were rampant. Evidently, some investors were willing 
to pay the U.S. Treasury to keep their money safe for a short time.
Fear Turns T-Bill Rates Negative
The Real Rate of Interest
Imagine a perfect world in which there is no inflation, in which investors have no 
liquidity preferences, and in which there is no risk. In this world, there would be 
one cost of money: the real rate of interest. The real rate of interest 
real rate of interest

between the supply of savings 
and the demand for investment

without inflation, where 
suppliers and demanders of 
funds have no liquidity 
preferences and there is no risk.
LG 1ChAPTER 6   Interest Rates and Bond Valuation 275
creates equilibrium between the supply of savings and the demand for funds. It 
represents the most basic cost of money. Historically, the real rate of interest in 
the United States has averaged about 1 percent per year, but that figure does fluc￾tuate over time. This supply–demand relationship is shown in Figure 6.1 by the 
supply function (labeled S0
) and the demand function (labeled D). An equilibrium 
between the supply of funds and the demand for funds (S0 = D) occurs at a rate 
of interest r0*, the real rate of interest.
Clearly, the real rate of interest changes with changing economic conditions, 
tastes, and preferences. To combat a recession, the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System might initiate actions to increase the supply of credit in 
the economy, causing the supply function in Figure 6.1 to shift to, say, S1
. The 
result could be a lower real rate of interest, r1*, at equilibrium (S1 = D). With a 
lower cost of money, firms might find that investments that were previously unat￾tractive are now worth undertaking, and as firms hire more workers and spend 
more on plant and equipment, the economy begins to expand again.
Nominal or Actual Rate of Interest (Return)
The nominal rate of interest is the actual rate of interest charged by the supplier 
of funds and paid by the demander. Throughout this book, interest rates and re￾quired rates of return are nominal rates unless otherwise noted. The nominal rate 
of interest differs from the real rate of interest, r*, as a result of two factors, infla￾tion and risk. When people save money and invest it, they are sacrificing con￾sumption today (that is, they are spending less than they could) in return for 
higher future consumption. When investors expect inflation to occur, they believe 
that the price of consuming goods and services will be higher in the future than in 
the present. Therefore, they will be reluctant to sacrifice today’s consumption un￾less the return they can earn on the money they save (or invest) will be high 
enough to allow them to purchase the goods and services they desire at a higher 
future price. That is, investors will demand a higher nominal rate of return if they 
expect inflation. The additional return that investors require to compensate them 
for inflation is called the expected inflation premium (IP).

Similarly, investors generally demand higher rates of return on risky invest￾ments as compared to safe ones. Otherwise, there is little incentive for investors 
to bear the additional risk. Therefore, investors will demand a higher nominal 
rate of return on risky investments. The additional return that investors require 
to compensate them for bearing risk is called the risk premium (RP). Therefore, 
the nominal rate of interest for security 1, r1
, is given by

As the horizontal braces below the equation indicate, the nominal rate, r1
, can be 
viewed as having two basic components: a risk-free rate of return, RF
, and a risk 
premium, RP1
:
r1 = RF + RP1
(6.2)
For the moment, ignore the risk premium, RP1
, and focus exclusively on the 
risk-free rate. Equation 6.1 says that the risk-free rate can be represented as
RF = r* + IP (6.3)
The risk-free rate (as shown in Equation 6.3) embodies the real rate of interest 
plus the expected inflation premium. The inflation premium is driven by inves￾tors’ expectations about inflation: The more inflation they expect, the higher will 
be the inflation premium, and the higher will be the nominal interest rate.
Three-month U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills) are short-term IOUs issued by the 
U.S. Treasury, and they are widely regarded as the safest investments in the 
world. They are as close as we can get in the real world to a risk-free investment. 
To estimate the real rate of interest, analysts typically try to determine what rate 
of inflation investors expect over the coming 3 months. Next, they subtract the 
expected inflation rate from the nominal rate on the 3-month T-bill to arrive at 
the underlying real rate of interest. For the risk-free asset in Equation 6.3, the real 
rate of interest, r*, would equal RF - IP. A simple personal finance example can 
demonstrate the practical distinction between nominal and real rates of interest.
Marilyn Carbo has $10 that she can spend on candy costing 
$0.25 per piece. She could buy 40 pieces of candy ($10.00 ,
$0.25) today. The nominal rate of interest on a 1-year investment is currently 7%, 
and the expected rate of inflation over the coming year is 4%. Instead of buying the 
40 pieces of candy today, Marilyn could invest the $10. After 1 year, she would 
have $10.70 because she would have earned 7% interest—an additional $0.70 
(0.07 * $10.00)—on her $10 investment. During that year, inflation would have 
increased the cost of the candy by 4%—an additional $0.01 (0.04 * $0.25)—to 
$0.26 per piece. As a result, at the end of the 1-year period Marilyn would be able 
to buy about 41.2 pieces of candy ($10.70 , $0.26), or roughly 3% more 
(41.2 , 40.0 = 1.03). The 3% increase in Marilyn’s buying power represents her 
real rate of return. The nominal rate of return on her investment (7%) is partly 
eroded by inflation (4%), so her real return during the year is the difference be￾tween the nominal rate and the inflation rate (7, - 4, = 3,).

The value of bonds, as 
fixed-income security, 
is negatively related to changes in the 
nominal interest rate. One component 
of interest rate under the control of the 
government is real interest rate, which is 
determined by the Federal Reserve or 
the central bank of a country. The other 
component of interest rate is determined 
by the market prices, and measured 
through the Consumer Price Index (infla￾tion). Over time, the real interest rate 
does not fluctuate sharply, but inflation 
usually does, resulting in a higher or 
lower nominal interest rate.
Saving and Loans Bank (S&LB) is a 
governmental social bank located in 
Kuwait with paid-up capital of $8,850 
million, and more than $12,500 
million in outstanding loans. Recently, 
the S&LB finalized an in-depth plan to 
securitize the $12,500 million in 
outstanding loans. Backed by the full 
focus on PRACTICE
in practice To avoid the reinvestment risk, it was 
planned to issue the bonds as deeply dis￾counted bonds with a zero coupon rate. 
The investors of the treasury bonds will 
have to hold them until maturity to get the 
maximum benefits. This, in turn, will re￾duce the liquidity of the bonds in the sec￾ondary market, resulting in lower market 
value. The idea was to sell each issue to 
one major institutional investor who could 
strip the issue by selling securities with dif￾ferent maturities to increase the liquidity of 
the issues.

faith of the Kuwaiti government, the 
bank plans to issue bonds against the 
outstanding loans. The treasury bonds 
will be free of default risk but not free 
of inflation, or reinvestment risk. Based 
on a regional market’s survey, the 
maturity will range between 5, 7, and 
10 years. To avoid the negative effect 
of inflation on the bond value, S&LB 
plans to index the bonds to inflation or 
to an equity index. If issued bonds are 
indexed to inflation, the periodic 
coupon will be equal to the inflation 
level plus 150 to 200 basis points. If 
they are equity indexed, the coupon 
rate will be equal to the equity index 
minus 100 to 150 basis points. 
Another proposed method of indexing 
these bonds is to adjust their par value 
to the inflation or equity index. 
Therefore, the issued bonds will not be 
viewed as fixed income securities but 
treated as floating income securities.
Bond Valuation and Interest Rate Risk
The premium for expected inflation in Equation 6.3 represents the average 
rate of inflation expected over the life of an investment. It is not the rate of infla￾tion experienced over the immediate past, although investors’ inflation expecta￾tions are undoubtedly influenced by the rate of inflation that has occurred in the 
recent past. Even so, the inflation premium reflects the expected rate of inflation. 
The expected inflation premium changes over time in response to many factors, 
such as changes in monetary and fiscal policies, currency movements, and inter￾national political events. For a discussion of a U.S. debt security whose interest 
rate is adjusted for inflation, see the Focus on Practice box above.
Figure 6.2 illustrates the annual movement of the rate of inflation and the 
risk-free rate of return from 1961 through 2012. During this period, the two 
rates tended to move in a similar fashion. Note that T-bill rates were slightly 
above the inflation rate most of the time, meaning that T-bills generally of￾fered a small positive real return. Between 1978 and the early 1980s, inflation 
and interest rates were quite high, peaking at more than 13 percent in 1980–
1981. Since then, rates have gradually declined. To combat a severe recession, 
the Federal Reserve pushed interest rates down to almost 0% in 2009 and 
kept them there for several years. Note that over this entire period, the infla￾tion rate was negative only once (in 2009). Even though the economy experi￾enced a positive inflation rate each year from 2010 to 2012, the Fed kept in￾terest rates near zero, so the real interest rate in those years was actually 
negative.

TERM STRuCTuRE OF INTEREST RATES
The term structure of interest rates is the relationship between the maturity and 
rate of return for bonds with similar levels of risk. A graph of this relationship is 
called the yield curve. A quick glance at the yield curve tells analysts how rates vary 
between short-, medium-, and long-term bonds, but it may also provide informa￾tion on where interest rates and the economy in general are headed in the future. 
Usually, when analysts examine the term structure of interest rates, they focus on 
Treasury securities because they are generally considered to be free of default risk.
Yield Curves
A bond’s yield to maturity (YTM) (discussed later in this chapter) represents the 
compound annual rate of return that an investor earns on the bond, assuming that 
the bond makes all promised payments and the investor holds the bond to matu￾rity. In a yield curve, the yield to maturity is plotted on the vertical axis and time 
to maturity is plotted on the horizontal axis. Figure 6.3 shows three yield curves 
for U.S. Treasury securities: one at May 22, 1981, a second at September 29, 
1989, and a third at May 20, 2013.
Observe that both the position and the shape of the yield curves change over 
time. The yield curve of May 22, 1981, indicates that short-term interest rates at that 
time were above longer-term rates. For reasons that a glance at the figure makes ob￾vious, this curve is described as downward sloping. Interest rates in May 1981 were 
also quite high by historical standards, so the overall level of the yield curve is high. 
Historically, a downward-sloping yield curve, which is sometimes called an inverted 
yield curve, occurs infrequently and is often a sign that the economy is weakening. 
Most recessions in the United States have been preceded by an inverted yield curve.
Usually, short-term interest rates are lower than long-term interest rates, as
they were on May 20, 2013. That is, the normal yield curve is upward sloping. 
Notice that the May 2013 yield curve lies entirely beneath the other two curves

shown in Figure 6.3. In other words, interest rates in May 2013 were unusually 
low, largely because at that time the economy was still recovering from a deep 
recession, and the Federal Reserve was exerting downward pressure on interest 
rates to stimulate the economy. Sometimes, a flat yield curve, similar to that of 
September 29, 1989, exists. A flat yield curve simply means that rates do not vary 
much at different maturities.
The shape of the yield curve may affect the firm’s financing decisions. A fi￾nancial manager who faces a downward-sloping yield curve may be tempted to 
rely more heavily on cheaper, long-term financing. However, a risk in following 
this strategy is that interest rates may fall in the future, so long-term rates that 
seem cheap today may be relatively expensive tomorrow. Likewise, when the 
yield curve is upward sloping, the manager may believe that it is wise to use 
cheaper, short-term financing. Relying on short-term financing has its own risks. 
Firms that borrow on a short-term basis may see their costs rise if interest rates 
go up. Even more serious is the risk that a firm may not be able to refinance a 
short-term loan when it comes due. A variety of factors influence the choice of 
loan maturity, but the shape of the yield curve is something that managers must 
consider when making decisions about short-term versus long-term borrowing.

Matter of fact
Bond Yields Hit Record Lows
O
n July 25, 2012, the 10-year Treasury note and 30-year Treasury bond yields reached 
all-time lows of 1.43% and 2.46%. That was good news for the housing market. Many 
mortgage rates are linked to rates on Treasury securities. For example, the traditional 30-year 
mortgage rate is typically linked to the yield on 10-year Treasury notes. With mortgage rates 
reaching new lows, potential buyers found that they could afford more expensive homes, and 
existing homeowners were able to refinance their existing loans, lowering their monthly mort￾gage payments and leaving them with more money to spend on other things. This kind of activ￾ity is precisely what the Federal Reserve hoped to stimulate by keeping interest rates low during 
the economic recovery.280 PART 3   Valuation of Securities
Theories of Term Structure
Three theories are frequently cited to explain the general shape of the yield 
curve: the expectations theory, the liquidity preference theory, and the market 
segmentation theory.
Expectations Theory One theory of the term structure of interest rates, 
the expectations theory, suggests that the yield curve reflects investor expecta￾tions about future interest rates. According to this theory, when investors ex￾pect short-term interest rates to rise in the future (perhaps because investors 
believe that inflation will rise in the future), today’s long-term rates will be 
higher than current short-term rates, and the yield curve will be upward slop￾ing. The opposite is true when investors expect declining short-term rates: To￾day’s short-term rates will be higher than current long-term rates, and the yield 
curve will be inverted.
To understand the expectations theory, consider this example. Suppose 
that the yield curve is flat. The rate on a 1-year Treasury note is 4 percent, and 
so is the rate on a 2-year Treasury note. Now, consider an investor who has 
money to place into a low-risk investment for 2 years. The investor has two 
options. First, he could purchase the 2-year Treasury note and receive a total of 
8 percent (ignoring compounding) in 2 years. Second, he could invest in the 
1-year Treasury earning 4 percent, and then when that security matures, he 
could reinvest in another 1-year Treasury note. If the investor wants to maxi￾mize his expected return, the decision between the first and second options 
above depends on whether he expects interest rates to rise, fall, or remain un￾changed during the next year.
If the investor believes that interest rates will rise, it means next year’s re￾turn on a 1-year Treasury note will be greater than 4 percent (that is, greater 
than the 1-year Treasury rate right now). Let’s say the investor believes that the 
interest rate on a 1-year note next year will be 5 percent. If the investor expects 
rising rates, his expected return is higher if he follows the second option, buying 
a 1-year Treasury note now (paying 4 percent) and reinvesting in a new security 
that pays 5 percent next year. Over 2 years, the investor would expect to earn 
about 9 percent (ignoring compounding) in interest, compared to just 8 percent 
earned by holding the 2-year bond.
If the current 1-year rate is 4 percent and investors generally expect that 
rate to go up to 5 percent next year, what would the 2-year Treasury note rate 
have to be right now to remain competitive? The answer is 4.5 percent. An 
investor who buys this security and holds it for 2 years would earn about 
9 percent interest (again, ignoring compounding), the same as the expected 
return from investing in two consecutive 1-year bonds. In other words, if in￾vestors expect interest rates to rise, the 2-year rate today must be higher than 
the 1-year rate today, and that in turn means that the yield curve must have 
an upward slope.
Suppose that a 5-year Treasury note currently offers a 3% annual return. Inves￾tors believe that interest rates are going to decline, and 5 years from now, they 
expect the rate on a 5-year Treasury note to be 2.5%. According to the expecta￾tions theory, what is the return that a 10-year Treasury note has to offer today? 
What does this imply about the slope of the yield curve?
Example 6.2 ▶
expectations theory
The theory that the yield curve 
reflects investor expectations 
about future interest rates; an 
expectation of rising interest 
rates results in an upward￾sloping yield curve, and an 
expectation of declining rates 
results in a downward-sloping 
yield curve.ChAPTER 6   Interest Rates and Bond Valuation 281
Consider an investor who purchases a 5-year note today and plans to reinvest in 
another 5-year note in the future. Over the 10-year investment horizon, this investor 
expects to earn about 27.5%, ignoring compounding (that’s 3% per year for the 
first 5 years and 2.5% per year for the next 5 years). To compete with that return, a 
10-year bond today could offer 2.75% per year. That is, a bond that pays 2.75% for 
each of the next 10 years produces the same 27.5% total return that the series of two 
5-year notes is expected to produce. Therefore, the 5-year rate today is 3% and the 
10-year rate today is 2.75%, and the yield curve is downward sloping.
Liquidity Preference Theory Most of the time, yield curves are upward slop￾ing, which, according to the expectations theory, means that investors expect inter￾est rates to rise. An alternative explanation for the typical upward slope of the yield 
curve is the liquidity preference theory. This theory holds that, all else being equal, 
investors generally prefer to buy short-term securities, while issuers prefer to sell 
long-term securities. For investors, short-term securities are attractive because they 
are highly liquid and their prices are not particularly volatile.1
 Hence, investors will 
accept somewhat lower rates on short-term bonds because they are less risky than 
long-term bonds. Conversely, when firms or governments want to lock in their bor￾rowing costs for a long period of time by selling long-term bonds, those bonds have 
to offer higher rates to entice investors away from the short-term securities that 
they prefer. Borrowers are willing to pay somewhat higher rates because long-term 
debt allows them to eliminate or reduce the risk of not being able to refinance 
short-term debts when they come due. Borrowing on a long-term basis also reduces 
uncertainty about future borrowing costs.
Market Segmentation Theory The market segmentation theory suggests 
that the market for loans is totally segmented on the basis of maturity and that 
the supply of and demand for loans within each segment determine its prevail￾ing interest rate. In other words, the equilibrium between suppliers and de￾manders of short-term funds, such as seasonal business loans, would determine 
prevailing short-term interest rates, and the equilibrium between suppliers and 
demanders of long-term funds, such as real estate loans, would determine pre￾vailing long-term interest rates. The slope of the yield curve would be deter￾mined by the general relationship between the prevailing rates in each market 
segment. Simply stated, an upward-sloping yield curve indicates greater bor￾rowing demand relative to the supply of funds in the long-term segment of the 
debt market relative to the short-term segment.
All three term structure theories have merit. From them, we can conclude 
that at any time the slope of the yield curve is affected by (1) interest rate expecta￾tions, (2) liquidity preferences, and (3) the comparative equilibrium of supply and 
demand in the short- and long-term market segments. Upward-sloping yield 
curves result from expectations of rising interest rates, lender preferences for 
shorter-maturity loans, and greater supply of short-term loans than of long-term 
loans relative to demand. The opposite conditions would result in a downward￾sloping yield curve. At any time, the interaction of these three forces determines 
the prevailing slope of the yield curve.
1. Later in this chapter, we demonstrate that debt instruments with longer maturities are more sensitive to changing 
market interest rates. For a given change in market rates, the price or value of longer-term debts will be more sig￾nificantly changed (up or down) than the price or value of debts with shorter maturities.
liquidity preference theory
Theory suggesting that long￾term rates are generally higher 
than short-term rates (hence, 
the yield curve is upward 
sloping) because investors 
perceive short-term investments 
to be more liquid and less risky 
than long-term investments. 
Borrowers must offer higher 
rates on long-term bonds to 
entice investors away from 
their preferred short-term 
securities.
market segmentation theory
Theory suggesting that the 
market for loans is segmented 
on the basis of maturity and 
that the supply of and demand 
for loans within each segment 
determine its prevailing interest 
rate; the slope of the yield 
curve is determined by the 
general relationship between 
the prevailing rates in each 
market segment.282 PART 3   Valuation of Securities
RISK PREMIuMS: ISSuER ANd ISSuE ChARACTERISTICS
So far, we have considered only risk-free U.S. Treasury securities. We now rein￾troduce the risk premium and assess it in view of risky non-Treasury issues. Re￾call Equation 6.1:
r1 = r
¯˘˙ * + IP +
¯˘˙
RP1
risk-free 
rate, RF
risk 
premium
In words, the nominal rate of interest for security 1 (r1
) is equal to the risk-free 
rate, consisting of the real rate of interest (r*) plus the inflation expectation pre￾mium (IP), plus the risk premium (RP1
). The risk premium varies with specific 
issuer and issue characteristics.
The nominal interest rates on a number of classes of long-term securities in May 
2013 were as follows:
Example 6.3 ▶
Security Nominal interest rate
U.S. Treasury bonds (average) 3.18%
Corporate bonds (by risk ratings):  
High quality (Aaa–Aa) 3.94%
Medium quality (Baa–Baa) 4.76%
Speculative (Ba–C) 5.46%
Security Risk premium
Corporate bonds (by ratings):  
High quality (Aaa–Aa) 3.94% 2 3.18% 5 0.76%
Medium quality (A–Baa) 4.76% 2 3.18% 5 1.58%
Speculative (Ba–C) 5.46% 2 3.18% 5 2.28%
Because the U.S. Treasury bond would represent the risk-free, long-term security, 
we can calculate the risk premium of the other securities by subtracting the risk￾free rate, 3.18%, from each nominal rate (yield):
These risk premiums reflect differing issuer and issue risks. The lower-rated 
(speculative) corporate issues have a higher risk premium than that of the higher￾rated corporate issues (high quality and medium quality), and that risk premium 
is the compensation that investors demand for bearing the higher default risk of 
lower quality bonds.
The risk premium consists of a number of issuer- and issue-related components, 
including business risk, financial risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and tax risk, as 
well as the purely debt-specific risks—default risk, maturity risk, and contractual pro￾vision risk—briefly defined in Table 6.1. In general, the highest risk premiums and 
therefore the highest returns result from securities issued by firms with a high risk of 
default and from long-term maturities that have unfavorable contractual provisions.

6.2 Corporate Bonds
A corporate bond is a long-term debt instrument indicating that a corporation 
has borrowed a certain amount of money and promises to repay it in the future 
under clearly defined terms. Most bonds are issued with maturities of 10 to 
30 years and with a par value, or face value, of $1,000. The coupon interest rate
on a bond represents the percentage of the bond’s par value that will be paid an￾nually, typically in two equal semiannual payments, as interest. The bondholders, 
who are the lenders, are promised the semiannual interest payments and, at ma￾turity, repayment of the principal amount.
Component Description
Default risk The possibility that the issuer of debt will not pay the contractual 
interest or principal as scheduled. The greater the uncertainty as to the 
borrower’s ability to meet these payments, the greater the risk premium. 
High bond ratings reflect low default risk, and low bond ratings reflect 
high default risk.
Maturity risk That the longer the maturity, the more the value of a security will 
change in response to a given change in interest rates. If interest rates on 
otherwise similar-risk securities suddenly rise, the prices of long-term bonds 
will decline by more than the prices of short-term bonds and vice versa.a
Contractual 
provision risk
Conditions that are often included in a debt agreement or a stock issue. 
Some of these reduce risk, whereas others may increase risk. For example, a 
provision allowing a bond issuer to retire its bonds prior to their maturity 
under favorable terms increases the bond’s risk.
aA detailed discussion of the effects of interest rates on the price or value of bonds and other fixed-income 
securities is presented later in this chapter.

LEGAL ASPECTS OF CORPORATE BONdS
Certain legal arrangements are required to protect purchasers of bonds. Bond￾holders are protected primarily through the indenture and the trustee.
Bond Indenture
A bond indenture is a legal document that specifies both the rights of the bondhold￾ers and the duties of the issuing corporation. Included in the indenture are descrip￾tions of the amount and timing of all interest and principal payments, various 
standard and restrictive provisions, and, frequently, sinking-fund requirements and 
security interest provisions. The borrower commonly must (1) maintain satisfactory 
accounting records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP), (2) periodically supply audited financial statements, (3) pay taxes and other 
liabilities when due, and (4) maintain all facilities in good working order.
Standard Provisions The standard debt provisions in the bond indenture 
specify certain record-keeping and general business practices that the bond issuer 
must follow.
Restrictive Provisions Bond indentures also normally include certain 
restrictive covenants, which place operating and financial constraints on the 
borrower. These provisions help protect the bondholder against increases in 
borrower risk. Without them, the borrower could increase the firm’s risk but 
not have to pay increased interest to compensate for the increased risk.
The most common restrictive covenants do the following:
 1. Require a minimum level of liquidity, to ensure against loan default.
 2. Prohibit the sale of accounts receivable to generate cash. Selling receivables 
could cause a long-run cash shortage if proceeds were used to meet current 
obligations.
 3. Impose fixed-asset restrictions. The borrower must maintain a specified level 
of fixed assets to guarantee its ability to repay the bonds.
 4. Constrain subsequent borrowing. Additional long-term debt may be prohib￾ited, or additional borrowing may be subordinated to the original loan. 
Subordination means that subsequent creditors agree to wait until all claims 
of the senior debt are satisfied.
 5. Limit the firm’s annual cash dividend payments to a specified percentage or 
amount.
Other restrictive covenants are sometimes included in bond indentures.
The violation of any standard or restrictive provision by the borrower gives 
the bondholders the right to demand immediate repayment of the debt. Gener￾ally, bondholders evaluate any violation to determine whether it jeopardizes the 
loan. They may then decide to demand immediate repayment, continue the loan, 
or alter the terms of the bond indenture.
Sinking-Fund Requirements Another common restrictive provision is a 
sinking-fund requirement. Its objective is to provide for the systematic retirement 
of bonds prior to their maturity. To carry out this requirement, the corporation 
makes semiannual or annual payments that are used to retire bonds by purchas￾ing them in the marketplace.

Security Interest The bond indenture identifies any collateral pledged 
against the bond and specifies how it is to be maintained. The protection of bond 
collateral is crucial to guarantee the safety of a bond issue.
Trustee
A trustee is a third party to a bond indenture. The trustee can be an individual, a 
corporation, or (most often) a commercial bank trust department. The trustee is 
paid to act as a “watchdog” on behalf of the bondholders and can take specified 
actions on behalf of the bondholders if the terms of the indenture are violated.
COST OF BONdS TO ThE ISSuER
The cost of bond financing is generally greater than the issuer would have to pay 
for short-term borrowing. The major factors that affect the cost, which is the rate 
of interest paid by the bond issuer, are the bond’s maturity, the size of the offer￾ing, the issuer’s risk, and the basic cost of money.
Impact of Bond Maturity
Generally, as we noted earlier in Section 6.1, long-term debt pays higher interest 
rates than short-term debt. In a practical sense, the longer the maturity of a bond, 
the less accuracy there is in predicting future interest rates and therefore the greater 
the bondholders’ risk of giving up an opportunity to lend money at a higher rate. In 
addition, the longer the term, the greater the chance that the issuer might default.
Impact of Offering Size
The size of the bond offering also affects the interest cost of borrowing but in an 
inverse manner: Bond flotation and administration costs per dollar borrowed are 
likely to decrease with increasing offering size. On the other hand, the risk to the 
bondholders may increase, because larger offerings result in greater risk of default.
Impact of Issuer’s Risk
The greater the issuer’s default risk, the higher the interest rate. Some of this risk 
can be reduced through inclusion of appropriate restrictive provisions in the bond 
indenture. Clearly, bondholders must be compensated with higher returns for 
taking greater risk. Frequently, bond buyers rely on bond ratings (discussed later) 
to determine the issuer’s overall risk.
Impact of the Cost of Money
The cost of money in the capital market is the basis for determining a bond’s 
coupon interest rate. Generally, the rate on U.S. Treasury securities of equal ma￾turity is used as the lowest-risk cost of money. To that basic rate is added a risk 
premium (as described earlier in this chapter) that reflects the factors mentioned 
above (maturity, offering size, and issuer’s risk).
GENERAL FEATuRES OF A BONd ISSuE
Three features sometimes included in a corporate bond issue are a conversion 
feature, a call feature, and stock purchase warrants. These features provide the 
issuer or the purchaser with certain opportunities for replacing or retiring the 
bond or supplementing it with some type of equity issue.
trustee
A paid individual, corporation, 
or commercial bank trust 
department that acts as the 
third party to a bond indenture 
and can take specified actions 
on behalf of the bondholders if 
the terms of the indenture are 
violated.286 PART 3   Valuation of Securities
Convertible bonds offer a conversion feature that allows bondholders to 
change each bond into a stated number of shares of common stock. Bondholders 
convert their bonds into stock only when the market price of the stock is such 
that conversion will provide a profit for the bondholder. Inclusion of the conver￾sion feature by the issuer lowers the interest cost and provides for automatic 
conversion of the bonds to stock if future stock prices appreciate noticeably.
The call feature is included in nearly all corporate bond issues. It gives the issuer 
the opportunity to repurchase bonds prior to maturity. The call price is the stated 
price at which bonds may be repurchased prior to maturity. Sometimes the call 
feature can be exercised only during a certain period. As a rule, the call price exceeds 
the par value of a bond by an amount equal to 1 year’s interest. For example, a 
$1,000 bond with a 10 percent coupon interest rate would be callable for around 
$1,100 3$1,000 + (10, * $1,000)4. The amount by which the call price exceeds 
the bond’s par value is commonly referred to as the call premium. This premium 
compensates bondholders for having the bond called away from them; to the issuer, 
it is the cost of calling the bonds.
The call feature enables an issuer to call an outstanding bond when interest 
rates fall and issue a new bond at a lower interest rate. When interest rates rise, 
the call privilege will not be exercised, except possibly to meet sinking-fund re￾quirements. Of course, to sell a callable bond in the first place, the issuer must 
pay a higher interest rate than on noncallable bonds of equal risk, to compensate 
bondholders for the risk of having the bonds called away from them.
Bonds occasionally have stock purchase warrants attached as “sweeteners” 
to make them more attractive to prospective buyers. Stock purchase warrants are 
instruments that give their holders the right to purchase a certain number of 
shares of the issuer’s common stock at a specified price over a certain period of 
time. Their inclusion typically enables the issuer to pay a slightly lower coupon 
interest rate than would otherwise be required.
BONd YIELdS
The yield, or rate of return, on a bond is frequently used to assess a bond’s per￾formance over a given period of time, typically 1 year. Because there are a num￾ber of ways to measure a bond’s yield, it is important to understand popular yield 
measures. The three most widely cited bond yields are (1) current yield, (2) yield 
to maturity (YTM), and (3) yield to call (YTC). Each of these yields provides a 
unique measure of the return on a bond.
The simplest yield measure is the current yield, the annual interest payment 
divided by the current price. For example, a $1,000 par value bond with an 8 per￾cent coupon interest rate that currently sells for $970 would have a current yield of 
8.25,3 (0.08 * $1,000) , $9704 . This measure indicates the cash return for the 
year from the bond. However, because current yield ignores any change in bond 
value, it does not measure the total return. As we’ll see later in this chapter, both 
the yield to maturity and the yield to call measure the total return.
BONd PRICES
Because most corporate bonds are purchased and held by institutional investors, 
such as banks, insurance companies, and mutual funds, rather than individual 
investors, bond trading and price data are not readily available to individuals. 
Table 6.2 includes some data on the bonds of five companies, noted A through E.

to repurchase bonds at a stated

A measure of a bond’s cash 
return for the year; calculated 
by dividing the bond’s annual 
interest payment by its current 
price.ChAPTER 6   Interest Rates and Bond Valuation 287
Looking at the data for Company C’s bond, which is highlighted in the table, we 
see that the bond has a coupon interest rate of 5.200 percent and a maturity date 
of January 15, 2017. These data identify a specific bond issued by Company C. 
(The company could have more than a single bond issue outstanding.) The price 
represents the final price at which the bond traded on the current day.
Although most corporate bonds are issued with a par, or face value of 
$1,000, all bonds are quoted as a percentage of par. A $1,000 par-value bond 
quoted at 94.007 is priced at $940.07 (94.007, * $1,000). Corporate bonds 
are quoted in dollars and cents. Thus, Company C’s price of 103.143 for the day 
was $1,031.43 (that is, 103.143, * $1,000).
The final column of Table 6.2 represents the bond’s yield to maturity (YTM),
which is the compound annual rate of return that would be earned on the bond if 
it were purchased and held to maturity. (YTM is discussed in detail later in this 
chapter.)
BONd RATINGS
Independent agencies such as Moody’s, Fitch, and Standard & Poor’s assess 
the riskiness of publicly traded bond issues. These agencies derive their rat￾ings by using financial ratio and cash flow analyses to assess the likely pay￾ment of bond interest and principal. Table 6.3 summarizes these ratings. For 
discussion of ethical issues related to the bond-rating agencies, see the Focus 
on Ethics box.
Normally, an inverse relationship exists between the quality of a bond and 
the rate of return that it must provide bondholders: High-quality (high-rated) 
bonds provide lower returns than lower-quality (low-rated) bonds, reflecting the 
lender’s risk–return trade-off. When considering bond financing, the financial 
manager must be concerned with the expected ratings of the bond issue because 
these ratings affect salability and cost.
COMMON TYPES OF BONdS
Bonds can be classified in a variety of ways. Here we break them into traditional

Moody’s Investors Ser￾vice, Standard & 
Poor’s, and Fitch Ratings play a crucial 
role in the financial markets. These 
credit-rating agencies evaluate and at￾tach ratings to credit instruments (for ex￾ample, bonds). Historically, bonds that 
received higher ratings were almost al￾ways repaid, whereas lower-rated, 
more speculative “junk” bonds experi￾enced much higher default rates. The 
agencies’ ratings have a direct impact 
on firms’ costs of raising external capital 
and investors’ appraisals of fixed-in￾come investments.
Recently, the credit-rating agencies 
have been criticized for their role in the 
subprime crisis. The agencies attached 
ratings to complex securities that did not 
reflect the true risk of the underlying in￾vestments. For example, securities 
backed by mortgages issued to borrow￾ers with bad credit and no documented 
income often received investment-grade 
ratings that implied almost zero proba￾bility of default. However, when home 
prices began to decline in 2006, secu￾rities backed by risky mortgages did de￾fault, including many that had been 
rated investment grade.
It is not entirely clear why the rating 
agencies assigned such high ratings to 
these securities. Did the agencies be￾lieve that complex financial engineering 
could create investment-grade securities 
out of risky mortgage loans? Did the 
agencies understand the securities they 
were rating? Were they unduly influ￾enced by the security issuers, who also 
happened to pay for the ratings? Ap￾parently, some within the rating agen￾cies were suspicious. In a December 
2006 e-mail exchange between col￾leagues at Standard & Poor’s, one indi￾vidual proclaimed, “Let’s hope we are 
all wealthy and retired by the time this 
house of cards falters.”a

INTERNATIONAL BONd ISSuES
Companies and governments borrow internationally by issuing bonds in two prin￾cipal financial markets: the Eurobond market and the foreign bond market. Both 
give borrowers the opportunity to obtain large amounts of long-term debt financ￾ing quickly, in the currency of their choice and with flexible repayment terms.
A Eurobond is issued by an international borrower and sold to investors in 
countries with currencies other than the currency in which the bond is denomi￾nated. An example is a dollar-denominated bond issued by a U.S. corporation 
and sold to Belgian investors. From the founding of the Eurobond market in the 
1960s until the mid-1980s, “blue chip” U.S. corporations were the largest single 
class of Eurobond issuers. Some of these companies were able to borrow in this 
market at interest rates below those the U.S. government paid on Treasury bonds. 
As the market matured, issuers became able to choose the currency in which they 
borrowed, and European and Japanese borrowers rose to prominence. In more 
recent years, the Eurobond market has become much more balanced in terms of 
the mix of borrowers, total issue volume, and currency of denomination.

Characteristics and Priority of Lender’s Claim of Traditional Types of Bonds
Bond type Characteristics Priority of lender’s claim
Unsecured bonds  
Debentures Unsecured bonds that only creditworthy 
firms can issue. Convertible bonds are 
normally debentures.
Claims are the same as those of any general creditor. 
May have other unsecured bonds subordinated to 
them.
Subordinated debentures Claims are not satisfied until those of the 
creditors holding certain (senior) debts 
have been fully satisfied.
Claim is that of a general creditor but not as good as 
a senior debt claim.
Income bonds Payment of interest is required only when 
earnings are available. Commonly issued 
in reorganization of a failing firm.
Claim is that of a general creditor. Are not in default 
when interest payments are missed because they are 
contingent only on earnings being available.
Secured Bonds  
Mortgage bonds Secured by real estate or buildings. Claim is on proceeds from sale of mortgaged assets; 
if not fully satisfied, the lender becomes a general 
creditor. The first-mortgage claim must be fully sat￾isfied before distribution of proceeds to second￾mortgage holders and so on. A number of mortgages 
can be issued against the same collateral.
Collateral trust bonds Secured by stock and (or) bonds that are 
owned by the issuer. Collateral value is 
generally 25% to 35% greater than bond 
value.
Claim is on proceeds from stock and/or bond collat￾eral; if not fully satisfied, the lender becomes a gen￾eral creditor.
Equipment trust certificates Used to finance “rolling stock,” such as 
airplanes, trucks, boats, railroad cars. 
A trustee buys the asset with funds 
raised through the sale of trust certifi￾cates and then leases it to the firm; af￾ter making the final scheduled lease 
payment, the firm receives title to the 
asset. A type of leasing.
Claim is on proceeds from the sale of the asset; if 
proceeds do not satisfy outstanding debt, trust cer￾tificate lenders become general creditors.

In contrast, a foreign bond is issued by a foreign corporation or government 
and is denominated in the investor’s home currency and sold in the investor’s 
home market. A Swiss-franc–denominated bond issued in Switzerland by a U.S. 
company is an example of a foreign bond. The three largest foreign-bond markets

Zero- (or low-) coupon bonds Issued with no (zero) or a very low coupon (stated interest) rate and sold at a large discount 
from par. A significant portion (or all) of the investor’s return comes from gain in value (that 
is, par value minus purchase price). Generally callable at par value.
Junk bonds Debt rated Ba or lower by Moody’s or BB or lower by Standard & Poor’s. Commonly used 
by rapidly growing firms to obtain growth capital, most often as a way to finance mergers 
and takeovers. High-risk bonds with high yields, often yielding 2% to 3% more than the best￾quality corporate debt.
Floating-rate bonds Stated interest rate is adjusted periodically within stated limits in response to changes in speci￾fied money market or capital market rates. Popular when future inflation and interest rates 
are uncertain. Tend to sell at close to par because of the automatic adjustment to changing 
market conditions. Some issues provide for annual redemption at par at the option of the 
bondholder.
Extendible notes Short maturities, typically 1 to 5 years, that can be renewed for a similar period at the 
option of holders. Similar to a floating-rate bond. An issue might be a series of 3-year 
renewable notes over a period of 15 years; every 3 years, the notes could be extended for 
another 3 years, at a new rate competitive with market interest rates at the time of 
renewal.
Putable bonds Bonds that can be redeemed at par (typically, $1,000) at the option of their holder either at 
specific dates after the date of issue and every 1 to 5 years thereafter or when and if the firm 
takes specified actions, such as being acquired, acquiring another company, or issuing a large 
amount of additional debt. In return for its conferring the right to “put the bond” at specified 
times or when the firm takes certain actions, the bond’s yield is lower than that of a non￾putable bond.

6.3 Valuation Fundamentals
Valuation is the process that links risk and return to determine the worth of an 
asset. It is a relatively simple process that can be applied to expected streams of 
benefits from bonds, stocks, income properties, oil wells, and so on. To deter￾mine an asset’s worth at a given point in time, a financial manager uses the time￾value-of-money techniques presented in Chapter 5 and the concepts of risk and 
return that we will develop in Chapter 8.
KEY INPuTS
There are three key inputs to the valuation process: (1) cash flows (returns), 
(2) timing, and (3) a measure of risk, which determines the required return. Each 
is described below.
Cash Flows (Returns)
The value of any asset depends on the cash flow(s) it is expected to provide over 
the ownership period. To have value, an asset does not have to provide an annual 
cash flow; it can provide an intermittent cash flow or even a single cash flow over 
the period.
Celia Sargent wishes to estimate the value of three assets she is 
considering investing in: common stock in Michaels Enter￾prises, an interest in an oil well, and an original painting by a well-known artist. 
Her cash flow estimates for each are as follows:
Stock in Michaels Enterprises Expect to receive cash dividends of $300 per 
year indefinitely.
Oil well Expect to receive cash flow of $2,000 at the end of year 1, $4,000 at 
the end of year 2, and $10,000 at the end of year 4, when the well is to be sold.
Original painting Expect to be able to sell the painting in 5 years for 
$85,000.
With these cash flow estimates, Celia has taken the first step toward placing a 
value on each of the assets.
Timing
In addition to making cash flow estimates, we must know the timing of the cash 
flows.2
 For example, Celia expects the cash flows of $2,000, $4,000, and 
$10,000 for the oil well to occur at the ends of years 1, 2, and 4, respectively. 
The combination of the cash flow and its timing fully defines the return ex￾pected from the asset.

return to determine the worth

2. Although cash flows can occur at any time during a year, for computational convenience as well as custom, we 
will assume that they occur at the end of the year unless otherwise noted.292 PART 3   Valuation of Securities
Risk and Required Return
The level of risk associated with a given cash flow can significantly affect its 
value. In general, the greater the risk of (or the less certain) a cash flow, the lower 
its value. Greater risk can be incorporated into a valuation analysis by using a 
higher required return or discount rate. The higher the risk, the greater the re￾quired return, and the lower the risk, the less the required return.
Let’s return to Celia Sargent’s task of placing a value on the 
original painting and consider two scenarios.
Scenario 1: Certainty A major art gallery has contracted to buy the painting 
for $85,000 at the end of 5 years. Because this contract is considered a certain 
situation, Celia views this asset as “money in the bank.” She thus would use 
the prevailing risk-free rate of 3% as the required return when calculating the 
value of the painting.
Scenario 2: High risk The values of original paintings by this artist have fluc￾tuated widely over the past 10 years. Although Celia expects to be able to sell 
the painting for $85,000, she realizes that its sale price in 5 years could range 
between $30,000 and $140,000. Because of the high uncertainty surrounding 
the painting’s value, Celia believes that a 15% required return is appropriate.
These two estimates of the appropriate required return illustrate how this rate 
captures risk. The often subjective nature of such estimates is also evident.
BASIC VALuATION MOdEL
Simply stated, the value of any asset is the present value of all future cash flows it is 
expected to provide over the relevant time period. The time period can be any length, 
even infinity. The value of an asset is therefore determined by discounting the expected 
cash flows back to their present value, using the required return commensurate with 
the asset’s risk as the appropriate discount rate. Using the present value techniques 
explained in Chapter 5, we can express the value of any asset at time zero, V0
, as

V0 =
CF1
(1 + r)

(1 + r)

(6.4)
where
V0 = value of the asset at time zero
CFt = cash flow expected at the end of year t
r = appropriate required return (discount rate)
n = relevant time period
We can use Equation 6.4 to determine the value of any asset.
Celia Sargent uses Equation 6.4 to calculate the value of each as￾set. She values Michaels Enterprises stock using Equation 5.7 on 
page 227, which says that the present value of a perpetuity equals the annual 
IRF Personal Finance Example 6.6 ▶ChAPTER 6   Interest Rates and Bond Valuation 293
payment divided by the required return. In the case of Michaels stock, the annual 
cash flow is $300, and Celia decides that a 12% discount rate is appropriate for this 
investment. Therefore, her estimate of the value of Michaels Enterprises stock is
$300 , 0.12 = $2,500
Next, Celia values the oil well investment, which she believes is the most 
risky of the three investments. Using a 20% required return, Celia estimates the 
oil well’s value to be
$2,000
(1 + 0.20)1
+
$4,000
(1 + 0.20)2
+
$10,000
(1 + 0.20)4
= $9,266.98
Finally, Celia estimates the value of the painting by discounting the expected 
$85,000 lump sum payment in 5 years at 15%:
$85,000 , (1 + 0.15)5 = $42,260.02
Note that, regardless of the pattern of the expected cash flow from an asset, 
the basic valuation equation can be used to determine its value.

6.4 Bond Valuation
The basic valuation equation can be customized for use in valuing specific securities: 
bonds, common stock, and preferred stock. We describe bond valuation in this chap￾ter, and valuation of common stock and preferred stock are discussed in Chapter 7.
BONd FuNdAMENTALS
As noted earlier in this chapter, bonds are long-term debt instruments used by busi￾ness and government to raise large sums of money, typically from a diverse group 
of lenders. Most corporate bonds pay interest semiannually (every 6 months) at a 
stated coupon interest rate, have an initial maturity of 10 to 30 years, and have a 
par value, or face value, of $1,000 that must be repaid at maturity.
Mills Company, a large defense contractor, on January 1, 2014, issued a 10% cou￾pon interest rate, 10-year bond with a $1,000 par value that pays interest annually. 
Investors who buy this bond receive the contractual right to two cash flows: 
(1) $100 annual interest (10% coupon interest rate * $1,000 par value) distributed 
at the end of each year and (2) the $1,000 par value at the end of the tenth year.
Example 6.7 ▶
LG 5 LG 6294 PART 3   Valuation of Securities
We will use data for Mills’s bond issue to look at basic bond valuation.
BASIC BONd VALuATION
The value of a bond is the present value of the payments its issuer is contractually 
obligated to make, from the current time until it matures. The basic model for the 
value, B0

where
B0 = value of the bond at time zero
I = annual interest paid in dollars
n = number of years to maturity
M = par value in dollars
rd = required return on the bond
We can calculate bond value by using Equation 6.5 and a financial calculator or 
by using a spreadsheet.
Tim Sanchez wishes to determine the current value of the Mills 
Company bond. Assuming that interest on the Mills Company 
bond issue is paid annually and that the required return is equal to the bond’s 
coupon interest rate, I = $100,rd = 10,, M = $1,000, and n = 10 years.
The computations involved in finding the bond value are depicted graphi￾cally on the following time line.

3. Note that because bonds pay interest in arrears, the prices at which they are quoted and traded reflect their value 
plus any accrued interest. For example, a $1,000 par value, 10% coupon bond paying interest semiannually and 
having a calculated value of $900 would pay interest of $50 at the end of each 6-month period. If it is now 3 months 
since the beginning of the interest period, three-sixths of the $50 interest, or $25 (that is, 3/6 * $50), would be ac￾crued. The bond would therefore be quoted at $925: its $900 value plus the $25 in accrued interest. For conve￾nience, throughout this book, bond values will always be assumed to be calculated at the beginning of the interest 
period, thereby avoiding the need to consider accrued interest.
Calculator use using the Mills Company’s inputs shown at the left, you should 
find the bond value to be exactly $1,000. Note that the calculated bond value is 
equal to its par value, which will always be the case when the required return is 
equal to the coupon interest rate.

Spreadsheet use The value of the Mills Company bond also can be calculated as 
shown in the following Excel spreadsheet.
BONd VALuE BEhAVIOR
In practice, the value of a bond in the marketplace is rarely equal to its par 
value. In the bond data (see Table 6.2 on page 287), you can see that the 
prices of bonds often differ from their par values of 100 (100 percent of par, 
or $1,000). Some bonds are valued below par (current price below 100), and 
others are valued above par (current price above 100). A variety of forces in 
the economy, as well as the passage of time, tend to affect value. Although 
these external forces are in no way controlled by bond issuers or investors, it 
is useful to understand the impact that required return and time to maturity 
have on bond value.
Required Returns and Bond Values
Whenever the required return on a bond differs from the bond’s coupon inter￾est rate, the bond’s value will differ from its par value. The required return is 
likely to differ from the coupon interest rate because either (1) economic con￾ditions have changed since the bond was issued, causing a shift in the cost of 
funds; or (2) the firm’s risk has changed. Increases in the cost of funds or in 
risk will raise the required return; decreases in the cost of funds or in risk will 
lower the required return.

discount
The amount by which a bond 
sells below its par value.
Regardless of the exact cause, what is important is the relationship between 
the required return and the coupon interest rate: When the required return is 
greater than the coupon interest rate, the bond value, B0
, will be less than its par 
value, M. In this case, the bond is said to sell at a discount, which will equal 
M - B0
. When the required return falls below the coupon interest rate, the bond 
value will be greater than par. In this situation, the bond is said to sell at a 
premium, which will equal B0 - M.
The preceding example showed that when the required return equaled the cou￾pon interest rate, the bond’s value equaled its $1,000 par value. If for the same 
bond the required return were to rise to 12% or fall to 8%, its value in each case 
could be found using Equation 6.5 or as follows.
Calculator use Using the inputs shown at the left for the two different 
required returns, you will find the value of the bond to be below or above par. 
At a 12% required return, the bond would sell at a discount of $113.00 
($1,000 par value - $887.00 value). At the 8% required return, the bond 
would sell for a premium of $134.20 ($1,134.20 value - $1,000 par value). 
The results of these calculations for Mills Company’s bond values 
are summarized in Table 6.6 and graphically depicted in Figure 6.4. The 
inverse relationship between bond value and required return is clearly shown 
in the figure.
Spreadsheet use The values for the Mills Company bond at required returns of 
12% and 8% also can be calculated as shown in the following Excel spread￾sheet. Once this spreadsheet has been configured, you can compare bond values 
for any two required returns by simply changing the input values.

Time to Maturity and Bond Values
Whenever the required return is different from the coupon interest rate, the 
amount of time to maturity affects bond value. An additional factor is whether 
required returns are constant or change over the life of the bond.
Constant Required Returns When the required return is different from the 
coupon interest rate and is constant until maturity, the value of the bond will ap￾proach its par value as the passage of time moves the bond’s value closer to ma￾turity. (Of course, when the required return equals the coupon interest rate, the 
bond’s value will remain at par until it matures.)

returns—12%, 10%, and 8%—is assumed to remain constant over the 10 years 
to the bond’s maturity. The bond’s value at both 12% and 8% approaches and 
ultimately equals the bond’s $1,000 par value at its maturity, as the discount (at 
12%) or premium (at 8%) declines with the passage of time.
Changing Required Returns The chance that interest rates will change and 
thereby change the required return and bond value is called interest rate risk.
4
Bondholders are typically more concerned with rising interest rates because a rise in 
interest rates, and therefore in the required return, causes a decrease in bond value. 
The shorter the amount of time until a bond’s maturity, the less responsive is its 
market value to a given change in the required return. In other words, short ma￾turities have less interest rate risk than long maturities when all other features (cou￾pon interest rate, par value, and interest payment frequency) are the same. This 
statement is true because of the mathematics of time value; the present values of 
short-term cash flows change far less than the present values of longer-term cash 
flows in response to a given change in the discount rate (required return).
The effect of changing required returns on bonds with differing maturities can be il￾lustrated by using Mills Company’s bond and Figure 6.5. If the required return rises 
from 10% to 12% when the bond has 8 years to maturity (see the dashed line at 8 
years), the bond’s value decreases from $1,000 to $901, which is a 9.9% decrease. If 
the same change in required return had occurred with only 3 years to maturity (see 
the dashed line at 3 years), the bond’s value would have dropped to just $952, only a 
4.8% decrease. Similar types of responses can be seen for the change in bond value 
Example 6.11 ▶
4. A more robust measure of a bond’s response to interest rate changes is duration. Duration measures the sensitivity of 
a bond’s prices to changing interest rates. It incorporates both the interest rate (coupon rate) and the time to maturity 
into a single statistic. Duration is simply a weighted average of the maturity of the present values of all the contractual 
cash flows yet to be paid by the bond. Duration is stated in years, so a bond with a 5-year duration will decrease in value 
by 5 percent if interest rates rise by 1 percent or will increase in value by 5 percent if interest rates fall by 1 percent.

The chance that interest rates 
will change and thereby

result in decreasing bond 
values, are of greatest concern.

less the impact on bond value caused by a given change in the required return.
YIELd TO MATuRITY (YTM)
When investors evaluate bonds, they commonly consider yield to maturity (YTM), 
which is the compound annual rate of return earned on a debt security purchased 
on a given day and held to maturity. (The measure assumes, of course, that the is￾suer makes all scheduled interest and principal payments as promised.)5
 The yield 
to maturity on a bond with a current price equal to its par value (that is, B0 = M) 
will always equal the coupon interest rate. When the bond value differs from par, 
the yield to maturity will differ from the coupon interest rate.
Assuming that interest is paid annually, the yield to maturity on a bond can 
be found by solving Equation 6.5 for rd
. In other words, the current value, the 
annual interest, the par value, and the number of years to maturity are known, 
and the required return must be found. The required return is the bond’s yield to 
maturity. The YTM can be found by using a financial calculator, by using an 
Excel spreadsheet, or by trial and error. The calculator provides accurate YTM 
values with minimum effort.
Earl Washington wishes to find the YTM on Mills Compa￾ny’s bond. The bond currently sells for $1,080, has a 10% 
coupon interest rate and $1,000 par value, pays interest annually, and has 
10 years to maturity.
Calculator use Most calculators require either the present value (B0
 in this case) 
or the future values (I and M in this case) to be input as negative numbers to cal￾culate yield to maturity. That approach is employed here. Using the inputs shown 
at the left, you should find the YTM to be 8.766%.
Spreadsheet use The yield to maturity of Mills Company’s bond also can be calcu￾lated as shown in the Excel spreadsheet at the top of the next page. First, enter all the 
bond’s cash flows. Note that you begin with the bond’s price as an outflow (a nega￾tive number). In other words, an investor has to pay the price up front to receive the 
cash flows over the next 10 years. Next, use Excel’s internal rate of return function. 
This function calculates the discount rate that makes the present value of a series of 
cash flows equal to zero. In this case, when the present value of all cash flows is zero, 
the present value of the inflows (interest and principal) equals the present value of the 
outflows (the bond’s initial price). In other words, the internal rate of return function 
is giving us the bond’s YTM, the discount rate that equates the bond’s price to the 
present value of its cash flows.
Since the typical bond’s interest payments form an annuity stream you can 
further reduce the work necessary to solve for a bond’s yield to maturity using 
Excel. The second screenshot on the next page shows how to use the RATE func￾tion in Excel to determine a bond’s yield to maturity.
Personal Finance Example 6.12 ▶
5. Many bonds have a call feature, which means that they may not reach maturity if the issuer, after a specified time 
period, calls them back. Because the call feature typically cannot be exercised until a specific future date, investors 
often calculate the yield to call (YTC). The yield to call represents the rate of return that investors earn if they buy a 
callable bond at a specific price and hold it until it is called back and they receive the call price, which would be set 
above the bond’s par value. Here our focus is solely on the more general measure of yield to maturity.

SEMIANNuAL INTEREST ANd BONd VALuES
The procedure used to value bonds paying interest semiannually is similar to that 
shown in Chapter 5 for compounding interest more frequently than annually, 
except that here we need to find present value instead of future value. It involves 
the following changes:
 1. Converting annual interest, I, to semiannual interest by dividing I by 2.
 2. Converting the number of years to maturity, n, to the number of 6-month 
periods to maturity by multiplying n by 2.
 3. Converting the required stated (rather than effective)6
 annual return for sim￾ilar-risk bonds that also pay semiannual interest from an annual rate, rd
, to a 
semiannual rate by dividing rd
 by 2.
6. As we noted in Chapter 5, the effective annual rate of interest, EAR, for stated interest rate r, when interest is paid 
semiannually (m 5 2), can be found by using Equation 5.10:
EAR = a1 +

Because most bonds pay semiannual interest at semiannual rates equal to 50 percent of the stated annual rate, their 
effective annual rates are generally higher than their stated annual rates.

Calculator use In using a calculator to find bond value when interest is paid semian￾nually, we must double the number of periods and divide both the required stated 
annual return and the annual interest by 2. For the Mills Company bond, we would 
use 20 periods (2 * 10 years), a required return of 6% (12% , 2), and an interest 
payment of $50 ($100 , 2). Using these inputs, you should find the bond value with 
semiannual interest to be $885.30, as shown at the left.
Spreadsheet use The value of the Mills Company bond paying semiannual inter￾est at a required return of 12% also can be calculated as shown in the following 
Excel spreadsheet.
Comparing this result with the $887.00 value found earlier for annual com￾pounding, we can see that the bond’s value is lower when semiannual interest is 
paid. This situation will always occur when the bond sells at a discount. For 
bonds selling at a premium, the opposite will occur: The value with semiannual 
interest will be greater than with annual interest.

Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
Interest rates and required returns embody the real cost of money, inflationary 
expectations, and issuer and issue risk. They reflect the level of return required 
by market participants as compensation for the risk perceived in a specific secu￾rity or asset investment. Because these returns are affected by economic expecta￾tions, they vary as a function of time, typically rising for longer-term maturities. 
The yield curve reflects such market expectations at any point in time.
The value of an asset can be found by calculating the present value of its ex￾pected cash flows, using the required return as the discount rate. Bonds are the easi￾est financial assets to value; both the amounts and the timing of their cash flows are 
contractual and therefore known with certainty (at least for high-grade bonds). The 
financial manager needs to understand how to apply valuation techniques to bonds, 
stocks, and tangible assets (as we will demonstrate in the following chapters) to 
make decisions that are consistent with the firm’s share price maximization goal.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
LG 1 Describe interest rate fundamentals, the term structure of interest rates, and 
risk premiums. The flow of funds between savers and borrowers is regulated by the 
interest rate or required return. In a perfect, inflation-free, certain world there would 
be one cost of money: the real rate of interest. The nominal or actual interest rate is ChAPTER 6   Interest Rates and Bond Valuation 303
the sum of the risk-free rate and a risk premium reflecting issuer and issue character￾istics. The risk-free rate is the real rate of interest plus an inflation premium.
For any class of similar-risk bonds, the term structure of interest rates reflects 
the relationship between the interest rate or rate of return and the time to matu￾rity. Yield curves can be downward sloping (inverted), upward sloping (normal), 
or flat. The expectations theory, liquidity preference theory, and market segmen￾tation theory are cited to explain the shape of the yield curve. Risk premiums for 
non-Treasury debt issues result from business risk, financial risk, interest rate risk, 
liquidity risk, tax risk, default risk, maturity risk, and contractual provision risk.
LG 2 Review the legal aspects of bond financing and bond cost. Corporate bonds 
are long-term debt instruments indicating that a corporation has borrowed an 
amount that it promises to repay in the future under clearly defined terms. Most 
bonds are issued with maturities of 10 to 30 years and a par value of $1,000. The 
bond indenture, enforced by a trustee, states all conditions of the bond issue. It con￾tains both standard debt provisions and restrictive covenants, which may include a 
sinking-fund requirement and/or a security interest. The cost of a bond to an issuer 
depends on its maturity, offering size, and issuer risk and on the basic cost of money.
LG 3 Discuss the general features, yields, prices, ratings, popular types, and inter￾national issues of corporate bonds. A bond issue may include a conversion fea￾ture, a call feature, or stock purchase warrants. The yield, or rate of return, on a 
bond can be measured by its current yield, yield to maturity (YTM), or yield to 
call (YTC). Bond prices are typically reported along with their coupon, maturity 
date, and yield to maturity (YTM). Bond ratings by independent agencies indicate 
the risk of a bond issue. Various types of traditional and contemporary bonds are 
available. Eurobonds and foreign bonds enable established creditworthy compa￾nies and governments to borrow large amounts internationally.
LG 4 Understand the key inputs and basic model used in the bond valuation pro￾cess. Key inputs to the valuation process include cash flows (returns), timing, and 
risk and the required return. The value of any asset is equal to the present value of 
all future cash flows it is expected to provide over the relevant time period.
LG 5 Apply the basic valuation model to bonds, and describe the impact of required 
return and time to maturity on bond values. The value of a bond is the present value 
of its interest payments plus the present value of its par value. The discount rate used 
to determine bond value is the required return, which may differ from the bond’s 
coupon interest rate. A bond can sell at a discount, at par, or at a premium, depend￾ing on whether the required return is greater than, equal to, or less than its coupon 
interest rate. The amount of time to maturity affects bond values. The value of a 
bond will approach its par value as the bond moves closer to maturity. The chance 
that interest rates will change and thereby change the required return and bond value 
is called interest rate risk. The shorter the amount of time until a bond’s maturity, the 
less responsive is its market value to a given change in the required return.
LG 6 Explain yield to maturity (YTM), its calculation, and the procedure used 
to value bonds that pay interest semiannually. Yield to maturity is the rate of re￾turn investors earn if they buy a bond at a specific price and hold it until matu￾rity. YTM can be calculated by using a financial calculator or by using an Excel 304 PART 3   Valuation of Securities
Opener-in-Review
In the chapter opener, you learned that the U.S. government had more than 
$16 trillion in debt outstanding in the form of Treasury bills, notes, and bonds 
in 2013. From time to time, the Treasury changes the mix of securities that it 
issues to finance government debt, issuing more bills than bonds or vice versa.
a. With short-term interest rates near 0 percent in 2013, suppose that the Treasury 
decided to replace maturing notes and bonds by issuing new Treasury bills, thus 
shortening the average maturity of U.S. debt outstanding. Discuss the pros and 
cons of this strategy.
b. The average maturity of outstanding U.S. Treasury debt is a little more than 
5 years. Suppose that a newly issued 5-year Treasury note has a coupon rate of 
2 percent and sells at par. What happens to the value of this bond if the inflation 
rate rises 1 percentage point, causing the yield-to-maturity on the 5-year note to 
jump to 3 percent shortly after it is issued?
c. Assume that the “average” Treasury security outstanding has the features de￾scribed in part b. If total U.S. debt is $16 trillion and an increase in inflation 
causes yields on Treasury securities to increase by 1 percentage point, by how 
much would the market value of the outstanding debt fall? What does that sug￾gest about the incentives of government policy makers to pursue policies that 
could lead to higher inflation?

information to investors.
mAnAgement  You need to understand the difference between debt and equity 
capital, the rights and claims of stockholders, the process of issuing common 
stock, and the effects each functional area has on the value of the firm’s stock.
mArketing  You need to understand that the firm’s ideas for products and 
services will greatly affect investors’ beliefs regarding the likely success of the 
firm’s projects and that projects that are viewed as more likely to succeed are 
also viewed as more valuable and therefore lead to a higher stock value.
operAtionS  You need to understand that the evaluations of venture capitalists 
and other would-be investors will in part depend on the efficiency of the firm’s 
operations and that more cost-efficient operations lead to better growth prospects 
and therefore higher stock valuations.
In your personal life At some point, you are likely to hold stocks as 
an asset in your retirement program. You may 
want to estimate a stock’s value. if the stock is selling below its estimated value, 
you may buy the stock; if its market price is above its value, you may sell it. Some 
individuals rely on financial advisors to make such buy or sell recommendations. 
regardless of how you approach investment decisions, it will be helpful for you to 
understand how stocks are valued.Going Green to Find Value
O
ne of the most “hotly” debated topics of our day 
has been the issue of global warming and the 
benefits and costs of lower emissions. Many companies 
are investing in radical new technologies with the hope 
of capitalizing on the going green movement. On June 
29, 2010, Tesla Motors raised $226 million in its 
initial public offering (IPO) of common stock. Tesla, 
whose shares trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange, 
was the first automaker to use lithium ion batteries to 
produce an all-electric vehicle with a range of more 
than 200 miles. Even though Tesla racked up losses of 
$279 million from 2006 to 2009 and had never been 
profitable, investors were enthusiastic about the IPO, 
and Tesla’s stock price rose from $17 to $24 on its first 
day of trading.
Excitement about Tesla’s prospects was fueled in 
part by its mission to reduce carbon emissions and in 
part by its charismatic cofounder, Elon Musk, who had 
previously started several successful companies, including 
PayPal. It also helped that the federal government offered 
a tax subsidy of $7,500 to anyone who purchased an electric vehicle, and some states offered 
additional tax incentives. In its first 2 years as a public company, Tesla continued to struggle to 
become profitable, but its stock price gradually trended upward. In 2013, Tesla reported its first 
quarterly profit as well as its first quarter of positive cash flow. Just days after that news hit the 
markets, Consumer Reports announced that Tesla’s sedan, the Model S, was the best car it had ever 
tested, receiving the highest score in the magazine’s history, a 99 out of 100. From May 8 to May 
13, the company’s stock rose 57 percent! In the long run, Tesla’s stock price will depend on its 
ability to generate positive cash flows, without the help of government subsidies, and convince the 
market of its ability to do so into the future.

7.1 differences between debt and Equity
Although debt and equity capital are both sources of external financing used by 
firms, they are very different in several important respects. Most importantly, 
debt financing is obtained from creditors, and equity financing is obtained from 
investors who then become part owners of the firm. Creditors (lenders or debt￾holders) have a legal right to be repaid, whereas investors have only an expecta￾tion of being repaid. Debt includes all borrowing incurred by a firm, including 
bonds, and is repaid according to a fixed schedule of payments. Equity consists of 
funds provided by the firm’s owners (investors or stockholders), and the stock￾holders earn a return that is not guaranteed but is tied to the firm’s performance. 
A firm can obtain equity either internally, by retaining earnings rather than pay￾ing them out as dividends to its stockholders, or externally, by selling common or 
preferred stock. The key differences between debt and equity capital are summa￾rized in Table 7.1 and discussed in the following pages.
VOICE IN MANAGEMENT
Unlike creditors, holders of equity (stockholders) are owners of the firm. Stock￾holders generally have voting rights that permit them to select the firm’s directors 
and vote on special issues. In contrast, debtholders do not receive voting privileges 
but instead rely on the firm’s contractual obligations to them to be their voice.
CLAIMS ON INCOME ANd ASSETS
Equityholders’ claims on income and assets are secondary to the claims of credi￾tors. Their claims on income cannot be paid until the claims of all creditors, in￾cluding both interest and scheduled principal payments, have been satisfied. After 
satisfying creditor’s claims, the firm’s board of directors decides whether to dis￾tribute dividends to the owners.
Matter of fact
A
ccording to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, in bankruptcy assets are divided 
 up as follows:
1. Secured creditors: Secured bank loans or secured bonds are paid first.
2. Unsecured creditors: Unsecured bank loans or unsecured bonds, suppliers, or customers 
have the next claim.
3. Equityholders: Equityholders or the owners of the company have the last claim on assets, 
and they may not receive anything if the secured and unsecured creditors’ claims are not 
fully repaid.
How Are Assets Divided in Bankruptcy?
LG 1
debt
Includes all borrowing incurred 
by a firm, including bonds, 
and is repaid according to a 
fixed schedule of payments.
equity
Funds provided by the firm’s 
owners (investors or stockholders) 
that are repaid subject to the 
firm’s performance.
Equityholders’ claims on assets also are secondary to the claims of creditors. 
If the firm fails, its assets are sold, and the proceeds are distributed in this order: 
secured creditors, unsecured creditors, and equityholders. Because equityholders 
are the last to receive any distribution of assets, their investment is relatively 
risky, and they expect greater returns from their investment in the firm’s stock 
than the returns creditors require on the firm’s borrowings. The higher rate of ChAPTER 7   Stock Valuation 319
return expected by equityholders means that there is a higher cost of equity fi￾nancing relative to the cost of debt financing for the firm.
MATuRITY
Unlike debt, equity is a permanent form of financing for the firm. It does not 
“mature,” so repayment is not required. When they purchase shares, stockhold￾ers must recognize that, although a ready market may exist for their shares, the 
price of the shares will fluctuate over time, and there is no way to know what 
the share price will be when an investor is ready to sell. This fluctuation of the 
market price of equity makes the overall returns to a firm’s stockholders even 
more risky.
TAx TREATMENT
Interest payments to debtholders are treated as tax-deductible expenses by the 
issuing firm, whereas dividend payments to a firm’s stockholders are not tax de￾ductible. The tax deductibility of interest lowers the corporation’s cost of debt 
financing, which is yet another reason the cost of debt financing is lower than the 
cost of equity financing.
➔ REVIEW QuESTION
 7–1 What are the key differences between debt and equity?
7.2 Common and Preferred Stock
A firm can obtain equity capital by selling either common or preferred stock. All 
corporations initially issue common stock to raise equity capital. Some of these 
firms later issue either additional common stock or preferred stock to raise more 
equity capital. Although both common and preferred stock are forms of equity 
capital, preferred stock has some similarities to debt that significantly differenti￾ate it from common stock. Here we first consider the features of both common 
and preferred stock and then describe the process of issuing common stock, in￾cluding the use of venture capital.

TABLE 7.1320 PART 3   Valuation of Securities
COMMON STOCK
The true owners of a corporate business are the common stockholders. Common 
stockholders are sometimes referred to as residual owners because they receive 
what is left—the residual—after all other claims on the firm’s income and assets 
have been satisfied. They are assured of only one thing: that they cannot lose any 
more than they have invested in the firm. As a result of this generally uncertain 
position, common stockholders expect to earn relatively high returns. Those re￾turns may come in the form of dividends, capital gains, or both.
Ownership
The common stock of a firm can be privately owned by private investors or pub￾licly owned by public investors. Private companies are usually smaller than public 
companies and they are often closely owned by an individual investor or a small 
group of private investors (such as a family). Public companies are widely owned
by many unrelated individual or institutional investors. The shares of privately 
owned firms generally do not trade actively in the stock market; if the shares are 
traded, the transactions are among private investors and often require the firm’s 
consent. Large corporations, which are emphasized in the following discussions, 
are publicly owned, and their shares are generally actively traded in the stock 
markets described in Chapter 2.
Par Value
The market value of common stock is completely unrelated to its par value. The 
par value of common stock is an arbitrary value established for legal purposes in 
the firm’s corporate charter and is generally set quite low, often an amount of $1 
or less. Recall that when a firm sells new shares of common stock, the par value 
of the shares sold is recorded in the capital section of the balance sheet as part of 
common stock. One benefit of this recording is that at any time the total number 
of shares of common stock outstanding can be found by dividing the book value 
of common stock by the par value.
Setting a low par value is advantageous in states where certain corporate 
taxes are based on the par value of stock. A low par value is also beneficial in 
states that have laws against selling stock at a discount to par. For example, a 
company whose common stock has a par value of $20 per share would be unable 
to issue stock if investors are unwilling to pay more than $16 per share.
Preemptive Rights
The preemptive right allows common stockholders to maintain their proportion￾ate ownership in the corporation when new shares are issued, thus protecting 
them from dilution of their ownership. A dilution of ownership is a reduction in 
each previous shareholder’s fractional ownership resulting from the issuance of 
additional shares of common stock. Preemptive rights allow preexisting share￾holders to maintain their preissuance voting control and protects them against 
the dilution of earnings. Preexisting shareholders experience a dilution of earn￾ings when their claim on the firm’s earnings is diminished as a result of new 
shares being issued.
In a rights offering, the firm grants rights to its shareholders. These financial 
instruments allow stockholders to purchase additional shares at a price below the

market price, in direct proportion to their number of owned shares. In these situ￾ations, rights are an important financing tool without which shareholders would 
run the risk of losing their proportionate control of the corporation. From the 
firm’s viewpoint, the use of rights offerings to raise new equity capital may be less 
costly than a public offering of stock.
Authorized, Outstanding, and Issued Shares
A firm’s corporate charter indicates how many authorized shares it can issue. 
The firm cannot sell more shares than the charter authorizes without obtain￾ing approval through a shareholder vote. To avoid later having to amend the 
charter, firms generally attempt to authorize more shares than they initially 
plan to issue.
Authorized shares become outstanding shares when they are issued or sold to 
investors. If the firm repurchases any of its outstanding shares, these shares are 
recorded as treasury stock and are no longer considered to be outstanding shares. 
Issued shares are the shares of common stock that have been put into circulation; 
they represent the sum of outstanding shares and treasury stock.
Golden Enterprises, a producer of medical pumps, has the following stockhold￾ers’ equity account on December 31:
Stockholders’ Equity
Common stock—$0.80 par value:
Authorized 35,000,000 shares; issued 15,000,000 shares $ 12,000,000
Paid-in capital in excess of par 63,000,000
Retained earnings 31,000,000
 $106,000,000
Less: Cost of treasury stock (1,000,000 shares) 4,000,000
Total stockholders’ equity $102,000,000
How many shares of additional common stock can Golden sell without gain￾ing approval from its shareholders? The firm has 35 million authorized shares, 
15 million issued shares, and 1 million shares of treasury stock. Thus, 14 million 
shares are outstanding (15 million issued shares minus 1 million shares of trea￾sury stock), and Golden can issue 21 million additional shares (35 million autho￾rized shares minus 14 million outstanding shares) without seeking shareholder 
approval. This total includes the treasury shares currently held, which the firm 
can reissue to the public without obtaining shareholder approval.
Voting Rights
Generally, each share of common stock entitles its holder to one vote in the elec￾tion of directors and on special issues. Votes are generally assignable and may be 
cast at the annual stockholders’ meeting.
Because most small stockholders do not attend the annual meeting to 
vote, they may sign a proxy statement transferring their votes to another 
party. The solicitation of proxies from shareholders is closely controlled by 
the Securities and Exchange Commission to ensure that proxies are not being

solicited on the basis of false or misleading information. Existing manage￾ment generally receives the stockholders’ proxies because it is able to solicit 
them at company expense.
Occasionally, when the firm is widely owned, outsiders may wage a proxy 
battle to unseat the existing management and gain control of the firm. To win a 
corporate election, votes from a majority of the shares voted are required. His￾torically, the odds of an outside group winning a proxy battle were generally 
slim, but that has changed in recent years. Investors such as Carl Icahn have had 
repeated success gaining seats on boards of directors and affecting corporate pol￾icies in other ways through proxy rights.
Rather than trying to gain control of the firm through a proxy fight, share￾holders can simply make proposals that may be voted on at a shareholders meet￾ing. Even in very large firms, these proposals can sometimes be effective. In 2011, 
for instance, shareholders of Standard & Poor’s 500 firms put forward 347 pro￾posals, of which 16.1% received majority support.
In recent years, many firms, including household names like Google and 
Facebook, have issued two or more classes of common stock with unequal voting 
rights. A firm can use different classes of stock as a defense against a hostile take￾over in which an outside group, without management support, tries to gain vot￾ing control of the firm by buying its shares in the marketplace. Supervoting 
shares, which have multiple votes per share, allow “insiders” to maintain control 
against an outside group whose shares have only one vote each. At other times, a 
class of nonvoting common stock is issued when the firm wishes to raise capital 
through the sale of common stock but does not want to give up its voting control.
When different classes of common stock are issued on the basis of unequal 
voting rights, class A common typically—but not universally—has one vote per 
share, and class B common has supervoting rights. In most cases, the multiple 
share classes are equal with respect to all other aspects of ownership, although 
there are some exceptions to this general rule. In particular, there is usually no 
difference in the distribution of earnings (dividends) and assets. Treasury stock, 
which is held within the corporation, generally does not have voting rights, does 
not earn dividends, and does not have a claim on assets in liquidation.
dividends
The payment of dividends to the firm’s shareholders is at the discretion of the 
company’s board of directors. Most corporations that pay dividends pay them 
quarterly. Dividends may be paid in cash, stock, or merchandise. Cash dividends 
are the most common, merchandise dividends the least.
Common stockholders are not promised a dividend, but they come to expect 
certain payments on the basis of the historical dividend pattern of the firm. Be￾fore firms pay dividends to common stockholders, they must pay any past due 
dividends owed to preferred stockholders. The firm’s ability to pay dividends can 
be affected by restrictive debt covenants designed to ensure that the firm can re￾pay its creditors.
Since passage of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003,
many firms now pay larger dividends to shareholders, who are subject to a maxi￾mum tax rate of 20 percent on dividends rather than the maximum tax rate of 
39.6 percent on other forms of income. Because of the importance of the dividend 
decision to the growth and valuation of the firm, dividends are discussed in 
greater detail in Chapter 14.

International Stock Issues
Although the international market for common stock is not as large as the inter￾national market for bonds, cross-border issuance and trading of common stock 
have increased dramatically in the past 30 years.
Some corporations issue stock in foreign markets. For example, the stock of 
General Electric trades in Frankfurt, London, Paris, and Tokyo; the stocks 
of Time Warner and Microsoft trade in Frankfurt and London; and the stock of 
McDonald’s trades in Frankfurt, London, and Paris. The Frankfurt, London, and 
Tokyo markets are the most popular. Issuing stock internationally broadens the 
ownership base and helps a company integrate into the local business environ￾ment. Having locally traded stock can facilitate corporate acquisitions because 
shares can be used as an acceptable method of payment.
Foreign corporations have also discovered the benefits of trading their stock 
in the United States. The disclosure and reporting requirements mandated by the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have historically discouraged all but 
the largest foreign firms from directly listing their shares on the New York Stock 
Exchange or the American Stock Exchange.
As an alternative, most foreign companies choose to tap the U.S. market 
through American depositary shares (ADSs). These shares are dollar-denomi￾nated receipts for the stocks of foreign companies that are held by a U.S. financial 
institution overseas. They serve as backing for American depositary receipts 
(ADRs), which are securities that permit U.S. investors to hold shares of non-U.S. 
companies and trade them in U.S. markets. Because ADRs are issued, in dollars, 
to U.S. investors, they are subject to U.S. securities laws. At the same time, they 
give investors the opportunity to diversify their portfolios internationally.
PREFERREd STOCK
Most corporations do not issue preferred stock, but preferred shares are common in 
some industries. Preferred stock gives its holders certain privileges that make them 
senior to common stockholders. Preferred stockholders are promised a fixed peri￾odic dividend, which is stated either as a percentage or as a dollar amount. How the 
dividend is specified depends on whether the preferred stock has a par value.

Matter of fact
A
careful analysis of how firms responded to the dividend tax cuts contained in the 2003 Jobs 
 and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act found that firms dramatically increased dividends 
soon after that law was passed. One interesting comparison involved the tendency of firms that 
had never paid dividends to start paying them. In the quarters leading up to the tax cut, only 
about 4 firms per quarter began paying dividends, but in the quarters immediately following the 
passage of the new tax law, 29 firms per quarter announced that they would start paying 
dividends. Similar increases occurred in firms that already paid dividends, with nearly 50 percent 
of all dividend-paying firms announcing that they would increase their dividend payments by 
20 percent or more after the tax cut became law. There was, however, an important confounding 
factor: Corporate earnings jumped at the same time, so whether dividends rose due to tax policy 
or due to improving corporate profits remains a matter of debate.
Did Tax Cuts Stimulate Dividends?324 PART 3   Valuation of Securities
Par-value preferred stock has a stated face value, and its annual dividend is specified 
as a percentage of this value. No-par preferred stock has no stated face value, but its 
annual dividend is stated in dollars. Preferred stock is most often issued by public 
utilities, by financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies, by acquir￾ing firms in merger transactions, and by young firms receiving investment funds 
from venture capital firms. Like the dividends on common stock, preferred divi￾dends are not tax deductible for the firm that pays them.
Basic Rights of Preferred Stockholders
The basic rights of preferred stockholders are somewhat stronger than the rights 
of common stockholders. Preferred stock is often considered quasi-debt because, 
much like interest on debt, it specifies a fixed periodic payment (dividend). Pre￾ferred stock is unlike debt in that it has no maturity date. Because they have a 
fixed claim on the firm’s income that takes precedence over the claim of common 
stockholders, preferred stockholders are exposed to less risk.
Preferred stockholders are also given preference over common stockhold￾ers in the liquidation of assets in a legally bankrupt firm, although they must 
“stand in line” behind creditors. The amount of the claim of preferred stock￾holders in liquidation is normally equal to the par or stated value of the pre￾ferred stock. Preferred stockholders are not normally given a voting right, 
although preferred stockholders are sometimes allowed to elect one member 
of the board of directors.
Features of Preferred Stock
A preferred stock issue generally includes a number of features. Along with the 
stock’s par value, the amount of dividend payments, the dividend payment dates, 
and any restrictive covenants, such features are specified in an agreement similar 
to a bond indenture.
Restrictive Covenants The restrictive covenants in a preferred stock issue fo￾cus on ensuring the firm’s continued existence and regular payment of the dividend. 
These covenants include provisions about passing dividends, the sale of senior secu￾rities, mergers, sales of assets, minimum liquidity requirements, and repurchases of 
common stock. The violation of preferred stock covenants usually permits preferred 
stockholders either to obtain representation on the firm’s board of directors or to 
force the retirement of their stock at or above its par or stated value.
Cumulation Most preferred stock is cumulative with respect to any divi￾dends passed. That is, all dividends in arrears, along with the current dividend, 
must be paid before dividends can be paid to common stockholders. If preferred 
stock is noncumulative, passed (unpaid) dividends do not accumulate. In this 
case, only the current dividend must be paid before dividends can be paid to com￾mon stockholders. Because the common stockholders can receive dividends only 
after the dividend claims of preferred stockholders have been satisfied, it is in the 
firm’s best interest to pay preferred dividends when they are due.
Other Features Preferred stock can be callable or convertible. Preferred 
stock with a callable feature allows the issuer to retire outstanding shares within 
a certain period of time at a specified price. The call price is normally set above 
the initial issuance price, but it may decrease as time passes. Making preferred 
stock callable provides the issuer with a way to bring the fixed-payment commit￾ment of the preferred issue to an end if conditions make it desirable to do so.
par-value preferred stock
Preferred stock with a stated 
face value that is used with the 
specified dividend percentage 
to determine the annual dollar 
dividend.
no-par preferred stock
Preferred stock with no stated 
face value but with a stated 
annual dollar dividend.
cumulative (preferred stock)
Preferred stock for which all 
passed (unpaid) dividends in 
arrears, along with the current 
dividend, must be paid before 
dividends can be paid to 
common stockholders.
noncumulative (preferred

Preferred stock for which 
passed (unpaid) dividends do 
not accumulate.
callable feature (preferred 
stock)
A feature of callable preferred 
stock that allows the issuer to 
retire the shares within a 
certain period of time and at a 
specified price.ChAPTER 7   Stock Valuation 325
Preferred stock with a conversion feature allows holders to change each share 
into a stated number of shares of common stock, usually anytime after a prede￾termined date. The conversion ratio can be fixed, or the number of shares of 
common stock that the preferred stock can be exchanged for changes through 
time according to a predetermined formula.
ISSuING COMMON STOCK
Because of the high risk associated with a business startup, a firm’s initial financ￾ing typically comes from its founders in the form of a common stock investment. 
Until the founders have made an equity investment, it is highly unlikely that oth￾ers will contribute either equity or debt capital. Early-stage investors in the firm’s 
equity, as well as lenders who provide debt capital, want to be assured that they 
are taking no more risk than the founders. In addition, they want confirmation 
that the founders are confident enough in their vision for the firm that they are 
willing to risk their own money.
Typically, the initial nonfounder financing for business startups with attrac￾tive growth prospects comes from private equity investors. Then, as the firm es￾tablishes the viability of its product or service offering and begins to generate 
revenues, cash flow, and profits, it will often “go public” by issuing shares of 
common stock to a much broader group of investors.
Before we consider the initial public sale of equity, let’s discuss some of the key 
aspects of early-stage equity financing in firms that have attractive growth prospects.
Venture Capital
The initial external equity financing privately raised by firms, typically early￾stage firms with attractive growth prospects, is called venture capital. Those who 
provide venture capital are known as venture capitalists (VCs). They typically 
are formal business entities that maintain strong oversight over the firms they 
invest in and that have clearly defined exit strategies. Less visible early-stage in￾vestors called angel capitalists (or angels) tend to be investors who do not actu￾ally operate as a business; they are often wealthy individual investors who are 
willing to invest in promising early-stage companies in exchange for a portion of 
the firm’s equity. Although angels play a major role in early-stage equity financ￾ing, we will focus on VCs because of their more formal structure and greater 
public visibility.
Organization and Investment Stages Venture capital investors tend to be 
organized in one of four basic ways, as described in Table 7.2. The VC limited 
partnership is by far the dominant structure. These funds have as their sole objec￾tive to earn high returns rather than to obtain access to the companies so as to sell 
or buy other products or services.
VCs can invest in early-stage companies, later-stage companies, or buyouts 
and acquisitions. Generally, about 40 to 50 percent of VC investments are de￾voted to early-stage companies (for startup funding and expansion) and a similar 
percentage to later-stage companies (for marketing, production expansion, and 
preparation for public offering); the remaining 5 to 10 percent are devoted to the 
buyout or acquisition of other companies. Generally, VCs look for compound 
annual rates of return ranging from 20 to 50 percent or more, depending on both 
the development stage and the attributes of each company. Earlier-stage invest￾ments tend to demand higher returns than later-stage investments because of the 
higher risk associated with the earlier stages of a firm’s growth.

business but invest in promising 
early-stage companies in 
exchange for a portion of the

Deal Structure and Pricing Regardless of the development stage, venture capi￾tal investments are made under a legal contract that clearly allocates responsibilities 
and ownership interests between existing owners (founders) and the VC fund or lim￾ited partnership. The terms of the agreement will depend on numerous factors related 
to the founders; the business structure, stage of development, and outlook; and other 
market and timing issues. The specific financial terms will, of course, depend on the 
value of the enterprise, the amount of funding, and the perceived risk. To control the 
VC’s risk, various covenants are included in the agreement, and the actual funding 
may be pegged to the achievement of measurable milestones. The VC will negotiate 
numerous other provisions into the contract, both to ensure the firm’s success and to 
control its risk exposure. The contract will have an explicit exit strategy for the VC 
that may be tied both to measurable milestones and to time.
The amount of equity to which the VC is entitled will, of course, depend on 
the value of the firm, the terms of the contract, the exit terms, and the minimum 
compound annual rate of return required by the VC on its investment. Although 
each VC investment is unique and no standard contract exists, the transaction 
will be structured to provide the VC with a high rate of return that is consistent 
with the typically high risk of such transactions. The exit strategy of most VC 
investments is to take the firm public through an initial public offering.
Going Public
When a firm wishes to sell its stock in the primary market, it has three alternatives. 
It can make (1) a public offering, in which it offers its shares for sale to the general 
public; (2) a rights offering, in which new shares are sold to existing stockholders; 
or (3) a private placement, in which the firm sells new securities directly to an in￾vestor or group of investors. Here we focus on public offerings, particularly the 
initial public offering (IPO), which is the first public sale of a firm’s stock. IPOs are 
typically made by small, rapidly growing companies that either require additional 
capital to continue expanding or have met a milestone for going public that was 
established in a contract signed earlier to obtain VC funding.
To go public, the firm must first obtain the approval of its current sharehold￾ers, the investors who own its privately issued stock. Next, the company’s audi￾tors and lawyers must certify that all documents for the company are legitimate. 
The company then finds an investment bank willing to underwrite the offering. 
This underwriter is responsible for promoting the stock and facilitating the sale 
of the company’s IPO shares. The underwriter often brings in other investment

potential investors have access to the same information about the company—the 
information presented in the preliminary prospectus—and not to any unpub￾lished data that might give them an unfair advantage.
The investment bankers and company executives promote the company’s stock 
offering through a road show, a series of presentations to potential investors around 
the country and sometimes overseas. In addition to providing investors with informa￾tion about the new issue, road show sessions help the investment bankers gauge the 
demand for the offering and set an expected pricing range. After the underwriter sets 
terms and prices the issue, the SEC must approve the offering.
The Investment Banker’s Role
Most public offerings are made with the assistance of an investment banker. The 
investment banker is a financial intermediary (such as Morgan Stanley or Gold￾man Sachs) that specializes in selling new security issues and advising firms with 
regard to major financial transactions. The main activity of the investment banker 
is underwriting. This process involves purchasing the security issue from the issu￾ing corporation at an agreed-on price and bearing the risk of reselling it to the 
public at a profit. The investment banker also provides the issuer with advice 
about pricing and other important aspects of the issue.
In the case of very large security issues, the investment banker brings in other 
bankers as partners to form an underwriting syndicate. The syndicate shares the fi￾nancial risk associated with buying the entire issue from the issuer and reselling the 
new securities to the public. The originating investment banker and the syndicate 
members put together a selling group, normally made up of themselves and a large 
number of brokerage firms. Each member of the selling group accepts the responsi￾bility for selling a certain portion of the issue and is paid a commission on the securi￾ties it sells. The selling process for a large security issue is depicted in Figure 7.2.
Compensation for underwriting and selling services typically comes in the form 
of a discount on the sale price of the securities. For example, an investment banker 
may pay the issuing firm $24 per share for stock that will be sold for $26 per share. 
The investment banker may then sell the shares to members of the selling group for 
$25.25 per share. In this case, the original investment banker earns $1.25 per share 
($25.25 sale price minus $24 purchase price). The members of the selling group earn 
75 cents for each share they sell ($26 sale price minus $25.25 purchase price). Al￾though some primary security offerings are directly placed by the issuer, the majority 
of new issues are sold through public offering via the mechanism just described.

Common stockholders expect to be rewarded through periodic cash dividends

and sell based on a plan to maintain a broadly diversified portfolio. Other inves￾tors have a more speculative motive for trading. They try to spot companies 
whose shares are undervalued, meaning that the true value of the shares is greater 
than the current market price. These investors buy shares that they believe to be 
undervalued and sell shares that they think are overvalued (that is, the market 
price is greater than the true value). Regardless of one’s motive for trading, un￾derstanding how to value common stocks is an important part of the investment

can they work to maximize the stock price without understanding the factors that 
determine the value of the stock? In this section, we will describe specific stock 
valuation techniques. First, we will consider the relationship between market ef￾ficiency and stock valuation.
MARKET EFFICIENCY
Rational buyers and sellers use their assessment of an asset’s risk and return to 
determine its value. To a buyer, the asset’s value represents the maximum pur￾chase price, and to a seller, it represents the minimum sale price. In competitive 
markets with many active participants, such as a stock exchange, the interactions 
of many buyers and sellers result in an equilibrium price—the market value—for 
each security. This price reflects the collective actions that buyers and sellers take 
on the basis of all available information. Buyers and sellers digest new informa￾tion quickly as it becomes available and, through their purchase and sale activi￾ties, create a new market equilibrium price. Because the flow of new information 
is continual and the content of that information is unpredictable (otherwise, it 
would not be new information), stock prices fluctuate, always moving toward a 
new equilibrium that reflects the most recent information available. This general 
concept is known as market efficiency.
Matter of fact
T
he University of Michigan produces a monthly survey measuring consumer confidence, and 
that survey routinely causes stock prices to move when it is released. In June 2013, various 
news organizations reported that Thomson Reuters had a contract that allowed it to distribute 
information about the monthly consumer confidence survey to its clients, via a conference call, 
5 minutes before the survey results were posted on the university’s website. The contract contained 
another provision that allowed Thomson Reuters to distribute survey results electronically to an 
elite group of clients at 9:54:58 a.m., 2 seconds prior to the conference call. The 2 seconds of 
lead time over the rest of the market could allow these clients to trade stocks before most market 
participants learned about the new information in the survey.
The Value of Speed
ThE EFFICIENT-MARKET hYPOThESIS
As noted in Chapter 2, active stock markets, such as the NYSE Euronext and the 
Nasdaq market, are efficient in that they are made up of many rational investors 
who react quickly and objectively to new information. The efficient-market 
hypothesis (EMH), which is the basic theory describing the behavior of such a 
market, specifically states that
 1. Securities are typically in equilibrium, which means that they are fairly priced 
and that their expected returns equal their required returns.
 2. At any point in time, security prices fully reflect all information available about 
the firm and its securities, and these prices react swiftly to new information.
 3. Because stocks are fully and fairly priced, investors need not waste their time 
trying to find mispriced (undervalued or overvalued) securities.
Not all market participants are believers in the efficient-market hypothesis. 
Some believe that it is worthwhile to search for undervalued or overvalued

securities and to trade them to profit from market inefficiencies. Others argue 
that it is mere luck that would allow market participants to anticipate new infor￾mation correctly and as a result earn abnormal returns, that is, actual returns 
greater than should be expected given the risk of the investment. They believe 
that it is unlikely that market participants can over the long run earn abnormal 
returns. Contrary to this belief, some well-known investors such as Warren Buf￾fett and Bill Gross have over the long run consistently earned abnormal returns 
on their portfolios. It is unclear whether their success is the result of their supe￾rior ability to anticipate new information or of some form of market inefficiency.
The Behavioral Finance Challenge
Although considerable evidence supports the concept of market efficiency, a 
growing body of academic evidence has begun to cast doubt on the validity of 
this notion. The research documents various anomalies—outcomes that are in￾consistent with efficient markets—in stock returns. A number of academics and 
practitioners have also recognized that emotions and other subjective factors play 
a role in investment decisions.
This focus on investor behavior has resulted in a significant body of re￾search, collectively referred to as behavioral finance. Advocates of behavioral 
finance are commonly referred to as “behaviorists.” Daniel Kahneman was 
awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in economics for his work in behavioral finance, 
specifically for integrating insights from psychology and economics. Ongoing 
research into the psychological factors that can affect investor behavior and the 
resulting effects on stock prices will likely result in growing acceptance of be￾havioral finance. The Focus on Practice box further explains some of the find￾ings of behavioral finance.
Although challenges to the efficient market hypothesis, such as those pre￾sented by advocates of behavioral finance, are interesting and worthy of study, 
in this text we generally take the position that markets are efficient. We will use 
the terms expected return and required return interchangeably because they 
should be equal in an efficient market. In other words, we will operate under 
the assumption that a stock’s market price at any point in time is the best esti￾mate of its value. We’re now ready to look closely at the mechanics of common 
stock valuation.
BASIC COMMON STOCK VALuATION EQuATION
Like the value of a bond, which we discussed in Chapter 6, the value of a share of 
common stock is equal to the present value of all future cash flows (dividends) 
that it is expected to provide. Although a stockholder can earn capital gains by 
selling stock at a price above that originally paid, what the buyer really pays for 
is the right to all future dividends. What about stocks that do not currently pay 
dividends? Such stocks have a value attributable to a future dividend stream or to 
the proceeds from the sale of the company. Therefore, from a valuation view￾point, future dividends are relevant.
The basic valuation model for common stock is given by

where
P0 = value today of common stock
Dt = per@share dividend expected at the end of year t
rs = required return on common stock
The equation can be simplified somewhat by redefining each year’s dividend, Dt
, 
in terms of anticipated growth. We will consider three models here: zero growth, 
constant growth, and variable growth.
Zero-Growth Model
The simplest approach to dividend valuation, the zero-growth model, assumes a 
constant, nongrowing dividend stream. In terms of the notation already introduced,
D1 = D2= g= D∞
Market anomalies are 
patterns inconsistent 
with the efficient market hypothesis. Be￾havioral finance has a number of theo￾ries to help explain how human emo￾tions influence people in their investment 
decision-making processes.
Regret theory deals with the emo￾tional reaction people experience after 
realizing they have made an error in 
judgment. When deciding whether to 
sell a stock, investors become emotion￾ally affected by the price at which they 
purchased the stock. A sale at a loss 
would confirm that the investor miscalcu￾lated the value of the stock when it was 
purchased. The correct approach when 
considering whether to sell a stock is, 
“Would I buy this stock today if it were 
already liquidated?” If the answer is 
“no,” it is time to sell. Regret theory also 
holds true for investors who passed up 
buying a stock that now is selling at a 
much higher price. Again, the correct 
approach is to value the stock today 
without regard to its prior value.
Herding is another market behavior 
affecting investor decisions. Some 
investors rationalize their decision to buy 
certain stocks with “everyone else is do￾ing it.” Investors may feel less 
focus on PRACTICE
in practice
Understanding Human Behavior Helps Us Understand Investor Behavior
Other investor behaviors are pros￾pect theory and anchoring. According to 
prospect theory, people express a differ￾ent degree of emotion toward gains than 
losses. Individuals are stressed more by 
prospective losses than they are buoyed 
by the prospect of equal gains. Anchor￾ing is the tendency of investors to place 
more value on recent information. People 
tend to give too much credence to recent 
market opinions and events and mistak￾enly extrapolate recent trends that differ 
from historical, long-term averages and 
probabilities. Anchoring is a partial ex￾planation for the longevity of some bull 
markets.
Most stock-valuation techniques re￾quire that all relevant information be 
available to properly determine a stock’s 
value and potential for future gain. Be￾havioral finance may explain the connec￾tion between valuation and an investor’s 
actions based on that valuation.
▶ Theories of behavioral finance can 
apply to other areas of human be￾havior in addition to investing. Think 
of a situation in which you may have 
demonstrated one of these behav￾iors. Share your situation with a 
classmate.
embarrassment about losing money on a 
popular stock than about losing money 
on an unknown or unpopular stock.
People have a tendency to place 
particular events into mental accounts,
and the difference between these com￾partments sometimes influences behavior 
more than the events themselves. Re￾searchers have asked people the follow￾ing question: “Would you purchase a 
$20 ticket at the local theater if you real￾ize after you get there that you have lost 
a $20 bill?” Roughly 88 percent of peo￾ple would do so. Under another sce￾nario, people were asked whether they 
would buy a second $20 ticket if they 
arrived at the theater and realized that 
they had left at home a ticket purchased 
in advance for $20. Only 40 percent of 
respondents would buy another. In both 
scenarios, the person is out $40, but 
mental accounting leads to a different 
outcome. In investing, compartmentaliza￾tion is best illustrated by the hesitation to 
sell an investment that once had mon￾strous gains and now has a modest 
gain. During bull markets, people get ac￾customed to paper gains. When a mar￾ket correction deflates investors’ net 
worth, they are hesitant to sell, causing 
them to wait for the return of that gain.
zero-growth model
An approach to dividend 
valuation that assumes a 
constant, nongrowing dividend 
stream.ChAPTER 7   Stock Valuation 333
The equation shows that with zero growth, the value of a share of stock would 
equal the present value of a perpetuity of D1
 dollars discounted at a rate rs
. (Perpe￾tuities were introduced in Chapter 5; see Equation 5.14 and the related discussion.)
Chuck Swimmer estimates that the dividend of Denham Com￾pany, an established textile producer, is expected to remain con￾stant at $3 per share indefinitely. If his required return on its stock is 15%, the 
stock’s value is $20 ($3 , 0.15) per share.
Preferred Stock Valuation Because preferred stock typically provides its 
holders with a fixed annual dividend and because it never matures, Equation 7.2 
can be used to find the value of preferred stock. The value of preferred stock can 
be estimated by substituting the dividend on the preferred stock for D1
 and the 
required return for rs
 in Equation 7.2. For example, a preferred stock paying a $5 
annual dividend and having a required return of 13 percent would have a value 
of $38.46 ($5 , 0.13) per share.
Constant-Growth Model
The most widely cited dividend valuation approach, the constant-growth model, as￾sumes that dividends will grow at a constant rate, but a rate that is less than the re￾quired return. (The assumption that the constant rate of growth, g, is less than the 
required return, rs
, is a necessary mathematical condition for deriving this model.1
) 
By letting D0
 represent the most recent dividend, we can rewrite Equation 7.1 as

(7.2)
When we let D1
 represent the amount of the annual dividend, Equation 7.1 under 
zero growth reduces to
1. Another assumption of the constant-growth model as presented is that earnings and dividends grow at the same 
rate. This assumption is true only in cases in which a firm pays out a fixed percentage of its earnings each year (has 
a fixed payout ratio). In the case of a declining industry, a negative growth rate (g < 0%) might exist. In such a case, 
the constant-growth model, as well as the variable-growth model presented in the next section, remains fully appli￾cable to the valuation process.

Lamar Company, a small cosmetics company, from 2010 through 2015 paid the 
following per-share dividends:
Example 7.3 ▶
Year Dividend per share
2015 $1.40
2014 1.29
2013 1.20
2012 1.12
2011 1.05
2010 1.00
We assume that the historical annual growth rate of dividends is an accurate esti￾mate of the future constant annual rate of dividend growth, g. To find the his￾torical annual growth rate of dividends, we must solve the following for g:
D2015 = D2010 * (1 + g)
5
D2015
D2010
= (1 + g)
5
$1.40
$1.00 = (1 + g)

Using a financial calculator, we find that the historical annual growth rate of 
Lamar Company dividends equals approximately 7%. (Note: Most calculators 
require either the PV or FV value to be input as a negative number to calculate an 
unknown interest or growth rate. That approach is used here.) The company es￾timates that its dividend in 2016, D1
, will equal $1.50 (about 7% more than the 
last dividend). The required return, rs
, is 15%. By substituting these values into 
Equation 7.4, we find the value of the stock to be
P0 =
$1.50
0.15 - 0.07 =
$1.50
0.08 = $18.75 per share
Assuming that the values of D1
, rs
, and g are accurately estimated, Lamar Com￾pany’s stock value is $18.75 per share.
Variable-Growth Model
The zero- and constant-growth common stock models do not allow for any shift 
in expected growth rates. Because future growth rates might shift up or down 
because of changing business conditions, it is useful to consider a variable-growth 
model that allows for a change in the dividend growth rate.2
 We will assume that 
a single shift in growth rates occurs at the end of year N, and we will use g1
 to 
represent the initial growth rate and g2
 for the growth rate after the shift. To de￾termine the value of a share of stock in the case of variable growth, we use a four￾step procedure:
2. More than one change in the growth rate can be incorporated into the model, but to simplify the discussion we 
will consider only a single growth-rate change. The number of variable-growth valuation models is technically un￾limited, but concern over all possible shifts in growth is unlikely to yield much more accuracy than a simpler model.

The following example illustrates the application of these steps to a variable￾growth situation with only one change in growth rate.
Victoria Robb is considering purchasing the common stock of 
Warren Industries, a rapidly growing boat manufacturer. She 
finds that the firm’s most recent (2015) annual dividend payment was $1.50 per 
share. Victoria estimates that these dividends will increase at a 10% annual rate, 
g1
, over the next 3 years (2016, 2017, and 2018) because of the introduction of a 
hot new boat. At the end of the 3 years (the end of 2018), she expects the firm’s 
mature product line to result in a slowing of the dividend growth rate to 5% per 
year, g2
, for the foreseeable future. Victoria’s required return, rs
, is 15%. To esti￾mate the current (end-of-2015) value of Warren’s common stock, P0 = P2015, she 
applies the four-step procedure to these data.
IRF Personal Finance Example 7.4 ▶336 PART 3   Valuation of Securities
Step 1 The value of the cash dividends in each of the next 3 years is calculated 
in columns 1, 2, and 3 of Table 7.3. The 2016, 2017, and 2018 divi￾dends are $1.65, $1.82, and $2.00, respectively.
Step 2 The present value of the three dividends expected during the 2016–2018 
initial growth period is calculated in columns 3, 4, and 5 of Table 7.3. 
The sum of the present values of the three dividends is $4.12.
Step 3 The value of the stock at the end of the initial growth period (N = 2018)
can be found by first calculating DN+1 = D2019:
D2019 = D2018 * (1 + 0.05) = $2.00 * (1.05) = $2.10
By using D2019 = $2.10, a 15% required return, and a 5% dividend 
growth rate, the value of the stock at the end of 2018 is calculated as
P2018 =
D2019

Finally, in Step 3, the share value of $21 at the end of 2018 must be con￾verted into a present (end-of-2015) value. Using the 15% required re￾turn, we get
P2018

Step 4 Adding the present value of the initial dividend stream (found in Step 2) 
to the present value of the stock at the end of the initial growth period 
(found in Step 3) as specified in Equation 7.5, the current (end-of-2015) 
value of Warren Industries stock is
P2015 = $4.12 + $13.81 = $17.93 per share
Victoria’s calculations indicate that the stock is currently worth

history or are startups or when one is valuing an operating unit or division of a 
larger public company. Although dividend valuation models are widely used and 
accepted, in these situations it is preferable to use a more general free cash flow 
valuation model.
The free cash flow valuation model is based on the same basic premise as 
dividend valuation models: The value of a share of common stock is the present 
value of all future cash flows it is expected to provide over an infinite time hori￾zon. However, in the free cash flow valuation model, instead of valuing the firm’s 
expected dividends, we value the firm’s expected free cash flows, defined in 
Chapter 4 (on page 171, equation 4.4). They represent the amount of cash flow 
available to investors—the providers of debt (creditors) and equity (owners)—af￾ter all other obligations have been met.
The free cash flow valuation model estimates the value of the entire com￾pany by finding the present value of its expected free cash flows discounted at 
its weighted average cost of capital, which is its expected average future cost 
of funds (we’ll say more about this in Chapter 9), as specified in Equation 7.6:

value of an entire company as

Note the similarity between Equations 7.6 and 7.1, the general stock valuation 
equation.
Because the value of the entire company, VC, is the market value of the entire 
enterprise (that is, of all assets), to find common stock value, VS
, we must sub￾tract the market value of all the firm’s debt, VD, and the market value of pre￾ferred stock, VP, from VC:
Because it is difficult to forecast a firm’s free cash flow, specific annual cash 
flows are typically forecast for only about 5 years, beyond which a constant 
growth rate is assumed. Here we assume that the first 5 years of free cash flows 
are explicitly forecast and that a constant rate of free cash flow growth occurs 
beyond the end of year 5 to infinity. This model is methodologically similar to the 
variable-growth model presented earlier in this chapter. Its application is best 
demonstrated with an example.
Dewhurst, Inc., wishes to determine the value of its stock by using the free cash 
flow valuation model. To apply the model, the firm’s CFO developed the data 
given in Table 7.4. Application of the model can be performed in four steps.
IRF Example 7.5 ▶338 PART 3   Valuation of Securities
Step 1 Calculate the present value of the free cash flow occurring from the end of 
2021 to infinity, measured at the beginning of 2021 (that is, at the end of 
2020). Because a constant rate of growth in FCF is forecast beyond 2020, 
we can use the constant-growth dividend valuation model (Equation 7.4) to 
calculate the value of the free cash flows from the end of 2021 to infinity:
 Value of FCF2021S ∞ =

$600,000 * (1 + 0.03)
0.09 - 0.03

0.06 = $10,300,000
Note that to calculate the FCF in 2021, we had to increase the 2020 FCF 
value of $600,000 by the 3% FCF growth rate, gFCF.
Step 2 Add the present value of the FCF from 2021 to infinity, which is measured 
at the end of 2020, to the 2020 FCF value to get the total FCF in 2020:
Total FCF2020 = $600,000 + $10,300,000 = $10,900,000
Step 3 Find the sum of the present values of the FCFs for 2016 through 2020 to 
determine the value of the entire company, VC. This calculation is shown 
in Table 7.5.

Step 3, and the market values of debt, VD, and preferred stock, VP, given

The value of Dewhurst’s common stock is therefore estimated to be $4,726,426. By 
dividing this total by the 300,000 shares of common stock that the firm has outstand￾ing, we get a common stock value of $15.75 per share ($4,726,426 , 300,000).
It should now be clear that the free cash flow valuation model is consistent 
with the dividend valuation models presented earlier. The appeal of this approach 
is its focus on the free cash flow estimates rather than on forecasted dividends, 
which are far more difficult to estimate given that they are paid at the discretion of 
the firm’s board. The more general nature of the free cash flow model is responsible 
for its growing popularity, particularly with CFOs and other financial managers.
OThER APPROAChES TO COMMON STOCK VALuATION
Many other approaches to common stock valuation exist. The more popular ap￾proaches include book value, liquidation value, and some type of price/earnings 
multiple.
Book Value
Book value per share is simply the amount per share of common stock that would 
be received if all the firm’s assets were sold for their exact book (accounting) value
and the proceeds remaining after paying all liabilities (including preferred stock) 
were divided among the common stockholders. This method lacks sophistication 
and can be criticized on the basis of its reliance on historical balance sheet data. It 
ignores the firm’s expected earnings potential and generally lacks any true relation￾ship to the firm’s value in the marketplace. Let us look at an example.
At year-end 2015, Lamar Company’s balance sheet shows total assets of $6 mil￾lion, total liabilities and preferred stock of $4.5 million, and 100,000 shares of 
common stock outstanding. Its book value per share would therefore be
$6,000,000 - $4,500,000
100,000 shares = $15 per share
Because this value assumes that assets could be sold for their book value, it may 
not represent the minimum price at which shares are valued in the marketplace. 
As a matter of fact, although most stocks sell above book value, it is not unusual 
to find stocks selling below book value when investors believe either that assets 
are overvalued or that the firm’s liabilities are understated.
Liquidation Value
Liquidation value per share is the actual amount per share of common stock that 
would be received if all the firm’s assets were sold for their market value, liabilities 
and preferred stock were paid, and any remaining money were divided among the 
Example 7.6 ▶

common stockholders. This measure is more realistic than book value—because it 
is based on the current market value of the firm’s assets—but it still fails to consider 
the earning power of those assets. An example will illustrate.
Lamar Company found on investigation that it could obtain only $5.25 million if 
it sold its assets today. The firm’s liquidation value per share would therefore be
$5,250,000 - $4,500,000
100,000 shares = $7.50 per share
Ignoring liquidation expenses, this amount would be the firm’s minimum value.
Price/Earnings (P/E) Multiples
The price/earnings (P/E) ratio, introduced in Chapter 3, reflects the amount in￾vestors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. The average P/E ratio in a 
particular industry can be used as a guide to a firm’s value, if it is assumed that 
investors value the earnings of that firm in the same way they do the “average” 
firm in the industry. The price/earnings multiple approach is a popular technique 
used to estimate the firm’s share value; it is calculated by multiplying the firm’s 
expected earnings per share (EPS) by the average price/earnings (P/E) ratio for the

A popular technique used to

Corporate managers 
have long complained 
about the pressure to focus on the short 
term, and now business groups are 
coming to their defense. “The focus on the 
short term is a huge problem,” says 
William Donaldson, former chairman of 
the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
“With all of the attention paid to quarterly 
performance, managers are taking their 
eyes off long-term strategic goals.”
Donaldson, the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, and others believe that the 
best way to focus companies toward 
long-term goals is to do away with the 
practice of giving quarterly earnings 
guidance. In March 2007, the CFA 
Centre for Financial Market Integrity 
and the Business Roundtable Institute for 
Corporate Ethics proposed a template 
for quarterly earnings reports that 
would, in their view, obviate the need 
for earnings guidance.
Meanwhile, many companies are 
hesitant to give up issuing quarterly 
guidance. The practice of issuing earnings 
forecasts began in the early 1980s, a 
few years after the SEC’s decision to 
allow companies to include forward￾looking projections, provided that they 
were accompanied by appropriate 
cautionary language. The result was what 
former SEC chairman Arthur Levitt once 
called a “game of winks and nods.” 
Companies used earnings guidance to 
lower analysts’ estimates; when the actual 
numbers came in higher, their stock prices 
jumped. The practice reached a fever 
pitch during the late 1990s when 
companies that missed the consensus 
earnings estimate, even by just a penny, 
saw their stock prices tumble.
One of the first companies to stop 
issuing earnings guidance was Gillette, 
in 2001. Others that abandoned quar￾terly guidance were Coca-Cola, Intel, 
and McDonald’s. It became a trend. By 
2005, just 61 percent of companies 
were offering quarterly projections to 
the public; according to the National 
Investor Relations Institute, the number 
declined to 52 percent in 2006.
Not everyone agrees with eliminating 
quarterly guidance. A survey conducted 
by New York University’s Stern School 
of Business finance professor Baruch Lev, 
along with University of Florida professors 
Joel Houston and Jennifer Tucker, showed 
that companies that ended quarterly 
guidance reaped almost no benefit from 
doing so. Their study found no evidence 
that guidance stoppers increased capital 
investments or research and development. 
So when should companies give up 
earnings guidance? According to Lev, 
they should do so only when they are 
not very good at predicting their earnings. 
“If you are not better than others at 
forecasting, then don’t bother,” he says.

industry. The average P/E ratio for the industry can be obtained from a source 
such as Standard & Poor’s Industrial Ratios.
The P/E ratio valuation technique is a simple method of determining a stock’s 
value and can be quickly calculated after firms make earnings announcements, 
which accounts for its popularity. Naturally, this use has increased the demand 
for more frequent announcements or “guidance” regarding future earnings. Some 
firms believe that pre-earnings guidance creates additional costs and can lead to 
ethical issues, as discussed in the Focus on Ethics box on the previous page.
The use of P/E multiples is especially helpful in valuing firms that are not 
publicly traded, but analysts use this approach for public companies too. In any 
case, the price/earnings multiple approach is considered superior to the use of 
book or liquidation values because it considers expected earnings. An example 
will demonstrate the use of price/earnings multiples.
Ann Perrier plans to use the price/earnings multiple approach 
to estimate the value of Lamar Company’s stock, which she 
currently holds in her retirement account. She estimates that Lamar Company 
will earn $2.60 per share next year (2016). This expectation is based on an analy￾sis of the firm’s historical earnings trend and of expected economic and industry 
conditions. She finds the price/earnings (P/E) ratio for firms in the same industry 
to average 7. Multiplying Lamar’s expected earnings per share (EPS) of $2.60 by 
this ratio gives her a value for the firm’s shares of $18.20, assuming that investors 
will continue to value the average firm at 7 times its earnings.
So how much is Lamar Company’s stock really worth? That’s a trick ques￾tion because there’s no one right answer. It is important to recognize that the 
answer depends on the assumptions made and the techniques used. Professional 
securities analysts typically use a variety of models and techniques to value stocks. 
For example, an analyst might use the constant-growth model, liquidation value, 
and a price/earnings (P/E) multiple to estimate the worth of a given stock. If the 
analyst feels comfortable with his or her estimates, the stock would be valued at 
no more than the largest estimate. Of course, should the firm’s estimated liquida￾tion value per share exceed its “going concern” value per share, estimated by us￾ing one of the valuation models (zero-, constant-, or variable-growth or free cash 
flow) or the P/E multiple approach, the firm would be viewed as being “worth 
more dead than alive.” In such an event, the firm would lack sufficient earning 
power to justify its existence and should probably be liquidated.
Personal Finance Example 7.8 ▶
Matter of fact
T
he P/E multiple approach is a fast and easy way to estimate a stock’s value. However, P/E 
ratios vary widely over time. In 1980, the average stock had a P/E ratio below 9, but by the 
year 2000, the ratio had risen above 40. Therefore, analysts using the P/E approach in the 1980s 
would have come up with much lower estimates of value than analysts using the model 20 years 
later. By 2012, the average stock had a P/E ratio of about 20, which is close to the long-run 
average. When using this approach to estimate stock values, the estimate will depend more on 
whether stock market valuations generally are high or low rather than on whether the particular 
company is doing well or not.

7.4 decision Making and Common Stock Value
Valuation equations measure the stock value at a point in time based on expected 
return and risk. Any decisions of the financial manager that affect these variables 
can cause the value of the firm to change. Figure 7.3 depicts the relationship 
among financial decisions, return, risk, and stock value.
ChANGES IN ExPECTEd dIVIdENdS
Assuming that economic conditions remain stable, any management action 
that would cause current and prospective stockholders to raise their dividend 
expectations should increase the firm’s value. In Equation 7.4, we can see that 
P0
 will increase for any increase in D1
 or g. Any action of the financial man￾ager that will increase the level of expected dividends without changing risk 
(the required return) should be undertaken because it will positively affect 
owners’ wealth.

Using the constant-growth model given earlier in Example 7.3, we found Lamar 
Company to have a share value of $18.75. On the following day, the firm an￾nounced a major technological breakthrough that would revolutionize its industry. 
Current and prospective stockholders would not be expected to adjust their required 
return of 15%, but they would expect that future dividends will increase. Specifi￾cally, they expect that although the dividend next year, D1
, will remain at $1.50, the 
expected rate of growth thereafter will increase from 7% to 9%. If we substitute 
D1 = $1.50, rs = 0.15, and g = 0.09 into Equation 7.4, the resulting share value 
is $25 3$1.50 , (0.15 - 0.09) 4 . The increased value therefore resulted from the 
higher expected future dividends reflected in the increase in the growth rate.
ChANGES IN RISK
Although the required return, rs
, is the focus of Chapters 8 and 9, at this point we 
can consider its fundamental components. Any measure of required return con￾sists of two components, a risk-free rate and a risk premium. We expressed this 
relationship as Equation 6.1 in Chapter 6, which we repeat here in terms of rs
:
rs = r* + IP + RPs ¯˚˘˚˙
risk-free 
rate, RF
¯˘˙
risk 
premium
In Chapter 8, you will learn that the real challenge in finding the required return 
is determining the appropriate risk premium. In Chapters 8 and 9, we will discuss 
how investors and managers can estimate the risk premium for any particular as￾set. For now, recognize that rs
 represents the minimum return that the firm’s 
stock must provide to shareholders to compensate them for bearing the risk of 
holding the firm’s equity.
Any action taken by the financial manager that increases the risk sharehold￾ers must bear will also increase the risk premium required by shareholders and 
hence the required return. Additionally, the required return can be affected by 
changes in the risk free rate, even if the risk premium remains constant. For ex￾ample, if the risk-free rate increases due to a shift in government policy, the re￾quired return goes up, too. In Equation 7.1, we can see that an increase in the 
required return, rs
, will reduce share value, P0
, and that a decrease in the required 
return will increase share value. Thus, any action of the financial manager that 
increases risk contributes to a reduction in value, and any action that decreases 
risk contributes to an increase in value.
Assume that Lamar Company’s 15% required return resulted from a risk-free 
rate of 9% and a risk premium of 6%. With this return, the firm’s share value 
was calculated in Example 7.3 to be $18.75.
Now imagine that the financial manager makes a decision that, without chang￾ing expected dividends, causes the firm’s risk premium to increase to 7%. Assuming 
that the risk-free rate remains at 9%, the new required return on Lamar stock will be 
16% (9% + 7%), and substituting D1 = $1.50, rs = 0.16, and g = 0.07 into the 
valuation equation (Equation 7.3) results in a new share value of 
$16.67 3$1.50 , (0.16 - 0.07) 4. As expected, raising the required return, with￾out any corresponding increase in expected dividends, causes the firm’s stock value to 
decline. Clearly, the financial manager’s action was not in the owners’ best interest.
Example 7.9 ▶
Example 7.10 ▶344 PART 3   Valuation of Securities
COMBINEd EFFECT
A financial decision rarely affects dividends and risk independently; most deci￾sions affect both factors often in the same direction. As firms take on more risk, 
their shareholders expect to see higher dividends. The net effect on value depends 
on the relative size of the changes in these two variables.
If we assume that the two changes illustrated for Lamar Company in the preceding 
examples occur simultaneously, the key variable values would be 
D1 = $1.50, rs = 0.16, and g = 0.09. Substituting into the valuation model, we 
obtain a share price of $21.43 3$1.50 , (0.16 - 0.09) 4 . The net result of the 
decision, which increased dividend growth (g, from 7% to 9%) as well as required 
return (rs
, from 15% to 16%), is positive. The share price increased from $18.75 to 
$21.43. Even with the combined effects, the decision appears to be in the best inter￾est of the firm’s owners because it increases their wealth.

Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
The price of each share of a firm’s common stock is the value of each ownership 
interest. Although common stockholders typically have voting rights, which in￾directly give them a say in management, their most significant right is their 
claim on the residual cash flows of the firm. This claim is subordinate to those 
of vendors, employees, customers, lenders, the government (for taxes), and pre￾ferred stockholders. The value of the common stockholders’ claim is embodied 
in the future cash flows they are entitled to receive. The present value of those 
expected cash flows is the firm’s share value.
To determine this present value, forecast cash flows are discounted at a rate 
that reflects their risk. Riskier cash flows are discounted at higher rates, resulting 
in lower present values than less risky expected cash flows, which are discounted 
at lower rates. The value of the firm’s common stock is therefore driven by its ex￾pected cash flows (returns) and risk (certainty of the expected cash flows).
In pursuing the firm’s goal of maximizing the stock price, the financial man￾ager must carefully consider the balance of return and risk associated with each 
proposal and must undertake only those actions that create value for owners. By 
focusing on value creation and by managing and monitoring the firm’s cash flows 
and risk, the financial manager should be able to achieve the firm’s goal of share 
price maximization.ChAPTER 7   Stock Valuation 345
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
LG 1 Differentiate between debt and equity. Holders of equity capital (com￾mon and preferred stock) are owners of the firm. Typically, only common stock￾holders have a voice in management. Equityholders’ claims on income and assets 
are secondary to creditors’ claims, there is no maturity date, and dividends paid 
to stockholders are not tax deductible.
LG 2 Discuss the features of both common and preferred stock. The common 
stock of a firm can be privately owned, closely owned, or publicly owned. It 
can be sold with or without a par value. Preemptive rights allow common 
stockholders to avoid dilution of ownership when new shares are issued. Not 
all shares authorized in the corporate charter are outstanding. If a firm has 
treasury stock, it will have issued more shares than are outstanding. Some 
firms have two or more classes of common stock that differ mainly in having 
unequal voting rights. Proxies transfer voting rights from one party to 
another. The decision to pay dividends to common stockholders is made by 
the firm’s board of directors. Firms can issue stock in foreign markets. The 
stock of many foreign corporations is traded in U.S. markets in the form of 
American depositary receipts (ADRs), which are backed by American 
depositary shares (ADSs).
Preferred stockholders have preference over common stockholders with 
respect to the distribution of earnings and assets. They do not normally have 
voting privileges. Preferred stock issues may have certain restrictive covenants, 
cumulative dividends, a call feature, and a conversion feature.
LG 3 Describe the process of issuing common stock, including venture capital, 
going public, and the investment banker. The initial nonfounder financing for 
business startups with attractive growth prospects typically comes from private 
equity investors. These investors can be either angel capitalists or venture 
capitalists (VCs). VCs usually invest in both early-stage and later-stage 
companies that they hope to take public so as to cash out their investments.
The first public issue of a firm’s stock is called an initial public offering 
(IPO). The company selects an investment banker to advise it and to sell the 
securities. The lead investment banker may form a selling syndicate with other 
investment bankers. The IPO process includes getting SEC approval, promoting 
the offering to investors, and pricing the issue.
LG 4 Understand the concept of market efficiency and basic stock valuation using 
zero-growth, constant-growth, and variable-growth models. Market efficiency 
assumes that the quick reactions of rational investors to new information cause the 
market value of common stock to adjust upward or downward quickly. The 
efficient-market hypothesis (EMH) suggests that securities are fairly priced, that 
they reflect fully all publicly available information, and that investors should 
therefore not waste time trying to find and capitalize on mispriced securities. 
Behavioral finance advocates challenge this hypothesis by arguing that emotion 
and other factors play a role in investment decisions.
The value of a share of stock is the present value of all future dividends it is 
expected to provide over an infinite time horizon. Three dividend growth 346 PART 3   Valuation of Securities
models—zero-growth, constant-growth, and variable-growth—can be considered 
in common stock valuation. The most widely cited model is the constant-growth 
model.
LG 5 Discuss the free cash flow valuation model and the book value, liquidation 
value, and price/earnings (P/E) multiple approaches. The free cash flow valuation 
model values firms that have no dividend history, startups, or an operating unit 
or division of a larger public company. The model finds the value of the entire 
company by discounting the firm’s expected free cash flow at its weighted 
average cost of capital. The common stock value is found by subtracting the 
market values of the firm’s debt and preferred stock from the value of the entire 
company.
Book value per share is the amount per share of common stock that would 
be received if all the firm’s assets were sold for their exact book (accounting) 
value and the proceeds remaining after paying all liabilities (including preferred 
stock) were divided among the common stockholders. Liquidation value per 
share is the actual amount per share of common stock that would be received 
if all the firm’s assets were sold for their market value, liabilities (including 
preferred stock) were paid, and the remaining money were divided among the 
common stockholders. The price/earnings (P/E) multiple approach estimates 
stock value by multiplying the firm’s expected earnings per share (EPS) by the 
average price/earnings (P/E) ratio for the industry.
LG 6 Explain the relationships among financial decisions, return, risk, and the 
firm’s value. In a stable economy, any action of the financial manager that 
increases the level of expected dividends without changing risk should increase 
share value; any action that reduces the level of expected dividends without 
changing risk should reduce share value. Similarly, any action that increases risk 
(required return) will reduce share value; any action that reduces risk will 
increase share value. An assessment of the combined effect of return and risk on 
stock value must be part of the financial decision-making process.

n the world of trendsetting fashion, instinct and marketing savvy are prerequisites 
to success. Jordan Ellis had both. During 2015, his international casual-wear 
company, Encore, rocketed to $300 million in sales after 10 years in business. His 
fashion line covered the young woman from head to toe with hats, sweaters, 
dresses, blouses, skirts, pants, sweatshirts, socks, and shoes. In Manhattan, there 
was an Encore shop every five or six blocks, each featuring a different color. Some 
shops showed the entire line in mauve, and others featured it in canary yellow.
Encore had made it. The company’s historical growth was so spectacular 
that no one could have predicted it. However, securities analysts speculated that 
Encore could not keep up the pace. They warned that competition is fierce in the 
fashion industry and that the firm might encounter little or no growth in the 
future. They estimated that stockholders also should expect no growth in future 
dividends.
Contrary to the conservative securities analysts, Jordan Ellis believed that the 
company could maintain a constant annual growth rate in dividends per share of 
6% in the future, or possibly 8% for the next 2 years and 6% thereafter. Ellis 
based his estimates on an established long-term expansion plan into European and 
Latin American markets. Venturing into these markets was expected to cause the 
risk of the firm, as measured by the risk premium on its stock, to increase 
immediately from 8.8% to 10%. Currently, the risk-free rate is 6%.
In preparing the long-term financial plan, Encore’s chief financial officer has as￾signed a junior financial analyst, Marc Scott, to evaluate the firm’s current stock 
price. He has asked Marc to consider the conservative predictions of the securities 
analysts and the aggressive predictions of the company founder, Jordan Ellis.
Marc has compiled the following 2015 financial data to aid his analysis.

Most people intuitively understand the principle that risk and return are linked. 
After all, as the old saying goes, “Nothing ventured, nothing gained.” In 
the next two chapters, we’ll explore how investors and financial managers quan￾tify the notion of risk and how they determine how much additional return is ap￾propriate compensation for taking extra risk.
Chapter 8 lays the groundwork, defining the terms risk and return and explaining 
why investors think about risk in different ways depending on whether they want 
to understand the risk of a specific investment or the risk of a broad portfolio of 
investments. Perhaps the most famous and widely applied theory in all finance, 
the Capital Asset Pricing Model (or CAPM), is introduced here. The CAPM tells 
investors and managers alike what return they should expect given the risk of the 
asset they want to invest in.
Chapter 9 applies these lessons in a managerial finance setting. Firms raise 
money from two broad sources, owners and lenders. Owners provide equity 
financing and lenders provide debt. To maximize the value of the firm, managers 
have to satisfy both groups, and doing so means earning returns high enough to 
meet investors’ expectations. The focus in Chapter 9 is on the cost of capital or, 
more precisely, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC tells 
managers exactly what kind of return their investments in plant and equipment, 
advertising, and human resources have to earn if the firm is to satisfy its investors. 
Essentially, the WACC is a hurdle rate, the minimum acceptable return that a firm 
should earn on any investment it makes.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
Accounting You need to understand the relationship between risk and return 
because of the effect that riskier projects will have on the firm’s financial 
statements.
informAtion SYStemS You need to understand how to do scenario and 
correlation analyses to build decision packages that help management analyze 
the risk and return of various business opportunities.
mAnAgement You need to understand the relationship between risk and return 
and how to measure that relationship to evaluate data that come from finance 
personnel and translate those data into decisions that increase the value of the 
firm.
operAtionS You need to understand why investments in plant, equipment, and 
systems need to be evaluated in light of their impact on the firm’s risk and return, 
which together will affect the firm’s value.
In your personal life the trade-off between risk and return enters 
into numerous personal financial decisions. 
You will use risk and return concepts when you invest your savings, buy real 
estate, finance major purchases, purchase insurance, invest in securities, and 
implement retirement plans. Although risk and return are difficult to measure 
precisely, you can get a feel for them and make decisions based on the trade-offs 
between risk and return in light of your personal disposition toward risk.Miller’s Time
F
or more than a decade, Bill Miller stood at the top 
of the investment world. The mutual fund that he 
managed, the Legg Mason Value Trust, had outper￾formed the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Composite In￾dex for 15 consecutive years, a record still unmatched 
by any other portfolio manager. From 1991 to 2005, 
the S&P 500 earned an average return of 12.7 percent, 
while Miller’s fund averaged 16.4 percent. That performance attracted lots of new investors, and 
Miller’s fund grew to more than $20 billion under management.
Whether that string was due to skill or luck, it ended in 2006. Miller trailed the index in 4 of 
the next 5 years, sometimes by a wide margin. During that period, Miller ranked in the bottom 1% of 
all stock fund managers, and investors left in droves. By the time Miller handed over management of 
the Value Trust to his successor in April 2012, assets under management had fallen to $2.8 billion.
Just 1 year later, however, Miller was on top again. In the 12 months ended on March 31, 
2013, the Legg Mason Opportunity fund that Miller comanaged with Samantha McLemore was the 
top-performing fund in its category. One reason was that Miller and McLemore placed a large bet 
on a recovery in financial stocks, the same kind of bet that cost Miller dearly during the financial cri￾sis. More than 34% of the Opportunity fund’s assets were invested in financial stocks such as Bank 
of America, and this time the bet paid off. Only time will tell whether it will mark the beginning of 
another long string of success for Miller, but there are some important lessons to be learned from his 
investment track record. First, with an investment that offers very high returns (whether that investment 
is a fund or a stock or anything else), there is usually high risk lurking somewhere. Second, the risk of 
an undiversified (or poorly diversified) portfolio is higher than that of a well-diversified portfolio. 
Third, it is extremely difficult to earn abnormal (that is, above average) returns for an extended pe￾riod, even if you are a professional investor.

 8.1 Risk and Return Fundamentals
In most important business decisions there are two key financial considerations: 
risk and return. Each financial decision presents certain risk and return characteris￾tics, and the combination of these characteristics can increase or decrease a firm’s 
share price. Analysts use different methods to quantify risk, depending on whether 
they are looking at a single asset or a portfolio— a collection or group of assets. We 
will look at both, beginning with the risk of a single asset. First, though, it is impor￾tant to introduce some fundamental ideas about risk, return, and risk preferences.
RISK dEFINEd
In the most basic sense, risk is a measure of the uncertainty surrounding the re￾turn that an investment will earn. Investments whose returns are more uncertain 
are generally riskier. More formally, the term risk is used interchangeably with 
uncertainty to refer to the variability of returns associated with a given asset. A 
$1,000 government bond that guarantees its holder $5 interest after 30 days has 
no risk because there is no variability associated with the return. A $1,000 invest￾ment in a firm’s common stock is very risky because the value of that stock may 
move up or down substantially over the same 30 days.

For many years, inves￾tors around the world 
clamored to invest with Bernard 
Madoff. Those fortunate enough to 
invest with “Bernie” might not have 
understood his secret trading system, 
but they were happy with the double￾digit returns that they earned. Madoff 
was well connected, having been the 
chairman of the board of directors of 
the NASDAQ Stock Market and a 
founding member of the International 
Securities Clearing Corporation. His 
credentials seemed to be impeccable.
However, as the old saying goes, if 
something sounds too good to be true, it 
probably is. Madoff’s investors learned 
this lesson the hard way when, on 
December 11, 2008, the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
charged Madoff with securities fraud. 
Madoff’s hedge fund, Ascot Partners, 
turned out to be a giant Ponzi scheme.
Over the years, suspicions were 
raised about Madoff. He generated high 
returns year after year, seemingly with 
very little risk. Madoff credited his com￾plex trading strategy for his investment 
performance, but other investors 
employed similar strategies with much 
different results than Madoff reported. 
Harry Markopolos went as far as to sub￾mit a report to the SEC 3 years prior to 
Madoff’s arrest, titled “The World’s Larg￾est Hedge Fund Is a Fraud,” that 
detailed his concerns.
On June 29, 2009, after a lengthy 
trial and eventual conviction, Madoff 
was sentenced to 150 years in prison. 
Madoff’s investors are still working to 
recover what they can. Fraudulent 
account statements sent just prior to 
Madoff’s arrest indicated that investors’ 
accounts contained more than $64 bil￾lion, in aggregate. Many investors pur￾sued claims based on the balance 
reported in these statements. However, a 
court ruling only permits claims up to the 
difference between the amount an inves￾tor deposited with Madoff and the 
amount the investor withdrew. The judge 
also ruled that investors who managed to 
withdraw at least their initial investment 
before the fraud was uncovered are not 
eligible to recover additional funds.
Total out-of-pocket cash losses 
as a result of Madoff’s fraud were 
estimated to be $17.5 billion. In early 
2013, the Securities Investor Protec￾tion Corporation reported that more 
than 53 percent of the funds had 
either been returned or were in the 
process of being returned to Madoff’s 
defrauded customers.

RETuRN dEFINEd
Obviously, if we are going to assess risk on the basis of variability of return, we 
need to be certain we know what return is and how to measure it. The total rate 
of return is the total gain or loss experienced on an investment over a given 
period. Mathematically, an investment’s total return is the sum of any cash dis￾tributions (for example, dividends or interest payments) plus the change in the 
investment’s value, divided by the beginning-of-period value. The expression 
for calculating the total rate of return earned on any asset over period t, rt
, is 
commonly defined as
total rate of return
The total gain or loss 
experienced on an investment 
over a given period of time; 
calculated by dividing the 
asset’s cash distributions during 
the period, plus change in 
value, by its beginning-of￾period investment value.
1. This expression does not imply that an investor necessarily buys the asset at time t - 1 and sells it at time t. 
Rather, it represents the increase (or decrease) in wealth that the investor has experienced during the period by hold￾ing a particular investment. If the investor sells the asset at time t, we say that the investor has realized the return on 
the investment. If the investor continues to hold the investment, we say that the return is unrealized.
rt =
Ct + Pt - Pt-1

(8.1)
where
rt 5 actual, expected, or required rate of return during period t
Ct 5 cash (flow) received from the asset investment in the time period
t 2 1 to t
Pt 5 price (value) of asset at time t
Pt 2 1 5 price (value) of asset at time t 2 1
The return, rt
, reflects the combined effect of cash flow, Ct
, and changes in value, 
Pt - Pt-1
, over the period.1
Equation 8.1 is used to determine the rate of return over a time period as 
short as 1 day or as long as 10 years or more. However, in most cases, t is 1 year, 
and r therefore represents an annual rate of return.
Robin wishes to determine the return on two stocks that she owned during 2012, 
Apple Inc., and Wal-Mart. At the beginning of the year, Apple stock traded for 
$411.23 per share, and Wal-Mart was valued at $60.33. During the year, Apple 
paid $5.30 in dividends, and Wal-Mart shareholders received dividends of $1.59 
per share. At the end of the year, Apple stock was worth $532.17, and Wal-Mart 
sold for $68.23. Substituting into Equation 8.1, we can calculate the annual rate 
of return, r, for each stock:
Apple: ($5.30 + $532.17 - $411.23) , $411.23 = 30.7,
Wal@Mart: ($1.59 + $68.23 - $60.33) , $60.33 = 15.7,
Robin made money on both stocks in 2012, and her return was higher on Apple 
both in dollars and on a percentage basis.
Investment returns vary both over time and between different types of invest￾ments. By averaging historical returns over a long period of time, we can focus on 
the differences in returns that different kinds of investments tend to generate.

Table 8.1 shows both the nominal and real average annual rates of return from 
1900 to 2011 for three different types of investments: Treasury bills, Treasury 
bonds, and common stocks. Although bills and bonds are both issued by the U.S. 
government and are therefore viewed as relatively safe investments, bills have 
maturities of 1 year or less, whereas bonds have maturities ranging up to 
30 years. Consequently, the interest rate risk associated with Treasury bonds is 
much higher than with bills. Over the last 112 years, bills earned the lowest re￾turns, just 3.9 percent per year on average in nominal returns and only 0.9 per￾cent annually in real terms. The latter number means that average Treasury bill 
returns barely exceeded the average rate of inflation. Bond returns were higher, 
5.0 percent in nominal terms and 2.0 percent in real terms. Clearly, though, 
stocks outshined the other types of investments, earning average annual nominal 
returns of 9.3 percent and average real returns of 6.2 percent.
In light of these statistics, you might wonder, “Why would anyone invest in 
bonds or bills if the returns on stocks are so much higher?” The answer, as you 
will soon see, is that stocks are much riskier than either bonds or bills and that 
risk leads some investors to prefer the safer, albeit lower, returns on Treasury 
securities.
RISK PREFERENCES
Different people react to risk in different ways. Economists use three categories 
to describe how investors respond to risk. The first category, and the one that 
describes the behavior of most people most of the time, is called risk aversion. 
An investor who is risk averse prefers less risky over more risky investments, 
holding the rate of return fixed. A risk-averse investor who believes that two 
different investments have the same expected return will choose the investment 
whose returns are more certain. Stated another way, when choosing between 
two investments, a risk-averse investor will not make the riskier investment un￾less it offers a higher expected return to compensate the investor for bearing the 
additional risk.
A second attitude toward risk is called risk neutrality. An investor who is 
risk neutral chooses investments based solely on their expected returns, disre￾garding the risks. When choosing between two investments, a risk-neutral in￾vestor will always choose the investment with the higher expected return re￾gardless of its risk.
Finally, an investor who is risk seeking prefers investments with higher risk 
and may even sacrifice some expected return when choosing a riskier investment.

endeavors, which implies that the expected return on these activities is negative, 
and individuals lose on average. People nonetheless buy lottery tickets and visit

8.2 Risk of a Single Asset
In this section, we refine our understanding of risk. Surprisingly, the concept of 
risk changes when the focus shifts from the risk of a single asset held in isolation 
to the risk of a portfolio of assets. Here, we examine different statistical methods 
to quantify risk; later, we apply those methods to portfolios.
RISK ASSESSMENT
The notion that risk is somehow connected to uncertainty is intuitive. The more 
uncertain you are about how an investment will perform, the riskier that invest￾ment seems. Scenario analysis provides a simple way to quantify that intuition, 
and probability distributions offer an even more sophisticated way to analyze the 
risk of an investment.
Scenario Analysis
Scenario analysis uses several possible alternative outcomes (scenarios) to obtain 
a sense of the variability of returns.2
 One common method involves considering 
pessimistic (worst), most likely (expected), and optimistic (best) outcomes and 
the returns associated with them for a given asset. In this one measure of an in￾vestment’s risk is the range of possible outcomes. The range is found by subtract￾ing the return associated with the pessimistic outcome from the return associated 
with the optimistic outcome. The greater the range, the more variability, or risk, 
the asset is said to have.
Norman Company, a manufacturer of custom golf equipment, wants to choose 
the better of two investments, A and B. Each requires an initial outlay of $10,000, 
and each has a most likely annual rate of return of 15%. Management has esti￾mated returns associated with each investment’s pessimistic and optimistic
Example 8.2 ▶

analysis are presented in Chapter 12.

outcomes. The three estimates for each asset, along with its range, are given in 
Table 8.2. Asset A appears to be less risky than asset B; its range of 4% (17% 
minus 13%) is less than the range of 16% (23% minus 7%) for asset B. The risk￾averse decision maker would prefer asset A over asset B, because A offers the 
same most likely return as B (15%) with lower risk (smaller range).
It’s not unusual for financial managers to think about the best and worst possible 
outcomes when they are in the early stages of analyzing a new investment project. No 
matter how great the intuitive appeal of this approach, looking at the range of out￾comes that an investment might produce is a very unsophisticated way of measuring 
its risk. More sophisticated methods require some basic statistical tools.
Probability distributions
Probability distributions provide a more quantitative insight into an asset’s 
risk. The probability of a given outcome is its chance of occurring. An outcome 
with an 80 percent probability of occurrence would be expected to occur 8 out 
of 10 times. An outcome with a probability of 100 percent is certain to occur. 
Outcomes with a probability of zero will never occur.
probability
The chance that a given 
outcome will occur.
Norman Company’s past estimates indicate that the probabilities of the pessimis￾tic, most likely, and optimistic outcomes are 25%, 50%, and 25%, respectively. 
Note that the sum of these probabilities must equal 100%; that is, they must be 
based on all the alternatives considered.
Example 8.3 ▶

Beware of the Black Swan
I
s it ever possible to know for sure that a particular outcome can never happen, that the chance 
of it occurring is 0 percent? In the 2007 best seller The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly 
Improbable, Nassim Nicholas Taleb argues that seemingly improbable or even impossible events 
are more likely to occur than most people believe, especially in the area of finance. The book’s 
title refers to a long-held belief that all swans were white, a belief held by many people until a 
black variety was discovered in Australia. Taleb reportedly earned a large fortune during the 
2007–2008 financial crisis by betting that financial markets would plummet.

A probability distribution is a model that relates probabilities to the associ￾ated outcomes. The simplest type of probability distribution is the bar chart. 
The bar charts for Norman Company’s assets A and B are shown in Figure 8.1. 
Although both assets have the same average return, the range of return is much 
greater, or more dispersed, for asset B than for asset A: 16 percent versus 
4 percent.
Most investments have more than two or three possible outcomes. In fact, 
the number of possible outcomes in most cases is practically infinite. If we knew 
all the possible outcomes and associated probabilities, we could develop a 
continuous probability distribution. This type of distribution can be thought of 
as a bar chart for a very large number of outcomes. Figure 8.2 presents continuous 
probability distributions for assets C and D. Note that although the two assets 
have the same average return (15 percent), the distribution of returns for asset D 
has much greater dispersion than the distribution for asset C. Apparently, asset D 
is more risky than asset C.
RISK MEASuREMENT
In addition to considering the range of returns that an investment might produce, 
the risk of an asset can be measured quantitatively by using statistics. The most 
common statistical measure used to describe an investment’s risk is its standard 
deviation.

those that would result from using decimal form. Regardless, the resulting standard deviations are correct 
and identical to those that would result from using decimal rather than percentage form.370 PART 4   Risk and the Required Rate of Return
Historical Returns and Risk We can now use the standard deviation as a 
measure of risk to assess the historical (1900–2011) investment return data in 
Table 8.1. Table 8.5 repeats the historical nominal average returns in column 1 
and shows the standard deviations associated with each of them in column 2. A 
close relationship can be seen between the investment returns and the standard 
deviations: Investments with higher returns have higher standard deviations. For 
example, stocks have the highest average return at 9.3 percent, which is more 
than double the average return on Treasury bills. At the same time, stocks are 
much more volatile, with a standard deviation of 20.2 percent, more than four 
times greater than the standard deviation of Treasury bills. Because higher stan￾dard deviations are associated with greater risk, the historical data confirm the 
existence of a positive relationship between risk and return. That relationship 
reflects risk aversion by market participants, who require higher returns as com￾pensation for greater risk. The historical data in columns 1 and 2 of Table 8.5 
clearly show that during the 1900–2011 period, investors were, on average, re￾warded with higher returns on higher-risk investments.
Matter of fact
All Stocks Are Not Created Equal
T
able 8.5 shows that stocks are riskier than bonds, but are some stocks riskier than others? 
The answer is emphatically yes. A recent study examined the historical returns of large 
stocks and small stocks and found that the average annual return on large stocks from 1926 
through 2011 was 9.8 percent, while small stocks earned 11.9 percent per year on average. 
The higher returns on small stocks came with a cost, however. The standard deviation of small 
stock returns was a whopping 32.8 percent, whereas the standard deviation on large stocks 
was just 20.5 percent.
Normal Distribution A normal probability distribution, depicted in Figure 
8.3, resembles a symmetrical “bell-shaped” curve. The symmetry of the curve 
means that half the probability is associated with the values to the left of the peak 
and half with the values to the right. As noted on the figure, for normal probabil￾ity distributions, 68 percent of the possible outcomes will lie between ±1 standard 
deviation from the expected return, 95 percent of all outcomes will lie between 
±2 standard deviations from the expected return, and 99 percent of all outcomes 
will lie between ±3 standard deviations from the expected return.

TABLE 8.5ChAPTER 8   Risk and Return 371
Using the data in Table 8.5 and assuming that the probability distributions of 
returns for common stocks and bonds are normal, we can surmise that 68% of 
the possible outcomes would have a return ranging between -10.9, and 29.5% 
for stocks and between -5.3, and 15.3% for bonds; 95% of the possible return 
outcomes would range between -31.1, and 49.7% for stocks and 
between -15.6, and 25.6% for bonds. The greater risk of stocks is clearly 
reflected in their much wider range of possible returns for each level of confidence 
(68% or 95%).
Coefficient of Variation: Trading Off Risk and Return
The coefficient of variation, CV, is a measure of relative dispersion that is useful 
in comparing the risks of assets with differing expected returns. The expression 
for the coefficient of variation can be given by
Example 8.6 ▶

dispersion that is useful in

CV =

(8.4)
A higher coefficient of variation means that an investment has more volatility 
relative to its expected return. Because investors prefer higher returns and less 
risk, one might intuitively expect investors to gravitate towards investments with 
a low coefficient of variation. However, this logic doesn’t always apply for rea￾sons that will emerge in the next section. For now, consider the coefficients of 
variation in column 3 of Table 8.5. That table reveals that Treasury bills have the 
lowest coefficient of variation and therefore the lowest risk relative to their re￾turn. Does that mean that investors should load up on Treasury bills and divest 
themselves of stocks? Not necessarily.
When the standard deviations (from Table 8.4) and the expected returns (from 
Table 8.3) for assets A and B are substituted into Equation 8.4, the coefficients of 
variation for A and B are 0.094 (1.41% , 15%) and 0.377 (5.66% , 15%), 
respectively. Asset B has the higher coefficient of variation and is therefore more 
risky than asset A, which we already know from the standard deviation. (Because 
both assets have the same expected return, the coefficient of variation has not 
provided any new information.)

concerns is risk; as a rule, she will invest only in stocks with a coefficient of varia￾tion below 0.75. She has gathered price and dividend data (shown in the accom￾panying table) for DII over the past 3 years, 2013–2015, and assumes that each 
year’s return is equally probable.
Personal Finance Example 8.8 ▶
Substituting the price and dividend data for each year into Equation 8.1, we get 
the following information:
Year Returns
2013 3$3.50 + ($36.50 - $35.00) 4 , $35.00 = $5.00 , $35.00 = 14.3,
2014 3$3.50 + ($34.50 - $36.50) 4 , $36.50 = $1.50 , $36.50 = 4.1,
2015 3$4.00 + ($35.00 - $34.50) 4 , $34.50 = $4.50 , $34.50 = 13.0,
Substituting into Equation 8.2a, given that the returns are equally probable, we 
get the average return, r2013-2015:
r2013-2015 = (14.3, + 4.1, + 13.0,) , 3 = 10.5,
Substituting the average return and annual returns into Equation 8.3a, we get the 
standard deviation, sr2013-2015:
sr2013-2015 = 23(14.3, - 10.5,)
2 + (4.1,-10.5,)
2 + (13.0, - 10.5,)

4 , (3 - 1)
= 2(14.44, + 40.96, + 6.25,) , 2 = 230.825, = 5.6,
Finally, substituting the standard deviation of returns and the average return into 
Equation 8.4, we get the coefficient of variation, CV:
CV = 5.6, , 10.5, = 0.53
Because the coefficient of variation of returns on the DII stock over 
the 2013–2015 period of 0.53 is well below Marilyn’s maximum coefficient 
of variation of 0.75, she concludes that the DII stock would be an acceptable 
investment.

8.3 Risk of a Portfolio
In real-world situations, the risk of any single investment would not be viewed 
independently of other assets. New investments must be considered in light of 
their impact on the risk and return of an investor’s portfolio of assets. The finan￾cial manager’s goal is to create an efficient portfolio, one that provides the maxi￾mum return for a given level of risk. We therefore need a way to measure the re￾turn and the standard deviation of a portfolio of assets. As part of that analysis, 
we will look at the statistical concept of correlation, which underlies the process 
of diversification that is used to develop an efficient portfolio.
PORTFOLIO RETuRN ANd STANdARd dEVIATION
The return on a portfolio is a weighted average of the returns on the individual 
assets from which it is formed. We can use Equation 8.5 to find the portfolio 
return, rp

James purchases 100 shares of Wal-Mart at a price of $55 per share, so his total 
investment in Wal-Mart is $5,500. He also buys 100 shares of Cisco Systems at 
$25 per share, so the total investment in Cisco stock is $2,500. Combining these 
two holdings, James’s total portfolio is worth $8,000. Of the total, 68.75% is in￾vested in Wal-Mart ($5,500 , $8,000), and 31.25% is invested in Cisco Systems 
($2,500 , $8,000). Thus, w1 = 0.6875, w2 = 0.3125, and w1 + w2 = 1.0.
The standard deviation of a portfolio’s returns is found by applying the for￾mula for the standard deviation of a single asset. Specifically, Equation 8.3 is used 
when the probabilities of the returns are known, and Equation 8.3a (from footnote 
4) is applied when analysts use historical data to estimate the standard deviation.

Assume that we wish to determine the expected value and standard deviation of 
returns for portfolio XY, created by combining equal portions (50% each) of as￾sets X and Y. The forecasted returns of assets X and Y for each of the next 5 
years (2014–2018) are given in columns 1 and 2, respectively, in part A of Table

respective returns from columns 1 and 2 are substituted into Equation 8.5. Col￾umn 4 shows the results of the calculation: an expected portfolio return of 12% 
for each year, 2014 to 2018.
Furthermore, as shown in part B of Table 8.6, the expected value of these 
portfolio returns over the 5-year period is also 12% (calculated by using Equa￾tion 8.2a, in footnote 3). In part C of Table 8.6, portfolio XY’s standard devia￾tion is calculated to be 0% (using Equation 8.3a, in footnote 4). This value should 
not be surprising because the portfolio return each year is the same: 12%. Portfo￾lio returns do not vary through time.

CORRELATION
Correlation is a statistical measure of the relationship between any two series of 
numbers. The numbers may represent data of any kind, from returns to test 
scores. If two series tend to vary in the same direction, they are positively corre￾lated. If the series vary in opposite directions, they are negatively correlated. For 
example, suppose that we gathered data on the retail price and weight of new 
cars. It is likely that we would find that larger cars cost more than smaller ones, 
so we would say that among new cars, weight and price are positively correlated. 
If we also measured the fuel efficiency of these vehicles (as measured by the num￾ber of miles they can travel per gallon of gasoline), we would find that lighter cars 
are more fuel efficient than heavier cars. In that case, we would say that fuel 
economy and vehicle weight are negatively correlated.5
The degree of correlation is measured by the correlation coefficient, which 
ranges from +1 for perfectly positively correlated series to -1 for perfectly 
negatively correlated series. These two extremes are depicted for series M and N 
in Figure 8.4. The perfectly positively correlated series move exactly together 
without exception; the perfectly negatively correlated series move in exactly op￾posite directions.
dIVERSIFICATION
The concept of correlation is essential to developing an efficient portfolio. To 
reduce overall risk, it is best to diversify by combining, or adding to the port￾folio, assets that have the lowest possible correlation. Combining assets that 
have a low correlation with each other can reduce the overall variability of a 
portfolio’s returns. Figure 8.5 shows the returns that two assets, F and G, 
earn over time. Both assets earn the same average or expected return, r, but 
note that when F’s return is above average, the return on G is below average 
and vice versa. In other words, returns on F and G are negatively correlated, 
and when these two assets are combined in a portfolio, the risk of that port￾folio falls without reducing the average return (that is, the portfolio’s average 
return is also r). For risk-averse investors, that is very good news. They get rid

economy than a smaller sedan powered by a conventional gasoline engine, but that does not change the general 
tendency that lighter cars achieve better fuel economy.

of something they don’t like (risk) without having to sacrifice what they do 
like (return). Even if assets are positively correlated, the lower the correlation 
between them, the greater the risk reduction that can be achieved through 
diversification.
Some assets are uncorrelated; that is, there is no interaction between their 
returns. Combining uncorrelated assets can reduce risk, not as effectively as com￾bining negatively correlated assets but more effectively than combining positively 
correlated assets. The correlation coefficient for uncorrelated assets is close to 
zero and acts as the midpoint between perfectly positive and perfectly negative 
correlation.
The creation of a portfolio that combines two assets with perfectly posi￾tively correlated returns results in overall portfolio risk that at minimum 
equals that of the least risky asset and at maximum equals that of the most 
risky asset. However, a portfolio combining two assets with less than per￾fectly positive correlation can reduce total risk to a level below that of either 
of the components. For example, assume that you buy stock in a company 
that manufactures machine tools. The business is very cyclical, so the stock 
will do well when the economy is expanding, and it will do poorly during a 
recession. If you bought shares in another machine-tool company, with sales 
positively correlated with those of your firm, the combined portfolio would 
still be cyclical, and risk would not be reduced a great deal. Alternatively, 
however, you could buy stock in a discount retailer, whose sales are counter￾cyclical. It typically performs worse during economic expansions than it does 
during recessions (when consumers are trying to save money on every pur￾chase). A portfolio that contained both of these stocks might be less volatile 
than either stock on its own.
Table 8.7 presents the forecasted returns from three different assets—X, Y, and 
Z—over the next 5 years, along with their expected values and standard devia￾tions. Each of the assets has an expected return of 12% and a standard deviation 
of 3.16%. The assets therefore have equal return and equal risk. The return pat￾terns of assets X and Y are perfectly negatively correlated. When X enjoys its 
highest return, Y experiences its lowest return and vice versa. The returns of as￾sets X and Z are perfectly positively correlated. They move in precisely the same 
direction, so when the return on X is high, so is the return on Z. (Note: The

returns for X and Z are identical.)6
 Now let’s consider what happens when we 
combine these assets in different ways to form portfolios.
Portfolio XY Portfolio XY (shown in Table 8.7) is created by combining equal 
portions of assets X and Y, the perfectly negatively correlated assets. (Calculation 
of portfolio XY’s annual returns, the expected portfolio return, and the standard 
deviation of returns was demonstrated in Table 8.6 on page 374.) The risk in this 
portfolio, as reflected by its standard deviation, is reduced to 0%, whereas the 
expected return remains at 12%. Thus, the combination results in the complete 
elimination of risk because in each and every year the portfolio earns a 12% re￾turn.7 Whenever assets are perfectly negatively correlated, some combination of 
the two assets exists such that the resulting portfolio’s returns are risk free.
Portfolio XZ Portfolio XZ (shown in Table 8.7) is created by combining equal 
portions of assets X and Z, the perfectly positively correlated assets. Individually, 
assets X and Z have the same standard deviation, 3.16%, and because they always 
move together, combining them in a portfolio does nothing to reduce risk; the 
6. Identical return streams are used in this example to permit clear illustration of the concepts, but it is not necessary 
for return streams to be identical for them to be perfectly positively correlated. Any return streams that move exactly 
together—regardless of the relative magnitude of the returns—are perfectly positively correlated.
7. Perfect negative correlation means that the ups and downs experienced by one asset are exactly offset by move￾ments in the other asset. Therefore, the portfolio return does not vary over time.

aPortfolio XY, which consists of 50 percent of asset X and 50 percent of asset Y, illustrates perfect negative correlation because these two return 
streams behave in completely opposite fashion over the 5-year period. Its return values shown here were calculated in part A of Table 8.6.
bPortfolio XZ, which consists of 50 percent of asset X and 50 percent of asset Z, illustrates perfect positive correlation because these two return 
streams behave identically over the 5-year period. Its return values were calculated by using the same method demonstrated for portfolio XY in part 
A of Table 8.6.
cBecause the probabilities associated with the returns are not given, the general equations, Equation 8.2a in footnote 3 and Equation 8.3a in foot￾note 4, were used to calculate expected values and standard deviations, respectively. Calculation of the expected value and standard deviation for 
portfolio XY is demonstrated in parts B and C, respectively, of Table 8.6.

portfolio standard deviation is also 3.16%. As was the case with portfolio XY, the 
expected return of portfolio XZ is 12%. Because both of these portfolios provide 
the same expected return, but portfolio XY achieves that expected return with no 
risk, portfolio XY is clearly preferred by risk-averse investors over portfolio XZ.
CORRELATION, dIVERSIFICATION, RISK, ANd RETuRN
In general, the lower the correlation between asset returns, the greater the risk 
reduction that investors can achieve by diversifying. The following example il￾lustrates how correlation influences the risk of a portfolio but not the portfolio’s 
expected return.
Consider two assets—Lo and Hi—with the characteristics described in the fol￾lowing table.
Example 8.12 ▶
Asset
Expected 
return, r
Risk (standard 
deviation), s
Lo 6% 3%
Hi 8 8
Clearly, asset Lo offers a lower return than Hi does, but Lo is also less risky than 
Hi. It is natural to think that a portfolio combining Lo and Hi would offer a re￾turn that is between 6% and 8% and that the portfolio’s risk would also fall be￾tween the risk of Lo and Hi (between 3% and 8%). That intuition is only partly 
correct.
The performance of a portfolio consisting of assets Lo and Hi depends not 
only on the expected return and standard deviation of each asset (given above), 
but also on how the returns on the two assets are correlated. We will illustrate the 
results of three specific scenarios: (1) returns on Lo and Hi are perfectly positively 
correlated, (2) returns on Lo and Hi are uncorrelated, and (3) returns on Lo and 
Hi are perfectly negatively correlated.
The results of the analysis appear in Figure 8.6. Whether the correlation be￾tween Lo and Hi is 11, 0, or 21, a portfolio of those two assets must have an 
expected return between 6% and 8%. That is why the line segments at left in 
Figure 8.6 all range between 6% and 8%. However, the standard deviation of a 
portfolio depends critically on the correlation between Lo and Hi. Only when Lo 
and Hi are perfectly positively correlated can it be said that the portfolio standard 
deviation must fall between 3% (Lo’s standard deviation) and 8% (Hi’s standard 
deviation). As the correlation between Lo and Hi becomes weaker (that is, as the 
correlation coefficient falls), investors may find that they can form portfolios of 
Lo and Hi with standard deviations that are even less than 3% (that is, portfolios 
that are less risky than holding asset Lo by itself). That is why the line segments 
at right in Figure 8.6 vary. In the special case when Lo and Hi are perfectly nega￾tively correlated, it is possible to diversify away all the risk and form a portfolio 
that is risk free.

INTERNATIONAL dIVERSIFICATION
One excellent practical example of portfolio diversification involves including 
foreign assets in a portfolio. The inclusion of assets from countries with busi￾ness cycles that are not highly correlated with the U.S. business cycle reduces 
the portfolio’s responsiveness to market movements. The ups and the downs of 
different markets around the world offset one another, at least to some extent, 
and the result is a portfolio that is less risky than one invested entirely in the 
U.S. market.
Returns from International diversification
Over long periods, internationally diversified portfolios tend to perform better 
(meaning that they earn higher returns relative to the risks taken) than purely 
domestic portfolios. However, over shorter periods such as 1 or 2 years, inter￾nationally diversified portfolios may perform better or worse than domestic 
portfolios. For example, consider what happens when the U.S. economy is per￾forming relatively poorly and the dollar is depreciating in value against most 
foreign currencies. At such times, the dollar returns to U.S. investors on a port￾folio of foreign assets can be very attractive. However, international diversifica￾tion can yield subpar returns, particularly when the dollar is appreciating in 
value relative to other currencies. When the U.S. currency appreciates, the dol￾lar value of a foreign-currency-denominated portfolio of assets declines. Even if 
this portfolio yields a satisfactory return in foreign currency, the return to U.S. 
investors will be reduced when foreign profits are translated into dollars. Sub￾par local currency portfolio returns, coupled with an appreciating dollar, can 
yield truly dismal dollar returns to U.S. investors.
Overall, though, the logic of international portfolio diversification assumes 
that these fluctuations in currency values and relative performance will average 
out over long periods. Compared to similar, purely domestic portfolios, an in￾ternationally diversified portfolio will tend to yield a comparable return at a 
lower level of risk.

Risks of International diversification
In addition to the risk induced by currency fluctuations, several other financial 
risks are unique to international investing. Most important is political risk, which 
arises from the possibility that a host government will take actions harmful to 
foreign investors or that political turmoil will endanger investments. Political 
risks are particularly acute in developing countries, where unstable or ideologi￾cally motivated governments may attempt to block return of profits by foreign 
investors or even seize (nationalize) their assets in the host country. For example, 
reflecting President Hugo Chavez’s desire to broaden the country’s socialist revo￾lution, Venezuela maintained a list of priority goods for import that excluded a 
large percentage of the necessary inputs to the automobile production process. As 
a result, Toyota halted auto production in Venezuela, and three other auto manu￾facturers temporarily closed or deeply cut their production there. Chavez also 
forced most foreign energy firms to reduce their stakes and give up control of oil 
projects in Venezuela.

nominal return of 9.3 percent, but that 
return was associated with a relatively 
high standard deviation: 20.2 percent 
per year. Could U.S. investors have 
done better by diversifying globally? 
The answer is a qualified yes. Elroy 
Dimson, Paul Marsh, and Mike 
Staunton calculated the historical 
returns on a portfolio that included U.S. 
stocks as well as stocks from 18 other 
countries. This diversified portfolio pro￾duced returns that were not quite as 
high as the U.S. average, just 8.5 per￾cent per year. However, the globally 
diversified portfolio was also less vola￾tile, with an annual standard deviation 
of 17.7 percent. Dividing the standard 
deviation by the annual return pro￾duces a coefficient of variation for the 
globally diversified portfolio of 2.08, 
slightly lower than the 2.17 coefficient

LG 6 8.4 Risk and Return: The Capital Asset Pricing 
Model (CAPM)
Thus far, we have observed a tendency for riskier investments to earn higher re￾turns, and we have learned that investors can reduce risk through diversification. 
Now we want to quantify the relationship between risk and return. In other 
words, we want to measure how much additional return an investor should expect 
from taking a little extra risk. The classic theory that links risk and return for all 
assets is the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). We will use the CAPM to under￾stand the basic risk–return trade-offs involved in all types of financial decisions.
TYPES OF RISK
In the last section, we saw that the standard deviation of a portfolio is often less 
than the standard deviation of the individual assets in the portfolio. That’s the 
power of diversification. To see this concept more clearly, consider what happens 
to the risk of a portfolio consisting of a single security (asset) to which we add se￾curities randomly selected from, say, the population of all actively traded securities. 
Using the standard deviation of return, srp, to measure the total portfolio risk, 
Figure 8.7 depicts the behavior of the total portfolio risk (y axis) as more securities 
are added (x axis). With the addition of securities, the total portfolio risk declines, 
as a result of diversification, and tends to approach a lower limit.
The total risk of a security can be viewed as consisting of two parts:
capital asset pricing model 
(CAPM)
The basic theory that links risk 
and return for all assets.
total risk
The combination of a security’s 
nondiversifiable risk and 
diversifiable risk.
diversifiable risk
The portion of an asset’s risk 
that is attributable to firm￾specific, random causes; can 
be eliminated through 
diversification. Also called 
unsystematic risk.
nondiversifiable risk
The relevant portion of an 
asset’s risk attributable to 
market factors that affect all 
firms; cannot be eliminated 
through diversification. Also 
called systematic risk.
Total security risk = Nondiversifiable risk + Diversifiable risk (8.6)
Diversifiable risk (sometimes called unsystematic risk) represents the portion of an 
asset’s risk that is associated with random causes that can be eliminated through 
diversification. It is attributable to firm-specific events, such as strikes, lawsuits, 
regulatory actions, or the loss of key accounts. Figure 8.7 shows that diversifiable 
risk gradually disappears as the number of stocks in the portfolio increases. Nondi￾versifiable risk (also called systematic risk) is attributable to market factors that

affect all firms; it cannot be eliminated through diversification. Factors such as war, 
inflation, the overall state of the economy, international incidents, and political 
events account for nondiversifiable risk. In Figure 8.7, nondiversifiable risk is rep￾resented by the horizontal black line below which the blue curve can never go, no 
matter how diversified the portfolio becomes.
Because any investor can easily create a portfolio of assets that will eliminate 
virtually all diversifiable risk, the only relevant risk is nondiversifiable risk. Any 
investor or firm therefore must be concerned solely with nondiversifiable risk. 
The measurement of nondiversifiable risk is thus of primary importance in select￾ing assets with the most desired risk–return characteristics.
ThE MOdEL: CAPM
The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) links nondiversifiable risk to expected 
returns. We will discuss the model in five sections. The first section deals with the 
beta coefficient, which is a measure of nondiversifiable risk. The second section 
presents an equation of the model itself, and the third section graphically de￾scribes the relationship between risk and return. The fourth section discusses the 
effects of changes in inflationary expectations and risk aversion on the relation￾ship between risk and return. The fifth section offers some comments on the 
CAPM.
Beta Coefficient
The beta coefficient, B, is a relative measure of nondiversifiable risk. It is an index of 
the degree of movement of an asset’s return in response to a change in the market 
return. An asset’s historical returns are used in finding the asset’s beta coefficient. The 
market return is the return on the market portfolio of all traded securities. The Stan￾dard & Poor’s 500 Stock Composite Index or some similar stock index is commonly 
used as the market return. Betas for actively traded stocks can be obtained from a 
variety of sources, but you should understand how they are derived and interpreted 
and how they are applied to portfolios.
Deriving Beta from Return Data An asset’s historical returns are used in 
finding the asset’s beta coefficient. Figure 8.8 plots the relationship between the 
returns of two assets—R and S—and the market return. Note that the horizon￾tal (x) axis measures the historical market returns and that the vertical (y) axis 
measures the individual asset’s historical returns. The first step in deriving beta 
involves plotting the coordinates for the market return and asset returns from 
various points in time. Such annual “market return–asset return” coordinates 
are shown for asset S only for the years 2008 through 2015. For example, in 
2015, asset S’s return was 20 percent when the market return was 10 percent. 
By use of statistical techniques, the “characteristic line” that best explains the 
relationship between the asset return and the market return coordinates is fit to 
the data points.8
 The slope of this line is beta. The beta for asset R is about 
0.80, and that for asset S is about 1.30. Asset S’s higher beta (steeper character￾istic line slope) indicates that its return is more responsive to changing market 
returns. Therefore, asset S is more risky than asset R.
beta coefficient (B)

nondiversifiable risk. An index
of the degree of movement of 
an asset’s return in response to 
a change in the market return.
market return
The return on the market 
portfolio of all traded 
securities.
8. The empirical measurement of beta is approached by using least-squares regression analysis.ChAPTER 8   Risk and Return 383
Interpreting Betas The beta coefficient for the entire market equals 1.0. All 
other betas are viewed in relation to this value. Asset betas may be positive or nega￾tive, but positive betas are the norm. The majority of beta coefficients fall between 
0.5 and 2.0. The return of a stock that is half as responsive as the market (b 5 0.5) 
should change by 0.5 percent for each 1 percent change in the return of the market 
portfolio. A stock that is twice as responsive as the market (b 5 2.0) should experi￾ence a 2 percent change in its return for each 1 percent change in the return of the 
market portfolio. Table 8.8 provides various beta values and their interpretations. 
Beta coefficients for actively traded stocks can be obtained from published sources 
such as Value Line Investment Survey, via the Internet, or through brokerage firms. 
Betas for some selected stocks are given in Table 8.9.

TABLE 8.8384 PART 4   Risk and the Required Rate of Return
Portfolio Betas The beta of a portfolio can be easily estimated by using the 
betas of the individual assets it includes. Letting wj
 represent the proportion of 
the portfolio’s total dollar value represented by asset j and letting bj
 equal the 
beta of asset j, we can use Equation 8.7 to find the portfolio beta, bp
:
bp = (w1 * b1
) + (w2 * b2
) + g+ (wn * bn
) = a
n
j=1
wj * bj
(8.7)
Of course, a
n
j=1wj = 1, which means that 100 percent of the portfolio’s assets 
must be included in this computation.
Portfolio betas are interpreted in the same way as the betas of individual as￾sets. They indicate the degree of responsiveness of the portfolio’s return to 
changes in the market return. For example, when the market return increases by 
10 percent, a portfolio with a beta of 0.75 will experience a 7.5 percent increase 
in its return (0.75 * 10,); a portfolio with a beta of 1.25 will experience a 12.5 
percent increase in its return (1.25 * 10,). Clearly, a portfolio containing 
mostly low-beta assets will have a low beta, and one containing mostly high-beta 
assets will have a high beta.
Mario Austino, an individual investor, wishes to assess the risk 
of two small portfolios he is considering, V and W. Both port￾folios contain five assets, with the proportions and betas shown in Table 8.10. 
The betas for the two portfolios, bV and bW, can be calculated by substituting 
data from the table into Equation 8.7:
bV = (0.10 * 1.65) + (0.30 * 1.00) + (0.20 * 1.30) + (0.20 * 1.10) + (0.20 * 1.25)
= 0.165 + 0.300 + 0.260 + 0.220 + 0.250 = 1.20
bW = (0.10 * 0.80) + (0.10 * 1.00) + (0.20 * 0.65) + (0.10 * 0.75) + (0.50 * 1.05)
= 0.080 + 0.100 + 0.130 + 0.075 + 0.525 = 0.91

Portfolio V’s beta is about 1.20, and portfolio W’s is 0.91. These values make 
sense because portfolio V contains relatively high-beta assets, and portfolio W 
contains relatively low-beta assets. Mario’s calculations show that portfolio V’s 
returns are more responsive to changes in market returns and are therefore more 
risky than portfolio W’s. He must now decide which, if either, portfolio he feels 
comfortable adding to his existing investments.
The Equation
Using the beta coefficient to measure nondiversifiable risk, the capital asset pric￾ing model (CAPM) is given by
rj = RF + 3bj * (rm - RF
) 4 (8.8)
where
rj = required return on asset j
RF = risk@free rate of return, commonly measured by the return
on a U.S. Treasury bill
bj = beta coefficient or index of nondiversifiable risk for asset j
rm = market return; return on the market portfolio of assets
The CAPM can be divided into two parts: (1) the risk-free rate of return, RF
,
which is the required return on a risk-free asset, typically a 3-month U.S. Trea￾sury bill (T-bill), a short-term IOU issued by the U.S. Treasury; and (2) the risk 
premium. These parts are, respectively, the two elements on either side of the plus 
sign in Equation 8.8. The (rm - RF
) portion of the risk premium is called the 
market risk premium because it represents the premium that the investor must 
receive for taking the average amount of risk associated with holding the market 
portfolio of assets.
Historical Risk Premiums Using the historical return data for stocks, 
bonds, and Treasury bills for the 1900–2011 period shown in Table 8.2, we 
can calculate the risk premiums for each investment category. The calculation 
(consistent with Equation 8.8) involves merely subtracting the historical U.S. 
risk-free rate of return (RF
 )

Reviewing the risk premiums calculated above, we can see that the risk pre￾mium is higher for stocks than for bonds. This outcome makes sense intuitively 
because stocks are riskier than bonds (equity is riskier than debt).
Benjamin Corporation, a growing computer software developer, wishes to deter￾mine the required return on an asset Z, which has a beta of 1.5. The risk-free rate 
of return is 7%; the return on the market portfolio of assets is 11%. Substituting 
bZ = 1.5, RF = 7,, and rm = 11, into the capital asset pricing model given in 
Equation 8.8 yields a required return of
rZ = 7, + 31.5 * (11, - 7,) 4 = 7, + 6, = 13,
The market risk premium of 4, (11, - 7,), when adjusted for the asset’s 
index of risk (beta) of 1.5, results in a risk premium of 6% (1.5 * 4%). That 
risk premium, when added to the 7% risk-free rate, results in a 13% required 
return.
Other things being equal, the higher the beta, the higher the required return, 
and the lower the beta, the lower the required return.
The Graph: The Security Market Line (SML)
When the capital asset pricing model (Equation 8.8) is depicted graphically, it is 
called the security market line (SML). The SML will, in fact, be a straight line. It 
reflects the required return in the marketplace for each level of nondiversifiable 
risk (beta). In the graph, risk as measured by beta, b, is plotted on the x axis, and 
required returns, r, are plotted on the y axis. The risk–return trade-off is clearly 
represented by the SML.
In the preceding example for Benjamin Corporation, the risk-free rate, RF
, was 
7%, and the market return, rm, was 11%. The SML can be plotted by using 
the two sets of coordinates for the betas associated with RF
 and rm, bRF
 and bm
(that is, bRF
= 0,
9 RF = 7,; and bm = 1.0, rm = 11,). Figure 8.9 presents the 
resulting security market line. As traditionally shown, the security market line in 
Figure 8.9 presents the required return associated with all positive betas. The

9. Because RF
 is the rate of return on a risk-free asset, the beta associated with the risk-free asset, brF
, would equal 0. 
The zero beta on the risk-free asset reflects not only its absence of risk but also that the asset’s return is unaffected 
by movements in the market return.ChAPTER 8   Risk and Return 387
market risk premium of 4% (rm of 11% 2 RF
 of 7%) has been highlighted. For a 
beta for asset Z, bZ, of 1.5, its corresponding required return, rZ, is 13%. Also 
shown in the figure is asset Z’s risk premium of 6% (rZ of 13% 2 RF
 of 7%). It 
should be clear that for assets with betas greater than 1, the risk premium is 
greater than that for the market; for assets with betas less than 1, the risk pre￾mium is less than that for the market.
Shifts in the Security Market Line
The security market line is not stable over time, and shifts in the security market 
line can result in a change in required return. The position and slope of the SML 
are affected by two major forces—inflationary expectations and risk aversion—
which are analyzed next.10
Changes in Inflationary Expectations Changes in inflationary expectations 
affect the risk-free rate of return, RF
. The equation for the risk-free rate of return is

10. A firm’s beta can change over time as a result of changes in the firm’s asset mix, in its financing mix, or in exter￾nal factors not within management’s control, such as earthquakes and toxic spills.
RF = r* + IP (8.9)
This equation shows that, assuming a constant real rate of interest, r*, changes 
in inflationary expectations, reflected in an inflation premium, IP, will result in 
corresponding changes in the risk-free rate. Therefore, a change in inflationary 
expectations that results from events such as international trade embargoes or 
major changes in Federal Reserve policy will result in a shift in the SML. 388 PART 4   Risk and the Required Rate of Return
Because the risk-free rate is a basic component of all rates of return, any change 
in RF
 will be reflected in all required rates of return.
Changes in inflationary expectations result in parallel shifts in the SML in 
direct response to the magnitude and direction of the change. This effect can best 
be illustrated by an example.
In the preceding example, using the CAPM, the required return for asset Z, rZ, 
was found to be 13%. Assuming that the risk-free rate of 7% includes a 2% 
real rate of interest, r*, and a 5% inflation premium, IP, then Equation 8.9 
confirms that
RF = 2, + 5, = 7,
Now assume that recent economic events have resulted in an increase of 3% 
in inflationary expectations, raising the inflation premium to 8% (IP1
). As a re￾sult, all returns likewise rise by 3%. In this case, the new returns (noted by sub￾script 1) are
RF1
= 10, (rises from 7, to 10,)
rm1
= 14, (rises from 11, to 14,)
Substituting these values, along with asset Z’s beta (bZ) of 1.5, into the CAPM 
(Equation 8.8), we find that asset Z’s new required return (rZ1
) can be calculated:
rZ1
= 10, + 31.5 * (14, - 10,) 4 = 10, + 6, = 16,
Comparing rZ1
 of 16% to rZ of 13%, we see that the change of 3% in asset Z’s 
required return exactly equals the change in the inflation premium. The same 3% 
increase results for all assets.
Figure 8.10 depicts the situation just described. It shows that the 3% increase 
in inflationary expectations results in a parallel shift upward of 3% in the SML. 
Clearly, the required returns on all assets rise by 3%. Note that the rise in the 
inflation premium from 5% to 8% (IP to IP1
) causes the risk-free rate to rise 
from 7% to 10% (RF
 to RF1
) and the market return to increase from 11% to 14% 
(rm to rm1
). The security market line therefore shifts upward by 3% (SML to 
SML1
), causing the required return on all risky assets, such as asset Z, to rise by 
3%. The important lesson here is that a given change in inflationary expectations 
will be fully reflected in a corresponding change in the returns of all assets, as 
reflected graphically in a parallel shift of the SML.
Changes in Risk Aversion The slope of the security market line reflects the 
general risk preferences of investors in the marketplace. As discussed earlier, most 
investors are risk averse; that is, they require increased returns for increased risk. 
This positive relationship between risk and return is graphically represented by 
the SML, which depicts the relationship between nondiversifiable risk as meas￾ured by beta (x axis) and the required return (y axis). The slope of the SML re￾flects the degree of risk aversion: the steeper its slope, the greater the degree of 
risk aversion because a higher level of return will be required for each level of risk 
as measured by beta. In other words, risk premiums increase with increasing risk 
avoidance.
Example 8.16 ▶ChAPTER 8   Risk and Return 389
Changes in risk aversion, and therefore shifts in the SML, result from chang￾ing preferences of investors, which generally result from economic, political, or 
social events. Examples of events that increase risk aversion include a stock mar￾ket crash, assassination of a key political leader, and the outbreak of war. In 
general, widely shared expectations of hard times ahead tend to cause investors 
to become more risk averse, requiring higher returns as compensation for accept￾ing a given level of risk. The impact of increased risk aversion on the SML can 
best be demonstrated by an example.
In the preceding examples, the SML in Figure 8.9 reflected a risk-free rate (RF
) of 
7%, a market return (rm) of 11%, a market risk premium (rm - RF
) of 4%, and a 
required return on asset Z (rZ) of 13% with a beta (bZ) of 1.5. Assume that recent 
economic events have made investors more risk averse, causing a new higher 
market return (rm1
) of 14%. Graphically, this change would cause the SML to 
pivot upward as shown in Figure 8.11, causing a new market risk premium 
(rm1
- RF
) of 7%. As a result, the required return on all risky assets will increase. 
For asset Z, with a beta of 1.5, the new required return (rZ1
) can be calculated by 
using the CAPM (Equation 8.8):
rZ1
= 7, + 31.5 * (14, - 7,) 4 = 7, + 10.5, = 17.5%
This value can be seen on the new security market line (SML1
) in Figure 8.11. 
Note that although asset Z’s risk, as measured by beta, did not change, its re￾quired return has increased because of the increased risk aversion reflected in the 
market risk premium. To summarize, greater risk aversion results in higher re￾quired returns for each level of risk. Similarly, a reduction in risk aversion causes 
the required return for each level of risk to decline.

Some Comments on the CAPM
The capital asset pricing model generally relies on historical data. The betas may 
or may not actually reflect the future variability of returns. Therefore, the re￾quired returns specified by the model can be viewed only as rough approxima￾tions. Users of betas commonly make subjective adjustments to the historically 
determined betas to reflect their expectations of the future.
The CAPM was developed to explain the behavior of security prices and 
provide a mechanism whereby investors could assess the impact of a proposed 
security investment on their portfolio’s overall risk and return. It is based on an 
assumed efficient market with the following characteristics: many small inves￾tors, all having the same information and expectations with respect to securi￾ties; no restrictions on investment, no taxes, and no transaction costs; and ra￾tional investors, who view securities similarly and are risk averse, preferring 
higher returns and lower risk.
Although the perfect world described in the preceding paragraph appears to 
be unrealistic, studies have provided support for the existence of the expecta￾tional relationship described by the CAPM in active markets such as the New 
York Stock Exchange. The CAPM also sees widespread use in corporations that 
use the model to assess the required returns that their shareholders demand (and 
therefore the returns that the firm’s managers need to achieve when they invest 
shareholders’ money).

Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
A firm’s risk and expected return directly affect its share price. Risk and return are 
the two key determinants of the firm’s value. It is therefore the financial manager’s 
responsibility to assess carefully the risk and return of all major decisions to en￾sure that the expected returns justify the level of risk being introduced.
The financial manager can expect to achieve the firm’s goal of increasing its 
share price (and thereby benefiting its owners) by taking only those actions that 
earn returns at least commensurate with their risk. Clearly, financial managers 
need to recognize, measure, and evaluate risk–return trade-offs to ensure that 
their decisions contribute to the creation of value for owners.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
LG 1 Understand the meaning and fundamentals of risk, return, and risk pref￾erences. Risk is a measure of the uncertainty surrounding the return that an in￾vestment will produce. The total rate of return is the sum of cash distributions, 
such as interest or dividends, plus the change in the asset’s value over a given pe￾riod, divided by the investment’s beginning-of-period value. Investment returns 
vary both over time and between different types of investments. Investors may 
be risk averse, risk neutral, or risk seeking. Most financial decision makers are 
risk averse. A risk-averse decision maker requires a higher expected return on a 
more risky investment alternative.
LG 2 Describe procedures for assessing and measuring the risk of a single asset.
The risk of a single asset is measured in much the same way as the risk of a 
portfolio of assets. Scenario analysis and probability distributions can be used to 
assess risk. The range, the standard deviation, and the coefficient of variation 
can be used to measure risk quantitatively.
LG 3 Discuss the measurement of return and standard deviation for a portfolio 
and the concept of correlation. The return of a portfolio is calculated as the 392 PART 4   Risk and the Required Rate of Return
weighted average of returns on the individual assets from which it is formed. 
The portfolio standard deviation is found by using the formula for the standard 
deviation of a single asset.
Correlation—the statistical relationship between any two series of numbers—
can be positively correlated, negatively correlated, or uncorrelated. At the extremes, 
the series can be perfectly positively correlated or perfectly negatively correlated.
LG 4 Understand the risk and return characteristics of a portfolio in terms 
of correlation and diversification and the impact of international assets on a 
portfolio. Diversification involves combining assets with low correlation to 
reduce the risk of the portfolio. The range of risk in a two-asset portfolio 
depends on the correlation between the two assets. If they are perfectly 
positively correlated, the portfolio’s risk will be between the individual assets’ 
risks. If they are perfectly negatively correlated, the portfolio’s risk will be 
between the risk of the more risky asset and zero.
International diversification can further reduce a portfolio’s risk. Foreign 
assets have the risk of currency fluctuation and political risks.
LG 5 Review the two types of risk and the derivation and role of beta in measur￾ing the relevant risk of both a security and a portfolio. The total risk of a security 
consists of nondiversifiable and diversifiable risk. Diversifiable risk can be elimi￾nated through diversification. Nondiversifiable risk is the only relevant risk. 
Nondiversifiable risk is measured by the beta coefficient, which is a relative mea￾sure of the relationship between an asset’s return and the market return. Beta is 
derived by finding the slope of the “characteristic line” that best explains the his￾torical relationship between the asset’s return and the market return. The beta of a 
portfolio is a weighted average of the betas of the individual assets that it includes.
LG 6 Explain the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), its relationship to the 
security market line (SML), and the major forces causing shifts in the SML. 
The CAPM uses beta to relate an asset’s risk relative to the market to the asset’s 
required return. The graphical depiction of the CAPM is SML, which shifts over 
time in response to changing inflationary expectations and/or changes in inves￾tor risk aversion. Changes in inflationary expectations result in parallel shifts in 
the SML. Increasing risk aversion results in a steepening in the slope of the SML. 
Decreasing risk aversion reduces the slope of the SML. Although it has some 
shortcomings, the CAPM provides a useful conceptual framework for evaluating 
and linking risk and return.

Warm-up Exercises  All problems are available in MyFinancelab.
 E8–1 An analyst predicted last year that the stock of Logistics, Inc., would offer a total return 
of at least 10% in the coming year. At the beginning of the year, the firm had a stock 
market value of $10 million. At the end of the year, it had a market value of $12 million 
even though it experienced a loss, or negative net income, of $2.5 million. Did the ana￾lyst’s prediction prove correct? Explain using the values for total annual return.
 E8–2 Four analysts cover the stock of Fluorine Chemical. One forecasts a 5% return for 
the coming year. The second expects the return to be negative 5%. The third 
predicts a 10% return. The fourth expects a 3% return in the coming year. You are 
relatively confident that the return will be positive but not large, so you arbitrarily 
assign probabilities of being correct of 35%, 5%, 20%, and 40%, respectively, to 
the analysts’ forecasts. Given these probabilities, what is Fluorine Chemical’s 
expected return for the coming year?
 E8–3 The expected annual returns are 15% for investment 1 and 12% for investment 
2. The standard deviation of the first investment’s return is 10%; the second invest￾ment’s return has a standard deviation of 5%. Which investment is less risky based 
solely on standard deviation? Which investment is less risky based on coefficient of 
variation? Which is a better measure given that the expected returns of the two 
investments are not the same?
 E8–4 Suppose you are the fund manager of a portfolio that has three asset classes. U.S. 
government T-bills account for 25% of the portfolio, large-company stocks consti￾tute 50%, and small-company stocks make up the remaining 25%. If the expected 
returns are 4.8% for the T-bills, 15.2% for the large-company stocks, and 23.4% 
for the small-company stocks, what is the expected return of the portfolio?

 P8–1 Rate of return A financial analyst for Smart Securities Limited, Paul Chan, wishes to 
estimate the rate of return for two similar-risk investments, A and B. Paul’s research 
indicates that the immediate past returns will serve as reasonable estimates of future 
returns. A year ago, investment A and investment B had market values of $63,000 
and $35,000, respectively. During the year, investment A generated cash flows of 
$6,100, and investment B generated cash flows of $2,800. The current market 
 values of investments A and B are $71,000 and $32,000, respectively.

ften listed among America’s most admired 
corporations, Alcoa, Inc., is the world’s 
largest producer of aluminum, with more than 
61,000 employees in 30 countries. A quick 
glance at its financial statements might suggest 
that the company has been doing very well in 
recent years. Alcoa increased its total sales from 
$18.4 billion in 2009 to $23.7 billion in 2012, 
an annual growth rate of almost 9 percent, far 
exceeding overall economic growth over the 
same period. In each of those years, Alcoa spent 
more than $1 billion on capital expenditures, 
expanding and upgrading its manufacturing 
facilities, entering new joint ventures, and making strategic acquisitions.
During that span, however, Alcoa’s stock underperformed. During the 5-year period ending in 
May 2013, Alcoa common stock lost almost 80 percent of its value, while the broader stock market 
(as measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Composite Index) rose by about 20 percent. 
Why did Alcoa perform so poorly? A simple answer is that its business investments failed to earn a 
return sufficient to meet the expectations of investors. Despite Alcoa’s continued growth, the rate of 
return that it earned on the assets that it had invested was not sufficient to satisfy investors. When a 
firm’s operating results disappoint investors, its stock price will fall as investors sell their shares and 
move to a more attractive investment. According to some estimates, Alcoa’s cost of capital 
exceeded 12 percent, but its investments were consistently earning returns below 5 percent. That 
is a recipe for a declining stock price, which is precisely what Alcoa had been experiencing for 
several years.
For companies to succeed, their investments have to earn a rate of return that exceeds 
investors’ expectations. How, though, do companies know what investors expect? The answer 
is that companies have to measure their cost of capital. Read on to learn how firms do that.

 9.1 Overview of the Cost of Capital
Chapter 1 established that the goal of the firm is to maximize shareholder 
wealth. To do so, managers must make investments that are worth more than 
they cost. In this chapter, you will learn about the cost of capital, which is the 
rate of return that financial managers use to evaluate all possible investment 
opportunities to determine which ones add value to the firm. The cost of capital
represents the firm’s cost of financing and is the minimum rate of return that a 
project must earn to increase firm value. In particular, the cost of capital refers 
to the cost of the next dollar of financing necessary to finance a new investment 
opportunity. Investments with a rate of return above the cost of capital will 
increase the value of the firm, because these investments are worth more than 
they cost. In contrast, projects with a rate of return below the cost of capital 
will decrease firm value.
The cost of capital is an extremely important financial concept. It acts as a 
major link between the firm’s long-term investment decisions and the wealth of 
the firm’s owners as determined by the market value of their shares. Financial 
managers are ethically bound to invest only in projects that they expect to ex￾ceed the cost of capital; see the Focus on Ethics box for more discussion of this 
responsibility.

Business Week once 
referred to Peter 
Drucker as “The Man Who Invented 
Management.” In his role as writer and 
management consultant, Drucker stressed 
the importance of ethics to business lead￾ers. He believed that it was the ethical 
responsibility of a business to earn a 
profit. In his mind, profitable businesses 
create opportunities, whereas unprofit￾able ones waste society’s resources. 
Drucker once said, “Profit is not the 
explanation, cause, or rationale of busi￾ness behavior and business decisions, 
but rather the test of their validity. If arch￾angels instead of businessmen sat in 
directors’ chairs, they would still have to 
be concerned with profitability, despite 
their total lack of personal interest in 
making profits.”a
But what happens when businesses 
abandon ethics for profits? Consider 
Merck’s experience with the drug, 
Vioxx. Introduced in 1999, Vioxx was 
an immediate success, quickly reach￾ing $2.5 billion in annual sales. How￾ever, a Merck study launched in 1999 
eventually found that patients who took 
Vioxx suffered from an increased risk of 
heart attacks and strokes. Despite the 
risks, Merck continued to market and 
sell Vioxx. By the time Vioxx was with￾drawn from the market, an estimated 
20 million Americans had taken the 
drug, 88,000 had suffered Vioxx￾related heart attacks, and 38,000 
had died.
News of the 2004 Vioxx with￾drawal hit Merck’s stock hard. The com￾pany’s shares fell 27 percent on the 
day of the announcement, slashing $27 
billion off the firm’s market capitaliza￾tion. Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s, and 
Fitch cut Merck’s credit ratings, costing 
the firm its coveted AAA rating. The 
company’s bottom line also suffered as 
its net income fell 21 percent in the final 
three months of 2004.
The recall dealt a major blow to 
Merck’s reputation. The company was 
criticized for aggressively marketing 
Vioxx despite the drug’s serious side 
effects. Questions were also raised 
about the research reports Merck had 
submitted in support of the drug. Law￾suits followed. In 2008, Merck agreed 
to fund a $4.85 billion settlement to 
resolve approximately 50,000 Vioxx￾related lawsuits. The company had also 
incurred $1.53 billion in legal costs by 
the time of the settlement.

ThE BASIC CONCEPT
A firm’s cost of capital reflects the expected average future cost of funds over the 
long run, and it reflects the entirety of the firm’s financing activities. For exam￾ple, a firm may raise the money it needs to build a new manufacturing facility by 
borrowing money (debt), by selling common stock (equity), or by doing both. 
Managers must take into account respective costs of both forms of capital when 
they estimate a firm’s cost of capital. In fact, most firms do finance their activi￾ties with a blend of equity and debt. In Chapter 13, we will explore the factors 
that determine what mix of debt and equity is optimal for any particular firm. 
For now, we will simply say that most firms have a desired mix of financing, and 
the cost of capital must reflect the cost of each type of financing that a firm uses. 
To capture all the relevant financing costs, assuming some desired mix of financ￾ing, we need to look at the overall cost of capital rather than just the cost of any 
single source of financing.
A firm is currently considering two investment opportunities. Two financial ana￾lysts, working independently of each other, are evaluating these opportunities. 
Assume the following information about investments A and B.
Investment A
 Cost = $100,000
 Life = 20 years
 Expected Return = 7,
The analyst studying this investment recalls that the company recently issued 
bonds paying a 6% rate of return. He reasons that because the investment project 
earns 7% while the firm can issue debt at 6%, the project must be worth doing, 
so he recommends that the company undertake this investment.
Investment B
 Cost = $100,000
 Life = 20 years
 Expected Return = 12,
Least costly financing source available
Equity = 14,
The analyst assigned to this project knows that the firm has common stock out￾standing and that investors who hold the company’s stock expect a 14% return 
on their investment. The analyst decides that the firm should not undertake this 
investment because it only produces a 12% return while the company’s share￾holders expect a 14% return.
In this example, each analyst is making a mistake by focusing on one source 
of financing rather than on the overall financing mix. What if instead the analysts 
used a combined cost of financing? By weighting the cost of each source of financ￾ing by its relative proportion in the firm’s target capital structure, the firm can 
obtain a weighted average cost of capital. Assuming that this firm desires a 50–50 
mix of debt and equity, the weighted average cost here would be 
10,3 (0.50 * 6, debt) + (0.50 * 14, equity) 4 . With this average cost of 
Example 9.1 ▶

Video412 PART 4   Risk and the Required Rate of Return
financing, the firm should reject the first opportunity (7% expected return 6 10% 
weighted average cost) and accept the second (12% expected return 7 10% 
weighted average cost).
SOuRCES OF LONG-TERM CAPITAL
In this chapter, our concern is only with the long-term sources of capital avail￾able to a firm because they are the sources that supply the financing necessary 
to support the firm’s capital budgeting activities. Capital budgeting is the pro￾cess of evaluating and selecting long-term investments. This process is intended 
to achieve the firm’s goal of maximizing shareholders’ wealth. Although the 
entire capital budgeting process is discussed throughout Part 5, at this point it 
is sufficient to say that capital budgeting activities are chief among the respon￾sibilities of financial managers and that they cannot be carried out without 
knowing the appropriate cost of capital with which to judge the firm’s invest￾ment opportunities.
There are four basic sources of long-term capital for firms: long-term debt, 
preferred stock, common stock, and retained earnings. All entries on the right￾hand side of the balance sheet, other than current liabilities, represent these 
sources:
Not every firm will use all of these sources of financing. In particular, preferred 
stock is relatively uncommon. Even so, most firms will have some mix of funds 
from these sources in their capital structures. Although a firm’s existing mix of 
financing sources may reflect its target capital structure, it is ultimately the mar￾ginal cost of capital necessary to raise the next marginal dollar of financing that 
is relevant for evaluating the firm’s future investment opportunities.

9.2 Cost of Long-Term debt
The cost of long-term debt is the financing cost associated with new funds raised 
through long-term borrowing. Typically, the funds are raised through the sale of 
corporate bonds.
NET PROCEEdS
The net proceeds from the sale of a bond, or any security, are the funds that the 
firm receives from the sale. The total proceeds are reduced by the flotation costs, 
which represent the total costs of issuing and selling securities. These costs apply 
to all public offerings of securities: debt, preferred stock, and common stock. 
They include two components: (1) underwriting costs, or compensation earned 
by investment bankers for selling the security; and (2) administrative costs, or 
issuer expenses such as legal and accounting costs.
Duchess Corporation, a major hardware manufacturer, is contemplating selling 
$10 million worth of 20-year, 9% coupon (stated annual interest rate) bonds, 
each with a par value of $1,000. Because bonds with similar risk earn returns 
greater than 9%, the firm must sell the bonds for $980 to compensate for the 
lower coupon interest rate. The flotation costs are 2% of the par value of the 
bond (0.02 * $1,000), or $20. The net proceeds to the firm from the sale of each 
bond are therefore $960 ($980 minus $20).
BEFORE-TAx COST OF dEBT
The before-tax cost of debt, rd
, is simply the rate of return the firm must pay on 
new borrowing. A firm’s before-tax cost of debt for bonds can be found in any of 
three ways: quotation, calculation, or approximation.
using Market Quotations
A relatively quick method for finding the before-tax cost of debt is to observe the 
yield to maturity (YTM) on the firm’s existing bonds or bonds of similar risk issued 
by other companies. The YTM of existing bonds reflects the rate of return required 
by the market. For example, if the market requires a YTM of 9.7 percent for a 
similar-risk bond, this value can be used as the before-tax cost of debt, rd
, for new 
bonds. Bond yields are widely reported by sources such as the Wall Street Journal.
Calculating the Cost
This approach finds the before-tax cost of debt by calculating the YTM generated 
by the bond’s cash flows, given the net proceeds that the firm receives when it 
issues the bonds. From the issuer’s point of view, this value is the cost to maturity
of the cash flows associated with the debt. The YTM can be calculated by using a 
financial calculator or an electronic spreadsheet. It represents the annual before￾tax percentage cost of the debt.
In the preceding example, $960 were the net proceeds of a 20-year bond with a 
$1,000 par value and 9% coupon interest rate. The calculation of the annual cost

flotation costs
The total costs of issuing and 
selling a security.414 PART 4   Risk and the Required Rate of Return
is quite simple. The cash flow pattern associated with this bond’s sales consists of 
an initial inflow (the net proceeds) followed by a series of annual outlays (the in￾terest payments). In the final year, when the debt is retired, an outlay representing 
the repayment of the principal also occurs. The cash flows associated with Duch￾ess Corporation’s bond issue are as follows:
End of year(s) Cash flow
0 $ 960
1–20 2$ 90
20 2$1,000
The initial $960 inflow is followed by annual interest outflows of $90 
(9% coupon interest rate * $1,000 par value) over the 20-year life of the 
bond. In year 20, an outflow of $1,000 (the repayment of the principal) oc￾curs. We can determine the cost of debt by finding the YTM, which is the 
discount rate that equates the present value of the bond outflows to the initial 
inflow.
Calculator use (Note: Most calculators require either the present value [net pro￾ceeds] or the future value [annual interest payments and repayment of principal] 
to be input as negative numbers when we calculate yield to maturity. That ap￾proach is used here.) Using the calculator and the inputs shown at the left, you 
should find the before-tax cost of debt (yield to maturity) to be 9.452%.
Spreadsheet use The before-tax cost of debt on the Duchess Corporation 
bond can be calculated using an Excel spreadsheet. The following Excel 
spreadsheet shows that by referencing the cells containing the bond’s net 
proceeds, coupon payment, years to maturity, and par value as part of Excel’s 
RATE function, you can quickly determine that the appropriate before-tax 
cost of debt for Duchess Corporation’s bond is 9.452%.

$980 = 0.09388 or 9.388,
This approximate value of before-tax cost of debt is close to the 9.452%, but it 
lacks the precision of the value derived using the calculator or spreadsheet.
AFTER-TAx COST OF dEBT
Unlike the dividends paid to equityholders, the interest payments paid to bond￾holders are tax deductable for the firm, so the interest expense on debt reduces 
the firm’s taxable income and, therefore, the firm’s tax liability. To find the firm’s 
net cost of debt, we must account for the tax savings created by debt and solve 
for the cost of long-term debt on an after-tax basis. The after-tax cost of debt, ri
, 
can be found by multiplying the before-tax cost, rd
, by 1 minus the tax rate, T:

(9.1)
Approximating the Cost
Although not as precise as using a calculator, there is a method for quickly ap￾proximating the before-tax cost of debt. The before-tax cost of debt, rd
, for a 
bond with a $1,000 par value can be approximated by
ri = rd * (1 - T) (9.2)
Duchess Corporation has a 40% tax rate. Using the 9.452% before-tax debt cost 
calculated above and applying Equation 9.2, we find an after-tax cost of debt of 
5.67,39.452, * (1 - 0.40) 4 . Typically, the cost of long-term debt for a given 
firm is less than the cost of preferred or common stock, partly because of the tax 
deductibility of interest.

the auto dealer at an annual interest rate of 6.0%, or they can take a $60,000 sec￾ond mortgage on their home. The best annual rate they can get on the second mort￾gage is 7.2%. They already have qualified for both of the loans being considered.
If they borrow from the auto dealer, the interest on this “consumer loan” 
will not be deductible for federal tax purposes. However, the interest on the sec￾ond mortgage would be tax deductible because the tax law allows individuals to 
deduct interest paid on a home mortgage. To choose the least-cost financing, the 
Sullivans calculated the after-tax cost of both sources of long-term debt. Because 
interest on the auto loan is not tax deductible, its after-tax cost equals its stated 
cost of 6.0%. Because the interest on the second mortgage is tax deductible, its 
after-tax cost can be found using Equation 9.2:
 After@tax cost of debt = Before@tax cost of debt * (1 - Tax rate)
 7.2, * (1 - 0.28) = 7.2, * 0.72 = 5.2,
Because the 5.2% after-tax cost of the second mortgage is less than the 6.0% cost 
of the auto loan, the Sullivans may decide to use the second mortgage to finance 
the auto purchase.

9.3 Cost of Preferred Stock
Preferred stock represents a special type of ownership interest in the firm. It gives 
preferred stockholders the right to receive their stated dividends before the firm 
can distribute any earnings to common stockholders. The key characteristics of 
preferred stock were described in Chapter 7. However, the one aspect of pre￾ferred stock that requires review is dividends.
PREFERREd STOCK dIVIdENdS
When dividends are stated as “preferred stock dividends,” the stock is often referred 
to as “x-dollar preferred stock.” Thus, a “$4 preferred stock” is expected to pay pre￾ferred stockholders $4 in dividends each year on each share of preferred stock owned.
Sometimes preferred stock dividends are stated as an annual percentage rate.
This rate represents the percentage of the stock’s par, or face, value that equals

the annual dividend. For instance, an 8 percent preferred stock with a $50 par 
value would be expected to pay an annual dividend of $4 per share 
(0.08 * $50 par = $4). Before the cost of preferred stock is calculated, any divi￾dends stated as percentages should be converted to annual dollar dividends.
CALCuLATING ThE COST OF PREFERREd STOCK
The cost of preferred stock, rp
, is the ratio of the preferred stock dividend to the 
firm’s net proceeds from the sale of the preferred stock. The net proceeds repre￾sent the amount of money to be received minus any flotation costs. The following 
equation gives the cost of preferred stock, rp

Duchess Corporation is contemplating issuance of a 10% preferred stock that 
they expect to sell for $87 per share. The cost of issuing and selling the stock will 
be $5 per share. The first step in finding the cost of the stock is to calculate the 
dollar amount of the annual preferred dividend, which is $8.70 (0.10 * $87). 
The net proceeds per share from the proposed sale of stock equals the sale price 
minus the flotation costs ($87 - $5 = $82). Substituting the annual dividend, 
Dp
, of $8.70 and the net proceeds, Np
, of $82 into Equation 9.3 gives the cost of 
preferred stock, 10.6, ($8.70 , $82).
The cost of Duchess’s preferred stock (10.6%) is much greater than the cost of 
its long-term debt (5.67%). This difference exists both because the cost of long￾term debt (the interest) is tax deductible and because preferred stock is riskier than 
long-term debt.

9.4 Cost of Common Stock
The cost of common stock is the return required on the stock by investors in the 
marketplace. There are two forms of common stock financing: (1) retained earn￾ings and (2) new issues of common stock. As a first step in finding each of these 
costs, we must estimate the cost of common stock equity.
FINdING ThE COST OF COMMON STOCK EQuITY
The cost of common stock equity, rs
, is the rate at which investors discount the ex￾pected common stock dividends of the firm to determine its share value. Two tech￾niques are used to measure the cost of common stock equity. One relies on the con￾stant-growth valuation model, the other on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).
Example 9.7 ▶

using the Constant-Growth Valuation (Gordon Growth) Model
In Chapter 7, we found the value of a share of stock to be equal to the present 
value of all future dividends, which in one model are assumed to grow at a con￾stant annual rate over an infinite time horizon. This model, the constant-growth 
valuation model, is also known as the Gordon growth model. The key expression 
derived for this model, first presented as Equation 7.4, is
constant-growth valuation 
(Gordon growth) model
Assumes that the value of a 
share of stock equals the 
present value of all future 
dividends (assumed to grow at 
a constant rate) that it is 
expected to provide over an 
infinite time horizon.
P0 =
D1
rs - g
(9.4)
where
P0 = value of common stock
D1 = per@share dividend expected at the end of year 1
rs = required return on common stock
g = constant rate of growth in dividends
Solving Equation 9.4 for rs
 results in the following expression for the cost of
common stock equity:
rs =
D1
P0
+ g (9.5)
Equation 9.5 indicates that the cost of common stock equity can be found by dividing 
the dividend expected at the end of year 1 by the current market price of the stock (the 
“dividend yield”) and adding the expected growth rate (the “capital gains yield”).
Duchess Corporation wishes to determine its cost of common stock equity, rs
. The 
market price, P0
, of its common stock is $50 per share. The firm expects to pay a 
dividend, D1
, of $4 at the end of the coming year, 2016. The dividends paid on the 
outstanding stock over the past 6 years (2010 through 2015) were as follows:
Example 9.8 ▶
Year Dividend
2015 $3.80
2014 3.62
2013 3.47
2012 3.33
2011 3.12
2010 2.97
Using a financial calculator or electronic spreadsheet, in conjunction with the 
technique described for finding growth rates in Chapter 5, we can calculate 
the annual rate at which dividends have grown, g, from 2010 to 2015. It turns 
out to be approximately 5% (more precisely, it is 5.05%). Substituting 
D1 = $4, P0 = $50, and g = 5, into Equation 9.5 yields the cost of common 
stock equity:
rs =

$50 + 0.05 = 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.130 or 13.0,ChAPTER 9   The Cost of Capital 419
The 13.0% cost of common stock equity represents the return required by exist￾ing shareholders on their investment. If the actual return is less than that, share￾holders are likely to begin selling their stock.
using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
Recall from Chapter 8 that the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) describes the 
relationship between the required return, rs
, and the nondiversifiable risk of the 
firm as measured by the beta coefficient, b. The basic CAPM is
capital asset pricing model 
(CAPM)
Describes the relationship 
between the required return, rs
, 
and the nondiversifiable risk of 
the firm as measured by the 
beta coefficient, b.
rs = RF + 3b * (rm - RF
) 4 (9.6)
where
RF = risk@free rate of return
rm = market return; return on the market portfolio of assets
Using the CAPM indicates that the cost of common stock equity is the return required 
by investors as compensation for the firm’s nondiversifiable risk, measured by beta.
Duchess Corporation now wishes to calculate its cost of common stock equity, rs
, 
by using the CAPM. The firm’s investment advisors and its own analysts indicate 
that the risk-free rate, RF
, equals 7%; the firm’s beta, b, equals 1.5; and the mar￾ket return, rm, equals 11%. Substituting these values into Equation 9.6, the com￾pany estimates the cost of common stock equity, rs
, to be
rs = 7.0, + 31.5 * (11.0, - 7.0,)4 = 7.0, + 6.0, = 13.0,
The 13.0% cost of common stock equity represents the required return of inves￾tors in Duchess Corporation common stock. It is the same as that found by using 
the constant-growth valuation model.
Comparing Constant-Growth and CAPM Techniques
The CAPM technique differs from the constant-growth valuation model in that it 
directly considers the firm’s risk, as reflected by beta, in determining the required
return or cost of common stock equity. The constant-growth model does not 
look at risk; it uses the market price, P0
, as a reflection of the expected risk–
return preference of investors in the marketplace. The constant-growth valuation 
and CAPM techniques for finding rs
 are theoretically equivalent, although in 
practice estimates from the two methods do not always agree. The two methods 
can produce different estimates because they require (as inputs) estimates of other 
quantities, such as the expected dividend growth rate or the firm’s beta.
Another difference is that when the constant-growth valuation model is used 
to find the cost of common stock equity, it can easily be adjusted for flotation costs 
to find the cost of new common stock; the CAPM does not provide a simple adjust￾ment mechanism. The difficulty in adjusting the cost of common stock equity cal￾culated by using the CAPM occurs because in its common form the model does not 
include the market price, P0
, a variable needed to make such an adjustment. Al￾though the CAPM has a stronger theoretical foundation, the computational appeal 
of the traditional constant-growth valuation model justifies its use throughout this 
text to measure financing costs of common stock. As a practical matter, analysts

COST OF NEW ISSuES OF COMMON STOCK
Our purpose in finding the firm’s overall cost of capital is to determine the after-tax 
cost of new funds required for financing projects. The cost of a new issue of common 
stock, rn, is determined by calculating the cost of common stock, net of underpricing 
and associated flotation costs. Normally, when new shares are issued, they are under￾priced, meaning that they are sold at a discount relative to the current market price, 
P0
. Underpricing is the difference between the market price and the issue price, which 
is the price paid by the primary market investors discussed in Chapter 2.
might want to estimate the cost of equity using both approaches and then take an 
average of the results to arrive at a final estimate of the cost of equity.
COST OF RETAINEd EARNINGS
As you know, dividends are paid out of a firm’s earnings. Their payment, made 
in cash to common stockholders, reduces the firm’s retained earnings. Suppose 
that a firm needs common stock equity financing of a certain amount. It has two 
choices relative to retained earnings: It can issue additional common stock in that 
amount and still pay dividends to stockholders out of retained earnings, or it can 
increase common stock equity by retaining the earnings (not paying the cash div￾idends) in the needed amount. In a strict accounting sense, the retention of earn￾ings increases common stock equity in the same way that the sale of additional 
shares of common stock does. Thus, the cost of retained earnings, rr
, to the firm 
is the same as the cost of an equivalent fully subscribed issue of additional com￾mon stock. Stockholders find the firm’s retention of earnings acceptable only if 
they expect that it will earn at least their required return on the reinvested funds.
Viewing retained earnings as a fully subscribed issue of additional common 
stock, we can set the firm’s cost of retained earnings, rr
, equal to the cost of com￾mon stock equity as given by Equations 9.5 and 9.6. 
cost of retained earnings, rr
The same as the cost of an 
equivalent fully subscribed 
issue of additional common 
stock, which is equal to the cost 
of common stock equity, rs
.
rr = rs
(9.7)
Thus, it is not necessary to adjust the cost of retained earnings for flotation costs 
because by retaining earnings the firm “raises” equity capital without incurring 
these costs.
The cost of retained earnings for Duchess Corporation was actually calculated in the 
preceding examples: It is equal to the cost of common stock equity. Thus, rr
 equals 
13.0%. As we will show in the next section, the cost of retained earnings is always 
lower than the cost of a new issue of common stock because it entails no flotation costs.
Example 9.10 ▶
Matter of fact
I
n the United States and most other countries, firms rely more heavily on retained earnings than any 
other financing source. For example, a 2013 survey of Chinese firms found that 64% of the compa￾nies surveyed listed retained earnings as one of their primary sources of funds. Bank loans were a 
distant second choice, mentioned as a primary source of funds by just 44% of the companies.1

We can use the constant-growth valuation model expression for the cost of 
existing common stock, rs
, as a starting point. If we let Nn
 represent the net pro￾ceeds from the sale of new common stock after subtracting underpricing and 
flotation costs, the cost of the new issue, rn
, can be expressed as2
2. An alternative, but computationally less straightforward, form of this equation is
 rn =
D1
P0 * (1 - f )
+ g (9.8a)
where f represents the percentage reduction in current market price expected as a result of underpricing and flotation 
costs. Simply stated, Nn
 in Equation 9.8 is equivalent to p0 * (1 - f) in Equation 9.8a. For convenience, Equation 
9.8 is used to define the cost of a new issue of common stock, rn
.
The net proceeds from sale of new common stock, Nn
, will be less than the 
current market price, P0
. Therefore, the cost of new issues, rn
, will always be 
greater than the cost of existing issues, rs
, which is equal to the cost of retained 
earnings, rr
. The cost of new common stock is normally greater than any other 
long-term financing cost.
In the constant-growth valuation example, we found Duchess Corporation’s cost 
of common stock equity, rs
, to be 13%, using the following values: an expected 
dividend, D1
, of $4; a current market price, P0
, of $50; and an expected growth 
rate of dividends, g, of 5%.
To determine its cost of new common stock, rn
, Duchess Corporation has esti￾mated that on average, new shares can be sold for $47. The $3-per-share underpricing 
is due to the competitive nature of the market. A second cost associated with a new 
issue is flotation costs of $2.50 per share that would be paid to issue and sell the new 
shares. The total underpricing and flotation costs per share are therefore $5.50.
Subtracting the $5.50-per-share underpricing and flotation cost from the current 
$50 share price results in expected net proceeds of $44.50 per share ($50.00 minus 
$5.50). Substituting D1 = $4, Nn = $44.50, and g = 5, into Equation 9.8 results 
in a cost of new common stock, rn
:
rn =
$4.00
$44.50 + 0.05 = 0.09 + 0.05 = 0.140 or 14.0,
Duchess Corporation’s cost of new common stock is therefore 14.0%. That is the 
value to be used in subsequent calculations of the firm’s overall cost of capital.

9.5 Weighted Average Cost of Capital
As noted earlier, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), ra
, reflects the ex￾pected average future cost of capital over the long run. It is found by weighting the 
cost of each specific type of capital by its proportion in the firm’s capital structure.
CALCuLATING WEIGhTEd AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL (WACC)
Calculating the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is straightforward: 
Multiply the individual cost of each form of financing by its proportion in the 
firm’s capital structure and sum the weighted values. As an equation, the weighted 
average cost of capital, ra
, can be specified as
weighted average cost of 
capital (WACC), ra
Reflects the expected average 
future cost of capital over the 
long run; found by weighting 
the cost of each specific type of 
capital by its proportion in the 
firm’s capital structure.
ra = (wi * ri
) + (wp * rp
) + (ws * rr or n
) (9.9)
where
wi = proportion of long@term debt in capital structure
wp = proportion of preferred stock in capital structure
ws = proportion of common stock equity in capital structure
wi + wp + ws = 1.0
Three important points should be noted in Equation 9.9:
 1. For computational convenience, it is best to convert the weights into decimal 
form and leave the individual costs in percentage terms.
 2. The weights must be nonnegative and sum to 1.0. Simply stated, WACC 
must account for all financing costs within the firm’s capital structure.
 3. The firm’s common stock equity weight, ws
, is multiplied by either the cost of 
retained earnings, rr
, or the cost of new common stock, rn
. Which cost is used 
depends on whether the firm’s common stock equity will be financed using 
retained earnings, rr
, or new common stock, rn
.
In earlier examples, we found the costs of the various types of capital for Duchess 
Corporation to be as follows:
 Cost of debt, ri = 5.6,
 Cost of preferred stock, rp = 10.6,
 Cost of retained earnings, rr = 13.0,
 Cost of new common stock, rn = 14.0,
The company uses the following weights in calculating its weighted average cost 
of capital:

Because the firm expects to have a sizable amount of retained earnings avail￾able ($300,000), it plans to use its cost of retained earnings, rr
, as the cost of 
common stock equity. Duchess Corporation’s weighted average cost of capital is 
calculated in Table 9.1. The resulting weighted average cost of capital for Duch￾ess is 9.8%. Assuming an unchanged risk level, the firm should accept all projects 
that will earn a return greater than 9.8%.

As U.S. financial mar￾kets experienced and 
recovered from the 2008 financial crisis 
and 2009 “great recession,” firms strug￾gled to keep track of their weighted aver￾age cost of capital. The individual com￾ponent costs were moving rapidly in 
response to the financial market turmoil. 
Volatile financial markets can make oth￾erwise manageable cost-of-capital calcu￾lations exceedingly complex and inher￾ently error prone, possibly wreaking 
havoc with investment decisions. If a firm 
underestimates its cost of capital, it risks 
making investments that are not economi￾cally justified, and if a firm overestimates 
its financing costs, it risks foregoing 
value-maximizing investments.
Although the WACC computation 
does not change when markets become 
unstable, the uncertainty surrounding the 
components that comprise the WACC 
increases dramatically. The financial cri￾sis pushed credit costs to a point where 
focus on PRACTICE
the reality is that the longer-term cost is so 
high that it has forced us to focus only on 
those projects that have immediate 
returns,” Mr. Domanico is quoted saying.a
Part of Caraustar’s motivation for 
implementing this two-pronged approach 
was to account for the excessively large 
spread between short- and long-term 
debt rates that emerged during the finan￾cial market crisis. Mr. Domanico 
reported that during the crisis Caraustar 
could borrow short-term funds at the 
lower of Prime plus 4 percent or LIBOR 
plus 5 percent, where either rate was 
reasonable for making short-term invest￾ment decisions. Alternatively, long-term 
investment decisions were being 
required to clear Caraustar’s long-term 
cost-of-capital calculation accounting for 
borrowing rates in excess of 12 percent.
▶ Why don’t firms generally use 
both short- and long-run weighted 
average costs of capital?
long-term debt was largely inaccessible, 
and the great recession saw Treasury 
bond yields fall to historic lows, making 
cost of equity projections appear unrea￾sonably low. With these key compo￾nents in flux, it is exceedingly difficult, if 
not impossible, for firms to get a handle 
on a cost of long-term capital.
According to CFO Magazine, at 
least one firm resorted to a two-pronged 
approach for determining its cost of capi￾tal during the uncertain times. Ron 
Domanico is the chief financial officer 
(CFO) at Caraustar Industries, Inc., and 
he reported that his company dealt with 
the cost-of-capital uncertainty by abandon￾ing the conventional one-size-fits-all 
approach. “In the past, we had one cost 
of capital that we applied to all our invest￾ment decisions . . . today that’s not the 
case. We have a short-term cost of capi￾tal we apply to short-term opportunities, 
and a longer-term cost of capital we

Uncertain Times Make for an Uncertain Weighted Average Cost of Capital424 PART 4   Risk and the Required Rate of Return
WEIGhTING SChEMES
Firms can calculate weights on the basis of either book value or market value us￾ing either historical or target proportions.
Book Value versus Market Value
Book value weights use accounting values to measure the proportion of each type of 
capital in the firm’s financial structure. Market value weights measure the propor￾tion of each type of capital at its market value. Market value weights are appealing 
because the market values of securities closely approximate the actual dollars to be 
received from their sale. Moreover, because firms calculate the costs of the various 
types of capital by using prevailing market prices, it seems reasonable to use market 
value weights. In addition, the long-term investment cash flows to which the cost of 
capital is applied are estimated in terms of current as well as future market values. 
Market value weights are clearly preferred over book value weights.
historical versus Target Weights
Historical weights can be either book or market value weights based on actual
capital structure proportions. For example, past or current book value propor￾tions would constitute a form of historical weighting, as would past or current 
market value proportions. Such a weighting scheme would therefore be based on 
real—rather than desired—proportions.
Target weights, which can also be based on either book or market values, 
reflect the firm’s desired capital structure proportions. Firms using target weights 
establish such proportions on the basis of the “optimal” capital structure they 
wish to achieve. (The development of these proportions and the optimal structure 
are discussed in detail in Chapter 13.)
When one considers the somewhat approximate nature of the calculation of 
weighted average cost of capital, the choice of weights may not be critical. However, 
from a strictly theoretical point of view, the preferred weighting scheme is target mar￾ket value proportions, and we assume this scheme throughout this chapter.

Chuck wishes to choose the least costly alternative: (1) to do nothing or (2) to bor￾row the $80,000 and pay off all three loans. He calculates the weighted average cost of 
his current debt by weighting each debt’s annual interest cost by the proportion of the 
$80,000 total it represents and then summing the three weighted values as follows:
Weighted average
 cost of current debt = 3($26,000 , $80,000) * 9.6,4 + 3($9,000 , $80,000)
 * 10.6,4 + 3 ($45,000 , $80,000) * 7.4,4

= 3.12, + 1.19, + 4.16, = 8.47, ≈ 8.5,
Given that the weighted average cost of the $80,000 of current debt of 8.5% is 
below the 9.2% cost of the new $80,000 loan, Chuck should do nothing and just 
continue to pay off the three loans as originally scheduled.

Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
The cost of capital is an extremely important rate of return, particularly in capi￾tal budgeting decisions. It is the expected average future cost to the firm of 
funds over the long run. Because the cost of capital is the pivotal rate of return 
used in the investment decision process, its accuracy can significantly affect the 
quality of these decisions.
Underestimation of the cost of capital can make poor projects look attractive; 
overestimation can make good projects look unattractive. By applying the tech￾niques presented in this chapter to estimate the firm’s cost of capital, the financial

cost of capital. The cost of capital is the minimum rate of return that a firm 
must earn on its investments to grow firm value. A weighted average cost of 
capital should be used to find the expected average future cost of funds over 426 PART 4   Risk and the Required Rate of Return
the long run. The individual costs of the basic sources of capital (long-term 
debt, preferred stock, retained earnings, and common stock) can be calculated 
separately.
LG 2 Explain what is meant by the marginal cost of capital. The relevant cost 
of capital for a firm is the marginal cost of capital necessary to raise the next 
marginal dollar of financing to fund the firm’s future investment opportunities. 
A firm’s future investment opportunities in expectation will be required to ex￾ceed the firm’s cost of capital.
LG 3 Determine the cost of long-term debt, and explain why the after-tax cost 
of debt is the relevant cost of debt. The before-tax cost of long-term debt can be 
found by using cost quotations, calculations (either by calculator or spread￾sheet), or an approximation. The after-tax cost of debt is calculated by multiply￾ing the before-tax cost of debt by 1 minus the tax rate. The after-tax cost of debt 
is the relevant cost of debt because it is the lowest possible cost of debt for the 
firm due to the deductibility of interest expenses.
LG 4 Determine the cost of preferred stock. The cost of preferred stock is the 
ratio of the preferred stock dividend to the firm’s net proceeds from the sale of 
preferred stock.
LG 5 Calculate the cost of common stock equity, and convert it into the cost of 
retained earnings and the cost of new issues of common stock. The cost of com￾mon stock equity can be calculated by using the constant-growth valuation 
(Gordon growth) model or the CAPM. The cost of retained earnings is equal to 
the cost of common stock equity. An adjustment in the cost of common stock 
equity to reflect underpricing and flotation costs is necessary to find the cost of 
new issues of common stock.
LG 6 Calculate the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and discuss alter￾native weighting schemes. The firm’s WACC reflects the expected average future 
cost of funds over the long run. It combines the costs of specific types of capital 
after weighting each of them by its proportion. The theoretically preferred ap￾proach uses target weights based on market values.
Opener-in-Review
In the chapter opener you learned that Alcoa’s weighted average cost of 
capital was around 12 percent, but its investments were earning returns closer 
to 5 percent. From 2010 to 2012, Alcoa invested roughly $1 billion in capital 
expenditures. Suppose Alcoa spends $1 billion expanding its manufacturing 
facilities today, and that investment produces a net cash flow of $50 million (5 
percent of $1 billion) every year in perpetuity. Calculate the NPV of that 
investment using a 12 percent discount rate. How much value does the $1 
billion investment create or destroy? Does it seem that Alcoa should be 
pursuing growth in this market?ChAPTER 9   The Cost of Capital 427

 ST9–1 Individual costs and WACC Humble Manufacturing is interested in measuring its 
overall cost of capital. The firm is in the 40% tax bracket. Current investigation has 
gathered the following data:
 Debt The firm can raise debt by selling $1,000-par-value, 10% coupon interest 
rate, 10-year bonds on which annual interest payments will be made. To sell the 
issue, an average discount of $30 per bond must be given. The firm must also 
pay flotation costs of $20 per bond.
 Preferred stock The firm can sell 11% (annual dividend) preferred stock at its 
$100-per-share par value. The cost of issuing and selling the preferred stock is 
expected to be $4 per share.
 Common stock The firm’s common stock is currently selling for $80 per share. 
The firm expects to pay cash dividends of $6 per share next year. The firm’s divi￾dends have been growing at an annual rate of 6%, and this rate is expected to 
continue in the future. The stock will have to be underpriced by $4 per share, 
and flotation costs are expected to amount to $4 per share.
 Retained earnings The firm expects to have $225,000 of retained earnings avail￾able in the coming year. Once these retained earnings are exhausted, the firm will 
use new common stock as the form of common stock equity financing.

LG 6
LG 1436 PART 4   Risk and the Required Rate of Return
The tax rate of the firm is currently 40%. The needed financial information and 
data are as follows:
Debt Nova can raise debt by selling $1,000-par-value, 6.5% coupon interest 
rate, 10-year bonds on which annual interest payments will be made. To sell the 
issue, an average discount of $20 per bond needs to be given. There is an associ￾ated flotation cost of 2% of par value.
Preferred stock Preferred stock can be sold under the following terms: The secu￾rity has a par value of $100 per share, the annual dividend rate is 6% of the par 
value, and the flotation cost is expected to be $4 per share. The preferred stock is 
expected to sell for $102 before cost considerations.
Common stock The current price of Nova’s common stock is $35 per share. 
The cash dividend is expected to be $3.25 per share next year. The firm’s 
dividends have grown at an annual rate of 5%, and it is expected that the 
dividend will continue at this rate for the foreseeable future. The flotation 
costs are expected to be approximately $2 per share. Nova can sell new common 
stock under these terms.
Retained earnings The firm expects to have available $100,000 of retained earn￾ings in the coming year. Once these retained earnings are exhausted, the firm will 
use new common stock as the form of common stock equity financing. (Note:
When measuring this cost, the firm does not concern itself with the tax bracket or

At the present time, Eco can raise debt by selling 20-year bonds with a $1,000 
par value and a 10.5% annual coupon interest rate. Eco’s corporate tax rate is 
40%, and its bonds generally require an average discount of $45 per bond and 
flotation costs of $32 per bond when being sold. Eco’s outstanding preferred stock 
pays a 9% dividend and has a $95-per-share par value. The cost of issuing and 
selling additional preferred stock is expected to be $7 per share. Because Eco is a 
young firm that requires lots of cash to grow it does not currently pay a dividend 
to common stockholders. To track the cost of common stock the CFO uses the 
capital asset pricing model (CAPM). The CFO and the firm’s investment advisors 
believe that the appropriate risk-free rate is 4% and that the market’s expected 
return equals 13%. Using data from 2012 through 2015, Eco’s CFO estimates the 
firm’s beta to be 1.3.
Although Eco’s current target capital structure includes 20% preferred stock, 
the company is considering using debt financing to retire the outstanding preferred 
stock, thus shifting their target capital structure to 50% long-term debt and 50% 
common stock. If Eco shifts its capital mix from preferred stock to debt, its financial 
advisors expect its beta to increase to 1.5.

robably nothing that financial managers do is more important to the long-term 
success of a company than making good investment decisions. The term 
capital budgeting describes the process for evaluating and selecting investment 
projects. Often, capital expenditures can be very large, such as building a new 
plant or launching a new product line. These endeavors can create enormous 
value for shareholders, but they can also bankrupt the company. In this part, you’ll 
learn how financial managers decide which investment opportunities to pursue.
Chapter 10 covers the capital budgeting tools that financial managers and ana￾lysts use to evaluate the merits of an investment. Some of these techniques are 
quite intuitive and simple to use, such as payback analysis. Other techniques are 
a little more complex, such as the net present value and internal rate of return ap￾proaches. In general, the more complex techniques provide more comprehensive 
evaluations, but the simpler approaches often lead to the same value-maximizing 
decisions.
Chapter 11 illustrates how to develop the capital budgeting cash flows that the 
techniques covered in Chapter 10 require. After studying this chapter, you will 
understand the inputs that are necessary to build the relevant cash flows that are 
required to determine whether a particular investment is likely to create or destroy 
value for shareholders.
Chapter 12 introduces additional techniques for evaluating the risks inherent with 
capital investment projects. Because of the often huge scale of capital investments 
and their importance to the firm’s financial well-being, managers invest a tremen￾dous amount of time and energy trying to understand the risks associated with 
these projects.

Capital Budgeting Techniques 
Work at Treats
“Come to Treats for Waffles and More” is the 
attractive slogan of a small dessert shop in 
Cairo, Egypt. With waffles and pancakes being their 
favorite desserts, Shamel and Shehab El-Sherei always 
dreamed of having their own business so others could 
enjoy them as well. Since they were still at university, 
Shamel and Shehab thought this plan would have to be 
postponed until they had enough experience and knowledge to open their own business without 
the risk of losing all their savings. However, after an introductory course in managerial finance, the 
pair started applying the theories of capital budgeting to their project.
Having learned that the first step for any project assessment is to look at the cash flow, they 
studied the costs of buying the necessary equipment and renting a location, and considered other 
expenses of starting the business. They estimated they would need 100,000 EGP of initial invest￾ment and 12,500 EGP each month to cover expenses. The revenues from selling the desserts were 
estimated to be 25 EGP on average per item, with a total of 100 sold per day. This equaled a net 
cash inflow of 30,000 EGP in the first year, which they estimated would rise by 15% per year for 
the following 3 years. 
Using these data, they calculated the profitability of their idea using net present value and in￾ternal rate of return; both figures turned out to be quite promising. The net present value of the cash 
flow was 16,757 EGP at a cost of capital of 10%, for an internal rate of return of 17%. 
Shamel and Shehab also wanted to know how long it would take for them to regain their invest￾ment in the business. They calculated the payback period, which was lower than they expected and, 
therefore, a positive indicator. Based on all of these results, Shamel and Shehab were convinced their 
idea was not merely a dream but a realistic, profitable business model, and they decided to start their 
project without further delay. 
A year after its opening, Treats—Waffles and More is considered one of the top dessert 
places in Cairo, and is ranked fourth in the well-known local magazine, G-mag. 
Payback, internal rate of return, and net present value are all methods that companies use to 
evaluate potential investment projects. Each of these techniques has advantages and disadvantages, 
but the net present value method has become the gold standard for analyzing investments. This 
chapter explains why.

 10.1 Overview of Capital Budgeting
Long-term investments represent sizable outlays of funds that commit a firm to 
some course of action. Consequently, the firm needs procedures to analyze and 
select its long-term investments. Capital budgeting is the process of evaluating 
and selecting long-term investments that are consistent with the firm’s goal of 
maximizing owners’ wealth. Firms typically make a variety of long-term invest￾ments, but the most common is in fixed assets, which include property (land), 
plant, and equipment. These assets, often referred to as earning assets, generally 
provide the basis for the firm’s earning power and value.
Because firms treat capital budgeting (investment) and financing decisions 
separately, Chapters 10 through 12 concentrate on fixed-asset acquisition with￾out regard to the specific method of financing used. We begin by discussing the 
motives for capital expenditure.
MOTIVES FOR CAPITAL ExPENdITuRE
A capital expenditure is an outlay of funds by the firm that is expected to produce 
benefits over a period of time greater than 1 year. An operating expenditure is an 
outlay resulting in benefits received within 1 year. Fixed-asset outlays are capital 
expenditures, but not all capital expenditures are classified as fixed assets. A 
$60,000 outlay for a new machine with a usable life of 15 years is a capital ex￾penditure that would appear as a fixed asset on the firm’s balance sheet. A 
$60,000 outlay for an advertising campaign that is expected to produce benefits 
over a long period is also a capital expenditure, but it would rarely be shown as a 
fixed asset.
Companies make capital expenditures for many reasons. The primary mo￾tives for capital expenditures are to expand operations, to replace or renew fixed 
assets, and to obtain some other, less tangible benefit over a long period.
STEPS IN ThE PROCESS
The capital budgeting process consists of five distinct but interrelated steps:
 1. Proposal generation. Proposals for new investment projects are made at all 
levels within a business organization and are reviewed by finance personnel. 
Proposals that require large outlays are more carefully scrutinized than less 
costly ones.
 2. Review and analysis. Financial managers perform formal review and analysis 
to assess the merits of investment proposals.
 3. Decision making. Firms typically delegate capital expenditure decision mak￾ing on the basis of dollar limits. Generally, the board of directors must au￾thorize expenditures beyond a certain amount. Often, plant managers are 
given authority to make decisions necessary to keep the production line 
moving.
 4. Implementation. Following approval, expenditures are made and projects 
implemented. Expenditures for a large project often occur in phases.
 5. Follow-up. Results are monitored, and actual costs and benefits are compared 
with those that were expected. Action may be required if actual outcomes 
differ from projected ones.

Each step in the process is important. Review and analysis and decision mak￾ing (Steps 2 and 3) consume the majority of time and effort, however. Follow-up 
(Step 5) is an important but often ignored step aimed at allowing the firm to im￾prove the accuracy of its cash flow estimates continuously. Because of their fun￾damental importance, this and the following chapters give primary consideration 
to review and analysis and to decision making.
BASIC TERMINOLOGY
Before we develop the concepts, techniques, and practices related to the capital 
budgeting process, we need to explain some basic terminology. In addition, we 
will present some key assumptions that are used to simplify the discussion in the 
remainder of this chapter and in Chapters 11 and 12.
Independent versus Mutually Exclusive Projects
Most investments can be placed into one of two categories: (1) independent pro￾jects or (2) mutually exclusive projects. Independent projects are those with cash 
flows that are unrelated to (or independent of) one another; the acceptance of one 
project does not eliminate the others from further consideration. Mutually exclu￾sive projects are those that have the same function and therefore compete with one 
another. The acceptance of one eliminates from further consideration all other 
projects that serve a similar function. For example, a firm in need of increased 
production capacity could obtain it by (1) expanding its plant, (2) acquiring an￾other company, or (3) contracting with another company for production. Clearly, 
accepting any one option eliminates the immediate need for either of the others.
unlimited Funds versus Capital Rationing
The availability of funds for capital expenditures affects the firm’s decisions. If a 
firm has unlimited funds for investment (or if it can raise as much money as it 
needs by borrowing or issuing stock), making capital budgeting decisions is quite 
simple: All independent projects that will provide an acceptable return can be ac￾cepted. Often, though, firms operate under capital rationing instead, which 
means that they have a fixed budget available for capital expenditures and that 
numerous projects will compete for these dollars. Procedures for dealing with 
capital rationing are presented in Chapter 12. The discussions here and in Chap￾ter 12 assume unlimited funds.
Accept–Reject versus Ranking Approaches
Two standard approaches to capital budgeting decisions are available. The 
accept–reject approach involves evaluating capital expenditure proposals to de￾termine whether they meet the firm’s minimum acceptance criterion. This ap￾proach can be used when the firm has unlimited funds, as a preliminary step 
when evaluating mutually exclusive projects, or in a situation in which capital 
must be rationed. In these cases, only acceptable projects should be considered.
The second method, the ranking approach, involves ranking projects on the 
basis of some predetermined measure, such as the rate of return. The project with 
the highest return is ranked first, and the project with the lowest return is ranked 
last. Only acceptable projects should be ranked. Ranking is useful in selecting the 
“best” of a group of mutually exclusive projects and in evaluating projects with a 
view of capital rationing.
independent projects 
Projects whose cash flows are 
unrelated to (or independent 
of) one another; the 
acceptance of one does not 
eliminate the others from 
further consideration.
mutually exclusive projects 
Projects that compete with one 
another so that the acceptance 
of one eliminates from further 
consideration all other projects 
that serve a similar function.

The financial situation in which 
a firm is able to accept all 
independent projects that

expenditures and numerous 
projects compete for these dollars.

CAPITAL BudGETING TEChNIQuES
Large firms evaluate dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of different ideas for new 
investments each year. To ensure that the investment projects selected have the 
best chance of increasing the value of the firm, financial managers need tools to 
help them evaluate the merits of individual projects and to rank competing in￾vestments. A number of techniques are available for performing such analyses. 
The preferred approaches integrate time value procedures, risk and return con￾siderations, and valuation concepts to select capital expenditures that are consist￾ent with the firm’s goal of maximizing owners’ wealth. This chapter focuses on 
the use of these techniques in an environment of certainty.
Bennett Company’s Relevant Cash Flows
We will use one basic problem to illustrate all the techniques described in this chap￾ter. The problem concerns Bennett Company, a medium-sized metal fabricator that is 
currently contemplating two projects with conventional cash flow patterns:1

1. A conventional cash flow pattern is one in which the up-front cash flow is negative and all subsequent cash flows 
are positive. A nonconventional pattern occurs if the up-front cash flow is positive and subsequent cash flows are 
negative (for example, when a firm sells extended warranties and pays benefits later) or when the cash flows oscillate 
between positive and negative (as might occur when firms have to reinvest in a project to extend its life).ChAPTER 10   Capital Budgeting Techniques 445
investment of $45,000. The projected relevant cash flows for the two projects are 
presented in Table 10.1 and depicted on the time lines in Figure 10.1. Both projects 
involve one initial cash outlay followed by annual cash inflows, a fairly typical pat￾tern for new investments. We begin with a look at the three most popular capital 
budgeting techniques: payback period, net present value, and internal rate of return.

the firm? Define the capital budgeting process, and explain how it helps 
managers achieve their goal.
 10.2 Payback Period
Small and medium-sized firms often use the payback period approach to evaluate 
proposed investments. The payback period is the time it takes the firm to recover 
its initial investment in a project, as calculated from cash inflows. In the case of 
an annuity (such as the Bennett Company’s project A), the payback period can be 
found by dividing the initial investment by the annual cash inflow. For a mixed 
stream of cash inflows (such as project B), the yearly cash inflows must be accu￾mulated until the initial investment is recovered. Although popular, the payback 
period is generally viewed as an unsophisticated capital budgeting technique be￾cause it does not explicitly consider the time value of money.
dECISION CRITERIA
When the payback period is used to make accept–reject decisions, the following 
decision criteria apply:
	 •	 If	the	payback	period	is	less than the maximum acceptable payback period, 
accept the project.
	 •	 If	the	payback	period	is	greater than the maximum acceptable payback pe￾riod, reject the project.
The length of the maximum acceptable payback period is determined by 
management. This value is set subjectively on the basis of a number of factors, 
including the type of project (expansion, replacement or renewal, other), the 
product life cycle, the perceived risk of the project, and the perceived relationship 
between the payback period and the share value. It is simply a value that manage￾ment feels, on average, will result in value-creating investment decisions.
We can calculate the payback period for Bennett Company’s projects A and B 
using the data in Table 10.1. For project A, which is an annuity, the payback 
period is 3.0 years ($42,000 initial investment 4 $14,000 annual cash inflow).
Because project B generates a mixed stream of cash inflows, the calculation of its 
payback period is not as clear-cut. In year 1, the firm will recover $28,000 of its 
$45,000 initial investment. By the end of year 2, $40,000 ($28,000 from year 
1 1 $12,000 from year 2) will have been recovered. At the end of year 3, $50,000 
will have been recovered. Only 50% of the year-3 cash inflow of $10,000 is 
needed to complete the payback of the initial $45,000. The payback period for 
project B is therefore 2.5 years (2 years 1 50% of year 3).
Example 10.1 ▶

for a firm to recover its initial 
investment in a project as 
calculated from cash inflows.446 PART 5   Long-Term Investment Decisions
If Bennett’s maximum acceptable payback period were 2.75 years, project A 
would be rejected and project B would be accepted. If the maximum acceptable pay￾back period were 2.25 years, both projects would be rejected. If the projects were 
being ranked, B would be preferred over A because it has a shorter payback period.
PROS ANd CONS OF PAYBACK ANALYSIS
Large firms sometimes use the payback approach to evaluate small projects, and 
small firms use it to evaluate most projects. Its popularity results from its computa￾tional simplicity and intuitive appeal. By measuring how quickly the firm recovers 
its initial investment, the payback period also gives implicit consideration to the 
timing of cash flows and therefore to the time value of money. Because it can be 
viewed as a measure of risk exposure, many firms use the payback period as a deci￾sion criterion or as a supplement to other decision techniques. The longer the firm 
must wait to recover its invested funds, the greater the possibility of a calamity. 
Hence, the shorter the payback period, the lower the firm’s risk exposure.
The major weakness of the payback period is that the appropriate payback 
period is merely a subjectively determined number. It cannot be specified in light 
of the wealth maximization goal because it is not based on discounting cash flows 
to determine whether they add to the firm’s value. Instead, the appropriate pay￾back period is simply the maximum acceptable period of time over which man￾agement decides that a project’s cash flows must break even (that is, just equal to 
the initial investment). The Focus on Practice box offers more information about 
these time limits in actual practice.
Seema Mehdi is considering investing $20,000 to obtain a 5% 
interest in a rental property. Her good friend and real estate agent, 
Akbar Ahmed, put the deal together and he conservatively estimates that Seema 
should receive between $4,000 and $6,000 per year in cash from her 5% interest in 
the property. The deal is structured in a way that forces all investors to maintain their 
investment in the property for at least 10 years. Seema expects to remain in the 25% 
income-tax bracket for quite a while. To be acceptable, Seema requires the invest￾ment to pay itself back in terms of after-tax cash flows in less than 7 years.
Seema’s calculation of the payback period on this deal begins with calcula￾tion of the range of annual after-tax cash flow:
After­tax cash flow = (1 - tax rate) * Pre­tax cash flow
= (1 - 0.25) * $4,000 = $3,000
= (1 - 0.25) * $6,000 = $4,500
The after-tax cash flow ranges from $3,000 to $4,500. Dividing the $20,000 ini￾tial investment by each of the estimated after-tax cash flows, we get the payback 
period:
Payback period = Initial investment , After­tax cash flow
= $20,000 , $3,000 = 6.67 years
= $20,000 , $4,500 = 4.44 years
Because Seema’s proposed rental property investment will pay itself back between 
4.44 and 6.67 years, which is a range below her maximum payback of 7 years, 
the investment is acceptable.

Matter of fact
A
2011 survey of firms in 
 ten Central and Eastern 
European countries found that 
two-thirds of those firms al￾ways or almost always con￾ducted payback analysis 
when they made major invest￾ment decisions. In contrast to 
what has been observed in the 
United States, large firms in 
Eastern Europe were more 
likely than small firms to use 
the payback approach. For all 
its flaws, the payback ap￾proach still sees widespread 
use around the world.
Payback in EuropeChAPTER 10   Capital Budgeting Techniques 447
A second weakness is that this approach fails to take fully into account the 
time factor in the value of money.2
 This weakness can be illustrated by an example.
DeYarman Enterprises, a small medical appliance manufacturer, is considering 
two mutually exclusive projects named Gold and Silver. The firm uses only the 
payback period to choose projects. The cash flows and payback period for each 
project are given in Table 10.2. Both projects have 3-year payback periods, which 
would suggest that they are equally desirable. But comparison of the pattern of 
cash inflows over the first 3 years shows that more of the $50,000 initial invest￾ment in project Silver is recovered sooner than is recovered for project Gold. For 
example, in year 1, $40,000 of the $50,000 invested in project Silver is recovered, 
whereas only $5,000 of the $50,000 investment in project Gold is recovered. 
Given the time value of money, project Silver would clearly be preferred over 
project Gold, even though both have identical 3-year payback periods. The 
Example 10.3 ▶
In tough economic 
times, the standard for 
a payback period is often reduced. 
Chief information officers (CIOs) are apt 
to reject projects with payback periods 
of more than 2 years. “We start with 
payback period,” says Ron Fijalkowski, 
CIO at Strategic Distribution, Inc., in 
Bensalem, Pennsylvania. “For sure, if 
the payback period is over 36 months, 
it’s not going to get approved. But our 
rule of thumb is we’d like to see 24 
months. And if it’s close to 12, it’s prob￾ably a no-brainer.”
Although easy to compute and easy 
to understand, the payback period’s 
simplicity brings with it some draw￾backs. “Payback gives you an answer 
that tells you a bit about the beginning 
stage of a project, but it doesn’t tell you 
much about the full lifetime of the proj￾ect,” says Chris Gardner, a cofounder 
of iValue LLC, an IT valuation

metric for evaluating IT projects—even 
more important than discounted cash 
flow (NPV and IRR)—because it spot￾lights the risks inherent in lengthy IT proj￾ects. “It should be a hard-and-fast rule to 
never take an IT project with a payback 
period greater than 3 years, unless it’s 
an infrastructure project you can’t do 
without,” Campbell says.
Whatever the weaknesses of the pay￾back period method of evaluating capital 
projects, the simplicity of the method does 
allow it to be used in conjunction with 
other, more sophisticated measures. It 
can be used to screen potential projects 
and winnow them down to the few that 
merit more careful scrutiny with, for exam￾ple, net present value (NPV).

consultancy in Barrington, Illinois. “The 
simplicity of computing payback may 
encourage sloppiness, especially the 
failure to include all costs associated 
with an investment, such as training, 
maintenance, and hardware upgrade 
costs,” says Douglas Emond, senior vice 
president and chief technology officer 
at Eastern Bank in Lynn, Massachusetts. 
For example, he says, “you may be 
bringing in a hot new technology, but 
uh-oh, after implementation you realize 
that you need a .Net guru in-house,

But the payback method’s emphasis 
on the short term has a special appeal 
for IT managers. “That’s because the 
history of IT projects that take longer 
than 3 years is disastrous,” says Gard￾ner. Indeed, Ian Campbell, chief re￾search officer at Nucleus Research, Inc.,

2. To consider differences in timing explicitly in applying the payback method, the discounted payback period is 
sometimes used. It is found by first calculating the present value of the cash inflows at the appropriate discount rate 
and then finding the payback period by using the present value of the cash inflows.448 PART 5   Long-Term Investment Decisions
payback approach does not fully account for the time value of money, which, if 
recognized, would cause project Silver to be preferred over project Gold.
A third weakness of payback is its failure to recognize cash flows that occur 
after the payback period.
Rashid Company, a software developer, has two investment opportunities, X and 
Y. Data for X and Y are given in Table 10.3. The payback period for project X is 
2 years; for project Y, it is 3 years. Strict adherence to the payback approach sug￾gests that project X is preferable to project Y. However, if we look beyond the 
payback period, we see that project X returns only an additional $1,200 ($1,000 
in year 3 1 $100 in year 4 1 $100 in year 5), whereas project Y returns an ad￾ditional $7,000 ($4,000 in year 4 1 $3,000 in year 5). On the basis of this infor￾mation, project Y appears preferable to X. The payback approach ignored the 
cash inflows occurring after the end of the payback period.

10–2 What is the payback period? How is it calculated?
10–3 What weaknesses are commonly associated with the use of the payback 
period to evaluate a proposed investment?
 10.3 Net Present Value (NPV)
The method used by most large companies to evaluate investment projects is 
called net present value (NPV). The intuition behind the NPV method is simple. 
When firms make investments, they are spending money that they obtained, in 
one form or another, from investors. Investors expect a return on the money that 
they give to firms, so a firm should undertake an investment only if the present 
value of the cash flow that the investment generates is greater than the cost of 
making the investment in the first place. Because the NPV method takes into ac￾count the time value of investors’ money, it is a more sophisticated capital budg￾eting technique than the payback rule. The NPV method discounts the firm’s cash 
flows at the firm’s cost of capital. This rate—as discussed in Chapter 9— 
represents the firm’s cost of financing and is the minimum return that must be 
earned on a project to satisfy the firm’s investors. Projects with lower returns fail 
to meet investors’ expectations and therefore decrease firm value, and projects 
with higher returns increase firm value.
The net present value (NPV) is found by subtracting a project’s initial invest￾ment (CF0
) from the present value of its cash inflows (CFt
) discounted at a rate 
equal to the firm’s cost of capital (r):
NPV = Present value of cash inflows - Initial investment

When NPV is used, both inflows and outflows are measured in terms of present 
dollars. For a project that has cash outflows beyond the initial investment, the net 
present value of a project would be found by subtracting the present value of 
outflows from the present value of inflows.
dECISION CRITERIA
When NPV is used to make accept–reject decisions, the decision criteria are as 
follows:
	 •	 If	the	NPV	is	greater than $0, accept the project.
	 •	 If	the	NPV	is	less than $0, reject the project.
If the NPV is greater than $0, the firm will earn a return greater than its cost of 
capital. Such action should increase the market value of the firm, and therefore 
the wealth of its owners, by an amount equal to the NPV.
We can illustrate the net present value (NPV) approach by using the Bennett 
Company data presented in Table 10.1. If the firm has a 10% cost of capital, the 
net present values for projects A (an annuity) and B (a mixed stream) can be

calculated as shown on the time lines in Figure 10.2. These calculations result in 
net present values for projects A and B of $11,071 and $10,924, respectively. 
Both projects are acceptable because the net present value of each is greater than 
$0. If the projects were being ranked, however, project A would be considered 
superior to B because it has a higher net present value than that of B ($11,071 
versus $10,924).
Calculator use The preprogrammed NPV function in a financial calculator can 
be used to simplify the NPV calculation. The keystrokes for project A—the annu￾ity—typically are as shown at left. Note that because project A is an annuity, only 
its first cash inflow, CF1 5 14000, is input, followed by its frequency, N 5 5.
The keystrokes for project B—the mixed stream—are as also shown. Because 
the last three cash inflows for project B are the same (CF3 5 CF4 5 CF5 5 10,000), 
after inputting the first of these cash inflows, CF3
, we merely input its frequency, 
N 5 3.
The calculated NPVs for projects A and B of $11,071 and $10,924, respec￾tively, agree with the NPVs already cited.
Spreadsheet use The NPVs can be calculated as shown on the following Excel 
spreadsheet.

When companies evaluate investment opportunities using the PI, the decision rule 
they follow is to invest in the project when the index is greater than 1.0. A PI 
greater than 1.0 implies that the present value of cash inflows is greater than the 
(absolute value of the) initial cash outflow, so a profitability index greater than 
1.0 corresponds to a net present value greater than 0. In other words, the NPV 
and PI methods will always come to the same conclusion regarding whether a 
particular investment is worth doing or not.
We can refer back to Figure 10.2, which shows the present value of cash inflows 
for projects A and B, to calculate the PI for each of Bennett’s investment options:
PIA = $53,071 , $42,000 = 1.26
PIB = $55,924 , $45,000 = 1.24
According to the profitability index, both projects are acceptable (because 
PI 7 1.0 for both), which shouldn’t be surprising because we already know that 
both projects have positive NPVs. Furthermore, in this particular case, the NPV 
rule and the PI both indicate that project A is preferred over project B. It is not

always true that the NPV and PI methods will rank projects in exactly the same 
order. Different rankings can occur when alternative projects require initial out￾lays that have very different magnitudes.
NPV ANd ECONOMIC VALuE AddEd
Economic Value Added (EVA), a registered trademark of the consulting firm 
Stern Stewart & Co., is another close cousin of the NPV method. Whereas the 
NPV approach calculates the value of an investment over its entire life, the EVA 
approach is typically used to measure an investment’s performance on a year-by￾year basis. The EVA method begins the same way that NPV does: by calculating 
a project’s net cash flows. However, the EVA approach subtracts from those cash 
flows a charge that is designed to capture the return that the firm’s investors de￾mand on the project. That is, the EVA calculation asks whether a project gener￾ates positive cash flows above and beyond what investors demand. If so, the 
project is worth undertaking.
The EVA method determines whether a project earns a pure economic profit. 
When accountants say that a firm has earned a profit, they mean that revenues are 
greater than expenses. But the term pure economic profit refers to a profit that is 
higher than expected given the competitive rate of return on a particular line of 
business. A firm that shows a positive profit on its income statement may or may 
not earn a pure economic profit, depending on how large the profit is relative to 
the capital invested in the business. For instance, in the four quarters ending on 
March 30, 2013, Alcoa Inc., the aluminum producing giant, reported that it had 
earned a net profit of $264 million. Does that seem like a large profit? Perhaps it 
doesn’t when you consider that Alcoa’s balance sheet showed total assets of more 
than $40 billion. In other words, Alcoa’s profit represented a return of 0.6% on 
the firm’s assets. That return was not far from the rate offered on risk-free govern￾ment securities in 2013, so it clearly fell below the expectations of Alcoa’s inves￾tors (who would have expected a higher return as compensation for the risks they 
were taking). Thus, the company earned a pure economic loss over those four 
quarters. Stated differently, Alcoa’s EVA during that period was negative.
Suppose that a certain project costs $1,000,000 up front, but after that it will 
generate net cash inflows each year (in perpetuity) of $120,000. To calculate the 
NPV of this project, we would simply discount the cash flows and add them up. 
If the firm’s cost of capital is 10%, the project’s NPV is:4
NPV = -$1,000,000 + ($120,000 , 0.10) = $200,000
To calculate the investment’s economic value added in any particular year, 
we start with the annual $120,000 cash flow. Next, we assign a charge that ac￾counts for the return that investors demand on the capital that the firm has in￾vested in the project. In this case, the firm invested $1,000,000, and investors 
expect a 10% return. That means that the project’s annual capital charge is 
$100,000 ($1,000,000 3 10%), and its EVA is $20,000 per year:
EVA = project cash flow - 3 (cost of capital) * (invested capital) 4
= $120,000 - $100,000 = $20,000
Example 10.7 ▶

A profit above and beyond the 
normal competitive rate of 
return in a line of business.
4. We are using Equation 5.7 to calculate the present value of the perpetual stream of $120,000 cash flows.ChAPTER 10   Capital Budgeting Techniques 453
In other words, this project earns more than its cost of capital each year, so the 
project is clearly worth doing. To calculate the EVA for the project over its entire 
life, we would simply discount the annual EVA figures using the firm’s cost of 
capital. In this case, the project produces an annual EVA of $20,000 in perpetuity. 
Discounting at 10% gives a project EVA of $200,000 ($20,000 4 0.10), identical 
to the NPV. In this example, both the NPV and EVA methods reach the same con￾clusion, namely that the project creates $200,000 in value for shareholders. If the 
cash flows in our example had fluctuated through time rather than remaining fixed 
at $120,000 per year, an analyst would calculate the investment’s EVA every year 
and then discount those figures to the present using the firm’s cost of capital. If the 
resulting figure is positive, the project generates a positive EVA and is worth doing.

 10.4 Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
The internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate that equates the NPV of an 
investment opportunity with $0 (because the present value of cash inflows equals 
the initial investment). It is the rate of return that the firm will earn if it invests in 
the project and receives the given cash inflows. Mathematically, the IRR is the 
value of r in Equation 10.1 that causes NPV to equal $0, or

the NPV of an investment

When IRR is used to make accept–reject decisions, the decision criteria are as

	 •	 If	the	IRR	is	less than the cost of capital, reject the project.454 PART 5   Long-Term Investment Decisions
These criteria guarantee that the firm will earn at least its required return. Such 
an outcome should increase the market value of the firm and therefore the wealth 
of its owners.
CALCuLATING ThE IRR
With these calculators, you merely punch in all cash flows just as if to calculate 
NPV and then depress IRR to find the internal rate of return. Computer software, 
including spreadsheets, is also available for simplifying these calculations. All 
NPV and IRR values presented in this and subsequent chapters are obtained by 
using these functions on a financial calculator.
We can demonstrate the internal rate of return (IRR) approach by using the Bennett 
Company data presented in Table 10.1. Figure 10.3 uses time lines to depict the 
framework for finding the IRRs for Bennett’s projects A and B. We can see in the 
figure that the IRR is the unknown discount rate that causes the NPV to equal $0.
Calculator use To find the IRR using the preprogrammed function in a financial 
calculator, the keystrokes for each project are the same as those shown on pages 
450 and 451 for the NPV calculation, except that the last two NPV keystrokes 
(punching I and then NPV) are replaced by a single IRR keystroke.

Comparing the IRRs of projects A and B given in Figure 10.3 to Bennett 
Company’s 10% cost of capital, we can see that both projects are acceptable 
because
IRRA = 19.9, 7 10.0, cost of capital
IRRB = 21.7, 7 10.0, cost of capital
Comparing the two projects’ IRRs, we prefer project B over project A because 
project B delivers a higher IRR (IRRB = 21.7, 7 IRRA = 19.9,). If these pro￾jects are mutually exclusive, meaning that we can choose one project or the other 
but not both, the IRR decision technique would recommend project B.
Spreadsheet use The internal rate of return also can be calculated as shown on 
the following Excel spreadsheet.
In the preceding example, note that the IRR suggests that project B, which 
has an IRR of 21.7%, is preferable to project A, which has an IRR of 19.9%. This 
suggestion conflicts with the NPV rankings obtained in an earlier example. Such 
conflicts are not unusual. There is no guarantee that NPV and IRR will rank pro￾jects in the same order. However, both methods usually reach the same conclu￾sion about whether a single project, considered in isolation, is acceptable or not.
Tony DiLorenzo is evaluating an investment opportunity. He 
is comfortable with the investment’s level of risk. Based on 
competing investment opportunities, he believes that this investment must earn a 
minimum compound annual after-tax return of 9% to be acceptable. Tony’s ini￾tial investment would be $7,500, and he expects to receive annual after-tax cash 
flows of $500 per year in each of the first 4 years, followed by $700 per year at 
the end of years 5 through 8. He plans to sell the investment at the end of year 8 
and net $9,000, after taxes.

 10.5 Comparing NPV and IRR Techniques
To understand the differences between the NPV and IRR techniques and decision 
makers’ preferences in their use, we need to look at net present value profiles, 
conflicting rankings, and the question of which approach is better.
NET PRESENT VALuE PROFILES
Projects can be compared graphically by constructing net present value profiles
that depict the project’s NPVs for various discount rates. These profiles are useful 
in evaluating and comparing projects, especially when conflicting rankings exist. 
They are best demonstrated via an example.

To calculate the investment’s IRR (compound annual return), Tony first 
summarizes the after-tax cash flows as shown in the following table:ChAPTER 10   Capital Budgeting Techniques 457
To prepare net present value profiles for Bennett Company’s two projects, A and 
B, the first step is to develop a number of “discount rate–net present value” coor￾dinates. Three coordinates can be easily obtained for each project; they are at a 
discount rate of 0%, at a discount rate of 10% (the cost of capital, r), and the 
IRR. The net present value at a 0% discount rate is found by merely adding all the 
cash inflows and subtracting the initial investment. Using the data in Table 10.1 
and Figure 10.1, we get
For project A:
($14,000 + $14,000 + $14,000 + $14,000 + $14,000) - $42,000 = $28,000
For project B:
($28,000 + $12,000 + $10,000 + $10,000 + $10,000) - $45,000 = $25,000
The net present values for projects A and B at the 10% cost of capital are $11,071 
and $10,924, respectively (from Figure 10.2). Because the IRR is the discount 
rate for which net present value equals zero, the IRRs (from Figure 10.3) of 
19.9% for project A and 21.7% for project B result in $0 NPVs. The three sets of 
coordinates for each of the projects are summarized in Table 10.4.
Plotting the data from Table 10.4 on the next page results in the net present 
value profiles for projects A and B shown in Figure 10.4. The figure reveals three 
important facts:
 1. The IRR of project B is greater than the IRR of project A, so managers using 
the IRR method to rank projects will always choose B over A if both projects 
are acceptable.
 2. The NPV of project A is sometimes higher and sometimes lower than the NPV 
of project B; thus, the NPV method will not consistently rank A above B or 
vice versa. The NPV ranking will depend on the firm’s cost of capital.
 3. When the cost of capital is approximately 10.7%, projects A and B have iden￾tical NPVs.
The cost of capital for Bennett Company is 10%; at that rate, project A has a 
higher NPV than project B (the red line is above the blue line in Figure 10.4 when 
the discount rate is 10%). Therefore, the NPV and IRR methods rank the two 
projects differently. If Bennett’s cost of capital were a little higher, say 12%, the 
NPV method would rank project B over project A and there would be no conflict 
in the rankings provided by the NPV and IRR approaches.

CONFLICTING RANKINGS
Ranking different investment opportunities is an important consideration when 
projects are mutually exclusive or when capital rationing is necessary. When pro￾jects are mutually exclusive, ranking enables the firm to determine which project 
is best from a financial standpoint. When capital rationing is necessary, ranking 
projects will provide a logical starting point for determining which group of pro￾jects to accept. As we’ll see, conflicting rankings using NPV and IRR result from 
differences in the reinvestment rate assumption, the timing of each project’s cash 
flows, and the magnitude of the initial investment.
Reinvestment Assumption
One underlying cause of conflicting rankings is different implicit assumptions 
about the reinvestment of intermediate cash inflows, cash inflows received prior 
to the termination of a project. NPV assumes that intermediate cash inflows are 
reinvested at the cost of capital, whereas IRR assumes that intermediate cash in￾flows are reinvested at a rate equal to the project’s IRR.5
 These differing assump￾tions can be demonstrated with an example.
A project requiring a $170,000 initial investment is expected to provide operat￾ing cash inflows of $52,000, $78,000, and $100,000 at the end of each of the 
next 3 years. The NPV of the project (at the firm’s 10% cost of capital) is $16,867, 
and its IRR is 15%. Clearly, the project is acceptable (NPV = $16,867 7 $0
and IRR = 15, 7 10, cost of capital). Table 10.5 demonstrates calculation of 
the project’s future value at the end of its 3-year life, assuming both a 10% (its 
cost of capital) and a 15% (its IRR) rate of return. A future value of $248,720 
results from reinvestment at the 10% cost of capital, and a future value of 
$258,470 results from reinvestment at the 15% IRR.

intermediate cash inflows
Cash inflows received prior to

5. To eliminate the reinvestment rate assumption of the IRR, some practitioners calculate the modified internal rate of 
return (MIRR). The MIRR is found by converting each operating cash inflow to its future value measured at the end of 
the project’s life and then summing the future values of all inflows to get the project’s terminal value. Each future value 
is found by using the cost of capital, thereby eliminating the reinvestment rate criticism of the traditional IRR. The 
MIRR represents the discount rate that causes the terminal value just to equal the initial investment. Because it uses the 
cost of capital as the reinvestment rate, the MIRR is generally viewed as a better measure of a project’s true profitability 
than the IRR. Although this technique is frequently used in commercial real estate valuation and is a preprogrammed 
function on some financial calculators, its failure to resolve the issue of conflicting rankings and its theoretical inferior￾ity to NPV have resulted in the MIRR receiving only limited attention and acceptance in the financial literature.ChAPTER 10   Capital Budgeting Techniques 459
If the future value in each case in Table 10.5 were viewed as the return re￾ceived 3 years from today from the $170,000 initial investment, the cash flows 
would be those given in Table 10.6. The NPVs and IRRs in each case are shown 
below the cash flows in Table 10.6. You can see that at the 10% reinvestment 
rate, the NPV remains at $16,867; reinvestment at the 15% IRR produces an 
NPV of $24,192.
From this result, it should be clear that the NPV technique assumes reinvest￾ment at the cost of capital (10% in this example). (Note that with reinvestment at 
10%, the IRR would be 13.5%.) On the other hand, the IRR technique assumes 
an ability to reinvest intermediate cash inflows at the IRR. If reinvestment does 
not occur at this rate, the IRR will differ from 15%. Reinvestment at a rate lower 
than the IRR would result in an IRR lower than that calculated (at 13.5%, for 
example, if the reinvestment rate were only 10%). Reinvestment at a rate higher 
than the IRR would result in an IRR higher than that calculated.

Ranking Projects A and B Using IRR and 
NPV Methods
Timing of the Cash Flow
Another reason the IRR and NPV methods may provide different rankings for 
investment options has to do with differences in the timing of cash flows. Go 
back to the timelines for investments A and B in Figure 10.1 on page 444. The 
up-front investment required by each investment is similar, but after that, the 
timing of each project’s cash flows is quite different. Project B has a large cash 
inflow almost immediately (in year 1), whereas Project A provides cash flows 
that are distributed evenly across time. Because so much of Project B’s cash 
flows arrive early in its life (especially compared to the timing for Project A), 
the NPV of Project B will not be particularly sensitive to changes in the dis￾count rate. Project A’s NPV, on the other hand, will fluctuate more as the dis￾count rate changes. In essence, Project B is somewhat akin to a short-term 
bond, whose price doesn’t change much when interest rates move, and Project 
A is more like a long-term bond whose price fluctuates a great deal when rates 
change.
You can see this pattern if you review the NPV profiles for projects A and B 
in Figure 10.4 on page 458. The red line representing project A is considerably 
steeper than the blue line representing project B. At very low discount rates, pro￾ject A has a higher NPV, but as the discount rate increases, the NPV of project A 
declines rapidly. When the discount rate is high enough, the NPV of project B 
overtakes that of project A.
We can summarize this discussion as follows. Because project A’s cash flows 
arrive later than project B’s cash flows do, when the firm’s cost of capital is rela￾tively low (to be specific, below about 10.7 percent), the NPV method will rank 
project A ahead of project B. At a higher cost of capital, the early arrival of pro￾ject B’s cash flows becomes more advantageous, and the NPV method will rank 
project B over project A. The differences in the timing of cash flows between the 
two projects does not affect the ranking provided by the IRR method, which al￾ways puts project B ahead of project A. Table 10.7 illustrates how the conflict in 
rankings between the NPV and IRR approaches depends on the firm’s cost of 
capital.
Magnitude of the Initial Investment
Suppose that someone offered you the following two investment options. You 
could invest $2 today and receive $3 tomorrow, or you could invest $1,000 to￾day and receive $1,100 tomorrow. The first investment provides a return (an 
IRR) of 50 percent in just 1 day, a return that surely would surpass any reasona￾ble hurdle rate. But after making this investment, you’re only better off by $1. On 
TABLE 10.7
Method Project A Project B
IRR   ✓
NPV    
if r , 10.7% ✓
if r . 10.7%   ✓ChAPTER 10   Capital Budgeting Techniques 461
the other hand, the second choice offers a return of 10 percent in a single day. 
That’s far less than the first opportunity, but earning 10 percent in a single day is 
still a very high return. In addition, if you accept this investment, you will be 
$100 better off tomorrow than you were today.
Most people would choose the second option presented above, even though 
the rate of return on that option (10 percent) is far less than the rate offered by 
the first option (50 percent). They reason (correctly) that it is sometimes better to 
accept a lower return on a larger investment than to accept a very high return on 
a small investment. Said differently, most people know that they are better off 
taking the investment that pays them a $100 profit in just 1 day rather than the 
investment that generates just a $1 profit.6
The preceding example illustrates what is known as the scale (or magnitude) 
problem. The scale problem occurs when two projects are very different in terms 
of how much money is required to invest in each project. In these cases, the IRR 
and NPV methods may rank projects differently. The IRR approach (and the PI 
method) may favor small projects with high returns (like the $2 loan that turns 
into $3), whereas the NPV approach favors the investment that makes the inves￾tor the most money (like the $1,000 investment that yields $1,100 in 1 day). In 
the case of the Bennett Company’s projects, the scale problem is not likely to be 
the cause of the conflict in project rankings because the initial investment required 
to fund each project is quite similar.
To summarize, it is important for financial managers to keep an eye out for 
conflicts in project rankings provided by the NPV and IRR methods, but differ￾ences in the magnitude and timing of cash inflows do not guarantee conflicts in 
ranking. In general, the greater the difference between the magnitude and timing 
of cash inflows, the greater the likelihood of conflicting rankings. Conflicts based 
on NPV and IRR can be reconciled computationally; to do so, one creates and 
analyzes an incremental project reflecting the difference in cash flows between 
the two mutually exclusive projects.
WhICh APPROACh IS BETTER?
Many companies use both the NPV and IRR techniques because current technol￾ogy makes them easy to calculate. But it is difficult to choose one approach over 
the other because the theoretical and practical strengths of the approaches differ. 
Clearly, it is wise to evaluate NPV and IRR techniques from both theoretical and 
practical points of view.
Theoretical View
On a purely theoretical basis, NPV is the better approach to capital budgeting as 
a result of several factors. Most important, the NPV measures how much wealth 
a project creates (or destroys if the NPV is negative) for shareholders. Given that 
the financial manager’s objective is to maximize shareholder wealth, the NPV ap￾proach has the clearest link to this objective and therefore is the “gold standard” 
for evaluating investment opportunities.
6. Note that the profitability index also provides an incorrect ranking in this example. The first option has a PI of 
1.5 ($3 ÷ $2), and the second option’s PI equals 1.1 ($1,100 ÷ $1,000). Just like the IRR, the PI suggests that the first 
option is better, but we know that the second option makes more money.462 PART 5   Long-Term Investment Decisions
In addition, certain mathematical properties may cause a project with a non￾conventional cash flow pattern to have multiple IRRs, or more than one IRR. 
Mathematically, the maximum number of real roots to an equation is equal to its 
number of sign changes. Take an equation like x
2 - 5x + 6 = 0, which has two 
sign changes in its coefficients—from positive (+x
2
) to negative (-5x) and then 
from negative (-5x) to positive (+6). If we factor the equation (remember factor￾ing from high school math?), we get (x - 2) * (x - 3), which means that x can 
equal either 2 or 3; there are two correct values for x. Substitute them back into 
the equation, and you’ll see that both values work.
This same outcome can occur when finding the IRR for projects with non￾conventional cash flows because they have more than one sign change in the 
stream of cash flows. Clearly, when multiple IRRs occur for nonconventional 
cash flows, the analyst faces the time-consuming need to interpret their meanings 
so as to evaluate the project. That such a challenge does not exist when using 
NPV enhances its theoretical superiority.
Practical View
Evidence suggests that despite the theoretical superiority of NPV, financial man￾agers use the IRR approach just as often as the NPV method. The appeal of the 
IRR technique is due to the general disposition of business people to think in 
terms of rates of return rather than actual dollar returns. Because interest rates, 
profitability, and so on are most often expressed as annual rates of return, the use 
of IRR makes sense to financial decision makers. They tend to find NPV less in￾tuitive because it does not measure benefits relative to the amount invested. Be￾cause a variety of techniques are available for avoiding the pitfalls of the IRR, its 
widespread use does not imply a lack of sophistication on the part of financial 
decision makers. Clearly, corporate financial analysts are responsible for identify￾ing and resolving problems with the IRR before the decision makers use it as a 
decision technique.
multiple IRRs
More than one IRR resulting 
from a capital budgeting 
project with a nonconventional 
cash flow pattern; the 
maximum number of IRRs for a 
project is equal to the number 
of sign changes in its cash 
flows.
Matter of fact
R
esearchers surveyed chief financial officers (CFOs) about what methods the CFOs used to 
evaluate capital investment projects. One interesting finding was that many companies use 
more than one of the approaches we’ve covered in this chapter. The most popular approaches by 
far were IRR and NPV, used by 76 percent and 75 percent (respectively) of the CFOs responding 
to the survey. These techniques enjoy wider use in larger firms, with the payback approach being 
more common in smaller firms.7

Corporate ethics codes 
are often faulted for 
being “window dressing,” for having lit￾tle or no effect on actual behavior. 
Financial ethics expert John Dobson 
says day-to-day behavior in the work￾place “acculturates” employees, teach￾ing them that the behavior they see is 
rational and acceptable in that environ￾ment. The good news is that profes￾sional ethics codes, such as those 
developed for chartered financial ana￾lysts, corporate treasury professionals, 
and certified financial planners, actually 
provide sound guidelines for behavior. 
These codes, notes Dobson, are based 
on economically rational concepts such 
as integrity and trustworthiness, which 
guide the decision maker in attempting 
to increase shareholder wealth. Finan￾cial executives insist that there should be 
no separation between an individual’s 
personal ethics and his or her business 
ethics. “It’s a jungle out there” and 
“Business is business” should not be 
excuses for engaging in unethical 
behavior.
How do ethics codes apply to pro￾ject selection and capital budgeting? For 
most companies, ethical considerations 
are primarily concerned with the reduc￾tion of potential risks associated with a 
project. For example, Gateway Comput￾ers clearly outlines in its corporate code 
of ethics the increased regulatory and 
procurement laws with which an 
employee must be familiar so as to sell to 
the government. The company points out 
that knowingly submitting a false claim or 
statement to a governmental agency 
could subject Gateway and its employ￾ees to significant monetary civil damages, 
penalties, and even criminal sanctions.
Another way to incorporate nonfi￾nancial considerations into capital proj￾ect evaluation is to take into account the 
likely effect of decisions on nonshare￾holder parties or stakeholders: employ￾ees, customers, the local community, 
and suppliers. Chipotle Mexican Grill’s 
“Food with Integrity” mission is one 
example. Chipotle’s philosophy is that 
the company “can always do better in 
terms of the food we buy. And when 
we say better, we mean better in every 
sense of the word—better tasting, com￾ing from better sources, better for the 
environment, better for the animals, and 
better for the farmers who raise the ani￾mals and grow the produce.”a
In support of their mission, Chipotle 
sources meat from animals that are 
raised humanely, fed a vegetarian diet, 
and never given antibiotics or hormones. 
The company favors locally grown pro￾duce, organically grown beans, and 
dairy products made from milk from 
cows raised in pastures and free of 
growth hormones. Chipotle’s efforts have 
been rewarded, as sales increased by 
nearly 50 percent from 2007 to 2009 
and by nearly 80 percent from 2009 to 
2012. Investors have also profited, as 
shares that sold for $44 at the compa￾ny’s 2006 initial public offering were 
priced at over $400 in mid-2013.

Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
The financial manager must apply appropriate decision techniques to assess 
whether proposed investment projects create value. Net present value (NPV) 
and internal rate of return (IRR) are the generally preferred capital budgeting 
techniques. Both use the cost of capital as the required return. The appeal of 
NPV and IRR stems from both indicating whether a proposed investment cre￾ates or destroys shareholder value.
NPV clearly indicates the expected dollar amount of wealth creation from a 
proposed project, whereas IRR only provides the same accept-or-reject decision 
as NPV. As a consequence of some fundamental differences, NPV and IRR do 
not necessarily rank projects in the same way. NPV is the theoretically preferred 
approach. In practice, however, IRR enjoys widespread use because of its intui￾tive appeal. Regardless, the application of NPV and IRR to good estimates of 
relevant cash flows should enable the financial manager to recommend projects 
that are consistent with the firm’s goal of maximizing shareholder wealth.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Understand the key elements of the capital budgeting process. Capital 
budgeting techniques are the tools used to assess project acceptability and rank￾ing. Applied to each project’s relevant cash flows, they indicate which capital ex￾penditures are consistent with the firm’s goal of maximizing owners’ wealth.
Calculate, interpret, and evaluate the payback period. The payback pe￾riod is the amount of time required for the firm to recover its initial investment, 
as calculated from cash inflows. Shorter payback periods are preferred. The 
payback period is relatively easy to calculate, has simple intuitive appeal, consid￾ers cash flows, and measures risk exposure. Its weaknesses include lack of link￾age to the wealth maximization goal, failure to consider time value explicitly, 
and that it ignores cash flows that occur after the payback period.
Calculate, interpret, and evaluate the net present value (NPV) and eco￾nomic value added (EVA). Because it gives explicit consideration to the time 
value of money, NPV is considered a sophisticated capital budgeting technique. 
NPV measures the amount of value created by a given project; only positive 
NPV projects are acceptable. The rate at which cash flows are discounted in cal￾culating NPV is called the discount rate, required return, cost of capital, or op￾portunity cost. By whatever name, this rate represents the minimum return that 
must be earned on a project to leave the firm’s market value unchanged. The 
EVA method begins the same way that NPV does: by calculating a project’s net 
cash flows. However, the EVA approach subtracts from those cash flows a 
charge that is designed to capture the return that the firm’s investors demand on 
the project. That is, the EVA calculation asks whether a project generates posi￾tive cash flows above and beyond what investors demand. If so, the project is 
worth undertaking.

Calculate, interpret, and evaluate the internal rate of return (IRR). Like 
NPV, IRR is a sophisticated capital budgeting technique. IRR is the compound 
annual rate of return that the firm will earn by investing in a project and receiv￾ing the given cash inflows. By accepting only those projects with IRRs in excess 
of the firm’s cost of capital, the firm should enhance its market value and the 
wealth of its owners. Both NPV and IRR yield the same accept–reject decisions, 
but they often provide conflicting rankings.
Use net present value profiles to compare NPV and IRR techniques. A 
net present value profile is a graph that depicts projects’ NPVs for various dis￾count rates. The NPV profile is prepared by developing a number of “discount 
rate–net present value” coordinates (including discount rates of 0 percent, the 
cost of capital, and the IRR for each project) and then plotting them on the 
same set of discount rate–NPV axes.
Discuss NPV and IRR in terms of conflicting rankings and the theoretical 
and practical strengths of each approach. Conflicting rankings of projects 
frequently emerge from NPV and IRR as a result of differences in the reinvest￾ment rate assumption as well as the magnitude and timing of cash flows. NPV 
assumes reinvestment of intermediate cash inflows at the more conservative cost 
of capital; IRR assumes reinvestment at the project’s IRR. On a purely 
theoretical basis, NPV is preferred over IRR because NPV assumes the more 
conservative reinvestment rate and does not exhibit the mathematical problem 
of multiple IRRs that often occurs when IRRs are calculated for nonconven￾tional cash flows. In practice, the IRR is more commonly used because it is 
consistent with the general preference of business professionals for rates of re￾turn, and corporate financial analysts can identify and resolve problems with the 
IRR before decision makers use it.

 P10–11 Long-term investment decision, NPV method Mavis Chan is currently a Financial 
Controller of a listed company, and has researched the financial pros and cons of enrolling 
in a 1-year Executive MBA (EMBA) program at her local university. The tuition and 
books for the EMBA program will involve an up-front cost of $67,000. If she enrolls in 
the EMBA program, Mavis will quit her current job, which pays $86,000 per year after 
taxes (for simplicity, treat any lost earnings as part of the up-front cost). On average, a 
person with an EMBA degree earns an extra $48,000 per year (after taxes) over a business 
career of 40 years. Mavis believes that her opportunity cost of capital is 5%. Given her 
estimates, find the net present value (NPV) of entering this EMBA program. Are the 
benefits of further education worth the associated costs?

 P10–28 ETHICS PROBLEM Diane Dennison is a financial analyst working for a large 
chain of discount retail stores. Her company is looking at the possibility of replacing 
the existing fluorescent lights in all of its stores with LED lights. The main advan￾tage of making this switch is that the LED lights are much more efficient and will 
cost less to operate. In addition, the LED lights last much longer and will have to be 
replaced after ten years, whereas the existing lights have to be replaced after five 
years. Of course, making this change will require a large investment to purchase new 
LED lights and to pay for the labor of switching out tens of thousands of bulbs. 
Diane plans to use a 10-year horizon to analyze this proposal, figuring that changes 
to lighting technology will eventually make this investment obsolete.
Diane’s friend and coworker, David, has analyzed another energy-saving invest￾ment opportunity that involves replacing outdoor lighting with solar-powered fix￾tures in a few of the company’s stores. David also used a 10-year horizon to conduct 
his analysis. Cash flow forecasts for each project appear below. The company uses a

to maintain and facilitate the retrieval of cash flow data for both completed and 
existing projects.
mAnAgement You need to understand capital budgeting cash flows so that 
you will understand which cash flows are relevant in making decisions about pro￾posals for acquiring additional production facilities, for new marketing programs, 
for new products, and for the expansion of existing product lines.

iamond Comic Distributors is the world’s 
largest distributor of English-language com￾ics and graphic novels. As a distributor, Diamond 
has a strong incentive to see the retail segment of 
the comic book market thrive. In the summer of 
2013, Diamond announced a new plan to help 
retail comic book stores expand. Under the new 
plan, Diamond would offer significant discounts 
on comic books and related merchandise to 
retailers who were opening new stores. The cost 
of opening a new, fully stocked comic book store 
can run as much as $400,000, and most of that 
investment is the cost of filling a store’s shelves with new merchandise inventory.
In announcing its new program, Diamond recognized that comic book retailers could only ex￾pand if they could earn a sufficient return on their investment and that for some businesses the initial 
cost of inventory was at least as important as the costs associated with fixed assets. By lowering the 
up-front costs required to open a new comic book store, Diamond was hoping to raise the rate of 
return (and the NPV) that retailers could earn by expanding their operations.
Every firm must evaluate the costs and returns of projects for expansion, asset replacement or 
renewal, research and development, advertising, and other areas that require a long-term commit￾ment of funds in expectation of future returns. This chapter explains how to identify the relevant cash 
outflows and inflows that must be considered in making major investment decisions.

flows associated with the project: the incremental cash outflows (investment) and 
inflows (return). The incremental cash flows represent the additional cash flows—
outflows or inflows—expected to result from a proposed capital expenditure. As 
noted in Chapter 4, we focus on cash flows rather than accounting figures be￾cause cash flows directly affect the firm’s ability to pay bills and purchase assets. 
The Focus on Ethics box discusses the accuracy of cash flow estimates and cites 
one reason even well-estimated deals may not work out as planned.
The remainder of this chapter is devoted to the procedures for measuring the 
relevant cash flows associated with proposed capital expenditures.
MAJOR CASh FLOW COMPONENTS
The cash flows of any project may include three basic components: (1) an initial 
investment, (2) operating cash flows (which may be inflows or outflows), and 
(3) terminal cash flow. All projects—whether for expansion, replacement or

incremental cash flows
The additional cash flows—
outflows or inflows—expected 
to result from a proposed 
capital expenditure.
The process of capital 
budgeting based on 
projected cash flows has been a part of 
the investment decision process for 
many years. This procedure for evaluat￾ing investment opportunities works well 
when cash flows can be estimated with 
certainty, but in real-world corporate 
practice, many investment decisions in￾volve a high degree of uncertainty. The 
decision is even more complicated 
when the project under consideration is 
the acquisition of another company or 
part of another company.
Because estimates of the cash flows 
from an investment project involve mak￾ing assumptions about the future, they 
may be subject to considerable error. 
The problem becomes more complicated 
as the period of time under consideration 
becomes longer as well as when the 
project is unique and there are no histori￾cal precedents to use in forming cash 
flow forecasts. Other complications may 
arise involving accounting for additional 
(extraordinary) cash flows, such as the 
cost of litigation, compliance with 
tougher environmental standards, or the 
costs of disposal or recycling of an asset 
at the completion of the project.
For managers of a firm, undertaking 
a new, major investment can be exhilarat￾ing. All too often, however, the initial 
champagne celebration gives way once 
the final cost of a deal is tallied. A large 
body of research suggests that, on aver￾age, mergers and acquisitions do not cre￾ate much value for the acquiring firms, 
and, in fact, these deals may harm 
acquiring shareholders more often than 
not. Although the financial data necessary 
to generate discounted cash flow esti￾mates are ever more readily available, 
more attention is being paid to the accu￾racy of the numbers. Inspired in part by 
increased scrutiny from government and 
the threat of shareholder lawsuits, board 
members have been pushing corporate 
managers to make a stronger case for the 
deals they propose. Says Glenn Gurtcheff, 
managing director and cohead of middle 
market M&A for Piper Jaffray & Co., 
“They’re not just taking the company’s 
audited and unaudited financial state￾ments at face value; they are really diving 
into the numbers and trying to understand 
not just their accuracy, but what they 
mean in terms of trends.”
If valuation has improved so much, 
why do analyses show that the share￾holders of acquiring companies often do 
not benefit from mergers and acquisi￾tions? The answer may be found in the 
CEO’s office. Improvements in valuation 
techniques can be negated when the 
process deteriorates into a game of 
tweaking the numbers to justify a deal 
the CEO wants to do, regardless of 
price. This “make it work” form of capital 
budgeting may result in building the 
empire under the CEO’s control at the 
expense of the firm’s shareholders.

renewal, or some other purpose—have the first two components. Some, however, 
lack the final component, terminal cash flow.
Figure 11.1 depicts on a time line the cash flows for a project. The initial 
investment for the proposed project is $50,000, the relevant cash outflow at 
time zero. The operating cash flows, which are the net incremental after-tax 
cash inflows and outflows resulting from implementation of the project during 
its life, gradually increase from $4,000 in its first year to $10,000 in its tenth 
and final year. For the project depicted in Figure 11.1, the net operating cash 
flows are all positive, but that is not necessarily the case for every investment 
opportunity. The terminal cash flow is the after-tax nonoperating cash flow oc￾curring in the final year of the project. It is usually attributable to liquidation of 
the project. In this case, it is $25,000, received at the end of the project’s 
10-year life. Note that the terminal cash flow does not include the $10,000 op￾erating cash inflow for year 10.
ExPANSION VERSuS REPLACEMENT dECISIONS
Developing relevant cash flow estimates is most straightforward in the case of 
expansion decisions. In this case, the initial investment, operating cash flows, and 
terminal cash flow are merely the after-tax cash flows associated with the pro￾posed expansion.
Identifying relevant cash flows for replacement decisions is more complicated 
because the firm must identify the incremental cash flows that would result from 
the proposed replacement. The initial investment in the case of replacement is the 
difference between the initial investment needed to acquire the new asset and any 
after-tax cash inflows or outflows expected from liquidation of the old asset. The 
operating cash flows are the difference between the operating cash flows from the 
new asset and those from the old asset. The terminal cash flow is the difference 
between the after-tax cash flows expected upon termination of the new and the 
old assets. These relationships are shown in Figure 11.2.
Actually, all capital budgeting decisions can be viewed as replacement deci￾sions. Expansion decisions are merely replacement decisions in which all cash 
flows from the old asset are zero. In light of this fact, this chapter focuses primar￾ily on replacement decisions.

SuNK COSTS ANd OPPORTuNITY COSTS
When estimating the relevant cash flows associated with a proposed capital ex￾penditure, the firm must recognize any sunk costs and opportunity costs. These 
costs are easy to mishandle or ignore, particularly when determining a project’s 
incremental cash flows. Sunk costs are cash outlays that have already been made 
(past outlays) and cannot be recovered. Sunk costs have no effect on the cash 
flows relevant to the current decision. As a result, sunk costs should not be in￾cluded in a project’s incremental cash flows.
Opportunity costs are cash flows that could be realized from the best alterna￾tive use of an asset that is already in place. They therefore represent cash flows 
that will not be realized as a result of employing that asset in the proposed proj￾ect. Thus, any opportunity costs should be included as cash outflows when one is 
determining a project’s incremental cash flows.
Jankow Equipment is considering renewing its drill press X12, which it pur￾chased 3 years earlier for $237,000, by retrofitting it with the computerized con￾trol system from an obsolete piece of equipment it owns. The obsolete equipment 
could be sold today for a $42,000, but without its computerized control system, 
it would be worth nothing. Jankow is in the process of estimating the labor and 
materials costs of retrofitting the system to drill press X12 and the benefits 
expected from the retrofit. The $237,000 cost of drill press X12 is a sunk cost
because it represents an earlier cash outlay. It would not be included as a cash 
outflow when determining the cash flows relevant to the retrofit decision. On the 
other hand, if Jankow uses the computerized control system of the obsolete ma￾chine, there is an opportunity cost of $42,000, which is the cash that Jankow 
could have received by selling the obsolete equipment in its current condition. By 
retrofitting the drill press, Jankow gives up the opportunity to sell the old equip￾ment for $42,000. This opportunity cost would be included as a cash outflow 
associated with using the computerized control system.

INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL BudGETING ANd LONG-TERM 
INVESTMENTS
Although the same basic capital budgeting principles are used for domestic as 
well as international projects, several additional factors must be addressed in 
evaluating foreign investment opportunities. International capital budgeting dif￾fers from the domestic version because (1) cash outflows and inflows occur in a 
foreign currency and (2) foreign investments entail potentially significant political 
risk. Both of these risks can be minimized through careful planning.
Companies face both long-term and short-term currency risks related to both 
the invested capital and the cash flows resulting from it. Long-term currency risk 
can be minimized by financing the foreign investment at least partly in the local 
capital markets. This step ensures that the project’s revenues, operating costs, 
and financing costs will be in the local currency. Likewise, the dollar value of 
short-term, local-currency cash flows can be protected by using special securities 
and strategies such as futures, forwards, and options market instruments.
Political risks can be minimized by using both operating and financial strate￾gies. For example, by structuring the investment as a joint venture and selecting a 
well-connected local partner, the U.S. company can minimize the risk of its op￾erations being seized or harassed. Companies also can protect themselves from 
having their investment returns blocked by local governments by structuring the 
financing of such investments as debt rather than as equity. Debt-service pay￾ments are legally enforceable claims, whereas equity returns (such as dividends) 
are not. Even if local courts do not support the claims of the U.S. company, the 
company can threaten to pursue its case in U.S. courts.
Despite the preceding difficulties, foreign direct investment (FDI), which in￾volves the transfer of capital, managerial, and technical assets to a foreign coun￾try, has surged in recent years. Such investment is evident in the growing market 
values of foreign assets owned by U.S.–based companies and of foreign direct in￾vestment in the United States, particularly by British, Canadian, Chinese, Dutch, 
German, and Japanese companies. Furthermore, foreign direct investment by 
U.S. companies seems to be accelerating. See the Global Focus box for a discus￾sion of recent foreign direct investment in China.

assets to a foreign country.
Matter of fact
A
ccording to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), FDI 
plays an important role in the U.S. economy. BEA divides FDI into two categories: (1) Green￾field Investment and (2) Mergers and Acquisitions. Greenfield Investments creates new enterprises 
and develops or expands production facilities. Mergers and Acquisitions involves the purchase of 
an existing enterprise.
In 2012, the United States was the world’s largest recipient of FDI, receiving $174.7 billion 
in FDI. However, that figure represented a decrease from the record $234 billion in FDI received 
in 2011. Perhaps not surprisingly, China is not far behind the United States. In fact, for the first 
half of 2012, more FDI flowed into China than into any other country.

 11.2 Finding the Initial Investment
The term initial investment as used here refers to the relevant cash outflows to be 
considered when evaluating a prospective capital expenditure. Our discussion of 
capital budgeting will focus on projects with initial investments that occur at time 
zero, the time at which the expenditure is made. The initial investment is calcu￾lated by subtracting all cash inflows occurring at time zero from all cash outflows 
occurring at time zero.
The basic format for determining the initial investment is given in Table 
11.1. The cash flows that must be considered when determining the initial in￾vestment associated with a capital expenditure are the installed cost of the new 
Foreign direct invest￾ment in China has 
been growing rapidly for many years. 
From 2001 to 2011, FDI in China 
grew from $46.9 billion to $116 
billion, a compound annual growth rate 
of roughly 9.5%. China allows three 
types of foreign investments: a wholly 
foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE), in 
which the firm is entirely funded with for￾eign capital; a joint venture, in which 
the foreign partner must provide at least 
25 percent of initial capital; and a rep￾resentative office (RO), the most com￾mon and easily established entity, 
which cannot perform business activities 
that directly result in profits. Generally, 
an RO is the first step in establishing a 
China presence and includes mecha￾nisms for upgrading to a WFOE or joint 
venture. More than three-fourths of the 
dollar value of Chinese FDI takes the 
form of wholly-owned foreign enter￾prises operating in China, and most of 
the rest consists of joint ventures.
China has run a trade surplus for 
many years, although recently the sur￾plus has been shrinking, and some out￾siders believe that the surplus figures are 
artificially inflated by the Chinese gov￾ernment. With the trade surplus, China 
is no longer desperate for capital from 
overseas, but is now primarily interested 
in foreign skills and technologies. Prime 
Minister Li Keqiang wants to steer invest￾ments toward science and technology. 
Li is giving tax breaks and promising 
speedy approvals for investments in the 
country’s western and central regions.
Typical of foreign investors in China 
is Intel Capital, a subsidiary of Intel Cor￾poration. From 1998 to 2013, Intel 
Capital invested more than $670 mil￾lion in more than 110 companies in 
China. Intel Capital focuses its invest￾ments in projects such as data centers 
and cloud computing, smartphones and 
tablets, and semiconductor design and 
manufacturing. Intel Capital is no begin￾ner at foreign investment; it has invested 
more than $10.8 billion in almost 
1,300 companies around the world.
As with any foreign investment, 
investing in China is not without risk. 
One potential risk facing foreign inves￾tors in China is that the government 
could decide to nationalize private 
companies. Many public companies in 
China are firms that were once owned 
by the communist government, such as 
China Life Insurance Company, and it 
is always possible that the government 
may decide that it wishes to own and 
control these companies again. The list 
of governments similar to China’s that 
have nationalized private companies is 
fairly long. Although there is no evi￾dence that it will happen in China, it 
should be considered one of the risks.

campaigning for foreign investment,

asset, the after-tax proceeds (if any) from the sale of an old asset, and the 
change (if any) in net working capital. Note that if there are no installation 
costs and the firm is not replacing an existing asset, the cost (purchase price) of 
the new asset, adjusted for any change in net working capital, is equal to the 
initial investment.
INSTALLEd COST OF NEW ASSET
As shown in Table 11.1, the installed cost of the new asset is found by adding the 
cost of the new asset to its installation costs. The cost of new asset is the net out￾flow that its acquisition requires. Usually, we are concerned with the acquisition 
of a fixed asset for which a definite purchase price is paid. Installation costs are 
any added costs that are necessary to place an asset into operation. The Internal 
Revenue Service requires the firm to add installation costs to the purchase price 
of an asset to determine its depreciable value, which is expensed over a period of 
years. The installed cost of new asset, calculated by adding the cost of new asset
to its installation costs, equals its depreciable value.
AFTER-TAx PROCEEdS FROM SALE OF OLd ASSET
Table 11.1 shows that the after-tax proceeds from sale of old asset decrease the 
firm’s initial investment in the new asset. These proceeds are the difference be￾tween the old asset’s sale proceeds and any applicable taxes or tax refunds related 
to its sale. The proceeds from sale of old asset are the net cash inflows it provides. 
This amount is net of any costs incurred in the process of removing the asset. In￾cluded in these removal costs are cleanup costs, such as those related to removal 
and disposal of chemical and nuclear wastes. These costs may not be trivial, and 
in some cases they may outweigh any sale proceeds received from the old asset. In 
other words, the net proceeds from selling or disposing of the old asset may be 
positive or negative.
The proceeds from the sale of an old asset are normally subject to some type 
of tax.1
 This tax on sale of old asset depends on the relationship between its sale 
price and book value and on existing government tax rules.

1. A brief discussion of the tax treatment of ordinary and capital gains income was presented in Chapter 2. Because 
corporate capital gains and ordinary income are taxed at the same rate, for convenience we do not differentiate be￾tween them in the following discussions.486 PART 5   Long-Term Investment Decisions
Book Value
The book value of an asset is its strict accounting value. It can be calculated by 
the equation
book value
The strict accounting value of an 
asset, calculated by subtracting 
its accumulated depreciation 
from its installed cost.
Book value = Installed cost of asset - Accumulated depreciation (11.1)
Hudson Industries, a small electronics company, acquired a machine tool 
2 years ago with an installed cost of $100,000. The asset was being depreciated un￾der MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. Table 4.2 (on page 166) shows that 
under MACRS for a 5-year recovery period, 20% and 32% of the installed cost 
would be depreciated in years 1 and 2, respectively. In other words, 52% (20% 1
32%) of the $100,000 cost, or $52,000 (0.52 * $100,000), would represent the ac￾cumulated depreciation at the end of year 2. Substituting into Equation 11.1, we get
Book value 5 $100,000 2 $52,000 5 48,000
The book value of Hudson’s asset at the end of year 2 is therefore $48,000.
Basic Tax Rules
Three potential tax situations can occur when a firm sells an asset. These situa￾tions depend on the relationship between the asset’s sale price and its book value. 
The two key forms of taxable income and their associated tax treatments are de￾fined and summarized in Table 11.2. The assumed tax rates used throughout this 
text are noted in the final column. There are three possible tax situations: The 
asset may be sold (1) for more than its book value, (2) for its book value, or 
(3) for less than its book value. An example will illustrate.
The old asset purchased 2 years ago for $100,000 by Hudson Industries has a cur￾rent book value of $48,000. What will happen if the firm now decides to sell the as￾set and replace it? The tax consequences depend on the sale price. Figure 11.3 depicts 
the taxable income resulting from four possible sale prices in light of the asset’s initial 
purchase price of $100,000 and its current book value of $48,000. The taxable con￾sequences of each of these sale prices are described in the following paragraphs.
The sale of the asset for more than its book value If Hudson sells the old asset 
for $110,000, it realizes a gain of $62,000 ($110,000 2 $48,000). Technically, 
this gain is made up of two parts: a capital gain and recaptured depreciation,

which is the portion of the sale price that is above book value and below the ini￾tial purchase price. For Hudson, the capital gain is $10,000 ($110,000 sale price 
- $100,000 initial purchase price); recaptured depreciation is $52,000 (the 
$100,000 initial purchase price - $48,000 book value).
Both the $10,000 capital gain and the $52,000 recaptured depreciation are 
shown under the $110,000 sale price in Figure 11.3. The total gain above book 
value of $62,000 is taxed as ordinary income at the 40% rate, resulting in taxes 
of $24,800 (0.40 * $62,000). These taxes should be used in calculating the ini￾tial investment in the new asset, using the format in Table 11.1. In effect, the 
taxes raise the amount of the firm’s initial investment in the new asset by reduc￾ing the proceeds from the sale of the old asset.
If Hudson instead sells the old asset for $70,000, it experiences a gain above 
book value (in the form of recaptured depreciation) of $22,000 ($70,000 -
$48,000), as shown under the $70,000 sale price in Figure 11.3. This gain is 
taxed as ordinary income. Because the firm is in the 40% tax bracket, the taxes 
on the $22,000 gain are $8,800 (0.40 * $22,000). This amount in taxes should 
be used in calculating the initial investment in the new asset.
The sale of the asset for its book value If the asset is sold for $48,000, its book 
value, the firm breaks even. There is no gain or loss, as shown under the $48,000 
sale price in Figure 11.3. Because no tax results from selling an asset for its book 
value, there is no tax effect on the initial investment in the new asset.
The sale of the asset for less than its book value If Hudson sells the asset for 
$30,000, it experiences a loss of $18,000 ($48,000 - $30,000), as shown under 
the $30,000 sale price in Figure 11.3. The firm may use the loss to offset ordinary 
operating income if the asset is a depreciable asset used in the business. If the

only to offset capital gains. In either case, the loss will save the firm $7,200 
(0.40 * $18,000) in taxes. And, if current operating earnings or capital gains are 
not sufficient to offset the loss, the firm may be able to apply these losses to prior 
or future years’ taxes.
ChANGE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL
Net working capital is the difference between the firm’s current assets and its current 
liabilities. This topic is treated in depth in Chapter 15; at this point, it is important to 
note that changes in net working capital often accompany capital expenditure 
decisions. If a firm acquires new machinery to expand its level of operations, it will 
experience an increase in levels of cash, accounts receivable, inventories, accounts 
payable, and accruals. These increases result from the need for more cash to support 
expanded operations, more accounts receivable and inventories to support increased 
sales, and more accounts payable and accruals to support increased outlays made to 
meet expanded product demand. As noted in Chapter 4, increases in cash, accounts 
receivable, and inventories are outflows of cash, whereas increases in accounts 
payable and accruals are inflows of cash.

3. When changes in net working capital apply to the initial investment associated with a proposed capital expendi￾ture, they are for convenience assumed to be instantaneous and thereby occurring at time zero. In practice, the change 
in net working capital will frequently occur over a period of months as the capital expenditure is implemented.
Matter of fact
B
ecause, from a firm’s perspective, an increase in working capital is a cash outflow, companies 
around the world work hard to economize on their working capital requirements. A PWC 
study of European companies found that working capital was at an all-time low in 2011.2
 Ac￾cording to the study, the companies that were most efficient in their use of working capital had a 
strong focus on process optimization and worked hard to instill a cash-based culture among their 
employees. In addition, these companies tended to be early adopters of new technologies, which 
facilitated reduced working capital needs.
Europeans Squeeze Working Capital
The difference between the change in current assets and the change in current 
liabilities is the change in net working capital. Generally, when a company makes a 
major new investment, current assets increase by more than current liabilities, re￾sulting in an increased investment in net working capital. This increased investment 
in working capital is treated as an initial outflow.3
 If the change in net working 
capital were negative, it would be shown as an initial inflow. The change in net 
working capital—regardless of whether it is an increase or a decrease—is not tax￾able because it merely involves a net buildup or net reduction of current accounts.
Danson Company, a metal products manufacturer, is contemplating expanding its 
operations. Financial analysts expect that the changes in current accounts summa￾rized in Table 11.3 will occur and will be maintained over the life of the expansion. 
Current assets are expected to increase by $22,000, and current liabilities are 
Example 11.4 ▶
2.“PWC European Working Capital Annual Review” 2012.ChAPTER 11   Capital Budgeting Cash Flows 489
expected to increase by $9,000, resulting in a $13,000 increase in net working 
capital. In this case, the change will represent an increased net working capital in￾vestment and will be treated as a cash outflow in calculating the initial investment.
CALCuLATING ThE INITIAL INVESTMENT
A variety of tax and other considerations enter into the initial investment calcula￾tion. The following example illustrates calculation of the initial investment ac￾cording to the format in Table 11.1.4
Powell Corporation, a large, diversified manufacturer of aircraft components, is try￾ing to determine the initial investment required to replace an old machine with a 
new, more sophisticated model. The proposed machine’s purchase price is $380,000, 
and an additional $20,000 will be necessary to install it. It will be depreciated under 
MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. The present (old) machine was purchased 
3 years ago at a cost of $240,000 and was being depreciated under MACRS using a 
5-year recovery period. The firm has found a buyer willing to pay $280,000 for the 
present machine and to remove it at the buyer’s expense. The firm expects that a 
$35,000 increase in current assets and an $18,000 increase in current liabilities will 
accompany the replacement; these changes will result in a $17,000 ($35,000 -
$18,000) increase in net working capital. The firm pays taxes at a rate of 40%.
The only component of the initial investment calculation that is difficult to 
obtain is taxes. The book value of the present machine can be found by 
using the depreciation percentages from Table 4.2 (on page 166) of 20%, 32%, 
and 19% for years 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The resulting book value is 
$240,000 - 3 (0.20 + 0.32 + 0.19) * $240,0004 , or $69,600. A gain of 
$210,400 ($280,000 - $69,600) is realized on the sale. The total taxes on the gain 
are $84,160 (0.40 * $210,400). These taxes must be subtracted from the $280,000 
sale price of the present machine to calculate the after-tax proceeds from its sale.

4. Throughout the discussions of capital budgeting, all assets evaluated as candidates for replacement are assumed to 
be depreciable assets that are directly used in the business, so any losses on the sale of these assets can be applied 
against ordinary operating income. The decisions are also structured to ensure that the usable life remaining on the 
old asset is just equal to the life of the new asset; this assumption enables us to avoid the problem of unequal lives, 
which is discussed in Chapter 12.490 PART 5   Long-Term Investment Decisions
Substituting the relevant amounts into the format in Table 11.1 results in an 
initial investment of $221,160, which represents the net cash outflow required at

 11.3 Finding the Operating Cash Flows
As the name implies, operating cash flows are the incremental, after-tax cash flows 
that occur after a new investment is made. In this section, we use the income state￾ment format to clarify what we mean by incremental, after-tax cash flows.
INTERPRETING ThE TERM AFTER-TAX
Benefits that result from capital expenditures must be measured on an after-tax 
basis because the firm will not have the use of any benefits until it has satisfied the 
government’s tax claims. These claims depend on the firm’s taxable income, so 
deducting taxes before making comparisons between proposed investments is nec￾essary for consistency when evaluating capital expenditure alternatives.
INTERPRETING ThE TERM CASH FLOWS
All costs and benefits expected from a proposed project must be measured on a 
cash flow basis. Cash outflows represent costs incurred by the firm, and cash in￾flows represent dollars that can be spent by the firm. Cash flows generally are not 
equal to accounting profits. One of the main reasons that accounting profits do 
not equal cash flows is because accounting does not allow firms to fully deduct or 
LG 5ChAPTER 11   Capital Budgeting Cash Flows 491
expense the cost of fixed assets at the time of purchase. Instead, firms expense a 
portion of the cost of fixed assets through depreciation deductions over the useful 
life of the fixed asset. As a result, when a firm pays cash for a fixed asset, the 
firm’s profits will not fully reflect the cost of the asset in the year of purchase. In 
subsequent years, firms reduce their profits by taking depreciation expenses, even 
though there are no cash outlays tied to those depreciation charges.
There is a simple technique for converting after-tax net profits into operating 
cash flows. The calculation requires adding depreciation and any other noncash 
charges (amortization and depletion) deducted as expenses on the firm’s income 
statement back to net profits after taxes. Recognize that depreciation expenses are 
not actually cash inflows themselves. Adding depreciation to profit simply recog￾nizes that the profit calculation requires firms to deduct an expense that is not tied 
to a specific cash outlay. In a sense, adding depreciation to profit “corrects” this is￾sue and provides a number that better matches the actual cash inflows and outflows.
Powell Corporation’s estimates of its revenue and expenses (excluding depreciation 
and interest), with and without the proposed new machine described in Example 
11.5, are given in Table 11.4. Note that both the expected usable life of the proposed 
machine and the remaining usable life of the present machine are 5 years. The amount 
to be depreciated with the proposed machine is calculated by summing the purchase 
price of $380,000 and the installation costs of $20,000. The proposed machine is to 
be depreciated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period.5
 The resulting depre￾ciation on this machine for each of the 6 years, as well as the remaining 3 years of 
depreciation (years 4, 5, and 6) on the present machine, are calculated in Table 11.5.6
The operating cash flows each year can be calculated by using the income 
statement format shown in Table 11.6. Note that we exclude interest because we 
are focusing purely on the “investment decision.” The interest is relevant to the 
“financing decision,” which is separately considered. Because we exclude interest 
expense, “earnings before interest and taxes” (EBIT) is equivalent to “net profits 
before taxes,” and the calculation of “operating cash flow” (OCF) in Table 11.6 is

5. As noted in Chapter 4, it takes n 1 1 years to depreciate an n-year class asset under current tax law. Therefore, 
MACRS percentages are given for each of 6 years for use in depreciating an asset with a 5-year recovery period.
6. It is important to recognize that although both machines will provide 5 years of use, the proposed new machine 
will be depreciated over the 6-year period, whereas the present machine, as noted in the preceding example, has been 
depreciated over 3 years and therefore has remaining only its final 3 years (years 4, 5, and 6) of depreciation (12%, 
12%, and 5%, respectively, under MACRS).492 PART 5   Long-Term Investment Decisions
identical to the definition that we provided in Chapter 4 (defined in Equation 4.3, 
on page 171). Simply stated, the income statement format calculates the OCF.

performed over the 6-year period to capture fully the tax effect of its year-6 depre￾ciation. The resulting operating cash flows appear in the final row of Table 11.7 
for each machine. The $8,000 year-6 operating cash inflow for the proposed ma￾chine results solely from the tax benefit of its year-6 depreciation deduction.7
INTERPRETING ThE TERM INCREMENTAL
The final step in estimating the operating cash flows for a proposed replacement 
project is to calculate the incremental (relevant) cash flows. Incremental operat￾ing cash flows are needed because our concern is only with the change in operating 
cash flows that result from the proposed project. Clearly, if it were an expansion 
project, the project’s cash flows would be the incremental cash flows.494 PART 5   Long-Term Investment Decisions
Table 11.8 demonstrates the calculation of Powell Corporation’s incremental 
(relevant) operating cash flows for each year. The estimates of operating cash 
flows developed in Table 11.7 appear in columns 1 and 2. Column 2 values rep￾resent the amount of operating cash flows that Powell Corporation will receive if 
it does not replace the present machine. If the proposed machine replaces the 
present machine, the firm’s operating cash flows for each year will be those 
shown in column 1. Subtracting the present machine’s operating cash flows from 
the proposed machine’s operating cash flows, we get the incremental operating 
cash flows for each year, shown in column 3. These cash flows represent the 
amounts by which each respective year’s cash flows will increase as a result of the 
replacement. For example, in year 1, Powell Corporation’s cash flows would in￾crease by $26,480 if the proposed project were undertaken. Clearly, these are the 
relevant inflows to be considered when evaluating the benefits of making a capi￾tal expenditure for the proposed machine.8
Example 11.7 ▶
8. The following equation can be used to calculate more directly the incremental cash flow in year t, ICIt
:
ICIt = [∆EBDITt * (1 - T)] + (∆Dt * T)
where
∆EBDITt = change in earnings before depreciation, interest, and taxes [revenues – expenses 
(excl. depr. and int.)] in year t
T = firm’s marginal tax rate
∆Dt = change in depreciation expense in year t
Applying this formula to the Powell Corporation data given in Tables 11.4 and 11.5 for year 3, we get the following 
values of variables:
∆EBDIT3 = ($2,520,000 - $2,300,000) - ($2,400,000 - $2,230,000)
= $220,000 - $170,000 = $50,000
∆D3 = $76,000 - $12,000 = $64,000
T = 0.40
Substituting into the equation yields
ICI3 = [$50,000 * (1 - 0.40)] + ($64,000 * 0.40)
= $30,000 + $25,600 = $55,600
The $55,600 of incremental cash inflow for year 3 is the same value as that calculated for year 3 in column 3 of 
Table 11.8.

flows? How does the income statement format in Table 11.6 relate to 
Equation 4.3 (on page 171) for finding operating cash flow (OCF)?
11–10 How are the incremental (relevant) operating cash flows that are associ￾ated with a replacement decision calculated?
 11.4 Finding the Terminal Cash Flow
Terminal cash flow is the cash flow resulting from termination and liquidation of 
a project at the end of its economic life. It represents the after-tax cash flow, ex￾clusive of operating cash flows, that occurs in the final year of the project. When 
it applies, this flow can significantly affect the capital expenditure decision. Ter￾minal cash flow can be calculated for replacement projects by using the basic 
format presented in Table 11.9.
PROCEEdS FROM SALE OF ASSETS
The proceeds from sale of the new and the old asset, often called “salvage value,” 
represent the amount net of any removal or cleanup costs expected on termina￾tion of the project. For replacement projects, proceeds from both the new asset 
and the old asset must be considered. For expansion and renewal types of capital 
expenditures, the proceeds from the old asset are zero. Of course, it is not un￾usual for the value of an asset to be zero at the termination of a project.
TAxES ON SALE OF ASSETS
When the investment being analyzed involves replacing an old asset with a new 
one, there are two key elements in finding the terminal cash flow. First, at the end 
of the project’s life, the firm will dispose of the new asset, possibly by selling it, so 
the after-tax proceeds from selling the new asset represent a cash inflow. How￾ever, remember that if the firm had not replaced the old asset, the firm would 
have received proceeds from sale of the old asset at the end of the project (rather 
than counting those proceeds up front as part of the initial investment). There￾fore, we must count as a cash outflow the after-tax proceeds that the firm would

have received from disposal of the old asset. Taxes come into play whenever an 
asset is sold for a value different from its book value. If the net proceeds from the 
sale are expected to exceed book value, a tax payment shown as an outflow (de￾duction from sale proceeds) will occur. When the net proceeds from the sale are 
less than book value, a tax benefit shown as a cash inflow (addition to sale pro￾ceeds) will result. For assets sold to net exactly book value, no taxes will be due.
ChANGE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL
When we calculated the initial investment, we took into account any change in 
net working capital that is attributable to the new asset. Now, when we calculate 
the terminal cash flow, the change in net working capital represents the reversion 
of any initial net working capital investment. Most often, this will show up as a 
cash inflow due to the reduction in net working capital; with termination of the 
project, the need for the increased net working capital investment is assumed to 
end.9
 Because the net working capital investment is in no way consumed, the 
amount recovered at termination will equal the amount shown in the calculation 
of the initial investment. Tax considerations are not involved.
Calculating the terminal cash flow involves the same procedures as those 
used to find the initial investment. In the following example, the terminal cash 
flow is calculated for a replacement decision.
Continuing with the Powell Corporation example, assume that the firm expects to 
be able to liquidate the new machine at the end of its 5-year usable life to net 
$50,000 after paying removal and cleanup costs. Had it not been replaced by the 
new machine, the old machine would have been liquidated at the end of the 
5 years to net $10,000. The firm expects to recover its $17,000 net working capital 
investment upon termination of the project. The firm pays taxes at a rate of 40%.
From the analysis of the operating cash flows presented earlier, we can see 
that the proposed (new) machine will have a book value of $20,000 (equal to the 
year-6 depreciation) at the end of 5 years. The present (old) machine would have 
been fully depreciated and therefore would have a book value of zero at the end 
of the 5 years. Because the sale price of $50,000 for the proposed (new) machine 
is below its initial installed cost of $400,000 but greater than its book value of 
$20,000, taxes will have to be paid only on the recaptured depreciation of 
$30,000 ($50,000 sale proceeds - $20,000 book value). Applying the ordinary 
tax rate of 40% to this $30,000 results in a tax of $12,000 (0.40 * $30,000) on 
the sale of the proposed machine. Its after-tax sale proceeds would therefore 
equal $38,000 ($50,000 sale proceeds - $12,000 taxes). Because the old ma￾chine would have been sold for $10,000 at termination, which is less than its 
original purchase price of $240,000 and above its book value of zero, it would 
have experienced a taxable gain of $10,000 ($10,000 sale price - $0 book value). 
Applying the 40% tax rate to the $10,000 gain, the firm would have owed a tax 
of $4,000 (0.40 * $10,000) on the sale of the old machine at the end of year 5. 
Its after-tax sale proceeds from the old machine would have equaled $6,000 
($10,000 sale price - $4,000 taxes). Substituting the appropriate values into the 
format in Table 11.9 results in the terminal cash inflow of $49,000.

 11.5 Summarizing the Relevant Cash Flows
The initial investment, operating cash flows, and terminal cash flow together 
represent a project’s relevant cash flows. These cash flows can be viewed as the 
incremental after-tax cash flows attributable to the proposed project. They repre￾sent, in a cash flow sense, how much better or worse off the firm will be if it 
chooses to implement the proposal.
The relevant cash flows for Powell Corporation’s proposed replacement expendi￾ture can be shown graphically, on a time line. Note that because the new asset is 
assumed to be sold at the end of its 5-year usable life, the year-6 incremental op￾erating cash inflow calculated in Table 11.8 has no relevance; the terminal cash 
flow effectively replaces this value in the analysis.
Example 11.9 ▶
With these cash flow estimates in hand, a financial manager could then cal￾culate the investment’s NPV or IRR using the techniques covered in Chapter 10.

After receiving a sizable bonus from her employer, Tina Talor 
is contemplating the purchase of a new car. She believes that 
by estimating and analyzing the cash flows, she could make a more rational deci￾sion about whether to make this large purchase. Tina’s cash flow estimates for 
the car purchase are as follows:
Negotiated price of new car $23,500
Taxes and fees on new car purchase $ 1,650
Proceeds from sale of old car $ 9,750
Estimated value of new car in 3 years $10,500
Estimated value of old car in 3 years $ 5,700
Estimated annual repair costs on new car 0 (in warranty)
Estimated annual repair costs on old car $ 400
Using the cash flow estimates, Tina calculates the initial investment, operating 
cash flows, terminal cash flow, and a summary of all cash flows for the car purchase.

The cash flows associated with Tina’s car purchase decision reflect her net 
costs of the new car over the assumed 3-year ownership period, but they ignore 
the many intangible benefits of owning a car. Whereas the fuel cost and basic 
transportation service provided are assumed to be the same with the new car as 
with the old car, Tina will have to decide if the cost of moving up to a new car 
can be justified in terms of intangibles, such as luxury and prestige.

for a capital budgeting project.
Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
A key responsibility of financial managers is to review and analyze proposed 
investment decisions to make sure that the firm undertakes only those that 
contribute positively to the value of the firm. Using a variety of tools and tech￾niques, financial managers estimate the cash flows that a proposed investment 
will generate and then apply decision techniques to assess the investment’s im￾pact on the firm’s value. The most difficult and important aspect of this capi￾tal budgeting process is developing good estimates of the relevant cash flows.
The relevant cash flows are the incremental after-tax cash flows resulting 
from a proposed investment. These estimates represent the cash flow benefits 
that are likely to accrue to the firm as a result of implementing the investment. 
By applying to the cash flows decision techniques that capture the time value of 
money and risk factors, the financial manager can estimate how the investment 
will affect the firm’s share price. Consistent application of capital budgeting 
procedures to proposed long-term investments should therefore allow the firm 
to maximize its stock price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
LG 1 Discuss the three major cash flow components. The three major cash 
flow components of any project can include (1) an initial investment, (2) operat￾ing cash flows, and (3) terminal cash flow. The initial investment occurs at time 
zero, the operating cash flows occur during the project’s life, and the terminal 
cash flow occurs at the end of the project.
LG 2 Discuss relevant cash flows, expansion versus replacement decisions, sunk 
costs and opportunity costs, and international capital budgeting. The relevant 
cash flows for capital budgeting decisions are the initial investment, the operating 
cash flows, and the terminal cash flow. For replacement decisions, these flows are 
the difference between the cash flows of the new asset and the old asset. Expan￾sion decisions are viewed as replacement decisions in which all cash flows from 
the old asset are zero. When estimating relevant cash flows, ignore sunk costs 
and include opportunity costs as cash outflows. In international capital budget￾ing, currency risks and political risks can be minimized through careful planning.
LG 3 Calculate the initial investment associated with a proposed capital expen￾diture. The initial investment is the initial outflow required, taking into account 
the installed cost of the new asset, the after-tax proceeds from the sale of the old 
asset, and any change in net working capital. The initial investment is reduced 
by finding the after-tax proceeds from sale of the old asset. The book value of an 500 PART 5   Long-Term Investment Decisions
asset is used to determine the taxes owed as a result of its sale. Either of two 
forms of taxable income—a gain or a loss—can result from sale of an asset, 
depending on whether the asset is sold for (1) more than book value, (2) book 
value, or (3) less than book value. The change in net working capital is the dif￾ference between the change in current assets and the change in current liabilities 
expected to accompany a given capital expenditure.
LG 4 Discuss the tax implications associated with the sale of an old asset.
There is typically a tax implication from the sale of an old asset. The tax impli￾cation depends on the relationship between its sale price and book value and on 
existing government tax rules. Generally, if the old asset is sold for an amount 
greater than its book value, the difference is subject to a capital gains tax, and if 
the old asset is sold for an amount less than its book value, the company is enti￾tled to a tax deduction equal to the difference.
LG 5
Find the relevant operating cash flows associated with a proposed capital 
expenditure. The operating cash flows are the incremental after-tax cash flows 
expected to result from a project. The income statement format involves adding 
depreciation back to net operating profit after taxes and gives the operating cash 
inflows, which are the same as operating cash flows (OCF), associated with the 
proposed and present projects. The relevant (incremental) cash flows for a re￾placement project are the difference between the operating cash flows of the 
proposed project and those of the present project.
LG 6 Determine the terminal cash flow associated with a proposed capital ex￾penditure. The terminal cash flow represents the after-tax cash flow (exclusive 
of operating cash inflows) that is expected from liquidation of a project. It is 
calculated for replacement projects by finding the difference between the after￾tax proceeds from sale of the new and the old asset at termination and then ad￾justing this difference for any change in net working capital. Sale price and de￾preciation data are used to find the taxes and the after-tax sale proceeds on the 
new and old assets. The change in net working capital typically represents the 
reversion of any initial net working capital investment.
Opener-in-Review
The chapter opener talked about Diamond Comic Distributor’s attempt to re￾duce the cost of opening a retail comic book store. Suppose that the current cost 
of opening such a store is $400,000 and that $250,000 of that initial investment 
is the cost of stocking the shelves with new inventory. Suppose also that the an￾nual operating cash inflow from running an average comic book store is about 
$62,000 before taxes and that the tax rate is 35%.
a. Assuming that the average comic book store has a life of about 10 years, what is 
the NPV of opening a new store if the required rate of return in this business is 
10%? You may assume that the $250,000 in initial inventory will be recovered 
at the end of the tenth year (in addition to the annual operating cash flow for 
that year). What is the IRR that one can earn by opening up a new store?ChAPTER 11   Capital Budgeting Cash Flows 501
b. Assume that by offering merchandise discounts to customers who are opening 
new stores Diamond can reduce the required initial inventory investment from 
$250,000 to $150,000. Maintaining all other assumptions as previously stated, 
how will that affect the NPV and IRR earned on a new comic book store?
Self-Test Problems  (Solutions in Appendix)
 ST11–1 Book value, taxes, and initial investment Irvin Enterprises is considering the pur￾chase of a new piece of equipment to replace the current equipment. The new equip￾ment costs $75,000 and requires $5,000 in installation costs. It will be depreciated 
under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. The old piece of equipment was pur￾chased 4 years ago for an installed cost of $50,000; it was being depreciated under 
MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. The old equipment can be sold today for 
$55,000 net of any removal or cleanup costs. As a result of the proposed replace￾ment, the firm’s investment in net working capital is expected to increase by 
$15,000. The firm pays taxes at a rate of 40%. (Table 4.2 on page 166 contains the 
applicable MACRS depreciation percentages.)
a. Calculate the book value of the old piece of equipment.
b. Determine the taxes, if any, attributable to the sale of the old equipment.
c. Find the initial investment associated with the proposed equipment replacement.
 ST11–2 Determining relevant cash flows A machine currently in use was originally pur￾chased 2 years ago for $40,000. The machine is being depreciated under MACRS 
using a 5-year recovery period; it has 3 years of usable life remaining. The current 
machine can be sold today to net $42,000 after removal and cleanup costs. A new 
machine, using a 3-year MACRS recovery period, can be purchased at a price of 
$140,000. It requires $10,000 to install and has a 3-year usable life. If the new ma￾chine is acquired, the investment in accounts receivable will be expected to rise by 
$10,000, the inventory investment will increase by $25,000, and accounts payable 
will increase by $15,000. Earnings before depreciation, interest, and taxes are ex￾pected to be $70,000 for each of the next 3 years with the old machine and to be 
$120,000 in the first year and $130,000 in the second and third years with the new 
machine. At the end of 3 years, the market value of the old machine will equal zero, 
but the new machine could be sold to net $35,000 before taxes. The firm is subject 
to a 40% tax rate. (Table 4.2 on page 166 contains the applicable MACRS deprecia￾tion percentages.)
a. Determine the initial investment associated with the proposed replacement 
decision.
b. Calculate the incremental operating cash flows for years 1 to 4 associated with 
the proposed replacement. (Note: Only depreciation cash flows must be consid￾ered in year 4.)
c. Calculate the terminal cash flow associated with the proposed replacement deci￾sion. (Note: This decision is made at the end of year 3.)
d. Depict on a time line the relevant cash flows found in parts a, b, and c that are 
associated with the proposed replacement decision, assuming that it is terminated 
at the end of year 3.

b. A new machine with an installed cost of $85,000. Sale of the old machine will 
yield $30,000 after taxes. Operating cash inflows generated by the replacement 
will exceed the operating cash inflows of the old machine by $20,000 in each year 
of a 6-year period. At the end of year 6, liquidation of the new machine will yield 
$20,000 after taxes, which is $10,000 greater than the after-tax proceeds expected 
from the old machine had it been retained and liquidated at the end of year 6.
c. An asset that requires an initial investment of $2 million and will yield annual 
operating cash inflows of $300,000 for each of the next 10 years. Operating cash 
outlays will be $20,000 for each year except year 6, when an overhaul requiring 
an additional cash outlay of $500,000 will be required. The asset’s liquidation 
value at the end of year 10 is expected to be zero.

 P11–4 Sunk costs and opportunity costs Masters Golf Products, Inc., spent 3 years and 
$1,000,000 to develop its new line of club heads to replace a line that is becoming ob￾solete. To begin manufacturing them, the company will have to invest $1,800,000 in 
new equipment. The new clubs are expected to generate an increase in operating cash 
inflows of $750,000 per year for the next 10 years. The company has determined that 
the existing line could be sold to a competitor for $250,000.
a. How should the $1,000,000 in development costs be classified?

LG 2504 PART 5   Long-Term Investment Decisions
b. Covol would be able to use its existing computer system to develop programs for 
operating the new machine tool. The old machine tool did not require these pro￾grams. Although the firm’s computer has excess capacity available, the capacity 
could be leased to another firm for an annual fee of $17,000.
c. Covol would have to obtain additional floor space to accommodate the larger 
new machine tool. The space that would be used is currently being leased to an￾other company for $10,000 per year.
d. Covol would use a small storage facility to store the increased output of the new 
machine tool. The storage facility was built by Covol 3 years earlier at a cost of 
$120,000. Because of its unique configuration and location, it is currently of no 
use to either Covol or any other firm.
e. Covol would retain an existing overhead crane, which it had planned to sell for 
its $180,000 market value. Although the crane was not needed with the old ma￾chine tool, it would be used to position raw materials on the new machine tool.

 P11–20 Determining incremental operating cash inflows Scenic Tours, Inc., is a provider 
of bus tours throughout New England. The corporation is considering the replace￾ment of ten of its older buses. The existing buses were purchased 4 years ago at a 
total cost of $2,700,000 and are being depreciated using MACRS and a 5-year re￾covery period (see Table 4.2 page 166). The new buses would have larger passen￾ger capacity and better fuel efficiency as well as lower maintenance costs. The total 
cost for ten new buses is $3,000,000. Like the older buses, the new ones would be 
depreciated using MACRS and a 5-year recovery period. Scenic is subject to a tax 
rate of 40%. The accompanying table presents revenues and cash expenses (ex￾cluding depreciation and interest) for the proposed purchase as well as the present 
fleet. Use all the information given to calculate incremental (relevant) operating

require $30,000 in installation costs. It will be depreciated under MACRS using a 
5-year recovery period (see Table 4.2 on page 166 for the applicable depreciation 
percentages). A $25,000 increase in net working capital will be required to sup￾port the new machine. The firm’s managers plan to evaluate the potential replace￾ment over a 4-year period. They estimate that the old machine could be sold at the 
end of 4 years to net $15,000 before taxes; the new machine at the end of 4 years

would be depreciated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. Lombard can 
currently sell the existing grinder for $70,000 without incurring any removal or 
cleanup costs. To support the increased business resulting from purchase of the new 
grinder, accounts receivable would increase by $40,000, inventories by $30,000, and 
accounts payable by $58,000. At the end of 5 years, the existing grinder would have

 P11–27 Integrative: Determining relevant cash flows Atlantic Drydock is considering replac￾ing an existing hoist with one of two newer, more efficient pieces of equipment. The 
existing hoist is 3 years old, cost $32,000, and is being depreciated under MACRS 
using a 5-year recovery period. Although the existing hoist has only 3 years (years 4, 
5, and 6) of depreciation remaining under MACRS, it has a remaining usable life of 
5 years. Hoist A, one of the two possible replacement hoists, costs $40,000 to pur￾chase and $8,000 to install. It has a 5-year usable life and will be depreciated under 
MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. Hoist B costs $54,000 to purchase and 
$6,000 to install. It also has a 5-year usable life and will be depreciated under 
MACRS using a 5-year recovery period.
Increased investments in net working capital will accompany the decision to ac￾quire hoist A or hoist B. Purchase of hoist A would result in a $4,000 increase in net 
working capital; hoist B would result in a $6,000 increase in net working capital. 
The projected earnings before depreciation, interest, and taxes with each alternative 
hoist and the existing hoist are given in the following table.

before taxes. It is 2 years old, cost $800,000 new, and has a $384,000 book value 
and a remaining useful life of 5 years. It was being depreciated under MACRS using 
a 5-year recovery period (see Table 4.2 on page 166) and therefore has the final 
4 years of depreciation remaining. If it is held for 5 more years, the machine’s mar￾ket value at the end of year 5 will be $0. Over its 5-year life, the new machine 
should reduce operating costs by $350,000 per year. The new machine will be

cash flows, how to compare projects with unequal lives, and how to measure 
project returns when capital is being rationed.
informAtion SYStemS You need to understand how risk is incorporated 
into capital budgeting techniques and how those techniques may be refined in 
the face of special circumstances so as to design decision modules for use in 
analyzing proposed capital projects.
mAnAgement You need to understand behavioral approaches for dealing 
with risk, including international risk, in capital budgeting decisions; how to 
risk-adjust discount rates; how to refine capital budgeting techniques when 
projects have unequal lives or when capital must be rationed; and how to 
recognize real options embedded in capital projects.
mArketing You need to understand how the risk of proposed projects is 
measured in capital budgeting, how projects with unequal lives will be 
evaluated, how to recognize and treat real options embedded in proposed 
projects, and how projects will be evaluated when capital must be rationed.
operAtionS You need to understand how proposals for the acquisition of new 
equipment and plants will be evaluated by the firm’s decision makers, especially 
projects that are risky, have unequal lives, or may need to be abandoned or 
slowed, or when capital is limited.
In your personal life risk is present in all long-term decisions. 
When making personal financial decisions, 
you should consider risk in the decision-making process. Simply put, you should 
demand higher returns for greater risk. failing to incorporate risk into your 
financial decision-making process will likely result in poor decisions and 
reduced wealth.516
Argentina Seizes Oil Company from 
Spanish Owners
Y
PF is the largest oil company in Argentina. After 
operating for more than 70 years as a state￾owned enterprise, YPF was privatized in 1993 and 
later purchased by the Spanish firm, Repsol S.A. In the 
purchase agreement, the government of Argentina re￾tained a “golden share,” essentially giving the govern￾ment the right to outvote all other shareholders on 
certain matters.
After Repsol’s acquisition of YPF, the Argentinian company’s production faltered. In 2011, 
Argentina reported a deficit in international energy trade for the first time in almost 15 years (mean￾ing that it imported more energy than it exported). Government officials began to point fingers at 
Repsol, accusing the company of mismanaging YPF and underinvesting in exploration and produc￾tion in Argentina. Governors in several provinces revoked Repsol’s leases, an action that contributed 
to a 50% decline in YPF shares from February to early April. Finally, on April 16, 2012, Argentina’s 
president, Cristina Kirchner, announced that her country would sieze a majority state in YPF from 
Repsol, essentially expropriating the firm’s assets from Repsol. Repsol would receive some compensa￾tion in exchange for their YPF shares, but company officials insisted that the compensation they were 
offered was far below the value of the assets that had been seized.
A little more than a year later, Chevron Corp. announced that it would fund most of a 
$1.5 billion joint venture with YPF to develop the country’s shale oil and gas deposits. Commentators 
noted that in making such a large investment in Argentina, Chevron was demonstrating its willing￾ness to take on not only the inherent risks associated with oil and gas exploration, but also the 
political risks of doing business in Argentina.
When firms undertake major investments, they cannot avoid taking risks. These risks may 
arise from the nature of the business that a company operates in, such as the risks of oil exploration, 
but political factors can also create risks that may diminish the value of a company’s investments. 
This chapter focuses on the tools available to managers that help them better understand the risks of 
major investments.
YPFChAPTER 12   Risk and Refinements in Capital Budgeting 517
 12.1 Introduction to Risk in Capital 
Budgeting
In our discussion of capital budgeting thus far, we have assumed that a firm’s 
investment projects all have the same risk, which implies that the acceptance of 
any project would not change the firm’s overall risk. In actuality, these assump￾tions often do not hold: Projects are not equally risky, and the acceptance of a 
project can increase or decrease the firm’s overall risk. We begin this chapter by 
relaxing these assumptions and focusing on how managers evaluate the risks of 
different projects. Naturally, we will use many of the risk concepts developed in 
Chapter 8.
We continue the Bennett Company example from Chapter 10. The relevant 
cash flows and NPVs for Bennett Company’s two mutually exclusive projects—A 
and B—appear in Table 12.1.
In the following three sections, we use the basic risk concepts presented in 
Chapter 8 to demonstrate behavioral approaches for dealing with risk, interna￾tional risk considerations, and the use of risk-adjusted discount rates to explicitly 
recognize risk in the analysis of capital budgeting projects.
➔ REVIEW QuESTION
12–1 Are most mutually exclusive capital budgeting projects equally risky? 
If you think about a firm as a portfolio of many different kinds 
of investments, how can the acceptance of a project change a firm’s 
overall risk?

 12.2 Behavioral Approaches for dealing with Risk
Behavioral approaches can be used to get a “feel” for the level of project risk, 
whereas other approaches try to quantify and measure project risk. Here we pres￾ent a few behavioral approaches for dealing with risk in capital budgeting: 
breakeven analysis, scenario analysis, and simulation.
BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS
In the context of capital budgeting, the term risk refers to the uncertainty sur￾rounding the cash flows that a project will generate. More formally, risk in capi￾tal budgeting is the degree of variability of cash flows. Projects with a broad 
range of possible cash flows are more risky than projects that have a narrow 
range of possible cash flows.
In many projects, risk stems almost entirely from the cash flows that a proj￾ect will generate several years in the future because the initial investment is gener￾ally known with relative certainty. The subsequent cash flows, of course, derive 
from a number of variables related to revenues, expenditures, and taxes. Exam￾ples include the level of sales, the cost of raw materials, labor rates, utility costs, 
and tax rates. We will concentrate on the risk in the cash flows, but remember 
that this risk actually results from the interaction of these underlying variables. 
Therefore, to assess the risk of a proposed capital expenditure, the analyst needs 
to evaluate the probability that the cash inflows will be large enough to produce 
a positive NPV.
Treadwell Tire Company, a tire retailer with a 10% cost of capital, is considering 
investing in either of two mutually exclusive projects, A and B. Each requires a 
$10,000 initial investment, and both are expected to provide constant annual 
cash inflows over their 15-year lives. For either project to be acceptable, its NPV 
must be greater than zero. In other words, the present value of the annuity (that 
is, the project’s cash inflows) must be greater than the initial cash outflow. If we 
let CF equal the annual cash inflow and CF0
 equal the initial investment, the fol￾lowing condition must be met for projects with annuity cash inflows, such as A 
and B, to be acceptable:1

The calculator and spreadsheet values indicate that, for the projects to be ac￾ceptable, they must have annual cash inflows of at least $1,315. Given this break￾even level of cash inflows, the risk of each project can be assessed by determining 
the probability that the project’s cash inflows will equal or exceed this breakeven 
level. The various statistical techniques that would determine that probability are 
covered in more advanced courses.2
 For now, we can simply assume that such a 
statistical analysis results in the following:
Probability of CFA 7 $1,315 S 100,
Probability of CFB 7 $1,315 S 65,
Because project A is certain (100% probability) to have a positive net present 
value, whereas there is only a 65% chance that project B will have a positive 
NPV, project A seems less risky than project B. Of course, the expected level of 
annual cash inflow and NPV associated with each project must be evaluated in 
view of the firm’s risk preference before the preferred project is selected.
The example clearly identifies risk as it is related to the chance that a project 
is acceptable, but it does not address the issue of cash flow variability. Even 
though project B has a greater chance of loss than project A, it might result in 
higher potential NPVs. Recall that it is the combination of risk and return that 
determines value. Similarly, the benefit of a capital expenditure and its impact on 
the firm’s value must be viewed in light of both risk and return. The analyst must 
therefore consider the variability of cash inflows and NPVs to assess project risk 
and return fully.
SCENARIO ANALYSIS
Scenario analysis can be used to deal with project risk to capture the variability of 
cash inflows and NPVs. Scenario analysis is a behavioral approach that uses sev￾eral possible alternative outcomes (scenarios) to obtain a sense of the variability 
of returns, measured here by NPV. This technique is often useful in getting a feel 
for the variability of return in response to changes in a key outcome. In capital

budgeting, one of the most common scenario approaches is to estimate the NPVs 
associated with pessimistic (worst), most likely (expected), and optimistic (best) 
estimates of cash inflow. The range can be determined by subtracting the pessi￾mistic-outcome NPV from the optimistic-outcome NPV.
Continuing with Treadwell Tire Company, assume that the financial manager 
created three scenarios for each project: pessimistic, most likely, and optimistic. 
The cash inflows and resulting NPVs in each case are summarized in Table 12.2. 
Comparing the ranges of cash inflows ($1,000 for project A and $4,000 for B) 
and, more important, the ranges of NPVs ($7,606 for project A and $30,424 for 
B) makes it clear that project A is less risky than project B. Given that both proj￾ects have the same most likely NPV of $5,212, the assumed risk-averse decision 
maker will take project A because it has less risk (smaller NPV range) and no 
possibility of loss (all NPVs . $0).
The widespread availability of computers and spreadsheets has greatly en￾hanced the use of scenario analysis because technology allows analysts to create a 
wide range of different scenarios quickly.

repeating the process numerous times, the financial manager can develop a prob￾ability distribution of project returns.
Figure 12.1 presents a flowchart of the simulation of the net present value of 
a project. The process of generating random numbers and using the probability 
distributions for cash inflows and cash outflows enables the financial manager to 
determine values for each of these variables. Substituting these values into the 
mathematical model results in an NPV. By repeating this process perhaps a thou￾sand times, managers can create a probability distribution of net present values.
Although Figure 12.1 simulates only gross cash inflows and cash outflows, 
more sophisticated simulations using individual inflow and outflow components, 
such as sales volume, sale price, raw material cost, labor cost, and maintenance 
expense, are quite common. From the distribution of returns, the decision 
maker can determine not only the expected value of the return but also the 
probability of achieving or surpassing a given return. The use of computers has 
made the simulation approach feasible. Monte Carlo simulation programs, 
made popular by widespread use of personal computers, are described in the 
Focus on Practice box.
The output of simulation provides an excellent basis for decision making 
because it enables the decision maker to view a continuum of risk–return trade￾offs rather than a single-point estimate.

 12.3 International Risk Considerations
Although the basic techniques of capital budgeting are the same for multinational 
companies (MNCs) as for purely domestic firms, firms that operate in several 
countries face risks that are unique to the international arena. Two types of 
risk—exchange rate risk and political risk—are particularly important.
LG 3
Most capital budgeting 
decisions involve some 
degree of uncertainty. For example, a 
company faces some degree of uncer￾tainty associated with the demand for a 
new product. One method of account￾ing for this uncertainty is to average the 
highest and the lowest prediction of 
sales. However, such a method is 
flawed. Producing the average of the 
expected possible demand can lead to 
gross overproduction or gross underpro￾duction, neither of which is as profitable 
as having the right volume of production.
To combat uncertainty in the deci￾sion-making process, some companies 
use a Monte Carlo simulation program 
to model possible outcomes. Developed 
by mathematicians in World War II 
while working on the atomic bomb, the 
Monte Carlo method was not widely 
used until the advent of the personal 
computer. A Monte Carlo simulation

The Monte Carlo Method: The Forecast Is for Less Uncertainty
One of the problems with using a 
Monte Carlo program is the difficulty of 
establishing the correct input ranges for 
the variables and determining the corre￾lation coefficients for those variables. 
However, the work put into developing 
the input for the program can often clar￾ify some uncertainty in a proposed proj￾ect. Although Monte Carlo simulation is 
not the perfect answer to capital bud￾geting problems, it is another tool that 
corporations, including ALCOA, Motor￾ola, Intel, Procter & Gamble, and Walt 
Disney, use to manage risk and make 
more informed business and strategic 
decisions.

requires the user to first build an Ex￾cel spreadsheet model that captures 
the input variables for the proposed 
project. What issues and what bene￾fits can the user derive from this 
process?
program randomly generates values for 
uncertain variables over and over to 
simulate a model. The simulation then 
requires project practitioners to develop 
low, high, and most likely cost estimates 
along with correlation coefficients. 
Once these inputs are derived, the 
Monte Carlo program can be run 
through just a few simulations, or thou￾sands, in just a few seconds.
A Monte Carlo program usually 
builds a histogram of the results, 
referred to as a frequency chart, for 
each forecast or output cell that the user 
wants to analyze. The program then 
delivers a percentage likelihood that a 
particular forecast will fall within a spec￾ified range, much like a weather fore￾cast. The program also has an optimi￾zation feature that allows a project 
manager with budget constraints to fig￾ure out which combination of possible 
projects will result in the highest profit.ChAPTER 12   Risk and Refinements in Capital Budgeting 523
Exchange rate risk reflects the danger that an unexpected change in the ex￾change rate between the dollar and the currency in which a project’s cash flows 
are denominated will reduce the market value of that project’s cash flow. The 
dollar value of future cash inflows can be dramatically altered if the local cur￾rency depreciates against the dollar. In the short term, specific cash flows can be 
hedged by using financial instruments such as currency futures and options. 
Long-term exchange rate risk can best be minimized by financing the project, in 
whole or in part, in local currency.
Political risk is much harder to protect against. Firms that make investments 
abroad may find that the host-country government can limit the firm’s ability to 
return profits back home. Governments can seize the firm’s assets or otherwise 
interfere with a project’s operation. The difficulties of managing political risk after 
the fact make it even more important that managers account for political risks be￾fore making an investment. They can do so either by adjusting a project’s expected 
cash inflows to account for the probability of political interference or by using 
risk-adjusted discount rates (discussed later in this chapter) in capital budgeting 
formulas. In general, it is much better to adjust individual project cash flows for 
political risk subjectively than to use a blanket adjustment for all projects.
In addition to unique risks that MNCs must face, several other special issues 
are relevant only for international capital budgeting. One of these special issues is 
taxes. Because only after-tax cash flows are relevant for capital budgeting, finan￾cial managers must carefully account for taxes paid to foreign governments on 
profits earned within their borders. They must also assess the impact of these tax 
payments on the parent company’s U.S. tax liability.
Another special issue in international capital budgeting is transfer pricing.
Much of the international trade involving MNCs is, in reality, simply the shipment 
of goods and services from one of a parent company’s subsidiaries to another sub￾sidiary located abroad. The parent company therefore has discretion in setting 
transfer prices, the prices that subsidiaries charge each other for the goods and 
services traded between them. The widespread use of transfer pricing in interna￾tional trade makes capital budgeting in MNCs very difficult unless the transfer 
prices that are used accurately reflect actual costs and incremental cash flows.
Finally, MNCs often must approach international capital projects from a stra￾tegic point of view, rather than from a strictly financial perspective. For example, 
an MNC may feel compelled to invest in a country to ensure continued access, 
even if the project itself may not have a positive net present value. This motivation 
was important for Japanese automakers that set up assembly plants in the United 
States in the early 1980s. For much the same reason, U.S. investment in Europe 
surged during the years before the market integration of the European Community 
in 1992. MNCs often invest in production facilities in the home country of major 
rivals to deny these competitors an uncontested home market. MNCs also may 
feel compelled to invest in certain industries or countries to achieve a broad corpo￾rate objective such as completing a product line or diversifying raw material 
sources, even when the project’s cash flows may not be sufficiently profitable.

LG 12.4 4 Risk-Adjusted discount Rates
The approaches for dealing with risk that have been presented so far enable the 
financial manager to get a “feel” for project risk. Unfortunately, they do not ex￾plicitly recognize project risk. We will now illustrate the most popular risk￾adjustment technique that employs the net present value (NPV) decision method. 
The NPV decision rule of accepting only those projects with NPVs 7 $0 will 
continue to hold. Close examination of the basic equation for NPV, Equation 
10.1, should make it clear that because the initial investment (CF0
) is known with 
certainty, a project’s risk is embodied in the present value of its cash inflows:
NPV = a
n
t=1
CFt
(1 + r)
t
- CF0
Two opportunities to adjust the present value of cash inflows for risk exist: 
(1) The cash inflows (CFt
) can be adjusted, or (2) the discount rate (r) can be ad￾justed. Adjusting the cash inflows is highly subjective, so here we describe the 
more popular process of adjusting the discount rate. In addition, we consider the 
portfolio effects of project analysis as well as the practical aspects of the risk￾adjusted discount rate.
dETERMINING RISK-AdJuSTEd dISCOuNT RATES (RAdRS)
A popular approach for risk adjustment involves the use of risk-adjusted discount 
rates (RADRs). This approach uses Equation 10.1 but employs a risk-adjusted 
discount rate, as noted in the expression3
3. The risk-adjusted discount rate approach can be applied in using the internal rate of return as well as the net pres￾ent value. When the IRR is used, the risk-adjusted discount rate becomes the hurdle rate that must be exceeded by 
the IRR for the project to be accepted. When NPV is used, the projected cash inflows are merely discounted at the 
risk-adjusted discount rate.

The risk-adjusted discount rate (RADR) is the rate of return that must be 
earned on a given project to compensate the firm’s owners adequately (that is, to 
maintain or improve the firm’s share price). The higher the risk of a project, the 
higher the RADR and therefore the lower the net present value for a given stream 
of cash inflows.
Talor Namtig is considering investing $1,000 in either of two 
stocks, A or B. She plans to hold the stock for exactly 5 years 
and expects both stocks to pay $80 in annual end-of-year cash dividends. At the 
end of year 5, she estimates that stock A can be sold to net $1,200 and stock B 
can be sold to net $1,500. Talor has carefully researched the two stocks and be￾lieves that although stock A has average risk, stock B is considerably riskier. Her 
research indicates that she should earn an annual return on an average-risk stock 
of 11%. Because stock B is considerably riskier, she will require a 14% return

Although Talor’s calculations indicate that both stock investments are acceptable 
(NPVs . $0) on a risk-adjusted basis, she should invest in Stock B because it has 
a higher NPV.
Because the logic underlying the use of RADRs is closely linked to the capital 
asset pricing model (CAPM) developed in Chapter 8, here we review that model 
and discuss its use in finding RADRs.
Review of CAPM
In Chapter 8, we used the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to link the relevant
risk and return for all assets traded in efficient markets. In the development of the 
CAPM, the total risk of an asset was defined as
Total risk = Nondiversifiable risk + Diversifiable risk (12.3)
For assets traded in an efficient market, the diversifiable risk, which results from 
uncontrollable or random events, can be eliminated through diversification. The 
relevant risk is therefore the nondiversifiable risk, the risk for which owners of 
these assets are rewarded. Nondiversifiable risk for securities is commonly mea￾sured by using beta, which is an index of the degree of movement of an asset’s 
return in response to a change in the market return.
Using beta, bj
, to measure the relevant risk of any asset j, the CAPM is
rj = RF + 3bj * (rm - RF
) 4 (12.4)
where
rj 5 required return on asset j
RF 5 risk-free rate of return
bj 5 beta coefficient for asset j
rm 5 return on the market portfolio of assets
In Chapter 8, we demonstrated that the required return on any asset could be de￾termined by substituting values of RF
, bj
, and rm into the CAPM (Equation 12.4). 
Any security that is expected to earn in excess of its required return would be ac￾ceptable, and those that are expected to earn an inferior return would be rejected.526 PART 5   Long-Term Investment Decisions
using CAPM to Find RAdRs
If we assume for a moment that real corporate assets such as computers, machine 
tools, and special-purpose machinery are traded in efficient markets, the CAPM 
can be redefined as
4. Whenever the IRR is above the cost of capital or required return (IRR . r), the NPV is positive, and whenever the 
IRR is below the cost of capital or required return (IRR , r), the NPV is negative. Because by definition the IRR is 
the discount rate that causes NPV to equal zero and the IRR and NPV always agree on accept–reject decisions, the 
relationship noted in Figure 12.2 logically follows.

The security market line (SML)—the graphical depiction of the CAPM—is shown 
for Equation 12.5 in Figure 12.2. Any project having an IRR above the SML 
would be acceptable because its IRR would exceed the required return, rproject; 
any project with an IRR below rproject would be rejected. In terms of NPV, any 
project falling above the SML would have a positive NPV, and any project falling 
below the SML would have a negative NPV.4
Figure 12.2 shows two projects, L and R. Project L has a beta, bL, and generates 
an internal rate of return, IRRL. The required return for a project with risk bL is 
rL. Because project L generates a return greater than that required (IRRL 7 rL), 
this project is acceptable. Project L will have a positive NPV when its cash in￾flows are discounted at its required return, rL. Project R, on the other hand, gen￾erates an IRR below that required for its risk, bR (IRRR 6 rR). This project will 
have a negative NPV when its cash inflows are discounted at its required return, 
rR. Project R should be rejected.
Example 12.4 ▶ChAPTER 12   Risk and Refinements in Capital Budgeting 527
APPLYING RAdRS
Because the CAPM is based on an assumed efficient market, which does not al￾ways exist for real corporate (nonfinancial) assets such as plant and equipment, 
managers sometimes argue that the CAPM is not directly applicable in calculat￾ing RADRs. Instead, financial managers sometimes assess the total risk of a proj￾ect and use it to determine the risk-adjusted discount rate (RADR), which can be 
used in Equation 12.2 to find the NPV.
To avoid damaging its market value, the firm must use the correct discount 
rate to evaluate a project. The Focus on Ethics box describes a real example of a 
company that failed to recognize (or that ignored) certain risks associated with 
their business operations. As a result, the firm experienced monetary sanctions. If 
a firm fails to incorporate all relevant risks in its decision-making process, it may 
discount a risky project’s cash inflows at too low a rate and accept the project. 
The firm’s market price may drop later as investors recognize that the firm itself 
has become more risky. Conversely, if the firm discounts a project’s cash inflows 
at too high a rate, it will reject acceptable projects. Eventually, the firm’s market 
price may drop because investors who believe that the firm is being overly conser￾vative will sell their stock, putting downward pressure on the firm’s market value.
Unfortunately, there is no formal mechanism for linking total project risk to 
the level of required return. As a result, most firms subjectively determine the 
RADR by adjusting their existing required return. They adjust it up or down 
At the dawn of the 
new millennium, the 
company formerly known as British Pe￾troleum was trying to reinvent itself. BP 
introduced a new corporate logo, a 
green, yellow, and white sunburst that 
“symbolized energy in all its dynamic 
forms.” In its 2009 sustainability review, 
BP defined sustainability as “the capac￾ity to endure as a group: by renewing 
assets; creating and delivering better 
products and services that meet the 
evolving needs of society; attracting 
successive generations of employees; 
contributing to a sustainable environ￾ment; and retaining the trust and sup￾port of our customers, shareholders and 
the communities in which we operate.”a
However, BP’s environmental track 
record didn’t always support the image 
that the company was trying to portray. 
In 2005, a fire at BP’s Texas City Refin￾ery killed 15 workers and injured many 
more. The following year, BP shut down 
its Prudhoe Bay oil field due to corro￾sion in an oil transit line that resulted in 
an oil spill. BP was widely criticized for 
these events, but that did not stop it from 
causing the largest oil spill in U.S. his￾tory when the Deepwater Horizon off￾shore oil platform exploded and sank in 
April 2010.
The Deepwater Horizon accident 
and subsequent oil spill had a signifi￾cant impact on BP’s cost of capital. By 
June 2010, BP’s stock price was 50 
percent below precrisis levels, and the 
company’s bonds traded at levels com￾parable to junk-rated companies. Over 
the course of a single week, when BP’s 
“top kill” attempt to stop the leak 
proved unsuccessful, the yield on the 
company’s main 5-year dollar bond 
jumped by 2 percent. The bond rating 
agencies downgraded BP, although the 
firm continued to possess one of the 
highest investment grade credit ratings. 
However, the rating agencies warned 
that further downgrades could follow if 
the crisis, and the expected costs, con￾tinued to escalate.

depending on whether the proposed project is more or less risky, respectively, 
than the average risk of the firm. This CAPM-type of approach provides a “rough 
estimate” of the project risk and required return because both the project risk 
measure and the linkage between risk and required return are estimates.

much analysis subjectively assigned “risk indexes” of 1.6 to project A and 1.0 to 
project B. The risk index is merely a numerical scale used to classify project risk: 
Higher index values are assigned to higher-risk projects and vice versa. The 
CAPM-type relationship used by the firm to link risk (measured by the risk in￾dex) and the required return (RADR) is shown in the following table. Management 
developed this relationship after analyzing CAPM and the risk–return 
relationships of the projects that they considered and implemented during the 
past few years.
Example 12.5 ▶
  Risk index Required return (RADR)
  0.0 6% (risk-free rate, RF
)
  0.2 7
  0.4 8
  0.6 9
  0.8 10
Project B → 1.0 11
  1.2 12
  1.4 13
Project A → 1.6 14
  1.8 16
  2.0 18
Because project A is riskier than project B, its RADR of 14% is greater than 
project B’s 11%. The net present value of each project, calculated using its 
RADR, is found as shown on the time lines in Figure 12.3. The results clearly 
show that project B is preferable because its risk-adjusted NPV of $9,798 is 
greater than the $6,063 risk-adjusted NPV for project A. As reflected by the 
NPVs in part B of Table 12.1, if the discount rates were not adjusted for risk, 
project A would be preferred to project B.
Calculator use We can again use the preprogrammed NPV function in a financial 
calculator to simplify the NPV calculation. The keystrokes for project A—the an￾nuity—typically are as shown at the left. The keystrokes for project B— the 
mixed stream—are also shown at the left. The calculated NPVs for projects A 
and B of $6,063 and $9,798, respectively, agree with those shown in Figure 12.3.

The usefulness of risk-adjusted discount rates should now be clear. The real 
difficulty lies in estimating project risk and linking it to the required return 
(RADR).
PORTFOLIO EFFECTS
As noted in Chapter 8, because investors are not rewarded for taking diversifiable 
risk, they should hold a diversified portfolio of securities to eliminate that risk. 
Because a business firm can be viewed as a portfolio of assets, is it similarly im￾portant that the firm maintain a diversified portfolio of assets?
It seems logical that the firm could reduce the variability of its cash flows by 
holding a diversified portfolio. By combining two projects with negatively corre￾lated cash inflows, the firm could reduce the combined cash inflow variability 
and therefore the risk.
Are firms rewarded for diversifying risk in this fashion? If they are, the value 
of the firm could be enhanced through diversification into other lines of business. 
Surprisingly, the value of the stock of firms whose shares are traded publicly in 
an efficient marketplace is generally not affected by diversification. In other 
words, diversification is not normally rewarded and therefore is generally not 
necessary.
Why are firms not rewarded for diversification? It is because investors them￾selves can diversify by holding securities in a variety of firms; they do not need 
the firm to do it for them. And investors can diversify more readily. They can 
make transactions more easily and at a lower cost because of the greater avail￾ability of information and trading mechanisms.
Of course, if a firm acquires a new line of business and its cash flows tend to 
respond more to changing economic conditions (that is, greater nondiversifiable 
risk), greater returns would be expected. If, for the additional risk, the firm 
earned a return in excess of that required (IRR 7 r), the value of the firm could 
be enhanced. Also, other benefits, such as increased cash, greater borrowing ca￾pacity, and guaranteed availability of raw materials, could result from and there￾fore justify diversification, despite any immediate impact on cash flow.
Although a strict theoretical view supports the use of a technique that relies on 
the CAPM framework, the presence of market imperfections causes the market for 
real corporate assets to be inefficient at least some of the time. The relative ineffi￾ciency of this market, coupled with difficulties associated with measurement of 
nondiversifiable project risk and its relationship to return, tends to favor the use of 
total risk to evaluate capital budgeting projects. Therefore, the use of total risk as 
an approximation for the relevant risk does have widespread practical appeal.
RAdRS IN PRACTICE
Despite the appeal of total risk, RADRs are often used in practice. Their popular￾ity stems from two facts: (1) They are consistent with the general disposition of 
financial decision makers toward rates of return, and (2) they are easily estimated 
and applied. The first reason is clearly a matter of personal preference, but the 
second is based on the computational convenience and well-developed proce￾dures involved in the use of RADRs.
In practice, firms often establish a number of risk classes, with a RADR 
assigned to each. Like the CAPM-type risk–return relationship described ChAPTER 12   Risk and Refinements in Capital Budgeting 531
earlier, management develops the risk classes and RADRs based on both 
CAPM and the risk–return behaviors of past projects. Each new project is then 
subjectively placed in the appropriate risk class, and the corresponding RADR 
is used to evaluate it. This evalution is sometimes done on a division-by￾division basis, in which case each division has its own set of risk classes and 
associated RADRs, similar to those for Bennett Company in Table 12.3. The 
use of divisional costs of capital and associated risk classes enables a large 
multidivisional firm to incorporate differing levels of divisional risk into the 
capital budgeting process and still recognize differences in the levels of indi￾vidual project risk.
Assume that the management of Bennett Company decided to use risk classes to 
analyze projects and so placed each project in one of four risk classes according 
to its perceived risk. The classes ranged from I for the lowest-risk projects to IV 
for the highest-risk projects. Associated with each class was an RADR appropriate 
to the level of risk of projects in the class as given in Table 12.3. Bennett classified 
as lower-risk those projects that tend to involve routine replacement or renewal 
activities; higher-risk projects involve expansion, often into new or unfamiliar 
activities.
The financial manager of Bennett has assigned project A to class III and proj￾ect B to class II. The cash flows for project A would be evaluated using a 14% 
RADR, and project B’s would be evaluated using a 10% RADR.5
 The NPV of 
project A at 14% was calculated in Figure 12.3 to be $6,063, and the NPV for 
project B at a 10% RADR was shown in Table 12.1 to be $10,924. Clearly, with 
RADRs based on the use of risk classes, project B is preferred over project A. As

aThis RADR is actually the firm’s cost of capital, which is discussed in detail in Chapter 9. It represents the 
firm’s required return on its existing portfolio of projects, which is assumed to be unchanged with 
acceptance of the “average-risk” project.
5. Note that the 10 percent RADR for project B using the risk classes in Table 10.3 differs from the 11 percent 
RADR used in the preceding example for project B. This difference is attributable to the less precise nature of the use 
of risk classes.532 PART 5   Long-Term Investment Decisions
noted earlier, this result is contrary to the preferences shown in Table 12.1, where 
differing risks of projects A and B were not taken into account.

 12.5 Capital Budgeting Refinements
Refinements must often be made in the analysis of capital budgeting projects to 
accommodate special circumstances. These adjustments permit the relaxation of 
certain simplifying assumptions presented earlier. Three areas in which special 
forms of analysis are frequently needed are (1) comparison of mutually exclusive 
projects having unequal lives, (2) recognition of real options, and (3) capital ra￾tioning caused by a binding budget constraint.
COMPARING PROJECTS WITh uNEQuAL LIVES
The financial manager must often select the best of a group of unequal-lived 
projects. If the projects are independent, the length of the project lives is not 
critical. But when unequal-lived projects are mutually exclusive, the impact of 
differing lives must be considered because the projects do not provide service 
over comparable time periods. This step is especially important when continu￾ing service is needed from the project under consideration. The discussions that 
follow assume that the unequal-lived, mutually exclusive projects being com￾pared are ongoing. If they were not, the project with the highest NPV would be 
selected.
The Problem
A simple example will demonstrate the general problem of noncomparability 
caused by the need to select the best of a group of mutually exclusive projects 
with differing usable lives.
The AT Company, a regional cable television company, is evaluating two proj￾ects, X and Y. The relevant cash flows for each project are given in the following 
table. The applicable cost of capital for use in evaluating these equally risky proj￾ects is 10%.

Ignoring the differences in project lives, we can see that both projects are ac￾ceptable (both NPVs are greater than zero) and that project Y is preferred over 
project X. If the projects were independent and only one could be accepted, proj￾ect Y—with the larger NPV—would be preferred. If the projects were mutually 
exclusive, their differing lives would have to be considered. Project Y provides 
3 more years of service than project X.
The analysis in the preceding example is incomplete if the projects are mutu￾ally exclusive (which will be our assumption throughout the remaining discus￾sions). To compare these unequal-lived, mutually exclusive projects correctly, we 
MyFinancelab financial 
calculator534 PART 5   Long-Term Investment Decisions
must consider the differing lives in the analysis; an incorrect decision could result 
from simply using NPV to select the better project. Although a number of ap￾proaches are available for dealing with unequal lives, here we present the most 
efficient technique: the annualized net present value (ANPV) approach.
Annualized Net Present Value (ANPV) Approach
The annualized net present value (ANPV) approach6
 converts the net present 
value of unequal-lived, mutually exclusive projects into an equivalent annual 
amount (in NPV terms) that can be used to select the best project.7
 This net pres￾ent value based approach can be applied to unequal-lived, mutually exclusive 
projects by using the following steps:
Step 1 Calculate the net present value of each project j, NPVj
, over its life, nj
, 
using the appropriate cost of capital, r.
Step 2 Convert the NPVj
 into an annuity having life nj
. That is, find an annuity 
that has the same life and the same NPV as the project.
Step 3 Select the project that has the highest ANPV.
By using the AT Company data presented earlier for projects X and Y, we can 
apply the three-step ANPV approach as follows:
Step 1 The net present values of projects X and Y discounted at 10%—as calcu￾lated in the preceding example for a single purchase of each asset—are
NPVX = $11,277.24
NPVY = $19,013.27
Step 2 In this step, we want to convert the NPVs from Step 1 into annuities. For 
project X, we are trying to find the answer to the question, what 3-year 
annuity (equal to the life of project X) has a present value of $11,277.24 
(the NPV of project X)? Likewise, for project Y we want to know what 
6-year annuity has a present value of $19,013.27. Once we have these 
values, we can determine which project, X or Y, delivers a higher annual 
cash flow on a present value basis.
Calculator use The keystrokes required to find the ANPV on a financial calculator 
are identical to those demonstrated in Chapter 5 for finding the annual payments on 
an installment loan. These keystrokes are shown at the left for project X and for 
project Y. The resulting ANPVs for projects X and Y are $4,534.74 and $4,365.59, 
respectively. (Note that the calculator solutions are shown as negative values be￾cause the PV inputs were entered as positive values.)
Spreadsheet use The annualized net present values of two projects with unequal 
lives also can be compared as shown on the following Excel spreadsheet.
Example 12.8 ▶ 
annualized net present 
value (ANPV) approach
An approach to evaluating 
unequal-lived projects that 
converts the net present value 
of unequal-lived, mutually 
exclusive projects into an 
equivalent annual amount 
(in NPV terms).
6. This approach is also called the “equivalent annual annuity (EAA)” or the “equivalent annual cost.” The term 
annualized net present value (ANPV) is used here due to its descriptive clarity.
7. The theory underlying this as well as other approaches for comparing projects with unequal lives assumes that 
each project can be replaced in the future for the same initial investment and that each will provide the same 
expected future cash inflows. Although changing technology and inflation will affect the initial investment and 
Project Y expected cash inflows, the lack of specific attention to them does not detract from the usefulness of this technique.

Step 3 Reviewing the ANPVs calculated in Step 2, we can see that project X 
would be preferred over project Y. Given that projects X and Y are mu￾tually exclusive, project X would be the recommended project because it 
provides the higher annualized net present value.
RECOGNIZING REAL OPTIONS
The procedures described in Chapters 10 and 11 and thus far in this chapter sug￾gest that to make capital budgeting decisions, we must (1) estimate relevant cash 
flows, (2) apply an appropriate decision technique such as NPV or IRR to those 
cash flows, and (3) recognize and adjust the decision technique for project risk. 
Although this traditional procedure is believed to yield good decisions, a more stra￾tegic approach to these decisions has emerged in recent years. This more modern 
view considers any real options, opportunities that are embedded in capital projects 
(“real,” rather than financial, asset investments) that enable managers to alter their 
cash flows and risk in a way that affects project acceptability (NPV). Because these 
opportunities are more likely to exist in, and be more important to, large “strate￾gic” capital budgeting projects, they are sometimes called strategic options.
Table 12.4 briefly describes some of the more common types of real options— 
abandonment, flexibility, growth, and timing. It should be clear from their de￾scriptions that each of these types of options could be embedded in a capital 
budgeting decision and that explicit recognition of them would probably alter the 
cash flow and risk of a project and change its NPV.
By explicitly recognizing these options when making capital budgeting deci￾sions, managers can make improved, more strategic decisions that consider in 
advance the economic impact of certain contingent actions on project cash flow 
and risk. The explicit recognition of real options embedded in capital budgeting

projects will cause the project’s strategic NPV to differ from its traditional NPV,
as indicated by Equation 12.6.
TABLE 12.4 Major Types of Real Options
Option type Description
Abandonment option The option to abandon or terminate a project prior to the end of its planned life. This option allows 
management to avoid or minimize losses on projects that turn bad. Explicitly recognizing the 
abandonment option when evaluating a project often increases its NPV.
Flexibility option The option to incorporate flexibility into the firm’s operations, particularly production. It generally 
includes the opportunity to design the production process to accept multiple inputs, to use flexible 
production technology to create a variety of outputs by reconfiguring the same plant and equipment, 
and to purchase and retain excess capacity in capital-intensive industries subject to wide swings in 
output demand and long lead time in building new capacity from scratch. Recognition of this option 
embedded in a capital expenditure should increase the NPV of the project.
Growth option The option to develop follow-on projects, expand markets, expand or retool plants, and so on that 
would not be possible without implementation of the project that is being evaluated. If a project 
being considered has the measurable potential to open new doors if successful, recognition of the cash 
flows from such opportunities should be included in the initial decision process. Growth 
opportunities embedded in a project often increase the NPV of the project in which they are 
embedded.
Timing option The option to determine when various actions with respect to a given project are taken. This option 
recognizes the firm’s opportunity to delay acceptance of a project for one or more periods, to 
accelerate or slow the process of implementing a project in response to new information, or to shut 
down a project temporarily in response to changing product market conditions or competition. As in 
the case of the other types of options, the explicit recognition of timing opportunities can improve the 
NPV of a project that fails to recognize this option in an investment decision.
NPVstrategic = NPVtraditional + Value of real options (12.6)
Application of this relationship is illustrated in the following example.
Assume that a strategic analysis of Bennett Company’s projects A and B (see cash 
flows and NPVs in Table 12.1) finds no real options embedded in project A and 
two real options embedded in project B. The two real options in project B are as 
follows: (1) The project would have, during the first 2 years, some downtime that 
would result in unused production capacity that could be used to perform con￾tract manufacturing for another firm; and (2) the project’s computerized control 
system could, with some modification, control two other machines, thereby re￾ducing labor cost, without affecting operation of the new project.
Bennett’s management estimated the NPV of the contract manufacturing 
over the 2 years following implementation of project B to be $1,500 and the NPV 
of the computer control sharing to be $2,000. Management believed that there 
was a 60% chance that the contract manufacturing option would be exercised 
and only a 30% chance that the computer control sharing option would be exer￾cised. The combined value of these two real options would be the sum of their 
expected values:
Value of real options for project B = (0.60 * $1,500) + (0.30 * $2,000)
= $900 + $600 = $1,500
Example 12.9 ▶ ChAPTER 12   Risk and Refinements in Capital Budgeting 537
Substituting the $1,500 real options value along with the traditional NPV of 
$10,924 for project B (from Table 12.1) into Equation 12.7, we get the strategic 
NPV for project B:
NPVstrategic = $10,924 + $1,500 = $12,424
Bennett Company’s project B therefore has a strategic NPV of $12,424, 
which is above its traditional NPV and now exceeds project A’s NPV of $11,071. 
Clearly, recognition of project B’s real options improved its NPV (from $10,924 
to $12,424) and causes it to be preferred over project A (NPV of $12,424 for 
B 7 NPV of $11,071 for A), which has no real options embedded in it.
It is important to realize that the recognition of attractive real options when 
determining NPV could cause an otherwise unacceptable project (NPVtraditional 6 $0) 
to become acceptable (NPVstrategic 7 $0). The failure to recognize the value of 
real options could therefore cause management to reject projects that are accept￾able. Although doing so requires more strategic thinking and analysis, it is impor￾tant for the financial manager to identify and incorporate real options in the NPV 
process. The procedures for doing so efficiently are emerging, and the use of the 
strategic NPV that incorporates real options is expected to become more com￾monplace in the future.
CAPITAL RATIONING
Firms commonly operate under capital rationing in that they have more accept￾able independent projects than they can fund. In theory, capital rationing should 
not exist. Firms should accept all projects that have positive NPVs (or IRRs 7 the 
cost of capital). However, in practice, most firms operate under capital rationing. 
Generally, firms attempt to isolate and select the best acceptable projects subject to 
a capital expenditure budget set by management. Research has found that man￾agement internally imposes capital expenditure constraints to avoid what it deems 
to be “excessive” levels of new financing, particularly debt. Although failing to 
fund all acceptable independent projects is theoretically inconsistent with the goal 
of maximizing owner wealth, here we will discuss capital rationing procedures 
because they are widely used in practice.
The objective of capital rationing is to select the group of projects that pro￾vides the highest overall net present value and does not require more dollars 
than are budgeted. As a prerequisite to capital rationing, the best of any mutu￾ally exclusive projects must be chosen and placed in the group of independent 
projects. Two basic approaches to project selection under capital rationing are 
discussed here.
Internal Rate of Return Approach
The internal rate of return approach involves graphing project IRRs in descend￾ing order against the total dollar investment. This graph is called the investment 
opportunities schedule (IOS). By drawing the cost-of-capital line and then impos￾ing a budget constraint, the financial manager can determine the group of accept￾able projects. The problem with this technique is that it does not guarantee the 
maximum dollar return to the firm. It merely provides an intuitively appealing 
solution to capital-rationing problems.

Tate Company, a fast-growing plastics company, is confronted with six projects 
competing for its fixed budget of $250,000. The initial investment and IRR for 
each project are as follows:

E 260,000 15
F 2110,000 11
The firm has a cost of capital of 10%. Figure 12.4 presents the IOS that results 
from ranking the six projects in descending order on the basis of their IRRs. 
According to the schedule, only projects B, C, and E should be accepted. Together 
they will absorb $230,000 of the $250,000 budget. Projects A and F are accept￾able but cannot be chosen because of the budget constraint. Project D is not wor￾thy of consideration; its IRR is less than the firm’s 10% cost of capital.
The drawback of this approach is that there is no guarantee that the accep￾tance of projects B, C, and E will maximize total dollar returns and therefore 
owners’ wealth.
Net Present Value Approach
The net present value approach is based on the use of present values to determine 
the group of projects that will maximize owners’ wealth. It is implemented by 
ranking projects on the basis of IRRs and then evaluating the present value of the 
net present value approach

benefits from each potential project to determine the combination of projects 
with the highest overall present value. This method is the same as maximizing net 
present value because the entire budget is viewed as the total initial investment. 
Any portion of the firm’s budget that is not used does not increase the firm’s 
value. At best, the unused money can be invested in marketable securities or re￾turned to the owners in the form of cash dividends. In either case, the wealth of 
the owners is not likely to be enhanced.
The projects described in the preceding example are ranked in Table 12.5 on the 
basis of IRRs. The present value of the cash inflows associated with the projects 
is also included in the table. Projects B, C, and E, which together require 
$230,000, yield a present value of $336,000. However, if projects B, C, and A 
were implemented, the total budget of $250,000 would be used, and the present 
value of the cash inflows would be $357,000, which is greater than the return 
expected from selecting the projects on the basis of the highest IRRs. Implement￾ing B, C, and A is preferable because they maximize the present value for the 
given budget. The firm’s objective is to use its budget to generate the highest 
present value of inflows. Assuming that any unused portion of the budget does 
not gain or lose money, the total NPV for projects B, C, and E would be $106,000 
($336,000 - $230,000), whereas the total NPV for projects B, C, and A would 
be $107,000 ($357,000 - $250,000). Selection of projects B, C, and A will 
therefore maximize NPV.

Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
Not all capital budgeting projects have the same risk as the firm’s existing port￾folio of projects. The financial manager must adjust projects for differences in 
risk when evaluating their acceptability. Without such an adjustment, manage￾ment could mistakenly accept projects that destroy shareholder value or could 
reject projects that create shareholder value. To ensure that neither of these out￾comes occurs, the financial manager must make sure that only those projects 
that create shareholder value are recommended.
Risk-adjusted discount rates (RADRs) provide a mechanism for adjusting 
the discount rate so that it is consistent with the risk–return preferences of mar￾ket participants. Procedures for comparing projects with unequal lives, for ex￾plicitly recognizing real options embedded in capital projects, and for selecting 
projects under capital rationing enable the financial manager to refine the capi￾tal budgeting process further. These procedures, along with risk-adjustment 
techniques, should enable the financial manager to make capital budgeting deci￾sions that are consistent with the firm’s goal of maximizing stock price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Understand the importance of recognizing risk in the analysis of capital 
budgeting projects. The cash flows associated with capital budgeting projects 
typically have different levels of risk, and the acceptance of a project generally 
affects the firm’s overall risk. Thus, it is important to incorporate risk consider￾ations in capital budgeting. Various behavioral approaches can be used to get a 
“feel” for the level of project risk. Other approaches explicitly recognize project 
risk in the analysis of capital budgeting projects.
Discuss breakeven analysis, scenario analysis, and simulation as behavioral 
approaches for dealing with risk. Risk in capital budgeting is the degree of vari￾ability of cash flows, which for conventional capital budgeting projects stems al￾most entirely from net cash flows. Finding the breakeven cash inflow and esti￾mating the probability that it will be realized make up one behavioral approach 
for assessing capital budgeting risk. Scenario analysis is another behavioral ap￾proach for capturing the variability of cash inflows and NPVs. Simulation is a 
statistically based approach that results in a probability distribution of project 
returns.
Review the unique risks that multinational companies face. Although the ba￾sic capital budgeting techniques are the same for multinational and purely domestic 
companies, firms that operate in several countries must also deal with exchange rate 
and political risks, tax law differences, transfer pricing, and strategic issues.

Describe the determination and use of risk-adjusted discount rates 
(RADRs), portfolio effects, and the practical aspects of RADRs. The risk of a 
project whose initial investment is known with certainty is embodied in the pres￾ent value of its cash inflows, using NPV. There are two opportunities to adjust 
the present value of cash inflows for risk: (1) adjust the cash inflows or (2) ad￾just the discount rate. Because adjusting the cash inflows is highly subjective, ad￾justing discount rates is more popular. RADRs use a market-based adjustment of 
the discount rate to calculate NPV. The RADR is closely linked to CAPM, but 
because real corporate assets are generally not traded in an efficient market, the 
CAPM cannot be applied directly to capital budgeting. Instead, firms develop 
some CAPM-type relationship to link a project’s risk to its required return, 
which is used as the discount rate. Often, for convenience, firms will rely on to￾tal risk as an approximation for relevant risk when estimating required project 
returns. RADRs are commonly used in practice because decision makers find 
rates of return easy to estimate and apply.
Select the best of a group of unequal-lived, mutually exclusive projects using 
annualized net present values (ANPVs). The ANPV approach is the most efficient 
method of comparing ongoing, mutually exclusive projects that have unequal us￾able lives. It converts the NPV of each unequal-lived project into an equivalent an￾nual amount, its ANPV. The ANPV can be calculated using equations, a financial 
calculator, or a spreadsheet. The project with the highest ANPV is best.
Explain the role of real options and the objective and procedures for select￾ing projects under capital rationing. Real options are opportunities that are em￾bedded in capital projects and that allow managers to alter their cash flow and risk 
in a way that affects project acceptability (NPV). By explicitly recognizing real op￾tions, the financial manager can find a project’s strategic NPV. Some of the more 
common types of real options are abandonment, flexibility, growth, and timing op￾tions. The strategic NPV improves the quality of the capital budgeting decision.
Capital rationing exists when firms have more acceptable independent proj￾ects than they can fund. Capital rationing commonly occurs in practice. Its ob￾jective is to select from all acceptable projects the group that provides the high￾est overall net present value and does not require more dollars than are 
budgeted. The two basic approaches for choosing projects under capital ration￾ing are the internal rate of return approach and the net present value approach. 
The NPV approach better achieves the objective of using the budget to generate 
the highest present value of inflows.

a high-definition (HD) television because the technology has improved and prices 
have fallen over the past 3 years. From their research, they narrow their choices to 
two sets, the Samsung 64-inch plasma with 1080p capability and the Sony 64-inch 
plasma with 1080p features. The price of the Samsung is $2,350, and the Sony will 
cost $2,700. They expect to keep the Samsung for 3 years; if they buy the more ex￾pensive Sony unit, they will keep the Sony for 4 years. They expect to be able to sell 
the Samsung for $400 by the end of 3 years; they expect they could sell the Sony for 
$350 at the end of year 4. Richard and Linda estimate the end-of-year entertainment 
benefits (that is, not going to movies or events and watching at home) from the Sam￾sung to be $900 and for the Sony to be $1,000. Both sets can be viewed as quality 
units and are equally risky purchases. They estimate their opportunity cost to be 9%.
The Butlers wish to choose the better alternative from a purely financial per￾spective. To perform this analysis they wish to do the following:
a. Determine the NPV of the Samsung HD plasma TV.

 P12–17 Real options and the strategic NPV Jenny Rene, the CFO of Asor Products, Inc., has 
just completed an evaluation of a proposed capital expenditure for equipment that 
would expand the firm’s manufacturing capacity. Using the traditional NPV meth￾odology, she found the project unacceptable because
NPVtraditional = -$1,700 6 $0
Before recommending rejection of the proposed project, she has decided to assess 
whether there might be real options embedded in the firm’s cash flows. Her evalua￾tion uncovered three options:
Option 1: Abandonment. The project could be abandoned at the end of 
3 years, resulting in an addition to NPV of $1,200.
Option 2: Growth. If the projected outcomes occurred, an opportunity to ex￾pand the firm’s product offerings further would become available at the end of 
4 years. Exercise of this option is estimated to add $3,000 to the project’s NPV.
Option 3: Timing. Certain phases of the proposed project could be delayed if 
market and competitive conditions caused the firm’s forecast revenues to de￾velop more slowly than planned. Such a delay in implementation at that point 
has an NPV of $10,000.
Jenny estimated that there was a 25% chance that the abandonment option 
would need to be exercised, a 30% chance that the growth option would be exer￾cised, and only a 10% chance that the implementation of certain phases of the 
project would affect timing.

Asor Products’ proposed equipment expenditure.
b. Judging on the basis of your findings in part a, what action should Jenny recom￾mend to management with regard to the proposed equipment expenditure?

 P12–20 ETHICS PROBLEM The Environmental Protection Agency sometimes imposes penal￾ties on firms that pollute the environment (see the Focus on Ethics box on page 527). 
But did you know that there is a legal market for pollution? A mechanism that has 
been developed to limit excessive air pollution is to use carbon credits. Carbon credits 
are a tradable permit scheme that allows businesses that cannot meet their greenhouse￾gas-emissions limits to purchase carbon credits from businesses that are below their 
quota. By allowing credits to be bought and sold, a business for which reducing its 
emissions would be expensive or prohibitive can pay another business to make the re￾duction for it. Do you agree with this arrangement? How would you feel as an inves￾tor in a company that uses carbon credits to legally exceed its pollution limits?554 PART 5   Long-Term Investment Decisions

Lasting Impressions Company
L
asting Impressions (LI) Company is a medium-sized commercial printer of pro￾motional advertising brochures, booklets, and other direct-mail pieces. The 
firm’s major clients are ad agencies based in New York and Chicago. The typical job 
is characterized by high quality and production runs of more than 50,000 units. LI 
has not been able to compete effectively with larger printers because of its existing 
older, inefficient presses. The firm is currently having problems meeting run length 
requirements as well as meeting quality standards in a cost-effective manner.
The general manager has proposed the purchase of one of two large, six-color 
presses designed for long, high-quality runs. The purchase of a new press would en￾able LI to reduce its cost of labor and therefore the price to the client, putting the 
firm in a more competitive position. The key financial characteristics of the old press 
and of the two proposed presses are summarized in what follows.
Old press Originally purchased 3 years ago at an installed cost of $400,000, it 
is being depreciated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. The old 
press has a remaining economic life of 5 years. It can be sold today to net 
$420,000 before taxes; if it is retained, it can be sold to net $150,000 before 
taxes at the end of 5 years.
Press A This highly automated press can be purchased for $830,000 and will 
require $40,000 in installation costs. It will be depreciated under MACRS using 
a 5-year recovery period. At the end of the 5 years, the machine could be sold to 
net $400,000 before taxes. If this machine is acquired, it is anticipated that the 
current account changes shown in the following table would result.
Integrative Case 5
Cash 1 $ 25,400
Accounts receivable 1 120,000
Inventories 2 20,000
Accounts payable 1 35,000
Press B This press is not as sophisticated as press A. It costs $640,000 and 
requires $20,000 in installation costs. It will be depreciated under MACRS us￾ing a 5-year recovery period. At the end of 5 years, it can be sold to net 
$330,000 before taxes. Acquisition of this press will have no effect on the firm’s 
net working capital investment.
The firm estimates that its earnings before depreciation, interest, and taxes with 
the old press and with press A or press B for each of the 5 years would be as shown 
in the table at the top of the next page. The firm is subject to a 40% tax rate. The 
firm’s cost of capital, r, applicable to the proposed replacement is 14%.556
TO dO
a. For each of the two proposed replacement presses, determine:
(1) Initial investment.
(2) Operating cash inflows. (Note: Be sure to consider the depreciation in year 6.)
(3) Terminal cash flow. (Note: This is at the end of year 5.)
b. Using the data developed in part a, find and depict on a time line the relevant 
cash flow stream associated with each of the two proposed replacement presses, 
assuming that each is terminated at the end of 5 years.
c. Using the data developed in part b, apply each of the following decision tech￾niques:
(1) Payback period. (Note: For year 5, use only the operating cash inflows—that 
is, exclude terminal cash flow—when making this calculation.)
(2) Net present value (NPV).
(3) Internal rate of return (IRR).
d. Draw net present value profiles for the two replacement presses on the same set 
of axes, and discuss conflicting rankings of the two presses, if any, resulting from 
use of NPV and IRR decision techniques.
e. Recommend which, if either, of the presses the firm should acquire if the firm has 
(1) unlimited funds or (2) capital rationing.
f. The operating cash inflows associated with press A are characterized as very 
risky in contrast to the low-risk operating cash inflows of press B. What impact 
does that have on your recommendation?

hapters 10 through 12 focused on how firms should invest money, but those 
chapters were silent on where firms obtained the money to invest in the first 
place. In Chapters 13 and 14, we examine firms’ long-term financial decisions. 
Broadly speaking, these chapters focus on the trade-offs associated with different 
sources of investment capital.
Chapter 13 looks at the firm’s most basic long-term financial decision: whether to 
raise money by selling stock (equity) or by borrowing money (debt). A firm’s mix 
of debt and equity financing is called its capital structure. Some firms choose a 
capital structure that contains no debt at all, whereas other firms rely more heavily 
on debt financing than on equity. The capital structure choice is extremely impor￾tant because how much debt a firm uses influences the returns that a firm can pro￾vide to its investors as well as the risks associated with those returns. More debt 
generally means higher returns but also higher risks. Chapter 13 illustrates how 
firms balance that trade-off.
Chapter 14 focuses on payout policy. Payout policy refers to the decisions that 
firms make about whether and how to distribute cash to shareholders via divi￾dends and share repurchases. We can make a similar observation about payout 
policy that we made about capital structure. Some firms choose to distribute no 
cash at all, preferring instead to reinvest cash in the business or to build up large 
cash reserves that might be used for strategic investments like acquisitions. Other 
firms pay billions in dividends and stock buybacks each year. Chapter 14 
explains the factors that firms consider when forming their payout policies.

capital structure is because you will provide much of the information needed in 
management’s determination of the best capital structure for the firm.
mAnAgement  You need to understand leverage so that you can control risk 
and magnify returns for the firm’s owners and to understand capital structure 
theory so that you can make decisions about the firm’s optimal capital structure.
mArketing  You need to understand breakeven analysis, which you will use in

operAtionS  You need to understand the impact of fixed and variable 
operating costs on the firm’s breakeven point and its operating leverage because 
these costs will have a major effect on the firm’s risk and return.
In your personal life Like corporations, you routinely incur debt, 
using both credit cards for short-term needs 
and negotiated long-term loans. When you borrow over the long term, you 
experience the benefits and consequences of leverage. Also, the level of your 
outstanding debt relative to net worth is conceptually the same as a firm’s capital 
structure. it reflects your financial risk and affects the availability and cost of 
borrowing.

Lowe’s Builds Leverage
I
n April 2012, the home improvement chain 
Lowe’s issued $2 billion worth of bonds with 
maturities ranging from 5 to 30 years. The com￾pany’s chief financial officer, Robert Hull, ex￾plained in a conference call with investors that 
Lowe’s planned to use the proceeds from the bond 
sale, along with cash flow generated by the busi￾ness, to buy back up to $4.5 billion of its own 
stock. That plan represented a significant shift in the firm’s capital structure (its mix of debt and eq￾uity financing), a move that would put more cash in the hands of shareholders and apply more 
pressure on Lowe’s management to generate positive cash flow from the business to repay the 
debt. With more of its financing coming from debt, Lowe’s was adding financial leverage to its 
business, meaning that if the firm succeeded in selling its products, the returns to shareholders 
would be magnified. However, if Lowe’s instead experienced a decline in its business, paying 
back the debt might be difficult, and returns to shareholders would suffer as a result.
At first, Lowe’s financial strategy appeared to have backfired, as the company reported dis￾appointing revenues and profits from the spring and summer months of 2012, and its stock price fell 
from around $31 in April to $24.50 in early August. Helped by a recovering economy and later 
by Hurricane Sandy, however, Lowe’s business began to turn around. In the third quarter of 2012, 
Lowe’s profits surged 76 percent, and investors sent its stock price up 7 percent in a single day. In 
the 12 months starting August 1, 2012, Lowe’s stock price rose more than 70 percent, whereas the 
Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Composite Index managed to gain a little more than 20 percent.
Lowe’s experience after shifting its capital structure toward more debt illustrates the general 
principle that as a company relies more heavily on debt, its profits become more sensitive to underly￾ing business conditions. Earnings rise rapidly in good times and fall more steeply in bad times, and 
stock prices react accordingly. In this chapter, we’ll uncover the factors that influence a company’s 
decisions about financing its operations with debt or equity.
Lowe’s560 PART 6   Long-Term Financial Decisions
 13.1 Leverage
Leverage refers to the effects that fixed costs have on the returns that sharehold￾ers earn. By “fixed costs,” we mean costs that do not rise and fall with changes in 
a firm’s sales. Firms have to pay these fixed costs whether business conditions are 
good or bad. These fixed costs may be operating costs, such as the costs incurred 
by purchasing and operating plant and equipment, or they may be financial costs, 
such as the fixed costs of making debt payments. We say that a firm with higher 
fixed costs has greater leverage. Generally, leverage magnifies both returns and 
risks. A firm with more leverage may earn higher returns on average than a firm 
with less leverage, but the returns on the more leveraged firm will also be more 
volatile.
Many business risks are out of the control of managers, but not the risks 
associated with leverage. Managers can either increase or decrease leverage by 
adopting strategies that rely more heavily on fixed or variable costs. For exam￾ple, a choice that many firms confront is whether to make their own products 
or to outsource manufacturing to another firm. A company that does its own 
manufacturing may invest billions in factories around the world. These facto￾ries generate costs whether they are running or not so a firm that does its own 
manufacturing will tend to have higher leverage. In contrast, a company that 
outsources production can quickly reduce its costs when demand is low simply 
by not placing orders. Therefore, such a firm will generally have lower leverage 
compared to a firm that manufactures its own goods.
Managers also influence leverage by choosing a specific capital structure, 
which is the mix of long-term debt and equity maintained by a firm. The more 
debt a firm issues, the higher are its debt repayment costs, and those costs must 
be paid regardless of how the firm’s products are selling. Because leverage can 
have such a large impact on a firm, the financial manager must understand how 
to measure and evaluate leverage, particularly when making capital structure 
decisions.
Table 13.1 uses an income statement to highlight where different sources of 
leverage come from.

	 •	 Operating leverage is concerned with the relationship between the firm’s sales 
revenue and its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) or operating profits. 
When costs of operations (such as cost of goods sold and operating expenses) are 
largely fixed, small changes in revenue will lead to much larger changes in EBIT.
	 •	 Financial leverage is concerned with the relationship between the firm’s EBIT 
and its common stock earnings per share (EPS). On the income statement, you 
can see that the deductions taken from EBIT to get to EPS include interest, 
taxes, and preferred dividends. Taxes are clearly variable, rising and falling 
with the firm’s profits, but interest expense and preferred dividends are usu￾ally fixed. When these fixed items are large (that is, when the firm has a lot of 
financial leverage), small changes in EBIT produce larger changes in EPS.
	 •	 Total leverage is the combined effect of operating and financial leverage. It is 
concerned with the relationship between the firm’s sales revenue and EPS.
We will examine the three types of leverage concepts in detail. First, though, 
we will look at breakeven analysis, which lays the foundation for leverage con￾cepts by demonstrating the effects of fixed costs on the firm’s operations.
BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS
Firms use breakeven analysis, also called cost-volume-profit analysis, (1) to 
determine the level of operations necessary to cover all costs and (2) to evaluate 
the profitability associated with various levels of sales. The firm’s operating 
breakeven point is the level of sales necessary to cover all operating costs. At that 
point, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) equals $0.1
The first step in finding the operating breakeven point is to divide the cost of 
goods sold and operating expenses into fixed and variable operating costs. Fixed 
costs are costs that the firm must pay in a given period regardless of the sales 
volume achieved during that period. These costs are typically contractual; rent, 
for example, is a fixed cost. Because fixed costs do not vary with sales, we typi￾cally measure them relative to time. For example, we would typically measure 
rent as the amount due per month. Variable costs vary directly with sales volume. 
Shipping costs, for example, are a variable cost.2
 We typically measure variable 
costs in dollars per unit sold.
Algebraic Approach
Using the following variables, we can recast the operating portion of the firm’s 
income statement given in Table 13.1 into the algebraic representation shown in 
Table 13.2, where
P = sale price per unit
Q = sales quantity in units
FC = fixed operating cost per period
VC = variable operating cost per unit
breakeven analysis
Used to indicate the level of 
operations necessary to cover 
all costs and to evaluate the 
profitability associated with 
various levels of sales; also 
called cost-volume-profit 
analysis.
operating breakeven point
The level of sales necessary to 
cover all operating costs; the 
point at which EBIT 5 $0.
1. Quite often, the breakeven point is calculated so that it represents the point at which all costs—both operating 
and financial—are covered. For now, we focus on the operating breakeven point as a way to introduce the concept 
of operating leverage. We will discuss financial leverage later.
2. Some costs, commonly called semifixed or semivariable, are partly fixed and partly variable. An example is sales 
commissions that are fixed for a certain volume of sales and then increase to higher levels for higher volumes. For 
convenience and clarity, we assume that all costs can be classified as either fixed or variable.562 PART 6   Long-Term Financial Decisions
Rewriting the algebraic calculations in Table 13.2 as a formula for earnings be￾fore interest and taxes yields Equation 13.1:
EBIT = (P * Q) - FC - (VC * Q) (13.1)
Q =
FC
P - VC (13.3)

Simplifying Equation 13.1 yields

Assume that Cheryl’s Posters, a small poster retailer, has fixed operating costs of 
$2,500. Its sale price is $10 per poster, and its variable operating cost is $5 per 
poster. Applying Equation 13.3 to these data yields
Q =
$2,500
$10 - $5 =
$2,500
$5 = 500 units
At sales of 500 units, the firm’s EBIT should just equal $0. The firm will have 
positive EBIT for sales greater than 500 units and negative EBIT, or a loss, for sales 
less than 500 units. We can confirm this conclusion by substituting values above 
and below 500 units, along with the other values given, into Equation 13.1.
Example 13.1 ▶
3. Because the firm is assumed to be a single-product firm, its operating breakeven point is found in terms of unit 
sales, Q. For multiproduct firms, the operating breakeven point is generally found in terms of dollar sales, S. We can 
find S by substituting the contribution margin, which is 100 percent minus total variable operating costs as a per￾centage of total sales, denoted VC%, into the denominator of Equation 13.3. The result is Equation 13.3a
S =
FC
1 - VC,
(13.3a)
This multiproduct-firm breakeven point assumes that the firm’s product mix remains the same at all levels of sales. ¯˘˙
EBIT = Q * (P - VC) - FC (13.2)
As noted above, the operating breakeven point is the level of sales at which all 
fixed and variable operating costs are covered, that is, the level at which EBIT 
equals $0. Setting EBIT equal to $0 and solving Equation 13.2 for Q yields

Graphical Approach
Figure 13.1 presents in graphical form the breakeven analysis of the data in the 
preceding example. The firm’s operating breakeven point is the point at which its 
total operating cost—the sum of its fixed and variable operating costs—equals 
sales revenue. At this point, EBIT equals $0. The figure shows that for sales be￾low 500 units, total operating cost exceeds sales revenue, and EBIT is less than $0 
(a loss). For sales above the breakeven point of 500 units, sales revenue exceeds 
total operating cost, and EBIT is greater than $0.
Changing Costs and the Operating Breakeven Point
A firm’s operating breakeven point is sensitive to a number of variables: the fixed 
operating cost (FC), the sale price per unit (P), and the variable operating cost per 
unit (VC). Refer to Equation 13.3 to see how increases or decreases in these vari￾ables affect the breakeven point. The sensitivity of the breakeven sales volume 
(Q) to an increase in each of these variables is summarized in Table 13.3. As

might be expected, an increase in cost (FC or VC) tends to increase the operating 
breakeven point, whereas an increase in the sale price per unit (P) decreases the 
operating breakeven point.
Assume that Cheryl’s Posters wishes to evaluate the impact of several options: 
(1) increasing fixed operating costs to $3,000, (2) increasing the sale price per 
unit to $12.50, (3) increasing the variable operating cost per unit to $7.50, and 
(4) simultaneously implementing all three of these changes. Substituting the ap￾propriate data into Equation 13.3 yields
 (1) Operating breakeven point =
$3,000
$10 - $5 = 600 units
 (2) Operating breakeven point =
$2,500
$12.50 - $5 = 3331

 (3) Operating breakeven point =

$10 - $7.50 = 1,000 units
 (4) Operating breakeven point =

$12.50 - $7.50 = 600 units
Comparing the resulting operating breakeven points to the initial value of 500 
units, we can see that the cost increases (actions 1 and 3) raise the breakeven 
point, whereas the revenue increase (action 2) lowers the breakeven point. The 
combined effect of increasing all three variables (action 4) also results in an in￾creased operating breakeven point.
Rick Polo is considering having a new fuel-saving device in￾stalled in his car. The installed cost of the device is $240 paid 
up front plus a monthly fee of $15. He can terminate use of the device any time 
without penalty. Rick estimates that the device will reduce his average monthly 
gas consumption by 20%, which, assuming no change in his monthly mileage, 
translates into a savings of about $28 per month. He is planning to keep the car 
for 2 more years and wishes to determine whether he should have the device in￾stalled in his car.
To assess the financial feasibility of purchasing the device, Rick calculates the 
number of months it will take for him to break even. Letting the installed cost of 
$240 represent the fixed cost (FC), the monthly savings of $28 represent the ben￾efit (P), and the monthly fee of $15 represent the variable cost (VC), and substi￾tuting these values into the breakeven point equation, Equation 13.3, we get
Breakeven point (in months) = $240 , ($28 - $15) = $240 , $13
5 18.5 months
Because the fuel-saving device pays itself back in 18.5 months, which is less than 
the 24 months that Rick is planning to continue owning the car, he should have 
the fuel-saving device installed in his car.

OPERATING LEVERAGE
Operating leverage results from the existence of fixed costs that the firm must pay 
to operate. Using the structure presented in Table 13.2, we can define operating 
leverage as the use of fixed operating costs to magnify the effects of changes in 
sales on the firm’s earnings before interest and taxes.
Using the data for Cheryl’s Posters (sale price, P = $10 per unit; variable operat￾ing cost, VC = $5 per unit; fixed operating cost, FC = $2,500), Figure 13.2 
presents the operating breakeven graph originally shown in Figure 13.1. The ad￾ditional notations on the graph indicate that as the firm’s sales increase from 
1,000 to 1,500 units (Q1
 to Q2
), its EBIT increases from $2,500 to $5,000 (EBIT1
to EBIT2
). In other words, a 50% increase in sales (1,000 to 1,500 units) results 
in a 100% increase in EBIT ($2,500 to $5,000). Table 13.4 includes the data for 
Figure 13.2 as well as relevant data for a 500-unit sales level. We can illustrate 
two cases using the 1,000-unit sales level as a reference point:
Case 1 A 50% increase in sales (from 1,000 to 1,500 units) results in a 100% 
increase in earnings before interest and taxes (from $2,500 to $5,000).
Case 2 A 50% decrease in sales (from 1,000 to 500 units) results in a 100% 
decrease in earnings before interest and taxes (from $2,500 to $0).
From the preceding example, we see that operating leverage works in both 
directions. When a firm has fixed operating costs, operating leverage is present.

Measuring the degree of Operating Leverage (dOL)
The degree of operating leverage (DOL) is a numerical measure of the firm’s op￾erating leverage. It can be derived using the equation4

Sales revenue = $10/unit * sales in units.
bVariable operating costs = $5/unit * sales in units.
4. The degree of operating leverage also depends on the base level of sales used as a point of reference. The closer the 
base sales level used is to the operating breakeven point, the greater the operating leverage. Comparison of the de￾gree of operating leverage of two firms is valid only when the same base level of sales is used for both firms.
degree of operating 
leverage (DOL)
The numerical measure of the 
firm’s operating leverage.
 DOL =
Percentage change in EBIT
Percentage change in sales (13.4)
Whenever the percentage change in EBIT resulting from a given percentage 
change in sales is greater than the percentage change in sales, operating lever￾age exists. In other words, as long as DOL is greater than 1, there is operating 
leverage.
Applying Equation 13.4 to cases 1 and 2 in Table 13.4 yields the following results:
Case 1 
+100,
+50,
= 2.0
Case 2 -100,
-50,
= 2.0
These calculations show that Cheryl’s Posters’ EBIT changes twice as much (on a 
percentage basis) as its sales. For a given base level of sales, the higher the value 
resulting from applying Equation 13.4, the greater the degree of operating leverage.
Example 13.5 ▶
MyFinancelab Solution
VideoChAPTER 13   Leverage and Capital Structure 567
Substituting Q = 1,000, P = $10, VC = $5, and FC = $2,500 into Equation 
13.5 gives us
DOL at 1,000 units =
1,000 * ($10 - $5)
1,000 * ($10 - $5) - $2,500 =
$5,000
$2,500 = 2.0
As before, the DOL value of 2.0 means that at Cheryl’s Posters a change in sales 
volume results in an EBIT change that is twice as large in percentage terms.6
See the Focus on Practice box for a discussion of operating leverage at soft￾ware maker Adobe.
Example 13.6 ▶
5. Technically, the formula for DOL given in Equation 13.5 should include absolute value signs because it is possible 
to get a negative DOL when the EBIT for the base sales level is negative. Because we assume that the EBIT for the 
base level of sales is positive, we do not use the absolute value signs.
6. When total revenue in dollars from sales—instead of unit sales—is available, the following equation, in which TR 5 
total revenue in dollars at a base level of sales and TVC = total variable operating costs in dollars, can be used:
DOL at base dollar sales TR =
TR - TVC
TR - TVC - FC
This formula is especially useful for finding the DOL for multiproduct firms. It should be clear that because in the 
case of a single-product firm, TR = Q * P and TVC = Q * VC, substitution of these values into Equation 13.5 
results in the equation given here.
A more direct formula for calculating the degree of operating leverage at a 
base sales level, Q, is5
 DOL at base sales level Q =
Q * (P - VC)
Q * (P - VC) - FC (13.5)

Fixed Costs and Operating Leverage
Changes in fixed operating costs affect operating leverage significantly. Firms 
sometimes can alter the mix of fixed and variable costs in their operations. 
For example, a firm could make fixed-dollar lease payments rather than pay￾ments equal to a specified percentage of sales. or it could compensate sales rep￾resentatives with a fixed salary and bonus rather than on a pure percent-of-sales 
commission basis. The effects of changes in fixed operating costs on operating 
leverage can best be illustrated by continuing our example.
Assume that Cheryl’s Posters eliminates sales commissions and increases salaries. 
This exchange results in a reduction in the variable cost per unit from $5 to $4.50 
and an increase in the fixed costs from $2,500 to $3,000. Table 13.5 presents an 
analysis like that in Table 13.4, but using the new costs. Although the EBIT of 
$2,500 at the 1,000-unit sales level is the same as before the shift in cost struc￾ture, Table 13.5 shows that the firm has increased its operating leverage by in￾creasing fixed costs and lowering variable costs.
With the substitution of the appropriate values into Equation 13.5, the de￾gree of operating leverage at the 1,000-unit base level of sales becomes
DOL at 1,000 units =
1,000 * ($10 - $4.50)
1,000 * ($10 - $4.50) - $3,000 =
$5,500
$2,500 = 2.2
Comparing this value to the DOL of 2.0 before the shift to more fixed costs makes 
it clear that the higher the firm’s fixed operating costs relative to variable operat￾ing costs, the greater the degree of operating leverage. Under the new cost struc￾ture, a 50% change in sales would lead to a 110% (50% 3 2.2) change in EBIT.
FINANCIAL LEVERAGE
Financial leverage results from the presence of fixed financial costs that the firm 
must pay. Using the framework in Table 13.1, we can define financial leverage
as the use of fixed financial costs to magnify the effects of changes in earnings

before interest and taxes on the firm’s earnings per share. The two most com￾mon fixed financial costs are (1) interest on debt and (2) preferred stock divi￾dends. These charges must be paid regardless of the amount of EBIT available 
to pay them.7
Chen Foods, a small Asian food company, expects EBIT of $10,000 in the cur￾rent year. It has a $20,000 bond with a 10% (annual) coupon rate of interest and 
an issue of 600 shares of $4 (annual dividend per share) preferred stock outstand￾ing. It also has 1,000 shares of common stock outstanding. The annual interest 
on the bond issue is $2,000 (0.10 3 $20,000). The annual dividends on the pre￾ferred stock are $2,400 ($4.00/share 3 600 shares). Table 13.6 presents the earn￾ings per share (EPS) corresponding to levels of EBIT of $6,000, $10,000, and 
$14,000, assuming that the firm is in the 40% tax bracket. The table illustrates 
two situations:
Case 1 A 40% increase in EBIT (from $10,000 to $14,000) results in a 
100% increase in earnings per share (from $2.40 to $4.80).
Case 2 A 40% decrease in EBIT (from $10,000 to $6,000) results in a 100% 
decrease in earnings per share (from $2.40 to $0).
Example 13.8 ▶
7. Although a firm’s board of directors can elect to stop paying preferred stock dividends, the firm typically cannot 
pay dividends on common stock until the preferred shareholders receive all the dividends that they are owed. Al￾though failure to pay preferred dividends cannot force the firm into bankruptcy, it increases the common stockhold￾ers’ risk because they cannot receive dividends until the claims of preferred stockholders are satisfied.

The effect of financial leverage is such that an increase in the firm’s EBIT

other words, the base level of EBIT must be held constant to compare the financial leverage associated with different 
levels of fixed financial costs.

 DFL =
Percentage change in EPS
Percentage change in EBIT (13.6)
Whenever the percentage change in EPS resulting from a given percentage change 
in EBIT is greater than the percentage change in EBIT, financial leverage exists. In 
other words, whenever DFL is greater than 1, there is financial leverage.
Applying Equation 13.6 to cases 1 and 2 in Table 13.6 yields the following two 
cases:
Case 1 
+100,
+40,
= 2.5
Case 2 -100,
-40,
= 2.5
These calculations show that when Chen Foods’ EBIT changes, its EPS changes 
2.5 times as fast on a percentage basis due to the firm’s financial leverage. The 
higher this value is, the greater the degree of financial leverage.
Shanta and Ravi Shandra wish to assess the impact effect of 
additional long-term borrowing on their degree of financial 
leverage (DFL). The Shandras currently have $4,200 available after meeting all 
their monthly living (operating) expenses, before making monthly loan pay￾ments. They currently have monthly loan payment obligations of $1,700 and 
are considering the purchase of a new car, which would result in a $500 per 
month increase (to $2,200) in their total monthly loan payments. Because a 
large portion of Ravi’s monthly income represents commissions, the Shandras 
believe that the $4,200 per month currently available for making loan pay￾ments could vary by 20% above or below that amount.
To assess the potential impact of the additional borrowing on their financial 
leverage, the Shandras calculate their DFL for both their current ($1,700) and 
proposed ($2,200) loan payments as shown on the next page using the currently 
available $4,200 as a base and a 20% change.
Based on their calculations, the amount the Shandras will have available 
after loan payments with their current debt changes by 1.68% for every 1% 
change in the amount they will have available for making the loan payments. 
Example 13.9 ▶
Personal Finance Example 13.10 ▶ChAPTER 13   Leverage and Capital Structure 571
This change is considerably less responsive—and therefore less risky—than the 
2.10% change in the amount available after loan payments for each 1% change 
in the amount available for making loan payments with the proposed addi￾tional $500 in monthly debt payments. Although it appears that the Shandras 
can afford the additional loan payments, they must decide if, given the variabil￾ity of Ravi’s income, they are comfortable with the increased financial leverage 
and risk.

base level of EBIT is given by Equation 13.7, where the notation from Table 13.6 
is used.9
 Note that in the denominator the term 1/(1 2 T) converts the after-tax 
preferred stock dividend to a before-tax amount for consistency with the other 
terms in the equation.

base-level EPS is positive.

TOTAL LEVERAGE
We also can assess the combined effect of operating and financial leverage on the 
firm’s risk by using a framework similar to that used to develop the individual 
concepts of leverage. This combined effect, or total leverage, can be defined as the 
use of fixed costs, both operating and financial, to magnify the effects of changes 
in sales on the firm’s earnings per share. Total leverage can therefore be viewed as 
the total impact of the fixed costs in the firm’s operating and financial structure.
Cables, Inc., a computer cable manufacturer, expects sales of 20,000 units at $5 per 
unit in the coming year and must meet the following obligations: variable operating 
costs of $2 per unit, fixed operating costs of $10,000, interest of $20,000, and pre￾ferred stock dividends of $12,000. The firm is in the 40% tax bracket and has 5,000 
shares of common stock outstanding. Table 13.7 presents the levels of earnings per 
share associated with the expected sales of 20,000 units and with sales of 30,000 units.
Table 13.7 illustrates that as a result of a 50% increase in sales (from 20,000 
to 30,000 units), the firm would experience a 300% increase in earnings per share 
(from $1.20 to $4.80). Although it is not shown in the table, a 50% decrease in 
sales would, conversely, result in a 300% decrease in earnings per share. The linear 
nature of the leverage relationship accounts for the fact that sales changes of equal 
magnitude in opposite directions result in EPS changes of equal magnitude in the 
corresponding direction. At this point, it should be clear that whenever a firm has 
fixed costs—operating or financial—in its structure, total leverage will exist.

Measuring the degree of Total Leverage (dTL)
The degree of total leverage (DTL) is a numerical measure of the firm’s total le￾verage. It can be computed much like operating and financial leverage are com￾puted. One approach for measuring DTL is10
degree of total leverage (DTL)
The numerical measure of the 
firm’s total leverage.
10. This approach is valid only when the same base level of sales is used to calculate and compare these values. In 
other words, the base level of sales must be held constant if we are to compare the total leverage associated with 
different levels of fixed costs.
11. By using the formula for DTL in Equation 13.9, it is possible to get a negative value for the DTL if the EPS for 
the base level of sales is negative. For our purposes, rather than show absolute value signs in the equation, we in￾stead assume that the base-level EPS is positive.
 DTL =
Percentage change in EPS
Percentage change in sales (13.8)
Whenever the percentage change in EPS resulting from a given percentage change 
in sales is greater than the percentage change in sales, total leverage exists. In 
other words, as long as the DTL is greater than 1, there is total leverage.
Applying Equation 13.8 to the data in Table 13.7 yields
DTL =
+300,
+50,
= 6.0
Because this result is greater than 1, total leverage exists. The higher the value is, 
the greater the degree of total leverage.
A more direct formula for calculating the degree of total leverage at a given base 
level of sales, Q, is given by the following equation,11 which uses the same nota￾tion that was presented earlier:

calculating the degree of total leverage than the approach illustrated using Table 
13.7 and Equation 13.8.

Relationship of Operating, Financial, and Total Leverage
Total leverage reflects the combined impact of operating and financial leverage 
on the firm. High operating leverage and high financial leverage will cause total 
leverage to be high. The opposite will also be true. The relationship between op￾erating leverage and financial leverage is multiplicative rather than additive. The 
relationship between the degree of total leverage (DTL) and the degrees of oper￾ating leverage (DOL) and financial leverage (DFL) is given by
DTL = DOL * DFL (13.10)
Substituting the values calculated for DOL and DFL, shown on the right-hand 
side of Table 13.7, into Equation 13.10 yields
DTL = 1.2 * 5.0 = 6.0
The resulting degree of total leverage is the same value that we calculated directly 
in the preceding examples.
The Focus on Ethics box considers some ethical issues relating to the topic of 
leverage.
Example 13.15 ▶
Lehman Brothers’ fall 
was perhaps the most 
stunning development of the financial 
crisis. Dating back to the mid-1800s, 
the firm had survived the Great Depres￾sion and numerous recessions to be￾come a major player on Wall Street 
and around the world. Lehman’s busi￾ness included investment banking, 
sales, research and trading, investment 
management, private equity, and pri￾vate banking. Lehman was also a major 
player in the subprime mortgage indus￾try, which would ultimately lead to the 
firm’s undoing.
In the years before the subprime 
mortgage crisis, financial firms bor￾rowed heavily, and Lehman was no 
exception. By early 2008, Lehman had 
$32 in debt for each $1 in equity. That 
much leverage implied that a small 
drop in the value of Lehman’s assets 
could wipe out the firm.
Lehman’s exposure to the sub￾prime mortgage industry left it vulnera￾ble during the crisis. As its financial 
health deteriorated, Lehman used off–
balance sheet transactions to hide the 
extent of its indebtednesses. The trans￾actions, known within Lehman as 
Repo 105s, were executed near the 
end of each quarter, just before 
Lehman filed its quarterly financial 
reports. In these repos, Lehman sold 
some of its assets with an agreement 
to buy them back (with interest) a few 
days later. Lehman used the cash from 
the asset sale to pay down other lia￾bilities. The Repo 105 transactions 
enabled Lehman to reduce both total 
liabilities and total assets and allowed 
the firm to report lower leverage 
ratios. With the start of a new quarter, 
Lehman would unwind the transactions 
and restore the liabilities to their bal￾ance sheet.
The effects of Lehman’s Repo 105 
transactions were sizable, allowing the 
firm to briefly remove as much as $50 
billion in debt from its balance sheet. 
Because Lehman did not detail the Repo 
105 transactions in its financial state￾ments, outsiders were unaware of the 
transactions. Within Lehman, concerns 
were raised over the Repo 105 pro￾gram. The firm’s global financial control￾ler warned of the reputational risk to 
Lehman if the public became aware of 
the firm’s reliance on such transactions.
▶ Assume that Lehman’s Repo 105 
transactions fall within the limits al￾lowed by generally accepted account￾ing principles as Lehman’s manage￾ment has argued. What are the 
ethical implications of undertaking 
transactions expressly to temporarily

borrowed?

 13.2 The Firm’s Capital Structure
Capital structure is one of the most complex areas of financial decision making 
because of its interrelationship with other financial decision variables. Poor capi￾tal structure decisions can result in a high cost of capital, thereby lowering the 
NPVs of projects and making more of them unacceptable. Effective capital struc￾ture decisions can lower the cost of capital, resulting in higher NPVs and more 
acceptable projects and thereby increasing the value of the firm.
TYPES OF CAPITAL
All the items on the right-hand side of the firm’s balance sheet, excluding current liabil￾ities, are sources of capital. The following simplified balance sheet illustrates the basic 
breakdown of total capital into its two components, debt capital and equity capital:
Balance Sheet
Long-term debt
Assets Stockholders’ equity
 Preferred stock
 Common stock equity
 Common stock
 Retained earnings
Current liabilities
Equity
capital
Debt
capital
Total
capital
The cost of debt is lower than the cost of other forms of financing. Lenders de￾mand relatively lower returns because they take the least risk of any contributors of 
long-term capital. Lenders have a higher priority of claim against any earnings or 
assets available for payment, and they can exert far greater legal pressure against the 
company to make payment than can owners of preferred or common stock. The tax 
deductibility of interest payments also lowers the debt cost to the firm substantially.
MyFinancelab Video576 PART 6   Long-Term Financial Decisions
Unlike debt capital, which the firm must eventually repay, equity capital re￾mains invested in the firm indefinitely; it has no maturity date. The two main sources 
of equity capital are (1) preferred stock and (2) common stock equity, which in￾cludes common stock and retained earnings. Common stock is typically the most 
expensive form of equity, followed by retained earnings and then preferred stock. 
Our concern here is the relationship between debt and equity capital. In general, the 
more debt a firm uses, the greater will be the firm’s financial leverage. That leverage 
makes the claims of common stockholders even more risky. In addition, a firm that 
increases its use of leverage significantly can see its cost of debt rise as lenders begin 
to worry about the firm’s ability to repay its debts. Whether the firm borrows very 
little or a great deal, it is always true that the claims of common stockholders are 
riskier than those of lenders, so the cost of equity always exceeds the cost of debt.
ExTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF CAPITAL STRuCTuRE
We saw earlier that financial leverage results from the use of fixed-cost financing, 
such as debt and preferred stock, to magnify return and risk. The amount of lever￾age in the firm’s capital structure can affect its value by affecting return and risk. 
Those outside the firm can make a rough assessment of capital structure by using 
measures found in the firm’s financial statements. Some of these important debt 
ratios were presented in Chapter 3. For example, a direct measure of the degree of 
indebtedness is the debt ratio (total liabilities 4 total assets). The higher this ratio 
is, the greater the relative amount of debt (or financial leverage) in the firm’s capital 
structure. Measures of the firm’s ability to meet contractual payments associated 
with debt include the times interest earned ratio (EBIT 4 interest) and the fixed￾payment coverage ratio (see page 127). These ratios provide indirect information 
on financial leverage. Generally, the smaller these ratios, the greater the firm’s 
 financial leverage and the less able it is to meet payments as they come due.
The level of debt (financial leverage) that is acceptable for one industry or 
line of business can be highly risky in another, because different industries and 
lines of business have different operating characteristics. Table 13.8 presents the 
debt and times interest earned ratios for selected industries and lines of business. 
Significant industry differences can be seen in these data. Differences in debt posi￾tions are also likely to exist within an industry or line of business.
Those who lend to individuals, like lenders to corporations, 
typically use ratios to assess the applicant’s ability to meet the 
contractual payments associated with the requested debt. The lender, after obtain￾ing information from a loan application and other sources, calculates ratios and 
compares them to predetermined allowable values. Typically, if the applicant’s ra￾tio values are within the acceptable range, the lender will make the requested loan.
The best example of this process is a real estate mortgage loan application. 
The mortgage lender usually invokes the following two requirements:
 1. Monthly mortgage payments , 25% to 30% of monthly gross (before-tax) 
income
 2. Total monthly installment payments (including the mortgage payment) ,
33% to 38% of monthly gross (before-tax) income
Assume that the Loo family is applying for a mortgage loan. The family’s 
monthly gross (before-tax) income is $5,380, and they currently have monthly 
Personal Finance Example 13.16 ▶ChAPTER 13   Leverage and Capital Structure 577
installment loan obligations that total $560. The $200,000 mortgage loan they 
are applying for will require monthly payments of $1,400. The lender requires 
(1) the monthly mortgage payment to be less than 28% of monthly gross income 
and (2) total monthly installment payments (including the mortgage payment) to 
be less than 37% of monthly gross income. The lender calculates and evaluates 
these ratios for the Loos, as shown below.
 1. Mort. pay. 4 Gross income 5 $1,400 4 $5,380 
5 26% , 28% maximum, therefore OK
 2. Tot. instal. pay. 4 Gross income 5 ($560 1 $1,400) 4 $5,380 
5 $1,960 4 $5,380 
5 36.4% , 37% maximum, therefore OK
The Loos’ ratios meet the lender’s standards. So, assuming that they have ade￾quate funds for the down payment and meet other lender requirements, the Loos 
will be granted the loan.
CAPITAL STRuCTuRE OF NON–u.S. FIRMS
In general, non–U.S. companies have much higher degrees of indebtedness than 
their U.S. counterparts. Most of the reasons are because U.S. capital markets are 
more developed than those elsewhere and have played a greater role in corporate 
financing than has been the case in other countries. In most European countries,

and especially in Japan and other Pacific Rim nations, large commercial banks 
are more actively involved in the financing of corporate activity than has been 
true in the United States. Furthermore, in many of these countries, banks are al￾lowed to make large equity investments in nonfinancial corporations, a practice 
prohibited for U.S. banks. Finally, share ownership tends to be more tightly con￾trolled among founding-family, institutional, and even public investors in Europe 
and Asia than it is for most large U.S. corporations. Tight ownership enables 
owners to understand the firm’s financial condition better, resulting in their will￾ingness to tolerate a higher degree of indebtedness.

and (4) investor ability to borrow at the same rate as corporations.
Matter of fact
A study of the use of long-term debt in 42 countries found that firms in Argentina used more 
long-term debt than firms in any other country. Relative to their assets, firms in Argentina 
used almost 60 percent more long-term debt than did U.S. companies. Indian firms were heavy 
users of long-term debt as well. At the other end of the spectrum, companies from Italy, Greece, 
and Poland used very little long-term debt. In those countries, firms used only about 40 percent as 
much long-term debt as did their U.S. counterparts.
Leverage around the World
On the other hand, similarities do exist between U.S. corporations and corpora￾tions in other countries. First, the same industry patterns of capital structure tend to 
be found all around the world. For example, in nearly all countries, pharmaceutical 
and other high-growth industrial firms tend to have lower debt ratios than do steel 
companies, airlines, and electric utility companies. In part, it has to do with the na￾ture of assets held by these firms. High-growth firms whose main assets are intan￾gibles (such as patents and rights to intellectual property) tend to borrow less than 
firms that have tangible assets that can be pledged as collateral for loans. Second, 
the capital structures of the largest U.S.–based multinational companies, which have 
access to capital markets around the world, typically resemble the capital structures 
of multinational companies from other countries more than they resemble those of 
smaller U.S. companies. In other words, in most countries there is a tendency for 
larger firms to borrow more than smaller firms do. Third, companies that are riskier 
and have more volatile income streams tend to borrow less, as do firms that are 
highly profitable. Finally, the worldwide trend is away from reliance on banks for 
financing and toward greater reliance on security issuance. Over time, the differ￾ences in the capital structures of U.S. and non–U.S. firms will probably lessen.
CAPITAL STRuCTuRE ThEORY
Research suggests that there is an optimal capital structure range. It is not yet 
possible to provide financial managers with a precise methodology for determin￾ing a firm’s optimal capital structure. Nevertheless, financial theory does offer 
help in understanding how a firm’s capital structure affects the firm’s value.
In 1958, Franco Modigliani and Merton H. Miller12 (commonly known as 
“M and M”) demonstrated mathematically that, assuming perfect markets,13 the ChAPTER 13   Leverage and Capital Structure 579
capital structure that a firm chooses does not affect its value. Many researchers, 
including M and M, have examined whether capital structure may in fact affect 
firm value in imperfect, real-world markets. The result is a theoretical optimal
capital structure based on balancing the benefits and costs of debt financing. The 
major benefit of debt financing is the tax shield, which allows interest payments 
to be deducted in calculating taxable income. The cost of debt financing results 
from (1) the increased probability of bankruptcy caused by debt obligations, (2) 
the agency costs of the lender’s constraining the firm’s actions, and (3) the costs 
associated with managers having more information about the firm’s prospects 
than do investors.
Tax Benefits
Allowing firms to deduct interest payments on debt when calculating taxable in￾come reduces the amount of the firm’s earnings paid in taxes, thereby making 
more earnings available for bondholders and stockholders. The deductibility of 
interest means the cost of debt, ri
, to the firm is subsidized by the government. 
Letting rd
 equal the before-tax cost of debt and letting T equal the tax rate, from 
Chapter 9 (Equation 9.2), we have ri = rd * (1 - T).
Probability of Bankruptcy
The chance that a firm will become bankrupt because of an inability to meet its 
obligations as they come due depends largely on its levels of both business risk 
and financial risk.
Business Risk We define business risk as the risk to the firm of being unable 
to cover its operating costs. In general, the greater the firm’s operating leverage—
the use of fixed operating costs—the higher its business risk. Although operating 
leverage is an important factor affecting business risk, two other factors—revenue 
stability and cost stability—also affect it. Revenue stability reflects the relative 
variability of the firm’s sales revenues. Firms with stable levels of demand and 
product prices tend to have stable revenues. The result is low levels of business 
risk. Firms with highly volatile product demand and prices have unstable revenues 
that result in high levels of business risk. Cost stability reflects the relative predict￾ability of input prices such as those for labor and materials. The more predictable 
and stable these input prices are, the lower the business risk; the less predictable 
and stable they are, the higher the business risk.
Business risk varies among firms, regardless of their lines of business, and is 
not affected by capital structure decisions. The level of business risk must be taken 
as a “given.” The higher a firm’s business risk, the more cautious the firm must be 
in establishing its capital structure. Firms with high business risk therefore tend 
toward less highly leveraged capital structures, and firms with low business risk 
tend toward more highly leveraged capital structures. We will hold business risk 
constant throughout the discussions that follow.
Cooke Company, a soft drink manufacturer, is preparing to make a capital struc￾ture decision. It has obtained estimates of sales and the associated levels of earn￾ings before interest and taxes (EBIT) from its forecasting group: There is a 25% 
chance that sales will total $400,000, a 50% chance that sales will total $600,000, 
and a 25% chance that sales will total $800,000. Fixed operating costs total

to its investment.
$200,000, and variable operating costs equal 50% of sales. These data are sum￾marized, and the resulting EBIT calculated, in Table 13.9.
Table 13.9 shows that there is a 25% chance that the EBIT will be $0, a 50% 
chance that it will be $100,000, and a 25% chance that it will be $200,000. 
When developing the firm’s capital structure, the financial manager must accept 
as given these levels of EBIT and their associated probabilities. These EBIT data 
effectively reflect a certain level of business risk that captures the firm’s operating 
leverage, sales revenue variability, and cost predictability.
The penalty for not meeting financial obligations is bankruptcy. The more 
fixed-cost financing—debt (including financial leases) and preferred stock—a 
firm has in its capital structure, the greater its financial leverage and risk. Finan￾cial risk depends on the capital structure decision made by the management, and 
that decision is affected by the business risk the firm faces.
Total Risk The total risk of a firm—business and financial risk combined—
determines its probability of bankruptcy. Financial risk, its relationship to busi￾ness risk, and their combined impact can be demonstrated by continuing the 
Cooke Company example.
Cooke Company’s current capital structure is as follows: Example 13.18 ▶
Let us assume that the firm is considering seven alternative capital structures. If 
we measure these structures using the debt ratio, they are associated with ratios 
of 0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60%. Assuming that (1) the firm has 
no current liabilities, (2) its capital structure currently contains all equity as 
shown, and (3) the total amount of capital remains constant14 at $500,000, the ChAPTER 13   Leverage and Capital Structure 581
mix of debt and equity associated with the seven debt ratios would be as shown 
in Table 13.10. Also shown in the table is the number of shares of common stock 
outstanding under each alternative.
Associated with each of the debt levels in column 3 of Table 13.10 would be 
an interest rate that would be expected to increase with increases in financial le￾verage. The level of debt, the associated interest rate (assumed to apply to all
debt), and the dollar amount of annual interest associated with each of the alter￾native capital structures are summarized in Table 13.11. Because both the level of 
debt and the interest rate increase with increasing financial leverage (debt ratios), 
the annual interest increases as well.
Table 13.12 uses the levels of EBIT and associated probabilities developed in 
Table 13.9, the number of shares of common stock found in column 5 of Table 
13.10, and the annual interest values calculated in column 3 of Table 13.11 to 
calculate the earnings per share (EPS) for debt ratios of 0%, 30%, and 60%.

It is assumed that the firm receives the tax benefit from its loss in the current period as a result of applying 
the tax loss carryback procedures specified in the tax law but not discussed in this text.ChAPTER 13   Leverage and Capital Structure 583
Table 13.13 summarizes the pertinent data for the seven alternative capital 
structures. The values shown for 0%, 30%, and 60% debt ratios were developed 
in Table 13.12; calculations of similar values for the other debt ratios (10%, 
20%, 40%, and 50%) are not shown. Because the coefficient of variation mea￾sures the risk relative to the expected EPS, it is the preferred risk measure for use 
in comparing capital structures. As the firm’s financial leverage increases, so does 
its coefficient of variation of EPS. As expected, an increasing level of risk is asso￾ciated with increased levels of financial leverage.
The relative risks of the two extremes of the capital structures evaluated in 
Table 13.12 (debt ratios 5 0% and 60%) can be illustrated by showing the prob￾ability distribution of EPS associated with each of them. Figure 13.3 shows these

two distributions. The expected level of EPS increases with increasing financial 
leverage, and so does risk as reflected by the difference in dispersion between the 
distributions. Clearly, the uncertainty of the expected EPS, as well as the chance 
of experiencing negative EPS, is greater when higher degrees of financial leverage 
are employed.
Further, the nature of the risk–return trade-off associated with the seven cap￾ital structures under consideration can be clearly observed by plotting the ex￾pected EPS and coefficient of variation relative to the debt ratio. Plotting the data 
from Table 13.13 results in Figure 13.4. The figure shows that as debt is substi￾tuted for equity (as the debt ratio increases), the level of EPS rises and then begins 
to fall (graph a). The graph demonstrates that the peak of earnings per share oc￾curs at a debt ratio of 50%. The decline in earnings per share beyond that ratio 
results from the fact that the significant increases in interest are not fully offset by 
the reduction in the number of shares of common stock outstanding.
If we look at the risk behavior as measured by the coefficient of variation 
(graph b), we can see that risk increases with increasing leverage. A portion of the 
risk can be attributed to business risk, but the portion that changes in response to 
increasing financial leverage would be attributed to financial risk.
Clearly, a risk–return trade-off exists relative to the use of financial leverage. 
Later in the chapter, we will address how to combine these risk–return factors 
into a valuation framework. The key point to recognize here is that as a firm 
introduces more leverage into its capital structure, it will typically experience 
increases in both the expected level of return and the associated risk.
Agency Costs Imposed by Lenders
As noted in Chapter 1, the managers of firms typically act as agents of the owners 
(stockholders). The owners give the managers the authority to manage the firm 
for the owners’ benefit. The agency problem created by this relationship extends 
not only to the relationship between owners and managers but also to the rela￾tionship between owners and lenders.ChAPTER 13   Leverage and Capital Structure 585
When a lender provides funds to a firm, the interest rate charged is based on 
the lender’s assessment of the firm’s risk. The lender–borrower relationship there￾fore depends on the lender’s expectations for the firm’s subsequent behavior. The 
borrowing rates are, in effect, locked in when the loans are negotiated. After ob￾taining a loan at a certain rate, the firm could increase its risk by investing in 
risky projects or by incurring additional debt. Such action could weaken the lend￾er’s position in terms of its claim on the cash flow of the firm. From another point 
of view, if these risky investment strategies paid off, the stockholders would ben￾efit. Because payment obligations to the lender remain unchanged, the excess 
cash flows generated by a positive outcome from the riskier action would en￾hance the value of the firm to its owners. In other words, if the risky investments 
pay off, the owners receive all the benefits; if the risky investments do not pay off, 
the lenders share in the costs.
Clearly, an incentive exists for the managers acting on behalf of the 
stockholders to “take advantage” of lenders. To avoid this situation, lenders 
impose certain monitoring techniques on borrowers, who as a result incur agency 
costs. The most obvious strategy is to deny subsequent loan requests or to increase 
the cost of future loans to the firm. But this strategy is an after-the-fact approach. 
Therefore, lenders typically protect themselves by including in the loan agreement 
provisions that limit the firm’s ability to alter its business and financial risk. These 
loan provisions tend to center on issues such as the minimum level of liquidity, 
asset acquisitions, executive salaries, and dividend payments.
By including appropriate provisions in the loan agreement, the lender can 
control the firm’s risk and thus protect itself against the adverse consequences of 
this agency problem. Of course, in exchange for incurring agency costs by agree￾ing to the operating and financial constraints placed on it by the loan provisions, 
the firm should benefit by obtaining funds at a lower cost.
Asymmetric Information
When two parties in an economic transaction have different information, we say 
that there is asymmetric information. In the context of capital structure decisions, 
asymmetric information simply means that managers of the firm have more in￾formation about the firm’s operations and future prospects than investors have. 
To understand how asymmetric information between managers and investors 
could have implications for a firm’s capital structure, consider the following illus￾tions of the pecking order and signaling theories.
Pecking Order Theory Suppose that managers of a firm have a highly prof￾itable investment opportunity that requires financing. Managers would like to 
tell investors about this great investment opportunity, but investors are skeptical. 
After all, managers always have incentives to claim that their investment deci￾sions will lead to fabulous profits, but investors have no way to verify these 
claims. If managers try to sell stock to finance the investments, investors are only 
willing to pay a price that reflects the verifiable information that they have, which 
means that managers have to sell stock at a discount (relative to the price that 
they could get if there were no asymmetric information). This situation makes 
raising new equity very costly, and sometimes managers may decide to pass up 
positive NPV investments to avoid having to sell equity to investors at a discount.
One solution to this problem is for managers to maintain financial slack, cash 
reserves from retained earnings that they can use to finance new investments. When 
asymmetric information
The situation in which 
managers of a firm have more 
information about operations 
and future prospects than do 
investors.586 PART 6   Long-Term Financial Decisions
firms do not have enough financial slack to finance their profitable investment op￾portunities, managers will prefer to raise external financing by issuing debt rather 
than equity. Providers of debt financing receive a fixed return, so when the new 
investment begins to generate high returns for the firm, those cash flows will largely 
go to the firm’s existing stockholders.
The consequence is that there is a financial pecking order, meaning a hierar￾chy of financing that begins with retained earnings, followed by debt, and finally 
new stock issues. When managers want to finance a new project, they will first do 
so using retained earnings. If internally generated cash is insufficient to fund new 
investments, managers will raise external financing through the debt markets. Is￾suing new equity is their last resort.
This pecking order theory is consistent with several facts about firms’ financing 
decisions. First, the vast majority of new investments are funded through retained 
earnings, with firms raising external financing infrequently. Second, firms do raise 
debt with greater frequency than equity as the pecking order theory predicts. Third, 
as we have already noted, there is a general tendency for profitable companies 
(who have plenty of financial slack) to borrow less than unprofitable firms.
Signaling Theory There is an old saying that goes, “Put your money where 
your mouth is.” The idea is that anyone can brag, but only those who are willing to 
put real dollars at stake behind their claims ought to be believed. How does this 
aphorism relate to capital structure decisions? Suppose, for example, that manage￾ment has information that the prospects for the firm’s future are very good. Man￾agers could issue a press release trying to convince investors that the firm’s future is 
bright, but investors will want tangible evidence for the claims. Furthermore, pro￾viding that evidence has to be costly to the firm; otherwise, other firms with less 
rosy prospects will just mimic the actions of the firm with truly excellent prospects. 
One thing that managers might do is to borrow a lot of money by issuing debt. In 
so doing, they are demonstrating to the market that they have faith that the firm 
will generate sufficient cash flows in the future to retire the outstanding debt. Firms 
whose prospects are not as good will hesitate to issue a lot of debt because they 
may have difficulty repaying the debt and may even go bankrupt. In other words, 
issuing debt is a credible signal that managers believe the firm’s performance will be 
very good in the future. Debt financing is a positive signal suggesting that manage￾ment believes that the stock is “undervalued” and therefore a bargain.
By the same token, when firms decide to issue stock, investors worry that this 
move could be a negative signal, indicating that managers believe that the firm’s 
future profitability may be rather poor and that the stock price is currently over￾valued. Therefore, investors often interpret the announcement of a stock issue as 
bad news, and the stock price declines.
Most research casts doubt on the importance of signaling as a primary deter￾minant of firms’ capital structure choices. For instance, we have already seen that 
the most profitable firms tend to borrow less, whereas the signaling theory says 
that profitable firms should borrow more as a way to convince investors of just 
how high the firm’s future profits will be. Furthermore, in surveys that ask man￾agers to describe how they choose between debt and equity financing, managers 
rarely say that they choose debt as a way to convey information to investors. Still, 
the signaling theory predicts that a firm’s stock price should rise when it issues 
debt and fall when it issues equity, and that is exactly what happens in the real 
world much of the time.

OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRuCTuRE
What, then, is the optimal capital structure, even if it exists (so far) only in the￾ory? To provide some insight into an answer, we will examine some basic finan￾cial relationships. Because the value of a firm equals the present value of its future 
cash flows, it follows that the value of the firm is maximized when the cost of 
capital is minimized. In other words, the present value of future cash flows is at 
its highest when the discount rate (the cost of capital) is at its lowest. By using a 
modification of the simple zero-growth valuation model (see Equation 7.2 in 
Chapter 7), we can define the value of the firm, V, as
V =
EBIT * (1 - T)
ra
=
NOPAT
ra
(13.11)
where
 EBIT = earnings before interest and taxes
T = tax rate
NOPAT = net operating profits after taxes, which is the after￾tax operating earnings available to the debt and 
equity holders, EBIT 3 (1 2 T)
ra = weighted average cost of capital
Clearly, if we assume that NOPAT (and therefore EBIT) is constant, the value of 
the firm, V, is maximized by minimizing the weighted average cost of capital, ra
.
Cost Functions
Figure 13.5(a) plots three cost functions—the cost of debt, the cost of equity, and the 
weighted average cost of capital (WACC)—as a function of financial leverage 
measured by the debt ratio (debt to total assets). The cost of debt, ri
, remains low 
because of the tax shield, but it slowly increases as leverage increases, to compensate 
lenders for increasing risk. The cost of equity, rs
, is above the cost of debt. It increases 
as financial leverage increases, but it generally increases more rapidly than the cost of 
debt. The cost of equity rises because the stockholders require a higher return as 
leverage increases to compensate for the higher degree of financial risk.
The weighted average cost of capital, ra
, results from a weighted average of the 
firm’s debt and equity capital costs. At a debt ratio of zero, the firm is 100 percent 
equity financed. As debt is substituted for equity and as the debt ratio increases, the 
WACC declines because the after-tax debt cost is less than the equity cost (ri , rs
). 
In this range, the tax benefits of additional debt outweigh the costs of borrowing 
more. However, as the debt ratio continues to increase, the increased debt and eq￾uity costs eventually cause the WACC to rise, as can be seen after point M in Figure 
13.5(a). In other words, the bankruptcy costs, agency costs, and other costs associ￾ated with higher debt levels eventually outweigh the additional tax benefits that the 
firm could generate by borrowing even more. This behavior results in a U-shaped, 
or saucer-shaped, weighted average cost-of-capital function, ra
.
Graphical View of Optimal Structure
Because the maximization of value, V, is achieved when the overall cost of 
capital, ra
, is at a minimum (see Equation 13.11), the optimal capital structure
is that at which the weighted average cost of capital, ra
, is minimized. 
optimal capital structure
The capital structure at which 
the weighted average cost of 
capital is minimized, thereby 
maximizing the firm’s value.588 PART 6   Long-Term Financial Decisions
In Figure 13.5(a), point M represents the minimum weighted average cost of 
capital, the point of optimal financial leverage and hence of optimal capital 
structure for the firm. Figure 13.5(b) is a graph of the value of the firm that 
results from substitution of ra
 in Figure 13.5(a) for various levels of financial 
leverage into the zero-growth valuation model in Equation 13.11. As shown in 
Figure 13.5(b), at the optimal capital structure, point M, the value of the firm is 
maximized at V*.
Simply stated, minimizing the weighted average cost of capital allows man￾agement to undertake a larger number of profitable projects, thereby further in￾creasing the value of the firm. However, as a practical matter, there is no way to 
calculate the optimal capital structure implied by Figure 13.5. Because it is im￾possible either to know or to remain at the precise optimal capital structure, firms 
generally try to operate in a range that places them near what they believe to be 
the optimal capital structure. In other words, firms usually manage toward a tar￾get capital structure.

 13.3 EBIT–EPS Approach to Capital Structure
It should be clear from earlier chapters that the goal of the financial manager is to 
maximize owner wealth, that is, the firm’s stock price. One of the widely fol￾lowed variables affecting the firm’s stock price is its earnings, which represents 
the returns earned on behalf of owners. Even though focusing on earnings ignores 
risk (the other key variable affecting the firm’s stock price), earnings per share 
(EPS) can be conveniently used to analyze alternative capital structures. The 
EBIT–EPS approach to capital structure involves selecting the capital structure 
that maximizes EPS over the expected range of earnings before interest and taxes 
(EBIT).
PRESENTING A FINANCING PLAN GRAPhICALLY
To analyze the effects of a firm’s capital structure on the owners’ returns, we 
consider the relationship between earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and 
earnings per share (EPS). In other words, we want to see how changes in EBIT 
lead to changes in EPS under different capital structures. In all our examples, we 
will assume that business risk remains constant. That is, the firm’s basic opera￾tional risks remain constant, and only financial risk varies as capital structures 
change. EPS is used to measure the owners’ returns, which are expected to be 
closely related to share price.16
data Required
To draw a graph illustrating how changes in EBIT lead to changes in EPS, we 
simply need to find two coordinates and plot a straight line between them. On 
our graph, we will plot EBIT on the horizontal axis and EPS on the vertical axis. 
The following example illustrates the approach for constructing the graph.
EBIT–EPS approach
An approach for selecting the 
capital structure that maximizes 
earnings per share (EPS) over 
the expected range of earnings 
before interest and taxes (EBIT).
16. The relationship that is expected to exist between EPS and owner wealth is not one of cause and effect. As indi￾cated in Chapter 1, the maximization of profits does not necessarily ensure that owners’ wealth is also maximized. 
Nevertheless, it is expected that the movement of earnings per share will have some effect on owners’ wealth be￾cause EPS data constitute one of the few pieces of information investors receive, and they often bid the firm’s share 
price up or down in response to the level of these earnings.590 PART 6   Long-Term Financial Decisions
We can plot coordinates on the EBIT–EPS graph by assuming specific EBIT val￾ues and calculating the EPS associated with them.17 Such calculations for three 
capital structures—debt ratios of 0%, 30%, and 60%—for Cooke Company 
were presented in Table 13.12. For EBIT values of $100,000 and $200,000, the 
associated EPS values calculated there are summarized in the table below the 
graph in Figure 13.6.
Plotting the data
The Cooke Company data can be plotted on a set of EBIT–EPS axes as shown in 
Figure 13.6. The figure shows the level of EPS expected for each level of EBIT. 
For levels of EBIT below the x-axis intercept, a loss (negative EPS) results. Each 
of the x-axis intercepts is a financial breakeven point, the level of EBIT necessary 
to just cover all fixed financial costs (EPS 5 $0).
Example 13.19 ▶
17. A convenient method for finding one EBIT–EPS coordinate is to calculate the financial breakeven point, the level 
of EBIT for which the firm’s EPS just equals $0. It is the level of EBIT needed just to cover all fixed financial costs: 
annual interest (I) and preferred stock dividends (PD). The equation for the financial breakeven point is
Financial breakeven point = I +
PD
1 - T
where T is the tax rate. It can be seen that when PD = $0, the financial breakeven point is equal to I, the annual 
interest payment.

COMPARING ALTERNATIVE CAPITAL STRuCTuRES
We can compare alternative capital structures by graphing financing plans as 
shown in Figure 13.6.
Cooke Company’s capital structure alternatives were plotted on the EBIT–EPS 
axes in Figure 13.6. This figure shows that each capital structure is superior to 
the others in terms of maximizing EPS over certain ranges of EBIT. Having no 
debt at all (debt ratio 5 0%) is best for levels of EBIT between $0 and $50,000. 
That conclusion makes sense because when business conditions are relatively 
weak, Cooke would have difficulty meeting its financial obligations if it had any 
debt. Between $50,000 and $95,500 of EBIT, the capital structure associated 
with a debt ratio of 30% produces higher EPS than either of the other two capital 
structures. And when EBIT exceeds $95,500, the 60% debt ratio capital structure 
provides the highest earnings per share.18 Again, the intuition behind this result is 
fairly straightforward. When business is booming, the best thing for shareholders 
is for the firm to use a great deal of debt. The firm pays lenders a relatively low 
rate of return, and the shareholders keep the rest.
CONSIdERING RISK IN EBIT–EPS ANALYSIS
When interpreting EBIT–EPS analysis, it is important to consider the risk of each 
capital structure alternative. Graphically, the risk of each capital structure can be 
viewed in light of two measures: (1) the financial breakeven point (EBIT-axis in￾tercept) and (2) the degree of financial leverage reflected in the slope of the capi￾tal structure line: The higher the financial breakeven point and the steeper the 
slope of the capital structure line, the greater the financial risk.19
Further assessment of risk can be performed by using ratios. As financial le￾verage (measured by the debt ratio) increases, we expect a corresponding decline 
in the firm’s ability to make scheduled interest payments (measured by the times 
interest earned ratio).
Example 13.20 ▶
18. An algebraic technique can be used to find the indifference points between the capital structure alternatives. This 
technique involves expressing each capital structure as an equation stated in terms of earnings per share, setting the 
equations for two capital structures equal to each other, and solving for the level of EBIT that causes the equations 
to be equal. When we use the notation from footnote 17 and let n equal the number of shares of common stock 
outstanding, the general equation for the earnings per share from a financing plan is
EPS =
(1 - T) * (EBIT - I) - PD
n
Comparing Cooke Company’s 0% and 30% capital structures, we get
(1 - 0.40) * (EBIT - $0) - $0
25.00 =
(1 - 0.40) * (EBIT - $15.00) - $0
17.50
0.60 * EBIT
25.00 =
0.60 * EBIT - $9.00
17.50
 10.50 * EBIT = 15.00 * EBIT - $225.00
 $225.00 = 4.50 * EBIT
 EBIT = $50
The calculated value of the indifference point between the 0% and 30% capital structures is therefore $50,000, as 
can be seen in Figure 13.6.
19. The degree of financial leverage (DFL) is reflected in the slope of the EBIT–EPS function. The steeper the slope, 
the greater the degree of financial leverage, because the change in EPS (y axis) that results from a given change in 
EBIT (x axis) increases with increasing slope and decreases with decreasing slope.592 PART 6   Long-Term Financial Decisions
LG 6
Reviewing the three capital structures plotted for Cooke Company in Figure 
13.6, we can see that as the debt ratio increases, so does the financial risk of each 
alternative. Both the financial breakeven point and the slope of the capital struc￾ture lines increase with increasing debt ratios. If we use the $100,000 EBIT value, 
for example, the times interest earned ratio (EBIT 4 interest) for the zero-lever￾age capital structure is infinity ($100,000 4 $0); for the 30% debt case, it is 6.67 
($100,000 4 $15,000); and for the 60% debt case, it is 2.02 ($100,000 4
$49,500). Because lower times interest earned ratios reflect higher risk, these ra￾tios support the conclusion that the risk of the capital structures increases with 
increasing financial leverage. The capital structure for a debt ratio of 60% is 
riskier than that for a debt ratio of 30%, which in turn is riskier than the capital 
structure for a debt ratio of 0%.
BASIC ShORTCOMING OF EBIT–EPS ANALYSIS
The most important point to recognize when using EBIT–EPS analysis is that this 
technique tends to concentrate on maximizing earnings rather than maximizing 
owner wealth as reflected in the firm’s stock price. The use of an EPS-maximizing 
approach generally ignores risk. If investors did not require risk premiums (ad￾ditional returns) as the firm increased the proportion of debt in its capital struc￾ture, a strategy involving maximizing EPS would also maximize stock price. But 
because risk premiums increase with increases in financial leverage, the maximi￾zation of EPS does not ensure owner wealth maximization. To select the best 
capital structure, firms must integrate both return (EPS) and risk (via the required 
return, rs
) into a valuation framework consistent with the capital structure theory 
presented earlier.
➔ REVIEW QuESTION

explanation a graph indicating the financial breakeven point; label the 
axes. Is this approach consistent with maximization of the owners’ 
wealth?
 13.4 Choosing the Optimal Capital Structure
This section describes the procedures for linking to market value the return and 
risk associated with alternative capital structures.
LINKAGE
To determine the firm’s value under alternative capital structures, the firm must 
find the level of return that it must earn to compensate owners for the risk being 
incurred. This approach is consistent with the overall valuation framework devel￾oped in Chapters 6 and 7 and applied to capital budgeting decisions in Chapters 
10 through 12.
Example 13.21 ▶ChAPTER 13   Leverage and Capital Structure 593
The required return associated with a given level of financial risk can be esti￾mated in a number of ways. Theoretically, the preferred approach would be first 
to estimate the beta associated with each alternative capital structure and then to 
use the CAPM framework presented in Equation 8.8 to calculate the required re￾turn, rs
. A more operational approach involves linking the financial risk associ￾ated with each capital structure alternative directly to the required return. Such an 
approach is similar to the CAPM-type approach demonstrated in Chapter 12 for 
linking project risk and required return (RADR). Here it involves estimating the 
required return associated with each level of financial risk as measured by a statis￾tic such as the coefficient of variation of EPS. Regardless of the approach used, 
one would expect the required return to increase as the financial risk increases.
Cooke Company, using as risk measures the coefficients of variation of EPS 
associated with each of the seven alternative capital structures, estimated the as￾sociated required returns, which are shown in Table 13.14. As expected, the esti￾mated required return of owners, rs
, increases with increasing risk, as measured 
by the coefficient of variation of EPS.
ESTIMATING VALuE
The value of the firm associated with alternative capital structures can be esti￾mated using one of the standard valuation models. If, for simplicity, we assume 
that all earnings are paid out as dividends, we can use a standard zero-growth 
valuation model such as that developed in Chapter 7. The model, originally stated 
in Equation 7.2, is restated here with EPS substituted for dividends (because in 
each year the dividends would equal EPS):
Example 13.22 ▶
P0 =
EPS
rs
(13.12)
By substituting the expected level of EPS and the associated required return, rs

into Equation 13.12, we can estimate the per-share value of the firm, P0
.

We can now estimate the value of Cooke Company’s stock under each of the alter￾native capital structures. Substituting the expected EPS (column 1 of Table 13.13) 
and the required returns, rs
 (column 2 of Table 13.14 in decimal form), into Equa￾tion 13.12 for each of the capital structures, we obtain the share values given in 
column 3 of Table 13.15. Plotting the resulting share values against the associated 
debt ratios, as shown in Figure 13.7, clearly illustrates that the maximum share 
value occurs at the capital structure associated with a debt ratio of 30%.

MAxIMIZING VALuE VERSuS MAxIMIZING EPS
Throughout this text, we have specified the goal of the financial manager as 
maximizing owner wealth, not profit. Although some relationship exists 
between expected profit and value, there is no reason to believe that profit￾maximizing strategies necessarily result in wealth maximization. It is therefore 
the wealth of the owners as reflected in the estimated share value that should 
serve as the criterion for selecting the best capital structure. A final look at 
Cooke Company will highlight this point.
Further analysis of Figure 13.7 clearly shows that although the firm’s profits 
(EPS) are maximized at a debt ratio of 50%, share value is maximized at a 30% 
debt ratio. Therefore, the preferred capital structure would be the 30% debt ra￾tio. The two approaches provide different conclusions because EPS maximization 
does not consider risk.
SOME OThER IMPORTANT CONSIdERATIONS
Because there is really no practical way to calculate the optimal capital structure, 
any quantitative analysis of capital structure must be tempered with other impor￾tant considerations. Table 13.16 summarizes some of the more important addi￾tional factors involved in capital structure decisions.
Example 13.24 ▶
Important Factors to Consider in Making Capital Structure Decisions
Concern Factor Description
Business risk Revenue stability Firms that have stable and predictable revenues can more 
safely undertake highly leveraged capital structures than 
can firms with volatile patterns of sales revenue. Firms with 
growing sales tend to benefit from added debt; they can reap 
the positive benefits of financial leverage, which magnifies the 
effect of these increases.
  Cash flow When considering a new capital structure, the firm must focus on 
its ability to generate the cash flows necessary to meet obligations. 
Cash forecasts reflecting an ability to service debts (and preferred 
stock) must support any shift in capital structure.
Agency costs Contractual obligations A firm may be contractually constrained with respect to the type 
of funds that it can raise. For example, a firm might be prohibited 
from selling additional debt except when the claims of holders of 
such debt are made subordinate to the existing debt. Contractual 
constraints on the sale of additional stock, as well as on the ability 
to distribute dividends on stock, might also exist.
  Management preferences Occasionally, a firm will impose an internal constraint on the use 
of debt to limit its risk exposure to a level deemed acceptable to 
management. In other words, because of risk aversion, the firm’s 
management constrains the firm’s capital structure at a level that 
may or may not be the true optimum.

(Continued)596 PART 6   Long-Term Financial Decisions
➔ REVIEW QuESTIONS
13–14 Why do maximizing EPS and maximizing value not necessarily lead to 
the same conclusion about the optimal capital structure?
13–15 What important factors in addition to quantitative factors should a firm 
consider when it is making a capital structure decision?
Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
The amount of leverage (fixed-cost assets or funds) employed by a firm directly 
affects its risk, return, and share value. Generally, higher leverage raises risk and 
return, and lower leverage reduces risk and return. Operating leverage concerns 
the level of fixed operating costs; financial leverage focuses on fixed financial 
costs, particularly interest on debt and any preferred stock dividends. The firm’s 
capital structure determines its financial leverage. Because of its fixed interest 
payments, the more debt a firm employs relative to its equity, the greater its 
financial leverage.
The value of the firm is clearly affected by its degree of operating leverage 
and by the composition of its capital structure. The financial manager must 
therefore carefully consider the types of operating and financial costs the firm 
will incur, recognizing that higher risk comes with greater fixed costs. Major 
decisions with regard to both operating cost structure and capital structure must 
therefore focus on their impact on the firm’s value. The firm should implement 
only those leverage and capital structure decisions that are consistent with its 
goal of maximizing its stock price.
TABLE 13.16 Important Factors to Consider in Making Capital Structure Decisions (continued)
  Control A management group concerned about control may prefer to 
issue debt rather than (voting) common stock. Under favorable 
market conditions, a firm that wanted to sell equity could make 
a preemptive offering or issue nonvoting shares, allowing each 
shareholder to maintain proportionate ownership. Generally, only 
in closely held firms or firms threatened by takeover does control 
become a major concern in the capital structure decision.
Asymmetric information External risk assessment The firm’s ability to raise funds quickly and at favorable rates de￾pends on the external risk assessments of lenders and bond raters. 
The firm must consider the impact of capital structure decisions 
both on share value and on published financial statements from 
which lenders and raters assess the firm’s risk.
  Timing At times when interest rates are low, debt financing might be 
more attractive; when interest rates are high, the sale of stock 
may be more appealing. Sometimes both debt and equity capital 
become unavailable at reasonable terms. General economic 
conditions—especially those of the capital market—can thus 
significantly affect capital structure decisions.ChAPTER 13   Leverage and Capital Structure 597
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
LG 1 Discuss leverage, capital structure, breakeven analysis, the operating 
breakeven point, and the effect of changing costs on the breakeven point. Leverage 
results from the use of fixed costs to magnify returns to a firm’s owners. Capital 
structure, the firm’s mix of long-term debt and equity, affects leverage and therefore 
the firm’s value. Breakeven analysis measures the level of sales necessary to cover 
total operating costs. The operating breakeven point may be calculated algebraically 
by dividing fixed operating costs by the difference between the sale price per unit 
and variable operating cost per unit, or it may be determined graphically. The 
operating breakeven point increases with increased fixed and variable operating 
costs and decreases with an increase in sale price, and vice versa.
LG 2 Understand operating, financial, and total leverage and the relationships 
among them. Operating leverage is the use of fixed operating costs by the 
firm to magnify the effects of changes in sales on EBIT. The higher the fixed 
operating costs, the greater the operating leverage. Financial leverage is the use 
of fixed financial costs by the firm to magnify the effects of changes in EBIT 
on EPS. The higher the fixed financial costs, the greater the financial leverage. 
The total leverage of the firm is the use of fixed costs—both operating and 
financial—to magnify the effects of changes in sales on EPS.
LG 3 Describe the types of capital, external assessment of capital structure, the 
capital structure of non–U.S. firms, and capital structure theory. Debt capital 
and equity capital make up a firm’s capital structure. Capital structure can be 
externally assessed by using financial ratios: debt ratio, times interest earned 
ratio, and fixed-payment coverage ratio. Non–U.S. companies tend to have 
much higher degrees of indebtedness than do their U.S. counterparts, primarily 
because U.S. capital markets are more developed.
Research suggests that there is an optimal capital structure that balances the 
firm’s benefits and costs of debt financing. The major benefit of debt financing 
is the tax shield. The costs of debt financing include the probability of 
bankruptcy, agency costs imposed by lenders, and asymmetric information, 
which typically causes firms to raise funds in a pecking order so as to send 
positive signals to the market and thereby enhance shareholder wealth.
LG 4 Explain the optimal capital structure using a graphical view of the firm’s cost￾of-capital functions and a zero-growth valuation model. The zero-growth valuation 
model defines the firm’s value as its net operating profits after taxes (NOPAT), or 
after-tax EBIT, divided by its weighted average cost of capital. Assuming that 
NOPAT is constant, the value of the firm is maximized by minimizing its weighted 
average cost of capital (WACC). The optimal capital structure minimizes the WACC. 
Graphically, the firm’s WACC exhibits a U-shape curve whose minimum value 
defines the optimal capital structure that maximizes owner wealth.
LG 5 Discuss the EBIT–EPS approach to capital structure. The EBIT–EPS 
approach evaluates capital structures in light of the returns they provide the 
firm’s owners and their degree of financial risk. Under the EBIT–EPS approach, 
the preferred capital structure is the one that is expected to provide maximum 
EPS over the firm’s expected range of EBIT. Graphically, this approach reflects 598 PART 6   Long-Term Financial Decisions
risk in terms of the financial breakeven point and the slope of the capital 
structure line. The major shortcoming of EBIT–EPS analysis is that it 
concentrates on maximizing earnings (returns) rather than owners’ wealth, 
which considers risk as well as return.
LG 6
 Review the return and risk of alternative capital structures, their linkage 
to market value, and other important considerations related to capital structure.
The best capital structure can be selected by using a valuation model to link return 
and risk factors. The preferred capital structure is the one that results in the highest 
estimated share value, not the highest EPS. Other important nonquantitative factors 
must also be considered when making capital structure decisions.

Little by little, demand for the figurines, now called Mollycaits, grew, and the 
sisters began to reproduce some of the favorites in resin, using molds of the 
originals. The day came when a buyer for a major department store offered them 
a contract to produce 1,500 figurines of various designs for $10,000. Molly and 
Caitlin realized that it was time to get down to business. To make bookkeeping 
simpler, Molly had priced all the figurines at $8.00 each. Variable operating 
costs amounted to an average of $6.00 per unit. To produce the order, Molly 
and Caitlin would have to rent industrial facilities for a month, which would 
cost them $4,000.
a. Calculate Mollycaits’ operating breakeven point.
b. Calculate Mollycaits’ EBIT on the department store order.
c. If Molly renegotiates the contract at a price of $10.00 per figurine, what will the 
EBIT be?
d. If the store refuses to pay more than $8.00 per unit but is willing to negotiate 
quantity, what quantity of figurines will result in an EBIT of $4,000?
e. At this time, Mollycaits come in 15 different varieties. Whereas the average vari￾able cost per unit is $6.00, the actual cost varies from unit to unit. What recom￾mendation would you have for Molly and Caitlin with regard to pricing and the

procedures, and the financial data that the firm must have to make and imple￾ment dividend decisions.
mAnAgement to make appropriate dividend decisions for the firm, you need 
to understand types of dividends, arguments about the relevance of dividends, 
the factors that affect dividend policy, and types of dividend policies.
mArketing You need to understand factors affecting dividend policy because 
you may want to argue that the firm would be better off retaining funds for use in 
new marketing programs or products, rather than paying them out as dividends.

you may find that the firm’s dividend policy imposes limitations on planned ex￾pansion, replacement, or renewal projects.
In your personal life many individual investors buy common stock 
for the anticipated cash dividends. from a 
personal finance perspective, you should understand why and how firms pay 
dividends and the informational and financial implications of receiving them. 
Such understanding will help you select common stocks that have dividend-paying

I
n another sign of an improving economy, 
Whirlpool Corporation, the worldwide appli￾ance manufacturer, announced that it would in￾crease the quarterly dividend that it paid to its 
stockholders by 25 percent, up to 62.5 cents per 
share from 50 cents in the previous quarter. Whirl￾pool’s CEO, Jeff Fettig, explained, “Our actions 
have delivered a strong financial position en￾abling us to enhance returns to shareholders 
through a dividend increase. This dividend increase underscores our confidence that our long-term 
growth and innovation strategy will continue to create value for our shareholders.” Markets re￾acted to this news by increasing Whirlpool’s stock price by 3.2 percent.
Why does Whirlpool pay dividends? Fettig’s press release suggests two possibilities. One is 
that by paying dividends the company can “enhance returns” to shareholders. In other words, Whirl￾pool believes that returns to shareholders will be higher if the firm pays a dividend (and increases it) 
than if the firm does not pay a dividend. That sounds logical, but consider that when a firm pays a 
dividend, it is simply taking cash out of its bank account and putting that cash in the hands of share￾holders. Presumably, after a firm pays a dividend, its share price will reflect that it no longer holds as 
much cash as it did prior to the dividend payment. In other words, paying a dividend may simply 
be just switching money from one pocket (the company’s) to another (the shareholder’s).
Another reason that Whirlpool may pay a dividend is revealed in the second part of Fettig’s 
statement. Whirlpool increased its dividend to “underscore our confidence.” In other words, Whirl￾pool executives are telling the market that the firm’s financial position is strong enough and its pros￾pects bright enough that managers are confident that they can afford to increase the dividend by 
25 percent and still run the company effectively. Indeed, Whirlpool’s history suggests that managers 
use caution when increasing dividends. From 1995 to 2013, Whirlpool increased its dividend on 
just three occasions. Compare that record with the dividend history of Emerson Electric Co., a com￾pany that as of 2013 had increased its dividend for 54 consecutive years. Apparently Emerson and 
Whirlpool adopt different policies with respect to dividend increases.

 14.1 The Basics of Payout Policy
The term payout policy refers to the decisions that firms make about whether to 
distribute cash to shareholders, how much cash to distribute, and by what means 
the cash should be distributed. Although these decisions are probably less impor￾tant than the investment decisions covered in Chapters 10 through 12 and the 
financing choices discussed in Chapter 13, they are nonetheless decisions that 
managers and boards of directors face routinely. Investors monitor firms’ payout 
policies carefully, and unexpected changes in those policies can have significant 
effects on firms’ stock prices. The recent history of Whirlpool Corporation, 
briefly outlined in the chapter opener, demonstrates many of the important di￾mensions of payout policy.
ELEMENTS OF PAYOuT POLICY
Dividends are not the only means by which firms can distribute cash to share￾holders. Firms can also conduct share repurchases, in which they typically buy 
back some of their outstanding common stock through purchases in the open 
market. Whirlpool Corporation, like many other companies, uses both methods 
to put cash in the hands of their stockholders. In addition to increasing its divi￾dend payout, Whirlpool also resumed its share repurchase program in 2013, 
which had been halted during the economic recession. At the time of resuming 
the share repurchase program, the company’s free cash flow was between 
$600 million and $650 million and expected to increase to between $650 million 
and $700 million. Whirlpool’s chief executive officier, Jeff Fettig, stated that 
“sales increased in every region of the world” as the company continued to ex￾pand its margins and that as the company continued to execute its “long-term 
growth strategy . . . [it would] continue to drive actions to further create value for 
. . . shareholders.”
If we generalize the lessons about payout policy, we may expect the follow￾ing to be true:
 1. Rapidly growing firms generally do not pay out cash to shareholders.
 2. Slowing growth, positive cash flow generation, and favorable tax conditions 
can prompt firms to initiate cash payouts to investors. The ownership base of 
the company can also be an important factor in the decision to distribute 
cash.
 3. Cash payouts can be made through dividends or share repurchases. Many 
companies use both methods. In some years, more cash is paid out via divi￾dends, but sometimes share repurchases are larger than dividend payments.
 4. When business conditions are weak, firms are more willing to reduce share 
buybacks than to cut dividends.

Figure 14.1 illustrates both long-term trends and cyclical movements in earnings 
and dividends paid by large U.S. firms that are part of the Standard & Poor’s 500 
Stock Composite Index. The figure plots monthly earnings and dividend pay￾ments from 1950 through the first quarter of 2013. The top line represents the

per share. The vertical bars highlight ten periods during which the U.S. economy 
was in recession. Several important lessons can be gleaned from the figure. First, 
observe that over the long term the earnings and dividends lines tend to move 
together. Figure 14.1 uses a logarithmic scale, so the slope of each line represents 
the growth rate of earnings or dividends. Over the 60 years shown in the figure, 
the two lines tend to have about the same slope, meaning that earnings and divi￾dends grow at about the same rate when you take a long-term perspective. It 
makes perfect sense: Firms pay dividends out of earnings, so for dividends to 
grow over the long-term, earnings must grow too.
Second, the earnings series is much more volatile than the dividends series. 
That is, the line plotting earnings per share is quite bumpy, but the dividend line 
is much smoother, which suggests that firms do not adjust their dividend payments 
each time earnings move up or down. Instead, firms tend to smooth dividends, in￾creasing them slowly when earnings are growing rapidly and maintaining divi￾dend payments, rather than cutting them, when earnings decline.
To see this second point more clearly, look closely at the vertical bars in 
Figure 14.1. It is apparent that during recessions corporate earnings usually de￾cline, but dividends either do not decline at all or do not decline as sharply as earnings. 
In six of the last ten recessions, dividends were actually higher when the recession 
ended than just before it began, although the last two recessions are notable ex￾ceptions to this pattern. Note also that, just after the end of a recession, earnings 
typically increase quite rapidly. Dividends increase, too, but not as fast.
A third lesson from Figure 14.1 is that the effect of the recent recession on 
both corporate earnings and dividends was large by historical standards. An

enormous earnings decline occurred from 2007 to 2009. This decline forced firms 
to cut dividends more drastically than they had in years; nonetheless, the drop in 
dividends was slight compared with the earnings decrease.
TRENdS IN dIVIdENdS ANd ShARE REPuRChASES
When firms want to distribute cash to shareholders, they can either pay dividends 
or repurchase outstanding shares. Figure 14.2 plots aggregate dividends and share 
repurchases from 1971 through 2011 for all U.S. firms listed on U.S. stock ex￾changes (again, the figure uses a logarithmic vertical scale). A quick glance at the 
figure reveals that share repurchases played a relatively minor role in firms’ pay￾out practices in the 1970s. In 1971, for example, aggregate dividends totaled $21 
billion, but share repurchases that year were just $1.1 billion. In the 1980s, share 
repurchases began to grow rapidly and then slowed again in the early 1990s. The 
value of aggregate share repurchases first eclipsed total dividend payments in 
1998. That year, firms paid $175 billion in dividends, but they repurchased $185 
billion worth of stock. Share repurchases continued to outpace dividends for all 
but three of the next 13 years, peaking at $677 billion in 2007.
Whereas aggregate dividends rise smoothly over time, Figure 14.2 shows that 
share repurchases display much more volatility. The largest drops in repurchase 
activity occurred in 1974–1975, 1981, 1986, 1989–1991, 2000–2002, and 
2008–2010. All these drops correspond to periods when the U.S. economy was

When CBS announced 
in March 2007 that it 
would buy back $1.4 billion worth of 
stock, its sagging share price saw the 
biggest spike since the media giant 
parted ways with Viacom in 2005. The 
4.5 percent jump may have been an 
omen of good fortune—at the very 
least, it showed how much shareholders 
like buybacks.
Companies have been gobbling up 
their own shares faster than ever in a 
world of inexpensive capital and swol￾len balance sheets. Since 2003, the 
market for buybacks has boomed, with 
repurchases nearly on a par with capi￾tal expenditures. Some, however, have 
questioned the moves and motives that 
lead to a big buyback.
In addition to simply returning cash 
to shareholders, many companies also 
repurchase stock because they believe 
that their stock is undervalued. New 
research, however, shows that compa￾nies often use creative financial report￾ing to push earnings downward before 
buybacks, making the stock seem under￾valued and causing its price to bounce 
higher after the buyback. That pleases 
investors who then amplify the effect by 
pushing the price even higher.
“Managers who are acting opportu￾nistically can use their reporting discre￾tion to reduce the repurchase price by 
temporarily deflating earnings,” argue 
Guojin Gong, Henock Louis, and Amy 
Sun at Penn State University’s Smeal 
College of Business. Observing data 
from 1,720 companies, the authors say 
companies can easily create an appar￾ent slump by speeding up or slowing

classic methods of making the numbers 
look worse without actually breaking

The penalty for being caught 
deliberately managing earnings in 
advance of a buyback could be 
severe. With the variety of accounting 
scandals that popped up regularly in 
the early 2000s, executives would no 
doubt be wary of deflating earnings 
just to get a boost from a buyback. 
Still, that’s what Louis believes some 
are doing. “I don’t think what they’re 
doing is illegal,” he says. “But it’s mis￾leading their investors.”

How would you expect this ratio to behave during a recession? What

 14.2 The Mechanics of Payout Policy
At quarterly or semiannual meetings, a firm’s board of directors decides whether 
and in what amount to pay cash dividends. If the firm has already established a 
precedent of paying dividends, the decision facing the board is usually whether to 
maintain or increase the dividend, and that decision is based primarily on the 
firm’s recent performance and its ability to generate cash flow in the future. 
Boards rarely cut dividends unless they believe that the firm’s ability to generate 
cash is in serious jeopardy. Figure 14.3 plots the number of U.S. public industrial 
firms that increased, decreased, or maintained their dividend payment in each 
year from 1981 through 2011. Clearly, the number of firms increasing their divi￾dends is far greater than the number of companies cutting dividends in most 
years. When the economy is strong, as it was from 2003 to 2006, the ratio of in￾dustrial firms increasing dividends to those cutting dividends may be 10 to 1 or 
higher. However, a sign of the severity of the most recent recession was that in 
2009 this ratio was just 1.5 to 1. That year, 401 U.S. public industrial firms in￾creased their dividend, whereas 266 firms cut dividends.
Matter of fact
T
he growing importance of share repurchases in corporate payout policy is not confined to the 
United States. In most of the world’s largest economies, repurchases have been on the rise in 
recent years, eclipsing dividend payments at least some of the time in countries as diverse as Bel￾gium, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, Netherlands, South Korea, and Switzerland. 
A study of payout policy at firms from 25 different countries found that share repurchases rose at 
an annual rate of 19 percent from 1999 through 2008.

mired in or just emerging from a recession. During most of these periods, divi￾dends continued to grow modestly. Only during the recent, severe recession did 
both share repurchases and dividends fall.
Combining the lessons from Figures 14.1 and 14.2, we can draw three broad 
conclusions about firms’ payout policies. First, firms exhibit a strong desire to 
maintain modest, steady growth in dividends that is roughly consistent with the 
long-run growth in earnings. Second, share repurchases have accounted for a 
growing fraction of total cash payouts over time. Third, when earnings fluctuate, 
firms adjust their short-term payouts primarily by adjusting share repurchases 
(rather than dividends), cutting buybacks during recessions, and increasing them 
rapidly during economic expansions.ChAPTER 14   Payout Policy 619
Figure 14.3 clearly shows that firms prefer to increase rather than decrease 
dividends, but what is most evident is that firms prefer to maintain their estab￾lished dividend levels. In the average year, 79 percent of U.S. industrial firms elect 
to maintain their previous year’s dividend payout, and 96 percent avoid decreas￾ing their dividend. Although some firms will choose to grow their dividend pay￾out, the main goal of nearly all firms is to do whatever is necessary to avoid cut￾ting dividends.
CASh dIVIdENd PAYMENT PROCEduRES
When a firm’s directors declare a dividend, they issue a statement indicating the 
dividend amount and setting three important dates: the date of record, the ex￾dividend date, and the payment date. All persons whose names are recorded as 
stockholders on the date of record receive the dividend. These stockholders are 
often referred to as holders of record.
Because of the time needed to make bookkeeping entries when a stock is 
traded, the stock begins selling ex dividend 2 business days prior to the date of 
record. Purchasers of a stock selling ex dividend do not receive the current divi￾dend. A simple way to determine the first day on which the stock sells ex divi￾dend is to subtract 2 business days from the date of record.
The payment date is the actual date on which the firm mails the dividend 
payment to the holders of record. It is generally a few weeks after the record date. 
An example will clarify the various dates and the accounting effects.
On August 21, 2013, the board of directors of Best Buy announced that the firm’s 
next quarterly cash dividend would be $0.17 per share, payable on October 1, 
2013, to shareholders of record on Tuesday, September 10, 2013. Best Buy shares 
would begin trading ex dividend on the previous Friday, September 6. At the time

the dividend was declared, the key accounts of the firm were as follows (dollar

When the dividend was announced by the directors, almost $58 million of the

The mechanics of cash dividend payments are virtually the same for every divi￾dend paid by every public company. With share repurchases, firms can use at

firms simply buy back some of their outstanding shares on the open market. 
Firms have a great deal of latitude regarding when and how they execute these 
open-market purchases. Some firms make purchases in fixed amounts at regular 
intervals, whereas other firms try to behave more opportunistically, buying back 
more shares when they think that the share price is relatively low and fewer 
shares when they think that the price is high.
In contrast, firms sometimes repurchase shares through a self-tender offer or 
simply a tender offer. In a tender offer share repurchase, a firm announces the 
price it is willing to pay to buy back shares and the quantity of shares it wishes to 
repurchase. The tender offer price is usually set at a significant premium above 
the current market price. Shareholders who want to participate let the firm know 
how many shares they would like to sell back to the firm at the stated price. If 
shareholders do not offer to sell back as many shares as the firm wants to repur￾chase, the firm may either cancel or extend the offer. If the offer is oversub￾scribed, meaning that shareholders want to sell more shares than the firms wants 
to repurchase, the firm typically repurchases shares on a pro rata basis. For ex￾ample, if the firm wants to buy back 10 million shares, but 20 million shares are 
tendered by investors, the firm would repurchase exactly half of the shares ten￾dered by each shareholder.
A third method of buying back shares is called a Dutch auction share repur￾chase. In a Dutch auction, the firm specifies a range of prices at which it is will￾ing to repurchase shares and the quantity of shares that it desires. Investors can 
tender their shares to the firm at any price in the specified range, which allows 
the firm to trace out a demand curve for their stock. That is, the demand curve 
specifies how many shares investors will sell back to the firm at each price in the 
offer range. This analysis allows the firm to determine the minimum price required 
to repurchase the desired quantity of shares, and every shareholder receives that 
price.
In July 2013, Fidelity National Information Services announced a Dutch auction 
repurchase for 86 million common shares at prices ranging from $29 to $31.50 
per share. Fidelity shareholders were instructed to contact the company to indi￾cate how many shares they would be willing to sell at different prices in this 
range. Suppose that after accumulating this information from investors, Fidelity 
constructed the following demand schedule:

TAx TREATMENT OF dIVIdENdS ANd REPuRChASES
For many years, dividends and share repurchases had very different tax conse￾quences. The dividends that investors received were generally taxed at ordinary 
income tax rates. Therefore, if a firm paid $10 million in dividends, that payout 
would trigger significant tax liabilities for the firm’s shareholders (at least those 
subject to personal income taxes). On the other hand, when firms repurchased 
shares, the taxes triggered by that type of payout were generally much lower. 
There were several reasons for this difference. Only those shareholders who sold 
their shares as part of the repurchase program had any immediate tax liability. 
Shareholders who did not participate did not owe any taxes. Furthermore, some 
shareholders who did participate in the repurchase program might not owe any 
taxes on the funds they received if they were tax-exempt institutions or if they 
sold their shares at a loss. Finally, even those shareholders who participated in 
the repurchase program and sold their shares for a profit paid taxes only at the 
(usually lower) capital gains tax rate, (assuming the shares were held for at least 
one year), and even that tax only applied to the gain, not to the entire value of the 
shares repurchased. Consequently, investors could generally expect to pay far less 
in taxes on money that a firm distributed through a share repurchase compared 
to money paid out as dividends. That differential tax treatment in part explains 
the growing popularity of share repurchase programs in the 1980s and 1990s.
The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 significantly 
changed the tax treatment of corporate dividends for most taxpayers. Prior to 
passage of the 2003 law, dividends received by investors were taxed as ordinary 
income at rates as high as 35 percent. The 2003 act reduced the tax rate on cor￾porate dividends for most taxpayers to the tax rate applicable to capital gains, 
which is a maximum rate of 5 percent to 15 percent, depending on the taxpayer’s 
tax bracket. This change significantly diminishes the degree of “double taxation” 
of dividends, which results when the corporation is first taxed on its income and 
then shareholders pay taxes on the dividends that they receive. After-tax cash 
flow to dividend recipients is much greater at the lower applicable tax rate; the 
result is noticeably higher dividend payouts by corporations today than prior to 
passage of the 2003 legislation.
In early 2012, Congress passed the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. 
For eveyone except those individuals in the newly established highest tax bracket, 
dividends and capital gains continue to be taxed at 15 percent. (For more details 
on the impact of the 2012 act, see the Focus on Practice box.)
The board of directors of Espinoza Industries, Inc., on October 4 
of the current year, declared a quarterly dividend of $0.46 per 
share payable to all holders of record on Friday, October 30, with a payment 
date of November 19. Rob and Kate Heckman, who purchased 500 shares of 
Espinoza’s common stock on Thursday, October 15, wish to determine whether 
they will receive the recently declared dividend and, if so, when and how much 
they would net after taxes from the dividend given that the dividends would be 
subject to a 15% federal income tax.
Personal Finance Example 14.3 ▶
MyFinancelab Solution

Given the Friday, October 30, date of record, the stock would begin selling 
ex dividend 2 business days earlier on Wednesday, October 28. Purchasers of the 
stock on or before Tuesday, October 27, would receive the right to the dividend. 
Because the Heckmans purchased the stock on October 15, they would be eligible 
to receive the dividend of $0.46 per share. Thus, the Heckmans will receive $230 
in dividends ($0.46 per share * 500 shares), which will be mailed to them on the 
November 19 payment date. Because they are subject to a 15% federal income 
tax on the dividends, the Heckmans will net $195.50 [(1 - 0.15) * $230] after 
taxes from the Espinoza Industries dividend.

to that new law, dividends were taxed 
once as part of corporate earnings and 
again as the personal income of the 
investor, in both cases with a potential 
top rate of 35 percent. The result was 
an effective tax rate of 57.75 percent 
on some dividends. Although the 2003 
tax law did not completely eliminate the 
double taxation of dividends, it reduced 
the maximum possible effect of the dou￾ble taxation of dividends to 44.75 per￾cent. For taxpayers in the lower tax 
brackets, the combined effect was a 
maximum of 38.25 percent. Both the 
number of companies paying dividends 
and the amount of dividends spiked fol￾lowing the lowering of tax rates on 
dividends. For example, total dividends

In early 2012, Congress passed

continue to be taxed at 15 percent. 
However, for individuals with more than

initiating dividends rose by nearly 40

The tax rates under JGTRRA were 
originally programmed to expire at the 
end of 2008. However, in May 2006, 
Congress passed the Tax Increase Pre￾vention and Reconciliation Act of 2005
(TIPRA), extending the beneficial tax rates 
for 2 more years. Taxpayers in tax brack￾ets above 15 percent paid a 15 percent 
rate on dividends paid before Decem￾ber 31, 2008. For taxpayers with a mar￾ginal tax rate of 15 percent or lower, the 
dividend tax rate was 5 percent until 
December 31, 2007, and 0 percent from 
2008 to 2010. Long-term capital gains 
tax rates were reduced to the same rates 
as the new dividend tax rates through 
2010. Although JGTRRA expired at the 
end of 2010, Congress extended the 
law until 2012 by passing the Tax Re￾lief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthori￾zation, and Job Creation Act of 2010.

even allow investors to make their initial purchases of the firm’s stock directly 
from the company without going through a broker. With DRIPs, plan partici￾pants typically can acquire shares at about 5 percent below the prevailing market 
price. From its point of view, the firm can issue new shares to participants more 
economically, avoiding the underpricing and flotation costs that would accom￾pany the public sale of new shares. Clearly, the existence of a DRIP may enhance 
the market appeal of a firm’s shares.
STOCK PRICE REACTIONS TO CORPORATE PAYOuTS
What happens to the stock price when a firm pays a dividend or repurchases 
shares? In theory, the answers to those questions are straightforward. Take a 
dividend payment for example. Suppose that a firm has $1 billion in assets, fi￾nanced entirely by 10 million shares of common stock. Each share should be 
worth $100 ($1 billion , 10,000,000 shares). Now suppose that the firm pays a 
$1 per share cash dividend, for a total dividend payout of $10 million. The assets 
of the firm fall to $990 million. Because shares outstanding remain at 10 million, 
each share should be worth $99. In other words, the stock price should fall by $1, 
exactly the amount of the dividend. The reduced share price simply reflects that 
cash formerly held by the firm is now in the hands of investors. To be precise, this 
reduction in share price should occur not when the dividend checks are mailed 
but rather when the stock begins trading ex dividend.
For share repurchases, the intuition is that “you get what you pay for.” In 
other words, if the firm buys back shares at the going market price, the reduction 
in cash is exactly offset by the reduction in the number of shares outstanding, so 
the market price of the stock should remain the same. Once again, consider the 
firm with $1 billion in assets and 10 million shares outstanding worth $100 each. 
Let’s say that the firm decides to distribute $10 million in cash by repurchasing 
100,000 shares of stock. After the repurchase is completed, the firm’s assets will 
fall by $10 million to $990 million, but the shares outstanding will fall by 100,000 
to 9,900,000. The new share price is therefore $990,000,000 , 9,900,000, or 
$100, as before.
In practice, taxes and a variety of other market imperfections may cause 
the actual change in share price in response to a dividend payment or share 
repurchase to deviate from what we expect in theory. Furthermore, the stock 
price reaction to a cash payout may be different than the reaction to an an￾nouncement about an upcoming payout. For example, when a firm announces 
that it will increase its dividend, the share price usually rises on that news, 
even though the share price will fall when the dividend is actually paid. The 
next section discusses the impact of payout policy on the value of the firm in 
greater depth.

 14.3 Relevance of Payout Policy
The financial literature has reported numerous theories and empirical findings 
concerning payout policy. Although this research provides some interesting in￾sights about payout policy, capital budgeting and capital structure decisions are 
generally considered far more important than payout decisions. In other words, 
firms should not sacrifice good investment and financing decisions for a payout 
policy of questionable importance.
The most important question about payout policy is this one: Does payout 
policy have a significant effect on the value of a firm? A number of theoretical 
and empirical answers to this question have been proposed, but as yet there is no 
widely accepted rule to help a firm find its “optimal” payout policy. Most of the 
theories that have been proposed to explain the consequences of payout policy 
have focused on dividends. From here on, we will use the terms dividend policy
and payout policy interchangeably, meaning that we make no distinction between 
dividend payouts and share repurchases in terms of the theories that try to ex￾plain whether these policies have an effect on firm value.
RESIduAL ThEORY OF dIVIdENdS
The residual theory of dividends is a school of thought that suggests that the divi￾dend paid by a firm should be viewed as a residual, that is, the amount left over 
after all acceptable investment opportunities have been undertaken. Using this ap￾proach, the firm would treat the dividend decision in three steps as follows:
Step 1 Determine its optimal level of capital expenditures, which would be the 
level that exploits all a firm’s positive NPV projects.
Step 2 Using the optimal capital structure proportions (see Chapter 13), esti￾mate the total amount of equity financing needed to support the expen￾ditures generated in Step 1.
Step 3 Because the cost of retained earnings, rr
, is less than the cost of new com￾mon stock, rn
, use retained earnings to meet the equity requirement de￾termined in Step 2. If retained earnings are inadequate to meet this need, 
sell new common stock. If the available retained earnings are in excess of 
this need, distribute the surplus amount—the residual—as dividends.
According to this approach, as long as the firm’s equity need exceeds the amount 
of retained earnings, no cash dividend is paid. The argument for this approach is 
that it is sound management to be certain that the company has the money it 
needs to compete effectively. This view of dividends suggests that the required 
return of investors, rs
, is not influenced by the firm’s dividend policy, a premise 
that in turn implies that dividend policy is irrelevant in the sense that it does not 
affect firm value.
ThE dIVIdENd IRRELEVANCE ThEORY
The residual theory of dividends implies that if the firm cannot invest its earnings 
to earn a return that exceeds the cost of capital, it should distribute the earnings 
by paying dividends to stockholders. This approach suggests that dividends rep￾resent an earnings residual rather than an active decision variable that affects the

firm’s value. Such a view is consistent with the dividend irrelevance theory put 
forth by Merton H. Miller and Franco Modigliani (M and M).2
 They argue that 
the firm’s value is determined solely by the earning power and risk of its assets 
(investments) and that the manner in which it splits its earnings stream between 
dividends and internally retained (and reinvested) funds does not affect this value. 
M and M’s theory suggests that in a perfect world (certainty, no taxes, no trans￾actions costs, and no other market imperfections), the value of the firm is unaf￾fected by the distribution of dividends.
Of course, real markets do not satisfy the “perfect markets” assumptions of 
Modigliani and Miller’s original theory. One market imperfection that may be 
important is taxation. Historically, dividends have usually been taxed at higher 
rates than capital gains. A firm that pays out its earnings as dividends may trigger 
higher tax liabilities for its investors than a firm that retains earnings. As a firm 
retains earnings, its share price should rise, and investors enjoy capital gains. In￾vestors can defer paying taxes on these gains indefinitely simply by not selling 
their shares. Even if they do sell their shares, they may pay a relatively low tax rate 
on the capital gains. In contrast, when a firm pays dividends, investors receive 
cash immediately and pay taxes at the rates dictated by then-current tax laws.
Even though this discussion makes it seem that retaining profits rather than 
paying them out as dividends may be better for shareholders on an after-tax ba￾sis, Modigliani and Miller argue that this assumption may not be the case. They 
observe that not all investors are subject to income taxation. Some institutional 
investors, such as pension funds, do not pay taxes on the dividends and capital 
gains that they earn. For these investors, the payout policies of different firms 
have no impact on the taxes that investors have to pay. Therefore, Modigliani 
and Miller argue, there can be a clientele effect in which different types of inves￾tors are attracted to firms with different payout policies due to tax effects. Tax￾exempt investors may invest more heavily in firms that pay dividends because 
they are not affected by the typically higher tax rates on dividends. Investors who 
would have to pay higher taxes on dividends may prefer to invest in firms that 
retain more earnings rather than paying dividends. If a firm changes its payout 
policy, the value of the firm will not change; instead, what will change is the type 
of investor who holds the firm’s shares. According to this argument, tax clienteles 
mean that payout policies cannot affect firm value, but they can affect the owner￾ship base of the company.
In summary, M and M and other proponents of dividend irrelevance argue 
that, all else being equal, an investor’s required return—and therefore the value 
of the firm—is unaffected by dividend policy. In other words, there is no “opti￾mal” dividend policy for a particular firm.
ARGuMENTS FOR dIVIdENd RELEVANCE
Modigliani and Miller’s assertion that dividend policy was irrelevant was a radical 
idea when it was first proposed. The prevailing wisdom at the time was that payout 
policy could improve the value of the firm and therefore was relevant. The key ar￾gument in support of dividend relevance theory is attributed to Myron J. Gordon

and John Lintner,3
 who suggest that there is, in fact, a direct relationship between 
the firm’s dividend policy and its market value. Fundamental to this proposition is 
their bird-in-the-hand argument, which suggests that investors see current divi￾dends as less risky than future dividends or capital gains: “A bird in the hand is 
worth two in the bush.” Gordon and Lintner argue that current dividend payments 
reduce investor uncertainty, causing investors to discount the firm’s earnings at a 
lower rate and, all else being equal, to place a higher value on the firm’s stock. 
Conversely, if dividends are reduced or are not paid, investor uncertainty will in￾crease, raising the required return and lowering the stock’s value.
Modigliani and Miller argued that the bird-in-the-hand theory was a fallacy. 
They said that investors who want immediate cash flow from a firm that did not 
pay dividends could simply sell off a portion of their shares. Remember that the 
stock price of a firm that retains earnings should rise over time as cash builds up 
inside the firm. By selling a few shares every quarter or every year, investors could, 
according to Modigliani and Miller, replicate the same cash flow stream that they 
would have received if the firm had paid dividends rather than retaining earnings.
Studies have shown that large changes in dividends do affect share price. In￾creases in dividends result in increased share price, and decreases in dividends 
result in decreased share price. One interpretation of this evidence is that it is not 
the dividends per se that matter but rather the informational content of dividends 
with respect to future earnings. In other words, investors view a change in divi￾dends, up or down, as a signal that management expects future earnings to 
change in the same direction. Investors view an increase in dividends as a positive 
signal, and they bid up the share price. They view a decrease in dividends as a 
negative signal that causes investors to sell their shares, resulting in the share 
price decreasing.
Another argument in support of the idea that dividends can affect the value 
of the firm is the agency cost theory. Recall that agency costs are costs that arise 
due to the separation between the firm’s owners and its managers. Managers 
sometimes have different interests than owners. Managers may want to retain 
earnings simply to increase the size of the firm’s asset base. There is greater pres￾tige and perhaps higher compensation associated with running a larger firm. 
Shareholders are aware of the temptations that managers face, and they worry 
that retained earnings may not be invested wisely. The agency cost theory says 
that a firm that commits to paying dividends is reassuring shareholders that man￾agers will not waste their money. Given this reassurance, investors will pay higher 
prices for firms that promise regular dividend payments.
Although many other arguments related to dividend relevance have been put 
forward, empirical studies have not provided evidence that conclusively settles 
the debate about whether and how payout policy affects firm value. As we have 
already said, even if dividend policy really matters, it is almost certainly less im￾portant than other decisions that financial mangers make, such as the decision to 
invest in a large new project or the decision about what combination of debt and 
equity the firm should use to finance its operations. Still, most financial managers 
today, especially those running large corporations, believe that payout policy can 
affect the value of the firm.

 14.4 Factors Affecting dividend Policy
The firm’s dividend policy represents a plan of action to be followed whenever it 
makes a dividend decision. Firms develop policies consistent with their goals. 
Before we review some of the popular types of dividend policies, we discuss five 
factors that firms consider in establishing a dividend policy. They are legal con￾straints, contractual constraints, the firm’s growth prospects, owner consider￾ations, and market considerations.
LEGAL CONSTRAINTS
Most states prohibit corporations from paying out as cash dividends any portion of 
the firm’s “legal capital,” which is typically measured by the par value of common 
stock. Other states define legal capital to include not only the par value of the com￾mon stock but also any paid-in capital in excess of par. These capital impairment 
restrictions are generally established to provide a sufficient equity base to protect 
creditors’ claims. An example will clarify the differing definitions of capital.
The stockholders’ equity account of Miller Flour Company, a large grain proces￾sor, is presented in the following table.
Example 14.4 ▶
LG 3
dividend policy
The firm’s plan of action to be 
followed whenever it makes a 
dividend decision.
Miller Flour Company 
Stockholders’ Equity
Common stock at par $100,000
Paid-in capital in excess of par 200,000
Retained earnings 140,000
 Total stockholders’ equity $440,000
In states where the firm’s legal capital is defined as the par value of its common 
stock, the firm could pay out $340,000 ($200,000 + $140,000) in cash divi￾dends without impairing its capital. In states where the firm’s legal capital in￾cludes all paid-in capital, the firm could pay out only $140,000 in cash dividends.
Firms sometimes impose an earnings requirement limiting the amount of div￾idends. With this restriction, the firm cannot pay more in cash dividends than the 
sum of its most recent and past retained earnings. However, the firm is not pro￾hibited from paying more in dividends than its current earnings.4
4. A firm that has an operating loss in the current period can still pay cash dividends as long as sufficient retained 
earnings against which to charge the dividend are available and, of course, as long as it has the cash with which to 
make the payments.ChAPTER 14   Payout Policy 629
Assume that Miller Flour Company, from the preceding example, in the year just 
ended has $30,000 in earnings available for common stock dividends. As the ta￾ble in Example 14.4 indicates, the firm has past retained earnings of $140,000. 
Thus, it can legally pay dividends of up to $170,000.
If a firm has overdue liabilities or is legally insolvent or bankrupt, most states 
prohibit its payment of cash dividends. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service pro￾hibits firms from accumulating earnings to reduce the owners’ taxes. If the IRS can 
determine that a firm has accumulated an excess of earnings to allow owners to delay 
paying ordinary income taxes on dividends received, it may levy an excess earnings 
accumulation tax on any retained earnings above $250,000 for most businesses.
During the recent financial crisis, a number of financial institutions received 
federal financial assistance. Those firms had to agree to restrictions on dividend 
payments to shareholders until they repaid the money that they received from the 
government. Bank of America, for example, had more than 30 years of consecu￾tive dividend increases before accepting federal bailout money. As part of its bail￾out, Bank of America had to cut dividends to $0.01 per share.
CONTRACTuAL CONSTRAINTS
Often, the firm’s ability to pay cash dividends is constrained by restrictive provi￾sions in a loan agreement. Generally, these constraints prohibit the payment of 
cash dividends until the firm achieves a certain level of earnings, or they may 
limit dividends to a certain dollar amount or percentage of earnings. Constraints 
on dividends help to protect creditors from losses due to the firm’s insolvency.
GROWTh PROSPECTS
The firm’s financial requirements are directly related to how much it expects to 
grow and what assets it will need to acquire. It must evaluate its profitability and 
risk to develop insight into its ability to raise capital externally. In addition, the 
firm must determine the cost and speed with which it can obtain financing. Gener￾ally, a large, mature firm has adequate access to new capital, whereas a rapidly 
growing firm may not have sufficient funds available to support its acceptable 
projects. A growth firm is likely to have to depend heavily on internal financing 
through retained earnings, so it is likely to pay out only a very small percentage of 
its earnings as dividends. A more established firm is in a better position to pay out 
a large proportion of its earnings, particularly if it has ready sources of financing.
OWNER CONSIdERATIONS
The firm must establish a policy that has a favorable effect on the wealth of the 
majority of owners. One consideration is the tax status of a firm’s owners. If a 
firm has a large percentage of wealthy stockholders who have sizable incomes, it 
may decide to pay out a lower percentage of its earnings to allow the owners to 
delay the payment of taxes until they sell the stock. Because cash dividends are 
taxed at the same rate as capital gains (as a result of the 2003 and 2012 Tax 
Acts), this strategy benefits owners through the tax deferral rather than as a result 
of a lower tax rate. Lower-income shareholders, however, who need dividend 
income, will prefer a higher payout of earnings.
Example 14.5 ▶
excess earnings 
accumulation tax
The tax the IRS levies on 
retained earnings above 
$250,000 for most businesses 
when it determines that the firm 
has accumulated an excess of 
earnings to allow owners to 
delay paying ordinary income 
taxes on dividends received.630 PART 6   Long-Term Financial Decisions
A second consideration is the owners’ investment opportunities. A firm 
should not retain funds for investment in projects yielding lower returns than the 
owners could obtain from external investments of equal risk. If it appears that the 
owners have better opportunities externally, the firm should pay out a higher 
percentage of its earnings. If the firm’s investment opportunities are at least as 
good as similar-risk external investments, a lower payout is justifiable.
A final consideration is the potential dilution of ownership. If a firm pays out 
a high percentage of earnings, new equity capital will have to be raised with com￾mon stock. The result of a new stock issue may be dilution of both control and 
earnings for the existing owners. By paying out a low percentage of its earnings, 
the firm can minimize the possibility of such dilution.
MARKET CONSIdERATIONS
One of the more recent theories proposed to explain firms’ payout decisions is 
called the catering theory. According to the catering theory, investors’ demands 
for dividends fluctuate over time. For example, during an economic boom ac￾companied by a rising stock market, investors may be more attracted to stocks 
that offer prospects of large capital gains. When the economy is in recession and 
the stock market is falling, investors may prefer the security of a dividend. The 
catering theory suggests that firms are more likely to initiate dividend payments 
or to increase existing payouts when investors exhibit a strong preference for 
dividends. Firms cater to the preferences of investors.

14–9 What five factors do firms consider in establishing dividend policy? 
Briefly describe each of them.
 
 14.5 Types of dividend Policies
The firm’s dividend policy must be formulated with two objectives in mind: pro￾viding for sufficient financing and maximizing the wealth of the firm’s owners. 
Three different dividend policies are described in the following sections. A par￾ticular firm’s cash dividend policy may incorporate elements of each.
CONSTANT-PAYOuT-RATIO dIVIdENd POLICY
One type of dividend policy involves use of a constant payout ratio. The dividend 
payout ratio indicates the percentage of each dollar earned that the firm distrib￾utes to the owners in the form of cash. It is calculated by dividing the firm’s 
cash dividend per share by its earnings per share. With a constant-payout-ratio 
dividend policy, the firm establishes that a certain percentage of earnings is paid 
to owners in each dividend period.
The problem with this policy is that if the firm’s earnings drop or if a loss 
occurs in a given period, the dividends may be low or even nonexistent. Because 
dividends are often considered an indicator of the firm’s future condition and 
status, the firm’s stock price may be adversely affected.

Peachtree Industries, a miner of potassium, has a policy of paying out 40% of 
earnings in cash dividends. In periods when a loss occurs, the firm’s policy is to 
pay no cash dividends. Data on Peachtree’s earnings, dividends, and average 
stock prices for the past 6 years follow.
Example 14.6 ▶
Year Earnings/share Dividends/share Average price/share
2015 -$0.50 $0.00 $42.00

2012 -1.50 0.00 38.00
2011 2.00 0.80 46.00
2010 4.50 1.80 50.00
Dividends increased in 2013 and in 2014 but decreased in the other years. In 
years of decreasing dividends, the firm’s stock price dropped; when dividends in￾creased, the price of the stock increased. Peachtree’s sporadic dividend payments 
appear to make its owners uncertain about the returns they can expect.
REGuLAR dIVIdENd POLICY
The regular dividend policy is based on the payment of a fixed-dollar dividend in 
each period. Often, firms that use this policy increase the regular dividend once a 
sustainable increase in earnings has occurred. Under this policy, dividends are 
almost never decreased.
The dividend policy of Woodward Laboratories, a producer of a popular artificial 
sweetener, is to pay annual dividends of $1.00 per share until per-share earnings have 
exceeded $4.00 for 3 consecutive years. At that point, the annual dividend is raised to 
$1.50 per share, and a new earnings plateau is established. The firm does not antici￾pate decreasing its dividend unless its liquidity is in jeopardy. Data for Woodward’s 
earnings, dividends, and average stock prices for the past 12 years follow.

Whatever the level of earnings, Woodward Laboratories paid dividends of 
$1.00 per share through 2012. In 2013, the dividend increased to $1.50 per 
share because earnings in excess of $4.00 per share had been achieved for 
3 years. In 2013, the firm also had to establish a new earnings plateau for fur￾ther dividend increases. Woodward Laboratories’ average price per share ex￾hibited a stable, increasing behavior in spite of a somewhat volatile pattern of 
earnings.
Often, a regular dividend policy is built around a target dividend-payout ratio.
Under this policy, the firm attempts to pay out a certain percentage of earnings, 
but rather than let dividends fluctuate, it pays a stated dollar dividend and ad￾justs that dividend toward the target payout as proven earnings increases occur. 
For instance, Woodward Laboratories appears to have a target payout ratio of 
around 35 percent. The payout was about 35 percent ($1.00 , $2.85) when the 
dividend policy was set in 2004, and when the dividend was raised to $1.50 in 
2013, the payout ratio was about 33 percent ($1.50 , $4.60).
LOW-REGuLAR-ANd-ExTRA dIVIdENd POLICY
Some firms establish a low-regular-and-extra dividend policy, paying a low regu￾lar dividend, supplemented by an additional (“extra”) dividend when earnings 
are higher than normal in a given period. By calling the additional dividend an 
extra dividend, the firm avoids setting expectations that the dividend increase 
will be permanent. This policy is especially common among companies that expe￾rience cyclical shifts in earnings.
By establishing a low regular dividend that is paid each period, the firm 
gives investors the stable income necessary to build confidence in the firm, 
and the extra dividend permits them to share in the earnings from an espe￾cially good period. Firms using this policy must raise the level of the regular 
dividend once proven increases in earnings have been achieved. The extra 
dividend should not be a regular event; otherwise, it becomes meaningless. 
The use of a target dividend-payout ratio in establishing the regular dividend 
level is advisable.

STOCK dIVIdENdS
A stock dividend is the payment, to existing owners, of a dividend in the form of 
stock. Often firms pay stock dividends as a replacement for or a supplement to 
cash dividends. In a stock dividend, investors simply receive additional shares in 
proportion to the shares they already own. No cash is distributed, and no real 
value is transferred from the firm to investors. Instead, because the number of 
outstanding shares increases, the stock price declines roughly in line with the 
amount of the stock dividend.
Accounting Aspects
In an accounting sense, the payment of a stock dividend is a shifting of funds be￾tween stockholders’ equity accounts rather than an outflow of funds. When a firm 
declares a stock dividend, the procedures for announcement and distribution are 
the same as those described earlier for a cash dividend. The accounting entries as￾sociated with the payment of a stock dividend vary depending on its size. A small 
(ordinary) stock dividend is a stock dividend that represents less than 20 percent 
to 25 percent of the common stock outstanding when the dividend is declared. 
Small stock dividends are most common.
The current stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet of Garrison Corporation, 
a distributor of prefabricated cabinets, is as shown in the following accounts.

Garrison, which has 100,000 shares of common stock outstanding, declares 
a 10% stock dividend when the market price of its stock is $15 per share. Be￾cause 10,000 new shares (10% of 100,000) are issued at the prevailing market 
price of $15 per share, $150,000 ($15 per share * 10,000 shares) is shifted from 
retained earnings to the common stock and paid-in capital accounts. A total of 
$40,000 ($4 par * 10,000 shares) is added to common stock, and the remaining 
$110,000 [($15 - $4) * 10,000 shares] is added to the paid-in capital in excess 
of par. The resulting account balances are as follows:
Preferred stock $ 300,000
Common stock (110,000 shares at $4 par) 440,000
Paid-in capital in excess of par 710,000
Retained earnings 550,000
 Total stockholders’ equity $2,000,000
The firm’s total stockholders’ equity has not changed; funds have merely been 
shifted among stockholders’ equity accounts.634 PART 6   Long-Term Financial Decisions
Shareholder’s Viewpoint
The shareholder receiving a stock dividend typically receives nothing of value. Af￾ter the dividend is paid, the per-share value of the shareholder’s stock decreases in 
proportion to the dividend in such a way that the market value of his or her total 
holdings in the firm remains unchanged. Therefore, stock dividends are usually 
nontaxable. The shareholder’s proportion of ownership in the firm also remains 
the same, and as long as the firm’s earnings remain unchanged, so does his or her 
share of total earnings. (However, if the firm’s earnings and cash dividends increase 
when the stock dividend is issued, an increase in share value is likely to result.)
Ms. X owned 10,000 shares of Garrison Corporation’s stock. The company’s 
most recent earnings were $220,000, and earnings are not expected to change in 
the near future. Before the stock dividend, Ms. X owned 10% (10,000 shares ,
100,000 shares) of the firm’s stock, which was selling for $15 per share. Earnings 
per share were $2.20 ($220,000 , 100,000 shares). Because Ms. X owned 
10,000 shares, her earnings were $22,000 ($2.20 per share * 10,000 shares). 
After receiving the 10% stock dividend, Ms. X has 11,000 shares, which again is 
10% of the ownership (11,000 shares , 110,000 shares). The market price of 
the stock can be expected to drop to $13.64 per share [$15 * (1.00 , 1.10)], 
which means that the market value of Ms. X’s holdings is $150,000 (11,000 
shares * $13.64 per share). This is the same as the initial value of her holdings 
(10,000 shares * $15 per share). The future earnings per share drops to $2 
($220,000 , 110,000 shares) because the same $220,000 in earnings must now 
be divided among 110,000 shares. Because Ms. X still owns 10% of the stock, 
her share of total earnings is still $22,000 ($2 per share * 11,000 shares).
In summary, if the firm’s earnings remain constant and total cash dividends 
do not increase, a stock dividend results in a lower per-share market value for the 
firm’s stock.
The Company’s Viewpoint
Stock dividends are more costly to issue than cash dividends, but certain advan￾tages may outweigh these costs. Firms find the stock dividend to be a way to give 
owners something without having to use cash. Generally, when a firm needs to 
preserve cash to finance rapid growth, it uses a stock dividend. When the stock￾holders recognize that the firm is reinvesting the cash flow so as to maximize fu￾ture earnings, the market value of the firm should at least remain unchanged. 
However, if the stock dividend is paid so as to retain cash to satisfy past-due bills, 
a decline in market value may result.
STOCK SPLITS
Although not a type of dividend, stock splits have an effect on a firm’s share price 
similar to that of stock dividends. A stock split is a method commonly used to 
lower the market price of a firm’s stock by increasing the number of shares be￾longing to each shareholder. In a 2-for-1 split, for example, two new shares are 
exchanged for each old share, with each new share being worth half the value of 
each old share. A stock split has no effect on the firm’s capital structure and is 
usually nontaxable.

Quite often, a firm believes that its stock is priced too high and that lowering 
the market price will enhance trading activity. Stock splits are often made prior to 
issuing additional stock to enhance that stock’s marketability and stimulate mar￾ket activity. It is not unusual for a stock split to cause a slight increase in the 
market value of the stock, attributable to its informational content and because 
total dividends paid commonly increase slightly after a split.5
Delphi Company, a forest products concern, had 200,000 shares of $2-par-value 
common stock and no preferred stock outstanding. Because the stock is selling at 
a high market price, the firm has declared a 2-for-1 stock split. The total before￾and after-split stockholders’ equity is shown in the following table.
Example 14.10 ▶
5. Eugene F. Fama, Lawrence Fisher, Michael C. Jensen, and Richard Roll, “The Adjustment of Stock Prices to New 
Information,” International Economic Review 10 (February 1969), pp. 1–21, found that the stock price increases 
before the split announcement and that the increase in stock price is maintained if dividends per share are increased 
but is lost if dividends per share are not increased, following the split.

Retained earnings 2,000,000 Retained earnings 2,000,000
 Total stockholders’ equity $6,400,000 Total stockholders’ equity $6,400,000
The insignificant effect of the stock split on the firm’s books is obvious.
Stock can be split in any way desired. Sometimes a reverse stock split is made: 
The firm exchanges a certain number of outstanding shares for one new share. For 
example, in a 1-for-3 split, one new share is exchanged for three old shares. In a re￾verse stock split, the firm’s stock price rises due to the reduction in shares outstand￾ing. Firms may conduct a reverse split if their stock price is getting so low that the 
exchange where the stock trades threatens to delist the stock. For example, the New 
York Stock Exchange requires that the average closing price of a listed security must 
be no less than $1 over any consecutive 30-day trading period. In June 2010, the 
video chain Blockbuster asked shareholders to approve a reverse stock split to pre￾vent the NYSE from delisting Blockbuster’s stock. Shareholders didn’t approve the 
measure, and the NYSE delisted Blockbuster stock the following month.
Shakira Washington, a single investor in the 25% federal in￾come tax bracket, owns 260 shares of Advanced Technology, 
Inc., common stock. She originally bought the stock 2 years ago at its initial pub￾lic offering (IPO) price of $9 per share. The stock of this fast-growing technology 
company is currently trading for $60 per share, so the current value of her Advanced 
Technology stock is $15,600 (260 shares * $60 per share). Because the firm’s 
board believes that the stock would trade more actively in the $20 to $30 price 
range, it just announced a 3-for-1 stock split. Shakira wishes to determine the 
impact of the stock split on her holdings and taxes.

Because the stock will split 3 for 1, after the split Shakira will own 780 shares 
(3 * 260 shares). She should expect the market price of the stock to drop to $20 
(1/3 * $60) immediately after the split; the value of her after-split holding will be 
$15,600 (780 shares * $20 per share). Because the $15,600 value of her after￾split holdings in Advanced Technology stock exactly equals the before-split value 
of $15,600, Shakira has experienced neither a gain nor a loss on the stock as a 
result of the 3-for-1 split. Even if there were a gain or loss attributable to the split, 
Shakira would not have any tax liability unless she actually sold the stock and 
realized that (or any other) gain or loss.

Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
Payout policy refers to the cash flows that a firm distributes to its common 
stockholders. A share of common stock gives its owner the right to receive all 
future dividends. The present value of all those future dividends expected over a 
firm’s assumed infinite life determines the firm’s stock value.
Corporate payouts not only represent cash flows to shareholders but also 
contain useful information about the firm’s current and future performance. 
Such information affects the shareholders’ perception of the firm’s risk. A firm 
can also pay stock dividends, initiate stock splits, or repurchase stock. All these 
dividend-related actions can affect the firm’s risk, return, and value as a result of 
their cash flows and informational content.
Although the theory of relevance of dividends is still evolving, the behavior 
of most firms and stockholders suggests that dividend policy affects share prices. 
Therefore, financial managers try to develop and implement dividend policy that 
is consistent with the firm’s goal of maximizing stock price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
LG 1 Understand cash payout procedures, their tax treatment, and the role of 
dividend reinvestment plans. The board of directors makes the cash payout de￾cision and, for dividends, establishes the record and payment dates. As a result 
of tax-law changes in 2003 and 2012, most taxpayers pay taxes on corporate 
dividends at a maximum rate of 5 percent to 15 percent, depending on the tax￾payer’s tax bracket. Some firms offer dividend reinvestment plans that allow 
stockholders to acquire shares in lieu of cash dividends.ChAPTER 14   Payout Policy 637
LG 2 Describe the residual theory of dividends and the key arguments with re￾gard to dividend irrelevance and relevance. The residual theory suggests that 
dividends should be viewed as the earnings left after all acceptable investment 
opportunities have been undertaken. Miller and Modigliani argue in favor of 
dividend irrelevance, using a perfect world in which market imperfections such 
as transaction costs and taxes do not exist. Gordon and Lintner advance the 
theory of dividend relevance, basing their argument on the uncertainty-reducing 
effect of dividends, supported by their bird-in-the-hand argument. Empirical 
studies fail to provide clear support of dividend relevance. Even so, the actions 
of financial managers and stockholders tend to support the belief that dividend 
policy does affect stock value.
LG 3 Discuss the key factors involved in establishing a dividend policy. A firm’s 
dividend policy should provide for sufficient financing and maximize stockhold￾ers’ wealth. Dividend policy is affected by legal and contractual constraints, by 
growth prospects, and by owner and market considerations. Legal constraints 
prohibit corporations from paying out as cash dividends any portion of the 
firm’s “legal capital,” nor can firms with overdue liabilities and legally insolvent 
or bankrupt firms pay cash dividends. Contractual constraints result from re￾strictive provisions in the firm’s loan agreements. Growth prospects affect the 
relative importance of retaining earnings rather than paying them out in divi￾dends. The tax status of owners, the owners’ investment opportunities, and the 
potential dilution of ownership are important owner considerations. Finally, 
market considerations are related to the stockholders’ preference for the contin￾uous payment of fixed or increasing streams of dividends.
LG 4 Review and evaluate the three basic types of dividend policies. With a 
constant-payout-ratio dividend policy, the firm pays a fixed percentage of earn￾ings to the owners each period; dividends move up and down with earnings, and 
no dividend is paid when a loss occurs. Under a regular dividend policy, the firm 
pays a fixed-dollar dividend each period; it increases the amount of dividends 
only after a proven increase in earnings. The low-regular-and-extra dividend 
policy is similar to the regular dividend policy except that it pays an extra divi￾dend when the firm’s earnings are higher than normal.
LG 5 Evaluate stock dividends from accounting, shareholder, and company 
points of view. Firms may pay stock dividends as a replacement for or supple￾ment to cash dividends. The payment of stock dividends involves a shifting of 
funds between capital accounts rather than an outflow of funds. Stock dividends 
do not change the market value of stockholders’ holdings, proportion of owner￾ship, or share of total earnings. Therefore, stock dividends are usually nontaxable. 
However, stock dividends may satisfy owners and enable the firm to preserve its 
market value without having to use cash.
LG 6 Explain stock splits and the firm’s motivation for undertaking them. 
Stock splits are used to enhance trading activity of a firm’s shares by lowering 
or raising their market price. A stock split merely involves accounting adjust￾ments; it has no effect on the firm’s cash or on its capital structure and is usu￾ally nontaxable.638 PART 6   Long-Term Financial Decisions
To retire outstanding shares, firms can repurchase stock in lieu of paying a 
cash dividend. Reducing the number of outstanding shares increases earnings 
per share and the market price per share. Stock repurchases also defer the tax 
payments of stockholders.

Whirlpool indicated that the date of record for the dividend would be Friday, 
May 17, and that the payment date would be Saturday, June 15. When would 
you expect the stock to go ex dividend? The market price of Whirlpool stock 
just before the ex dividend date was $129. Immediately after the stock went ex 
dividend, the market price was $129.67. Is that price change surprising? Calcu￾late the return that an investor might have earned if she had purchased the stock 
before the ex dividend date, sold the stock immediately afterward, and received

O’Grady Apparel Company
O
’Grady Apparel Company was founded nearly 160 years ago when an Irish mer￾chant named Garrett O’Grady landed in Los Angeles with an inventory of heavy 
canvas, which he hoped to sell for tents and wagon covers to miners headed for the 
California goldfields. Instead, he turned to the sale of harder-wearing clothing.
Today, O’Grady Apparel Company is a small manufacturer of fabrics and 
clothing whose stock is traded in the OTC market. In 2015, the Los Angeles–based 
company experienced sharp increases in both domestic and European markets re￾sulting in record earnings. Sales rose from $15.9 million in 2014 to $18.3 million in 
2015 with earnings per share of $3.28 and $3.84, respectively.
European sales represented 29% of total sales in 2015, up from 24% the year 
before and only 3% in 2010, 1 year after foreign operations were launched. Al￾though foreign sales represent nearly one-third of total sales, the growth in the do￾mestic market is expected to affect the company most markedly. Management ex￾pects sales to surpass $21 million in 2016, and earnings per share are expected to 
rise to $4.40. (Selected income statement items are presented in Table 1.)
Because of the recent growth, Margaret Jennings, the corporate treasurer, is 
concerned that available funds are not being used to their fullest potential. The pro￾jected $1,300,000 of internally generated 2016 funds is expected to be insufficient to 
meet the company’s expansion needs. Management has set a policy of maintaining 
the current capital structure proportions of 25% long-term debt, 10% preferred 
stock, and 65% common stock equity for at least the next 3 years. In addition, it 
plans to continue paying out 40% of its earnings as dividends. Total capital expen￾ditures are yet to be determined.
Jennings has been presented with several competing investment opportunities by 
division and product managers. However, because funds are limited, choices of 
which projects to accept must be made. A list of investment opportunities is shown 
in Table 2. To analyze the effect of the increased financing requirements on the 
weighted average cost of capital (WACC), Jennings contacted a leading investment 
banking firm that provided the financing cost data given in Table 3. O’Grady is in 
the 40% tax bracket.

Financing Cost Data
Long-term debt: The firm can raise $700,000 of additional debt by selling 10-year, $1,000, 
12% annual interest rate bonds to net $970 after flotation costs. Any debt in excess of 
$700,000 will have a before-tax cost, rd
, of 18%.
Preferred stock: Preferred stock, regardless of the amount sold, can be issued with a $60 par 
value and a 17% annual dividend rate. It will net $57 per share after flotation costs.
Common stock equity: The firm expects its dividends and earnings to continue to grow at a 
constant rate of 15% per year. The firm’s stock is currently selling for $20 per share. The 
firm expects to have $1,300,000 of available retained earnings. Once the retained earnings 
have been exhausted, the firm can raise additional funds by selling new common stock, net￾ting $16 per share after underpricing and flotation costs.
Source of capital Range of new financing After-tax cost (%)
Long-term debt $0–$700,000 _________
  $700,000 and above _________
Preferred stock $0 and above _________
Common stock equity $0–$1,300,000 _________
  $1,300,000 and above _________
b. (1) Determine the break point associated with common equity. A break point 
represents the total amount of financing that the firm can raise before it trig￾gers an increase in the cost of a particular financing source. For example, 
O’Grady plans to use 25% long-term debt in its capital structure. So, for ev￾ery $1 in debt that the firm uses, it will use $3 from other financing sources 
(total financing is then $4, and because $1 comes from long-term debt, its 650
share in the total is the desired 25%). From Table 3, we see that after the 
firm raises $700,000 in long-term debt, the cost of this financing source be￾gins to rise. Therefore, the firm can raise total capital of $2.8 million before 
the cost of debt will rise ($700,000 in debt plus $2.1 million in other sources 
to maintain the 25% proportion for debt), and $2.8 million is the break 
point for debt. If the firms wants to maintain a capital structure with 25% 
long-term debt and it also wants to raise more than $2.8 million in total 
financing, it will require more than $700,000 in long-term debt, and it will 
trigger the higher cost of the additional debt it issues beyond $700,000.
(2) Using the break points developed in part (1), determine each of the ranges of 
total new financing over which the firm’s weighted average cost of capital 
(WACC) remains constant.
(3) Calculate the weighted average cost of capital for each range of total new 
financing. Draw a graph with the WACC on the vertical axis and total 
money raised on the horizontal axis, and show how the firm’s WACC in￾creases in “steps” as the amount of money raised increases.
c. (1) Sort the investment opportunities described in Table 2 from highest to lowest 
return, and plot a line on the graph you drew in part (3) above showing how 
much money is required to fund the investments, starting with the highest re￾turn and going to the lowest. In other words, this line will plot the relation￾ship between the IRR on the firm’s investments and the total financing re￾quired to undertake those investments.
(2) Which, if any, of the available investments would you recommend that the 
firm accept? Explain your answer.
d. (1) Assuming that the specific financing costs do not change, what effect would 
a shift to a more highly leveraged capital structure consisting of 50% long￾term debt, 10% preferred stock, and 40% common stock have on your pre￾vious findings? (Note: Rework parts b and c using these capital structure 
weights.)
(2) Which capital structure—the original one or this one—seems better? Why?
e. (1) What type of dividend policy does the firm appear to employ? Does it seem 
appropriate given the firm’s recent growth in sales and profits and given its 
current investment opportunities?
(2) Would you recommend an alternative dividend policy? Explain. How would 
this policy affect the investments recommended in part c(2)?651

Short-Term Financial

Chapters in This Part
S
hort-term financial decisions are guided by the same financial management 
principles as long-term financial decisions, but the time frame is different: days, 
weeks, and months rather than years. Working capital management focuses on 
the management of short-term cash flows by evaluating their timing, risk, and im￾pact on firm value. Although long-term financial decisions ultimately determine the 
firm’s ability to maximize shareholder wealth, there may not be a long term if fi￾nancial managers fail to make effective short-term financial decisions. 
Chapter 15 discusses the techniques and strategies for managing working capital 
and current assets. The fundamentals of net working capital and the importance of 
the cash conversion cycle are introduced. Chapter 16 discusses the importance 
of controlling accounts payable expenses and managing other current liabilities. 
You will learn how some companies use current liabilities, including accounts pay￾able, accruals, lines of credit, commercial paper, and short-term loans, to finance 
current assets. Successful adherence to the fundamentals of working capital man￾agement will help ensure that the firm can meet its operating obligations and 
maximize its long-term investments.

Worries about Liquidity Occupy the Minds 
of Treasury Managers
I
n its annual survey of corporate treasury managers, Global 
Treasury News discovered that the number one risk on the 
minds of treasury professionals at North American and Euro￾pean companies in 2013 was liquidity risk. Liquidity risk refers 
to the possibility that a firm will not have cash or access to cash 
through the credit markets when it is needed. Concerns about li￾quidity risk in 2013 were probably a lingering effect of the 
global financial crisis in 2008. During that period, many firms 
found that funding sources they had relied on in the past, such 
as bank credit lines and commercial paper, suddenly dried up. 
Firms then scrambled to conserve cash, and that, in turn, contrib￾uted to a severe global recession. Not surprisingly, in the years 
after the crisis, firms began to build up their cash reserves. A 2012 study by Moody’s found that 
U.S. companies were holding more than $1.2 trillion in cash, an all-time high.
Although holding large cash reserves can protect firms against a liquidity crisis, there are 
downsides to that strategy. Firms typically invest their cash reserves in short-term, low-risk assets, 
and returns on those assets in 2013 were at historic lows. For example, yields on short-term Trea￾sury bills in 2013 ranged from 0.01 to 0.20 percent, depending on maturity. The company with 
the largest cash balance during this period was Apple, Inc. With more than $100 billion in cash, 
Apple attracted criticism from shareholders who wanted the company to either put the cash in in￾vestments that would earn higher returns or distribute the cash to stockholders through dividends or 
share repurchases.
Cash is just one component of a firm’s working capital, but the issues that firms must balance 
when deciding how much cash to hold also arise in the management of other working capital items 
such as receivables, inventories, and payables. This chapter explains the trade-offs involved in man￾aging working capital and how managers should evaluate those trade-offs.
Treasury Risk Survey 2013654 PART 7   Short-Term Financial Decisions
 
 15.1 Net Working Capital Fundamentals
The balance sheet provides information about the structure of a firm’s invest￾ments on the one hand and the structure of its financing sources on the other 
hand. The structures chosen should consistently lead to the maximization of the 
value of the owners’ investment in the firm.
WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The importance of efficient working capital management is indisputable given 
that a firm’s viability relies on the financial manager’s ability to effectively 
manage receivables, inventory, and payables. The goal of working capital (or 
short-term financial) management is to manage each of the firm’s current as￾sets (inventory, accounts receivable, marketable securities, and cash) and cur￾rent liabilities (notes payable, accruals, and accounts payable) to achieve a 
balance between profitability and risk that contributes positively to the firm’s 
value.
Firms are able to reduce financing costs or increase the funds available for 
expansion by minimizing the amount of funds tied up in working capital. 
Therefore, it should not be surprising to learn that working capital is one of 
the financial manager’s most important and time-consuming activities. Surveys 
by CFO magazine and Duke University have found that corporate CFOs spend 
almost 30 hours per month engaged in working capital and cash management, 
which is more time than they spend on any other single activity. Similar sur￾veys have found that CFOs believe that their efforts to manage working capital 
effectively add as much value to the firm as any other activity in which they 
engage.
LG 1

Management of current assets 
and current liabilities.
Matter of fact
A survey of CFOs from firms around the world suggests that working capital management is 
at the top of the list of most valued finance functions. Among 19 different finance functions, 
CFOs viewed working capital management as equally important as capital structure, debt issu￾ance and management, bank relationships, and tax management. Their satisfaction with the per￾formance of working capital management was quite the opposite, however. CFOs viewed the 
performance of working capital management as being better only than the performance of pen￾sion management. Consistent with their view that working capital management is a high-value but 
low-satisfaction activity, it was identified as the finance function second most in need of additional 
resources.1

Next, we use net working capital to consider the relationship between cur￾rent assets and current liabilities and then use the cash conversion cycle to con￾sider the key aspects of current asset management. In Chapter 16, we consider 
current liability management.ChAPTER 15   Working Capital and Current Assets Management 655
NET WORKING CAPITAL
Current assets, commonly called working capital, represent the portion of invest￾ment that circulates from one form to another in the ordinary conduct of business. 
This idea embraces the recurring transition from cash to inventories to accounts 
receivable and back to cash. As cash substitutes, marketable securities are also 
part of working capital.
Current liabilities represent the firm’s short-term financing, because they in￾clude all debts of the firm that come due in 1 year or less. These debts usually 
include amounts owed to suppliers (accounts payable), employees and govern￾ments (accruals), and banks (notes payable), among others. (You can refer to 
Chapter 3 for a full discussion of balance sheet items.)
As noted in Chapter 11, net working capital is defined as the difference be￾tween the firm’s current assets and its current liabilities. When current assets ex￾ceed current liabilities, the firm has positive net working capital. When current 
assets are less than current liabilities, the firm has negative net working capital.
The conversion of current assets from inventory to accounts receivable to cash 
provides the cash used to pay current liabilities. The cash outlays for current liabil￾ities are relatively predictable. When an obligation is incurred, the firm generally 
knows when the corresponding payment will be due. What is difficult to predict 
are the cash inflows: the conversion of the current assets to more liquid forms. The 
more predictable its cash inflows, the less net working capital a firm needs. Be￾cause most firms are unable to match cash inflows to cash outflows with certainty, 
they usually need current assets that more than cover outflows for current liabili￾ties. In general, the greater the margin by which a firm’s current assets cover its 
current liabilities, the better able it will be to pay its bills as they come due.
TRAdE-OFF BETWEEN PROFITABILITY ANd RISK
A trade-off exists between a firm’s profitability and its risk. Profitability, in this 
context, is the relationship between revenues and costs generated by using the 
firm’s assets—both current and fixed—in productive activities. A firm can increase 
its profits by (1) increasing revenues or (2) decreasing costs. Risk, in the context of 
working capital management, is the probability that a firm will be unable to pay 
its bills as they come due. A firm that cannot pay its bills as they come due is said 
to be insolvent. It is generally assumed that the greater the firm’s net working 
capital, the lower its risk. In other words, the more net working capital, the more 
liquid the firm and therefore the lower its risk of becoming insolvent. Using these 
definitions of profitability and risk, we can demonstrate the trade-off between 
them by considering changes in current assets and current liabilities separately.
Changes in Current Assets
We can demonstrate how changing the level of the firm’s current assets affects its 
profitability–risk trade-off by using the ratio of current assets to total assets. This 
ratio indicates the percentage of total assets that is current. For purposes of illus￾tration, we will assume that the level of total assets remains unchanged. The ef￾fects on both profitability and risk of an increase or decrease in this ratio are 
summarized in the upper portion of Table 15.1. When the ratio increases—that 
is, when current assets increase—profitability decreases. Why? The answer is be￾cause current assets are less profitable than fixed assets. Fixed assets are more

profitable because they add more value to the product than that provided by cur￾rent assets. 
The risk effect, however, decreases as the ratio of current assets to total assets 
increases. The increase in current assets increases net working capital, thereby 
reducing the risk of insolvency. In addition, as you go down the asset side of the 
balance sheet, the risk associated with the assets increases: Investment in cash and 
marketable securities is less risky than investment in accounts receivable, invento￾ries, and fixed assets. Accounts receivable investment is less risky than investment 
in inventories and fixed assets. Investment in inventories is less risky than invest￾ment in fixed assets. The nearer an asset is to cash, the less risky it is. The oppo￾site effects on profit and risk result from a decrease in the ratio of current assets 
to total assets.
In an effort to manage the risk effect, firms have been steadily moving away 
from riskier current asset components, such as inventory. Figure 15.1 shows that 
over time current assets consistently account for about 60 percent of total assets 
in U.S. manufacturing firms, but inventory levels are dropping dramatically. That 
current assets relative to total assets remains fairly constant while inventory in￾vestment is shrinking indicates that U.S. manufacturing firms are substituting less 
risky current assets for inventory, the riskiest current asset. Indeed, Figure 15.1 
shows that cash levels are increasing relative to total assets.

Changes in Current Liabilities
We also can demonstrate how changing the level of the firm’s current liabilities 
affects its profitability–risk trade-off by using the ratio of current liabilities to 
total assets. This ratio indicates the percentage of total assets that has been fi￾nanced with current liabilities. Again, assuming that total assets remain un￾changed, the effects on both profitability and risk of an increase or decrease in 
the ratio are summarized in the lower portion of Table 15.1. When the ratio in￾creases, profitability increases. Why? Here it is because the firm uses more of the 
less-expensive current liabilities financing and less long-term financing. Current 
liabilities are less expensive because only notes payable, which represent about 
20 percent of the typical manufacturer’s current liabilities, have a cost. The other 
current liabilities are basically debts on which the firm pays no charge or interest. 
However, when the ratio of current liabilities to total assets increases, the risk of 
insolvency also increases because the increase in current liabilities in turn de￾creases net working capital. The opposite effects on profit and risk result from a 
decrease in the ratio of current liabilities to total assets.

 15.2 Cash Conversion Cycle
Central to working capital management is an understanding of the firm’s cash 
conversion cycle. The cash conversion cycle (CCC) measures the length of time 
required for a company to convert cash invested in its operations to cash received 
as a result of its operations. This cycle frames discussion of the management of 
the firm’s current assets in this chapter and that of the management of current 
liabilities in Chapter 16. Here, we begin by demonstrating the calculation and 
application of the cash conversion cycle.
CALCuLATING ThE CASh CONVERSION CYCLE
A firm’s operating cycle (OC) is the time from the beginning of the production 
process to collection of cash from the sale of the finished product. The operating 
cycle encompasses two major short-term asset categories, inventory and accounts 
receivable. It is measured in elapsed time by summing the average age of inven￾tory (AAI) and the average collection period (ACP):
OC = AAI + ACP (15.1)

a company to convert cash

of the finished product.
LG 2658 PART 7   Short-Term Financial Decisions
However, the process of producing and selling a product also includes the 
purchase of production inputs (raw materials) on account, which results in ac￾counts payable. Accounts payable reduce the number of days a firm’s resources 
are tied up in the operating cycle. The time it takes to pay the accounts payable, 
measured in days, is the average payment period (APP). The operating cycle less 
the average payment period yields the cash conversion cycle. The formula for the 
cash conversion cycle is
CCC = OC - APP (15.2)
Substituting the relationship in Equation 15.1 into Equation 15.2, we can 
see that the cash conversion cycle has three main components—(1) average 
age of the inventory, (2) average collection period, and (3) average payment 
period—so
CCC = AAI + ACP - APP (15.3)
Clearly, if a firm changes any of these time periods, it changes the amount of re￾sources tied up in the day-to-day operation of the firm.
In its 2012 annual report, Whirlpool Corporation reported that it had reve￾nues of $18.1 billion, cost of goods sold of $15.2 billion, accounts receivable of 
2.0 billion, and inventory of $2.4 billion. From this information (and assuming 
for simplicity that cost of goods sold equals purchases), we can determine that the 
company’s average age of inventory was 58 days, its average collection period 
was 40 days, and its average payment period was 89 days. Thus, the cash conver￾sion cycle for Whirlpool was just 9 days (58 + 40 - 89). Figure 15.2 presents 
Whirlpool’s cash conversion cycle as a time line.
The resources Whirlpool had invested in this cash conversion cycle (assuming 
a 365-day year) were
 Inventory = $15.2 billion * (58 , 365) = $2.4
1 Accounts receivable 5 18.1 billion 3 (40 4 365) 5 2.0
- Accounts payable 5 15.2 billion 3 (89 4 365) 5 3.7
5 Resources invested 5 $0.7
With roughly $700 million committed to working capital, Whirlpool was surely 
motivated to make improvements. Changes in any of the component cycles will 
change the resources tied up in Whirlpool’s operations. For example, if Whirl￾pool could reduce its collection period from 40 days to 30 days, holding all else 
equal, its working capital requirement would fall by more than $500 million. It is 
clear why companies pay close attention to working capital management.
FuNdING REQuIREMENTS OF ThE CASh CONVERSION CYCLE
We can use the cash conversion cycle as a basis for discussing how the firm funds 
its required investment in operating assets. We first differentiate between perma￾nent and seasonal funding needs and then describe aggressive and conservative 
seasonal funding strategies.
Example 15.1 ▶

A firm can lower its work￾ing capital if it can speed

credit (like a Visa card), it will 
receive cash sooner after the 
sale is transacted than if it has 
to wait until the customer pays 
its accounts receivable.

Permanent versus Seasonal Funding Needs
If the firm’s sales are constant, its investment in operating assets should also be 
constant, and the firm will have only a permanent funding requirement. If the 
firm’s sales are cyclic, its investment in operating assets will vary over time with its 
sales cycles, and the firm will have seasonal funding requirements in addition to 
the permanent funding required for its minimum investment in operating assets.
Nicholson Company holds, on average, $50,000 in cash and marketable securi￾ties, $1,250,000 in inventory, and $750,000 in accounts receivable. Nicholson’s 
business is very stable over time, so its operating assets can be viewed as perma￾nent. In addition, Nicholson’s accounts payable of $425,000 are stable over time. 
Thus, Nicholson has a permanent investment in operating assets of $1,625,000 
($50,000 + $1,250,0000 + $750,000 - $425,000). That amount would also 
equal its permanent funding requirement.
In contrast, Semper Pump Company, which produces bicycle pumps, has 
seasonal funding needs. Semper has seasonal sales, with its peak sales being 
driven by the summertime purchases of bicycle pumps. Semper holds, at mini￾mum, $25,000 in cash and marketable securities, $100,000 in inventory, and 
$60,000 in accounts receivable. At peak times, Semper’s inventory increases to 
$750,000, and its accounts receivable increase to $400,000. To capture pro￾duction efficiencies, Semper produces pumps at a constant rate throughout the 
year. Thus, accounts payable remain at $50,000 throughout the year. Accord￾ingly, Semper has a permanent funding requirement for its minimum level of 
operating assets of $135,000 ($25,000 + $100,000 + $60,000 - $50,000)
and peak seasonal funding requirements (in excess of its permanent need) of

$990,000 3 ($25,000 + $750,000 + $400,000 - $50,000) - $135,0004 . Sem￾per’s total funding requirements for operating assets vary from a minimum of 
$135,000 (permanent) to a seasonal peak of $1,125,000 ($135,000 + $990,000).
Figure 15.3 depicts these needs over time.
Aggressive versus Conservative Seasonal Funding Strategies
Short-term funds are typically less expensive than long-term funds. That is, inter￾est rates on short-term loans are typically lower than rates on long-term loans 
because the yield curve is typically upward sloping. However, long-term funds 
allow the firm to lock in its cost of funds over a period of time and thus avoid the 
risk of increases in short-term interest rates. Also, long-term funding ensures that 
the required funds are available to the firm when needed. Short-term funding 
exposes the firm to the risk that it may not be able to obtain the funds needed to 
cover its seasonal peaks. Under an aggressive funding strategy, the firm funds its 
seasonal requirements with short-term debt and its permanent requirements with 
long-term debt. Under a conservative funding strategy, the firm funds both its 
seasonal and its permanent requirements with long-term debt.
Semper Pump Company has a permanent funding requirement of $135,000 in 
operating assets and seasonal funding requirements that vary between $0 and 
$990,000 and average $101,250 (calculated from data not shown). If Semper can 
borrow short-term funds at 6.25% and long-term funds at 8%, and if it can earn 
5% on the investment of any surplus balances, then the annual cost of an aggres￾sive strategy for seasonal funding will be
Cost of short@term financing = 0.0625 * $101,250 = $ 6,328.13
+ Cost of long@term financing = 0.0800 * 135,000 = 10,800.00
- Earnings on surplus balances = 0.0500 * 0 = 0
 Total cost of aggressive strategy $17,128.13

Because under this strategy the amount of financing exactly equals the estimated 
funding need, no surplus balances exist.
Alternatively, Semper can choose a conservative strategy, under which sur￾plus cash balances are fully invested. (In Figure 15.3, this surplus will be the dif￾ference between the peak need of $1,125,000 and the total need, which varies 
between $135,000 and $1,125,000 during the year.) The cost of the conservative 
strategy will be
Cost of short@term financing = 0.0625 * $ 0 = $ 0
+ Cost of long@term financing = 0.0800 * 1,125,000 = 90,000.00
- Earnings on surplus balances = 0.0500 * 888,750 = 44,437.50
 Total cost of conservative strategy $45,562.50
The average surplus balance would be calculated by subtracting the sum of 
the permanent need ($135,000) and the average seasonal need ($101,250) 
from the seasonal peak need ($1,125,000) to get $888,750 
($1,125,000 - $135,000 - $101,250). This represents the surplus amount of 
financing that on average could be invested in short-term assets that earn a 5% 
annual return.
It is clear from these calculations that for Semper, the aggressive strategy is 
far less expensive than the conservative strategy. However, it is equally clear 
that Semper has substantial peak-season operating-asset needs and that it must 
have adequate funding available to meet the peak needs and ensure ongoing 
operations.
Clearly, the aggressive strategy’s heavy reliance on short-term financing 
makes it riskier than the conservative strategy because of interest rate swings and 
possible difficulties in obtaining needed short-term financing quickly when sea￾sonal peaks occur. The conservative strategy avoids these risks through the 
locked-in interest rate and long-term financing, but it is more costly because of 
the negative spread between the earnings rate on surplus funds (5 percent in the 
example) and the cost of the long-term funds that create the surplus (8 percent in 
the example). Where the firm operates, between the extremes of the aggressive 
and conservative seasonal funding strategies, depends on management’s disposi￾tion toward risk and the strength of its banking relationships.
STRATEGIES FOR MANAGING ThE CASh CONVERSION CYCLE
Some firms establish a target cash conversion cycle and then monitor and manage 
the actual cash conversion cycle toward the targeted value. A positive cash con￾version cycle, as was the case for Whirlpool in 2012, means the firm must use 
negotiated liabilities (such as bank loans) to support its operating assets. Negoti￾ated liabilities carry an explicit cost, so the firm benefits by minimizing their use 
in supporting operating assets. Simply stated, the goal is to minimize the length of 
the cash conversion cycle, which minimizes negotiated liabilities. This goal can be 
realized through use of the following strategies:
 1. Turn over inventory as quickly as possible without stockouts that result in 
lost sales.
 2. Collect accounts receivable as quickly as possible without losing sales from 
high-pressure collection techniques.662 PART 7   Short-Term Financial Decisions
 3. Manage mail, processing, and clearing time to reduce them when collecting 
from customers and to increase them when paying suppliers.
 4. Pay accounts payable as slowly as possible without damaging the firm’s 
credit rating or its relationships with suppliers.
Techniques for implementing these four strategies are the focus of the remainder 
of this chapter and the following chapter.

 15.3 Inventory Management
The first component of the cash conversion cycle is the average age of inventory. 
The objective for managing inventory, as noted earlier, is to turn over inventory 
as quickly as possible without losing sales from stockouts. The financial manager 
tends to act as an advisor or “watchdog” in matters concerning inventory. He or 
she does not have direct control over inventory but does provide input to the in￾ventory management process.
dIFFERING VIEWPOINTS ABOuT INVENTORY LEVEL
Differing viewpoints about appropriate inventory levels commonly exist among a 
firm’s finance, marketing, manufacturing, and purchasing managers. Each views 
inventory levels in light of his or her own objectives. The financial manager’s
general disposition toward inventory levels is to keep them low, to ensure that the 
firm’s money is not being unwisely invested in excess resources. The marketing 
manager, on the other hand, would like to have large inventories of the firm’s 
finished products. This would ensure that all orders could be filled quickly, elim￾inating the need for backorders due to stockouts.
The manufacturing manager’s major responsibility is to implement the produc￾tion plan so that it results in the desired amount of finished goods of acceptable 
quality available on time at a low cost. In fulfilling this role, the manufacturing 
manager would keep raw materials inventories high to avoid production delays. 
He or she also would favor large production runs for the sake of lower unit pro￾duction costs, which would result in high finished goods inventories.
The purchasing manager is concerned solely with the raw materials invento￾ries. He or she must have on hand, in the correct quantities at the desired times 
and at a favorable price, whatever raw materials are required by production. 
LG 3ChAPTER 15   Working Capital and Current Assets Management 663
Without proper control, in an effort to get quantity discounts or in anticipation 
of rising prices or a shortage of certain materials, the purchasing manager may 
purchase larger quantities of resources than are actually needed at the time.
COMMON TEChNIQuES FOR MANAGING INVENTORY
Numerous techniques are available for effectively managing the firm’s inventory. 
Here we briefly consider four commonly used techniques.
ABC System
A firm using the ABC inventory system divides its inventory into three groups: A, 
B, and C. The A group includes those items with the largest dollar investment. 
Typically, this group consists of 20 percent of the firm’s inventory items but 
80 percent of its investment in inventory. The B group consists of items that ac￾count for the next largest investment in inventory. The C group consists of a large 
number of items that require a relatively small investment.
The inventory group of each item determines the item’s level of monitoring. 
The A group items receive the most intense monitoring because of the high dollar 
investment. Typically, A group items are tracked on a perpetual inventory system 
that allows daily verification of each item’s inventory level. B group items are 
frequently controlled through periodic, perhaps weekly, checking of their levels. 
C group items are monitored with unsophisticated techniques, such as the two￾bin method. With the two-bin method, the item is stored in two bins. As an item 
is needed, inventory is removed from the first bin. When that bin is empty, an 
order is placed to refill the first bin while inventory is drawn from the second bin. 
The second bin is used until empty, and so on.
The large dollar investment in A and B group items suggests the need for a 
better method of inventory management than the ABC system. The EOQ model, 
discussed next, is an appropriate model for the management of A and B group 
items.
Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Model
One of the most common techniques for determining the optimal order size for 
inventory items is the economic order quantity (EOQ) model. The EOQ model 
considers various costs of inventory and then determines what order size mini￾mizes total inventory cost.
EOQ assumes that the relevant costs of inventory can be divided into order 
costs and carrying costs. (The model excludes the actual cost of the inventory item.) 
Each of them has certain key components and characteristics. Order costs include 
the fixed clerical costs of placing and receiving orders: the cost of writing a pur￾chase order, of processing the resulting paperwork, and of receiving an order and 
checking it against the invoice. Order costs are stated in dollars per order. Carrying 
costs are the variable costs per unit of holding an item of inventory for a specific 
period of time. Carrying costs include storage costs, insurance costs, the costs of 
deterioration and obsolescence, and the opportunity or financial cost of having 
funds invested in inventory. These costs are stated in dollars per unit per period.
Order costs decrease as the size of the order increases. Carrying costs, how￾ever, increase with increases in the order size. The EOQ model analyzes the trade￾off between order costs and carrying costs to determine the order quantity that 
minimizes the total inventory cost.

Mathematical Development of EOQ A formula can be developed for deter￾mining the firm’s EOQ for a given inventory item, where
S = usage in units per period
O = order cost per order
C = carrying cost per unit per period
Q = order quantity in units
The first step is to derive the cost functions for order cost and carrying cost. 
The order cost can be expressed as the product of the cost per order and the 
number of orders. Because the number of orders equals the usage during the 
period divided by the order quantity (S/Q), the order cost can be expressed as 
follows:
Order cost = O * (S , Q) (15.4)
The carrying cost is defined as the cost of carrying a unit of inventory per period 
multiplied by the firm’s average inventory. The average inventory is the order 
quantity divided by 2 (Q/2), because inventory is assumed to be depleted at a 
constant rate. Thus, carrying cost can be expressed as
Carrying cost = C * (Q , 2) (15.5)
The firm’s total cost of inventory is found by summing the order cost and the 
carrying cost. Thus, the total cost function is
Total cost = 3O * (S , Q) 4 + 3C * (Q , 2) 4 (15.6)
Because the EOQ is defined as the order quantity that minimizes the total cost 
function, we must solve the total cost function for the EOQ.2
 The resulting equa￾tion is
 EOQ = A
2 * S * O
C
(15.7)
Although the EOQ model has weaknesses, it is certainly better than subjective 
decision making. Even though the use of the EOQ model is outside the control of 
the financial manager, the financial manager must be aware of its utility and must 
provide certain inputs, specifically with respect to inventory carrying costs.

carrying costs of inventory.
2. In this simple model, the EOQ occurs at the point where the order cost 3O * (S , Q)4 just equals the carrying 
cost 3C * (Q , 2)4 . To demonstrate, we set the two costs equal and solve for Q:
3O * (S , Q)4 = 3C * (Q , 2)4
Then cross-multiplying, we get
2 * O * S = C * Q2
Dividing both sides by C, we get
Q2 = (2 * O * S) , C
so
Q = 2(2 * O * S) , CChAPTER 15   Working Capital and Current Assets Management 665
Individuals sometimes are confronted with personal finance 
decisions involving cost trade-offs similar to the trade-off be￾tween the fixed order costs and variable carrying costs of inventory that corpora￾tions face. Take the case of the von Dammes, who are trying to decide whether a 
conventional car (uses gas) or a hybrid car (uses gas and electric battery) would 
be more cost effective.
The von Dammes plan to keep whichever car they choose for 3 years and ex￾pect to drive it 12,000 miles in each of those years. They will use the same dollar 
amount of financing repaid under the same terms for either car, and they expect 
the cars to have identical repair costs over the 3-year ownership period. They also 
assume that the trade-in value of the two cars at the end of 3 years will be identi￾cal. Both cars use regular unleaded gas, which they estimate will cost, on average, 
$3.20 per gallon over the 3 years. The key data for each car are as follows:
Personal Finance Example 15.4 ▶
  Conventional Hybrid
Total cost $24,500 $27,300
Average miles per gallon 27 42
We can begin by calculating the total fuel cost for each car over the 3-year 
ownership period:
Conventional: 3 (3 years * 12,000 miles per year) , 27 miles per gallon4
* $3.20 per gallon
= 1,333.33 gallons * $3.20 per gallon = $4,267
 Hybrid: 3 (3 years * 12,000 miles per year) , 42 miles per gallon4
* $3.20 per gallon
= 857.14 gallons * $3.20 per gallon = $2,743
To buy the hybrid car, the von Dammes will have to pay $2,800 more 
($27,300 - $24,500) than the cost of the conventional car, but they will save 
about $1,524 ($4,267 - $2,743) in fuel costs over the 3-year ownership period. 
Ignoring differences in timing, on a strict economic basis they should buy the con￾ventional car because the $2,800 marginal cost of the hybrid results in a marginal 
fuel cost savings of only $1,524. Clearly, other factors such as environmental con￾cerns and the reasonableness of the assumptions could affect their decision.
Reorder Point Once the firm has determined its economic order quantity, it 
must determine when to place an order. The reorder point reflects the number of 
days of lead time the firm needs to place and receive an order and the firm’s daily 
usage of the inventory item. Assuming that inventory is used at a constant rate, 
the formula for the reorder point is
Reorder point = Days of lead time * Daily usage (15.8)
For example, if a firm knows it takes 3 days to place and receive an order and 
if it uses 15 units per day of the inventory item, the reorder point is 45 units 
reorder point
The point at which to reorder 
inventory, expressed as days of 
lead time * daily usage.666 PART 7   Short-Term Financial Decisions
of inventory (3 days * 15 units/day). Thus, as soon as the item’s inventory level 
falls to the reorder point (45 units, in this case), an order will be placed at the 
item’s EOQ. If the estimates of lead time and usage are correct, the order will ar￾rive exactly as the inventory level reaches zero. However, lead times and usage 
rates are not precise, so most firms hold safety stock (extra inventory) to prevent 
stockouts of important items.
MAX Company, a producer of dinnerware, has an A group inventory item that is 
vital to the production process. This item costs $1,500, and MAX uses 1,100 
units of the item per year. MAX wants to determine its optimal order strategy for 
the item. To calculate the EOQ, we need the following inputs:
Order cost per order = $150
Carrying cost per unit per year = $200
Substituting into Equation 15.7, we get
EOQ = A
2 * 1,100 * $150
$200 ≈ 41 units
The reorder point for MAX depends on the number of days MAX operates 
per year. Assuming that MAX operates 250 days per year and uses 1,100 units of 
this item, its daily usage is 4.4 units (1,100 , 250). If its lead time is 2 days and 
MAX wants to maintain a safety stock of 4 units, the reorder point for this item 
is 3 (2 * 4.4) + 44 , or 12.8 units. However, orders are made only in whole units, 
so the order is placed when the inventory falls to 13 units.
The firm’s goal for inventory is to turn it over as quickly as possible without 
stockouts. Inventory turnover is best calculated by dividing cost of goods sold by 
average inventory. The EOQ model determines the optimal order size and, indi￾rectly, through the assumption of constant usage, the average inventory. Thus, 
the EOQ model determines the firm’s optimal inventory turnover rate, given the 
firm’s specific costs of inventory.
Just-in-Time (JIT) System
The just-in-time (JIT) system is used to minimize inventory investment. The phi￾losophy is that materials should arrive at exactly the time they are needed for 
production. Ideally, the firm would have only work-in-process inventory. Be￾cause its objective is to minimize inventory investment, a JIT system uses no (or 
very little) safety stock. Extensive coordination among the firm’s employees, its 
suppliers, and shipping companies must exist to ensure that material inputs arrive 
on time. Failure of materials to arrive on time results in a shutdown of the pro￾duction line until the materials arrive. Likewise, a JIT system requires high-quality 
parts from suppliers. When quality problems arise, production must be stopped 
until the problems are resolved.
The goal of the JIT system is manufacturing efficiency. It uses inventory as a tool 
for attaining efficiency by emphasizing quality of the materials used and their timely 
delivery. When JIT is working properly, it forces process inefficiencies to surface.
Knowing the level of inventory is, of course, an important part of any in￾ventory management system. As described in the Focus on Practice box, radio

frequency identification technology may be the “next new thing” in improving 
inventory and supply chain management.
Computerized Systems for Resource Control
Today, a number of systems are available for controlling inventory and other 
resources. One of the most basic is the materials requirement planning (MRP) 
system. It is used to determine what materials to order and when to order them. 
MRP applies EOQ concepts to determine how much to order. Using a com￾puter, MRP simulates each product’s bill of materials, inventory status, and 
manufacturing process. The bill of materials is simply a list of all parts and 
materials that go into making the finished product. For a given production

analysis” are presented in Chapter 10.
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 
the world’s number one 
retailer, operates almost 11,000 retail 
units under 55 different banners in 27 
countries and employs more than two 
million people around the world. What’s 
more, Wal-Mart came in third place 
among general merchandisers in Fortune
magazine’s 2013 Most Admired Com￾panies survey. With fiscal 2013 sales 
of $469 billion, Wal-Mart is able to ex￾ert tremendous pressure on its suppliers. 
When Wal-Mart announced in April 
2004 that it was beginning a pilot pro￾gram to test radio frequency identification
(RFID) technology to improve its inventory 
and supply chain management, suppli￾ers and competitors took notice.
One of the first companies to intro￾duce bar codes in the early 1980s, 
Wal-Mart required its top 100 suppliers 
to put RFID tags on shipping crates and 
pallets by January 2005, with the next 
200 largest suppliers using the technol￾ogy by January 2006. Wal-Mart offi￾cials believed that RFID tags would 
allow the company to wring out ineffi￾ciencies from its inventory and supply 
chain operations, thereby lowering 
focus on PRACTICE

the serial number of a product, the loca￾tion of the factory that made it, when it 
was made, and when it was sold.
Wal-Mart expects the RFID technol￾ogy to improve its inventory manage￾ment, and it remains committed to ad￾vancing its use of RFID. During the 
2010 National Retail Federation’s Big 
Show convention, Wal-Mart’s chief in￾formation officer (CIO), Rollin Ford, 
said, “We’re still bullish on RFID.” He 
also indicated that Wal-Mart ran some 
apparel pilots last year that showed 
good results and that the retailer plans 
to “eat what we cook.” Wal-Mart man￾ufactures some apparel items and con￾trols its own supply chain, and Ford in￾dicated that Wal-Mart plans to use RFID 
technology in its apparel supply chain. 
Wal-Mart will then share the benefits 
and best practices with its suppliers, 
which might want to achieve the same 
benefits from the technology.

the full implementation of RFID tech￾nology in retail industries? Specifi￾cally, consider the amount of data 
that might be collected.
expenses and working capital invest￾ments. As of February 2007, Wal-Mart 
officials said that 600 of its suppliers 
were RFID-enabled. Nevertheless, Wal￾Mart’s ultimate goal to have all its 
100,000-plus suppliers on board using 
electronic product codes (EPC) with 
RFID technology began to stall. The 
company failed to show dramatic re￾ductions in inventory (in fact, inventories 
went up, not down, after the RFID pro￾gram was put in place), and some sup￾pliers resisted the change.
The major issue with RFID tags is per￾chip cost. In 2004, when Wal-Mart an￾nounced its intent to use RFID tags, the 
tags sold for 30 to 50 cents each. Wal￾Mart requested a price of 5 cents per 
tag, expecting increased demand and 
economies of scale to push the price 
down to make them more competitive 
with inexpensive barcodes. Increased 
demand has brought the price of current￾generation RFID tags to about 15 cents 
apiece, but barcodes cost only a fraction 
of a cent. Barcodes help track inventory 
and can match a product to a price, but 
they lack the electronic tags’ ability to 
store more detailed information, such as

plan, the computer simulates material requirements by comparing production 
needs to available inventory balances. On the basis of the time it takes for a 
product that is in process to move through the various production stages and 
the lead time to get materials, the MRP system determines when orders should 
be placed for various items on the bill of materials. The objective of this system 
is to lower the firm’s inventory investment without impairing production. If the 
firm’s pretax opportunity cost of capital for investments of equal risk is 20 per￾cent, every dollar of investment released from inventory will increase before-tax 
profits by $0.20.
A popular extension of MRP is manufacturing resource planning II (MRP II), 
which integrates data from numerous areas such as finance, accounting, market￾ing, engineering, and manufacturing using a sophisticated computer system. This 
system generates production plans as well as numerous financial and manage￾ment reports. In essence, it models the firm’s processes so that the effects of 
changes in one area of operations on other areas can be assessed and monitored. 
For example, the MRP II system would allow the firm to assess the effect of an 
increase in labor costs on sales and profits.
Whereas MRP and MRP II tend to focus on internal operations, enterprise 
resource planning (ERP) systems expand the focus to the external environment 
by including information about suppliers and customers. ERP electronically inte￾grates all a firm’s departments so that, for example, production can call up sales 
information and immediately know how much must be produced to fill customer 
orders. Because all available resources—human and material—are known, the 
system can eliminate production delays and control costs. ERP systems automati￾cally note changes, such as a supplier’s inability to meet a scheduled delivery date, 
so that necessary adjustments can be made.
INTERNATIONAL INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
International inventory management is typically much more complicated for ex￾porters in general, and for multinational companies in particular, than for purely 
domestic firms. The production and manufacturing economies of scale that might 
be expected from selling products globally may prove elusive if products must be 
tailored for individual local markets, as frequently happens, or if actual produc￾tion takes place in factories around the world. When raw materials, intermediate 
goods, or finished products must be transported over long distances—particularly 
by ocean shipping—there will be more delays, confusion, damage, and theft than 
occur in a one-country operation. The international inventory manager therefore 
puts a premium on flexibility. He or she is usually less concerned about ordering 
the economically optimal quantity of inventory than about making sure that suf￾ficient quantities of inventory are delivered where they are needed, when they are 
needed, and in a condition to be used as planned.

 15.4 Accounts Receivable Management
The second component of the cash conversion cycle is the average collection period. 
This period is the average length of time from a sale on credit until the payment 
becomes usable funds for the firm. The average collection period has two parts. 
The first part is the time from the sale until the customer mails the payment. The 
second part is the time from when the payment is mailed until the firm has the 
collected funds in its bank account. The first part of the average collection period 
involves managing the credit available to the firm’s customers, and the second 
part involves collecting and processing payments. This section of the chapter dis￾cusses the firm’s accounts receivable credit management.
The objective for managing accounts receivable is to collect accounts receiv￾able as quickly as possible without losing sales from high-pressure collection 
techniques. Accomplishing this goal encompasses three topics: (1) credit selection 
and standards, (2) credit terms, and (3) credit monitoring.
CREdIT SELECTION ANd STANdARdS
Credit selection involves application of techniques for determining which cus￾tomers should receive credit. This process involves evaluating the customer’s 
creditworthiness and comparing it to the firm’s credit standards, its minimum 
requirements for extending credit to a customer.
Five C’s of Credit
One popular credit selection technique is the five C’s of credit, which provides a 
framework for in-depth credit analysis. Because of the time and expense involved, 
this credit selection method is used for large-dollar credit requests. The five C’s 
are as follows:
 1. Character: The applicant’s record of meeting past obligations.
 2. Capacity: The applicant’s ability to repay the requested credit, as judged in 
terms of financial statement analysis focused on cash flows available to repay 
debt obligations.
 3. Capital: The applicant’s debt relative to equity.
 4. Collateral: The amount of assets the applicant has available for use in secur￾ing the credit. The larger the amount of available assets, the greater the 
chance that a firm will recover funds if the applicant defaults.
 5. Conditions: Current general and industry-specific economic conditions and 
any unique conditions surrounding a specific transaction.
Analysis via the five C’s of credit does not yield a specific accept/reject deci￾sion, so its use requires an analyst experienced in reviewing and granting credit 
requests. Application of this framework tends to ensure that the firm’s credit 
customers will pay, without being pressured, within the stated credit terms.

Credit Scoring
Credit scoring is a method of credit selection that firms commonly use with high￾volume/small-dollar credit requests. Credit scoring applies statistically derived 
weights to a credit applicant’s scores on key financial and credit characteristics to 
predict whether he or she will pay the requested credit in a timely fashion. Simply 
stated, the procedure results in a score that measures the applicant’s overall credit 
strength, and the score is used to make the accept/reject decision for granting the 
applicant credit. Credit scoring is most commonly used by large credit card opera￾tions, such as those of banks, oil companies, and department stores. The purpose of 
credit scoring is to make a relatively informed credit decision quickly and inexpen￾sively, recognizing that the cost of a single bad scoring decision is small. However, if 
bad debts from scoring decisions increase, the scoring system must be reevaluated.
Changing Credit Standards
The firm sometimes will contemplate changing its credit standards in an effort to 
improve its returns and create greater value for its owners. To demonstrate, con￾sider the following changes and effects on profits expected to result from the re￾laxation of credit standards.

Effects of Relaxation of Credit Standards
Variable Direction of change Effect on profits
Sales volume Increase Positive
Investment in accounts receivable Increase Negative
Bad-debt expenses Increase Negative
If credit standards were tightened, the opposite effects would be expected.
Dodd Tool, a manufacturer of lathe tools, is currently selling a product for $10 
per unit. Sales (all on credit) for last year were 60,000 units. The variable cost per 
unit is $6. The firm’s total fixed costs are $120,000.
The firm is currently contemplating a relaxation of credit standards that is ex￾pected to result in the following: a 5% increase in unit sales to 63,000 units; an 
increase in the average collection period from 30 days (the current level) to 45 days; 
an increase in bad-debt expenses from 1% of sales (the current level) to 2%. The 
firm determines that its cost of tying up funds in receivables is 15% before taxes.
To determine whether to relax its credit standards, Dodd Tool must calculate 
its effect on the firm’s additional profit contribution from sales, the cost of the 
marginal investment in accounts receivable, and the cost of marginal bad debts.
Additional Profit Contribution from Sales Because fixed costs are “sunk” and 
therefore are unaffected by a change in the sales level, the only cost relevant to a 
change in sales is variable costs. Sales are expected to increase by 5%, or 3,000 
units. The profit contribution per unit will equal the difference between the sale 
price per unit ($10) and the variable cost per unit ($6). The profit contribution 
per unit therefore will be $4. The total additional profit contribution from sales 
will be $12,000 (3,000 units * $4 per unit).
Example 15.6 ▶ChAPTER 15   Working Capital and Current Assets Management 671
Cost of the Marginal Investment in Accounts Receivable To determine the cost 
of the marginal investment in accounts receivable, Dodd must find the difference 
between the cost of carrying receivables under the two credit standards. Because 
its concern is only with the out-of-pocket costs, the relevant cost is the variable 
cost. The average investment in accounts receivable can be calculated by using 
the formula
Average investment
in accounts receivable =
Total variable cost of annual sales
Turnover of accounts receivable (15.9)
where
Turnover of accounts receivable =
365
Average collection period
The total variable cost of annual sales under the present and proposed plans can 
be found as follows, using the variable cost per unit of $6.
Total variable cost of annual sales
 Under present plan: ($6 * 60,000 units) = $360,000
 Under proposed plan: ($6 * 63,000 units) = $378,000
The turnover of accounts receivable is the number of times each year that the 
firm’s accounts receivable are actually turned into cash. It is found by dividing 
the average collection period into 365 (the number of days assumed in a year).
Turnover of accounts receivable
 Under present plan: 365
30 = 12.2
 Under proposed plan: 365
45 = 8.1
By substituting the cost and turnover data just calculated into Equation 15.9 
for each case, we get the following average investments in accounts receivable:
Average investment in accounts receivable
 Under present plan: $360,000
12.2 = $29,508
 Under proposed plan: $378,000
8.1 = $46,667
We calculate the marginal investment in accounts receivable and its cost as 
follows:
Cost of marginal investment in accounts receivable
 Average investment under proposed plan $46,667
2 Average investment under present plan 29,508
 Marginal investment in accounts receivable $17,159
 3 Cost of funds tied up in receivables 0.15
 Cost of marginal investment in A/R $ 2,574672 PART 7   Short-Term Financial Decisions
The resulting value of $2,574 is considered a cost because it represents the maxi￾mum amount that could have been earned before taxes on the $17,159 had it 
been placed in an equally risky investment earning 15% before taxes.
Cost of Marginal Bad Debts We find the cost of marginal bad debts by taking 
the difference between the levels of bad debts before and after the proposed relax￾ation of credit standards.
Cost of marginal bad debts
Under proposed plan: (0.02 * $10/unit * 63,000 units) = $12,600
- Under present plan: (0.01 * $10/unit * 60,000 units) = 6,000
Cost of marginal bad debts $ 6,600
Note that the bad-debt costs are calculated by using the sale price per unit 
($10) to deduct not just the true loss of variable cost ($6) that results when a 
customer fails to pay its account but also the profit contribution per unit (in this 
case, $4) that is included in the “additional profit contribution from sales.” Thus, 
the resulting cost of marginal bad debts is $6,600.
Making the Credit Standard Decision  To decide whether to relax its credit 
standards, the firm must compare the additional profit contribution from sales to 
the added costs of the marginal investment in accounts receivable and marginal 
bad debts. If the additional profit contribution is greater than marginal costs, 
credit standards should be relaxed.
The results and key calculations related to Dodd Tool’s decision whether to relax 
its credit standards are summarized in Table 15.2. The net addition to total prof￾its resulting from such an action will be $2,826 per year. Therefore, the firm 
should relax its credit standards as proposed.
The procedure described here for evaluating a proposed change in credit 
standards is also commonly used to evaluate other changes in the management of 
accounts receivable. If Dodd Tool had been contemplating tightening its credit 
standards, for example, the cost would have been a reduction in the profit contri￾bution from sales, and the return would have been from reductions in the cost of 
the investment in accounts receivable and in the cost of bad debts. Another ap￾plication of this procedure is demonstrated later in this chapter.
Managing International Credit
Credit management is difficult enough for managers of purely domestic companies, 
and these tasks become much more complex for companies that operate interna￾tionally. It is partly because (as we have seen before) international operations 
typically expose a firm to exchange rate risk. It is also due to the dangers and 
delays involved in shipping goods long distances and in having to cross interna￾tional borders.
Exports of finished goods are usually priced in the currency of the importer’s 
local market; most commodities, on the other hand, are priced in dollars. There￾fore, a U.S. company that sells a product in Japan, for example, would have to 
Example 15.7 ▶ChAPTER 15   Working Capital and Current Assets Management 673
price that product in Japanese yen and extend credit to a Japanese wholesaler in 
the local currency (yen). If the yen depreciates against the dollar before the U.S. 
exporter collects on its account receivable, the U.S. company experiences an ex￾change rate loss; the yen collected are worth fewer dollars than expected at the 
time the sale was made. Of course, the yen could just as easily appreciate against 
the dollar, yielding an exchange rate gain to the U.S. exporter. Most companies 
fear the loss more than they welcome the gain.
For a major currency such as the Japanese yen, the exporter can hedge against 
this risk by using the currency futures, forward, or options markets, but it is 
costly to do so, particularly for relatively small amounts. If the exporter is selling 
to a customer in a developing country, there will probably be no effective instru￾ment available for protecting against exchange rate risk at any price. This risk 
may be further magnified because credit standards may be much lower (and ac￾ceptable collection techniques much different) in developing countries than in the 
United States. Although it may seem tempting to just “not bother” with export￾ing, U.S. companies no longer can concede foreign markets to international ri￾vals. These export sales, if carefully monitored and (where possible) effectively 
hedged against exchange rate risk, often prove to be very profitable.
CREdIT TERMS
Credit terms are the terms of sale for customers who have been extended credit 
by the firm. Terms of net 30 mean the customer has 30 days from the beginning 
of the credit period (typically end of month or date of invoice) to pay the full in￾voice amount. Some firms offer cash discounts, percentage deductions from the 
purchase price for paying within a specified time. For example, terms of 2/10 net 
30 mean the customer can take a 2 percent discount from the invoice amount if

A firm’s business strongly influences its regular credit terms. For example, 
a firm selling perishable items will have very short credit terms because its 
items have little long-term collateral value; a firm in a seasonal business may 
tailor its terms to fit the industry cycles. A firm wants its regular credit terms 
to conform to its industry’s standards. If its terms are more restrictive than its 
competitors’, it will lose business; if its terms are less restrictive than its com￾petitors’, it will attract poor-quality customers that probably could not pay 
under the standard industry terms. The bottom line is that a firm should com￾pete on the basis of quality and price of its product and service offerings, not 
its credit terms. Accordingly, the firm’s regular credit terms should match the 
industry standards, but individual customer terms should reflect the riskiness 
of the customer.
Cash discount
Including a cash discount in the credit terms is a popular way to speed up collec￾tions without putting pressure on customers. The cash discount provides an incen￾tive for customers to pay sooner. By speeding collections, the discount decreases 
the firm’s investment in accounts receivable, but it also decreases the per-unit 
profit. Additionally, initiating a cash discount should reduce bad debts because 
customers will pay sooner, and it should increase sales volume because customers 
who take the discount pay a lower price for the product. Accordingly, firms that 
consider offering a cash discount must perform a benefit–cost analysis to deter￾mine whether extending a cash discount is profitable.
MAX Company has annual sales of $10 million and an average collection period 
of 40 days (turnover = 365 , 40 = 9.1). In accordance with the firm’s credit 
terms of net 30, this period is divided into 32 days until the customers place their 
payments in the mail (not everyone pays within 30 days) and 8 days to receive, 
process, and collect payments once they are mailed. MAX is considering initiat￾ing a cash discount by changing its credit terms from net 30 to 2/10 net 30. The 
firm expects this change to reduce the amount of time until the payments are 
placed in the mail, resulting in an average collection period of 25 days 
(turnover = 365 , 25 = 14.6).
As noted earlier in Example 15.5, MAX has a raw material with current an￾nual usage of 1,100 units. Each finished product produced requires one unit of 
this raw material at a variable cost of $1,500 per unit, incurs another $800 of 
variable cost in the production process, and sells for $3,000 on terms of net 30. 
Variable costs therefore total $2,300 ($1,500 + $800). MAX estimates that 
80% of its customers will take the 2% discount and that offering the discount 
will increase sales of the finished product by 50 units (from 1,100 to 1,150 units) 
per year but will not alter its bad-debt percentage. MAX’s opportunity cost of 
funds invested in accounts receivable is 14%. Should MAX offer the proposed 
cash discount? An analysis similar to that demonstrated earlier for the credit 
standard decision, presented in Table 15.3, shows a net loss from the cash dis￾count of $6,640. Thus, MAX should not initiate the proposed cash discount.
However, other discounts may be advantageous.
Example 15.8 ▶ChAPTER 15   Working Capital and Current Assets Management 675
Cash discount Period
The financial manager can change the cash discount period, the number of 
days after the beginning of the credit period during which the cash discount is 
available. The net effect of changes in this period is difficult to analyze because 
of the nature of the forces involved. For example, if a firm were to increase its 
cash discount period by 10 days (for example, changing its credit terms from 
2/10 net 30 to 2/20 net 30), the following changes would be expected to occur: 
(1) Sales would increase, positively affecting profit; (2) bad-debt expenses 
would decrease, positively affecting profit; and (3) the profit per unit would 
decrease as a result of more people taking the discount, negatively affecting 
profit.
The difficulty for the financial manager lies in assessing what impact an in￾crease in the cash discount period would have on the firm’s investment in ac￾counts receivable. This investment will decrease because of non–discount takers 
now paying earlier. However, the investment in accounts receivable will increase 
for two reasons: (1) Discount takers will still get the discount but will pay later, 
and (2) new customers attracted by the new policy will result in new accounts 
receivable. If the firm were to decrease the cash discount period, the effects would 
be the opposite of those just described.
Credit Period
Changes in the credit period, the number of days after the beginning of the credit 
period until full payment of the account is due, also affect a firm’s profitability. 
For example, increasing a firm’s credit period from net 30 days to net 45 days 
should increase sales, positively affecting profit. But both the investment

in accounts receivable and bad-debt expenses would also increase, negatively af￾fecting profit. The increased investment in accounts receivable would result from 
both more sales and generally slower pay, on average, as a result of the longer 
credit period. The increase in bad-debt expenses is because the longer the credit 
period, the more time available for a firm to fail, making it unable to pay its ac￾counts payable. A decrease in the length of the credit period is likely to have the 
opposite effects. Note that the variables affected by an increase in the credit pe￾riod behave in the same way they would have if the credit standards had been 
relaxed, as demonstrated earlier in Table 15.2.
CREdIT MONITORING
The final issue a firm should consider in its accounts receivable management is 
credit monitoring. Credit monitoring is an ongoing review of the firm’s accounts 
receivable to determine whether customers are paying according to the stated 
credit terms. If they are not paying in a timely manner, credit monitoring will 
alert the firm to the problem. Slow payments are costly to a firm because they 
lengthen the average collection period and thus increase the firm’s investment in 
accounts receivable. Two frequently used techniques for credit monitoring are 
average collection period and aging of accounts receivable. In addition, a number 
of popular collection techniques are used by firms.
Average Collection Period
The average collection period is the second component of the cash conversion 
cycle. As noted in Chapter 3, it is the average number of days that credit sales are 
outstanding. The average collection period has two components: (1) the time 
from sale until the customer places the payment in the mail and (2) the time to 
receive, process, and collect the payment once it has been mailed by the customer. 
The formula for finding the average collection period is
 Average collection period =
Accounts receivable
Average sales per day (15.10)
Assuming receipt, processing, and collection time is constant, the average collec￾tion period tells the firm, on average, when its customers pay their accounts.
Knowing its average collection period enables the firm to determine 
whether there is a general problem with accounts receivable. For example, a 
firm that has credit terms of net 30 would expect its average collection period 
(minus receipt, processing, and collection time) to equal about 30 days. If the 
actual collection period is significantly greater than 30 days, the firm has rea￾son to review its credit operations. If the firm’s average collection period is 
increasing over time, it has cause for concern about its accounts receivable 
management. A first step in analyzing an accounts receivable problem is to 
“age” the accounts receivable. By this process, the firm can determine whether 
the problem exists in its accounts receivable in general or is attributable to a 
few specific accounts.
Aging of Accounts Receivable
An aging schedule breaks down accounts receivable into groups on the basis of 
their time of origin. The breakdown is typically made on a month-by-month

basis, going back 3 or 4 months. The resulting schedule indicates the percentages 
of the total accounts receivable balance that have been outstanding for specified 
periods of time. The purpose of the aging schedule is to enable the firm to pin￾point problems. A simple example will illustrate the form and evaluation of an 
aging schedule.
The accounts receivable balance on the books of Dodd Tool on December 31, 
2015, was $200,000. The firm extends net 30-day credit terms to its customers. 
To gain insight into the firm’s relatively lengthy—51.3-day—average collection 
period, Dodd prepared the following aging schedule.
Example 15.9 ▶
Age of account Balance outstanding
Percentage of 
total balance outstanding
0–30 days $ 80,000 40%
31–60 days 36,000 18
61–90 days 52,000 26
91–120 days 26,000 13
Over 120 days 6,000 3
 Totals at 12/31/15 $200,000 100%
Because Dodd extends 30-day credit terms to its customers, they have 30 days 
after the end of the month of sale to remit payment. Therefore, the 40% of the 
balance outstanding with an age of 0–30 days is current. The balances out￾standing for 31–60 days, 61–90 days, 91–120 days, and over 120 days are 
overdue.
Reviewing the aging schedule, we see that 40% of the accounts are current 
(age 6 30 days) and the remaining 60% are overdue (age 7 30 days). Eighteen 
percent of the balance outstanding is 1–30 days overdue, 26% is 31–60 days 
overdue, 13% is 61–90 days overdue, and 3% is more than 90 days overdue. 
Although the collections seem generally slow, a noticeable irregularity in these 
data is the high percentage of the balance outstanding that is 31–60 days overdue 
(ages of 61–90 days). Clearly, a problem must have occurred 61–90 days ago. 
Investigation may find that the problem can be attributed to the hiring of a new 
credit manager, the acceptance of a new account that made a large credit pur￾chase but has not yet paid for it, or ineffective collection policy. When this type 
of discrepancy is found in the aging schedule, the analyst should determine, eval￾uate, and remedy its cause.
Popular Collection Techniques
A number of collection techniques, ranging from letters to legal action, are em￾ployed. As an account becomes more and more overdue, the collection effort be￾comes more personal and more intense. In Table 15.4, the popular collection 
techniques are listed and briefly described in the order typically followed in the 
collection process.678 PART 7   Short-Term Financial Decisions

 15.5 Management of Receipts and disbursements
The third component of the cash conversion cycle, the average payment period, 
also has two parts: (1) the time from purchase of goods on account until the firm 
mails its payment and (2) the receipt, processing, and collection time required by 
the firm’s suppliers. The receipt, processing, and collection time for the firm, both 
from its customers and to its suppliers, is the focus of receipts and disbursements 
management.
FLOAT
Float refers to funds that have been sent by the payer but are not yet usable funds 
to the payee. Float is important in the cash conversion cycle because its presence 
lengthens both the firm’s average collection period and its average payment 
Popular Collection Techniques
Techniquea Brief description
Letters After a certain number of days, the firm sends a polite letter reminding the customer of the overdue account. If 
the account is not paid within a certain period after this letter has been sent, a second, more demanding letter 
is sent.
Telephone calls If letters prove unsuccessful, a telephone call may be made to the customer to request immediate payment. If 
the customer has a reasonable excuse, arrangements may be made to extend the payment period. A call from 
the seller’s attorney may be used.
Personal visits This technique is much more common at the consumer credit level, but it may also be effectively employed by 
industrial suppliers. Sending a local salesperson or a collection person to confront the customer can be very ef￾fective. Payment may be made on the spot.
Collection agencies A firm can turn uncollectible accounts over to a collection agency or an attorney for collection. The fees for 
this service are typically quite high; the firm may receive less than 50 cents on the dollar from accounts col￾lected in this way.
Legal action Legal action is the most stringent step, an alternative to the use of a collection agency. Not only is direct legal 
action expensive, but it may force the debtor into bankruptcy without guaranteeing the ultimate receipt of the 
overdue amount.
aThe techniques are listed in the order in which they are typically followed in the collection process.

period. However, the goal of the firm should be to shorten its average collection 
period and lengthen its average payment period. Both can be accomplished by 
managing float.
Float has three component parts:
 1. Mail float is the time delay between when payment is placed in the mail and 
when it is received.
 2. Processing float is the time between receipt of the payment and its deposit 
into the firm’s account.
 3. Clearing float is the time between deposit of the payment and when spend￾able funds become available to the firm. This component of float is attribut￾able to the time required for a check to clear the banking system.
Some popular techniques for managing the component parts of float to speed up 
collections and slow down payments are described here.
SPEEdING uP COLLECTIONS
Speeding up collections reduces customer collection float time and thus reduces 
the firm’s average collection period, which reduces the investment the firm must 
make in its cash conversion cycle. In our earlier examples, MAX Company had 
annual sales of $10 million and 8 days of total collection float (receipt, processing, 
and collection time). If MAX can reduce its float time by 3 days, it will reduce its 
investment in the cash conversion cycle by $82,192 [$10,000,000 * (3 , 365)].
A popular technique for speeding up collections is a lockbox system. A lock￾box system works as follows: Instead of mailing payments to the company, 
customers mail payments to a post office box. The firm’s bank empties the post 
office box regularly, processes each payment, and deposits the payments in the 
firm’s account. Deposit slips, along with payment enclosures, are sent (or trans￾mitted electronically) to the firm by the bank so that the firm can properly credit 
customers’ accounts. Lockboxes are geographically dispersed to match the loca￾tions of the firm’s customers. A lockbox system affects all three components of 
float. Lockboxes reduce mail time and often clearing time by being near the 
firm’s customers. Lockboxes reduce processing time to nearly zero because the 
bank deposits payments before the firm processes them. Obviously, a lockbox 
system reduces collection float time, but not without a cost; therefore, a firm 
must perform an economic analysis to determine whether to implement a lock￾box system.

payment is placed in the mail 
and when it is received.

which customers mail payments 
to a post office box that is 
emptied regularly by the firm’s

payments and deposits them in

speeds up collection time by 
reducing processing time as 
well as mail and clearing time.
Matter of fact
F
or decades, the United State Postal Service has been struggling financially. In 2012, the USPS 
announced that to cut costs it would dramatically reduce the number of mail processing facili￾ties that it operated. For companies, this change meant an increase in mail float. For Fifth Third 
Bank, it was an opportunity. The bank announced a new remote lockbox capture program in 
which business-to-business payments would be retrieved at local post offices around the country. 
Next, Fifth Third would make electronic images of those payments, and the images would be 
processed at the bank’s Cincinnati processing hub. Fifth Third promised customers that it would 
reduce mail float and speed up the collection process for its clients.
U.S.P.S. Problems Create Opportunities for Banks680 PART 7   Short-Term Financial Decisions
Lockbox systems are commonly used by large firms whose customers are 
geographically dispersed. However, a firm does not have to be large to benefit 
from a lockbox. Smaller firms can also benefit from a lockbox system. The ben￾efit to small firms often comes primarily from transferring the processing of pay￾ments to the bank.
SLOWING dOWN PAYMENTS
Float is also a component of the firm’s average payment period. In this case, the 
float is in the favor of the firm. The firm may benefit by increasing all three of the 
components of its payment float. One popular technique for increasing payment 
float is controlled disbursing, which involves the strategic use of mailing points 
and bank accounts to lengthen mail float and clearing float, respectively. Firms 
must use this approach carefully, though, because longer payment periods may 
strain supplier relations.

slowing down payments through controlled disbursing and other methods, a

Stretching payables 
has often been consid￾ered good cash management. By de￾laying bill payments as long as possible 
without damaging the firm’s credit, com￾panies get interest-free loans from sup￾pliers. Some businesses deliberately in￾crease their accounts payable lag to 
cover temporary cash shortages.
There are two negative ramifica￾tions of stretching accounts payables 
(A/P). First, the stretching out of pay￾ables can be pushed too far, and a 
business can get tagged as a slow 
payer. Vendors will eventually put 
increasing pressure on the company to 
make more timely payments.
Stretching accounts payables also 
raises ethical issues. First, it may cause 
the firm to violate the agreement it 
entered with its supplier when it pur￾chased the merchandise. More impor￾tant to investors, the firm may stretch 
A/P to artificially boost reported oper￾ating cash flow during a reporting 
period. In other words, firms can 
improve reported operating cash flows 
due solely to a decision to slow the 
payment rate to vendors. Unfortunately 
for investors, the improvement in oper￾ating cash flows may be unsustainable 
if vendors force the company to 
improve its payment record; at a mini￾mum, any year-over-year improvement 
in operating cash flow may be unsus￾tainable.
The extension of payables can be 
identified by monitoring days sales pay￾ables (DSP), calculated as the end-of￾period accounts payable balance 
divided by the cost of goods sold and 
multiplied by the number of days in the 
period. As DSP grows, operating cash 
flows are boosted.
A more complicated version of 
stretching payables is the financing of 
payables, which occurs when a com￾pany uses a third-party financial institu￾tion to pay the vendor in the current 
period and pays back the bank in a 
subsequent period. This approach 
reclassifies the amount from accounts 
payable to short-term loans. The reclas￾sification results in a decrease to operat￾ing cash flow in that quarter and an 
increase in financing cash flow. 
Normally, cash expenditures for 
accounts payable are included in oper￾ating activities. Because the timing and 
extent of vendor financing is at the dis￾cretion of company management, the 
temptation to manipulate operating cash 
flows may prove too great for some.
Setting aside the ethical ramifica￾tions of stretching accounts payable, 
there may be financial incentives for 
avoiding the practice. Companies that 
can move to an automated A/P system 
may be able to take advantage of ben￾eficial early payment discounts that pro￾vide a far better risk-free rate of return 
than stretching out accounts payable. 
For example, a 2/10 net 30 discount 
equates to about a 36 percent annual￾ized return. Viewed this way, an A/P 
balance may be the most expensive 
debt on the balance sheet.

early payment are very rewarding, 
what are some of the difficulties that 
may arise to keep a firm from taking 
advantage of those discounts?

technique known collectively as stretching accounts payable. This is a topic we 
will come back to in Chapter 16.
In summary, a reasonable overall policy for float management is (1) to collect 
payments as quickly as possible because once the payment is in the mail the funds 
belong to the firm and (2) to delay making payment to suppliers because once the 
payment is mailed the funds belong to the supplier.
CASh CONCENTRATION
Cash concentration is the process used by the firm to bring lockbox and other 
deposits together into one bank, often called the concentration bank. Cash con￾centration has three main advantages. First, it creates a large pool of funds for 
use in making short-term cash investments. Because there is a fixed-cost compo￾nent in the transaction cost associated with such investments, investing a single 
pool of funds reduces the firm’s transaction costs. The larger investment pool 
also allows the firm to choose from a greater variety of short-term investment 
vehicles. Second, concentrating the firm’s cash in one account improves the track￾ing and internal control of the firm’s cash. Third, having one concentration bank 
enables the firm to implement payment strategies that reduce idle cash balances.
There are a variety of mechanisms for transferring cash from the lockbox 
bank and other collecting banks to the concentration bank. One mechanism is a 
depository transfer check (DTC), which is an unsigned check drawn on one of 
the firm’s bank accounts and deposited in another. For cash concentration, a 
DTC is drawn on each lockbox or other collecting bank account and deposited in 
the concentration bank account. Once the DTC has cleared the bank on which it 
is drawn (which may take several days), the transfer of funds is completed. Most 
firms currently provide deposit information by telephone to the concentration 
bank, which then prepares and deposits into its account the DTC drawn on the 
lockbox or other collecting bank account.
A second mechanism is an ACH (automated clearinghouse) transfer, which is 
a preauthorized electronic withdrawal from the payer’s account. A computerized 
clearing facility (called the automated clearinghouse, or ACH) makes a paperless 
transfer of funds between the payer and payee banks. An ACH settles accounts 
among participating banks. Individual accounts are settled by respective bank 
balance adjustments. ACH transfers clear in 1 day. For cash concentration, an 
ACH transfer is made from each lockbox bank or other collecting bank to the 
concentration bank. An ACH transfer can be thought of as an electronic DTC, 
but because the ACH transfer clears in 1 day, it provides benefits over a DTC; 
however, both banks in the ACH transfer must be members of the clearinghouse.
A third cash concentration mechanism is a wire transfer. A wire transfer is an 
electronic communication that, via bookkeeping entries, removes funds from the 
payer’s bank and deposits them in the payee’s bank. Wire transfers can eliminate 
mail and clearing float and may reduce processing float as well. For cash concen￾tration, the firm moves funds using a wire transfer from each lockbox or other 
collecting account to its concentration account. Wire transfers are a substitute for 
DTC and ACH transfers, but they are more expensive.
It is clear that the firm must balance the costs and benefits of concentrating 
cash to determine the type and timing of transfers from its lockbox and other col￾lecting accounts to its concentration account. The transfer mechanism selected 
should be the one that is most profitable. (The profit per period of any transfer

of the transfer system.)
ZERO-BALANCE ACCOuNTS
Zero-balance accounts (ZBAs) are disbursement accounts that always have an 
end-of-day balance of zero. The purpose is to eliminate nonearning cash balances 
in corporate checking accounts. A ZBA works well as a disbursement account 
under a cash concentration system.
ZBAs work as follows: Once all a given day’s checks are presented for payment 
from the firm’s ZBA, the bank notifies the firm of the total amount of checks, and 
the firm transfers funds into the account to cover the amount of that day’s checks. 
This transfer leaves an end-of-day balance of $0 (zero dollars). The ZBA enables 
the firm to keep all its operating cash in an interest-earning account, thereby elimi￾nating idle cash balances. Thus, a firm that used a ZBA in conjunction with a cash 
concentration system would need two accounts. The firm would concentrate its 
cash from the lockboxes and other collecting banks into an interest-earning ac￾count and would write checks against its ZBA. The firm would cover the exact 
dollar amount of checks presented against the ZBA with transfers from the interest￾earning account, leaving the end-of-day balance in the ZBA at $0.
A ZBA is a disbursement-management tool. As we discussed earlier, the firm 
would prefer to maximize its payment float. However, some cash managers be￾lieve that actively attempting to increase float time on payments is unethical. A 
ZBA enables the firm to maximize the use of float on each check without altering 
the float time of payments to its suppliers. Keeping all the firm’s cash in an interest￾earning account enables the firm to maximize earnings on its cash balances by 
capturing the full float time on each check it writes.
Megan Laurie, a 25-year-old nurse, works at a hospital that 
pays her every 2 weeks by direct deposit into her checking ac￾count, which pays no interest and has no minimum balance requirement. She 
takes home about $1,800 every 2 weeks, or about $3,600 per month. She main￾tains a checking account balance of around $1,500. Whenever it exceeds that 
amount, she transfers the excess into her savings account, which currently pays 
1.5% annual interest. She currently has a savings account balance of $17,000 
and estimates that she transfers about $600 per month from her checking ac￾count into her savings account.
Megan pays her bills immediately when she receives them. Her monthly bills 
average about $1,900, and her monthly cash outlays for food and gas total about 
$900. An analysis of Megan’s bill payments indicates that on average she pays 
her bills 8 days early. Most marketable securities are currently yielding about 
4.2% annual interest. Megan is interested in learning how she might better man￾age her cash balances.
Megan talks with her sister, who has had a finance course, and they come up 
with three ways for Megan to better manage her cash balance:
 1. Invest current balances. Megan can transfer her current savings account bal￾ances into a liquid marketable security, thereby increasing the rate of interest 
earned from 1.5% to about 4.2%. On her current $17,000 balance, she will 
immediately increase her annual interest earnings by about $460 
[(0.042 - 0.015) * $17,000].

 2. Invest monthly surpluses. Megan can transfer monthly the $600 from her 
checking account to the liquid marketable security, thereby increasing the annual 
earnings on each monthly transfer by about $16 [(0.042 - 0.015) * $600], 
which for the 12 transfers would generate additional annual earnings of about 
$192 (12 months * $16).
 3. Slow down payments. Rather than paying her bills immediately on receipt, 
Megan can pay her bills nearer their due date. By doing so, she can gain 8 days 
of disbursement float each month, or 96 days per year (8 days per month * 12 
months), on an average of $1,900 of bills. Assuming that she can earn 4.2% 
annual interest on the $1,900, slowing down her payments would save about 
$21 annually [(96 , 365) * 0.042 * $1,900].
Based on these three recommendations, Megan would increase her annual 
earnings by a total of about $673 ( $460 + $192 + $21). Clearly, Megan can 
grow her earnings by better managing her cash balances.
INVESTING IN MARKETABLE SECuRITIES
Marketable securities are short-term, interest-earning, money market instruments 
that can easily be converted into cash. Marketable securities are classified as part 
of the firm’s liquid assets. The firm uses them to earn a return on temporarily idle 
funds. To be truly marketable, a security must have (1) a ready market so as to 
minimize the amount of time required to convert it into cash and (2) safety of 
principal, which means that it experiences little or no loss in value over time.
The securities that are most commonly held as part of the firm’s marketable￾securities portfolio are divided into two groups: (1) government issues, which 
have relatively low yields as a consequence of their low risk; and (2) nongovern￾ment issues, which have slightly higher yields than government issues with similar 
maturities because of the slightly higher risk associated with them. Table 15.5 
summarizes the key features for popular marketable securities.

Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
It is important for a firm to maintain a reasonable level of net working capital. 
To do so, it must balance the high profit and high risk associated with low levels 
of current assets and high levels of current liabilities against the low profit and 
low risk that result from high levels of current assets and low levels of current li￾abilities. A strategy that achieves a reasonable balance between profits and risk 
should positively contribute to the firm’s value.
Similarly, the firm should manage its cash conversion cycle by turning in￾ventory quickly; collecting accounts receivable quickly; managing mail, process￾ing, and clearing time; and paying accounts payable slowly. These strategies ChAPTER 15   Working Capital and Current Assets Management 685
should enable the firm to manage its current accounts efficiently and to mini￾mize the amount of resources invested in operating assets.
The financial manager can manage inventory, accounts receivable, and cash 
receipts to minimize the firm’s operating cycle investment, thereby reducing the 
amount of resources needed to support its business. Employing these strategies, 
and managing accounts payable and cash disbursements so as to shorten the 
cash conversion cycle, should minimize the negotiated liabilities needed to sup￾port the firm’s resource requirements. Active management of the firm’s net 
working capital and current assets should positively contribute to the firm’s goal 
of maximizing its stock price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
LG 1 Understand working capital management, net working capital, and the re￾lated trade-off between profitability and risk. Working capital (or short-term fi￾nancial) management focuses on managing each of the firm’s current assets (in￾ventory, accounts receivable, cash, and marketable securities) and current 
liabilities (accounts payable, accruals, and notes payable) in a manner that posi￾tively contributes to the firm’s value. Net working capital is the difference be￾tween current assets and current liabilities. Risk, in the context of short-term fi￾nancial decisions, is the probability that a firm will be unable to pay its bills as 
they come due. Assuming a constant level of total assets, the higher a firm’s ratio 
of current assets to total assets, the less profitable the firm and the less risky it is. 
The converse is also true. With constant total assets, the higher a firm’s ratio of 
current liabilities to total assets, the more profitable and the more risky the firm 
is. The converse of this statement is also true.
LG 2 Describe the cash conversion cycle, its funding requirements, and the key 
strategies for managing it. The cash conversion cycle has three components: 
(1) average age of inventory, (2) average collection period, and (3) average pay￾ment period. The length of the cash conversion cycle determines the amount of 
time resources are tied up in the firm’s day-to-day operations. The firm’s invest￾ment in short-term assets often consists of both permanent and seasonal funding 
requirements. The seasonal requirements can be financed using either an aggres￾sive (low-cost, high-risk) financing strategy or a conservative (high-cost, low￾risk) financing strategy. The firm’s funding decision for its cash conversion cycle 
ultimately depends on management’s disposition toward risk and the strength of 
the firm’s banking relationships. To minimize its reliance on negotiated liabilities, 
the financial manager seeks to (1) turn over inventory as quickly as possible; 
(2) collect accounts receivable as quickly as possible; (3) manage mail, process￾ing, and clearing time; and (4) pay accounts payable as slowly as possible. Use 
of these strategies should minimize the length of the cash conversion cycle.
LG 3 Discuss inventory management: differing views, common techniques, and 
international concerns. The viewpoints of marketing, manufacturing, and pur￾chasing managers about the appropriate levels of inventory tend to cause higher 
inventories than those deemed appropriate by the financial manager. Four com￾monly used techniques for effectively managing inventory to keep its level low 
are (1) the ABC system, (2) the economic order quantity (EOQ) model, (3) the 
just-in-time (JIT) system, and (4) computerized systems for resource control: 686 PART 7   Short-Term Financial Decisions
MRP, MRP II, and ERP. International inventory managers place greater empha￾sis on making sure that sufficient quantities of inventory are delivered where 
and when needed, and in the right condition, than on ordering the economically 
optimal quantities.
LG 4 Explain the credit selection process and the quantitative procedure for 
evaluating changes in credit standards. Credit selection techniques determine 
which customers’ creditworthiness is consistent with the firm’s credit standards. 
Two popular credit selection techniques are the five C’s of credit and credit scor￾ing. Changes in credit standards can be evaluated mathematically by assessing 
the effects of a proposed change on profits from sales, the cost of accounts re￾ceivable investment, and bad-debt costs.
LG 5 Review the procedures for quantitatively considering cash discount 
changes, other aspects of credit terms, and credit monitoring. Changes in credit 
terms—the cash discount, the cash discount period, and the credit period—can 
be quantified similarly to changes in credit standards. Credit monitoring, the on￾going review of accounts receivable, frequently involves use of the average col￾lection period and an aging schedule. Firms use a number of popular collection 
techniques.
LG 6 Understand the management of receipts and disbursements, including 
float, speeding up collections, slowing down payments, cash concentration, zero￾balance accounts, and investing in marketable securities. Float refers to funds 
that have been sent by the payer but are not yet usable funds to the payee. The 
components of float are mail time, processing time, and clearing time. Float oc￾curs in both the average collection period and the average payment period. One 
technique for speeding up collections is a lockbox system. A popular technique 
for slowing payments is controlled disbursing.
The goal for managing operating cash is to balance the opportunity cost 
of nonearning balances against the transaction cost of temporary investments. 
Firms commonly use depository transfer checks (DTCs), ACH transfers, and 
wire transfers to transfer lockbox receipts to their concentration banks 
quickly. Zero-balance accounts (ZBAs) can be used to eliminate nonearning 
cash balances in corporate checking accounts. Marketable securities are short￾term, interest-earning, money market instruments used by the firm to earn a 
return on temporarily idle funds. They may be government or nongovernment 
issues.
Opener-in-Review
In the chapter opener, you learned that U.S. companies had been building up 
their cash balances after the financial crisis, even though the interest rates 
that they could earn on low-risk, liquid investments were extremely low. De￾scribe the trade-off that companies face when they are deciding how much 
cash to hold.ChAPTER 15   Working Capital and Current Assets Management 687
Self-Test Problems  (Solutions in Appendix)
 ST15–1 Cash conversion cycle Hurkin Manufacturing Company pays accounts payable on 
the tenth day after purchase. The average collection period is 30 days, and the 
average age of inventory is 40 days. The firm currently has annual sales of about 
$18 million and purchases of $14 million. The firm is considering a plan that 
would stretch its accounts payable by 20 days. If the firm pays 12% per year for its 
resource investment, what annual savings can it realize by this plan? Assume a 
360-day year.
 ST15–2 EOQ analysis Thompson Paint Company uses 60,000 gallons of pigment per year. 
The cost of ordering pigment is $200 per order, and the cost of carrying the pigment 
in inventory is $1 per gallon per year. The firm uses pigment at a constant rate every 
day throughout the year.
a. Calculate the EOQ.
b. Assuming that it takes 20 days to receive an order once it has been placed, deter￾mine the reorder point in terms of gallons of pigment. (Note: Use a 365-day 
year.)
 ST15–3 Relaxing credit standards Regency Rug Repair Company is trying to decide whether 
it should relax its credit standards. The firm repairs 72,000 rugs per year at an aver￾age price of $32 each. Bad-debt expenses are 1% of sales, the average collection pe￾riod is 40 days, and the variable cost per unit is $28. Regency expects that if it does 
relax its credit standards, the average collection period will increase to 48 days and 
that bad debts will increase to 11
/2% of sales. Sales will increase by 4,000 repairs per 
year. If the firm has a required rate of return on equal-risk investments of 14%, 
what recommendation would you give the firm? Use your analysis to justify your 
answer. (Note: Use a 365-day year.)

 E15–4 Forrester Fashions has annual credit sales of 250,000 units with an average collection 
period of 70 days. The company has a per-unit variable cost of $20 and a per-unit sale 
price of $30. Bad debts currently are 5% of sales. The firm estimates that a proposed 
relaxation of credit standards would not affect its 70-day average collection period but 
would increase bad debts to 7.5% of sales, which would increase to 300,000 units per 
year. Forrester requires a 12% return on investments. Show all necessary calculations 
required to evaluate Forrester’s proposed relaxation of credit standards.
 E15–5 Klein’s Tools is considering offering a cash discount to speed up the collection of

annual sales are 35,000 units, the per-unit price is $40, and the per-unit variable 
cost is $29. A 2% cash discount is being considered. Klein’s Tools estimates that 
80% of its customers will take the 2% discount. If sales are expected to rise to 
37,000 units per year and the firm has a 15% required rate of return, what mini￾mum average collection period is required to approve the cash discount plan?

 Personal Finance Problem
 P15–7 Marginal costs Jimmy Johnson is interested in buying a new Jeep SUV. There are 
two options available, a V-6 model and a V-8 model. Whichever model he chooses, 
he plans to drive it for a period of 5 years and then sell it. Assume that the trade-in

estimates that she transfers about $500 per month from her checking account into 
her savings account. Alexis doesn’t waste any time in paying her bills, and her 
monthly bills average about $2,000. Her monthly cash outlay for food, gas, and 
other sundry items totals about $850. Reviewing her payment habits indicates that 
on average she pays her bills 9 days early. At this time, most marketable securities

Spreadsheet Exercise
 The current balance in accounts receivable for Eboy Corporation is $443,000. This 
level was achieved with annual (365 days) credit sales of $3,544,000. The firm offers 
its customers credit terms of net 30. However, in an effort to help its cash flow posi￾tion and to follow the actions of its rivals, the firm is considering changing its credit 
terms from net 30 to 2/10 net 30. The objective is to speed up the receivable collec￾tions and thereby improve the firm’s cash flows. Eboy would like to increase its ac￾counts receivable turnover to 12.0.
The firm works with a raw material whose current annual usage is 1,450 
units. Each finished product requires one unit of this raw material at a variable 
cost of $2,600 per unit and sells for $4,200 on terms of net 30. It is estimated 
that 70% of the firm’s customers will take the 2% cash discount and that, with 
the discount, sales of the finished product will increase by 50 units per year. The 
firm’s opportunity cost of funds invested in accounts receivable is 12.5%.
In analyzing the investment in accounts receivable, use the variable cost of 
the product sold instead of the sale price because the variable cost is a better in￾dicator of the firm’s investment.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
Accounting You need to understand how to analyze supplier credit terms to 
decide whether the firm should take or give up cash discounts; you also need to 
understand the various types of short-term loans, both unsecured and secured, 
that you will be required to record and report.
informAtion SYStemS You need to understand what data the firm will need 
to process accounts payable, track accruals, and meet bank loans and other 
short-term debt obligations in a timely manner.
mAnAgement You need to know the sources of short-term loans so that, if 
short-term financing is needed, you will understand its availability and cost.
mArketing You need to understand how accounts receivable and inventory 
can be used as loan collateral; the procedures used by the firm to secure short￾term loans with such collateral could affect customer relationships.
operAtionS You need to understand the use of accounts payable as a form of 
short-term financing and the effect on one’s suppliers of stretching payables; you 
also need to understand the process by which a firm uses inventory as collateral.
In your personal life management of current liabilities is an impor￾tant part of your financial strategy. it takes 
discipline to avoid viewing cash and credit purchases equally. You need to borrow 
for a purpose, not convenience. You need to repay credit purchases in a timely 
fashion. excessive use of short-term credit, particularly with credit cards, can cre￾ate personal liquidity problems and, at the extreme, personal bankruptcy.

igital advertising revenues hit $36.6 billion 
in 2012, a 15 percent increase over 
2011, which was itself a record-breaking year. 
Online ads are everywhere, from Google search 
pages to YouTube videos to your Facebook News 
Feed. A challenge for the publishers of online ads 
is collecting money for those ads. The industry 
standard calls for publishers of online ads to send 
invoices within 30 days after an ad campaign is 
complete, and the advertiser then has 30 days or 
more to pay for the ad. Thus, companies that sell online advertising can accumulate large receiv￾ables balances, and collecting cash can be a slow process.
That’s where the company FastPay comes in. FastPay makes loans to publishers, ad-tech 
companies, and other digital media businesses based on those firms’ accounts receivable. 
FastPay lends up to $5 million per borrower, with the terms of the loan based on the quality of 
the receivable. For example, if Pepsi were to enter into an agreement with YouTube to place 
online ads in videos, FastPay would grant a loan to YouTube on relatively favorable terms 
because it views Pepsi as a good credit risk. One area in which FastPay is expanding rapidly is 
in making loans to Facebook Preferred Marketing Developers, a network of small and medium￾sized businesses that builds advertising apps on Facebook, manages ad campaigns, and helps 
Facebook develop new marketing strategies.
Firms rely on a wide array of short-term financing vehicles. In this chapter, you’ll learn about 
the ways companies can use short-term finance to help maximize the wealth of their shareholders.

 16.1 Spontaneous Liabilities
Spontaneous liabilities arise from the normal course of business. For example, 
when a retailer orders goods for inventory, the manufacturer of those goods usu￾ally does not demand immediate payment but instead extends a short-term loan 
to the retailer that appears on the retailer’s balance sheet under accounts payable. 
The more goods the retailer orders, the greater will be the accounts payable bal￾ance. Also in response to increasing sales, the firm’s accruals increase as wages 
and taxes rise because of greater labor requirements and the increased taxes on 
the firm’s increased earnings. There is normally no explicit cost attached to either 
of these current liabilities, although they do have certain implicit costs. In addi￾tion, both are forms of unsecured short-term financing, short-term financing 
obtained without pledging specific assets as collateral. The firm should take 
advantage of these “interest-free” sources of unsecured short-term financing 
whenever possible.
ACCOuNTS PAYABLE MANAGEMENT
Accounts payable are the major source of unsecured short-term financing for 
business firms. They result from transactions in which merchandise is pur￾chased but no formal note is signed to show the purchaser’s liability to the 
seller. The purchaser in effect agrees to pay the supplier the amount required 
in accordance with credit terms normally stated on the supplier’s invoice. The 
discussion of accounts payable here is presented from the viewpoint of the 
purchaser.
Role in the Cash Conversion Cycle
The average payment period is the final component of the cash conversion cycle
introduced in Chapter 15. The average payment period has two parts: (1) the 
time from the purchase of raw materials until the firm mails the payment and 
(2) payment float time (the time it takes after the firm mails its payment until 
the supplier has withdrawn spendable funds from the firm’s account). In Chap￾ter 15, we discussed issues related to payment float time. Here we discuss the 
firm’s management of the time that elapses between its purchase of raw materi￾als and its mailing payment to the supplier. This activity is accounts payable 
management.
When the seller of goods charges no interest and offers no discount to the 
buyer for early payment, the buyer’s goal is to pay as slowly as possible without 
damaging its credit rating. In other words, accounts should be paid on the last 
day possible, given the supplier’s stated credit terms. For example, if the terms are 
net 30, the account should be paid 30 days from the beginning of the credit pe￾riod, which is typically either the date of invoice or the end of the month (EOM)
in which the purchase was made. This timing allows for the maximum use of an 
interest-free loan from the supplier and will not damage the firm’s credit rating 
(because the account is paid within the stated credit terms). In addition, some 
firms offer an explicit or implicit “grace period” that extends a few days beyond 
the stated payment date; if taking advantage of that grace period does no harm to 
the buyer’s relationship with the seller, the buyer will typically take advantage of 
the grace period.

In 2013, Brown-Forman Corporation (BF), manufacturer of alcoholic beverage 
brands such as Jack Daniels, had annual revenue of $3.8 billion, cost of revenue 
of $1.8 billion, and accounts payable of $468 million. BF had an average age of 
inventory (AAI) of 168 days, an average collection period (ACP) of 55 days, and 
an average payment period (APP) of 136 days (BF’s purchases were $1.3 billion). 
Thus, the cash conversion cycle for BF was 87 days (168 + 55 - 136).
The resources BF had invested in this cash conversion cycle (assuming a 365-
day year) were
Inventory 5 $ 1.8 billion 3 (168 4 365) 5 $0. 83 billion
1 Accounts receivable 5 3.8 billion 3 (55 4 365) 5 0.57 billion
2 Accounts payable 5 1.3 billion 3 (136 4 365) 5 0.48 billion
5 Resources invested 5 $ 0.92 billion
Based on BF’s APP and average accounts payable, the daily accounts payable 
generated by BF is about $3.5 million ($0.48 billion , 136). If BF were to in￾crease its average payment period by 5 days, its accounts payable would increase 
by about $17.5 million (5 * $3.5 million). As a result, BF’s cash conversion cycle 
would decrease by 5 days, and the firm would reduce its investment in operations 
by $17.5 million. Clearly, if this action did not damage BF’s credit rating, it 
would be in the company’s best interest.
Analyzing Credit Terms
The credit terms that a firm is offered by its suppliers enable it to delay payments 
for its purchases. Because the supplier’s cost of having its money tied up in mer￾chandise after it is sold is probably reflected in the purchase price, the purchaser 
is already indirectly paying for this benefit. Sometimes a supplier will offer a cash 
discount for early payment. In that case, the purchaser should carefully analyze 
credit terms to determine the best time to repay the supplier. The purchaser must 
weigh the benefits of paying the supplier as late as possible against the costs of 
passing up the discount for early payment.
Taking the Cash Discount If a firm intends to take a cash discount, it 
should pay on the last day of the discount period. There is no added benefit from 
paying earlier than that date.
Lawrence Industries, operator of a small chain of video stores, purchased $1,000 
worth of merchandise on February 27 from a supplier extending terms of 2/10 
net 30 EOM. If the firm takes the cash discount, it must pay $980 
[$1,000 - (0.02 * $1,000)] by March 10, thereby saving $20.
Giving Up the Cash Discount If the firm chooses to give up the cash discount, 
it should pay on the final day of the credit period. There is an implicit cost associ￾ated with giving up a cash discount. The cost of giving up a cash discount is the 
implied rate of interest paid to delay payment of an account payable for an addi￾tional number of days. In other words, when a firm gives up a discount, it pays a

discount

paid to delay payment of an 
account payable for an

higher cost for the goods that it orders. The higher cost that the firm pays is like in￾terest on a loan, and the length of this loan is the number of additional days that the 
purchaser can delay payment to the seller. This cost can be illustrated by a simple 
example. The example assumes that payment will be made on the last possible day 
(either the final day of the cash discount period or the final day of the credit period).
In Example 16.2, we saw that Lawrence Industries could take the cash discount 
on its February 27 purchase by paying $980 on March 10. If Lawrence gives up 
the cash discount, it can pay on March 30. To keep its money for an extra 
20 days, the firm must pay an extra $20, or $1,000 rather than $980. In other 
words, if the firm pays on March 30, it will pay $980 (what it could have paid on 
March 10) plus $20. The extra $20 is like interest on a loan, and in this case the 
$980 is like the loan principal. Lawrence Industries owes $980 to its supplier on 
March 10, but the supplier is willing to accept $980 plus $20 in interest on March 
30. Figure 16.1 shows the payment options that are open to the company.
To calculate the implied interest rate associated with giving up the cash dis￾count, we simply treat $980 as the loan principal, $20 as the interest, and 20 days 
(the time from March 10 to March 30) as the term of the loan. Again, the trade￾off that Lawrence faces is that it can pay $980 on March 10 or $980 plus $20 in 
interest 20 days later on March 30. Therefore, the interest rate that Lawrence is 
paying by giving up the discount is 2.04% ($20 , $980). Keep in mind that the 
2.04% interest rate applies to a 20-day loan. To calculate an annualized interest 
rate, we multiply the interest rate on this transaction times the number of 20-day 
periods during a year. The general expression for calculating the annual percent￾age cost of giving up a cash discount can be expressed as1

1. Equation 16.1 and the related discussions are based on the assumption that only one discount is offered. In the 
event that multiple discounts are offered, calculation of the cost of giving up the discount must be made for each 
alternative.

where
CD = stated cash discount in percentage terms
N = number of days that payment can
be delayed by giving up the cash discount
Substituting the values for CD (2%) and N (20 days) into Equation 16.1 results 
in an annualized cost of giving up the cash discount of 37.24% 
[(2, , 98,) * (365 , 20)].
A simple way to approximate the cost of giving up a cash discount is to use the 
stated cash discount percentage, CD, in place of the first term of Equation 16.1:
 Approximate cost of giving up cash discount = CD *
365
N
(16.2)
The smaller the cash discount, the closer the approximation to the actual cost of 
giving it up. Using this approximation, the cost of giving up the cash discount for 
Lawrence Industries is 36.5% [2, * (365 , 20)].
Using the Cost of Giving Up a Cash Discount in Decision Making The finan￾cial manager must determine whether it is advisable to take a cash discount. A pri￾mary consideration influencing this decision is the cost of other short-term sources 
of funding. When a firm can obtain financing from a bank or other institution at a 
lower cost than the implicit interest rate offered by its suppliers, the firm is better 
off borrowing from the bank and taking the discount offered by the supplier.
Mason Products, a large building-supply company, has four possible suppliers, 
each offering different credit terms. Otherwise, their products and services are 
identical. Table 16.1 presents the credit terms offered by suppliers A, B, C, and D 
and the cost of giving up the cash discounts in each transaction. The approxima￾tion method of calculating the cost of giving up a cash discount (Equation 16.2) 
has been used. The cost of giving up the cash discount from supplier A is 36.5%; 
from supplier B, 4.9%; from supplier C, 21.9%; and from supplier D, 29.2%.
If the firm needs short-term funds, which it can borrow from its bank at an 
interest rate of 6%, and if each of the suppliers is viewed separately, which (if 
any) of the suppliers’ cash discounts will the firm give up? In dealing with sup￾plier A, the firm takes the cash discount, because the cost of giving it up is 36.5%, 
and then borrows the funds it requires from its bank at 6% interest. With 
Example 16.4 ▶

A 2/10 net 30 EOM 36.5%

C 3/20 net 70 EOM 21.9
D 4/10 net 60 EOM 29.2ChAPTER 16   Current Liabilities Management 701
supplier B, the firm would do better to give up the cash discount, because the cost 
of this action is less than the cost of borrowing money from the bank (4.9% ver￾sus 6%). With either supplier C or supplier D, the firm should take the cash dis￾count, because in both cases the cost of giving up the discount is greater than the 
6% cost of borrowing from the bank.
The example shows that the cost of giving up a cash discount is relevant 
when one is evaluating a single supplier’s credit terms in light of certain bank 
borrowing costs. However, other factors relative to payment strategies may also 
need to be considered. For example, some firms, particularly small firms and 
poorly managed firms, routinely give up all discounts because they either lack 
alternative sources of unsecured short-term financing or fail to recognize the im￾plicit costs of their actions.
Effects of Stretching Accounts Payable
A strategy that is often employed by a firm is stretching accounts payable, that is, 
paying bills as late as possible without damaging its credit rating. Such a strategy 
can reduce the cost of giving up a cash discount.
Lawrence Industries was extended credit terms of 2/10 net 30 EOM. The cost of 
giving up the cash discount, assuming payment on the last day of the credit pe￾riod, was approximately 36.5% [2, * (365 , 20)]. If the firm were able to 
stretch its account payable to 70 days without damaging its credit rating, the cost 
of giving up the cash discount would be only 12.2% [2, * (365 , 60)]. Stretch￾ing accounts payable reduces the implicit cost of giving up a cash discount.
Although stretching accounts payable may be financially attractive, it raises 
an important ethical issue: It may cause the firm to violate the agreement it en￾tered into with its supplier when it purchased merchandise. Clearly, a supplier 
would not look kindly on a customer who regularly and purposely postponed 
paying for purchases.
Jack and Mary Nobel, a young married couple, are in the pro￾cess of purchasing a 50-inch HD TV at a cost of $1,900. The 
electronics dealer currently has a special financing plan that would allow them to 
either (1) put $200 down and finance the balance of $1,700 at 3% annual interest 
over 24 months, resulting in payments of $73 per month; or (2) receive an immedi￾ate $150 cash rebate, thereby paying only $1,750 cash. The Nobels, who have saved 
enough to pay cash for the TV, can currently earn 5% annual interest on their sav￾ings. They wish to determine whether to borrow or to pay cash to purchase the TV.
The upfront outlay for the financing alternative is the $200 down payment, 
whereas the Nobels will pay out $1,750 up front under the cash purchase alterna￾tive. So, the cash purchase will require an initial outlay that is $1,550 ($1,750 2
$200) greater than under the financing alternative. Assuming that they can earn a 
simple interest rate of 5% on savings, the cash purchase will cause the Nobels to 
give up an opportunity to earn $155 (2 years * 0.05 * $1,550) over the 2 years.
If they choose the financing alternative, the $1,550 would grow to $1,705 
($1,550 + $155) at the end of 2 years. But under the financing alternative, the

without damaging the firm’s 
credit rating.702 PART 7   Short-Term Financial Decisions
Nobels will pay out a total of $1,752 (24 months * $73 per month) over the 
2-year loan term. The cost of the financing alternative can be viewed as $1,752, 
and the cost of the cash payment (including forgone interest earnings) would be 
$1,705. Because it is less expensive, the Nobels should pay cash for the TV. The 
lower cost of the cash alternative is largely the result of the $150 cash rebate.
ACCRuALS
The second spontaneous source of short-term business financing is accruals. 
Accruals are liabilities for services received for which payment has yet to be made. 
The most common items accrued by a firm are wages and taxes. Because taxes 
are payments to the government, their accrual cannot be manipulated by the 
firm. However, the accrual of wages can be manipulated to some extent by delay￾ing payment of wages, thereby receiving an interest-free loan from employees 
who are paid sometime after they have performed the work. The pay period for 
employees who earn an hourly rate is often governed by union regulations or by 
state or federal law. However, in other cases, the frequency of payment is at the 
discretion of the company’s management.

On June 2, 2010, 
Diebold, Inc., agreed 
to pay a $25 million fine to settle ac￾counting fraud charges brought by the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commis￾sion (SEC). According to the SEC, the 
management of the Ohio-based manu￾facturer of ATMs, bank security systems, 
and electronic voting machines regu￾larly received reports comparing the 
company’s earnings to analyst fore￾casts. When earnings were below fore￾casts, management identified opportuni￾ties, some of which amounted to 
accounting fraud, to close the gap.
“Diebold’s financial executives bor￾rowed from many different chapters of 
the deceptive accounting playbook to 
fraudulently boost the company’s bottom 
line,” SEC Enforcement Director Robert 
Khuzami said in a statement. “When 
executives disregard their professional 
obligations to investors, both they and 
their companies face significant legal 
consequences.”a
A number of the SEC’s claims 
focused on premature revenue recogni￾tion. For example, Diebold was 
charged with improper use of “bill and 
hold” transactions. Under generally 
accepted accounting principles, revenue 
is typically recognized after a product is 
shipped. However, in some cases, sell￾ers can recognize revenue before ship￾ment for certain bill and hold transac￾tions. The SEC claimed that Diebold 
improperly used bill and hold account￾ing to record revenue prematurely.
The SEC also claimed that Diebold 
manipulated various accounting accru￾als. Diebold was accused of understat￾ing liabilities tied to its Long Term Incen￾tive Plan, commissions to be paid to 
sales personnel, and incentives to be 
paid to service personnel. Diebold tem￾porarily reduced a liability account set 
up for payment of customer rebates. The 
company was also accused of overstat￾ing the value of inventory and improper 
inventory write-ups.
Each of these activities allowed 
Diebold to inflate the company’s finan￾cial performance. According to the 
SEC’s complaint, Diebold’s fraudulent 
activities misstated reported pretax earn￾ings by at least $127 million between 
2002 and 2007. Two years prior to 
the settlement, Diebold restated earnings 
for the period covered by the charges.
The clawback provision of the 
2002 Sarbanes-Oxley antifraud law 
requires executives to repay compensa￾tion they receive while their company 
misled shareholders. Diebold’s former 
CEO, Walden O’Dell, agreed to return 
$470,000 in cash, plus stock and 
options. The SEC is currently pursuing 
a lawsuit against two other former 
Diebold executives for their part in the 
matter.

Tenney Company, a large janitorial service company, currently pays its employ￾ees at the end of each work week. The weekly payroll totals $400,000. If the firm 
were to extend the pay period so as to pay its employees 1 week later throughout 
an entire year, the employees would in effect be lending the firm $400,000 for a 
year. If the firm could earn 10% annually on invested funds, such a strategy 
would be worth $40,000 per year (0.10 * $400,000).

 16.2 unsecured Sources of Short-Term Loans
Businesses obtain unsecured short-term loans from two major sources, banks and 
sales of commercial paper. Unlike the spontaneous sources of unsecured short￾term financing, bank loans and commercial paper are negotiated and result from 
actions taken by the firm’s financial manager. Bank loans are more popular be￾cause they are available to firms of all sizes; commercial paper tends to be avail￾able only to large firms. In addition, firms can use international loans to finance 
international transactions.
BANK LOANS
Banks are a major source of unsecured short-term loans to businesses. The major 
type of loan made by banks to businesses is the short-term, self-liquidating loan. 
These loans are intended merely to carry the firm through seasonal peaks in fi￾nancing needs that are due primarily to buildups of inventory and accounts re￾ceivable. As the firm converts inventories and receivables into cash, the funds 
needed to retire these loans are generated. In other words, the use to which the 
borrowed money is put provides the mechanism through which the loan is re￾paid, hence the term self-liquidating.
Banks lend unsecured, short-term funds in three basic ways: through single￾payment notes, through lines of credit, and through revolving credit agreements. 
Before we look at these types of loans, we consider loan interest rates.
Loan Interest Rates
The interest rate on a bank loan can be a fixed or a floating rate, and the interest 
rate is often based on the prime rate of interest. The prime rate of interest (prime 
rate) is the lowest rate of interest charged by leading banks on business loans to 
their most important business borrowers. The prime rate fluctuates with 
Example 16.7 ▶

rate)

charged by leading banks on 
business loans to their most 
important business borrowers.704 PART 7   Short-Term Financial Decisions
changing supply-and-demand relationships for short-term funds. Banks generally 
determine the rate to be charged to various borrowers by adding a premium to 
the prime rate to adjust it for the borrower’s “riskiness.” The premium may 
amount to 4 percent or more, although many unsecured short-term loans carry 
premiums of less than 2 percent.
Fixed- and Floating-Rate Loans Loans can have either fixed or floating in￾terest rates. On a fixed-rate loan, the rate of interest is determined at a set incre￾ment above the prime rate on the date of the loan and remains unvarying at that 
fixed rate until maturity. On a floating-rate loan, the increment above the prime 
rate is initially established, and the rate of interest is allowed to “float,” or vary, 
above prime as the prime rate varies until maturity. Generally, the increment 
above the prime rate will be lower on a floating-rate loan than on a fixed-rate 
loan of equivalent risk because the lender bears less risk with a floating-rate loan. 
Most short-term business loans are floating-rate loans.
Method of Computing Interest Once the nominal (or stated) annual rate is 
established, the method of computing interest is determined. Interest can be paid 
either when a loan matures or in advance. If interest is paid at maturity, the 
effective (or true) annual rate—the actual rate of interest paid—for an assumed 
1-year period is equal to

discount loan
Loan on which interest is paid 
in advance by being deducted 
from the amount borrowed.
Interest
Amount borrowed (16.3)
Most bank loans to businesses require the interest payment at maturity.
When interest is paid in advance, it is deducted from the loan so that the bor￾rower actually receives less money than is requested (and less than they must re￾pay). Loans on which interest is paid in advance are called discount loans. The 
effective annual rate for a discount loan, assuming a 1-year period, is calculated as
Interest
Amount borrowed - Interest
(16.4)
Paying interest in advance raises the effective annual rate above the stated annual 
rate.
Wooster Company, a manufacturer of athletic apparel, wants to borrow $10,000 
at a stated annual rate of 10% interest for 1 year. If the interest on the loan is 
paid at maturity, the firm will pay $1,000 (0.10 * $10,000) for the use of the 
$10,000 for the year. At the end of the year, Wooster will write a check to the 
lender for $11,000, consisting of the $1,000 interest as well as the return of the 
$10,000 principal. Substituting into Equation 16.3 reveals that the effective an￾nual rate is therefore
$1,000
$10,000 = 10.0,
Example 16.8 ▶ChAPTER 16   Current Liabilities Management 705
If the money is borrowed at the same stated annual rate for 1 year but inter￾est is paid in advance, the firm still pays $1,000 in interest, but it receives only 
$9,000 ($10,000 - $1,000). The effective annual rate in this case is
$1,000
$10,000 - $1,000 =
$1,000
$9,000 = 11.1,
In this case, at the end of the year Wooster writes a check to the lender for 
$10,000, having “paid” the $1,000 in interest up front by borrowing just $9,000. 
Paying interest in advance thus makes the effective annual rate (11.1%) greater 
than the stated annual rate (10.0%).
Single-Payment Notes
A single-payment note can be obtained from a commercial bank by a creditwor￾thy business borrower. This type of loan is usually a one-time loan made to a 
borrower who needs funds for a specific purpose for a short period. The resulting 
instrument is a note, signed by the borrower, that states the terms of the loan, 
including the length of the loan and the interest rate. This type of short-term note 
generally has a maturity of 30 days to 9 months or more. The interest charged is 
usually tied in some way to the prime rate of interest.
Gordon Manufacturing, a producer of rotary mower blades, recently borrowed 
$100,000 from each of two banks, bank A and bank B. The loans were incurred 
on the same day, when the prime rate of interest was 6%. Each loan involved a 
90-day note with interest to be paid at the end of 90 days. The interest rate was 
set at 11
2% above the prime rate on bank A’s fixed-rate note. Over the 90-day 
period, the rate of interest on this note will remain at 71
2% (6% prime rate 1
1
1
2% increment) regardless of fluctuations in the prime rate. The total interest 
cost on this loan is $1.849 [$100,000 * (71
2, * 90 , 365)], which means that 
the 90-day rate on this loan is 1.85% ($1,849 , $100,000).
Assuming that the loan from bank A is rolled over each 90 days throughout 
the year under the same terms and circumstances, we can find its effective annual
interest rate, or EAR, by using Equation 5.10. Because the loan costs 1.85% for 
90 days, it is necessary to compound (1 + 0.0185) for 4.06 periods in the year (that 
is, 365 4 90) and then subtract 1:
EAR = (1 + 0.0185)4.06 - 1
= 1.0773 - 1 = 0.0773 = 7.73,
The effective annual rate of interest on the fixed-rate, 90-day note is 7.73%.
Bank B set the interest rate at 1% above the prime rate on its floating-rate note.
The rate charged over the 90 days will vary directly with the prime rate. Initially, the 
rate will be 7% (6% + 1%), but when the prime rate changes, so will the rate of 
interest on the note. For instance, if after 30 days the prime rate rises to 6.5% and 
after another 30 days it drops to 6.25%, the firm will be paying 0.575% for the first 
30 days (7% * 30 , 365), 0.616% for the next 30 days (7.5% * 30 , 365), and 
0.596% for the last 30 days (7.25% * 30 , 365). Its total interest cost will be 
$1,787 [$100,000 * (0.575, + 0.616, + 0.596,)], resulting in a 90-day rate 
of 1.79% ($1,787 , $100,000).

Again, assuming the loan is rolled over each 90 days throughout the year 
under the same terms and circumstances, its effective annual rate is 7.46%:
EAR = (1 + 0.01787)4.06 - 1
= 1.0746 - 1 = 0.0746 = 7.46,
Clearly, in this case the floating-rate loan would have been less expensive than 
the fixed-rate loan because of its generally lower effective annual rate.
Megan Schwartz has been approved by Clinton National Bank 
for a 180-day loan of $30,000 that will allow her to make the 
down payment and close the loan on her new condo. She needs the funds to bridge 
the time until the sale of her current condo, from which she expects to receive $42,000.
Clinton National offered Megan the following two financing options for the 
$30,000 loan: (1) a fixed-rate loan at 2% above the prime rate or (2) a variable￾rate loan at 1% above the prime rate. Currently, the prime rate of interest is 8%, 
and the consensus forecast of a group of mortgage economists for changes in the 
prime rate over the next 180 days is as follows:
60 days from today the prime rate will rise by 1%.
90 days from today the prime rate will rise another 1
2%.
150 days from today the prime rate will drop by 1%.
Using the forecast prime rate changes, Megan wishes to determine the lowest 
interest-cost loan for the next 6 months.
Fixed-Rate Loan: Total interest cost over 180 days
= $30,000 * (0.08 + 0.02) * (180 , 365)
= $30,000 * 0.04932 ≈ $1,480
Variable-Rate Loan: The applicable interest rate would begin at 9% (8% + 1%) 
and remain there for 60 days. Then the applicable rate would rise to 10% 
(9%11%) for the next 30 days and then to 10.50% (10% + 0.50%) for the 
next 60 days. Finally, the applicable rate would drop to 9.50% (10.50% - 1%) 
for the final 30 days.
Total interest cost over 180 days
= $30,000 * 3 10.09 * 60 , 3652 + 10.10 * 30 , 3652
 + 10.105 * 60 , 3652 + 10.095 * 30 , 3652 4
= $30,000 * 10.01479 + 0.00822 + 0.01726 + 0.007812
= $30,000 * 0.04808 ≈ $1,442
Because the estimated total interest cost on the variable-rate loan of $1,442 is 
less than the total interest cost of $1,480 on the fixed-rate loan, Megan should take 
the variable-rate loan. By doing so, she will save about $38 ($1,480 - $1,442) in 
interest cost over the 180 days.
Lines of Credit
A line of credit is an agreement between a commercial bank and a business, spec￾ifying the amount of unsecured short-term borrowing that the bank will make 
available to the firm over a given period of time. It is similar to the agreement 
Personal Finance Example 16.10 ▶

commercial bank and a 
business specifying the amount 
of unsecured short-term 
borrowing the bank will make 
available to the firm over a 
given period of time.ChAPTER 16   Current Liabilities Management 707
under which issuers of bank credit cards, such as MasterCard, Visa, and Dis￾cover, extend preapproved credit to cardholders. A line-of-credit agreement is 
typically made for a period of 1 year and often places certain constraints on the 
borrower. It is not a guaranteed loan; rather, it indicates that if the bank has suf￾ficient funds available, it will allow the borrower to owe it up to a certain amount 
of money. The amount of a line of credit is the maximum amount the firm can 
owe the bank at any point in time.
When applying for a line of credit, the borrower may be required to submit 
such documents as its cash budget, pro forma income statement, pro forma bal￾ance sheet, and recent financial statements. If the bank finds the customer accept￾able, the line of credit will be extended. The major attraction of a line of credit 
from the bank’s point of view is that it eliminates the need to examine the credit￾worthiness of a customer each time it borrows money within the year.
Interest Rates The interest rate on a line of credit is normally stated as a 
floating rate: the prime rate plus a premium. If the prime rate changes, the inter￾est rate charged on new as well as outstanding borrowing automatically changes. 
The amount a borrower is charged in excess of the prime rate depends on its 
creditworthiness. The more creditworthy the borrower, the lower the premium 
(interest increment) above prime and vice versa.
Operating-Change Restrictions In a line-of-credit agreement, a bank may 
impose operating-change restrictions, which give it the right to revoke the line if 
any major changes occur in the firm’s financial condition or operations. The firm 
is usually required to submit up-to-date, and preferably audited, financial state￾ments for periodic review. In addition, the bank typically needs to be informed of 
shifts in key managerial personnel or in the firm’s operations before changes take 
place. Such changes may affect the future success and debt-paying ability of the 
firm and thus could alter its credit status. If the bank does not agree with the 
proposed changes and the firm makes them anyway, the bank has the right to 
revoke the line of credit.
Compensating Balances To ensure that the borrower will be a “good cus￾tomer,” many short-term unsecured bank loans—single-payment notes and lines 
of credit—require the borrower to maintain, in a checking account, a compensating 
balance equal to a certain percentage of the amount borrowed. Banks frequently 
require compensating balances of 10 to 20 percent. A compensating balance not 
only forces the borrower to be a good customer of the bank but may also raise 
the interest cost to the borrower.
Estrada Graphics, a graphic design firm, has borrowed $1 million under a line-of￾credit agreement. It must pay a stated interest rate of 10% and maintain, in its 
checking account, a compensating balance equal to 20% of the amount bor￾rowed, or $200,000. Thus, it actually receives the use of only $800,000. To use 
that amount for a year, the firm pays interest of $100,000 (0.10 * $1,000,000). 
The effective annual rate on the funds is therefore 12.5% ($100,000 ,
$800,000), which is 2.5% more than the stated rate of 10%.
If the firm normally maintains a balance of $200,000 or more in its checking 
account, the effective annual rate equals the stated annual rate of 10% because

Video708 PART 7   Short-Term Financial Decisions
none of the $1 million borrowed is needed to satisfy the compensating-balance 
requirement. If the firm normally maintains a $100,000 balance in its checking 
account, only an additional $100,000 will have to be tied up, leaving it with 
$900,000 of usable funds. The effective annual rate in this case would be 11.1% 
($100,000 , $900,000). Thus, a compensating balance raises the cost of bor￾rowing only if it is larger than the firm’s normal cash balance.
Annual Cleanups To ensure that money lent under a line-of-credit agree￾ment is actually being used to finance seasonal needs, many banks require an 
annual cleanup. In these cases, the borrower must have a loan balance of zero—
that is, owe the bank nothing—for a certain number of days during the year. In￾sisting that the borrower carry a zero loan balance for a certain period ensures 
that short-term loans do not turn into long-term loans.
All the characteristics of a line-of-credit agreement are negotiable to some 
extent. Today, banks bid competitively to attract large, well-known firms. A pro￾spective borrower should attempt to negotiate a line of credit with the most fa￾vorable interest rate, for an optimal amount of funds, and with a minimum of 
restrictions. Borrowers today frequently pay fees to lenders instead of maintain￾ing deposit balances as compensation for loans and other services. The lender 
attempts to get a good return with maximum safety. Negotiations should pro￾duce a line of credit that is suitable to both borrower and lender.
Revolving Credit Agreements
A revolving credit agreement is nothing more than a guaranteed line of credit. It 
is guaranteed in the sense that the commercial bank assures the borrower that a 
specified amount of funds will be made available regardless of the scarcity of 
money. The interest rate and other requirements are similar to those for a line of 
credit. It is not uncommon for a revolving credit agreement to be for a period 
greater than 1 year.2
 Because the bank guarantees the availability of funds, a 
commitment fee is normally charged on a revolving credit agreement. This fee 
often applies to the average unused balance of the borrower’s credit line. It is 
normally about 0.5 percent of the average unused portion of the line.
REH Company, a major real estate developer, has a $2 million revolving credit 
agreement with its bank. Its average borrowing under the agreement for the past 
year was $1.5 million. The bank charges a commitment fee of 0.5% on the aver￾age unused balance. Because the average unused portion of the committed funds 
was $500,000 ($2 million - $1.5 million), the commitment fee for the year was 
$2,500 (0.005 * $500,000). Of course, REH also had to pay interest on the ac￾tual $1.5 million borrowed under the agreement. Assuming that $112,500 inter￾est was paid on the $1.5 million borrowed, the effective cost of the agreement 
was 7.67% [($112,500 + $2,500) , $1,500,000]. Although more expensive 
than a line of credit, a revolving credit agreement can be less risky from the bor￾rower’s viewpoint because the availability of funds is guaranteed.

2. Many authors classify the revolving credit agreement as a form of intermediate-term financing, defined as having 
a maturity of 1 to 7 years, but we do not use the intermediate-term financing classification; only short-term and 
long-term classifications are made. Because many revolving credit agreements are for more than 1 year, they can be 
classified as a form of long-term financing; however, they are discussed here because of their similarity to line-of￾credit agreements.

COMMERCIAL PAPER
Commercial paper is a form of financing that consists of short-term, unsecured 
promissory notes issued by firms with a high credit standing. Generally, only large 
firms of unquestionable financial soundness are able to issue commercial paper. 
Most commercial paper issues have maturities ranging from 3 to 270 days. Al￾though there is no set denomination, such financing is generally issued in multiples 
of $100,000 or more. A large portion of the commercial paper today is issued by 
finance companies; manufacturing firms account for a smaller portion of this type 
of financing. Businesses often purchase commercial paper, which they hold as mar￾ketable securities, to provide an interest-earning reserve of liquidity. For further 
information on recent use of commercial paper, see the Focus on Practice box.
Interest on Commercial Paper

The difficult economic 
and credit environment 
in the post–September 11 era, com￾bined with historically low interest rates 
and a deep desire by corporate issuers 
to reduce exposure to refinancing risk, 
had a depressing effect on commercial 
paper volumes from 2001 through 
2003. According to the Federal 
Reserve, U.S. nonfinancial commercial 
paper, for example, declined 68 per￾cent over the 3-year period, from 
$315.8 billion outstanding at the 
beginning of 2001 to $101.4 billion 
by December 2003. In addition to 
lower volume, credit quality of commer￾cial paper declined over the same 
period, with the ratio of downgrades 
outpacing upgrades 17 to 1 in 2002.
In 2004, signs emerged that the 
volume and rating contraction in com￾mercial paper was finally coming to an 
end. The most encouraging of them 
was the pickup in economic growth, 
which spurs the need for short-term debt 
to finance corporate working capital. 
Although commercial paper is typically 
used to fund working capital, it is often 
boosted by a sudden surge of borrow￾ing activity for other strategic activities, 
focus on PRACTICE
in practice
The Ebb and Flow of Commercial Paper
Even with the CPFF up and running, 
companies that were worried about 
their ability to roll over their outstanding 
commercial paper every few weeks 
turned to long-term debt to meet their 
liquidity needs. Merrill Lynch & Co. and 
Bloomberg data showed that to man￾age short-tem liability risk, companies 
were paying as much as $75 million in 
additional annual interest to swap long￾term debt for $1 billion of 30-day com￾mercial paper.
With the recession in the rearview 
mirror and short-term credit markets 
working again, the CPFF was closed on 
February 1, 2010. But three years later, 
the commercial paper market was still 
far smaller than it had been before the 
financial crisis. In March 2013, the 
Federal Reserve reported that the total 
amount of commercial paper outstand￾ing was a little more than $1 trillion, 
about half the size of the market in 
2007 before the crisis.

such as mergers and acquisitions and 
long-term capital investments. According 
to Federal Reserve Board data, at the 
end of July 2004, total U.S. commercial 
paper outstanding was $1.33 trillion.
By 2006, commercial paper surged 
to $1.98 trillion, an increase of 21.5 
percent over 2005 levels. However, 
after peaking at $2.22 trillion, the tide 
changed in response to the credit crisis 
that began in August 2007. According 
to Federal Reserve data, as of October 
1, 2008, the commercial paper market 
had contracted to $1.6 trillion, a reduc￾tion of nearly 28 percent, and new 
issues virtually dried up for several 
weeks. With much of the commercial 
paper outstanding at the start of the 
credit crisis coming up for renewal, the 
Federal Reserve began operating the 
Commercial Paper Funding Facility 
(CPFF) on October 27, 2008. The CPFF 
was intended to provide a liquidity back￾stop to U.S. issuers of commercial paper 
and, thereby, increase the availability of 
credit in short-term capital markets. CPFF 
allowed for the Federal Reserve Bank of 
New York to finance the purchase of

commercial paper from eligible issuers.710 PART 7   Short-Term Financial Decisions
issuer of commercial paper. The actual interest earned by the purchaser is deter￾mined by certain calculations, illustrated by the following example.
Bertram Corporation, a large shipbuilder, has just issued $1 million worth of 
commercial paper that has a 90-day maturity and sells for $990,000. At the end 
of 90 days, the purchaser of this paper will receive $1 million for its $990,000 
investment. The interest paid on the financing is therefore $10,000 on a principal 
of $990,000. The effective 90-day rate on the paper is 1.01% ($10,000 ,
$990,000). Assuming that the paper is rolled over each 90 days throughout the 
year (that is, 365 , 90 = 4.06 times per year), the effective annual rate for Ber￾tram’s commercial paper, found by using Equation 5.10, is 4.16% 
[(1 + 0.0101)4.06 - 1].
An interesting characteristic of commercial paper is that its interest cost is 
normally 2 percent to 4 percent below the prime rate. In other words, firms are 
able to raise funds more cheaply by selling commercial paper than by borrowing 
from a commercial bank. The reason is that many suppliers of short-term funds 
do not have the option, as banks do, of making low-risk business loans at the 
prime rate. They can invest safely only in marketable securities such as Treasury 
bills and commercial paper.
Although the stated interest cost of borrowing through the sale of commer￾cial paper is normally lower than the prime rate, the overall cost of commercial 
paper may not be less than that of a bank loan. Additional costs include various 
fees and flotation costs. Also, even if it is slightly more expensive to borrow from 
a commercial bank, it may at times be advisable to do so to establish a good 
working relationship with a bank. This strategy ensures that when money is tight, 
funds can be obtained promptly and at a reasonable interest rate.
Example 16.13 ▶
Matter of fact
C
ommercial banks are legally prohibited from lending amounts in excess of 15 percent (plus an 
additional 10 percent for loans secured by readily marketable collateral) of the bank’s unim￾paired capital and surplus to any one borrower. This restriction is intended to protect depositors by 
forcing the commercial bank to spread its risk across a number of borrowers. In addition, smaller 
commercial banks do not have many opportunities to lend to large, high-quality business borrowers.

INTERNATIONAL LOANS
In some ways, arranging short-term financing for international trade is no differ￾ent from financing purely domestic operations. In both cases, producers must 
finance production and inventory and then continue to finance accounts receiv￾able before collecting any cash payments from sales. In other ways, however, the 
short-term financing of international sales and purchases is fundamentally differ￾ent from that of strictly domestic trade.
International Transactions
The important difference between international and domestic transactions is that 
payments are often made or received in a foreign currency. Not only must a U.S.

company pay the costs of doing business in the foreign exchange market, but it 
also is exposed to exchange rate risk. A U.S.-based company that exports goods 
and has accounts receivable denominated in a foreign currency faces the risk that 
the U.S. dollar will appreciate in value relative to the foreign currency. The risk to 
a U.S. importer with foreign-currency-denominated accounts payable is that the 
dollar will depreciate. Although exchange rate risk can often be hedged by using 
currency forward, futures, or options markets, doing so is costly and is not pos￾sible for all foreign currencies.
Typical international transactions are large in size and have long maturity 
dates. Therefore, companies that are involved in international trade generally 
have to finance larger dollar amounts for longer time periods than companies 
that operate domestically. Furthermore, because foreign companies are rarely 
well known in the United States, some financial institutions are reluctant to lend 
to U.S. exporters or importers, particularly smaller firms.
Financing International Trade
Several specialized techniques have evolved for financing international trade. Per￾haps the most important financing vehicle is the letter of credit, a letter written by 
a company’s bank to the company’s foreign supplier, stating that the bank guar￾antees payment of an invoiced amount if all the underlying agreements are met. 
The letter of credit essentially substitutes the bank’s reputation and creditworthi￾ness for that of its commercial customer. A U.S. exporter is more willing to sell 
goods to a foreign buyer if the transaction is covered by a letter of credit issued by 
a well-known bank in the buyer’s home country.
Firms that do business in foreign countries on an ongoing basis often finance 
their operations, at least in part, in the local market. A company that has an as￾sembly plant in Mexico, for example, might choose to finance its purchases of 
Mexican goods and services with peso funds borrowed from a Mexican bank. 
This practice not only minimizes exchange rate risk but also improves the com￾pany’s business ties to the host community. Multinational companies, however, 
sometimes finance their international transactions through dollar-denominated 
loans from international banks. The Eurocurrency loan markets allow creditwor￾thy borrowers to obtain financing on attractive terms.
Transactions between Subsidiaries
Much international trade involves transactions between corporate subsidiaries. 
A U.S. company might, for example, manufacture one part in an Asian plant 
and another part in the United States, assemble the product in Brazil, and sell 
it in Europe. The shipment of goods back and forth between subsidiaries cre￾ates accounts receivable and accounts payable, but the parent company has 
considerable discretion about how and when payments are made. In particular, 
the parent can minimize foreign exchange fees and other transaction costs by 
“netting” what affiliates owe each other and paying only the net amount due 
rather than having both subsidiaries pay each other the gross amounts due.

 16.3 Secured Sources of Short-Term Loans
When a firm has exhausted its sources of unsecured short-term financing, it may 
be able to obtain additional short-term loans on a secured basis. Secured short￾term financing has specific assets pledged as collateral. The collateral commonly 
takes the form of an asset, such as accounts receivable or inventory. The lender 
obtains a security interest in the collateral through the execution of a security 
agreement with the borrower that specifies the collateral held against the loan. In 
addition, the terms of the loan against which the security is held form part of the 
security agreement. A copy of the security agreement is filed in a public office 
within the state, usually a county or state court. Filing provides subsequent 
lenders with information about which assets of a prospective borrower are un￾available for use as collateral. The filing requirement protects the lender by legally 
establishing the lender’s security interest.
ChARACTERISTICS OF SECuREd ShORT-TERM LOANS
Although many people believe that holding collateral as security reduces the risk 
that a loan will default, lenders do not usually view loans in this way. Lenders 
recognize that holding collateral can reduce losses if the borrower defaults, but 
the presence of collateral has no impact on the risk of default. A lender requires 
collateral to ensure recovery of some portion of the loan in the event of default. 
What the lender wants above all, however, is to be repaid as scheduled. In gen￾eral, lenders prefer to make less risky loans at lower rates of interest than to be in 
a position in which they must liquidate collateral.
Collateral and Terms
Lenders of secured short-term funds prefer collateral that has a duration closely 
matched to the term of the loan. Current assets are the most desirable short-term￾loan collateral because they can normally be converted into cash much sooner 
than fixed assets. Thus, the short-term lender of secured funds generally accepts 
only liquid current assets as collateral.

collateral.
security agreement
The agreement between the

specifies the collateral held

LG 5 LG 6ChAPTER 16   Current Liabilities Management 713
Typically, the lender determines the desirable percentage advance to make 
against the collateral. This percentage advance constitutes the principal of the 
secured loan and is normally between 30 and 100 percent of the book value of 
the collateral. It varies according to the type and liquidity of collateral.
The interest rate that is charged on secured short-term loans is typically 
higher than the rate on unsecured short-term loans. Lenders do not normally con￾sider secured loans less risky than unsecured loans. In addition, negotiating and 
administering secured loans is more troublesome for the lender than negotiating 
and administering unsecured loans. The lender therefore normally requires added 
compensation in the form of a service charge, a higher interest rate, or both.
Institutions Extending Secured Short-Term Loans
The primary sources of secured short-term loans to businesses are commercial 
banks and commercial finance companies. Both institutions deal in short-term loans 
secured primarily by accounts receivable and inventory. We have already described 
the operations of commercial banks. Commercial finance companies are lending 
institutions that make only secured loans—both short-term and long-term—to 
businesses. Unlike banks, finance companies are not permitted to hold deposits.
Only when its unsecured and secured short-term borrowing power from the 
commercial bank is exhausted will a borrower turn to the commercial finance 
company for additional secured borrowing. Because the finance company gener￾ally ends up with higher-risk borrowers, its interest charges on secured short￾term loans are usually higher than those of commercial banks. The leading U.S. 
commercial finance companies include the CIT Group and General Electric Cor￾porate Financial Services.
uSE OF ACCOuNTS RECEIVABLE AS COLLATERAL
Two commonly used means of obtaining short-term financing with accounts re￾ceivable are pledging accounts receivable and factoring accounts receivable. Ac￾tually, only a pledge of accounts receivable creates a secured short-term loan; 
factoring really entails the sale of accounts receivable at a discount. Although 
factoring is not actually a form of secured short-term borrowing, it does involve 
the use of accounts receivable to obtain needed short-term funds.
Pledging Accounts Receivable
A pledge of accounts receivable is often used to secure a short-term loan. Because 
accounts receivable are normally quite liquid, they are an attractive form of 
short-term-loan collateral.
The Pledging Process When a firm requests a loan against accounts receiv￾able, the lender first evaluates the firm’s accounts receivable to determine their 
desirability as collateral. The lender makes a list of the acceptable accounts, along 
with the billing dates and amounts. If the borrowing firm requests a loan for a 
fixed amount, the lender needs to select only enough accounts to secure the funds 
requested. If the borrower wants the maximum loan available, the lender evalu￾ates all the accounts to select the maximum amount of acceptable collateral.
After selecting the acceptable accounts, the lender normally adjusts the dollar 
value of these accounts for expected returns on sales and other allowances. If a 
customer whose account has been pledged returns merchandise or receives some

type of allowance, such as a cash discount for early payment, the amount of the 
collateral is automatically reduced. For protection from such occurrences, the 
lender normally reduces the value of the acceptable collateral by a fixed percentage.
Next, the percentage to be advanced against the collateral must be deter￾mined. The lender evaluates the quality of the acceptable receivables and the ex￾pected cost of their liquidation. This percentage represents the principal of the 
loan and typically ranges between 50 and 90 percent of the face value of accept￾able accounts receivable. To protect its interest in the collateral, the lender files a 
lien, which is a publicly disclosed legal claim on the collateral.
Notification Pledges of accounts receivable are normally made on a 
nonnotification basis, meaning that a customer whose account has been pledged as 
collateral is not notified. Under the nonnotification arrangement, the borrower still 
collects the pledged account receivable, and the lender trusts the borrower to remit 
these payments as they are received. If a pledge of accounts receivable is made on a 
notification basis, the customer is notified to remit payment directly to the lender.

F
ounded in 2007, the Receivables Exchange is an online marketplace where organizations such 
as hedge funds and commercial banks looking for short-term investments can bid on receiv￾ables pledged by small, medium-sized, and large companies from a wide range of industries. 
Companies that need cash put their receivables up for auction on the Receivables Exchange, and 
investors bid on them. In its first few years of operation, the Receivables Exchange provided funding 
of more than $1 billion to companies selling their receivables. The Receivables Exchange attracted 
the attention of the NYSE Euronext, which purchased a minority stake in the company in 2011.
Receivables Trading
Pledging Cost The stated cost of a pledge of accounts receivable is normally 2 
to 5 percent above the prime rate. In addition to the stated interest rate, a service 
charge of up to 3 percent may be levied by the lender to cover its administrative costs. 
Clearly, pledges of accounts receivable are a high-cost source of short-term financing.
Factoring Accounts Receivable
Factoring accounts receivable involves selling them outright, at a discount, to a 
financial institution. A factor is a financial institution that specializes in purchas￾ing accounts receivable from businesses. Although it is not the same as obtaining 
a short-term loan, factoring accounts receivable is similar to borrowing with ac￾counts receivable as collateral.
Factoring Agreement A factoring agreement normally states the exact condi￾tions and procedures for the purchase of an account. The factor, like a lender 
against a pledge of accounts receivable, chooses accounts for purchase, selecting 
only those that appear to be acceptable credit risks. Where factoring is to be on a 
continuing basis, the factor will actually make the firm’s credit decisions because 
this will guarantee the acceptability of accounts. Factoring is normally done on a 
notification basis, and the factor receives payment of the account directly from the 
customer. In addition, most sales of accounts receivable to a factor are made on a 
nonrecourse basis, meaning that the factor agrees to accept all credit risks. Thus, if 
a purchased account turns out to be uncollectible, the factor must absorb the loss.ChAPTER 16   Current Liabilities Management 715
Typically, the factor is not required to pay the firm until the account is col￾lected or until the last day of the credit period, whichever occurs first. The factor 
sets up an account similar to a bank deposit account for each customer. As pay￾ment is received or as due dates arrive, the factor deposits money into the seller’s 
account, from which the seller is free to make withdrawals as needed.
In many cases, if the firm leaves the money in the account, a surplus will exist 
on which the factor will pay interest. In other instances, the factor may make ad￾vances to the firm against uncollected accounts that are not yet due. These advances 
represent a negative balance in the firm’s account, on which interest is charged.
Factoring Cost Factoring costs include commissions, interest levied on ad￾vances, and interest earned on surpluses. The factor deposits in the firm’s account the 
book value of the collected or due accounts purchased by the factor, less the commis￾sions. The commissions are typically stated as a 1 to 3 percent discount from the 
book value of factored accounts receivable. The interest levied on advances is gener￾ally 2 to 4 percent above the prime rate. It is levied on the actual amount advanced. 
The interest paid on surpluses is generally between 0.2 and 0.5 percent per month.
Although its costs may seem high, factoring has certain advantages that make 
it attractive to many firms. One is the ability it gives the firm to turn accounts 
receivable immediately into cash without having to worry about repayment. An￾other advantage is that it ensures a known pattern of cash flows. In addition, if 
factoring is undertaken on a continuing basis, the firm can eliminate its credit and 
collection departments.
uSE OF INVENTORY AS COLLATERAL
Inventory is generally second to accounts receivable in desirability as short-term 
loan collateral. Inventory normally has a market value that is greater than its 
book value, which is used to establish its value as collateral. A lender whose loan 
is secured with inventory will probably be able to sell that inventory for at least 
book value if the borrower defaults on its obligations.
The most important characteristic of inventory being evaluated as loan col￾lateral is marketability. A warehouse of perishable items, such as fresh peaches, 
may be quite marketable, but if the cost of storing and selling the peaches is high, 
they may not be desirable collateral. Specialized items, such as moon-roving ve￾hicles, are also not desirable collateral because finding a buyer for them could be 
difficult. When evaluating inventory as possible loan collateral, the lender looks 
for items with very stable market prices that have ready markets and that lack 
undesirable physical properties.
Matter of fact
T
he use of credit cards such as MasterCard, Visa, and Discover by consumers has some sim￾ilarity to factoring because the vendor that accepts the card is reimbursed at a discount for 
purchases made with the card. The difference between factoring and credit cards is that cards 
are nothing more than a line of credit extended by the issuer, which charges the vendors a fee 
for accepting the cards. In factoring, the factor does not analyze credit until after the sale has 
been made; in many cases (except when factoring is done on a continuing basis), the initial 
credit decision is the responsibility of the vendor, not the factor that purchases the account.
Quasi Factoring716 PART 7   Short-Term Financial Decisions
Floating Inventory Liens
A lender may be willing to secure a loan under a floating inventory lien, which is a 
claim on inventory in general. This arrangement is most attractive when the firm 
has a stable level of inventory that consists of a diversified group of relatively inex￾pensive merchandise. Inventories of items such as auto tires, screws and bolts, and 
shoes are candidates for floating-lien loans. Because it is difficult for a lender to 
verify the presence of the inventory, the lender generally advances less than 50 per￾cent of the book value of the average inventory. The interest charge on a floating 
lien is 3 to 5 percent above the prime rate. Commercial banks often require float￾ing liens as extra security on what would otherwise be an unsecured loan. Floating￾lien inventory loans may also be available from commercial finance companies.
Trust Receipt Inventory Loans
A trust receipt inventory loan often can be made against relatively expensive au￾tomotive, consumer durable, and industrial goods that can be identified by serial 
number. Under this agreement, the borrower keeps the inventory, and the lender 
may advance 80 to 100 percent of its cost. The lender files a lien on all the items 
financed. The borrower is free to sell the merchandise but is trusted to remit the 
amount lent, along with accrued interest, to the lender immediately after the sale. 
The lender then releases the lien on the item. The lender makes periodic checks of 
the borrower’s inventory to make sure that the required collateral remains in the 
hands of the borrower. The interest charge to the borrower is normally 2 percent 
or more above the prime rate.
Trust receipt loans are often made by manufacturers’ wholly owned financing 
subsidiaries, known as captive finance companies, to their customers. Captive fi￾nance companies are especially popular in industries that manufacture consumer 
durable goods because they provide the manufacturer with a useful sales tool. For 
example, General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the financing subsidiary of 
General Motors, grants these types of loans to its dealers. Trust receipt loans are 
also available through commercial banks and commercial finance companies.
Warehouse Receipt Loans
A warehouse receipt loan is an arrangement whereby the lender, which may be a 
commercial bank or finance company, receives control of the pledged inventory 
collateral, which is stored by a designated agent on the lender’s behalf. After se￾lecting acceptable collateral, the lender hires a warehousing company to act as its 
agent and take possession of the inventory.
Two types of warehousing arrangements are possible. A terminal warehouse is 
a central warehouse that is used to store the merchandise of various customers. The 
lender normally uses such a warehouse when the inventory is easily transported 
and can be delivered to the warehouse relatively inexpensively. Under a field ware￾house arrangement, the lender hires a field-warehousing company to set up a ware￾house on the borrower’s premises or to lease part of the borrower’s warehouse to 
store the pledged collateral. Regardless of the type of warehouse, the warehousing 
company places a guard over the inventory. Only on written approval of the lender 
can any portion of the secured inventory be released by the warehousing company.
The actual lending agreement specifically states the requirements for the re￾lease of inventory. As with other secured loans, the lender accepts only collateral 
that it believes to be readily marketable and advances only a portion—generally

sale of each item of collateral.

75 to 90 percent—of the collateral’s value. The specific costs of warehouse re￾ceipt loans are generally higher than those of any other secured lending arrange￾ments because of the need to hire and pay a warehousing company to guard and 
supervise the collateral. The basic interest charged on warehouse receipt loans is 
higher than that charged on unsecured loans, generally ranging from 3 to 5 per￾cent above the prime rate. In addition to the interest charge, the borrower must 
absorb the costs of warehousing by paying the warehouse fee, which is generally 
between 1 and 3 percent of the amount of the loan. The borrower is normally 
also required to pay the insurance costs on the warehoused merchandise.

Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
Current liabilities represent an important and generally inexpensive source of fi￾nancing for a firm. The level of short-term (current liabilities) financing employed 
by a firm affects its profitability and risk. Accounts payable and accruals are spon￾taneous liabilities that should be carefully managed because they represent free fi￾nancing. Notes payable, which represent negotiated short-term financing, should 
be obtained at the lowest cost under the best possible terms. Large, well-known 
firms can obtain unsecured short-term financing through the sale of commercial 
paper. On a secured basis, the firm can obtain loans from banks or commercial 
finance companies, using either accounts receivable or inventory as collateral.
The financial manager must obtain the right quantity and form of current lia￾bilities financing to provide the lowest-cost funds with the least risk. Such a strat￾egy should positively contribute to the firm’s goal of maximizing the stock price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Review accounts payable, the key components of credit terms, and the 
procedures for analyzing those terms. The major spontaneous source of short￾term financing is accounts payable. They are the primary source of short-term 
funds. Credit terms may differ with respect to the credit period, cash discount,

cash discount period, and beginning of the credit period. Cash discounts should 
be given up only when a firm in need of short-term funds must pay an interest 
rate on borrowing that is greater than the cost of giving up the cash discount.
Understand the effects of stretching accounts payable on their cost and 
the use of accruals. Stretching accounts payable can lower the cost of giving up 
a cash discount. Accruals, which result primarily from wage and tax obligations, 
are virtually free.
Describe interest rates and the basic types of unsecured bank sources of 
short-term loans. Banks are the major source of unsecured short-term loans to 
businesses. The interest rate on these loans is tied to the prime rate of interest by 
a risk premium and may be fixed or floating. It should be evaluated by using the 
effective annual rate. Whether interest is paid when the loan matures or in ad￾vance affects the rate. Bank loans may take the form of a single-payment note, a 
line of credit, or a revolving credit agreement.
Discuss the basic features of commercial paper and the key aspects of in￾ternational short-term loans. Commercial paper is an unsecured IOU issued by 
firms with a high credit standing. International sales and purchases expose firms 
to exchange rate risk. Such transactions are larger and of longer maturity than 
domestic transactions, and they can be financed by using a letter of credit, by 
borrowing in the local market, or through dollar-denominated loans from inter￾national banks. On transactions between subsidiaries, “netting” can be used to 
minimize foreign exchange fees and other transaction costs.
Explain the characteristics of secured short-term loans and the use of ac￾counts receivable as short-term-loan collateral. Secured short-term loans are 
those for which the lender requires collateral, which are usually current assets 
such as accounts receivable or inventory. Only a percentage of the book value of 
acceptable collateral is advanced by the lender. These loans are more expensive 
than unsecured loans. Commercial banks and commercial finance companies 
make secured short-term loans. Both pledging and factoring involve the use of 
accounts receivable to obtain needed short-term funds.
Describe the various ways in which inventory can be used as short-term￾loan collateral. Inventory can be used as short-term-loan collateral under a

Dining room sets are typically one of the more expensive home furnishing items, and 
the store offers financing arrangements to customers. Bob and Carol have the cash 
to pay for the furniture, but it would definitely deplete their savings, so they want to 
look at all their options.
The dining room set costs $3,000, and Furniture R’Us offers a financing plan 
that would allow them to either (1) put 10% down and finance the balance at 4% 
annual interest over 24 months or (2) receive an immediate $200 cash rebate, 
thereby paying only $2,800 cash to buy the furniture.
Bob and Carol currently earn 5.2% annual interest on their savings.
a. Calculate the cash down payment for the loan.
b. Calculate the monthly payment on the available loan. (Hint: Treat the current 
loan as an annuity and solve for the monthly payment.)
c. Calculate the initial cash outlay under the cash purchase option.

prearranged borrowing agreement with a local commercial bank. The bank’s terms 
for a line of credit are 3.30% over the prime rate, and each year the borrowing must 
be reduced to zero for a 30-day period. For an equivalent revolving credit agree￾ment, the rate is 2.80% over prime with a commitment fee of 0.50% on the average 
unused balance. With both loans, the required compensating balance is equal to 
20% of the amount borrowed. (Note: Cumberland currently maintains $0 on de￾posit at the bank.) The prime rate is currently 8%. Both agreements have $4 million

low, but its inventory is considered liquid and reasonably good collateral. The book 
value of the inventory is $300,000, of which $120,000 is finished goods. (Note: As￾sume a 365-day year.)
(1) City-Wide Bank will make a $100,000 trust receipt loan against the finished 
goods inventory. The annual interest rate on the loan is 12% on the outstanding 
loan balance plus a 0.25% administration fee levied against the $100,000 initial 
loan amount. Because it will be liquidated as inventory is sold, the average 
amount owed over the month is expected to be $75,000.
(2) Sun State Bank will lend $100,000 against a floating lien on the book value of 
inventory for the 1-month period at an annual interest rate of 13%.
(3) Citizens’ Bank and Trust will lend $100,000 against a warehouse receipt on the 
finished goods inventory and charge 15% annual interest on the outstanding 
loan balance. A 0.5% warehousing fee will be levied against the average amount 
borrowed. Because the loan will be liquidated as inventory is sold, the average

Integrative Case 7
Casa de Diseño
I
n January 2015, Teresa Leal was named treasurer of Casa de Diseño. She decided 
that she could best orient herself by systematically examining each area of the 
company’s financial operations. She began by studying the firm’s short-term finan￾cial activities.
Casa de Diseño, located in southern California, specializes in a furniture line 
called “Ligne Moderna.” Of high quality and contemporary design, the furniture 
appeals to the customer who wants something unique for his or her home or apart￾ment. Most Ligne Moderna furniture is built by special order because a wide variety 
of upholstery, accent trimming, and colors is available. The product line is distrib￾uted through exclusive dealership arrangements with well-established retail stores. 
Casa de Diseño’s manufacturing process virtually eliminates the use of wood. Plastic 
and metal provide the basic framework, and wood is used only for decorative 
purposes.
Casa de Diseño entered the plastic-furniture market in late 2007. The company 
markets its plastic-furniture products as indoor–outdoor items under the brand 
name “Futuro.” Futuro plastic furniture emphasizes comfort, durability, and practi￾cality and is distributed through wholesalers. The Futuro line has been very success￾ful, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the firm’s sales and profits in 2014. Casa de 
Diseño anticipates some additions to the Futuro line and also some limited change of 
direction in its promotion in an effort to expand the applications of the plastic 
furniture.
Leal has decided to study the firm’s cash management practices. To determine 
the effects of these practices, she must first determine the current operating and cash 
conversion cycles. In her investigations, she found that Casa de Diseño purchases all 
its raw materials and production supplies on open account. The company is operat￾ing at production levels that preclude volume discounts. Most suppliers do not offer 
cash discounts, and Casa de Diseño usually receives credit terms of net 30. An analy￾sis of Casa de Diseño’s accounts payable showed that its average payment period is 
30 days. Leal consulted industry data and found that the industry average payment 
period was 39 days. Investigation of six California furniture manufacturers revealed 
that their average payment period was also 39 days.
Next, Leal studied the production cycle and inventory policies. Casa de Diseño 
tries not to hold any more inventory than necessary in either raw materials or fin￾ished goods. The average inventory age was 110 days. Leal determined that the in￾dustry standard, as reported in a survey done by Furniture Age, the trade association 
journal, was 83 days.
Casa de Diseño sells to all its customers on a net-60 basis, in line with the indus￾try trend to grant such credit terms on specialty furniture. Leal discovered, by aging 
the accounts receivable, that the average collection period for the firm was 75 days. 
Investigation of the trade association’s and California manufacturers’ averages 
showed that the same collection period existed where net-60 credit terms were given. 
Where cash discounts were offered, the collection period was significantly shortened. 
Leal believed that if Casa de Diseño were to offer credit terms of 3/10 net 60, the 
average collection period could be reduced by 40 percent.728
Casa de Diseño was spending an estimated $26,500,000 per year on operating￾cycle investments. Leal considered this expenditure level to be the minimum she 
could expect the firm to disburse during 2015. Her concern was whether the firm’s 
cash management was as efficient as it could be. She knew that the company paid 
15 percent annual interest for its resource investment. For this reason, she was con￾cerned about the financing cost resulting from any inefficiencies in the management 
of Casa de Diseño’s cash conversion cycle. (Note: Assume a 365-day year, and as￾sume that the operating-cycle investment per dollar of payables, inventory, and 
receivables is the same.)
TO dO
a. Assuming a constant rate for purchases, production, and sales throughout the 
year, what are Casa de Diseño’s existing operating cycle (OC), cash conversion 
cycle (CCC), and resource investment need?
b. If Leal can optimize Casa de Diseño’s operations according to industry stan￾dards, what will Casa de Diseño’s operating cycle (OC), cash conversion cycle 
(CCC), and resource investment need to be under these more efficient condi￾tions?
c. In terms of resource investment requirements, what is the cost of Casa de 
Diseño’s operational inefficiency?
d. (1) If in addition to achieving industry standards for payables and inventory the 
firm can reduce the average collection period by offering credit terms of 3/10 
net 60, what additional savings in resource investment costs will result from 
the shortened cash conversion cycle, assuming that the level of sales remains 
constant?
(2) If the firm’s sales (all on credit) are $40,000,000 and 45% of the customers 
are expected to take the cash discount, by how much will the firm’s annual 
revenues be reduced as a result of the discount?
(3) If the firm’s variable cost of the $40,000,000 in sales is 80%, determine the 
reduction in the average investment in accounts receivable and the annual 
savings that will result from this reduced investment, assuming that sales re￾main constant.
(4) If the firm’s bad-debts expenses decline from 2% to 1.5% of sales, what an￾nual savings will result, assuming that sales remain constant?
(5) Use your findings in parts (2) through (4) to assess whether offering the cash 
discount can be justified financially. Explain why or why not.
e. On the basis of your analysis in parts a through d, what recommendations would 
you offer Teresa Leal?
f. Review for Teresa Leal the key sources of short-term financing, other than ac￾counts payable, that she may consider for financing Casa de Diseño’s resource 
investment need calculated in part b. Be sure to mention both unsecured and 
secured sources.729
I
t has become a cliché to say that business is becoming more complex and 
more global over time, but, like all clichés, there is a ring of truth in that state￾ment. In this final part, we examine three special topics that are among the most 
challenging and exciting topics in all finance.
Chapter 17 introduces hybrid and derivative securities. A hybrid is a security that 
has characteristics similar to other securities. For example, preferred stock is a 
hybrid because it has some debt-like and some equity-like features. Just as many 
bonds pay a fixed interest rate, preferred stock pays a fixed dividend. However, 
preferred stock is more like equity in that investors who hold preferred shares cannot 
force a firm into bankruptcy if it stops paying preferred dividends. A derivative is a 
security that derives its value from some other security. For example, a call option is 
a derivative because its value increases (decreases) if the stock price increases (de￾creases). Perhaps surprisingly, investors can use derivatives to either speculate on 
price changes in the stock market or to protect themselves against such movements.
Chapter 18 focuses on mergers, leveraged buyouts, and bankruptcy. They are 
three of the biggest “events” that can happen in the life of a corporation, and cer￾tainly most large companies acquire other companies from time to time. Chapter 
18 explains the techniques that firms use to execute various types of mergers and 
acquisitions and highlights the motivations behind those transactions. The chapter 
also discusses a significant event that firms generally want to avoid: business fail￾ure. We discuss the different types and causes of business failures as well as sev￾eral mechanisms that are used to resolve these failures.
Chapter 19 emphasizes global dimensions of financial management, starting with 
an overview of trading blocs and other international institutions that have a signifi￾cant impact on multinational businesses. The chapter offers in-depth coverage of the 
financial risks associated with doing business internationally, especially risks related 
to movements in exchange rates, and the techniques that firms use to manage those 
risks. Finally, Chapter 19 provides a glimpse into the wide range of options 
available to multinational firms for raising money in markets around the world.

Nokia Calls on Convertible 
Bond Market for Help
O
nce the largest manufacturer of cell phones in the 
world, the Finnish company Nokia Corporation failed 
to keep pace with its competitors after the introduction of 
smartphones. While companies like Apple and Samsung 
dominated the smartphone market, Nokia struggled to de￾liver a competitive product. Nokia lost its coveted investment￾grade bond rating in 2011 and continued to draw down on 
its cash reserves.
To refinance some of its outstanding debts that were 
about to mature, Nokia announced in October 2012 that it 
would issue €750 million in convertible bonds. Maturing 
in 2017, these bonds would pay an interest rate of 5 percemt 
on a par value of €1,000. After December 6, 2012, an in￾vestor who held one of these bonds could choose to ex￾change it for 383 shares of Nokia common stock. Naturally, 
investors would only be willing to exchange their bonds for 
stock if the value of the stock that they received was greater 
than the value of the bonds. In other words, the convertible 
bond structure allowed investors to benefit if Nokia stock in￾creased. Because of that potential benefit, investors were will￾ing to accept a lower interest rate on Nokia’s bonds than they 
otherwise would have demanded.
Convertible bonds are one example of a hybrid secu￾rity. Convertibles have some features similar to ordinary 
bonds, such as a fixed principal, periodic interest payments, and a firm maturity date. Convertibles 
also behave a little like stock, however, because investors who hold convertible bonds can earn 
higher returns than ordinary bonds provide if the issuing company’s common stock rises. In this chap￾ter, you’ll learn about convertibles and other hybrid securities used in corporate finance.

 17.1 Overview of hybrids and derivatives
Chapters 6 and 7 described the characteristics of the key securities—corporate 
bonds, common stock, and preferred stock—used by corporations to raise long￾term funds. In their simplest form, bonds are pure debt, and common stock is 
pure equity. Preferred stock, on the other hand, is a form of equity that promises 
to pay fixed periodic dividends that are similar to the fixed contractual interest 
payments on bonds. Because it blends the characteristics of both debt (a fixed 
dividend payment) and equity (ownership), preferred stock is considered a hybrid 
security. Other popular hybrid securities include financial leases, convertible se￾curities, and stock purchase warrants. Each of these hybrid securities is described 
in the sections that follow.
The final section of this chapter focuses on options, a security that is neither 
debt nor equity but derives its value from an underlying asset that is often an￾other security such as a share of common stock. As you’ll learn, derivatives are 
not used by corporations to raise funds but rather serve as a useful tool for man￾aging certain aspects of the firm’s risk.

 17.2 Leasing
Leasing enables the firm to obtain the use of certain fixed assets for which it must 
make a series of contractual, periodic, tax-deductible payments. The lessee is the 
receiver of the services of the assets under the lease contract, and the lessor is the 
owner of the assets. Leasing can take a number of forms.
TYPES OF LEASES
The two basic types of leases that are available to a business are operating leases
and financial leases (often called capital leases by accountants).
Operating Leases
An operating lease is normally a contractual arrangement whereby the lessee 
agrees to make periodic payments to the lessor, often for 5 or fewer years, to ob￾tain an asset’s services. Such leases are generally cancelable at the option of the 
lessee, who may be required to pay a penalty for cancellation. Assets that are 
leased under operating leases have a usable life that is longer than the term of the 
lease. Usually, however, they would become less efficient and technologically 
obsolete if leased for a longer period. Computer systems are prime examples of 
assets whose relative efficiency is expected to diminish as the technology changes. 
The operating lease is therefore a common arrangement for obtaining such sys￾tems, as well as for other relatively short-lived assets such as automobiles.
If an operating lease is held to maturity, the lessee at that time returns the 
leased asset to the lessor, who may lease it again or sell the asset. Normally, the 
asset still has a positive market value at the termination of the lease. In some 
hybrid security
A form of debt or equity 
financing that possesses 
characteristics of both debt 
and equity financing.
derivative security
A security that is neither debt 
nor equity but derives its value 
from an underlying asset that is 
often another security; called 
“derivatives,” for short.

lessee agrees to make periodic 
payments to the lessor, often 
for 5 or fewer years, to obtain

the total payments over the 
term of the lease are less than 
the lessor’s initial cost of the 
leased asset.ChAPTER 17   Hybrid and Derivative Securities 733
instances, the lease contract gives the lessee the opportunity to purchase the 
leased asset. Generally, the total payments made by the lessee to the lessor are less
than the lessor’s initial cost of the leased asset.
Financial (or Capital) Leases
A financial (or capital) lease is a longer-term lease than an operating lease. Finan￾cial leases are noncancelable and obligate the lessee to make payments for the use 
of an asset over a predefined period of time. Financial leases are commonly used 
for leasing land, buildings, and large pieces of equipment. The noncancelable 
feature of the financial lease makes it similar to certain types of long-term debt. 
When a firm leases an asset under a capital lease, the asset appears on the firm’s 
balance sheet and is depreciated over time, almost as if the firm actually owned 
the asset. As with debt, failure to make the contractual lease payments can result 
in bankruptcy for the lessee.
With a financial lease, the total payments over the term of the lease are 
greater than the lessor’s initial cost of the leased asset. In other words, the lessor 
must receive more than the asset’s purchase price to earn its required return on 
the investment. Technically, under FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) 
Statement No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” a financial (or capital) lease is de￾fined as one that has any of the following elements:
 1. The lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the 
lease term.
 2. The lease contains an option to purchase the property at a “bargain price.” 
 3. The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life 
of the property (exceptions exist for property leased toward the end of its us￾able economic life).
 4. At the beginning of the lease, the present value of the lease payments is equal 
to 90 percent or more of the fair market value of the leased property.
The emphasis in this chapter is on financial leases, because they result in inescap￾able long-term financial commitments by the firm.

not have a happy ending.
LEASING ARRANGEMENTS
Lessors use three primary techniques for obtaining assets to be leased. The 
method depends largely on the desires of the prospective lessee.
 1. A direct lease results when a lessor owns or acquires the assets that are leased 
to a given lessee. In other words, the lessee did not previously own the assets 
that it is leasing.
 2. In a sale-leaseback arrangement, lessors acquire leased assets by purchasing 
assets already owned by the lessee and leasing them back. This technique is 
normally initiated by a firm that needs funds for operations. By selling an 
existing asset to a lessor and then leasing it back, the lessee receives cash for 
the asset immediately while obligating itself to make fixed periodic payments 
for use of the leased asset.
 3. Leasing arrangements that include one or more third-party lenders are 
leveraged leases. Under a leveraged lease, the lessor acts as an equity

lessor’s initial cost of the leased 
asset.

that are leased to a given

participant, supplying only about 20 percent of the cost of the asset, and a 
lender supplies the balance. Leveraged leases are especially popular in struc￾turing leases of very expensive assets.
A lease agreement typically specifies whether the lessee is responsible for 
maintenance of the leased assets. Operating leases normally include maintenance 
clauses requiring the lessor to maintain the assets and to make insurance and tax 
payments. Financial leases nearly always require the lessee to pay maintenance 
and other costs.
The lessee is usually given the option to renew a lease at its expiration. 
Renewal options, which grant lessees the right to re-lease assets at expiration, are 
especially common in operating leases because their term is generally shorter than 
the usable life of the leased assets. Purchase options, allowing the lessee to pur￾chase the leased asset at maturity, typically for a prespecified price, are frequently 
included in both operating and financial leases.
The lessor can be one of a number of parties. In operating leases, the lessor is 
likely to be the manufacturer’s leasing subsidiary or an independent leasing com￾pany. Financial leases are frequently handled by independent leasing companies 
or by the leasing subsidiaries of large financial institutions such as commercial 
banks and life insurance companies. Life insurance companies are especially ac￾tive in real estate leasing. Pension funds, like commercial banks, have also been 
increasing their leasing activities.

in both operating and financial 
leases that allow the lessee to

not have a happy ending was Disney’s 
investment in leveraged aircraft leases.
Using a structure known as a lever￾aged lease, cash-rich Disney purchased 
airplanes in the early 1990s and 
leased them out to air carriers. The 
deals, with ironclad terms, were seen 
as safe and offered tax advantages.

Pursuing the matter in the courts, Disney 
was able to recoup $50 million from 
United for its lost tax benefits.
With additional aircraft leased out 
to Delta Air Lines (five aircraft, $119

leases had not reached its final reel. 
Delta Air Lines announced a 7,000 job

bankruptcy in late 2005. At that time,

During the 1990s, leveraged leases 
were attractive investments that boosted

LEASE-VERSuS-PuRChASE dECISION
Firms that are contemplating the acquisition of new fixed assets commonly con￾front the lease-versus-purchase (or lease-versus-buy) decision. The alternatives 
available are (1) lease the assets, (2) borrow funds to purchase the assets, or 
(3) purchase the assets using available liquid resources. Alternatives 2 and 3,
although they differ, are analyzed in a similar fashion; even if the firm has the 
liquid resources with which to purchase the assets, the use of these funds is viewed 
as equivalent to borrowing. Therefore, we need to compare only the leasing and 
purchasing alternatives.
The lease-versus-purchase decision involves application of the capital budg￾eting methods presented in Chapters 10 through 12. First, we determine the rel￾evant cash flows and then we apply present value techniques. The following steps 
are involved in the analysis:
Step 1 Find the after-tax cash outflows for each year under the lease alternative.
This step generally involves a fairly simple tax adjustment of the annual 
lease payments. In addition, the cost of exercising a purchase option in 
the final year of the lease term must frequently be included.1
Step 2 Find the after-tax cash outflows for each year under the purchase alter￾native. This step involves adjusting the sum of the scheduled loan pay￾ment and maintenance cost outlay for the tax shields resulting from the 
tax deductions attributable to maintenance, depreciation, and interest.
Step 3 Calculate the present value of the cash outflows associated with the lease 
(from Step 1) and purchase (from Step 2) alternatives using the after-tax 
cost of debt as the discount rate. The after-tax cost of debt is used to 
evaluate the lease-versus-purchase decision because the decision itself in￾volves the choice between two financing techniques—leasing and 
borrowing—that have very low risk.
Step 4 Choose the alternative with the lower present value of cash outflows 
from Step 3. It will be the least-cost financing alternative.
The application of each of these steps is demonstrated in the following example.
Roberts Company, a small machine shop, is contemplating acquiring a new ma￾chine that costs $24,000. Arrangements can be made to lease or purchase the 
machine. The firm is in the 40% tax bracket.
Lease The firm would obtain a 5-year lease requiring annual end-of-year lease 
payments of $6,000. All maintenance costs would be paid by the lessor, and in￾surance and other costs would be borne by the lessee. The lessee would exercise 
its option to purchase the machine for $1,200 at termination of the lease.2
Example 17.1 ▶
lease-versus-purchase (or 
lease-versus-buy) decision
The decision facing firms 
needing to acquire new fixed 
assets: whether to lease the 
assets or to purchase them, 
using borrowed funds or 
available liquid resources.
1. Including the cost of exercising a purchase option in the cash flows for the lease alternative ensures that under 
both lease and purchase alternatives the firm owns the asset at the end of the relevant time horizon. The other ap￾proach would be to include the cash flows from sale of the asset in the cash flows for the purchase alternative at the 
end of the lease term. These strategies guarantee avoidance of unequal lives, which were discussed in Chapter 12. In 
addition, they make any subsequent cash flows irrelevant because these would be either identical or nonexistent, 
respectively, under each alternative.
2. Lease payments are generally made at the beginning of the year. To simplify the following discussions, end-of￾year lease payments are assumed. We are assuming that the machine’s market value and book value are both $1,200 
at the end of 5 years.736 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
Purchase The firm would finance the purchase of the machine with a 9%, 5-year 
loan requiring end-of-year installment payments of $6,170.3
 The machine would 
be depreciated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. The firm would 
pay $1,500 per year for a service contract that covers all maintenance costs; in￾surance and other costs would be borne by the firm. The firm plans to keep the 
machine and use it beyond its 5-year recovery period.
Using these data, we can apply the steps presented earlier:
Step 1 The after-tax cash outflow from the lease payments can be found by multi￾plying the before-tax payment of $6,000 by 1 minus the tax rate, T, of 40%.
After-tax cash outflow from lease 5 $6,000 3 (1 2 T)
5 $6,000 3 (1 2 0.40) 5 $3,600
Therefore, the lease alternative results in annual cash outflows over the 
5-year lease of $3,600. In the final year, the $1,200 cost of the purchase 
option would be added to the $3,600 lease outflow to get a total cash 
outflow in year 5 of $4,800 ($3,600 1 $1,200).
Step 2 The after-tax cash outflow from the purchase alternative is a bit more 
difficult to find. First, the interest component of each annual loan pay￾ment must be determined because the Internal Revenue Service allows 
the deduction of interest only—not principal—from income for tax pur￾poses.4
 Table 17.1 presents the calculations necessary to split the loan 
3. The annual loan payment on the 9 percent, 5-year loan of $24,000 is calculated by using the loan amortization technique 
described in Chapter 5. To calculate the loan payment in Excel, you would use the “pmt” function, entering into any blank 
cell, 5 pmt(0.09,5,24000,0,0). In the terms inside the parentheses, 0.09 is the interest rate, 5 is the term of the lease in years, 
and 24,000 is the amount being borrowed (or equivalently, the cost of the new machine). The final two zeros inside the 
parentheses tell Excel that after 5 years the loan is totally paid off (zero remaining balance) and that payments are made at the 
end of each year. The exact loan payment is $6,170.22, but in the example we round down to the nearest dollar.
4. When the rate of interest on the loan used to finance the purchase just equals the cost of debt, the present value of 
the after-tax loan payments (annual loan payments 2 interest tax shields) discounted at the after-tax cost of debt 
just equals the initial loan principal. In such a case, it is unnecessary to amortize the loan to determine the payment 
amount and the amounts of interest when finding after-tax cash outflows. The loan payments and interest payments 
(columns 1 and 4 in Table 17.2) can be ignored, and, in their place, the initial loan principal ($24,000) is shown as 
an outflow occurring at time zero. To allow for a loan interest rate that is different from the firm’s cost of debt and 
for easier understanding, here we isolate the loan payments and interest payments rather than use this computation￾ally more efficient approach.

payments into their interest and principal components. Columns 3 and 4 
show the annual interest and principal paid.
In Table 17.2, the annual loan payment is shown in column 1, and the an￾nual maintenance cost, which is a tax-deductible expense, is shown in column 2. 
Next, we find the annual depreciation write-off resulting from the $24,000 ma￾chine. Using the applicable MACRS 5-year recovery period depreciation percent￾ages—20% in year 1, 32% in year 2, 19% in year 3, and 12% in years 4 and 
5—given in Table 4.2 results in the annual depreciation for years 1 through 5 
given in column 3 of Table 17.2.5
Table 17.2 presents the calculations required to determine the cash outflows6
associated with borrowing to purchase the new machine. Column 7 of the table 
presents the after-tax cash outflows associated with the purchase alternative. A 
few points should be clarified with respect to the calculations in Table 17.2. The 
major cash outflows are the total loan payment for each year given in column 1 
and the annual maintenance cost in column 2. The sum of these two outflows is 
reduced by the tax savings from writing off the maintenance, depreciation, and 
interest expenses associated with the new machine and its financing. The result￾ing cash outflows are the after-tax cash outflows associated with the purchase 
alternative.
Step 3 The present values of the cash outflows associated with the lease (from 
Step 1) and purchase (from Step 2) alternatives are calculated in Table 
17.3 using the firm’s 6% after-tax cost of debt.7
 The sum of the present 
values of the cash outflows for the leasing alternative is given in column 
2 of Table 17.3, and the sum of those for the purchasing alternative is 
given in column 4.
5. We are ignoring depreciation in year 6 because regardless of which option the company selects there will be 
$1,200 worth of depreciation remaining.
6. Although other cash outflows such as insurance and operating expenses may be relevant here, they would be the 
same under the lease and purchase alternatives and therefore would cancel out in the final analysis.
7. If we ignore any flotation costs, the firm’s after-tax cost of debt would be 5.4% [9% debt cost 3 (1 2 0.40 tax 
rate)]. To reflect both the flotation costs associated with selling new debt and the possible need to sell the debt at a 
discount, we use an after-tax debt cost of 6% as the applicable discount rate. A more detailed discussion of tech￾niques for calculating the after-tax cost of debt is found in Chapter 9.

Step 4 Because the present value of cash outflows for leasing ($16,062) is lower 
than that for purchasing ($19,541), the leasing alternative is preferred.
Leasing results in an incremental savings of $3,479 ($19,541 2 $16,062) 
and is therefore the less costly alternative.
The techniques described here for comparing lease and purchase alternatives 
may be applied in different ways. The approach illustrated by the Roberts Com￾pany data is one of the most straightforward. It is important to recognize that the 
lower cost of one alternative over the other results from factors such as the differ￾ing tax brackets of the lessor and lessee, different tax treatments of leases versus 
purchases, and differing risks and borrowing costs for lessor and lessee. There￾fore, when making a lease-versus-purchase decision, the firm will find that inex￾pensive borrowing opportunities, high required lessor returns, and a low risk of 
obsolescence increase the attractiveness of purchasing. Subjective factors must 
also be included in the decision-making process. Like most financial decisions, 
the lease-versus-purchase decision requires some judgment or intuition.
Jake Jiminez is considering either leasing or purchasing a new 
Honda Fit that will cost $15,000. The 3-year lease requires an 
initial payment of $1,800 and monthly payments of $300. Purchasing requires a 
$2,500 down payment, sales tax of 5% ($750), and 36 monthly payments of 
$392. He estimates the trade-in value of the new car will be $8,000 at the end of 
3 years. Assuming that Jake can earn 4% annual interest on his savings and is 
subject to a 5% sales tax on purchases, we can make a reasonable recommenda￾tion to Jake using the following analysis (for simplicity, ignoring the time value of 
money).

EFFECTS OF LEASING ON FuTuRE FINANCING
Because leasing is considered a type of financing, it affects the firm’s future fi￾nancing, just as having existing debt has an impact on a firm’s ability to borrow 
even more. Lease payments are shown as a tax-deductible expense on the firm’s 
income statement. Anyone analyzing the firm’s income statement would proba￾bly recognize that an asset is being leased, although the amount and term of the 
lease would be unclear.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), in FASB Statement No. 
13, “Accounting for Leases,” requires explicit disclosure of financial (capital) 
lease obligations on the firm’s balance sheet. Such a lease must be shown as a 
capitalized lease, meaning that the present value of all its payments is included as 
an asset and corresponding liability on the firm’s balance sheet. An operating 
lease, on the other hand, need not be capitalized, but its basic features must be 
disclosed in a footnote to the financial statements. FASB Statement No. 13, of 
course, establishes detailed guidelines to be used in capitalizing leases. Subsequent 
standards have further refined lease capitalization and disclosure procedures.
Jeffrey Company, a manufacturer of water purifiers, is leasing an asset under a 
10-year lease requiring annual end-of-year payments of $15,000. The lease can 
be capitalized merely by calculating the present value of the lease payments over 
the life of the lease. However, the rate at which the payments should be dis￾counted is difficult to determine.8
 If 10% were used, the present, or capitalized, 
value of the lease would be $92,169. This value would be shown as an asset and

8. The Financial Accounting Standards Board in Statement No. 13 established certain guidelines for the appropriate discount 
rate to use when capitalizing leases. Most commonly, the rate that the lessee would have incurred to borrow the funds to buy

corresponding liability on the firm’s balance sheet, which should result in an ac￾curate reflection of the firm’s true financial position.
Because the consequences of missing a financial lease payment are the same as 
those of missing an interest or principal payment on debt, a financial analyst must 
view the lease as a long-term financial commitment of the lessee. With FASB 
Statement No. 13, the inclusion of each financial (capital) lease as an asset and cor￾responding liability (that is, long-term debt) provides for a balance sheet that more 
accurately reflects the firm’s financial status. It thereby permits various types of finan￾cial ratio analyses to be performed directly on the statement by any interested party.
AdVANTAGES ANd dISAdVANTAGES OF LEASING
Leasing has a number of commonly cited advantages and disadvantages that 
managers should consider when making a lease-versus-purchase decision. It is 
not unusual for a number of them to apply in a given situation. Table 17.4 de￾scribes the commonly cited advantages and disadvantages of leasing.
TABLE 17.4 Advantages and Disadvantages of Leasing
Advantages
	 •	The firm may avoid the cost of obsolescence. This 
advantage is especially true in the case of operating leases, 
which generally have relatively short lives.
	 •	A lessee avoids many of the restrictive covenants (such as 
minimum liquidity, subsequent borrowing, and cash dividend 
payments) that are normally included as part of a long-term 
loan but are not normally found in a lease agreement.
	 •	In the case of low-cost assets that are infrequently acquired, 
leasing—especially operating leases—may provide the firm 
with needed financing flexibility. The firm does not have to 
arrange other financing for these assets.
	 •	 Sale-leaseback arrangements may permit the firm to 
increase its liquidity by converting an existing asset into 
cash. This conversion can benefit a firm that is short of 
working capital or in a liquidity bind.
	 •	Leasing allows the lessee, in effect, to depreciate land,
which would be prohibited if the land were purchased. 
Because the lessee who leases land is permitted to deduct 
the total lease payment as an expense for tax purposes, the 
Disadvantages
	 •	In many leases, the return to the lessor is quite high; 
the firm might be better off borrowing to purchase the 
asset.
	 •	The terminal value of an asset, if any, is realized by the 
lessor. If the lessee had purchased the asset, it could have 
claimed its terminal value. Of course, an expected terminal 
value when recognized by the lessor results in lower lease 
payments.
effect is the same as if the firm had purchased the land and 
then depreciated it.
	 •	Because leasing may not increase the assets or liabilities 
on the firm’s balance sheet, leasing may result in mis￾leading financial ratios. Understating assets and 
liabilities can cause certain ratios, such as the total asset 
turnover, to look better than they might be. With the 
adoption of FASB Statement No. 13, this advantage no 
longer applies to financial leases, although it remains a 
potential advantage for operating leases.
	 •	Leasing provides 100 percent financing. Most loan 
agreements for the purchase of fixed assets require a down 
payment; thus the borrower is able to borrow only 90 to 
95 percent of the purchase price of the asset.
	 •	In the case of bankruptcy or reorganization, the maximum 
claim of lessors against the corporation is 3 years of lease 
payments. If debt is used to purchase an asset, the creditors 
have a claim that is equal to the total outstanding loan 
balance.
	 •	The lessee is generally prohibited from making improve￾ments on the leased property or asset without the lessor’s 
approval. However, lessors generally encourage leasehold 
improvements when these are expected to enhance the 
asset’s salvage value.
	 •	 If	a	lessee	leases	an	asset that subsequently becomes obsolete,
it still must make lease payments over the remaining term of 
the lease. This condition is true even if the asset is unusable.ChAPTER 17   Hybrid and Derivative Securities 741

 17.3 Convertible Securities 
A conversion feature is an option that is included as part of a bond or a preferred 
stock issue and allows its holder to change the security into a stated number of 
shares of common stock. The conversion feature typically enhances the market￾ability of an issue.
TYPES OF CONVERTIBLE SECuRITIES
Corporate bonds and preferred stocks may be convertible into common stock. 
The most common type of convertible security is the bond. Convertibles nor￾mally have an accompanying call feature, which permits the issuer to retire or 
encourage conversion of outstanding convertibles when appropriate.
Convertible Bonds
A convertible bond can be changed into a specified number of shares of common 
stock. It is nearly always a debenture—an unsecured bond—with a call feature. 
Because the conversion feature provides the purchaser with the possibility of be￾coming a stockholder on favorable terms, convertible bonds are generally a less 
expensive form of financing than similar-risk nonconvertible or straight bonds.
The conversion feature adds a degree of speculation to a bond issue, although the 
issue still maintains its value as a bond.
Convertible Preferred Stock
Convertible preferred stock is preferred stock that can be changed into a specified 
number of shares of common stock. It can normally be sold with a lower stated 
dividend than a similar-risk nonconvertible or straight preferred stock. The 
reason is that the convertible preferred holder is assured of the fixed dividend 
payment associated with a preferred stock and also may receive the appreciation 
resulting from increases in the market price of the underlying common stock. 
Convertible preferred stock behaves much like convertible bonds. The following 
discussions will concentrate on the more widespread convertible bonds.

GENERAL FEATuRES OF CONVERTIBLES
Convertible securities are nearly always convertible at any time during the life of 
the security. Occasionally, conversion is permitted only for a limited number of 
years, such as for 5 or 10 years after issuance of the convertible.
Conversion Ratio
The conversion ratio is the ratio at which a convertible security can be exchanged 
for common stock. The conversion ratio can be stated in two ways:
 1. Sometimes the conversion ratio is stated in terms of a given number of shares of 
common stock. To find the conversion price, which is the per-share price that is 
effectively paid for common stock as the result of conversion, divide the par 
value (not the market value) of the convertible security by the conversion ratio.
Western Wear Company, a manufacturer of denim products, has a bond 
outstanding that has a $1,000 par value and is convertible into 25 shares of com￾mon stock. The bond’s conversion ratio is 25. The conversion price for the bond 
is $40 per share ($1,000 4 25).
 2. Sometimes, instead of the conversion ratio, the conversion price is given. The 
conversion ratio can be obtained by dividing the par value of the convertible 
by the conversion price.
Mosher Company, a franchiser of seafood restaurants, has outstanding a con￾vertible 20-year bond with a par value of $1,000. The bond is convertible at $50 
per share into common stock. The conversion ratio is 20 ($1,000 4 $50).
The issuer of a convertible security normally establishes a conversion ratio or 
conversion price that sets the conversion price per share at the time of issuance 
above the current market price of the firm’s stock. If the prospective purchasers 
do not expect conversion ever to be feasible, they will purchase a straight security 
or some other convertible issue.
Conversion (or Stock) Value
The conversion (or stock) value is the value of the convertible measured in terms 
of the market price of the common stock into which it can be converted. The 
conversion value can be found simply by multiplying the conversion ratio by the 
current market price of the firm’s common stock.

Matter of fact
W ith the historically low interest rates prevailing at that time, relatively few companies raised 
debt via convertible bonds in 2012. Many companies elected to refinance outstanding 
debts, so more convertibles were retired than issued. Going into 2013, however, bond spreads 
were tight and portions of the corporate bond market were oversold making convertibles more 
attractive. In the first quarter of 2013, firms issued more than $25 billion in convertible securities 
globally, which was more than double the amount during the first quarter of 2012.

McNamara Industries, a petroleum processor, has a $1,000 bond outstanding 
that is convertible into common stock at $62.50 per share. The conversion ratio 
is therefore 16 ($1,000 4 $62.50). Because the current market price of the com￾mon stock is $65 per share, the conversion value is $1,040 (16 3 $65). Because 
the conversion value is above the bond value of $1,000, conversion is a viable 
option for the owner of the convertible security.
Effect on Earnings per Share
The presence of contingent securities, which include convertibles as well as war￾rants and stock options (described later in this chapter), affects the reporting of 
the firm’s earnings per share (EPS). Firms with contingent securities, which if 
converted or exercised would dilute (that is, lower) earnings per share, are re￾quired to report earnings in two ways—basic EPS and diluted EPS.
Basic EPS are calculated without regard to any contingent securities. They 
are found by dividing earnings available for common stockholders by the number 
of shares of common stock outstanding. We use this standard method of 
calculating EPS throughout this book.
Diluted EPS are calculated under the assumption that all contingent securities 
that would have dilutive effects are converted and exercised and are therefore 
common stock. They are found by adjusting basic EPS for the impact of convert￾ing all convertibles and exercising all warrants and options that would have 
dilutive effects on the firm’s earnings. This approach treats as common stock all
contingent securities. It is calculated by dividing earnings available for common 
stockholders (adjusted for interest and preferred stock dividends that would not
be paid, given assumed conversion of all outstanding contingent securities that 
would have dilutive effects) by the number of shares of common stock that would 
be outstanding if all contingent securities that would have dilutive effects were 
converted and exercised. Rather than demonstrate these accounting calculations,9
suffice it to say that firms with outstanding convertibles, warrants, and/or stock 
options must report basic and diluted EPS on their income statements.
FINANCING WITh CONVERTIBLES
Using convertible securities to raise long-term funds can help the firm achieve its 
cost-of-capital and capital structure goals. There also are a number of more spe￾cific motives and considerations involved in evaluating convertible financing.
Motives for Convertible Financing
Convertibles can be used for a variety of reasons. One popular motive is their use 
as a form of deferred common stock financing. When a convertible security is is￾sued, both issuer and purchaser expect the security to be converted into common 
stock at some future point. Because the security is first sold with a conversion 
price above the current market price of the firm’s stock, conversion is initially not 
attractive. The issuer of a convertible could alternatively sell common stock, but 
only at or below its current market price. By selling the convertible, the issuer in

diluted EPS

calculated under the 
assumption that all contingent 
securities that would have 
dilutive effects are converted 
and exercised and are 
therefore common stock.
9. For excellent discussions and demonstrations of the two methods of reporting EPS, see Donald A. Kieso, Jerry J. 
Weygandt, and Terry D. Warfield, Intermediate Accounting, 12th ed. (New York: John Wiley, 2007), pp. 792–805, 
812–816.744 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
effect makes a deferred sale of common stock. As the market price of the firm’s 
common stock rises to a higher level, conversion may occur. Deferring the issu￾ance of new common stock until the market price of the stock has increased 
means that fewer shares will have to be issued, thereby decreasing the dilution of 
both ownership and earnings.
Another motive for convertible financing is its use as a “sweetener” for fi￾nancing. Because the purchaser of the convertible is given the opportunity to be￾come a common stockholder and share in the firm’s future success, convertibles 
can be normally sold with lower interest rates than nonconvertibles. Therefore, 
from the firm’s viewpoint, including a conversion feature reduces the interest cost 
of debt. The purchaser of the issue sacrifices a portion of interest return for the 
potential opportunity to become a common stockholder. Another important mo￾tive for issuing convertibles is that, generally speaking, convertible securities can 
be issued with far fewer restrictive covenants than nonconvertibles. Because many 
investors view convertibles as equity, the covenant issue is not as important to 
them.
A final motive for using convertibles is to raise cheap funds temporarily. By 
using convertible bonds, the firm can temporarily raise debt, which is typically 
less expensive than common stock, to finance projects. Once such projects are 
under way, the firm may wish to shift its capital structure to a less highly lever￾aged position. A conversion feature gives the issuer the opportunity, through ac￾tions of convertible holders, to shift its capital structure at a future time.
Other Considerations
When the price of the firm’s common stock rises above the conversion price, the 
market price of the convertible security will normally rise to a level close to its 
conversion value. When that happens, many convertible holders will not convert 
because they already have the market price benefit obtainable from conversion 
and can still receive fixed periodic interest payments. Because of this behavior, 
virtually all convertible securities have a call feature that enables the issuer to 
encourage or “force” conversion. The call price of the security generally exceeds 
the security’s par value by an amount equal to 1 year’s stated interest on the secu￾rity. Although the issuer must pay a premium for calling a security, the call privi￾lege is generally not exercised until the conversion value of the security is 10 to 15 
percent above the call price. This type of premium above the call price helps to 
assure the issuer that the holders of the convertible will convert it when the call is 
made, instead of accepting the call price.
Unfortunately, there are instances when the market price of a security does 
not reach a level sufficient to stimulate the conversion of associated convertibles. 
A convertible security that cannot be forced into conversion by using the call fea￾ture is called an overhanging issue. An overhanging issue can be quite detrimental 
to a firm. If the firm were to call the issue, the bondholders would accept the call 
price rather than convert the bonds. In this case, the firm not only would have to 
pay the call premium but would also require additional financing to pay off the 
bonds at their par value. If the firm raised these funds through the sale of equity, 
a large number of shares would have to be issued because of their low market 
price, which, in turn, could result in the dilution of existing ownership. Another 
means of financing the call would be the use of debt or preferred stock, but this 
use would leave the firm’s capital structure no less leveraged than before the call.

dETERMINING ThE VALuE OF A CONVERTIBLE BONd
The key characteristic of convertible securities that enhances their marketability 
is their ability to minimize the possibility of a loss while providing a possibility of 
capital gains. Here we discuss the three values of a convertible bond: (1) the 
straight bond value, (2) the conversion value, and (3) the market value.
Straight Bond Value
The straight bond value of a convertible bond is the price at which it would sell 
in the market without the conversion feature. This value is found by determining 
the value of a nonconvertible bond with similar payments issued by a firm with 
the same risk. The straight bond value is typically the floor, or minimum, price at 
which the convertible bond would be traded. The straight bond value equals the 
present value of the bond’s interest and principal payments discounted at the in￾terest rate the firm would have to pay on a nonconvertible bond.
Duncan Company, a southeastern discount store chain, has just sold a $1,000-par￾value, 20-year convertible bond with a 12% coupon interest rate. The bond 
interest will be paid at the end of each year, and the principal will be repaid at 
maturity.10 A straight bond could have been sold with a 14% coupon interest rate, 
so that is the discount rate we use to calculate the straight bond value of Duncan’s 
convertible. The straight bond value of the convertible is calculated as follows:
Example 17.7 ▶
straight bond value
The price at which a 
convertible bond would sell 
in the market without the 
conversion feature.
10. Just as we did in Chapter 6, we continue to assume the payment of annual rather than semiannual bond interest. This as￾sumption simplifies the calculations involved while maintaining the conceptual accuracy of the procedures presented.
Year(s) Payments Present value
1–20 $ 120a $794.78
20 1,000 72.76
  Straight bond value $867.54
a$1,000 at 12% 5 $120 interest per year.
This value, $867.54, is the minimum price at which the convertible bond is ex￾pected to sell. Generally, only in certain instances in which the stock’s market 
price is below the conversion price will the bond be expected to sell at this level.
Conversion (or Stock) Value
Recall that the conversion (or stock) value of a convertible security is the value of 
the convertible measured in terms of the market price of the common stock into 
which the security can be converted. When the market price of the common stock 
exceeds the conversion price, the conversion (or stock) value exceeds the par 
value. An example will clarify the point.
Duncan Company’s convertible bond, described in Example 17.7, is convertible at 
$50 per share. Each bond can be converted into 20 shares because each bond has Example 17.8 ▶746 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
a $1,000 par value. The conversion values of the bond when the stock is selling at 
$30, $40, $50, $60, $70, and $80 per share are shown in the following table:
market premium
The amount by which the 
market value exceeds the 
straight or conversion value 
of a convertible security.
Market price of stock Conversion value
$30 $ 600
40 800
50 (conversion price) 1,000 (par value)
60 1,200
70 1,400
80 1,600
When the market price of the common stock exceeds the $50 conversion 
price, the conversion value exceeds the $1,000 par value. Because the straight 
bond value (calculated in Example 17.7) is $867.54, the bond will, in a stable 
environment, never sell for less than this amount, regardless of how low its con￾version value is. If the market price per share were $30, the bond would still sell 
for $867.54—not $600—because its value as a bond would dominate.
Market Value
The market value of a convertible is likely to be greater than its straight value or 
its conversion value. The amount by which the market value exceeds its straight 
or conversion value is called the market premium. The general relationships 
among the straight bond value, conversion value, market value, and market pre￾mium for Duncan Company’s convertible bond are shown in Figure 17.1. The 
straight bond value acts as a floor for the security’s value up to the point X,

where the stock price is high enough to cause the conversion value to exceed the 
straight bond value. The market premium is attributed to the convertible, giving 
investors a chance to experience attractive capital gains from increases in the 
stock price while taking less risk. The floor (straight bond value) provides protec￾tion against losses resulting from a decline in the stock price caused by falling 
profits or other factors. The market premium tends to be greatest when the 
straight bond value and conversion (or stock) value are nearly equal. Investors 
perceive the benefits of these two sources of value to be greatest at this point.

 17.4 Stock Purchase Warrants
Stock purchase warrants are similar to stock rights, which were briefly described 
in Chapter 7. Stock purchase warrants give their holders the right to purchase a 
certain number of shares of the issuer’s common stock at a specified price over a 
certain period of time. (Of course, holders of warrants earn no income until the 
warrants are exercised or sold.) Warrants also bear some similarity to convert￾ibles in that they provide for the injection of additional equity capital into the 
firm at some future date.
KEY ChARACTERISTICS
Warrants are often attached to debt issues as “sweeteners.” When a firm makes a 
large bond issue, the attachment of stock purchase warrants may add to the 
marketability of the issue and lower the required interest rate. As sweeteners, 
warrants are similar to conversion features. Often, when a new firm is raising its 
initial capital, suppliers of debt will require warrants to permit them to share in 
whatever success the firm achieves. In addition, established companies sometimes 
offer warrants with debt to compensate for risk and thereby lower the interest 
rate and/or provide for fewer restrictive covenants.
Exercise Prices
The price at which holders of warrants can purchase a specified number of shares 
of common stock is normally referred to as the exercise (or option) price. This 
price is usually set at 10 to 20 percent above the market price of the firm’s stock

exercise (or option) price

LG 5748 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
at the time of issuance. Until the market price of the stock exceeds the exercise 
price, holders of warrants will not exercise them because they can purchase the 
stock more inexpensively in the marketplace.
Warrants normally have a life of no more than 10 years, although some have 
infinite lives. Unlike convertible securities, warrants cannot be called, but their 
limited life stimulates holders to exercise their warrants when the exercise price is 
below the market price of the firm’s stock.
Warrant Trading
A warrant is usually detachable, which means that the bondholder may sell the 
warrant without selling the security to which it is attached. Many detachable 
warrants are actively traded in both broker and dealer markets. Many actively 
traded warrants are listed on the American Stock Exchange. Warrants often pro￾vide investors with better opportunities for gain (with increased risk) than the 
underlying common stock.
Comparison of Warrants to Rights and Convertibles
The similarity between a warrant and a right should be clear: Both result in new 
equity capital, although the warrant provides for deferred equity financing. The 
life of a right is typically not more than a few months; a warrant is generally ex￾ercisable for a period of years. Rights are issued at a subscription price below the 
prevailing market price of the stock; warrants are generally issued at an exercise 
price 10 to 20 percent above the prevailing market price.
Warrants and convertibles also have similarities. The exercise of a warrant 
shifts the firm’s capital structure to a less highly leveraged position because new 
common stock is issued without any change in debt. If a convertible bond were 
converted, the reduction in leverage would be even more pronounced because 
common stock would be issued in exchange for a reduction in debt. In addition, 
the exercise of a warrant provides an influx of new capital; with convertibles, the 
new capital is raised when the securities are originally issued rather than when 
they are converted. The influx of new equity capital resulting from the exercise of 
a warrant does not occur until the firm has achieved a certain degree of success 
that is reflected in an increased price for its stock. In this case, the firm conveni￾ently obtains needed funds.
IMPLIEd PRICE OF AN ATTAChEd WARRANT
When warrants are attached to a bond, the implied price of a warrant—the price 
that is effectively paid for each attached warrant—can be found by first using the 
equation
implied price of a warrant
The price effectively paid for 
each warrant attached to a 
bond.

all warrants
=
Price of bond with
warrants attached - Straight bond value (17.1)
The straight bond value is found in a fashion similar to that used in valuing con￾vertible bonds. Dividing the implied price of all warrants by the number of war￾rants attached to each bond results in the implied price of each warrant.ChAPTER 17   Hybrid and Derivative Securities 749
Martin Marine Products, a manufacturer of marine drive shafts and propellers, 
just issued a 10.5%-coupon-interest-rate, $1,000-par, 20-year bond paying an￾nual interest and having 20 warrants attached for the purchase of the firm’s 
stock. The bonds were initially sold for their $1,000 par value. When issued, 
similar-risk straight bonds were selling to yield a 12% rate of return. The straight 
value of the bond would be the present value of its payments discounted at the 
12% yield on similar-risk straight bonds:
Example 17.9 ▶
Year(s) Payments Present value
1–20 $ 105a $784.29
20 1,000 103.67
Straight bond value $887.96
a$1,000 at 10.5% 5 $105 interest per year.
Substituting the $1,000 price of the bond with warrants attached and the 
$887.96 straight bond value into Equation 17.1, we get an implied price of all
warrants of $112.04:
Implied price of all warrants 5 $1,000 2 $887.96 5 $112.04
Dividing the implied price of all warrants by the number of warrants attached to 
each bond—20 in this case—we find the implied price of each warrant:
Implied price of each warrant 5 $112.04 4 20 5 $5.60
Therefore, by purchasing Martin Marine Products’ bond with warrants attached 
for $1,000, one is effectively paying $5.60 for each warrant.
The implied price of each warrant is meaningful only when compared to the 
specific features of the warrant, that is, the number of shares that can be pur￾chased and the specified exercise price. These features can be analyzed in light 
of the prevailing common stock price to estimate the true market value of each 
warrant. Clearly, if the implied price is above the estimated market value, the 
price of the bond with warrants attached may be too high. If the implied price 
is below the estimated market value, the bond may be quite attractive. Firms 
must therefore price their bonds with warrants attached in a way that causes 
the implied price of its warrants to fall slightly below their estimated market 
value. Such an approach allows the firm to sell the bonds more easily at a lower 
coupon interest rate than would apply to straight debt, thereby reducing its 
debt service costs.
VALuES OF WARRANTS
Like a convertible security, a warrant has both a market value and a theoretical 
value. The difference between these values, or the warrant premium, depends 
largely on investor expectations and on the ability of investors to get more lever￾age from the warrants than from the underlying stock.

E 5 exercise price of the warrant
N 5 number of shares of common stock obtainable with one warrant
The use of Equation 17.2 can be illustrated by the following example.
Dustin Electronics, a major producer of transistors, has outstanding warrants 
that are exercisable at $40 per share and entitle holders to purchase three shares 
of common stock. The warrants were initially attached to a bond issue to sweeten 
the bond. The common stock of the firm is currently selling for $45 per share. 
Substituting P0 = $45, E = $40 and N = 3 into Equation 17.2 yields a theoreti￾cal warrant value of ($45 - $40) * 3, or $15.
Market Value of a Warrant
The market value of a stock purchase warrant is generally above the theoretical 
value of the warrant. Only when the theoretical value of the warrant is very high 
or the warrant is near its expiration date are the market and theoretical values 
close. The general relationship between the theoretical and market values of Dus￾tin Electronics’ warrants is presented graphically in Figure 17.2. The market 
value of warrants generally exceeds the theoretical value by the greatest amount 
when the stock’s market price is close to the warrant exercise price per share. The 
amount of time until expiration also affects the market value of the warrant. 
Generally speaking, the closer the warrant is to its expiration date, the more 
likely that its market value will equal its theoretical value.
Warrant Premium
The warrant premium, or the amount by which the market value of Dustin Elec￾tronics’ warrants exceeds the theoretical value of these warrants, is also shown in 
Figure 17.2. This premium results from a combination of positive investor expec￾tations and the ability of the investor with a fixed sum to invest to obtain much 
larger potential returns (and risk) by trading in warrants rather than the underly￾ing stock.
Stan Buyer has $2,430, which he is interested in investing in 
Dustin Electronics. The firm’s stock is currently selling for $45 
per share, and its warrants are selling for $18 per warrant. Each warrant entitles 
the holder to purchase three shares of Dustin’s common stock at $40 per share. 
Because the stock is selling for $45 per share, the theoretical warrant value, cal￾culated in the preceding example, is $15 [($45 - $40) * 3].
Example 17.10 ▶
Personal Finance Example 17.11 ▶ChAPTER 17   Hybrid and Derivative Securities 751
The warrant premium results from positive investor expectations and leverage 
opportunities. Mr. Buyer could spend his $2,430 in either of two ways: He could 
purchase 54 shares of common stock at $45 per share or 135 warrants at $18 per 
warrant, ignoring brokerage fees. If Mr. Buyer purchases the stock and its price 
rises to $48, he will gain $162 ($3 per share 3 54 shares) by selling the stock. If 
instead he purchases the 135 warrants and the stock price increases by $3 per 
share, Mr. Buyer will gain approximately $1,215. Because the price of a share of 
stock rises by $3, the price of each warrant can be expected to rise by $9 (because 
each warrant can be used to purchase three shares of common stock). A gain of $9 
per warrant on 135 warrants means a total gain of $1,215 on the warrants.
The greater leverage associated with trading warrants should be clear from 
the example. Of course, because leverage works both ways, it results in greater 
risk. If the market price fell by $3, the loss on the stock would be $162, whereas 
the loss on the warrants would be close to $1,215. Clearly, investing in warrants 
is more risky than investing in the underlying stock.

 17.5 Options
In the most general sense, an option can be viewed as an instrument that provides 
its holder with an opportunity to purchase or sell a specified asset at a stated 
price on or before a set expiration date. Options are probably the most popular 
type of derivative security. Today, the interest in options centers on options on 
common stock.11 The development of organized options exchanges has created 
markets in which to trade these securities. Three basic forms of options are rights, 
warrants, and calls and puts. Rights are discussed in Chapter 7, and warrants 
were described in the preceding section.
CALLS ANd PuTS
The two most common types of options are calls and puts. A call option is an op￾tion to purchase a specified number of shares of a stock (typically 100) on or before 
a specified future date at a stated price. The stock that the option holder has the 
right to buy is called the underlying asset, and the call option derives its value from 
the value of the underlying stock (hence the term derivative security). Call options 
usually expire in a few months, although some call options have much longer lives. 
The strike price is the price at which the holder of the option can buy a specified 
amount of stock at any time prior to the option’s expiration date. A call option is 
most valuable when its strike price is well below the market price of the underlying 
stock (hence, the option gives the holder the right to buy the stock at a bargain 
price). When the strike price of a call option is less than the market price of the 
stock, the option is said to be in the money. The exchange where the option trades 
generally sets option strike prices at or near the prevailing market price of the stock 
at the time the option is listed for trading. For example, if a firm’s stock is currently 
selling for $50 per share, an option exchange might list option contracts for trading 
with strike prices of $45, $50, and $55. Like other securities, the value of a call op￾tion is determined by the interactions of buyers and sellers trading options in the 
market. A call option’s market price is called the option premium, and it represents 
the price one must pay to acquire the right to buy the stock at the strike price.
A put option is an option to sell a specified number of shares of a stock 
(typically 100) on or before a specified future date at a stated strike price. Like 
the call option, the strike price of the put is set close to the market price of the 
underlying stock at the time of issuance. The lives and costs of puts are similar to 
those of calls. A put option is in the money when the market price of the underly￾ing stock is below the strike price. In that case, the option holder can sell the 
stock at an above-market price.
OPTIONS MARKETS
There are two ways of making options transactions. The first involves making a 
transaction through one of 20 or so call and put options dealers with the help of 
a stockbroker. The other, more popular mechanism is the organized options 
11. Real options—opportunities embedded in capital projects that enable management to alter their cash flows and 
risk—were discussed in Chapter 12. The options described here differ from real options; rather, they are a type of de￾rivative security that derives its value from an underlying financial asset, typically common stock. Although some of the 
analytical tools used to value both types of options are similar, the focus here is merely on the definitional aspects of 
options. The models used to value these options are typically discussed in more advanced financial management texts.

exchanges. The dominant exchange is the Chicago Board Options Exchange 
(CBOE), which was established in 1973. Other exchanges on which options are 
traded include the International Securities Exchange (ISE), the American Stock 
Exchange, and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. The options traded on these 
exchanges are standardized and thus are considered registered securities. Each 
option is for 100 shares of the underlying stock. The price at which options trans￾actions can be made is determined by the forces of supply and demand.
Matter of fact
L
ike most other companies, the Chicago Board Options Exchange saw a decline in its business 
 in 2009 due to the recession. The CBOE reported total options trading volume that year of 
1.135 billion option contracts, down from 1.193 billion in 2008. The steepest decline came in 
an area that had been the CBOE’s fastest growing line of business: options on exchange traded 
funds. ETF option trading fell in 2009 to 277 million contracts, down 16 percent from the prior 
year. ETF option volume did not immediately rebound coming out of the recession, but instead 
declined a bit further in 2010, to 276 million contracts. The rebound came in 2011 and 2012, 
when ETF option volume exceeded 368 million and 311 million contracts, respectively.
Recession Cools Option Trading
OPTIONS TRAdING
The most obvious motive for purchasing call options is the expectation that the 
market price of the underlying stock will rise by more than enough to cover the 
cost of the option, thereby allowing the purchaser of the call to profit.
Assume that Cindy Peters pays $250 for a 3-month call option
on Wing Enterprises, a maker of aircraft components, at a 
strike price of $50. By paying $250, Cindy is guaranteed that she can purchase 
100 shares of Wing at $50 per share at any time during the next 3 months. If 
Wing’s stock price rises above $50, Cindy could exercise her option to buy the 
stock at $50 and then immediately sell it in the open market at the higher market 
price. The stock price must climb $2.50 per share ($250 4 100 shares) to $52.50 
per share to cover the cost of the option (ignoring any brokerage fees). If the 
stock price rises more than that, Cindy earns a net profit from buying and exer￾cising the option. For example, if the stock price were to rise to $60 per share 
during the period, Cindy’s net profit would be $750. She could make a $10 profit 
per share by exercising her right to buy shares at $50 and then immediately sell￾ing them in the open market for $60 each. Because she has the right to buy 100 
shares, Cindy’s gross profit on this transaction would be $1,000, but because she 
spent $250 to acquire the option in the first place, her net profit would be $750.
Because this $750 profit would be earned on a $250 initial investment, it illus￾trates the high potential return on investment that options offer (a 300 percent gain 
in this example). Of course, had the stock price not risen above $50 per share, Cindy 
would have lost the $250 she invested because there would have been no reason to 
exercise the option, and her return on that investment would have been negative 
100%. Had the stock price risen to between $50 and $52.50 per share, Cindy would 
have exercised the option, though the gain from exercising would not have been 
large enough to completely offset the original $250 purchase price of the option.

Put options are often purchased in the expectation that the share price of a 
given security will decline over the life of the option. Investors gain from put op￾tions when the price of the underlying stock declines by more than the per-share 
cost of the option. The logic underlying the purchase of a put is exactly the op￾posite of that underlying the use of call options.
Assume that Don Kelly pays $325 for a 6-month put option
on Dante United, a baked goods manufacturer, at a strike price 
of $40. Don purchased the put option in expectation that the stock price would 
drop because of the introduction of a new product line by Dante’s chief competi￾tor. By paying $325, Don is assured that he can sell 100 shares of Dante at $40 
per share at any time during the next 6 months. If the stock price drops below 
$40, Don can purchase 100 shares at the prevailing market price and then exer￾cise his option to sell them for $40 each. The stock price must drop by $3.25 per 
share ($325 4 100 shares) to $36.75 per share to cover the cost of the 
option (ignoring any brokerage fees). If the stock price falls more than that, Don 
can make a profit from buying and exercising the option. For example, if the 
stock price were to drop to $30 per share during the period, Don could buy 100 
shares on the open market for $3,000 and then exercise his right to sell those 
shares for $40 each (or $4,000 total). Don’s net profit would be $675 
[(100 shares * $40>share) - (100 shares * $30>share) - $325].
Because that $675 return would be earned on only a $325 investment, it il￾lustrates the high potential return on investment that options offer. Of course, 
had the stock price risen above $40 per share, Don would have lost the $325 he 
invested because there would have been no reason to exercise the option. Had the 
stock price fallen to between $36.75 and $40.00 per share, Don would have ex￾ercised the option to reduce his loss to an amount less than $325.
Some investors buy puts not to speculate on a potential price decline but to 
protect themselves from that event. Purchasers of puts commonly own the under￾lying shares, and buying puts provides a way to protect the value of the shares 
that the investor already owns. For example, an investor who owns 100 shares of 
Intel Corp. stock, selling for $22 per share, could buy put options on Intel stock 
with a $20 strike price. This option would guarantee that even if the price of Intel 
stock plummets, the investor would be able to sell her shares for $20 each.
ROLE OF CALL ANd PuT OPTIONS IN FuNd RAISING
Although call and put options are extremely popular investment vehicles, they 
play no direct role in the fund-raising activities of the firm. These options are is￾sued by investors and option exchanges, not businesses. They are not a source of 
financing to the firm because the firm does not receive the proceeds when inves￾tors buy options, nor do firms receive funds when investors exercise options to 
buy shares. Buyers of options have no say in the firm’s management, and they do 
not have voting rights; only stockholders are given these privileges. Despite the 
popularity of options as investments, the financial manager has very little need to 
deal with them, especially as part of fund-raising activities.
However, financial managers do work with stock options when they are part 
of employee compensation packages. Employee stock options are a form of call

options. As the Focus on Ethics box discusses, a number of companies and com￾pany executives have skated close to, or over, the ethical edge with regard to 
backdating of options.
hEdGING FOREIGN-CuRRENCY ExPOSuRES WITh OPTIONS
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange 
(PHLX) offer exchange-traded options contracts on the Canadian dollar, the 
euro, the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, and several other important currencies. 
Currency options are used by a wide range of traders, from the largest 
multinational companies to small exporters and importers, as well as by individual 
investors and speculators. Options allow companies to hedge, which involves 
offsetting or protecting against the risk of adverse price movements, 
Granting stock options 
to executives as well 
as rank-and-file employees was a popu￾lar practice in the technology sector for 
many years. Start-up companies who 
couldn’t afford to pay high salaries 
could offer stock options to employees 
who were willing to take the risk that 
the options would be worth a great 
deal if the company took off. Even tech￾nology giants such as Microsoft and In￾tel routinely granted options to nearly all 
their employees, many of whom be￾came wealthy as tech stocks boomed 
through the 1990s.
Typically, an employee stock option 
has a strike price equal to the market 
price of the company’s stock at the time 
the option is granted. That practice 
ensures that employees make a profit on 
their options only when the stock price 
rises after the options are awarded. 
One way that firms could make their 
stock option grants even more valuable 
to employees is through a practice 
known as backdating. Backdating 
occurs when a firm uses hindsight to 
establish an option grant date at a time 
when the firm’s stock price was at a tem￾porary low point. For example, on April 
1, managers might look back and deter￾mine that the lowest stock price in the 
prior quarter occurred on February 20. 
Managers announce that options were 
granted on February 20 with a strike 
price equal to the stock price at that 
time. Of course, with the benefit of hind￾sight, managers know that the stock 
price on April 1 is much higher than it 
was on February 20, so these “back￾dated” options already have a built-in 
profit. Finance professors Erik Lie of the 
University of Iowa and Randall Heron of 
Indiana University published several stud￾ies showing that the timing of employee 
stock option grants at market low points 
was too widespread to be coincidental, 
so they concluded that many option 
grants had been backdated. The SEC 
subsequently conducted a yearlong 
investigation and began to crack down 
on companies with questionable policies 
governing stock-option grants. At least 
260 companies announced internal 
reviews or have been subject to SEC or 
Justice Department inquiries related to 
options backdating. Firms that were 
investigated saw significant drops in the 
market prices of their shares. As a result 
of the increased scrutiny, a number of 
top-level executives at a variety of com￾panies either resigned or were fired. A 
number of companies announced that 
they would have to issue a restatement 
of prior results to record charges against 
earnings that should have been 
recorded when the options were 
granted.
Although backdating of options is 
not necessarily illegal, the issues relating 
to backdating of options involve failure 
to provide full disclosure to shareholders, 
failure to pay extra applicable taxes, 
and earnings statements that should 
have reflected the modified grant dates. 
Any of these three issues could yield civil 
(and perhaps criminal) legal action.
Fortunately, accelerated reporting 
requirements have made unreported 
backdating more difficult. Section 403 
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
now requires that directors and officers 
report options grants to the SEC within 
2 business days, instead of within 
weeks and months as allowed under 
the prior law.
▶ If firms wanted to grant stock 
options with strike prices below 
the current market price of their 
stock, they could do so. Why do 
you think instead some firms 
chose to backdate options, making 
it appear as though the options 
had been granted with strike 
prices equal to the current stock 
market price when in fact the 
options were in the money at the 
time of the grant?

while simultaneously preserving the possibility of profiting from favorable price 
movements. Using options to hedge risk is similar to purchasing insurance. The 
firm pays a premium (the cost of the option), and in exchange it receives a cash 
inflow if the event that the firm is hedging against actually occurs. If the event 
does not occur, the option expires as worthless, and the money spent to acquire 
the option is lost, just as would be the case if you purchased auto insurance and 
never had an accident.
Assume that a U.S. exporter just booked a sale denominated in Swiss francs with 
payment due upon delivery in 3 months. The exporter is exposed to currency risk 
because when it receives francs in payment, it will sell those francs in exchange 
for dollars, but the exchange rate at which that transaction will occur is un￾known. If the Swiss franc declines in value, the dollar value of the payment that 
the exporter will receive in 3 months is reduced (because each franc buys fewer 
dollars on the foreign exchange market). The company could hedge the risk of 
depreciation in the franc by purchasing a Swiss franc put option, which would 
give the company the right to sell Swiss francs at a fixed price (say, one franc in 
exchange for $1.04). This option would become valuable if the value of the Swiss 
franc was less than $1.04 when the payment in francs arrives in 3 months. On the 
other hand, if one Swiss franc was worth more than $1.04 when the exporter re￾ceived payment, the firm would allow the put option to expire unexercised and 
would instead convert the Swiss francs received in payment into dollars at the 
new, higher dollar price. The exporter would be protected from adverse price risk 
but would still be able to profit from favorable price movements.

Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
In addition to basic corporate securities like stocks and bonds, the firm can use 
hybrid securities in its fund-raising activities. These securities, which possess 
characteristics of both debt and equity, enable the firm to raise funds at less cost 
or to provide for desired future changes in the firm’s capital structure.
Leasing, particularly financial (capital) leases, may enable the firm to use 
the lease as a substitute for the debt-financed purchase of an asset, with more 
attractive risk–return trade-offs. Similarly, by issuing convertible rather than 
straight debt or by attaching stock purchase warrants to a bond issue or debt 
financing, the firm may provide lenders with the potential to benefit from stock 
price movements in exchange for a lower interest rate or less restrictive cove￾nants in the bond or debt agreement. Although options are not a source of ChAPTER 17   Hybrid and Derivative Securities 757
financing to the firm, this derivative security can help provide incentives to em￾ployees. Currency options can be used to hedge adverse currency movements in 
international transactions.
Clearly, the financial manager should use hybrid and derivative securities to 
increase return (often by lowering financing costs) and reduce risk. By taking 
only those actions believed to result in attractive risk–return trade-offs, the fi￾nancial manager can positively contribute to the firm’s goal of maximizing the 
stock price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Differentiate between hybrid and derivative securities and their roles in the 
corporation. Hybrid securities are forms of debt or equity financing that possess 
characteristics of both debt and equity. Common hybrid securities include pre￾ferred stock, financial leases, convertible securities, and stock purchase warrants. 
Derivative securities are neither debt nor equity and derive their value from an 
underlying asset that is often another security. Options are a popular derivative 
security.
Review the types of leases, leasing arrangements, the lease-versus-pur￾chase decision, the effects of leasing on future financing, and the advantages and 
disadvantages of leasing. A lease enables the firm to make contractual, tax￾deductible payments to obtain the use of fixed assets. Operating leases are gen￾erally 5 or fewer years in term, cancelable, and renewable, and they provide for 
maintenance by the lessor. Financial leases are longer term, noncancelable, and 
not renewable, and they nearly always require the lessee to maintain the asset. 
FASB Statement No. 13 provides specific guidelines for defining a financial (cap￾ital) lease. A lessor can obtain assets to be leased through a direct lease, a sale￾leaseback arrangement, or a leveraged lease. The lease-versus-purchase decision 
can be evaluated by calculating the after-tax cash outflows associated with the 
leasing and purchasing alternatives. The more desirable alternative is the one 
that has the lower present value of after-tax cash outflows. FASB Statement No. 
13 requires firms to show financial leases as assets and corresponding liabilities 
on their balance sheets; operating leases must be shown in footnotes to the fi￾nancial statements. Advantages and disadvantages should be considered when 
making lease-versus-purchase decisions.
Describe the types of convertible securities, their general features, and 
financing with convertibles. Corporate bonds and preferred stock may both be 
convertible into common stock. The conversion ratio indicates the number of 
shares for which a convertible can be exchanged and determines the conversion 
price. A conversion privilege is nearly always available at any time in the life of 
the security. The conversion value is the value of the convertible measured in 
terms of the market price of the common stock into which it can be converted. 
The presence of convertibles and other contingent securities (warrants and stock 
options) often requires the firm to report both basic and diluted earnings per 
share (EPS). Convertibles are used to obtain deferred common stock financing, 
to “sweeten” bond issues, to minimize restrictive covenants, and to raise cheap 
funds temporarily. The call feature is sometimes used to encourage or “force” 
conversion; occasionally, an overhanging issue results.

Demonstrate the procedures for determining the straight bond value, the 
conversion (or stock) value, and the market value of a convertible bond. The 
straight bond value of a convertible is the price at which it would sell in the 
market without the conversion feature. It typically represents the minimum 
value at which a convertible bond trades. The conversion value is found by mul￾tiplying the conversion ratio by the current market price of the underlying com￾mon stock. The market value of a convertible generally exceeds both its straight 
and conversion values, resulting in a market premium. The premium is largest 
when the straight and conversion values are nearly equal.
Explain the key characteristics of stock purchase warrants, the implied 
price of an attached warrant, and the values of warrants. Stock purchase war￾rants enable their holders to purchase a certain number of shares of common 
stock at the specified exercise price. Warrants are often attached to debt issues 
as “sweeteners,” generally have limited lives, are detachable, and may be traded 
in broker and dealer markets. Warrants are similar to stock rights except that 
the exercise price of a warrant is initially set above the underlying stock’s cur￾rent market price. Warrants are similar to convertibles, but exercising them has 
a less pronounced effect on the firm’s leverage and brings in new funds. The 
implied price of an attached warrant can be found by dividing the difference 
between the bond price with warrants attached and the straight bond value by 
the number of warrants attached to each bond. The market value of a warrant 
usually exceeds its theoretical value, creating a warrant premium. Investors 
generally get more leverage from trading warrants than from trading the un￾derlying stock.
Define options, and discuss calls and puts, options markets, options 
trading, the role of call and put options in fund raising, and hedging foreign￾currency exposures with options. An option provides its holder with an oppor￾tunity to purchase or sell a specified asset at a stated price on or before a set 
expiration date. Rights, warrants, and calls and puts are all options. Calls are 
options to purchase common stock, and puts are options to sell common stock. 
Options exchanges provide organized marketplaces in which purchases and 
sales of call and put options can be made. The options traded on the exchanges 
are standardized, and the prices at which they trade are determined by the 
forces of supply and demand. Call and put options do not play a direct role in 
the fund-raising activities of the financial manager. Currency options can be 
used to hedge the firm’s foreign-currency exposures resulting from international 
transactions.

 P17–4 Lease versus purchase JLB Corporation is attempting to determine whether to lease or 
purchase research equipment. The firm is in the 40% tax bracket, and its after-tax 
cost of debt is currently 8%. The terms of the lease and of the purchase are as follows:
Lease Annual end-of-year lease payments of $25,200 are required over the 
3-year life of the lease. All maintenance costs will be paid by the lessor; insurance 
and other costs will be borne by the lessee. The lessee will exercise its option to 
purchase the asset for $5,000 at termination of the lease.
Purchase The research equipment, costing $60,000, can be financed entirely with 
a 14% loan requiring annual end-of-year payments of $25,844 for 3 years. The 
firm in this case will depreciate the equipment under MACRS using a 3-year re￾covery period. (See Table 4.2 on page 166 for the applicable depreciation per￾centages.) The firm will pay $1,800 per year for a service contract that covers all 
maintenance costs; insurance and other costs will be borne by the firm. The firm 
plans to keep the equipment and use it beyond its 3-year recovery period.

Spreadsheet Exercise
 Morris Company, a small manufacturing firm, wants to acquire a new machine that 
costs $30,000. Arrangements can be made to lease or purchase the machine. The firm 
is in the 40% tax bracket. The firm has gathered the following information about the 
two alternatives:
Lease Morris would obtain a 5-year lease requiring annual end-of-year lease 
payments of $10,000. The lessor would pay all maintenance costs; insurance 
and other costs would be borne by the lessee. Morris would be given the right 
to exercise its option to purchase the machine for $3,000 at the end of the 
lease term.
Purchase Morris can finance the purchase of the machine with an 8.5%, 
5-year loan requiring annual end-of-year installment payments. The machine 
would be depreciated under MACRS using a 5-year recovery period. The ex￾act depreciation rates over the next six periods would be 20%, 32%, 19%, 
12%, 12%, and 5%, respectively. Morris would pay $1,200 per year for a 
service contract that covers all maintenance costs. The firm plans to keep the 
machine and use it beyond its 5-year recovery period.
TO dO
Create a spreadsheet similar to Tables 17.1, 17.2, and 17.3 to answer the following:
a. Calculate the after-tax cash outflow from the lease for Morris Company.
b. Calculate the annual loan payment.
c. Determine the interest and principal components of the loan payments.
d. Calculate the after-tax cash outflows associated with the purchasing option.

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
Accounting You need to understand mergers, leveraged buyouts, and dives￾titures of assets to record and report these organizational changes; you also need 
to understand bankruptcy procedures because you will play a large part in any 
reorganization or liquidation.
informAtion SYStemS You need to understand what data must be tracked in 
the case of mergers, leveraged buyouts, divestitures of assets, or bankruptcy so 
as to devise the systems needed to effect these organizational changes.
mAnAgement You need to understand the motives for mergers so that you will 
know when and why a merger is a good idea. Also, you may need to know how 
to fend off an unwelcome takeover attempt, when to divest the firm of assets for 
strategic reasons, and what options are available in the case of business failure.
mArketing You need to understand mergers and divestitures, which may 
enable the firm to grow, diversify, or achieve synergy and therefore require 
changes in the firm’s marketing organization, plans, and goals.
operAtionS You need to understand mergers and divestitures because ongo￾ing operations will be significantly affected by these organizational changes. 
Also, you should know that business failure may result in reorganization of the 
firm to provide adequate financing for ongoing operations.
In your personal life As an investor, you should understand corpo￾rate mergers, leveraged buyouts, and divesti￾tures. more important, though, is an understanding of the causes and remedies 
associated with corporate bankruptcy. clearly, an unstated personal financial 
goal is to avoid bankruptcy, an outcome that those who develop and implement 
reasonable personal financial plans are not likely to experience.

Dell Fight for Computer Maker
F
ounded in 1984 by a 19-year-old college 
dropout, Dell was one of the largest and 
best-known computer manufacturers during the 
1990s. In March 2000, just before the “technol￾ogy bubble” burst, Dell’s stock price hit an all-time 
high of almost $59 per share, making the compa￾ny’s shareholders very happy and the founder, 
Michael Dell, one of the world’s richest men. Dell’s 
fortunes were changing, however. As consumers 
began to spend less on new computers and more 
on smartphones and other mobile devices such as tablets, Dell was slow to innovate, and its 
products lagged market trends. By November 2012, the stock price had lost almost 85 percent 
of its value, falling all the way to $9 per share.
By late 2012, Michael Dell thought that he had a solution to his company’s woes. Along with 
the private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, he planned to take the company private in a transaction 
known as a leveraged buyout (LBO). In a typical LBO, a small group of investors invest their own 
money as well as substantial funds borrowed from banks and other lenders to buy up a company’s 
outstanding shares, usually at a price that reflects a premium above the current stock price. In its bid 
for Dell shares, Silver Lake made a sequence of offers, starting at $11.22 per share and rising to 
$13.65 by February 2013. Some shareholders, though, believed that Michael Dell was trying to 
buy the stock at a bargain price. Among them was the famous “corporate raider” Carl Icahn, who 
aggressively bought Dell shares while the company was forming its plans to go private. Icahn accu￾mulated more than $2 billion worth of Dell stock, becoming its largest stockholder in the process. 
Icahn proposed a new slate of directors to replace Dell’s existing board, and he argued that the firm 
should bring a tender offer to repurchase more than one billion of its own shares at $14 each. Mi￾chael Dell countered that Icahn’s offer was risky and would jeopardize the company’s future.
The colorful battle between Michael Dell and Carl Icahn is not unusual. When companies 
get into trouble, especially when a longtime founder is in charge, disagreements arise about how to 
move forward, and outside investors may attempt to gain control of the firm. The firm’s board of 
directors has a duty to act in the interests of shareholders when a takeover contest occurs, but it is 
not always clear what action is in the shareholders’ best interest. In this case, shareholders would 
receive a premium from Michael Dell and Silver Lake if the company went private, but Icahn 
believed that under his leadership the company’s stock price would go even higher.

 18.1 Merger Fundamentals
Firms sometimes use mergers to expand externally by acquiring control of an￾other firm. Whereas the overriding objective for a merger should be to improve 
the firm’s share value, a number of more immediate motivations such as diversi￾fication, tax considerations, and increasing owner liquidity frequently exist. 
Sometimes mergers are pursued to acquire specific assets owned by the target 
rather than by a desire to run the target as a going concern. Here we discuss 
merger fundamentals: terminology, motives, and types. In the following sections, 
we will describe the related topics of leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and divestitures 
and will review the procedures used to analyze and negotiate mergers.
TERMINOLOGY
In the broadest sense, activities involving expansion or contraction of a firm’s 
operations or changes in its asset or financial (ownership) structure are called 
corporate restructuring. The topics addressed in this chapter—mergers, LBOs, 
and divestitures—are some of the most common forms of corporate restructur￾ing. Here, we define some basic merger terminology; other terms are introduced 
and defined as needed in subsequent discussions.
Mergers, Consolidations, and holding Companies
A merger occurs when two or more firms are combined and the resulting firm 
maintains the identity of one of the firms. Usually, the assets and liabilities of the 
smaller firm are merged into those of the larger firm. Consolidation, by contrast, 
involves the combination of two or more firms to form a completely new corpo￾ration. The new corporation normally absorbs the assets and liabilities of the 
companies from which it is formed. Because of the similarity of mergers and con￾solidations, we use the term merger throughout this chapter to refer to both.
A holding company is a corporation that has voting control of one or more 
other corporations. The companies controlled by a holding company are nor￾mally referred to as its subsidiaries. Control of a subsidiary is typically obtained 
by purchasing a sufficient number of shares of its stock, usually 50% or more, 
although sometimes control of a large, widely held company can be obtained 
with an ownership stake much lower than 50%.
Acquiring versus Target Companies
The firm in a merger transaction that attempts to acquire another firm is com￾monly called the acquiring company. The firm that the acquiring company is 
pursuing is referred to as the target company. Generally, the acquiring company 
identifies, evaluates, and negotiates with the management and/or shareholders of 
the target company. Occasionally, the management of a target company initiates 
its acquisition by seeking out potential acquirers.
Friendly versus hostile Takeovers
Mergers can occur on either a friendly or a hostile basis. Typically, after identify￾ing the target company, the acquirer initiates discussions. If the target manage￾ment is receptive to the acquirer’s proposal, it may endorse the merger and

recommend shareholder approval. If the stockholders approve the merger, the 
transaction is typically consummated either through a cash purchase of shares by 
the acquirer or through an exchange of the acquirer’s stock, or some combination 
of stock and cash for the target firm’s shares. This type of negotiated transaction 
is known as a friendly merger.
If the takeover target’s management does not support the proposed takeover, 
it can fight the acquirer’s actions. In this case, the acquirer can attempt to gain 
control of the firm by buying sufficient shares of the target firm in the market￾place. This move is typically accomplished by using a tender offer, which, as 
noted in Chapter 14, is a formal offer to purchase a given number of shares at a 
specified price. This type of unfriendly transaction is commonly referred to as a 
hostile merger. Clearly, hostile mergers are more difficult to consummate because 
the target firm’s management acts to deter rather than facilitate the acquisition. 
Regardless, hostile takeovers are sometimes successful.
Strategic versus Financial Mergers
Mergers are undertaken for either strategic or financial reasons. Strategic mergers
seek to achieve various economies of scale by eliminating redundant functions, 
increasing market share, improving raw material sourcing and finished product 
distribution, and so on.1
 In these mergers, the operations of the acquiring and 
target firms are combined to achieve synergies, thereby causing the performance 
of the merged firm to exceed that of the premerged firms. The mergers of Intel 
and McAfee (both high-tech firms) and Norwest and Wells Fargo (both banks) 
are examples of strategic mergers. An interesting variation of the strategic merger 
involves the purchase of specific product lines (rather than the whole company) 
for strategic reasons. The acquisition of HarperCollins’s college publishing divi￾sion by Addison-Wesley is an example of such a merger.
Financial mergers are based on the acquisition of companies that can be 
restructured to improve their cash flow. These mergers involve the acquisition of 
the target firm by an acquirer, which may be another company or a group of in￾vestors that may even include the target firm’s existing management. The objective 
of the acquirer is to cut costs drastically and sell off certain unproductive or non￾compatible assets in an effort to increase the target firm’s cash flow. The in￾creased cash flow is used to service the sizable debt that is typically incurred to 
finance these transactions. Financial mergers are based not on the firm’s ability to 
achieve economies of scale but rather on the acquirer’s belief that through 
restructuring, the firm’s unrealized value can be unlocked.
The ready availability of junk bond financing throughout the 1980s fueled 
the financial merger mania during that period. With the collapse of the junk bond 
market in the early 1990s, the bankruptcy filings of a number of prominent 
financial mergers of the 1980s, and the rising stock market of the later 1990s, fi￾nancial mergers lost their luster. As a result, the strategic merger, which does not 
rely so heavily on debt, continues to dominate today.

1. A somewhat similar nonmerger arrangement is the strategic alliance, an agreement typically between a large com￾pany with established products and channels of distribution and an emerging technology company with a promising 
research and development program in areas of interest to the larger company. In exchange for its financial support, 
the larger, established company obtains a stake in the technology being developed by the emerging company. Today, 
strategic alliances are commonplace in the biotechnology, information technology, and software industries.772 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
MOTIVES FOR MERGING
Firms merge to fulfill certain objectives. The overriding goal for merging is maxi￾mization of the owners’ wealth as reflected in the acquirer’s share price. More 
specific motives include growth or diversification, synergy, fund raising, increased 
managerial skill or technology, tax considerations, increased ownership liquidity, 
and defense against takeover. These motives should be pursued when they lead to 
owner wealth maximization.
Growth or diversification
Companies that desire rapid growth in size or market share or diversification in the 
range of their products may find that a merger can fulfill this objective. Instead of 
relying entirely on internal or “organic” growth, the firm may achieve its growth 
or diversification objectives much faster by merging with an existing firm. Such a 
strategy is often less costly than the alternative of developing the necessary produc￾tion capacity. If a firm that wants to expand operations can find a suitable going 
concern, it may avoid many of the risks associated with the design, manufacture, 
and sale of additional or new products. Moreover, when a firm expands or extends 
its product line by acquiring another firm, it may remove a potential competitor.
Synergy
The synergy of mergers is the economies of scale resulting from the merged firms’ 
lower overhead. These economies of scale from lowering the combined overhead 
increase earnings to a level greater than the sum of the earnings of each of the 
independent firms. Synergy is most obvious when firms merge with other firms in 
the same line of business because many redundant functions and employees can 
be eliminated. Staff functions, such as purchasing and sales, are probably most 
greatly affected by this type of combination.
Fund Raising
Often, firms combine to enhance their fund-raising ability. A firm may be unable to 
obtain funds for its own internal expansion but able to obtain funds for external 
business combinations. Quite often, one firm may combine with another that has 
high liquid assets and low levels of liabilities. The acquisition of this type of “cash￾rich” company immediately increases the firm’s borrowing power by decreasing its 
financial leverage, which should allow funds to be raised externally at lower cost.
Increased Managerial Skill or Technology
Occasionally, a firm will have good potential that it finds itself unable to develop 
fully because of deficiencies in certain areas of management or an absence of 
needed product or production technology. If the firm cannot hire the manage￾ment or develop the technology it needs, it might combine with a compatible firm 
that has the needed managerial personnel or technical expertise. Of course, any 
merger should contribute to maximizing the owners’ wealth.
Tax Considerations
Quite often, tax considerations are a key motive for merging. In such a case, the 
tax benefit generally stems from one of the firms having a tax loss carryforward. 
In other words, the company’s tax loss can be applied against a limited amount 
Matter of fact

ertain legal constraints on 
mergers and acquisitions 
exist, especially when a pro￾posed acquisition will lead to 
reduced competition. The vari￾ous antitrust laws, which are 
enforced by the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC) and the Jus￾tice Department, prohibit busi￾ness combinations that elimi￾nate competition.

of the firms that can be applied

comes first.ChAPTER 18   Mergers, LBOs, Divestitures, and Business Failure 773
of future income of the merged firm over 20 years or until the total tax loss has 
been fully recovered, whichever comes first.2
 Two situations could actually exist. 
A company with a tax loss could acquire a profitable company to use the tax loss. 
In this case, the acquiring firm would boost the combination’s after-tax earnings 
by reducing the taxable income of the acquired firm. A tax loss may also be use￾ful when a profitable firm acquires a firm that has such a loss. In either situation, 
however, the merger must be justified not only on the basis of the tax benefits but 
also on grounds consistent with the goal of owner wealth maximization. More￾over, the tax benefits described can be used only in mergers—not in the forma￾tion of holding companies—because only in the case of mergers are operating 
results reported on a consolidated basis. An example will clarify the use of the tax 
loss carryforward.
Bergen Company, a wheel bearing manufacturer, has a total of $450,000 in tax 
loss carryforwards resulting from operating tax losses of $150,000 per year in 
each of the past 3 years. To use these losses and to diversify its operations, Hud￾son Company, a molder of plastics, has acquired Bergen through a merger. 
Hudson expects to have earnings before taxes of $300,000 per year. We assume 
that these earnings are realized, that they fall within the annual limit that is le￾gally allowed for application of the tax loss carryforward resulting from the 
merger (see footnote 2), that the Bergen portion of the merged firm just breaks 
even, and that Hudson is in the 40% tax bracket. The total taxes paid by the 
two firms and their after-tax earnings without and with the merger are as shown 
in Table 18.1.
Example 18.1 ▶
2. To deter firms from combining solely to take advantage of tax loss carryforwards, the Tax Reform Act of 1986
imposed an annual limit on the amount of taxable income against which such losses can be applied. The annual limit 
is determined by formula and is tied to the value of the loss corporation before the combination. Although not fully 
eliminating this motive for combination, the act makes it more difficult for firms to justify combinations solely on 
the basis of tax loss carryforwards.

With the merger, the total tax payments are less: $180,000 (total of line 7) 
versus $360,000 (total of line 2). With the merger, the total after-tax earnings are 
more: $720,000 (total of line 8) versus $540,000 (total of line 3). The merged 
firm is able to deduct the tax loss over 20 years or until the total tax loss is fully 
recovered, whichever comes first. In this example, the total tax loss is fully de￾ducted by the end of year 2.
Increased Ownership Liquidity
The merger of two small firms or of a small and a larger firm may provide the 
owners of the small firm(s) with greater liquidity due to the higher marketability 
associated with the shares of larger firms. Instead of holding shares in a small 
firm that has a very “thin” market, the owners will receive shares that are traded 
in a broader market and can thus be liquidated more readily. Also, owning shares 
for which market price quotations are readily available provides owners with a 
better sense of the value of their holdings. Especially in the case of small, closely 
held firms, the improved liquidity of ownership obtainable through a merger 
with an acceptable firm may have considerable appeal.
defense against Takeover
Occasionally, when a firm becomes the target of an unfriendly takeover, it will 
acquire another company as a defensive tactic. Typically, in such a strategy, the 
original target firm takes on additional debt to finance its defensive acquisition; 
because of the debt load, the target firm becomes too highly leveraged financially 
to be of any further interest to its suitor. To be effective, a defensive takeover 
must create greater value for shareholders than they would have realized had the 
firm been merged with its suitor.
TYPES OF MERGERS
The four types of mergers are the (1) horizontal merger, (2) vertical merger, (3) con￾generic merger, and (4) conglomerate merger. A horizontal merger results when two 
firms in the same line of business are merged. An example is the merger of two ma￾chine tool manufacturers. This form of merger results in the expansion of a firm’s 
operations in a given product line and at the same time eliminates a competitor. A 
vertical merger occurs when a firm acquires a supplier or a customer. For example, 
the merger of a machine tool manufacturer with its supplier of castings is a vertical 
merger. The economic benefit of a vertical merger stems from the firm’s increased 
control over the acquisition of raw materials or the distribution of finished goods.
A congeneric merger is achieved by acquiring a firm that is in the same gen￾eral industry but is neither in the same line of business nor a supplier or customer. 
An example is the merger of a machine tool manufacturer with the manufacturer 
of industrial conveyor systems. The benefit of a congeneric merger is the resulting 
ability to use the same sales and distribution channels to reach customers of both 
businesses. A conglomerate merger involves the combination of firms in unre￾lated businesses. The merger of a machine tool manufacturer with a chain of fast￾food restaurants is an example of this kind of merger. The key benefit of the 
conglomerate merger is its ability to reduce risk by merging firms that have differ￾ent seasonal or cyclic patterns of sales and earnings.

 18.2 LBOs and divestitures
Before we address the mechanics of merger analysis and negotiation, you need to 
understand two topics that are closely related to mergers: leveraged buyouts 
(LBOs) and divestitures. An LBO is a method of structuring an acquisition, and 
divestitures involve the sale of a firm’s assets.
LEVERAGEd BuYOuTS (LBOs)
A popular technique that was widely used during the 1980s to make acquisitions 
is the leveraged buyout (LBO), which involves the use of a large amount of debt 
to purchase a firm. LBOs are a clear-cut example of a financial merger under￾taken to create a high-debt private corporation with improved cash flow and 
value. Typically, in an LBO, 90 percent or more of the purchase price is financed 
with debt. A large part of the borrowing is secured by the acquired firm’s assets, 
and the lenders, because of the high risk, take a portion of the firm’s equity. Junk 
bonds have been routinely used to raise the large amounts of debt needed to fi￾nance LBO transactions. Of course, the purchasers in an LBO expect to use the 
improved cash flow to service the large amount of junk bond and other debt in￾curred in the buyout.
An attractive candidate for acquisition via a leveraged buyout should possess 
three key attributes:
 1. It must have a good position in its industry, with a solid profit history and 
reasonable expectations of growth.
 2. The firm should have a relatively low level of debt and a high level of “bank￾able” assets that can be used as loan collateral.
 3. It must have stable and predictable cash flows that are adequate to meet in￾terest and principal payments on the debt and provide adequate working 
capital.
Of course, a willingness on the part of existing ownership and management to 
sell the company on a leveraged basis is also needed.
Many LBOs did not live up to original expectations. One of the largest ever 
was the late 1988, $24.5 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco by KKR. RJR was taken 
public in 1991, and the firm continued to struggle under the heavy debt of the 
LBO for a few years before improving its debt position and credit rating. Campeau

LG 2776 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
Corporation’s buyouts of Allied Stores and Federated Department Stores resulted 
in its later filing for bankruptcy protection, from which reorganized companies 
later emerged. In earlier years, other highly publicized LBOs have defaulted on 
the high-yield debt incurred to finance the buyout. Although the LBO remains a 
viable financing technique under the right circumstances, its use is greatly dimin￾ished from the frenzied pace of the 1980s. Whereas the LBOs of the 1980s were 
used, often indiscriminately, for hostile takeovers, today LBOs are most often 
used to finance management buyouts.
dIVESTITuRES
Companies often achieve external expansion by acquiring an operating unit—
plant, division, product line, subsidiary, and so on—of another company. In such 
a case, the seller generally believes that the value of the firm will be enhanced by 
converting the unit into cash or some other more productive asset. The selling of 
some of a firm’s assets is called divestiture. Unlike business failure, divestiture is 
often undertaken for positive motives: to generate cash for expansion of other 
product lines, to get rid of a poorly performing operation, to streamline the cor￾poration, or to restructure the corporation’s business in a manner consistent with 
its strategic goals.
A personal finance decision that young families with children 
frequently face is whether a stay-at-home parent should “di￾vest” his or her child-care duties, hire child care, and return to work. Whereas the 
emotional aspects of such a decision are nonquantifiable, the economics of such a 
decision are measurable.
Take the case of Elena and Gino Deluca, who have two children, ages 2 and 4. 
They are in the process of analyzing whether it makes economic sense to hire child 
care and have Elena return to work as a credit analyst. They estimate that Elena 
will earn $5,800 per month gross, including her employer’s 401(k) contributions. 
In addition, she expects to receive monthly employer-paid benefits that include 
health insurance, life insurance, and pension contributions totaling $1,800. She 
expects her federal and state income taxes to total about $1,900 per month. The 
Delucas estimate total additional expenses (child care, clothing and personal ex￾penses, meals away from home, and transportation) related to Elana’s job to total 
$1,500 per month. They summarized these monthly estimates as follows:
Additional gross income $5,800
1 Employer-paid benefits 1,800
(1) Additional income and benefits $7,600
Additional taxes 1,900
1 Additional expenses 1,500
(2) Additional taxes and expenses 3,400
Net income (loss) [(1) 2 (2)] $4,200
Because the Delucas will increase their net income by $4,200 per month, having 
Elena divest her child-care responsibilities and hire child care is economically 
justifiable.

Firms divest themselves of operating units by a variety of methods. One in￾volves the sale of a product line to another firm. An example is Paramount’s sale 
of Simon and Schuster to Pearson PLC to free up cash and allow Paramount to 
focus its business better on global mass consumer markets. Outright sales of op￾erating units can be accomplished on a cash or stock swap basis via the proce￾dures described later in this chapter. A second method that has become popular 
involves the sale of the unit to existing management. This sale is often achieved 
through the use of a leveraged buyout (LBO).
Sometimes divestiture is achieved through a spin-off, which results in an op￾erating unit becoming an independent company. A spin-off is accomplished by 
issuing shares in the divested operating unit on a pro rata basis to the parent 
company’s shareholders. Such an action allows the unit to be separated from the 
corporation and to trade as a separate entity. An example was the decision by 
AT&T to spin off its Global Information Solutions unit (formerly and now NCR, 
which produces electronic terminals and computers), to allow AT&T to focus 
better on its core communications business. Like outright sale, this approach 
achieves the divestiture objective, although it does not bring additional cash or 
stock to the parent company. The final and least popular approach to divestiture 
involves liquidation of the operating unit’s individual assets.
Regardless of the method used to divest a firm of an unwanted operating 
unit, the goal typically is to create a more lean and focused operation that will 
enhance the efficiency as well as the profitability of the enterprise and create 
maximum value for shareholders. Recent divestitures seem to suggest that 
many operating units are worth much more to others than to the firm itself. 
Comparisons of postdivestiture and predivestiture market values have shown 
that the breakup value—the sum of the values of a firm’s operating units if each 
were sold separately—of many firms is significantly greater than their com￾bined value. As a result of market valuations, divestiture often creates value in 
excess of the cash or stock received in the transaction. Although these outcomes 
frequently occur, financial theory has been unable to explain them fully and 
satisfactorily.

VALuING ThE TARGET COMPANY
Once the acquiring company isolates a target company that it wishes to acquire, 
it must estimate the target’s value. The value is then used, along with a proposed 
financing scheme, to negotiate the transaction, be it on a friendly basis or a hos￾tile basis. The value of the target is estimated by using the valuation techniques 
presented in Chapter 7 and applied to long-term investment decisions in Chapters 
10, 11, and 12. Similar capital budgeting techniques are applied whether the tar￾get firm is being acquired for its assets or as a going concern.
Acquisitions of Assets
Occasionally, a firm is acquired not for its income-earning potential but as a col￾lection of assets (generally fixed assets) that the acquiring company needs. The 
price paid for this type of acquisition depends largely on which assets are being 
acquired; consideration must also be given to the value of any tax losses. To de￾termine whether the purchase of assets is financially justified, the acquirer must 
estimate both the costs and the benefits of the target assets. This estimation is a 
capital budgeting problem (see Chapters 10, 11, and 12) because an initial cash 
outlay is made to acquire assets, and as a result, future cash inflows are expected.
Clark Company, a major manufacturer of electrical transformers, is interested in 
acquiring certain fixed assets of Noble Company, an industrial electronics com￾pany. Noble, which has tax loss carryforwards from losses over the past 5 years, 
is interested in selling out, but it wishes to sell out entirely, not just to get rid of 
certain fixed assets. A condensed balance sheet for Noble Company follows.
Example 18.3 ▶
Noble Company Balance Sheet
Assets   Liabilities and stockholders’ equity
Cash $ 2,000 Total liabilities $ 80,000
Marketable securities 0 Stockholders’ equity 120,000
Accounts receivable 8,000 Total liabilities and  
Inventories 10,000 stockholders’ equity $200,000
Machine A 10,000  
Machine B 30,000  
Machine C 25,000  
Land and buildings 115,000
Total assets $200,000
Clark Company needs only machines B and C and the land and buildings. 
However, it has made some inquiries and has arranged to sell the accounts receiv￾able, inventories, and machine A for $23,000. Because there is also $2,000 in 
cash, Clark will get $25,000 for the excess assets. Noble wants $100,000 for the 
entire company, which means that Clark will have to pay the firm’s creditors 
$80,000 and its owners $20,000. The actual outlay required of Clark after liqui￾dating the unneeded assets will be $75,000 [($80,000 1 $20,000) 2 $25,000].

In other words, to obtain the use of the desired assets (machines B and C and the 
land and buildings) and the benefits of Noble’s tax losses, Clark must pay 
$75,000. The after-tax cash inflows that are expected to result from the new as￾sets and applicable tax losses are $14,000 per year for the next 5 years and 
$12,000 per year for the following 5 years. The desirability of this asset acquisi￾tion can be determined by calculating the net present value of this outlay using 
Clark Company’s 11% cost of capital, as shown in Table 18.2. Because the net 
present value of $3,063 is greater than zero, Clark’s value should be increased by 
acquiring Noble Company’s assets.
Acquisitions of Going Concerns
Acquisitions of target companies that are going concerns are best analyzed by us￾ing capital budgeting techniques similar to those described for asset acquisitions. 
The methods of estimating expected cash flows from an acquisition are similar to 
those used in estimating capital budgeting cash flows. Typically, pro forma in￾come statements reflecting the postmerger revenues and costs attributable to the 
target company are prepared (see Chapter 4). They are then adjusted to reflect 
the expected cash flows over the relevant time period. Whenever a firm considers 
acquiring a target company that has different risk behaviors, it should risk-adjust 
the cost of capital before applying the appropriate capital budgeting techniques 
(see Chapter 12).
Square Company, a major media company, is contemplating the acquisition of 
Circle Company, a small independent film producer that can be purchased for 
$60,000. Square currently has a high degree of financial leverage, which is re￾flected in its 13% cost of capital. Because of the low financial leverage of Circle 
Company, Square estimates that its overall cost of capital will drop to 10% 
after the acquisition. Because the effect of the less risky capital structure cannot 
be reflected in the expected cash flows, the postmerger cost of capital (10%) 
must be used to evaluate the cash flows that are expected from the acquisition.

The postmerger cash flows attributable to the target company are forecast over 
a 30-year time horizon. These estimated cash flows (all inflows) and the result￾ing net present value of the target company, Circle Company, are shown in 
Table 18.3.
Because the $2,364 net present value of the target company is greater than 
zero, the merger is acceptable. Note that if the effect of the changed capital struc￾ture on the cost of capital had not been considered, the acquisition would have 
been found unacceptable because the net present value at a 13% cost of capital is 
negative $11,868.
STOCK SWAP TRANSACTIONS
Once the value of the target company is determined, the acquirer must develop a 
proposed financing package. The simplest (but probably the least common) case 
is a pure cash purchase. Beyond this extreme case, there are virtually an infinite 
number of financing packages that use various combinations of cash, debt, pre￾ferred stock, and common stock.
Here we look at the other extreme, stock swap transactions, in which the 
acquisition is paid for using an exchange of common stock. The acquiring firm 
exchanges its shares for shares of the target company according to a predeter￾mined ratio. The ratio of exchange of shares is determined in the merger negotia￾tions. This ratio affects the various financial yardsticks that are used by existing 
and prospective shareholders to value the merged firm’s shares. The use of stock 
swaps to finance mergers is a popular approach.
Ratio of Exchange
When one firm swaps its stock for the shares of another firm, the firms must de￾termine the number of shares of the acquiring firm to be exchanged for each 
share of the target firm. The first requirement, of course, is that the acquiring 
company have sufficient shares available to complete the transaction. Often, a 
firm’s repurchase of shares (discussed in Chapter 14) is necessary to obtain suffi￾cient shares for such a transaction. The acquiring firm generally offers enough of 
its own shares that the value of the shares given up exceeds the value of one target 
share. The actual ratio of exchange is merely the ratio of the amount paid per 
stock swap transaction

share of the target company to the market price per share of the acquiring firm. It 
is calculated in this manner because the acquiring firm pays the target firm in 
stock, which has a value equal to its market price.
Grand Company, a leather products concern whose stock is currently selling for 
$80 per share, is interested in acquiring Small Company, a producer of belts. To 
prepare for the acquisition, Grand has been repurchasing its own shares over the 
past 3 years. Small’s stock is currently selling for $75 per share, but in the merger 
negotiations Grand has found it necessary to offer Small $110 per share. Because 
Grand does not have sufficient financial resources to purchase the firm for cash 
and does not wish to raise these funds, Small has agreed to accept Grand’s stock 
in exchange for its shares. As stated, Grand’s stock currently sells for $80 per 
share, and it must pay $110 per share for Small’s stock. Therefore, the ratio of 
exchange is 1.375 ($110 4 $80). So, Grand Company must exchange 1.375 
shares of its stock for each share of Small’s stock.
Effect on Earnings per Share
Although cash flows and value are the primary focus of merger analysis, it is useful 
to consider the effects of a proposed merger on earnings per share: the accounting 
returns that are related to cash flows and value (see Chapter 7). Ordinarily, the re￾sulting earnings per share differ from the premerger earnings per share for both the 
acquiring firm and the target firm. They depend largely on the ratio of exchange 
and the premerger earnings per share of each firm. It is best to view the initial and 
long-run effects of the ratio of exchange on earnings per share separately.
Initial Effect When the ratio of exchange is equal to 1 and both the acquir￾ing firm and the target firm have the same premerger earnings per share, the 
merged firm’s earnings per share will initially remain constant. In this rare in￾stance, both the acquiring firm and the target firm would also have equal price/
earnings (P/E) ratios. In actuality, the earnings per share of the merged firm are 
generally above the premerger earnings per share of one firm and below the pre￾merger earnings per share of the other, after the necessary adjustment has been 
made for the ratio of exchange.
As we saw in the preceding example, Grand Company is contemplating acquiring 
Small Company by swapping 1.375 shares of its stock for each share of Small’s 
stock. The current financial data related to the earnings and market price for each 
of these companies are given in Table 18.4.

Summary of the Effects on Earnings per Share 
of a Merger between Grand Company and 
Small Company at $110 per Share
To complete the merger and retire the 20,000 shares of Small Company stock 
outstanding, Grand will have to issue and (or) use treasury stock totaling 27,500 
shares (1.375 3 20,000 shares). Once the merger is completed, Grand will have 
152,500 shares of common stock (125,000 1 27,500) outstanding. If the earnings 
of each of the firms remain constant, the merged company will be expected to 
have earnings available for the common stockholders of $600,000 ($500,000 1
$100,000). The earnings per share of the merged company therefore should equal 
approximately $3.93 ($600,000 4 152,500 shares).
It would appear at first that Small Company’s shareholders have sustained a 
decrease in per-share earnings from $5 to $3.93, but because each share of Small 
Company’s original stock is equivalent to 1.375 shares of the merged company’s 
stock, the equivalent earnings per share are actually $5.40 ($3.93 3 1.375). In 
other words, as a result of the merger, Grand Company’s original shareholders 
experience a decrease in earnings per share from $4 to $3.93 to the benefit of 
Small Company’s shareholders, whose earnings per share increase from $5 to 
$5.40. These results are summarized in Table 18.5.
The postmerger earnings per share for owners of the acquiring and target 
companies can be explained by comparing the price/earnings ratio paid by the 
acquiring company with its initial P/E ratio. Table 18.6 summarizes this relation￾ship. By paying more than its current value per dollar of earnings to acquire each 
dollar of earnings (P/E paid . P/E of acquiring company), the acquiring firm 
transfers the claim on a portion of its premerger earnings to the owners of the

target firm. Therefore, on a postmerger basis, the target firm’s EPS increases, and 
the acquiring firm’s EPS decreases. Note that this outcome is nearly always the 
case because the acquirer typically pays, on average, a 50 percent premium above 
the target firm’s market price, which results in the P/E paid being much above its 
own P/E. The P/E ratios associated with the Grand–Small merger demonstrate the 
effect of the merger on EPS.
Grand Company’s P/E ratio is 20, and the P/E ratio paid for Small Company’s 
earnings was 22 ($110 4 $5). Because the P/E paid for Small Company was 
greater than the P/E for Grand Company (22 versus 20), the effect of the merger 
was to decrease the EPS for original holders of shares in Grand Company (from 
$4.00 to $3.93) and to increase the effective EPS of original holders of shares in 
Small Company (from $5.00 to $5.40).
Long-Run Effect The long-run effect of a merger on the earnings per share 
of the merged company depends largely on whether the earnings of the merged 
firm grow. Often, although an initial decrease in the per-share earnings of the 
stock held by the original owners of the acquiring firm is expected, the long-run 
effects of the merger on earnings per share are quite favorable. Because firms 
generally expect growth in earnings, the key factor enabling the acquiring com￾pany to experience higher future EPS than it would have without the merger is 
that the earnings attributable to the target company’s assets grow more rapidly 
than those resulting from the acquiring company’s premerger assets. An example 
will clarify this point.
In 2015, Grand Company acquired Small Company by swapping 1.375 shares of 
its common stock for each share of Small Company. Other key financial data and 
the effects of this exchange ratio were discussed in preceding examples. The total 
earnings of Grand Company were expected to grow at an annual rate of 3% 
without the merger; Small Company’s earnings were expected to grow at a 7% 
annual rate without the merger. The same growth rates are expected to apply to 
the component earnings streams with the merger. The table in Figure 18.1 shows 
the future effects on EPS for Grand Company without and with the proposed 
Small Company merger on the basis of these growth rates.
The table indicates that the earnings per share without the merger will be 
greater than the EPS with the merger for the years 2015 through 2017. After 
2017, however, the EPS will be higher than they would have been without the 
merger as a result of the faster earnings growth rate of Small Company (7% ver￾sus 3%). Although a few years are required for this difference in the growth rate 
of earnings to pay off, in the future Grand Company will receive an earnings 
benefit as a result of merging with Small Company at a 1.375 ratio of exchange. 
The long-run earnings advantage of the merger is clearly depicted in Figure 18.1.3
Example 18.7 ▶
Example 18.8 ▶
3. To discover properly whether the merger is beneficial, the earnings estimates under each alternative would have to 
be made over a long period of time—say, 50 years—and then converted to cash flows and discounted at the appro￾priate rate. The alternative with the higher present value would be preferred. For simplicity, only the basic intuitive 
view of the long-run effect is presented here.784 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
Effect on Market Price per Share
The market price per share does not necessarily remain constant after the acquisi￾tion of one firm by another. Adjustments occur in the marketplace in response to 
changes in expected earnings, the dilution of ownership, changes in risk, and 
certain other operating and financial changes. By using the ratio of exchange, we 
can calculate a ratio of exchange in market price that indicates the market price 
per share of the acquiring firm paid for each dollar of market price per share of 
the target firm. This ratio, the MPR, is defined by

The market price of Grand Company’s stock was $80 and that of Small Company’s 
was $75. The ratio of exchange was 1.375. Substituting these values into Equation 
18.1 yields a ratio of exchange in market price of 1.47 [($80 * 1.375) , $75]. 
So, $1.47 of the market price of Grand Company is given in exchange for every 
$1.00 of the market price of Small Company.
The ratio of exchange in market price is normally greater than 1, which indi￾cates that to acquire a firm, the acquirer must pay a premium above the target’s 
market price. Even so, the original owners of the acquiring firm may still gain 
because the merged firm’s stock may sell at a price/earnings ratio above the indi￾vidual premerger ratios as a result of the improved risk and return relationship 
perceived by shareholders and other investors.
The financial data developed earlier for the Grand–Small merger can be used to 
explain the market price effects of a merger. If the earnings of the merged com￾pany remain at the premerger levels and if the stock of the merged company sells 
at an assumed multiple of 21 times earnings, the values in Table 18.7 can be ex￾pected. Although Grand Company’s earnings per share decline from $4.00 to 
$3.93 (see Table 18.5), the market price of its shares will increase from $80.00 to 
$82.53 as a result of the merger.
Although the behavior exhibited in the preceding example is not unusual, the 
financial manager must recognize that only with proper management of the 
merged enterprise can its market value be improved. If the merged firm cannot 
achieve sufficiently high earnings in view of its risk, there is no guarantee that its 
market price will reach the forecast value. Nevertheless, a policy of acquiring 
firms with low P/Es can produce favorable results for the owners of the acquiring 
firm. Acquisitions are especially attractive when the acquiring firm’s stock price 
is high because fewer shares must be exchanged to acquire a given firm.
MERGER NEGOTIATION PROCESS
Mergers are often handled by investment bankers, financial intermediaries who, in 
addition to their role in selling new security issues (described in Chapter 7), can be 
hired by acquirers to find suitable target companies and assist in negotiations. Once 
a target company is selected, the investment banker negotiates with its management 
or investment banker. Likewise, when management wishes to sell the firm or an op￾erating unit of the firm, it will hire an investment banker to seek out potential buyers.

If attempts to negotiate with the management of the target company break 
down, the acquiring firm, often with the aid of its investment banker, can make a 
direct appeal to shareholders by using tender offers (as explained in the following 
discussion). The investment banker is typically compensated with a fixed fee, a 
commission tied to the transaction price, or a combination of fees and commissions.
Management Negotiations
To initiate negotiations, the acquiring firm must make an offer either in cash or 
based on a stock swap with a specified ratio of exchange. The target company 
then reviews the offer and, in light of alternative offers, accepts or rejects the 
terms presented. A desirable merger candidate may receive more than a single 
offer. Usually, it is necessary to resolve certain nonfinancial issues related to the 
existing management, product line policies, financing policies, and the indepen￾dence of the target firm. The key factor, of course, is the per-share price offered 
in cash or reflected in the ratio of exchange. Sometimes negotiations break down.
Tender Offers
When negotiations for an acquisition fail, tender offers may be used to negotiate 
a “hostile merger” directly with the firm’s stockholders. As noted in Chapter 14, 
a tender offer is a formal offer to purchase a given number of shares of a firm’s 
stock at a specified price. The offer is made to all the stockholders at a premium 
above the market price. Occasionally, the acquirer will make a two-tier offer, in 
which the terms offered are more attractive to those who tender shares early. An 
example of a two-tier offer is when the acquirer offers to pay $25 per share for 
the first 60 percent of the outstanding shares tendered and only $23 per share for 
the remaining shares. Stockholders are advised of a tender offer through an￾nouncements in financial newspapers or through direct communications from the 
offering firm. Sometimes a tender offer is made to add pressure to existing merger 
negotiations. In other cases, the tender offer may be made without warning as an 
attempt at an abrupt corporate takeover.
Fighting hostile Takeovers
If the management of a target firm does not favor a merger or considers the price 
offered in a proposed merger too low, it is likely to take defensive actions to ward 
off the hostile takeover. Such actions are generally taken with the assistance of 
investment bankers and lawyers who help the firm develop and employ effective 
takeover defenses. There are obvious strategies, such as informing stockholders 
of the alleged damaging effects of a takeover, acquiring another company (dis￾cussed earlier in the chapter), or attempting to sue the acquiring firm on antitrust 
or other grounds. In addition, many other defenses exist (some with colorful 
names), such as a white knight, poison pills, greenmail, leveraged recapitaliza￾tion, golden parachutes, and shark repellents.
The white knight strategy involves the target firm finding a more suitable 
acquirer (the “white knight”) and prompting it to compete with the initial hostile 
acquirer to take over the firm. If being taken over is nearly certain, the target firm 
attempts to be taken over by a firm deemed most acceptable to its management. 
Poison pills typically involve the creation of securities that give their holders cer￾tain rights that become effective when a takeover is attempted. The “pill” allows 
the shareholders to receive special voting rights or securities that make the firm

firm issues securities that give

less desirable to the hostile acquirer. Greenmail is a strategy by which the firm 
repurchases, through private negotiation, a large block of stock at a premium 
from one or more shareholders to end a hostile takeover attempt by those share￾holders. Clearly, greenmail is a form of corporate blackmail by the holders of a 
large block of shares.
Another defense against hostile takeover involves the use of a leveraged re￾capitalization, which is a strategy involving the payment of a large debt-financed 
cash dividend. This strategy significantly increases the firm’s financial leverage, 
thereby deterring the takeover attempt. In addition, as a further deterrent, the 
recapitalization is often structured to increase the equity and control of the exist￾ing management. Golden parachutes are provisions in the employment contracts 
of key executives that provide them with sizable compensation if the firm is taken 
over. Golden parachutes deter hostile takeovers to the extent that the cash 
outflows required by these contracts are large enough to make the takeover unat￾tractive to the acquirer. Another defense is use of shark repellents, which are 
antitakeover amendments to the corporate charter that constrain the firm’s abil￾ity to transfer managerial control of the firm as a result of a merger. Although 
this defense could entrench existing management, many firms have had these 
amendments ratified by shareholders.
Because takeover defenses tend to insulate management from shareholders, 
the potential for litigation is great when these strategies are employed. Lawsuits 
are sometimes filed against management by dissident shareholders. In addition, 
federal and state governments frequently intervene when a proposed takeover is 
deemed to be in violation of federal or state law. A number of states have legisla￾tion on their books limiting or restricting hostile takeovers of companies domi￾ciled within their boundaries.
hOLdING COMPANIES
A holding company is a corporation that has voting control of one or more other 
corporations. The holding company may need to own only a small percentage of 
the outstanding shares to have this voting control. In the case of companies with 
a relatively small number of shareholders, as much as 30 to 40 percent of the 
stock may be required. In the case of firms with a widely dispersed ownership, 10 
to 20 percent of the shares may be sufficient to gain voting control. A holding 
company that wants to obtain voting control of a firm may use direct market 
purchases or tender offers to acquire needed shares. Although there are relatively 
few holding companies and they are far less important than mergers, it is helpful 
to understand their key advantages and disadvantages.
Advantages of holding Companies
The primary advantage of holding companies is the leverage effect that permits 
the firm to control a large amount of assets with a relatively small dollar invest￾ment. In other words, the owners of a holding company can control significantly 
larger amounts of assets than they could acquire through mergers.
Carr Company, a holding company, currently holds voting control of two subsid￾iaries, company X and company Y. Table 18.8 presents the balance sheets for 
Carr and its two subsidiaries. Carr owns approximately 17% ($10 , $60) of

company X and 20% ($14 , $70) of company Y. These holdings are sufficient 
for voting control.
The owners of Carr Company’s $12 worth of equity have control over $260 
worth of assets (company X’s $100 worth and company Y’s $160 worth). Thus, 
the owners’ equity represents only about 4.6% ($12 , $260) of the total assets 
controlled. From the discussions of ratio analysis, leverage, and capital structure 
in Chapters 3 and 13, you should recognize that this is quite a high degree of le￾verage. If an individual stockholder or even another holding company owns $3 of 
Carr Company’s stock, which is assumed to be sufficient for its control, it will in 
actuality control the whole $260 of assets. The investment itself in this case 
would represent only 1.15% ($3 , $260) of the assets controlled.
The high leverage obtained through a holding company arrangement greatly 
magnifies earnings and losses for the holding company. Quite often, a pyramiding
of holding companies occurs when one holding company controls other holding 
companies, thereby causing an even greater magnification of earnings and losses. 
The greater the leverage, the greater the risk involved. The risk–return trade-off is 
a key consideration in the holding company decision.
Another commonly cited advantage of holding companies is that the risk 
protection that results from the failure of one of the companies (such as Y in the 
preceding example) does not result in the failure of the entire holding company. 
Because each subsidiary is a separate corporation, the failure of one company 
should cost the holding company, at maximum, no more than its investment in 
that subsidiary. Other advantages include the following: (1) Certain state tax 
benefits may be realized by each subsidiary in its state of incorporation,

(2) lawsuits or legal actions against a subsidiary do not threaten the remaining 
companies, and (3) it is generally easy to gain control of a firm because stock￾holder or management approval is not generally necessary.
disadvantages of holding Companies
A major disadvantage of holding companies is the increased risk resulting from 
the leverage effect. When general economic conditions are unfavorable, a loss by 
one subsidiary may be magnified. For example, if subsidiary company X in Table 
18.8 experiences a loss, its inability to pay dividends to Carr Company could re￾sult in Carr Company’s inability to meet its scheduled payments.
Another disadvantage is double taxation. Before paying dividends, a subsid￾iary must pay federal and state taxes on its earnings. Although a 70 percent tax 
exclusion is allowed on dividends received by one corporation from another, the 
remaining 30 percent received is taxable. (In the event that the holding company 
owns between 20 and 80 percent of the stock in a subsidiary, the exclusion is 
80 percent; if it owns more than 80 percent of the stock in the subsidiary, 100 
percent of the dividends are excluded.) If a subsidiary were part of a merged com￾pany, double taxation would not exist.
Another disadvantage is that holding companies are difficult to analyze. Se￾curity analysts and investors typically have difficulty understanding holding com￾panies because of the complexity of such firms. As a result, these firms tend to sell 
at low multiples of earnings (P/Es), and the shareholder value of holding compa￾nies may suffer.
A final disadvantage of holding companies is the generally high cost of ad￾ministration that results from maintaining each subsidiary company as a separate 
entity. A merger, on the other hand, is likely to result in certain administrative 
economies of scale. The need for coordination and communication between the 
holding company and its subsidiaries may further elevate these costs.
INTERNATIONAL MERGERS
Perhaps in no other area does U.S. financial practice differ more fundamentally 
from practices in other countries than in the field of mergers. Outside of the 
United States (and, to a lesser degree, Great Britain), hostile takeovers are virtu￾ally nonexistent, and in some countries (such as Japan), takeovers of any kind are 
uncommon. The emphasis in the United States and Great Britain on shareholder 
value and reliance on public capital markets for financing is generally not shared 
by companies in continental Europe. In general, companies there are generally 
smaller, and other stakeholders, such as employees, bankers, and governments, 
are accorded greater consideration. The U.S. approach is also not the norm in 
Japan and other Asian nations.
Changes in Western Europe
Today, there are signs that Western Europe is moving toward a U.S.-style ap￾proach to shareholder value and public capital market financing. Since the Euro￾pean Union’s (EU’s) economic and monetary union (EMU) integration involving 
the introduction of a single European currency, the euro, on January 1, 2002, the 
number, size, and importance of cross-border European mergers has continued to 
grow rapidly. Nationally focused companies want to achieve economies of scale 790 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
in manufacturing, encourage international product development strategies, and 
develop distribution networks across the continent. They are also driven by the 
need to compete with U.S. companies, which have been operating on a continent￾wide basis in Europe for decades.
These larger Europe-based companies are expected to become even more for￾midable competitors as more national barriers are removed. Although the vast 
majority of these cross-border mergers are friendly in nature, a few have been 
actively resisted by target firm managements. It seems clear that as European 
companies come to rely more on public capital markets for financing and as the 
market for common stock becomes more truly European in character, rather than 
French or British or German, active markets for European corporate equity will 
continue to evolve.
Foreign Takeovers of u.S. Companies
Both European and Japanese companies have been active as acquirers of U.S. 
companies in recent years. Foreign companies purchased U.S. firms for two 
major reasons: to gain access to the world’s single largest, richest, and least 
regulated market and to acquire world-class technology. British companies 
have been historically the most active acquirers of U.S. firms. In the late 1980s, 
Japanese corporations surged to prominence with a series of very large acquisi￾tions, including two in the entertainment industry: Sony’s purchase of Colum￾bia Pictures and Matsushita’s acquisition of MCA. More recently, German 
firms have become especially active acquirers of U.S. companies as producing 
export goods in Germany has become prohibitively expensive. (German work￾ers have some of the world’s highest wages and one of the shortest work￾weeks.) The Global Focus box describes recent mergers by Australian media 
giant News Corp. It seems inevitable that foreign companies will continue to 
acquire U.S. firms even as U.S. companies continue to seek attractive acquisi￾tions abroad.

 18.4 Business Failure Fundamentals
A business failure is an unfortunate circumstance. Although the majority of firms 
that fail do so within the first year or two of life, other firms grow, mature, and 
fail much later. The failure of a business can be viewed in a number of ways and 
can result from one or more causes.
 In July 2005, Australian￾based media giant 
News Corp launched a series of acquisi￾tions involving U.S. assets. The first was a 
$580 million buyout of Intermix Media, 
owner of Myspace.com, the fifth most 
viewed Internet domain in the United 
States at the time. Rupert Murdoch, the 
media mogul running News Corp, calcu￾lated that the Myspace networking site 
would drive traffic to his Fox TV sites.
Murdoch’s next purchase came in 
September 2006, when News Corp 
acquired, from Verisign, a majority 
stake in Jamba, which runs Jamster, a 
download service for such commodities 
as ring tones and screen “wallpapers.” 
News Corp’s intent was to hardwire 
Fox’s presence in the entire content life 
cycle, from creation, through produc￾tion, to delivery on your screen. It 
already had a mobile content provider, 
Mobizzo, launched in June 2005 under 
the Fox Mobile Entertainment division. 
Among the things Mobizzo was 
designed to offer were 1-minute epi￾sodes derived from Fox properties such 
as its American Idol franchise.
In May 2007, News Corp set its 
sight on a new target, Dow Jones, pub￾lisher of The Wall Street Journal and Bar￾ron’s and the owner of other financial 
news and content assets, including the 
Dow Jones Newswires, the financial 
website MarketWatch, and several stock 
market indicators (for example, the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average). Murdoch’s 
News Corp bid $5 billion for Dow Jones 
but faced resistance from members of the 
Bancroft family—descendents of 
Clarence Barron, the “father of financial 
journalism”—which controls more than 
50 percent of the voting power in the 
company. The News Corp bid was 
remarkable for its premium, which would 
value Dow Jones at more than double its 
trading value prior to the bid.
International mergers such as the 
ones pursued by News Corp are not as 
easy to execute as domestic mergers. 
Complicating matters are multiple legal 
and regulatory regimes, cultural differ￾ences, and complex timing requirements 
involving simultaneously closing the deal 
in multiple jurisdictions. Further complica￾tions may arise from a potential distrust 
of employees or owners from another 
country. In the Dow Jones case, the Dow 
Jones board and the Bancroft family 
sought to negotiate some level of inde￾pendence for the Journal so that it might 
remain free of corporate interference.
Ultimately, Rupert Murdoch would 
have his way. On December 13, 2007, 
News Corp announced the completion of 
its acquisition of Dow Jones. The terms of 
the merger agreement provided that each 
share of Dow Jones common stock was 
entitled to receive, at the election of the 
holder, either $60.00 in cash or 2.8681 
shares of Class B common units of Ruby 
Newco LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary 
of News Corp. Ruby Newco Class B 
common units are convertible after a 
period of time into a share of News Corp 
Class A common stock. On completion of 
the merger, Dow Jones became a wholly 
owned subsidiary of Ruby Newco, and 
Natalie Bancroft was appointed to the 
company’s board of directors.
In 2010, the international tide 
changed for News Corp, and selling 
rather than buying became the norm. In 
2010, Fiji’s government began to 
require that the country’s media outlets 
be 90 percent owned by Fiji nationals, 
resulting in the sale of Fijian newspa￾pers (Fiji Times, Nai Lalakai, and Shanti 
Dut ) to Motibhai Group of Companies. 
Then, in 2011, the struggling Myspace, 
which after much effort to find a buyer, 
was sold to buyers Justin Timberlake 
and Specific Media. In July 2011, 
News Corp closed its United Kindom 
News of the World newspaper, which 
was in the midst of a scandal, and with￾drew its takeover bid for BSkyB.
Citing growing concerns about the 
recent scandals and a desire to “unlock 
even greater long-term shareholder 
value,” Murdoch announced on June 
28, 2012, that News Corp would be 
split into two new publicly traded com￾panies. Publishing operations became 
the “new” News Corporation, with 
Robert James Thomson, editor of The 
Wall Street Journal, as CEO. Murdoch 
remained CEO of the media opera￾tions and properties (such as the Fox 
Entertainment Group and 20th Century 
Fox) that became 21st Century Fox. 
Murdoch remains chairman for both 
companies.

TYPES OF BuSINESS FAILuRE
A firm may fail because its returns are negative or low. A firm that consistently 
reports operating losses will probably experience a decline in market value. If the 
firm fails to earn a return that is greater than its cost of capital, it can be viewed 
as having failed. Negative or low returns, unless remedied, are likely to result 
eventually in one of the following more serious types of failure.
A second type of failure, insolvency, occurs when a firm is unable to pay its lia￾bilities as they come due. When a firm is insolvent, its assets are still greater than its 
liabilities, but it is confronted with a liquidity crisis. If some of its assets can be con￾verted into cash within a reasonable period, the company may be able to escape com￾plete failure. If not, the result is the third and most serious type of failure, bankruptcy.
Bankruptcy occurs when the stated value of a firm’s liabilities exceeds the fair 
market value of its assets. A bankrupt firm has a negative stockholders’ equity,4
which means that the claims of creditors cannot be satisfied unless the firm’s as￾sets can be liquidated for more than their book value. Although bankruptcy is an 
obvious form of failure, the courts treat insolvency and bankruptcy in the same 
way. They are both considered to indicate the financial failure of the firm.
MAJOR CAuSES OF BuSINESS FAILuRE
The primary cause of business failure is mismanagement, which accounts for 
more than 50 percent of all cases. Numerous specific managerial faults can cause 
the firm to fail. Overexpansion, poor financial actions, an ineffective sales force, 
and high production costs can all singly or in combination cause failure. For ex￾ample, poor financial actions include bad capital budgeting decisions (based on 
unrealistic sales and cost forecasts, failure to identify all relevant cash flows, or 
failure to assess risk properly), poor financial evaluation of the firm’s strategic 
plans prior to making financial commitments, inadequate or nonexistent cash 
flow planning, and failure to control receivables and inventories. Because all ma￾jor corporate decisions are eventually measured in terms of dollars, the financial 
manager may play a key role in avoiding or causing a business failure. It is the 
duty of the financial manager to monitor the firm’s financial pulse. For example, 
Enron Corporation’s early 2002 bankruptcy (then the largest ever) was attrib￾uted mainly to questionable partnerships set up by Enron’s CFO, Andrew Fas￾tow. Those partnerships were intended to hide Enron’s debt, inflate its profits, 
and enrich its top management. In late 2001, these transactions lost large amounts 
of money, causing the corporation to file bankruptcy and resulting in criminal 
charges against Enron’s key executives as well as its auditor, Arthur Andersen, 
which failed to accurately disclose Enron’s financial condition.
Economic activity—especially economic downturns—can contribute to the 
failure of a firm.5

when the stated value of a

4. Because on a balance sheet the firm’s assets equal the sum of its liabilities and stockholders’ equity, the only way 
a firm that has more liabilities than assets can balance its balance sheet is to have a negative stockholders’ equity.
5. The success of some firms runs countercyclical to economic activity, and other firms are unaffected by economic 
activity. For example, the auto repair business is likely to grow during a recession because people are less likely to 
buy new cars and therefore need more repairs on their unwarrantied older cars. The sales of boats and other luxury 
items may decline during a recession, whereas sales of staple items such as electricity are likely to be unaffected. In 
terms of beta—the measure of nondiversifiable risk developed in Chapter 8—a negative-beta stock would be associ￾ated with a firm whose behavior is generally countercyclical to economic activity.ChAPTER 18   Mergers, LBOs, Divestitures, and Business Failure 793
abruptly, leaving the firm with high fixed costs and insufficient revenues to cover 
them. Rapid rises in interest rates just prior to a recession can further contribute 
to cash flow problems and make it more difficult for the firm to obtain and main￾tain needed financing.
A final cause of business failure is corporate maturity. Firms, like individuals, 
do not have infinite lives. Like a product, a firm goes through the stages of birth, 
growth, maturity, and eventual decline. The firm’s management should attempt 
to prolong the growth stage through research, new products, and mergers. Once 
the firm has matured and has begun to decline, it should seek to be acquired by 
another firm or liquidate before it fails. Effective management planning should 
help the firm to postpone decline and ultimate failure.
VOLuNTARY SETTLEMENTS
When a firm becomes insolvent or bankrupt, it may arrange with its creditors a 
voluntary settlement, which enables it to bypass many of the costs involved in 
legal bankruptcy proceedings. The settlement is normally initiated by the debtor 
firm because such an arrangement may enable it to continue to exist or to be liq￾uidated in a manner that gives the owners the greatest chance of recovering part 
of their investment. The debtor arranges a meeting between itself and all its cred￾itors. At the meeting, a committee of creditors is selected to analyze the debtor’s 
situation and recommend a plan of action. The recommendations of the commit￾tee are discussed with both the debtor and the creditors, and a plan for sustaining 
or liquidating the firm is drawn up.
“What’s good for Gen￾eral Motors is good for 
America.” That quote, often attributed to 
Charlie Wilson, chairman and CEO of 
General Motors (GM) from 1941 to 
1953, is meant to convey the impor￾tance of GM to the U.S. economy. For 
most of the second half of the twentieth 
century, GM ranked as the largest cor￾poration by market capitalization in the 
United States. At the company’s peak in 
the 1970s, it employed nearly 400,000 
factory workers. Many more were em￾ployed by the company’s financing sub￾sidiaries, suppliers, retailers, and other 
ancillary businesses.
However, by the end of the first 
decade of the new millennium, GM’s 
fortunes had changed. The company, 
which at one time manufactured one of 
every two cars sold in the United States, 
was being challenged for the top spot 
by Toyota. GM was slow to adjust to 
shifting consumer demands and found 
itself bloated and saddled with pension 
and health care commitments to retirees 
estimated at $2,000 per car sold. In 
2008, recession struck, and total U.S. 
vehicle sales dropped by almost 20 
percent. GM fell into a tailspin and, on 
June 1, 2009, filed for bankruptcy pro￾tection. Aware of the company’s impor￾tance to their economies, the U.S. and 
Canadian governments provided finan￾cial support and received ownership 
stakes of 60 percent and 12.5 percent, 
respectively.
The government bailout raises an 
interesting ethical dilemma. When a 
company becomes too big to fail, how 
might its financial managers’ decisions 
change when they can count on govern￾ment support if a crisis arises? Some sug￾gest that an implicit government back￾stop encourages firms to take outsized 
risks. Essentially, because the govern￾ment guarantee protects a firm on the 
downside, it tempts the firm to take 
greater risks with the potential for greater 
rewards. Unfortunately, guarantees are 
not free, as taxpayers may soon find out.

Voluntary Settlement to Sustain the Firm
Normally, the rationale for sustaining a firm depends on whether the firm’s re￾covery is feasible. By sustaining the firm, the creditor can continue to receive 
business from it. A number of strategies are commonly used. An extension is an 
arrangement whereby the firm’s creditors receive payment in full, although not 
immediately. Normally, when creditors grant an extension, they require the firm 
to make cash payments for purchases until all past debts have been paid. A sec￾ond arrangement, called composition, is a pro rata cash settlement of creditor 
claims. Instead of receiving full payment of their claims, creditors receive only a 
partial payment. A uniform percentage of each dollar owed is paid in satisfaction 
of each creditor’s claim.
A third arrangement is creditor control. In this case, the creditor committee 
may decide that maintaining the firm is feasible only if the operating management 
is replaced. The committee may then take control of the firm and operate it until 
all claims have been settled. Sometimes, a plan involving some combination of 
extension, composition, and creditor control will result. An example of this ar￾rangement is a settlement whereby the debtor agrees to pay a total of 75 cents on 
the dollar in three annual installments of 25 cents on the dollar, and the creditors 
agree to sell additional merchandise to the firm on 30-day terms if the existing 
management is replaced by new management that is acceptable to them.
Voluntary Settlement Resulting in Liquidation
After the situation of the firm has been investigated by the creditor committee, 
the only acceptable course of action may be liquidation of the firm. Liquidation 
can be carried out either privately or through the legal procedures provided by 
bankruptcy law. If the debtor firm is willing to accept liquidation, legal proce￾dures may not be required. Generally, the avoidance of litigation enables the 
creditors to obtain quicker and higher settlements. However, all the creditors 
must agree to a private liquidation for it to be feasible.
The objective of the voluntary liquidation process is to recover as much per 
dollar owed as possible. Under voluntary liquidation, common stockholders (the 
firm’s true owners) cannot receive any funds until the claims of all other parties 
have been satisfied. A common procedure is to have a meeting of the creditors at 
which they make an assignment by passing the power to liquidate the firm’s as￾sets to an adjustment bureau, a trade association, or a third party, which is desig￾nated the assignee. The assignee’s job is to liquidate the assets, obtaining the best 
price possible. The assignee is sometimes referred to as the trustee because it is 
entrusted with the title to the company’s assets and the responsibility to liquidate 
them efficiently. Once the trustee has liquidated the assets, it distributes the re￾covered funds to the creditors and owners (if any funds remain for the owners). 
The final action in a private liquidation is for the creditors to sign a release attest￾ing to the satisfactory settlement of their claims.

BANKRuPTCY LEGISLATION
Bankruptcy in the legal sense occurs when the firm cannot pay its bills or when 
its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets. In either case, a firm may 
be declared legally bankrupt. However, creditors generally attempt to avoid forc￾ing a firm into bankruptcy if it appears to have opportunities for future success.
The U.S. Constitution (Article 1, Section 8, Clause 4) governs bankruptcy in 
the United States and authorizes Congress to enact “uniform Laws on the subject 
of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.” Since 1801, Congress has exer￾cised its authority several times and in 1978 significantly modified earlier bank￾ruptcy legislation by enacting the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, which is com￾monly referred to as the “Bankruptcy Code” (“Code”). The code contains eight 
odd-numbered chapters (1 through 15) and one even-numbered chapter (12). A 
number of these chapters would apply in the instance of failure; the two key ones 
are Chapters 7 and 11. Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 details 
the procedures to be followed when liquidating a failed firm. Chapter 7 typically 
comes into play once it has been determined that a fair, equitable, and feasible 
basis for the reorganization of a failed firm does not exist (although a firm may of 
its own accord choose not to reorganize and may instead go directly into liquida￾tion). Chapter 11 outlines the procedures for reorganizing a failed (or failing) firm, 
whether its petition is filed voluntarily or involuntarily. If a workable plan for re￾organization cannot be developed, the firm will be liquidated under Chapter 7.

REORGANIZATION IN BANKRuPTCY (ChAPTER 11)
There are two basic types of reorganization petitions: voluntary and involuntary. 
Any firm that is not a municipal or financial institution can file a petition for 
voluntary reorganization on its own behalf.6
Involuntary reorganization is initi￾ated by an outside party, usually a creditor. An involuntary petition against a 
firm can be filed if one of three conditions is met:
 1. The firm has past-due debts of $5,000 or more.
 2. Three or more creditors can prove that they have aggregate unpaid claims of 
$5,000 against the firm. If the firm has fewer than 12 creditors, any creditor 
that is owed more than $5,000 can file the petition.
 3. The firm is insolvent, which means that (a) it is not paying its debts as they 
come due, (b) within the preceding 120 days a custodian (a third party) was 
appointed or took possession of the debtor’s property, or (c) the fair market 
value of the firm’s assets is less than the stated value of its liabilities.
Procedures
A reorganization petition under Chapter 11 must be filed in a federal bankruptcy 
court. On the filing of this petition, the filing firm becomes the debtor in 
possession (DIP) of the assets. If creditors object to the filing firm being the debtor 
in possession, they can ask the judge to appoint a trustee. After reviewing the 
firm’s situation, the debtor in possession submits a plan of reorganization and a 
disclosure statement summarizing the plan to the court. A hearing is held to de￾termine whether the plan is fair, equitable, and feasible and whether the disclosure 
statement contains adequate information. The court’s approval or disapproval is 
based on its evaluation of the plan in light of these standards. A plan is consid￾ered fair and equitable if it maintains the priorities of the contractual claims of 
the creditors, preferred stockholders, and common stockholders. The court must 
also find the reorganization plan feasible, which means that it must be workable.
The reorganized corporation must have sufficient working capital, enough funds 
to cover fixed charges, adequate credit prospects, and the ability to retire or 
refund debts as proposed by the plan.
Once approved, the plan and the disclosure statement are given to the firm’s 
creditors and shareholders for their acceptance. Under the Bankruptcy Reform 
Act, creditors and owners are separated into groups with similar types of claims. 
In the case of creditor groups, approval of the plan is required by holders of at 
least two-thirds of the dollar amount of claims as well as by a numerical majority 
of creditors. In the case of ownership groups (preferred and common stockhold￾ers), two-thirds of the shares in each group must approve the reorganization plan 
for it to be accepted. Once accepted and confirmed by the court, the plan is put 
into effect as soon as possible.
Individuals, like corporations, sometimes fail financially. Typ￾ically, a lack of financial planning, a heavy debt load, or an 
economic recession are factors that cause debtors to start missing payments and 
Personal Finance Example 18.12 ▶
6. Firms sometimes file a voluntary petition to obtain temporary legal protection from creditors or from prolonged 
litigation. Once they have straightened out their financial or legal affairs—prior to further reorganization or liquida￾tion actions—they will have the petition dismissed. Although such actions are not the intent of the bankruptcy law, 
difficulty in enforcing the law has allowed this abuse to occur.

experiencing deterioration in their credit ratings. Unless they take corrective ac￾tion, repossession of debt-financed property and eventually personal bankruptcy 
will follow. Individuals in dire financial straits have two legal options: a wage 
earner plan or straight bankruptcy.
A wage earner plan, defined under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 
is a “work-out” procedure that involves some type of debt restructuring, typi￾cally establishing a debt-repayment schedule that is workable in light of the 
individual’s personal income. It is similar to reorganization in a corporate bank￾ruptcy. A majority of creditors must agree to this plan, under which interest 
payments and late fees are waived during the repayment period. If approved, the 
individual, who retains the use of and title to all assets, makes payments to the 
court, which then pays off all creditors.
Straight bankruptcy is allowed under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code. It is 
a legal procedure, similar to liquidation in corporate bankruptcy, that effectively 
allows the debtor to “wipe the slate clean and start anew.” However, straight 
bankruptcy does not eliminate all a debtor’s obligations, nor does the debtor lose 
all his or her assets. For example, the debtor must make certain tax payments and 
keep up alimony and child-support payments but can retain certain payments 
from Social Security, retirement, and disability benefits. Depending on state law, 
the debtor can retain a certain amount of equity in a home, a car, and other assets.
The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 
(BAPCPA) made several significant changes to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Many 
of the provisions are intended to make it more difficult for individuals to file for 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy, under which most debts are discharged. Instead, BAPCPA 
requires them to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, under which only a portion of 
their debts are discharged.
Role of the debtor in Possession (dIP)
Because reorganization activities are largely in the hands of the debtor in posses￾sion (DIP), it is useful to understand the DIP’s responsibilities. The DIP’s first re￾sponsibility is the valuation of the firm to determine whether reorganization is 
appropriate. To do so, the DIP must estimate both the liquidation value of the 
business and its value as a going concern. If the firm’s value as a going concern is 
less than its liquidation value, the DIP will recommend liquidation. If the oppo￾site is found to be true, the DIP will recommend reorganization, and a plan of 
reorganization must be drawn up.
The key portion of the reorganization plan generally concerns the firm’s cap￾ital structure. Because most firms’ financial difficulties result from high fixed 
charges, the company’s capital structure is generally recapitalized to reduce these 
charges. Under recapitalization, debts are generally exchanged for equity or the 
maturities of existing debts are extended. When recapitalizing the firm, the DIP 
seeks to build a mix of debt and equity that will allow the firm to meet its debts 
and provide a reasonable level of earnings for its owners.
Once the revised capital structure has been determined, the DIP must estab￾lish a plan for exchanging outstanding obligations for new securities. The guiding 
principle is to observe priorities. Senior claims (those with higher legal priority) 
must be satisfied before junior claims (those with lower legal priority). To comply 
with this principle, senior suppliers of capital must receive a claim on new capital 
equal to their previous claim. The common stockholders are the last to receive 
recapitalization

under which a failed firm’s 
debts are generally exchanged 
for equity or the maturities of 
existing debts are extended.798 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
any new securities. (It is not unusual for them to receive nothing.) Security hold￾ers do not necessarily have to receive the same type of security they held before; 
often they receive a combination of securities. Once the debtor in possession has 
determined the new capital structure and distribution of capital, it will submit the 
reorganization plan and disclosure statement to the court as described.
LIQuIdATION IN BANKRuPTCY (ChAPTER 7)
The liquidation of a bankrupt firm usually occurs once the bankruptcy court has 
determined that reorganization is not feasible. A petition for reorganization must 
normally be filed by the managers or creditors of the bankrupt firm. If no petition 
is filed, if a petition is filed and denied, or if the reorganization plan is denied, the 
firm must be liquidated.
Procedures
When a firm is adjudged bankrupt, the judge may appoint a trustee to perform the 
many routine duties required in administering the bankruptcy. The trustee takes 
charge of the property of the bankrupt firm and protects the interest of its credi￾tors. A meeting of creditors must be held between 20 and 40 days after the bank￾ruptcy judgment. At this meeting, the creditors are made aware of the prospects for 
the liquidation. The trustee is given the responsibility to liquidate the firm, keep 
records, examine creditors’ claims, disburse money, furnish information as re￾quired, and make final reports on the liquidation. In essence, the trustee is respon￾sible for the liquidation of the firm. Occasionally, the court will call subsequent 
creditor meetings, but only a final meeting for closing the bankruptcy is required.
Priority of Claims
It is the trustee’s responsibility to liquidate all the firm’s assets and to distribute 
the proceeds to the holders of provable claims. The courts have established cer￾tain procedures for determining the provability of claims. The priority of claims, 
which is specified in Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act, must be main￾tained by the trustee when distributing the funds from liquidation. Any secured 
creditors have specific assets pledged as collateral and, in liquidation, receive pro￾ceeds from the sale of those assets. If these proceeds are inadequate to fully satisfy 
their claims, the secured creditors become unsecured, or general, creditors for the 
unrecovered amount because specific collateral no longer exists. These and all 
other unsecured creditors will divide up, on a pro rata basis, any funds remaining 
after all prior claims have been satisfied. If the proceeds from the sale of secured 
assets are in excess of the claims against them, the excess funds become available 
to meet claims of unsecured creditors.
The complete order of priority of claims is given in Table 18.9. Despite the 
priorities listed in items 1 through 7, secured creditors have first claim on pro￾ceeds from the sale of their collateral. The claims of unsecured creditors, includ￾ing the unpaid claims of secured creditors, are satisfied next, and then, finally, 
come the claims of preferred and common stockholders.

Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
The financial manager is sometimes involved in corporate restructuring activities, 
which involve the expansion and contraction of the firm’s operations or changes 
in its asset or ownership structure. A variety of motives could drive a firm toward 
a merger, but the overriding goal should be maximization of the owners’ wealth. 
Occasionally, merger transactions are heavily debt-financed leveraged buyouts 
(LBOs). In other cases, firms attempt to improve value by divesting themselves of 
certain operating units that they believe constrain the firm’s value, particularly 
when the breakup value is believed to be greater than the firm’s current value.
Whether the firm makes a cash purchase or uses a stock swap to acquire an￾other firm, the risk-adjusted net present value of the transaction should be posi￾tive. In stock swap transactions, the long-run impact on the firm’s earnings and 
risk can be evaluated to estimate the acquiring firm’s postacquisition value. Only 
in cases where additional value is created should the transaction be undertaken.
Business failure, although unpleasant, must be treated similarly; a failing 
firm should be reorganized only when such an act will maximize the owners’ 
wealth. Otherwise, liquidation should be pursued in a fashion that allows the 
owners the greatest amount of recovery. Regardless of whether the firm is grow￾ing, contracting, or being reorganized or liquidated in bankruptcy, the firm 
should take action only when that action is believed to result in a positive con￾tribution to the maximization of the owners’ wealth.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Understand merger fundamentals, including terminology, motives for 
merging, and types of mergers. Mergers result from the combining of firms. Typi￾cally, the acquiring company pursues and attempts to merge with the target com￾pany, on either a friendly or a hostile basis. Mergers are undertaken either for 
strategic reasons to achieve economies of scale or for financial reasons to restruc￾ture the firm to improve its cash flow. The overriding goal of merging is maximi￾zation of share price. Other specific merger motives include growth or diversifica￾tion, synergy, fund raising, increased managerial skill or technology, tax 
considerations, increased ownership liquidity, and defense against takeover. The 
four basic types of mergers are horizontal, vertical, congeneric, and conglomerate.
Describe the objectives and procedures used in leveraged buyouts (LBOs) 
and divestitures. LBOs involve use of a large amount of debt to purchase a firm. 
Divestiture involves the sale of a firm’s assets, typically an operating unit; the 
spin-off of assets into an independent company; or the liquidation of assets. Mo￾tives for divestiture include cash generation and corporate restructuring.
Demonstrate the procedures used to value the target company and discuss 
the effect of stock swap transactions on earnings per share. The value of a target 
company can be estimated by applying capital budgeting techniques to the rele￾vant cash flows. All proposed mergers with positive net present values are con￾sidered acceptable. In a stock swap transaction, a ratio of exchange must be es￾tablished to measure the amount paid per share of the target company relative 
LG 1
LG 2
LG 3ChAPTER 18   Mergers, LBOs, Divestitures, and Business Failure 801
to the per-share market price of the acquiring firm. The resulting relationship 
between the price/earnings (P/E) ratio paid by the acquiring firm and its initial 
P/E affects the merged firm’s earnings per share (EPS) and market price. If the 
P/E paid is greater than the P/E of the acquiring company, the EPS of the acquir￾ing company decrease and the EPS of the target company increase.
Discuss the merger negotiation process, holding companies, and international 
mergers. Acquirers commonly hire investment bankers to find a suitable target 
company and assist in negotiations. A merger can be negotiated with the target 
firm’s management or, in the case of a hostile merger, directly with the firm’s share￾holders by using tender offers. Management of the target firm can employ various 
takeover defenses, such as a white knight, poison pills, greenmail, leveraged recapi￾talization, golden parachutes, and shark repellents. A holding company can be cre￾ated by one firm gaining control of other companies, often by owning as little as 10 
to 20 percent of their stock. The chief advantages of holding companies are the le￾verage effect, risk protection, tax benefits, protection against lawsuits, and the ease 
of gaining control of a subsidiary. Disadvantages include increased risk due to the 
magnification of losses, double taxation, difficulty of analysis, and the high cost of 
administration. Today, mergers of companies in Western Europe have moved toward 
the U.S.-style approach to shareholder value and public capital market financing. 
Both European and Japanese companies have become active acquirers of U.S. firms.
Understand the types and major causes of business failure and the use of 
voluntary settlements to sustain or liquidate the failed firm. A firm may fail be￾cause it has negative or low returns, is insolvent, or is bankrupt. The major 
causes of business failure are mismanagement, downturns in economic activity, 
and corporate maturity. Voluntary settlements are initiated by the debtor and 
can result in sustaining the firm via an extension, a composition, creditor con￾trol of the firm, or a combination of these strategies. If creditors do not agree to 
a plan to sustain a firm, they may recommend voluntary liquidation, which by￾passes many of the legal requirements and costs of bankruptcy proceedings.
Explain bankruptcy legislation and the procedures involved in reorganizing 
or liquidating a bankrupt firm. A failed firm can voluntarily or involuntarily file in 
federal bankruptcy court for reorganization under Chapter 11 or for liquidation 
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. Under Chapter 11, the 
judge will appoint the debtor in possession, which develops a reorganization plan. 
A firm that cannot be reorganized under Chapter 11 or does not petition for reor￾ganization is liquidated under Chapter 7. The responsibility for liquidation is placed 
in the hands of a court-appointed trustee, whose duties include liquidating assets, 
distributing the proceeds, and making a final accounting. Liquidation procedures 
follow a priority of claims for distribution of the proceeds from the sale of assets.

 ST18–1 Cash acquisition decision Luxe Foods is contemplating acquisition of Valley Can￾ning Company for a cash price of $180,000. Luxe currently has high financial lever￾age and therefore has a cost of capital of 14%. As a result of acquiring Valley Can￾ning, which is financed entirely with equity, the firm expects its financial leverage to 
be reduced and its cost of capital to drop to 11%. The acquisition of Valley Canning 
is expected to increase Luxe’s cash inflows by $20,000 per year for the first 3 years 
and by $30,000 per year for the following 12 years.

 Personal Finance Problem
 P18–6 Divestitures In corporate settings, it is not unusual for firms to assess the financial 
viability of a business unit and decide whether to retain it within the corporation or 
divest it. The selling of units that do not seem to “fit” should bring about greater 
synergy for the firm. This same logic can be applied in a personal finance situation 
as well. An important question that comes up for families with two working parents 
and young children is whether one of the working adults should stay at home or 
whether the family should use child-care services.
Assume that Ted and Maggie Smith have two young children who need child￾care services. Currently, Maggie is a stay-at-home mother but could go back to her 
former job as a marketing analyst. She estimates that she could earn $3,800 per 
month gross, including her employer’s 401(k) contributions. She will receive 
monthly employer-paid benefits that include health insurance, life insurance, and 
pension contributions totaling $1,200.
Maggie expects her federal and state income taxes to total about $1,300 per 
month. The Smiths have calculated that total additional expenses such as child care, 
clothing, personal expenses, meals away from home, and transportation related to 
Maggie’s job could total $1,400 per month.
Does it make economic sense for the Smiths to hire child care and have Maggie 
return to work? To answer this question, calculate the net income or loss from her

Why This Chapter Matters to You
In your professional life
Accounting You need to understand the tax rules for multinational compa￾nies, how to prepare consolidated financial statements for subsidiary companies, 
and how to account for international items in financial statements.
informAtion SYStemS You need to understand that if the firm undertakes 
foreign operations, it will need systems that track investments and operations in 
another currency and their fluctuations against the domestic currency.
mAnAgement You need to understand both the opportunities and the risks 
involved in international operations, the possible role of international financial 
markets in raising capital, and the basic hedging strategies that multinational 
companies can use to protect themselves against exchange rate risk.
mArketing You need to understand the potential for expanding into 
international markets and the ways of doing so (exports, foreign direct invest￾ment, mergers, and joint ventures); also, you should know how investment cash 
flows in foreign projects will be measured.
operAtionS You need to understand the costs and benefits of moving opera￾tions offshore and/or buying equipment, parts, and inventory in foreign markets. 
Such an understanding will allow you to participate in the firm’s decisions with 
regard to international operations.
In your personal life Your direct involvement in the global market￾place is most likely to result from expenditures 
made during foreign travel. in addition, you may invest directly or indirectly (via 
mutual funds) in the stocks of foreign companies. probably the greatest personal 
benefit gained from this chapter is an understanding of exchange rates, which 
can significantly impact foreign expenditures, purchases, and investment returns.812
Kiwis Flying High on Currency Gains
O
n March 1, 2013, Air New Zealand reported 
an increase in profits of 28 percent, or roughly 
$100 million, even though its operating revenues were 
up only a little more than 4 percent. Analysts who dug 
into the airline’s financial reports discovered a key 
driver of the profit turnaround. In the previous reporting 
period, Air New Zealand reported a loss on its cur￾rency hedging program of $46 million. In the current 
period, however, the airline’s hedging program added $3 million to the bottom line. In other 
words, from one reporting cycle to the next, Air New Zealand’s currency hedging program 
accounted for $49 million of the $100 million increase in profits.
Nearly all large companies today engage in business transactions in multiple currencies and 
are therefore exposed to currency risk. Most companies attempt to hedge this risk by trading finan￾cial instruments such as forward contracts, futures contracts, and options. Typically, these trades are 
not designed to increase or decrease a firm’s profits, but rather to insulate profits from currency 
swings. However, to decide how many financial instruments it should buy to hedge its currency ex￾posure, a firm must estimate the value of revenues it will receive and expenses it will pay in multiple 
currencies. These estimates are inevitably imperfect, so at times companies will have unexpected 
currency gains or losses from their hedging programs.

 19.1 The Multinational Company 
and Its Environment
In recent years, as world markets have become more interdependent, interna￾tional finance has become an increasingly important element in the management 
of multinational companies (MNCs). Since World War II, an increasing number 
of firms, including many based in emerging or developing countries, have become 
MNCs (also referred to as global firms or transnational corporations) by devel￾oping targeted overseas markets, mainly through foreign direct investment 
(FDI)—that is, by establishing foreign subsidiaries or affiliates—and via mergers 
and acquisitions. The general principles of managerial finance apply to the man￾agement of MNCs as well as to purely domestic firms. However, certain factors 
unique to the international setting tend to complicate the financial management 
of multinational companies. A simple comparison between a domestic U.S. firm 
(firm A) and a U.S.-based MNC (firm B), as illustrated in Table 19.1, indicates 
the influence of some of the international factors on MNCs’ operations.
Multinationals face a variety of laws and restrictions when operating in dif￾ferent nation-states. The legal and economic complexities existing in this environ￾ment are significantly different from those a domestic firm would face. Here we 
take a brief look at that environment, starting with key trading blocs.
KEY TRAdING BLOCS
In late 1992, the presidents of the United States and Mexico and the prime minis￾ter of Canada signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The 
U.S. Congress ratified NAFTA in November 1993. This trade pact simply mir￾rors the underlying economic reality that Canada and Mexico are among the 
largest U.S. trading partners. In 2003 and 2004, the United States signed a

the stock of one firm, it is not 
wise for a firm to invest in only 
one market. By having opera￾tions in many markets, firms 
can smooth out some of the cy￾clic changes that occur in each 
market.

American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), with the Dominican Republic and 
five Central American countries (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, 
and Nicaragua).
The European Union, or EU, has been in existence since 1957. It has a cur￾rent membership of 28 nations. With a total population estimated at more than 
500 million (compared with the U.S. population of about 311 million) and an 
overall gross domestic product exceeding that of the United States, the EU is a 
significant global economic force. The countries of Western Europe opened a 
new era of free trade within the union when intraregional tariff barriers fell at the 
end of 1992. This transformation is commonly called the European Open Mar￾ket. Although the EU has managed to reach agreement on most economic, mon￾etary, financial, and legal provisions, debates continue on certain other aspects 
(some key), including those related to automobile production and imports, mon￾etary union, taxes, and workers’ rights.
As a result of the Maastricht Treaty of 1991, 12 EU nations adopted a single 
currency, the euro, as a continent-wide medium of exchange. Beginning January 
1, 2002, those 12 EU nations switched to a single set of euro bills and coins, caus￾ing the national currencies of all 12 countries participating in monetary union to 
slowly disappear in the following months. As of 2013, the euro was being used 
by 17 member countries as their national currency.
At the same time that the European Union implemented monetary union 
(which also involved creating a new European Central Bank), the EU experienced 
a wave of new applicants, resulting in the May 1, 2004, admission of ten and the 
January 1, 2007, admission of two new members from Eastern Europe and the 
Mediterranean region. The rapidly emerging new community of Europe offers 
both challenges and opportunities to a variety of players, including multinational 
firms. MNCs today face heightened levels of competition when operating inside 
the EU. As more of the existing restrictions and regulations are eliminated, for 
instance, U.S. multinationals will have to face other MNCs, some from within the 
EU itself.
In addition to NAFTA and the EU, a number of other bilateral or regional 
trading blocs have emerged. The EU itself has entered into trade accords involv￾ing at least 35 countries. Latin America has several such blocs, including its larg￾est, Mercosur, which is composed of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and 
Venezuela. It has a population of more than 250 million and a combined eco￾nomic size of about US$1.1 trillion. An even larger bloc exists in the form of 
ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), with ten members. In 2010, 
the ASEAN–China Free Trade Area (ACFTA) was established among the ten 
member states of the ASEAN and the People’s Republic of China. ACFTA is the 
largest free trade area in terms of population and third largest in terms of nomi￾nal GDP. It will comprise a regional free market encompassing more than 1.8 
billion people by 2015. Other trading agreements involving Japan, India, South 
Korea, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and various nations in Africa either 
have been completed or are under negotiation.
These deals will result in an increasing share of world trade being covered by 
regional accords. Meanwhile, an unintended consequence is the emergence of 
contradictions and incompatibilities vis-á-vis the multilateral-based system em￾bedded in WTO (discussed in the next section), all of which will force the multi￾nationals to navigate through a rising number of trade agreements worldwide.

Despite the challenges, though, U.S. companies can benefit from the formation of 
regional and bilateral trade pacts, but only if they are prepared to exploit them. 
They must offer a desirable mix of products to a collection of varied consumers 
and be ready to take advantage of a variety of currencies and of financial markets 
and instruments (such as the Euroequities discussed later in this chapter). They 
must staff their operations with the appropriate combination of local and foreign 
personnel and, when necessary, enter into joint ventures and strategic alliances.
GATT ANd ThE WTO
Although it may seem that the world is splitting into a handful of trading blocs, 
that scenario is less of a danger than it may appear to be because many interna￾tional treaties are in force that guarantee relatively open access to at least the 
largest economies. The most important such treaty is the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In 1994, Congress ratified the most recent version of 
this treaty, which has governed world trade throughout most of the postwar era. 
The current agreement extends free-trading rules to broad areas of economic ac￾tivity—such as agriculture, financial services, and intellectual property rights—
that had not previously been covered by international treaty and were thus effec￾tively off-limits to foreign competition.
The 1994 GATT treaty also established a new international body, the World 
Trade Organization (WTO), to police world trading practices and to mediate dis￾putes between member countries. The WTO began operating in January 1995. In 
2004, preliminary approvals were granted for an eventual membership of the Rus￾sian Federation in the WTO. In December 2001, the People’s Republic of China 
was, after years of controversy, granted membership. As of 2013, the WTO had 
159 members. Given the emergence of more bilateral and regional trade accords, 
however, its long-term prospects and effectiveness are becoming increasingly 
clouded. Key evidence is the organization’s inability to achieve final agreement on 
the global round of trade negotiations, the Doha Round, which began in 2001.
LEGAL FORMS OF BuSINESS ORGANIZATION
In many countries outside the United States, operating a foreign business as a 
subsidiary or affiliate can take two forms, both similar to the U.S. corporation. In 
German-speaking nations, the two forms are the Aktiengesellschaft (A.G.) and 
the Gesellschaft mit beschrankter Haftung (GmbH). In many other countries, the 
similar forms are a Société Anonyme (S.A.) and a Société à Responsibilité Limitée
(S.A.R.L.). The A.G. and the S.A. are the most common forms, but the GmbH 
and the S.A.R.L. require fewer formalities for formation and operation.
Establishing a business in a form such as the S.A. can involve most of the 
provisions that govern a U.S.-based corporation. In addition, to operate in many 
foreign countries it is often essential to enter into joint-venture business 
agreements with private investors or with government-based agencies of the host 
country. A joint venture is a partnership under which the participants have con￾tractually agreed to contribute specified amounts of money and expertise in 
exchange for stated proportions of ownership and profit. Joint ventures are com￾mon in many emerging and developing nations.
Emerging and developing countries have varying laws and regulations re￾garding MNCs’ subsidiary and joint-venture operations. Whereas many host

countries (including Mexico, Brazil, South Korea, and Taiwan) have either com￾pletely removed or significantly liberalized their local-ownership requirements, 
other major economies (including China and India) are just beginning to relax 
these restrictions. China, for instance, has gradually opened up new economic 
sectors and industries to partial (and, in a few cases, full) foreign participation. 
India continues to insist on majority local ownership in wide-ranging segments of 
its economy. MNCs, especially those based in the United States, the EU, and 
Japan, will face new challenges and opportunities in the future in terms of owner￾ship requirements, mergers, and acquisitions.
The existence of joint-venture laws and restrictions has implications for the 
operation of foreign-based subsidiaries. First, majority foreign ownership may 
result in a substantial degree of management and control by host country partici￾pants, which, in turn, can influence day-to-day operations to the detriment of the 
managerial policies and procedures MNCs normally pursue. Next, foreign own￾ership may result in disagreements among the partners as to the exact distribution 
of profits and the portion to be allocated for reinvestment. Moreover, operating 
in foreign countries, especially on a joint-venture basis, can involve problems re￾garding the remittance of profits. In the past, the governments of Argentina, 
Brazil, Venezuela, and Thailand, among others, have imposed ceilings not only 
on the repatriation (return) of capital by MNCs but also on profit remittances by 
these firms to the parent companies. These governments usually cite the shortage 
of foreign exchange as the motivating factor. Finally, from a “positive” point of 
view, it can be argued that MNCs operating in many of the less developed coun￾tries benefit from joint-venture agreements, given the potential risks stemming 
from political instability in the host countries. This issue will be addressed in 
detail in subsequent discussions.
TAxES
Multinational companies, unlike domestic firms, have financial obligations in 
foreign countries. One of their basic responsibilities is international taxation, a 
complex issue because national governments follow a variety of tax policies. In 
general, U.S.-based MNCs must take into account several factors.
Tax Rates and Taxable Income
First, MNCs need to examine the level of foreign taxes. Among the major indus￾trial countries, corporate tax rates do vary. Although the average rates in the 
United States, Germany, and Japan are close to 40 percent, those in the United 
Kingdom and Australia are near 30 percent. Ireland has a rate of about 12 percent. 
Many less industrialized nations maintain relatively moderate rates, partly as an 
incentive for attracting foreign capital. Certain countries—in particular, the Baha￾mas, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, the Cayman Islands, and Bermuda—are known 
for their low tax levels. As discussed in the Global Focus box in Chapter 11, China 
has had a low rate for foreign investors, to encourage investment. These nations 
typically have no withholding taxes on intra-MNC dividends.
Next, there is a question as to the definition of taxable income. Some coun￾tries tax profits as received on a cash basis, whereas others tax profits earned on 
an accrual basis. Differences can also exist in treatments of noncash charges, such 
as depreciation, amortization, and depletion. Finally, the existence of tax agree￾ments between the United States and other governments can influence not only ChAPTER 19   International Managerial Finance 817
the total tax bill of the parent MNC but also its international operations and fi￾nancial activities.
Tax Rules
Different home countries apply varying tax rates and rules to the global earnings 
of their own multinationals. Moreover, tax rules are subject to frequent modifi￾cations. In the United States, for instance, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 resulted in 
certain changes affecting the taxation of U.S.-based MNCs. Special provisions 
apply to tax deferrals by MNCs on foreign income; operations set up in U.S. pos￾sessions, such as the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa; capital 
gains from the sale of stock in a foreign corporation; and withholding taxes. 
Furthermore, MNCs (both U.S. and foreign) can be subject to national as well as 
local taxes. Obviously, these laws can make a big difference in a multinational’s 
tax bill.
As a general practice, the U.S. government claims jurisdiction over all the 
income of an MNC, wherever earned. (Special rules apply to foreign corpora￾tions conducting business in the United States.) However, it may be possible for a 
multinational company to take foreign income taxes as a direct credit against its 
U.S. tax liabilities. The following example illustrates one way of accomplishing 
this objective.
American Enterprises, a U.S.-based MNC that manufactures heavy machinery, 
has a foreign subsidiary that earns $100,000 before local taxes. All the after-tax 
funds are available to the parent in the form of dividends. The applicable taxes 
consist of a 35% foreign income tax rate, a foreign dividend withholding tax rate 
of 10%, and a U.S. tax rate of 34%.
Subsidiary income before local taxes $100,000
2 Foreign income tax at 35% 35,000
Dividend available to be declared $ 65,000
2 Foreign dividend withholding tax at 10% 6,500
MNC’s receipt of dividends $ 58,500
Using what is called the grossing up procedure, the MNC will add the full before￾tax subsidiary income to its total taxable income. Next, the company calculates the 
U.S. tax liability on the grossed-up income. Finally, the related taxes paid in the 
foreign country are applied as a credit against the additional U.S. tax liability:
Additional MNC income $100,000
U.S. tax liability at 34% $ 34,000
2 Total foreign taxes paid, 
to be used as a credit 
($35,000 1 $6,500) 41,500 41,500
U.S. taxes due 0
Net funds available to the parent MNC $ 58,500
Because the U.S. tax liability is less than the total taxes paid to the foreign 
government, no additional U.S. taxes are due on the income from the foreign 
subsidiary. In our example, if tax credits had not been allowed, “double 
Example 19.1 ▶818 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
taxation” by the two authorities, as shown in what follows, would have resulted 
in a substantial drop in the overall net funds available to the parent MNC:
Subsidiary income before local taxes $100,000
2 Foreign income tax at 35% 35,000
Dividend available to be declared $ 65,000
2 Foreign dividend withholding tax at 10% 6,500
MNC’s receipt of dividends $ 58,500
2 U.S. tax liability at 34% 19,890
Net funds available to the parent MNC $ 38,610
The preceding example clearly demonstrates that the existence of bilateral 
tax treaties and the subsequent application of tax credits can significantly en￾hance the overall net funds available to MNCs from their worldwide earnings. 
Consequently, in an increasingly complex and competitive international financial 
environment, international taxation is one of the variables that multinational 
corporations should fully utilize to their advantage.
FINANCIAL MARKETS
Since the 1990s, the Euromarket—which provides for borrowing and lending 
currencies outside their country of origin—has grown rapidly. The Euromarket 
provides multinational companies with an “external” opportunity to borrow or 
lend funds and to do so with less government regulation.
Growth of the Euromarket
The Euromarket has grown large for several reasons. First, beginning in the early 
1960s, the Russians wanted to maintain their dollar earnings outside the legal 
jurisdiction of the United States, mainly because of the Cold War. Second, the 
consistently large U.S. balance-of-payments deficits helped “scatter” dollars 
around the world. Third, the existence of specific regulations and controls on 
dollar deposits in the United States, including interest rate ceilings imposed by the 
government, helped send such deposits to places outside the United States.
These and other factors have combined and contributed to the creation of an 
“external” capital market. Its size cannot be accurately determined, mainly because 
of its lack of regulation and control. Several sources that periodically estimate its size 
are the Bank for International Settlements, Morgan Guaranty Trust, the World Bank, 
and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. By 2012, the 
overall size of the Euromarket was well above $4.0 trillion net international lending.
The existence of offshore centers is another aspect of the Euromarket. Cer￾tain cities or states around the world—including London, Singapore, Bahrain, 
Nassau, Hong Kong, and Luxembourg—are considered major offshore centers 
for Euromarket business. The availability of communication and transportation 
facilities, along with language, costs, time zones, taxes, and local banking regula￾tions, are among the main reasons for the prominence of these centers.
In recent decades, various new financial instruments have appeared in the 
international financial markets. One is interest rate and currency swaps. Another 
is various combinations of forward and options contracts on different currencies. 
A third is new types of bonds and notes—along with an international version of

Major Participants
The U.S. dollar continues to dominate various segments of the global financial 
markets. For example, central banks worldwide maintain the major portion of 
their reserves in the dollar. Yet, in other activities—including currency in circula￾tion and the international bond market—the euro has surpassed the dollar, with 
more challenges coming from other, potential contenders such as the Chinese 
yuan. Similarly, although U.S. banks and other financial institutions continue to 
play a significant role in the global markets, financial giants from Japan and 
Europe have become major participants in the Euromarket.
In the three decades leading up to the new millennium, many countries in Latin 
America, Asia, and Africa borrowed in the global financial markets. They accumu￾lated huge international debts, resulting in many financial and currency crises. 
Clearly, as the 1997 financial/currency crises of Asia, the 1998 currency collapse of 
Russia, and the 2001–2002 default of Argentina showed, too much international 
debt, along with unstable economies and currencies, can cause massive financial 
losses and problems for the world’s MNCs. The latest data from the International 
Monetary Fund, however, confirm that, beginning in 2000, nonindustrialized 
countries’ external debt (as a percentage of exports of goods and services) has been 
declining and is expected to continue to do so. Many of these nations have replaced 
their foreign-currency debts with local-currency instruments. Also, they have fur￾ther liberalized their respective economies by allowing long-term capital inflows of 
foreign direct investments, thus reducing their exposure to foreign exchange risk.
Although nation-states may have since slowed down their official borrow￾ings, private enterprises, including multinational companies, continue to obtain 
funds (and invest) in international markets. Both Eurocurrency and Eurobond 
markets are extensively used by MNCs.

 19.2 Financial Statements
Several features differentiate internationally based reports from domestically ori￾ented financial statements. Among them are the issues of foreign subsidiary char￾acterization, the functional currency approach of U.S. MNCs, and the translation 
of individual accounts.820 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
SuBSIdIARY ChARACTERIZATION 
ANd FuNCTIONAL CuRRENCY
For a multinational company based outside the United States, its foreign subsid￾iaries’ type of operations will determine the translation method the firm will use. 
For U.S.-based MNCs, the determining factor is the functional currency of each 
subsidiary. Table 19.2 provides further details on these points.
TRANSLATION OF INdIVIduAL ACCOuNTS
Unlike domestic items in financial statements, international items require transla￾tion back into U.S. dollars. Since December 1982, all financial statements of U.S. 
multinationals (with the exceptions noted below) have had to conform to State￾ment No. 52 issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The 
basic rules of FASB No. 52 are given in Figure 19.1.
FASB No. 52
Under FASB No. 52, the current-rate method is implemented in a two-step pro￾cess. First, each subsidiary’s balance sheet and income statement are measured in 
terms of the functional currency by using generally accepted accounting princi￾ples (GAAP). That is, each subsidiary translates foreign-currency elements into 
the functional currency, the currency in which a subsidiary primarily generates 
and expends cash and in which its accounts are maintained before financial state￾ments are submitted to the parent for consolidation.
In the second step, the functional-currency-denominated financial statements 
of the foreign subsidiary are translated into the parent’s currency. This process is 
done using the all-current-rate method, which requires the translation of all bal￾ance sheet items at the closing rate and all income statement items at average rates.
Each of these steps can result in certain gains or losses. The first step can lead 
to transaction (cash) gains or losses. Whether realized or not, these gains or losses 
are charged directly to current income. The completion of the second step can 
result in translation (accounting) adjustments, which are excluded from current 
income. Instead, the MNC discloses and charges these amounts to a separate 
component of stockholders’ equity.

Temporal Method
The temporal method, along with a variation called monetary/non-monetary 
method, is an alternative translation approach used throughout the world. For 
U.S.-based multinationals, as highlighted in both Table 19.2 and Figure 19.1, the 
temporal method is used when the functional currency is the U.S. dollar or a 
third currency. This method requires that specific assets and liabilities be trans￾lated at so-called historical exchange rates and that foreign-exchange translation 
gains or losses be reflected in the current year’s income. Also, if a U.S. MNC has 
a subsidiary in a hyperinflation country—defined as a host nation experiencing a 
cumulative inflation of more than 100 percent over a 3-year period—the tempo￾ral method is used. (In some countries, the inflation rates can be significantly 
higher. In Zimbabwe, for example, in early 2007 the monthly inflation rate ex￾ceeded 1,500 percent.)

ExChANGE RATE RISKS
Because multinational companies operate in many different foreign markets, 
portions of these firms’ revenues and costs are based on foreign currencies. To 
understand the exchange rate risk caused by varying exchange rates between two 
currencies, we examine the relationships that exist among various currencies, the 
causes of exchange rate changes, and the impact of currency fluctuations.
Relationships among Currencies
Since the mid-1970s, the major currencies of the world have had a floating—as 
opposed to a fixed—relationship with respect to the U.S. dollar and to one an￾other. Among the currencies regarded as being major (or “hard”) currencies are 
the British pound sterling (£), the European Union euro (€), the Japanese yen (¥), 
the Canadian dollar (C$), and, of course, the U.S. dollar (US$). As previously 
pointed out, by 2013, the euro, in circulation since 2002, had been adopted by 17 
members of the EU. It has gained wide acceptance and usage in international 
transactions, particularly debt securities issues.
The value of two currencies with respect to each other, or their foreign 
exchange rate, is expressed as
US$1.00 5 ¥98.03
¥1.00 5 US$0.01020
Because the U.S. dollar has served as the principal currency of international fi￾nance for more than 60 years, the usual exchange rate quotation in international 
markets is given as ¥98.03/US$, where the unit of account is the Japanese yen 
and the unit of currency being priced is one U.S. dollar. In this case, the dollar is 
the currency that is actually being priced. Expressing the exchange rate as 
US$0.01020/¥ would indicate a dollar price for the Japanese yen.
For the major currencies, the existence of a floating relationship means that 
the value of any two currencies with respect to each other is allowed to fluctuate 
on a daily basis. Conversely, some of the nonmajor currencies of the world try to 
maintain a fixed (or semifixed) relationship with respect to one of the major cur￾rencies, a combination (basket) of major currencies, or some type of international 
foreign exchange standard.
Every day, foreign exchange markets establish two key prices that govern 
trade in the world’s major currencies. One price is the spot exchange rate, or the 
rate on that day. The other price is the forward exchange rate, or the rate at some 
specified future date. The foreign exchange rates given in Figure 19.2 illustrate 
these concepts. For instance, the figure shows that at the close on Tuesday, July 
30, 2013, the spot rate for the Japanese yen was US$0.01020 (or ¥98.03/US$, as 
usually stated), and the forward (future) rate was US$0.01021/¥ (or ¥97.91/US$) 
for 6-month delivery. In other words, on July 30, 2013, one could execute a con￾tract to take delivery of Japanese yen in 6 months at a dollar price of US$0.01021/¥. 
Forward rates are also quoted for 1-month and 3-month contracts (with other, 
tailor-made contracts of desired maturities available to clients through the inter￾bank market). For all such contracts, the agreements and signatures are com￾pleted on, say, July 30, 2013, but the actual exchange of dollars and Japanese yen 
between buyers and sellers will take place on the future date (say, 6 months later).
Figure 19.2 also illustrates the differences between floating currencies and 
those that are either fixed or exhibit less movement over time. The middle data

For the floating currencies, changes in the value of foreign exchange rates are 
called appreciation or depreciation. For any currency that is fixed in value (with 
respect to the U.S. dollar or another major currency), changes in values are called 
official revaluation or devaluation, but these terms have the same meanings as 
appreciation and depreciation, respectively.
Floyd Gonzalez, an avid cyclist, is considering a bicycling tour 
that for 1 week during the Tour de France will ride ahead of the 
actual race. The cost of the tour, which includes ground transportation, hotels, 
and route support in France, is 3,675 euros (€). He estimates that his round-trip 
airfare (including shipment of his bike) from his home in Iowa will be $1,100; in 
addition, he will incur another $100 in incidental U.S. travel expenses. Floyd esti￾mates the cost of meals in France to be about €400, and he plans to take an addi￾tional $1,000 to buy gifts and other merchandise while in France. Assuming the 
current exchange rate is US$1.3033/€1.00 (or €0.7673/US$1.00), Floyd wishes to 
determine (1) the total dollar cost of the trip and (2) the amount in euros he will 
need to cover the cost of meals, gifts, and other merchandise while in France.
(1) Total cost of trip in U.S. dollars
Cost of tour (€3,675 3 US$1.3033/€) $4,790
Round-trip airfare 1,100
Incidental U.S. travel expenses 100
Cost of meals in France (€400 3 US$1.3033/€) 521

Total cost of trip in $ $7,511
(2) Amount of euros needed in France
Cost of meals in France € 400

The total cost of Floyd’s trip would be $7,511, and he would need 1,167 euros to 
cover his cost of meals, gifts, and other merchandise while in France.
What Causes Exchange Rates to Change?
Although several economic and political factors influence foreign exchange rate 
movements, by far the most important explanation for long-term changes in ex￾change rates is a differing inflation rate between two countries. Countries that 
experience high inflation rates will see their currencies decline in value (depreci￾ate) relative to the currencies of countries with lower inflation rates.
Personal Finance Example 19.2 ▶ChAPTER 19   International Managerial Finance 825
Assume that the current exchange rate between the United States and the new na￾tion of Farland is 2 Farland guineas (FG) per U.S. dollar, FG 2.00/US$, which is 
also equal to $0.50/FG. This exchange rate means that a basket of goods worth 
$100 in the United States sells for $100 * FG 2/US$ = FG 200 in Farland and 
vice versa (goods worth FG 200 in Farland sell for $100 in the United States).
Now assume that inflation is running at a 25% annual rate in Farland but at 
only a 2% annual rate in the United States. In 1 year, the same basket of goods will 
sell for 1.25 * FG 200 = FG 250 in Farland and for 1.02 * $100 = $102 in the 
United States. These relative prices imply that in 1 year, FG 250 will be worth 
$102, so the exchange rate in 1 year should change to FG 250/$102 = FG 2.45/
US$, or $0.41/FG. In other words, the Farland guinea will depreciate from FG 2/
US$ to FG 2.45/US$, while the dollar will appreciate from $0.50/FG to $0.41/FG.
The preceding simple example can also predict the level of interest rates in 
the two countries. To be enticed to save money, an investor must be offered a 
return that exceeds the country’s inflation rate; otherwise, there would be no 
reason to forgo the pleasure of spending money (consuming) today because infla￾tion would make that money less valuable 1 year from now. Let’s assume that 
this real rate of interest is 3 percent per year in both Farland and the United 
States. Using Equation 6.3 (page 276), we can now reason that the nominal rate 
of interest—the quoted market rate, not adjusted for risk—will be approximately 
equal to the real rate plus the inflation rate in each country, or 3 + 25 = 28 per￾cent in Farland and 3 + 2 = 5 percent in the United States.1
Impact of Currency Fluctuations
Multinational companies face exchange rate risks under both floating and fixed 
arrangements. Floating currencies can be used to illustrate these risks. Consider 
the U.S. dollar–U.K. British pound relationship; note that the forces of interna￾tional supply and demand, as well as economic and political elements, help shape 
both the spot and the forward rates between these two currencies. Because the 
MNC cannot control much (or most) of these “outside” elements, the company 
faces potential changes in exchange rates. These changes can, in turn, affect the 
MNC’s revenues, costs, and profits as measured in U.S. dollars. For fixed-rate 
currencies, official revaluation or devaluation, like the changes brought about by 
the market in the case of floating currencies, can affect the MNC’s operations 
and its dollar-based financial position.

1. This rate is an approximation of the true relationship, which is actually multiplicative. The correct formula says 
that 1 plus the nominal rate of interest, r, is equal to the product of 1 plus the real rate of interest, r*, and 1 plus the 
inflation rate, IP; that is, (1 1 r) 5 (1 1 r*) 3 (1 1 IP). In other words, the nominal interest rates for Farland and 
the United States should be 28.75 percent and 5.06 percent, respectively.

show the same British pound figures on 12/31/16 as on 12/31/15. However, be￾cause of the appreciation in the assumed value of the British pound relative to the 
dollar, from £0.70/US$ to £0.60/US$, the translated dollar values of the items on 
the balance sheet, along with the dollar profit value on 12/31/16, are higher than 
those of the previous year. The changes are due only to fluctuations in the foreign 
exchange rate. In this case, the British pound appreciated relative to the U.S. dol￾lar, which means that the U.S. dollar depreciated relative to the British pound.
There are additional complexities attached to each individual account in the 
financial statements. For instance, it matters whether a subsidiary’s debt is all in 
the local currency, all in U.S. dollars, or in several currencies. Moreover, it is im￾portant to determine the currency (or currencies) in which the revenues and costs 
are denominated. The risks shown so far relate to what is called the accounting 
exposure. In other words, foreign exchange rate fluctuations affect individual ac￾counts in the financial statements.
A different, and perhaps more important, risk element concerns economic 
exposure, which is the potential impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on 
the firm’s value. Given that all future revenues and thus net profits can be subject 
to foreign exchange rate changes, it is obvious that the present value of the net 
profits derived from foreign operations will have, as a part of its total diversifi￾able risk, an element reflecting appreciation (revaluation) or depreciation (deval￾uation) of various currencies with respect to the U.S. dollar.

What can the management of MNCs do about these risks? The actions will 
depend on the attitude of the management toward risk. This attitude, in turn, 
translates into how aggressively management wants to hedge (that is, protect 
against) the company’s undesirable positions and exposures. The firm can use the 
money markets, the forward (futures) markets, and the foreign-currency options 
markets—either individually or in combination—to hedge foreign exchange ex￾posures. Further details on certain hedging strategies are described later.
POLITICAL RISKS
Another important risk facing MNCs is political risk. Political risk refers to 
a host government’s implementation of specific rules and regulations that 
can result in the discontinuity or seizure of the operations of a foreign com￾pany. Political risk is usually manifested in the form of nationalization, ex￾propriation, or confiscation. In general, the host government takes over the 
assets and operations of a foreign firm, usually without proper (or any) 
compensation.
Political risk has two basic paths, macro and micro. Macro political risk
refers to political change, revolution, or the adoption of new policies by a host 
government, which subject all foreign firms in the country to political risk. In 
other words, no individual country or firm is treated differently; all assets and 
operations of foreign firms are taken over wholesale. An example of macro po￾litical risk occurred after communist regimes came to power in China in 1949 
and Cuba in 1959–1960. Micro political risk, on the other hand, refers to the 
case in which an individual firm, a specific industry, or companies from a par￾ticular foreign country are subjected to takeover. In the first decade of the 
twenty-first century—especially in the second half—Russia, Venezuela, and 
Bolivia were among those countries that had either nationalized the operations 
or suspended the long-term contractual agreements held by foreign multination￾als in their respective nations. Recent years have also seen the emergence of a 
third path to political risk that encompasses “global” events such as terrorism, 
antiglobalization movements and protests, Internet-based risks, concerns over 
poverty, AIDS, and the environment all affect various MNCs’ operations 
worldwide.
Although political risk can take place in any country—even in the United 
States—the political instability of many developing nations generally makes the 
positions of multinational companies most vulnerable there. At the same time, 
some of these countries have the most promising markets for the goods and ser￾vices MNCs offer. The main question is therefore how to engage in operations 
and foreign investment in such countries and yet avoid or minimize the potential 
political risk.
Table 19.4 shows some of the approaches that MNCs may be able to adopt 
to cope with political risk. The negative approaches are generally used by firms in 
extractive industries such as oil and gas and mining. The external approaches are 
also of limited use. The best policies MNCs can follow are the positive ap￾proaches, which have both economic and political aspects.
In recent years, MNCs have been relying on a variety of complex forecasting 
techniques whereby international experts, using available historical data, predict 
the chances for political instability in a host country and the potential effects on 
MNC operations. Events in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Russia, among

others, however, point to the limited use of such techniques and tend to reinforce 
the usefulness of the positive approaches.
A final point relates to the introduction by most host governments of com￾prehensive sets of rules, regulations, and incentives since the 1990s. Known as 
national entry control systems, they are aimed at regulating inflows of foreign 
direct investments involving MNCs. They are designed to extract more benefits 
from MNCs’ presence by regulating flows of a variety of factors: local owner￾ship, level of exportation, use of local inputs, number of local managers, internal 
geographic location, level of local borrowing, and the percentages of profits to be 
remitted and of capital to be repatriated to parent firms, for example. Host coun￾tries expect that as MNCs comply with these regulations, the potential for acts of 
political risk will decline, thus benefiting the MNCs as well.

 19.4 Long-Term Investment and 
Financing decisions
Important long-term aspects of international managerial finance include foreign 
direct investment, investment cash flows and decisions, capital structure, long￾term debt, and equity capital. Here we consider the international dimensions of 
these topics.
FOREIGN dIRECT INVESTMENT
Foreign direct investment (FDI) is the transfer of capital, managerial, and techni￾cal assets to a foreign country by a multinational firm. FDI can be explained on 
the basis of two main approaches: the OLI paradigm and strategic motives by 
MNCs. The first encompasses “O” (owner-specific) advantages in an MNC’s 
home market, “L” (location-specific) characteristics abroad, and “I” (internaliza￾tion) through which the multinational controls the value chain in its industry. 
The second refers to companies that invest abroad as they seek markets, raw 
materials, production efficiency, knowledge, and/or political safety.
For many people, the 
little blue “Chiquita” 
sticker is as familiar as a banana’s yel￾low peel. One of the world’s two larg￾est banana companies (along with Dole 
Food Co.), Cincinnati-based Chiquita is 
a global business with operations on six 
continents. Chiquita sources its bananas 
from Latin America, operating banana 
farms stretching from Mexico to Ecua￾dor. Chiquita is so heavily invested in 
the region that, for a time, it was the 
largest employer in Latin America.
Bananas are not the only item in 
Chiquita’s product line, but they are by 
far the most important, representing 
more than 50 percent of the company’s 
sales. Because the banana industry is 
highly competitive, Chiquita’s relation￾ships in Latin America are vital to its suc￾cess, as reflected in the following state￾ment from the company’s 2009 Annual 
Report: “To compete successfully, we 
must be able to source bananas of uni￾formly high quality at a competitive 
cost, maintain strong customer relation￾ships, and quickly and reliably transport 
and distribute products to worldwide 
markets.”
Unfortunately, some of the countries 
where Chiquita operates are unsafe 
and unstable. A prime example is 
Colombia, where militant organizations, 
such as the United Self-Defense Forces 
of Colombia (AUC), wield a consider￾able amount of power.
In 1997, Chiquita received threats 
to its facilities and employees and, 
through its Colombian subsidiary, 
began making payments to the AUC in 
exchange for protection. Although the 
extortion payments were not technically 
illegal when Chiquita first started mak￾ing them, they posed an ethical chal￾lenge. The legality of the payments 
changed in 2001 when the U.S. State 
Department identified the AUC as a 
specially designated foreign terrorist 
organization, making it illegal for Chiq￾uita to do business with the group.
In 2003, Chiquita sought guidance 
from the U.S. Justice Department and 
admitted to paying millions of dollars to 
the AUC. The payments finally stopped 
in 2004 when Chiquita sold its Colom￾bian banana operations to a local com￾pany. Chiquita settled its case with the 
U.S. Justice Department in 2007 by 
pleading guilty to a single felony count 
and agreeing to pay a $25 million 
fine. Chiquita now has the dubious dis￾tinction of becoming the first U.S. corpo￾ration ever convicted of financial deal￾ings with terrorists.

Colombia as (a) pay extortion to a

LG 4830 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
The equity participation on the part of an MNC can be 100 percent (resulting 
in a wholly owned foreign subsidiary) or less (leading to a joint-venture project with 
foreign participants). In contrast to short-term foreign portfolio investments under￾taken by individuals and companies (such as internationally diversified mutual 
funds), FDI involves equity participation, managerial control, and day-to-day 
operational activities on the part of MNCs. Therefore, FDI projects will be sub￾jected not only to business, financial, inflation, and exchange rate risks (as would 
foreign portfolio investments) but also to the additional element of political risk.
For several decades, U.S.-based MNCs dominated the international scene in 
terms of both the flow and the stock of FDI. The total FDI stock of U.S.-based 
MNCs, for instance, increased from $7.7 billion in 1929 to more than $2,050 
billion at the end of 2005. Since the 1970s, though, their global presence is being 
challenged by MNCs based in Western Europe, Japan, and other developed and 
developing nations. In fact, even the “home” market of U.S. multinationals is be￾ing challenged by foreign firms. For instance, in 1960, FDI into the United States 
amounted to only 11.5 percent of U.S. investment overseas. According to figures 
released by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis, at 
the end of 2005, the U.S. direct investment position abroad on a historical-cost 
basis was about $2,070 billion, whereas the foreign direct investment position in 
the United States on a historical-cost basis stood at about $1,635 billion. The lat￾ter figure is close to 80 percent of the former.
INVESTMENT CASh FLOWS ANd dECISIONS
Measuring the amount invested in a foreign project, its resulting cash flows, and 
the associated risk is difficult. The returns and NPVs of such investments can 
significantly vary from the subsidiary’s and parent’s points of view. Therefore, 
several factors that are unique to the international setting need to be examined 
when one is making long-term investment decisions.
First, firms need to consider elements related to a parent company’s invest￾ment in a subsidiary and the concept of taxes. For example, in the case of manu￾facturing investments, questions may arise as to the value of the equipment a 
parent may contribute to the subsidiary. Is the value based on market conditions 
in the parent country or in the local host economy? In general, the market value 
in the host country is the relevant “price.”
The existence of different taxes—as pointed out earlier—can complicate 
measurement of the cash flows to be received by the parent because different 
definitions of taxable income can arise. Still other complications arise when it 
comes to measuring the actual cash flows. From a parent firm’s viewpoint, the 
cash flows are those that are repatriated from the subsidiary. In some countries, 
however, such cash flows may be totally or partially blocked. Obviously, depend￾ing on the life of the project in the host country, the returns and NPVs associated 
with such projects can vary significantly from the subsidiary’s and the parent’s 
points of view. For instance, for a project of only 5 years’ duration, if all yearly 
cash flows are blocked by the host government, the subsidiary may show a “nor￾mal” or even superior return and NPV, although the parent may show no return 
at all. For a project of longer life, even if cash flows are blocked for the first few 
years, the remaining years’ cash flows can contribute to the parent’s returns and 
NPV. Even so, a firm might still choose to invest in such a country if it could re￾invest the cash flows in additional positive NPV projects in the same country.
Matter of fact
Adjusting Discount 
Rates
T
he discount rates used by 
the parent and subsidiary 
to calculate the NPV will be 
different. The parent company 
has to add in a risk premium 
based on the possibility of 
exchange rates changing and 
the risk of not being able to get 
the cash out of the foreign 
country.ChAPTER 19   International Managerial Finance 831
Finally, there is the issue of risk attached to international cash flows. In gen￾eral, the three types of risks are (1) business and financial risks, (2) inflation and 
exchange rate risks, and (3) political risks. The first category reflects the type of 
industry the subsidiary is in as well as its financial structure. We will present 
more details on financial risks later. As for the other two categories, we have al￾ready discussed the risks of having investments, profits, and assets/liabilities in 
different currencies and the potential impacts of political risks.
The presence of the three types of risks will influence the discount rate to be 
used when evaluating international cash flows. The general rule is that the local 
cost of equity capital (applicable to the local business and financial environments 
within which a subsidiary operates) is the starting discount rate. To this rate, the 
MNC would add the risks stemming from exchange rate and political factors 
and, from it, would subtract the benefits reflecting the parent’s lower capital 
costs.
CAPITAL STRuCTuRE
Both theory and empirical evidence indicate that the capital structures of multi￾national companies differ from those of purely domestic firms. Furthermore, dif￾ferences are observed among the capital structures of MNCs domiciled in various 
countries. Several factors tend to influence the capital structures of MNCs.
International Capital Markets
MNCs, unlike smaller, domestic firms, have access to the Euromarket (discussed 
earlier) and the variety of financial instruments available there. Because of their 
access to the international bond and equity markets, MNCs may have lower 
long-term financing costs, which result in differences between the capital struc￾tures of MNCs and those of purely domestic companies. Similarly, MNCs based 
in different countries and regions may have access to different currencies and 
markets, resulting in variances in capital structures for these multinationals.
International diversification
It is well established that MNCs, in contrast to domestic firms, can achieve 
further risk reduction in their cash flows by diversifying internationally. 
International diversification may lead to varying degrees of debt versus equity. 
Empirically, the evidence on debt ratios is mixed. Some studies have found 
MNCs’ debt proportions to be higher than those of domestic firms. Other studies 
have concluded the opposite, citing imperfections in certain foreign markets, po￾litical risk factors, and complexities in the international financial environment 
that cause higher agency costs of debt for MNCs.
An important aspect of personal financial planning involves 
channeling savings into investments that can grow and fund 
long-term financial goals. Investors can invest in both domestic and foreign-based 
companies. Investing internationally offers greater diversification than investing 
only domestically. A number of academic studies overwhelmingly support the 
argument that well-structured international diversification does indeed reduce 
the risk of a portfolio and increase the return of portfolios of comparable risk. 
One study found that over the 10 years ended in 1994, a diversified portfolio 
Personal Finance Example 19.5 ▶
MyFinancelab Solution 
Video832 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
consisting of 70% domestic and 30% foreign stocks reduced risk by about 5% 
and increased return by about 7%.
To capture these higher returns and lower risks, most individual investors 
buy international mutual funds. These funds take advantage of international eco￾nomic developments by (1) capitalizing on changing foreign market conditions 
and (2) positioning their investments to benefit from devaluation of the dollar. 
Clearly, individuals should consider including some international investments—
probably international mutual funds—in their investment portfolios.
Country Factors
A number of studies conclude that certain factors unique to each host country 
can cause differences in capital structures. These factors include legal, tax, politi￾cal, social, and financial aspects as well as the overall relationship between the 
public and private sectors. Owing to these factors, differences have been found 
not only among MNCs based in various countries but also among the foreign 
subsidiaries of an MNC. However, because no one capital structure is ideal for 
all MNCs, each multinational has to consider a set of global and domestic factors 
There is nothing like an 
extended stay in a for￾eign country to get a different perspective 
on world events, and there are sound 
career-enhancing reasons to work 
abroad. International experience can 
give you a competitive edge and may be 
vital to career advancement. Such experi￾ence goes far beyond mastering country￾specific tax and accounting codes.
The demand for employees inter￾ested in an overseas assignment was 
on an upward trend from 2005 to 
2008. Driven by a booming global 
economy, more than two-thirds of multi￾national corporations reported an 
increase in the number of international 
assignments in 2006, according to the 
Global Relocation Trends Survey, pub￾lished annually by GMAC Global Relo￾cation Services. A similar percentage of 
employers sent even more employees 
on overseas assignments in 2007 com￾pared with 2006.
As a result of the global recession, 
a record number of companies cut 
overseas assignments of employees in 
2009. Forty-six percent of multinational 
companies reported a decrease in the 
number of international assignments, but 
with the economy stabilizing, 44 per￾cent of multinational firms experienced 
an increase in the number of interna￾tional assignments in 2010. Forty-five 
percent of firms expect the number of 
international assignments to increase 
through 2014.
On arrival in a foreign city, expatri￾ates tend to live in a section of the city 
favored by other visitors from home. For 
security reasons, some executives also 
travel everywhere by chauffeured limo 
with an English-speaking driver. It is pos￾sible for U.S. executives to live abroad 
for an extended period without soaking 
up much of the local culture. Doing so 
may increase one’s comfort level, but at 
the loss of some of the valuable lessons 
to be learned from living abroad.
Oversees assignments do not 
come without some sacrifices. Long 
overseas postings can put stress on a 
family. The most common reason for 
turning down an international assign￾ment involved family concerns such as 
children’s education, family adjust￾ment, partner resistance, and lan￾guage. The second most common rea￾son for refusing an assignment was 
concern for a spouse’s career, not 
unlike the same concern some 
employees have about a job that 
requires a cross-country transfer.
Yet as globalization has pushed 
companies across more borders, 
CFOs with international experience 
have found themselves in greater 
demand. Some chief executives value 
international experience in their 
CFOs more highly than either merg￾ers and acquisitions or capital-raising 
experience.

when deciding on the appropriate capital structure for both the overall corpora￾tion and its subsidiaries. Understanding country factors can help financial man￾agers make better-informed decisions. As discussed in the Global Focus box, one 
way to improve one’s ability to understand how business is conducted in other 
countries is to take an overseas assignment.
LONG-TERM dEBT
As noted earlier, multinational companies have access to a variety of interna￾tional financial instruments. Here we will discuss international bonds, the role of 
international financial institutions in underwriting such instruments, and the use 
of various techniques by MNCs to change the structure of their long-term debt.
International Bonds
In general, an international bond is one that is initially sold outside the country of 
the borrower and is often distributed in several countries. When a bond is issued 
by a foreign corporation or government and is denominated in the investor’s 
home currency and sold in the investor’s home market, it is called a foreign bond. 
For example, an MNC based in Germany might float a foreign bond issue in the 
British capital market underwritten by a British syndicate and denominated in 
British pounds. When an international bond is sold to investors in countries with 
currencies other than the currency in which the bond is denominated, it is called 
a Eurobond. Thus, an MNC based in the United States might float a Eurobond in 
several European capital markets, underwritten by an international syndicate and 
denominated in U.S. dollars.
The U.S. dollar and the euro are the most frequently used currencies for Eu￾robond issues, with the euro rapidly increasing in popularity relative to the U.S. 
dollar. In the foreign bond category, the U.S. dollar and the euro are major 
choices. Low interest rates, the general stability of the currency, and the overall 
efficiency of the European Union’s capital markets are among the primary rea￾sons for the growing popularity of the euro.
Eurobonds are much more popular than foreign bonds. These instruments 
are heavily used, especially in relation to Eurocurrency loans in recent years, by 
major market participants, including U.S. corporations. Equity-linked Euro￾bonds (that is, Eurobonds convertible to equity), especially those offered by a 
number of U.S. firms, have found strong demand among Euromarket partici￾pants. It is expected that more of these innovative types of instruments will 
emerge on the international scene in the coming years.
A final point concerns the levels of interest rates in international markets. In 
the case of foreign bonds, interest rates are usually directly correlated with the 
domestic rates prevailing in the respective countries. For Eurobonds, several in￾terest rates may be influential. For instance, for a Eurodollar bond, the interest 
rate will reflect several different rates, most notably the U.S. long-term rate, the 
Eurodollar rate, and long-term rates in other countries.
The Role of International Financial Institutions
For foreign bonds, the underwriting institutions are those that handle bond issues 
in the respective countries in which such bonds are issued. For Eurobonds, a 
number of financial institutions in the United States, Western Europe, and Japan

form international underwriting syndicates. The underwriting costs for Euro￾bonds are comparable to those for bond flotation in the U.S. domestic market. 
Although U.S. institutions once dominated the Eurobond scene, economic and 
financial strengths exhibited by some Western European (especially German) fi￾nancial firms have led to an erosion in that dominance. Since 1986, a number of 
European firms have shared with U.S. firms the top positions in terms of acting as 
lead underwriters of Eurobond issues. However, U.S. investment banks continue 
to dominate most other international security issuance markets, such as interna￾tional equity, medium-term note, syndicated loan, and commercial paper mar￾kets. U.S. corporations account for well over half of the worldwide securities is￾sues made each year.
To raise funds through international bond issues, many MNCs establish their 
own financial subsidiaries. Many U.S.-based MNCs, for example, have created 
subsidiaries in the United States and Western Europe, especially in Luxembourg. 
Such subsidiaries can be used to raise large amounts of funds in “one move,” the 
funds being redistributed wherever MNCs need them. (Special tax rules applica￾ble to such subsidiaries also make them desirable to MNCs.)
Changing the Structure of debt
As will be more fully explained later, MNCs can use hedging strategies to change 
the structure or characteristics of their long-term assets and liabilities. For instance, 
multinationals can use interest rate swaps to obtain a desired stream of interest 
payments (for example, fixed rate) in exchange for another (for example, floating 
rate). With currency swaps, they can exchange an asset/liability denominated in 
one currency (for example, the U.S. dollar) for another (for example, the British 
pound). The use of these tools allows MNCs to gain access to a broader set of 
markets, currencies, and maturities, thus leading to both cost savings and a means 
of restructuring the existing assets/liabilities. There has been significant growth in 
such use during the last few years, and this trend is expected to continue.
EQuITY CAPITAL
Here we look at how multinational companies can raise equity capital abroad. 
They can sell their shares in international capital markets, or they can use joint 
ventures, which the host country sometimes requires.
Equity Issues and Markets
One means of raising equity funds for MNCs is to have the parent’s stock distrib￾uted internationally and owned by stockholders of different nationalities. Despite 
some advancements made in recent years that have allowed numerous MNCs to 
simultaneously list their respective stocks on a number of exchanges, the world’s 
equity markets continue to be dominated by distinct national stock exchanges 
(such as the New York, London, and Tokyo exchanges). At the end of 2006, for 
example, a rather small portion of each of the world’s major stock exchanges 
consisted of “foreign company” listings. Many commentators agree that most 
MNCs would benefit enormously from an international stock market that had 
uniform rules and regulations governing the major stock exchanges. Unfortunately, 
it will likely be many years before such a market becomes a reality.
Even with the full financial integration of the European Union, some 
European stock exchanges continue to compete with each other. Others have

called for more cooperation in forming a single market capable of competing 
with the New York and Tokyo exchanges. As noted above, from the multination￾als’ perspective, the most desirable outcome would be to have uniform interna￾tional rules and regulations with respect to all the major national stock exchanges. 
Such uniformity would allow MNCs unrestricted access to an international eq￾uity market paralleling the international currency and bond markets.
Joint Ventures
Earlier, we discussed the basic aspects of foreign ownership of international opera￾tions. Worth emphasizing here is that certain laws and regulations enacted by a 
number of host countries require MNCs to maintain less than 50 percent ownership 
in their subsidiaries in those countries. For a U.S.-based MNC, for example, estab￾lishing foreign subsidiaries in the form of joint ventures means that a certain portion 
of the firm’s total international equity stock is (indirectly) held by foreign owners.
In establishing a foreign subsidiary, an MNC may wish to use as little equity 
and as much debt (with no recourse back to the “parent” borrower) as possible, 
with the debt coming from local sources in the host country or the MNC itself. 
Each of these actions can be supported in that the use of local debt can be a good 
protective measure to lessen the potential impacts of political risk and, because 
local sources are involved in the capital structure of a subsidiary, there may be 
fewer threats from local authorities in the event of changes in government or the 
imposing of new regulations on foreign business.
In support of the other action—having more MNC-based debt in a subsid￾iary’s capital structure—many host governments are less restrictive toward intra￾MNC interest payments than toward intra-MNC dividend remittances. The 
parent firm may therefore be in a better position if it has more MNC-based debt 
than equity in the capital structure of its subsidiaries.

 19.5 Short-Term Financial decisions
In international operations, the usual domestic sources of short-term financing, 
along with other sources, are available to MNCs. Included are accounts payable, 
accruals, bank and nonbank sources in each subsidiary’s local environment, and 
the Euromarket. Our emphasis here is on the “foreign” sources.
The local economic market is a source of both short- and long-term financing 
for a subsidiary of a multinational company. Moreover, the subsidiary’s borrow￾ing and lending status, relative to a local firm in the same economy, can be 836 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
superior because the subsidiary can rely on the potential backing and guarantee 
of its parent MNC. One drawback, however, is that most local markets and local 
currencies are regulated by local authorities. A subsidiary may ultimately choose 
to turn to the Euromarket and take advantage of borrowing and investing in an 
unregulated financial forum.
The Euromarket offers nondomestic long-term financing opportunities through 
Eurobonds, which were discussed in Chapter 6. Short-term financing opportunities 
are available in Eurocurrency markets. The forces of supply and demand are among 
the main factors determining exchange rates in Eurocurrency markets. Each cur￾rency’s normal interest rate is influenced by economic policies pursued by the 
respective “home” government. For example, the interest rates offered in the 
Euromarket on the U.S. dollar are greatly affected by the prime rate inside the United 
States, and the dollar’s exchange rates with other major currencies are influenced by 
the supply and demand forces in such markets (and in response to interest rates).
Unlike borrowing in the domestic markets, where only one currency and a 
nominal interest rate are involved, financing activities in the Euromarket can in￾volve several currencies and both nominal and effective interest rates. Effective 
interest rates are equal to nominal rates plus (or minus) any forecast appreciation 
(or depreciation) of a foreign currency relative to the currency of the MNC par￾ent. Stated differently, the figures for effective rates are derived by adjusting the 
nominal interest rates for the impact of foreign-currency movements on both the 
principal and interest amounts. Equation 19.1 can be used to calculate the effec￾tive interest rate for a specific currency (E) given the nominal interest rate for the 
currency (N) and its forecast percentage change (F):

E = N + F + (N * F) (19.1)
An example will illustrate the application and interpretation of this relationship.
A multinational plastics company, International Molding, has subsidiaries in 
Switzerland (local currency, Swiss franc, Sf) and Japan (local currency, Japanese 
yen, ¥). On the basis of each subsidiary’s forecast operations, the short-term fi￾nancial needs (in equivalent U.S. dollars) are as follows:
Switzerland: $80 million excess cash to be invested (lent)
Japan: $60 million funds to be raised (borrowed)
On the basis of all the available information, the parent firm has provided each 
subsidiary with the figures given in the following table for exchange rates and 
interest rates. (The figures for the effective rates shown are derived using Equa￾tion 19.1.)
From the MNC’s point of view, the effective rates of interest, which take into 
account each currency’s forecast percentage change (appreciation or deprecia￾tion) relative to the U.S. dollar, are the main considerations in investment and 
borrowing decisions. (It is assumed here that because of local regulations, a sub￾sidiary is not permitted to use the domestic market of any other subsidiary.) The 
relevant question is where funds should be invested and borrowed.
For investment purposes, the highest available effective rate of interest is 
3.30% in the US$ Euromarket. Therefore, the Swiss subsidiary should invest the 
$80 million in Swiss francs in U.S. dollars. To raise funds, the cheapest source 
Example 19.6 ▶ChAPTER 19   International Managerial Finance 837
open to the Japanese subsidiary is the 2.01% effective rate for the Swiss franc in 
the Euromarket. The subsidiary should therefore raise the $60 million in Swiss 
francs in the Euromarket. These two transactions will result in the most revenues 
and least costs, respectively.
Several points should be made with respect to the preceding example. First, it 
is a simplified case of the actual workings of the Eurocurrency markets. The ex￾ample ignores taxes, intersubsidiary investing and borrowing, and periods longer 
or shorter than 1 year. Nevertheless, it shows how the existence of many curren￾cies can provide both challenges and opportunities for MNCs. Next, the focus 
has been solely on accounting values; of greater importance would be the impact 
of these actions on market value. Finally, it is important to note the following 
details about the figures presented. The forecast percentage change data are those 
normally supplied by the MNC’s international financial managers. Management 
may instead want a range of forecasts, from the most likely to the least likely. In 
addition, the company’s management is likely to take a specific position in terms 
of its response to any remaining exchange rate exposures. If any action is to be 
taken, certain amounts of one or more currencies will be borrowed and then in￾vested in other currencies in the hope of realizing potential gains to offset poten￾tial losses associated with the exposures.
CASh MANAGEMENT
In its international cash management, a multinational firm can respond to ex￾change rate risks by protecting (hedging) its undesirable cash and marketable se￾curities exposures or by making certain adjustments in its operations. The former 
approach is more applicable in responding to accounting exposures, the latter to 
economic exposures. Here, we examine each of these two approaches.
hedging Strategies
Hedging strategies are techniques used to offset or protect against risk. In interna￾tional cash management, these strategies include actions such as borrowing or 
lending in different currencies; undertaking contracts in the forward, futures, and/
or options markets; and swapping assets/liabilities with other parties. Table 19.5

briefly outlines some of the major hedging tools available to MNCs. By far, the 
most commonly used technique is hedging with a forward contract.
To demonstrate how you can use a forward contract to hedge exchange rate 
risk, assume that you are a financial manager for Boeing Company, which has 
just booked a sale of three airplanes worth $360 million to Japan’s All Nippon 
Airways. The sale is denominated in Japanese yen, and the current spot exchange 
rate is ¥108.37/US$. Therefore, you have priced this airplane sale at ¥39.0132 
billion. If delivery were to occur today, there would be no foreign exchange risk. 
However, delivery and payment will not occur for 90 days. If this transaction is 
not hedged, Boeing will be exposed to a significant risk of loss if the Japanese yen 
depreciates over the next 3 months.
Suppose that the dollar appreciates against the yen from ¥108.37/US$ to 
¥110.25/US$ between now and the delivery date. On delivery of the airplanes, 
the agreed-upon ¥39.0132 billion will then be worth only US$353.861 million 
[(¥39.0132 billion) 4 (¥110.25/US$)] rather than the US$360 million 
TABLE 19.5 Exchange Rate Risk-Hedging Tools
Tool Description Impact on risk
Borrowing or lending Borrowing or lending in different currencies to take 
advantage of interest rate differentials and foreign 
exchange appreciation/depreciation; can be either on 
a certainty basis with “up-front” costs or speculative.
Can be used to offset exposures in 
existing assets/liabilities and in 
expected revenues/expenses.
Forward contract “Tailor-made” contracts representing an obligation 
to buy/sell, with the amount, rate, and maturity 
agreed upon between the two parties; has little 
up-front cost.
Can eliminate downside risk but 
locks out any upside potential.
Futures contract Standardized contracts offered on organized exchanges; 
same basic tool as a forward contract but less flexible 
because of standardization; more flexibility because 
of secondary-market access; has some up-front cost.
Can eliminate downside risk, plus 
position can be nullified, creating 
possible upside potential.
Options Tailor-made or standardized contracts providing the 
right to buy or to sell an amount of the currency, 
at a particular price, during a specified time period; 
has up-front cost (premium).
Can eliminate downside risk and 
retain unlimited upside potential.
Interest rate swap Allows the trading of one interest rate stream 
(e.g., on a fixed-rate U.S. dollar instrument) 
for another (e.g., on a floating-rate U.S. dollar 
instrument); fee to be paid to the intermediary.
Permits firms to change the interest 
rate structure of their assets/liabilities 
and achieves cost savings via broader 
market access.
Currency swap Two parties exchange principal amounts of two 
different currencies initially; they pay each other’s 
interest payments and then reverse principal amounts 
at a preagreed exchange rate at maturity; more 
complex than interest rate swaps.
Has all the features of interest rate 
swaps, plus allows firms to change 
the currency structure of their assets/
liabilities.
Hybrids A variety of combinations of some of the preceding 
tools; may be quite costly and/or speculative.
Can create, with the right combina￾tion, a perfect hedge against certain 
exchange rate exposures.
Note: The participants in these activities include MNCs, financial institutions, and brokers. The organized exchanges are Amsterdam, Chicago, 
London, New York, Philadelphia, and Zurich, among others. Although most of these tools can be used for short-term exposure management, 
some, such as swaps, are more appropriate for long-term hedging strategies.ChAPTER 19   International Managerial Finance 839
you originally planned for, which is a foreign exchange loss of more than US$6.1 
million. If, instead of remaining unhedged, you had sold the ¥39.0132 billion 
forward 3 months earlier at the 90-day forward rate of ¥107.92/US$ offered by 
your bank, you could have locked in a net dollar sale price of US$361.501 mil￾lion [(¥39.0132 billion/US$) 4 (¥107.92/US$)], realizing a foreign exchange gain
of more than $1.5 million. Clearly, the second option is a better alternative. Of 
course, if you had remained unhedged and the Japanese yen had appreciated be￾yond ¥107.92/US$, your firm would have experienced an even larger foreign ex￾change profit. Most MNCs prefer to make profits through sales of goods and 
services rather than by speculating on the direction of exchange rates, however.
Adjustments in Operations
In responding to exchange rate fluctuations, MNCs can give their international 
cash flows some protection through appropriate adjustments in assets and liabili￾ties. Two routes are available to a multinational company. The first centers on 
the operating relationships that a subsidiary of an MNC maintains with other
firms, or third parties. Depending on management’s expectation of a local cur￾rency’s position, adjustments in operations would involve the reduction of 
liabilities if the currency is appreciating or the reduction of financial assets if it is 
depreciating. For example, if a U.S.-based MNC with a subsidiary in Mexico 
expects the peso to appreciate in value relative to the U.S. dollar, local customers’ 
accounts receivable would be increased and accounts payable would be reduced 
if at all possible. Because the dollar is the currency in which the MNC parent will 
have to prepare consolidated financial statements, the net result in this case would 
be favorably to increase the Mexican subsidiary’s resources in local currency. If 
the peso were instead expected to depreciate, the local customers’ accounts 
receivable would be reduced and accounts payable would be increased, thereby 
reducing the Mexican subsidiary’s resources in the local currency.
The second route focuses on the operating relationship a subsidiary has with 
its parent or with other subsidiaries within the same MNC. In dealing with 
exchange rate risks, a subsidiary can rely on intra-MNC accounts. Specifically, 
undesirable exchange rate exposures can be corrected to the extent that the 
subsidiary can take the following steps:
 1. In appreciation-prone countries, collect intra-MNC accounts receivable as 
soon as possible, and delay payment of intra-MNC accounts payable as long 
as possible.
 2. In depreciation-prone countries, collect intra-MNC accounts receivable as 
late as possible, and pay intra-MNC accounts payable as soon as possible.
This technique is known as “leading and lagging” or simply as “leads and lags.”
Assume that a U.S.-based parent company, American Computer Corporation 
(ACC), both buys parts from and sells parts to its wholly owned Mexican subsid￾iary, Tijuana Computer Company (TCC). Assume further that ACC has accounts 
payable of $10,000,000 that it is scheduled to pay TCC in 30 days and, in turn, 
has accounts receivable of (Mexican peso) MP 115.00 million due from TCC 
within 30 days. Because today’s exchange rate is MP 11.50/US$, the accounts 
receivable are also worth $10,000,000. Therefore, parent and subsidiary owe 
each other equal amounts (although in different currencies), and both are payable 
Example 19.7 ▶840 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
in 30 days, but because TCC is a wholly owned subsidiary of ACC, the parent 
has complete discretion over the timing of these payments.
If ACC believes that the Mexican peso will depreciate from MP 11.50/US$ 
to, say, MP 12.75/US$ during the next 30 days, the combined companies can 
profit by collecting the weak currency (MP) debt immediately but delaying pay￾ment of the strong currency (US$) debt for the full 30 days allowed. If parent and 
subsidiary do so and the peso depreciates as predicted, the net result is that the 
MP 115.00 million payment from TCC to ACC is made immediately and is safely 
converted into $10,000,000 at today’s exchange rate. In comparison, the delayed 
$10,000,000 payment from ACC to TCC will be worth MP 127.50 million [($10 
million) 3 (MP 12.75/US$)]. Thus, the Mexican subsidiary will experience a for￾eign exchange trading profit of MP 12.50 million (MP 127.50 million 2 MP 
115.00 million), whereas the U.S. parent receives the full amount ($10 million) 
due from TCC and therefore is unharmed.
As the preceding example suggests, the manipulation of an MNC’s con￾solidated intracompany accounts by one subsidiary generally benefits one 
subsidiary (or the parent) while leaving the other subsidiary (or the parent) 
unharmed. The exact degree and direction of the actual manipulations, how￾ever, may depend on the tax status of each country. The MNC obviously 
would want to have the exchange rate losses in the country with the higher 
tax rate. Finally, changes in intra-MNC accounts can also be subject to re￾strictions and regulations put forward by the respective host countries of var￾ious subsidiaries.
CREdIT ANd INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
Multinational firms based in different countries compete for the same global 
export markets. Therefore, it is essential that they offer attractive credit terms 
to potential customers. Increasingly, however, the maturity of developed mar￾kets is forcing MNCs to maintain and increase revenues by exporting and sell￾ing a higher percentage of their output to developing countries. Given the risks 
associated with these buyers, as partly evidenced by their lack of a major 
(hard) currency, the MNC must use a variety of tools to protect such revenues. 
In addition to the use of hedging and various asset and liability adjustments 
(described earlier), MNCs should seek the backing of their respective govern￾ments in both identifying target markets and extending credit. Multinationals 
based in a number of Western European nations and those based in Japan 
benefit from extensive involvement of government agencies that provide them 
with the needed service and financial support. For U.S.-based MNCs, govern￾ment agencies such as the Export-Import Bank do not provide a comparable 
level of support.
In terms of inventory management, MNCs must consider a number of factors 
related to both economics and politics. In addition to maintaining the appropri￾ate level of inventory in various locations around the world, a multinational firm 
must deal with exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, nontariff barriers, integration 
schemes such as the EU, and other rules and regulations. Politically, inventories 
could be subjected to wars, expropriations, blockages, and other forms of gov￾ernment intervention.ChAPTER 19   International Managerial Finance 841

 19.6 Mergers and Joint Ventures
The motives for domestic mergers—growth or diversification, synergy, fund raising, 
increased managerial skill or technology, tax considerations, increased ownership 
liquidity, and defense against takeover—are all applicable to MNCs’ international 
mergers and joint ventures. We should also consider several additional points.
First, international mergers and joint ventures, especially those involving Eu￾ropean firms acquiring assets in the United States, increased significantly begin￾ning in the 1980s. MNCs based in Western Europe, Japan, and North America 
are numerous. Moreover, a fast-growing group of MNCs has emerged in the past 
two decades, some based in the so-called newly industrialized countries (includ￾ing Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and China’s Hong Kong) and others oper￾ating from emerging nations (such as Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Israel, China, 
Malaysia, Thailand, and India). Even though many of these companies were hit 
hard by economic and currency crises (Asia in 1997, Russia in 1998, and Latin 
America in 2001–2003), top firms from these and other countries have been able 
to survive and even prosper. Additionally, many Western companies have taken 
advantage of temporary weakness in these economies to buy into companies that 
were previously off-limits to foreign investors, which has further added to the 
number and value of international mergers.
The U.S. economy is among the largest recipients of FDI inflows. Most of the 
foreign direct investors in the United States come from seven countries: the United 
Kingdom, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Japan, Switzerland, and Germany. 
The available data indicate that in terms of the method of entry—namely mergers 
and acquisitions (M&A) versus “establishments”—an overwhelming share of 
outlays committed by foreign multinationals in the United States between 1980 
and 2006 consisted of M&A. These firms prefer M&A through which they can 
target U.S. companies for their advanced technology (for example, biotechnology 
firms), worldwide brands (restaurant chains and food products), entertainment/
media (theme parks), and financial institutions (investment banks). In contrast, in 
most emerging/developing nations (including China), FDI inflows take place pri￾marily via establishments.
Although the United States remains one of the most “open” countries to FDI 
inflows, some of its actions in recent years have been viewed as less than welcom￾ing. In 2005, for example, the U.S. government opposed a bid by a Chinese state￾owned oil company (CNOOC) to purchase an American one (UNOCAL), which 
led to the ultimate withdrawal of the offer. Then, in 2005 and 2006, similar 
LG 6842 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
opposition, along with an identical outcome, took place in relation to a bid by a 
firm owned by the government of Dubai (in the United Arab Emirates) to acquire 
port operations in the United States.
Another trend is the current increase in the number of joint ventures between 
companies based in Japan and firms domiciled elsewhere in the industrialized 
world, especially U.S.-based MNCs. In the eyes of some U.S. corporate execu￾tives, such business ventures are viewed as a “ticket into the Japanese market” as 
well as a way to curb a potentially tough competitor.
Developing countries, too, have been attracting foreign direct investments in 
many industries. Meanwhile, a number of these nations have adopted specific 
policies and regulations aimed at controlling the inflows of foreign investments, a 
major provision being the 49 percent ownership limitation applied to MNCs. Of 
course, international competition among MNCs has benefited some developing 
countries in their attempts to extract concessions from the multinationals. How￾ever, an increasing number of such nations have shown greater flexibility in their 
recent dealings with MNCs as multinationals have become more reluctant to 
form joint ventures under the stated conditions. Furthermore, it is likely that as 
more developing countries recognize the need for foreign capital and technology, 
they will show even greater flexibility in their agreements with MNCs.
A final point relates to the existence of international holding companies. 
Places such as Liechtenstein and Panama have long been considered promising 
spots for forming holding companies because of their favorable legal, corporate, 
and tax environments. International holding companies control many business 
entities in the form of subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures, and other agree￾ments. For international legal (especially tax-related) reasons as well as anonym￾ity, such holding companies have become increasingly popular in recent years.

19–16 What are some of the major reasons for the rapid expansion in interna￾tional mergers and joint ventures of firms?
Summary
FOCuS ON VALuE
The growing interdependence of world markets has increased the importance of 
international finance in managing the multinational company (MNC). As a re￾sult, the financial manager must deal with international issues related to taxes, 
financial markets, accounting and profit measurement and repatriation, ex￾change rate risks caused by doing business in more than one currency, political 
risks, financing (both debt and equity) and capital structure, short-term financ￾ing, cash management issues related to hedging and adjustments in operations, 
and merger and joint-venture opportunities.
The complexity of each of these issues is significantly greater for the multina￾tional firm than for a purely domestic firm. Consequently, the financial manager 
must approach actions and decisions in the multinational firm using both standard ChAPTER 19   International Managerial Finance 843
financial tools and techniques and additional procedures that recognize the legal, 
institutional, and operating differences that exist in the multinational environ￾ment. Just as in a purely domestic firm, action should be undertaken only after the 
financial manager has determined that it will contribute to the parent company’s 
overall goal of maximizing the owners’ wealth as reflected in its share price.
REVIEW OF LEARNING GOALS
Understand the major factors that influence the financial operations of 
multinational companies (MNCs). Important international trading blocs 
emerged in the 1990s: one in the Americas as a result of NAFTA; the European 
Union (EU); and Mercosur in South America. The EU is becoming even more 
competitive as it achieves monetary union and many of its members use the euro 
as a single currency. Free trade among the largest economic powers is governed 
by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and is policed by the 
World Trade Organization (WTO).
Setting up operations in foreign countries can entail special problems related 
to the legal form of business organization chosen, the degree of ownership al￾lowed by the host country, and possible restrictions and regulations on the 
return of capital and profits. Taxation of multinational companies is a complex 
issue because of the existence of varying tax rates, differing definitions of tax￾able income, measurement differences, and tax treaties.
The existence and expansion of dollars held outside the United States have 
contributed to the development of a major international financial market, the 
Euromarket. The large international banks, developing and industrialized nations, 
and multinational companies participate as borrowers and lenders in this market.
Describe the key differences between purely domestic and international 
financial statements: consolidation, translation of individual accounts, and 
international profits. Regulations that apply to international operations compli￾cate the preparation of foreign-based financial statements. Rulings in the United 
States require the determination for translation purposes of the functional cur￾rency used in the operations of a foreign subsidiary. Individual accounts of sub￾sidiaries must be translated back into U.S. dollars using the procedures outlined 
in FASB No. 52 and/or the temporal method. This standard also requires that 
only certain transactional gains or losses from international operations be in￾cluded in the U.S. parent’s income statement.
Discuss exchange rate risk and political risk, and explain how MNCs 
manage them. Economic exposure from exchange rate risk results from the ex￾istence of different currencies and their impact on the value of foreign opera￾tions. Long-term changes in foreign exchange rates result primarily from differ￾ing inflation rates in the two countries. The money markets, the forward 
(futures) markets, and the foreign-currency options markets can be used to 
hedge foreign exchange exposure. Political risks stem mainly from the implica￾tions of political instability for the assets and operations of MNCs. MNCs can 
employ negative, external, and positive approaches to cope with political risk.
Describe foreign direct investment, investment cash flows and decisions, 
the MNCs’ capital structure, and the international debt and equity instruments 
LG 1
LG 2
LG 4
LG 3844 PART 8   Special Topics in Managerial Finance
available to MNCs. Foreign direct investment (FDI) involves an MNC’s transfer 
of capital, managerial, and technical assets from its home country to the host 
country. The investment cash flows of FDIs are subject to a variety of factors, in￾cluding taxes in host countries, regulations that may block the repatriation of 
MNCs’ cash flow, various business and financial risks, and the application of a 
local cost of capital.
The capital structures of MNCs differ from those of purely domestic firms 
because of the MNCs’ access to the Euromarket and the financial instruments it 
offers, their ability to reduce risk in their cash flows through international diver￾sification, and the impact of factors unique to each host country. MNCs can raise 
long-term debt by issuing international bonds in various currencies. Foreign 
bonds are sold primarily in the country of the currency of issue; Eurobonds are 
sold primarily in countries other than the country of the issue’s currency. MNCs 
can raise equity through sale of shares in international capital markets or through 
joint ventures. In establishing foreign subsidiaries, it may be more advantageous 
to issue debt than MNC-owned equity.
Discuss the role of the Eurocurrency market in short-term borrowing and 
investing (lending) and the basics of international cash, credit, and inventory 
management. Eurocurrency markets allow multinationals to invest (lend) and 
raise (borrow) short-term funds in a variety of currencies and to protect them￾selves against exchange rate risk. MNCs consider effective interest rates, which 
take into account currency fluctuations, in making investment and borrowing 
decisions. MNCs invest in the currency with the highest effective rate and bor￾row in the currency with the lowest effective rate. MNCs must offer competitive 
credit terms and maintain adequate inventories to provide timely delivery to for￾eign buyers. Obtaining the backing of foreign governments is helpful to MNCs 
in effectively managing credit and inventory.
Review recent trends in international mergers and joint ventures. Interna￾tional mergers and joint ventures, including international holding companies, in￾creased significantly beginning in the 1980s. Special factors affecting these merg￾ers include economic and trade conditions and various regulations imposed on

 ST19–1 Tax credits A U.S.-based MNC has a foreign subsidiary that earns $150,000 before 
local taxes, with all the after-tax funds to be available to the parent in the form of 
dividends. The applicable taxes consist of a 32% foreign income tax rate, a foreign 
dividend withholding tax rate of 8%, and a U.S. tax rate of 34%. Calculate the net 
funds available to the parent MNC if:
a. Foreign taxes can be applied as a credit against the MNC’s U.S. tax liability.
b. No tax credits are allowed.

 P19–4 International investment diversification Investors use international stocks to diver￾sify their investment portfolio in an attempt to counteract the movements in the 
economies of the world. Therefore, many individual investors prefer to invest in a 
foreign equity mutual fund since it offers the individual investor the expertise of a 
global fund manager. By investing in foreign mutual funds, the investor is exposed 
to overseas markets at varying risk levels. The varying risk levels are evident in the 
economic and currency risks for the various investment vehicles. For this reason, di￾versification is ideal to manage risk levels. Funds are classified into four basic cate￾gories: global, international, emerging-market, and country-specific.
a. Go to http://finance.yahoo.com. Click on “Market Data” and then “Mutual Funds” 
to find more information regarding mutual funds.
b. Briefly explain how the following four basic categories of mutual funds differ:
(1) Global fund
(2) International fund
(3) Emerging fund

Organic Solutions
O
rganic Solutions (OS), one of the nation’s largest plant wholesalers in the 
southeastern United States, was poised for expansion. Through strong profit￾ability, a conservative dividend policy, and some recent realized gains in real estate, 
OS had a strong cash position and was searching for a target company to acquire. 
The executive members on the acquisition search committee had agreed that they 
preferred to find a firm in a similar line of business rather than one that would pro￾vide broad diversification. It would be their first acquisition, and they preferred to 
stay in a familiar line of business. Jennifer Morgan, director of marketing, had iden￾tified the targeted lines of business through exhaustive market research.
Ms. Morgan had determined that the servicing of plants in large commercial of￾fices, hotels, zoos, and theme parks would complement the existing wholesale distri￾bution business. Frequently, OS was requested by its large clients to bid on a service 
contract. However, the company was neither staffed nor equipped to enter this mar￾ket. Ms. Morgan was familiar with the major plant service companies in the South￾east and had suggested Green Thumbs, Inc. (GTI), as an acquisition target because 
of its significant market share and excellent reputation.
GTI had successfully commercialized a market that had been dominated by 
small local contractors and in-house landscaping departments. Beginning with a con￾tract from one of the largest theme parks in the United States, GTI’s growth in sales 
had compounded remarkably over its 8-year history. GTI had also been selected be￾cause of its large portfolio of long-term service contracts with several major Fortune
500 companies. These contracted clients would provide a captive customer base for 
the wholesale distribution of OS’s plant products.
At the National Horticultural meeting in Los Angeles, Ms. Morgan and OS’s 
chief financial officer, Jack Levine, had approached the owner of GTI (a closely held 
corporation) to determine whether a merger offer would be welcomed. GTI’s major￾ity owner and president, Herb Merrell, had reacted favorably and subsequently pro￾vided financial data, including GTI’s earnings record and current balance sheet. 
These data are presented in Tables 1 and 2.
Jack Levine had estimated that the incremental cash inflow after taxes from the 
acquisition would be $18,750,000 for years 1 and 2; $20,500,000 for year 3; 
$21,750,000 for year 4; $24,000,000 for year 5; and $25,000,000 for years 6 
through 30. He also estimated that the company should earn a rate of return of at 
least 16% on an investment of this type. Additional financial data for 2015 are 
given in Table 3.

b. Yes, from an accounting perspective Worldwide Rug was profitable. It gener￾ated a 20% profit ($500,000/$2,500,000 = 0.20) on its investment.
c. $2,550,000 - $2,500,000 = $50,000
d. It generated a positive cash flow, but it only represents a 2% return on 
investment ($50,000/$2,500,000 = 0.02), and it may not be enough to 
cover operating costs.
e. Given the risk associated with importing and Worldwide Rug’s ability to col￾lect on its accounts receivables, a 2% return on investment seems unlikely to 
lead to long-term success. Without adequate cash inflows to meet its obliga￾tions, the firm will not survive, regardless of its level of profits.

EAR = (1 + 0.04/4)4 - 1 = (1 + 0.01)4 - 1 = 1.0406 - 1
= 0.0406 = 4.06,
c. Ms. Martin should deal with Bank C: The quarterly compounding of interest 
at the given 4% rate results in the highest future value as a result of the cor￾responding highest effective annual rate.
d. Bank D:
FV3 = $10,000 * e
0.04*3 = $10,000 * e
0.12
= $10,000 * 1.127497 = $11,274.97
This alternative is better than Bank C; it results in a higher future value because 
of the use of continuous compounding, which with otherwise identical cash 
flows always results in the highest future value of any compounding period.
 ST5–2 a. On the surface, annuity Y looks more attractive than annuity X because it 
provides $1,000 more each year than does annuity X. Of course, X being 
an annuity due means that the $9,000 would be received at the beginning of 
each year, unlike the $10,000 at the end of each year, and this fact makes 
annuity X more appealing than it otherwise would be.
b. Annuity X:
FV6 = $9,000 * 5 3 (1 + 0.15)6 - 14 /0.156 * (1 + 0.15)
= $9,000 * 8.754 * 1.15 = $90,603.90
(Calculator solution = $90,601.19)Solutions to Self-Test Problems A-7
Annuity Y:
FV6 = $10,000 * 5 3 (1 + 0.15)6 - 14 /0.156
= $10,000 * 8.754 = $87,540.00
(Calculator solution 5 $87,537.38)
c. Annuity X is more attractive because its future value at the end of year 6, 
FV6
, of $90,603.90 is greater than annuity Y’s end-of-year-6 future value, 
FV6
, of $87,540.00. The subjective assessment in part a was incorrect. The 
benefit of receiving annuity X’s cash inflows at the beginning of each year 
appears to have outweighed the fact that annuity Y’s annual cash inflow, 
which occurs at the end of each year, is $1,000 larger ($10,000 vs. $9,000) 
than annuity X’s.

= ($1,222.22 * 0.788) + ($1,000 * 0.212)
= $963.11 + $212.00 = $1,175.11
Because the $1,175.11 value at 9% is higher than $1,150 and the $1,082.00 
value at the 10% rate is lower than $1,150, the bond’s yield to maturity 
must be between 9% and 10%. Because the $1,175.11 value is closer to 
$1,150, by rounding to the nearest whole percent, the YTM is 9%. (By using 
interpolation, the more precise YTM value is 9.27%.)
(Calculator solution = 9.26%)
c. The YTM of 9.27% is below both the bond’s 11% coupon interest rate and 
its current yield of 9.57% calculated in part a because the bond’s market 
value of $1,150 is above its $1,000 par value. Whenever a bond’s market 
value is above its par value (it sells at a premium), its YTM and current yield 
will be below its coupon interest rate; when a bond sells at par, the YTM 
and current yield will equal its coupon interest rate; and when the bond sells 
for less than par (at a discount), its YTM and current yield will be greater 
than its coupon interest rate. Observe also that the current yield measures 
the bond’s coupon payment relative to its current price. When the bond sells 
at a premium, its YTM will be below its current yield because the YTM also 
takes into account that the bondholder will receive just $1,000 back at matu￾rity, which represents a loss relative to the bond’s current market price. In 
other words, the YTM is measuring both the value of the coupon payment 
that the investor receives (just like the current yield does) and the “loss” that 
the bondholder endures when the bond matures.

aPreferred project.
Project N is recommended because it has the shorter payback period and the 
higher NPV, which is greater than zero, and the larger IRR, which is greater 
than the 14% cost of capital.
e. Net present value profiles:
From the NPV profile that follows, it can be seen that if the firm has a cost of 
capital below approximately 6% (exact value is 5.75%), conflicting rankings of 
the projects would exist using the NPV and IRR decision techniques. Because 
the firm’s cost of capital is 14%, it can be seen in part d that no conflict exists.Solutions to Self-Test Problems A-17

d. Market price = $4.13/share * 15 = $61.95/share
e. The earnings per share (EPS) are higher after the repurchase because there

c. Comparing the EPS without the proposed merger calculated in part a (see 
column 5 of table in part a) with the EPS with the proposed merger calcu￾lated in part b (see column 7 of table in part b), we can see that after 2014, 
the EPS with the merger rises above the EPS without the merger. Clearly, 
over the long run, the EPS with the merger will exceed those without the 
merger. This outcome is attributed to the higher rate of growth associated 
with Butler’s earnings (10% versus 5% for Lake).
