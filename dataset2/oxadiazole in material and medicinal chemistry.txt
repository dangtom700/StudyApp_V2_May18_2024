Oxadiazole, a five-membered heterocyclic molecule affords multifaceted electronic 
utility. As a favorable acceptor, its quantum efficiency can be tuned with functional 
group engineering. As a result, many of us are using electronic gadgets every day, 
either in the form of laptops, smartphones liquid-crystal-display television sets, etc. 
It would be interesting to know the basic materials used in such devices during their 
assembly and manufacturing. This book explores various ways by which a variety 
of oxadiazole derivatives including its isomers could be synthesized. Further, it also 
discusses its significance and practical applications in electrochromic materials 
including electrochemical reduction, color change, and oxidation status. 
Oxadiazole motifs are also widely found in bioactive drugs and medicinal 
compounds. It is one of the most treasured scaffolds for drug discovery scientists 
and biologists. Its aromatic flat surface facilitates biological target binding

with oxadiazole-based inhibitors, cell imaging probes, and medicinally relevant 
molecules. The book is designed to promote small molecule heterocyclic scaffold 
in its prodigious applications in the areas of light-emitting diodes, liquid crystals, 
and electroluminescent features. It will provide a comprehensive account of various 
oxadiazole-based molecules where the reader will find material perspective in the 
initial section and the medicinal aspects in the later section. The detailed synthesis 
and practice would serve as a combo for the students and researchers practicing both 
material and medicinal domains. Preface	 iii

Diverse Synthetic 
Approaches to Design and 
Develop Oxadiazole-Based 
Heterocyclic Scaffolds 
1. Introduction 
The heterocyclic oxadiazole motif exists mostly in four different regioisomeric forms 
(attachment at different positions) (Figure 1). However, 1,2,4- and 1,3,4-oxadiazole 
motifs are most common in biologically active compounds (Boström et al. 2012). 
The 1,2,4-oxadiazole exhibits higher lipophilicity (log D) in comparison to 
1,3,4-oxadiazole. Therefore, both these regioisomers display distinct difference 
in terms of hydrogen bonding potential, dipole moment, metabolic stability, etc. 
Tiemann and Krüger, in the year 1884, achieved the first synthesis of 1,2,4-oxadiazole 
(Tiemann and Krüger 1884). Since then, several ways have been explored to construct 
1,2,4-oxadiazole moiety-based compounds. It can be constructed from nitriles via 
a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction to form nitrile oxide and 1,2,4-oxadiazole 
species (Pace and Pierro 2009). Alternatively, nitriles also react with hydroxylamine 
and activated carboxylic acid to form a 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivative. Additionally, 
O-acylation of amidoxime in the presence of an anhydride or acid chloride and 
subsequent cyclization often generate an oxadiazole scaffold. Similarly, substituted 
carboxylic acids and their conversion to symmetrical anhydrides in contact with 
EDC as a coupling reagent can also generate oxadiazole. 
Oxadiazole derivatives possess inherent thermal as well as hydrolytic stability. 
The 1,2,4-oxadiazole moiety exists in a variety of medicinal compounds as 
pharmacophores, such as dopamine ligands (Carroll et al. 1993), benzodiazepine 
receptor agonists (Watjen et al. 2002), muscarinic agonists (Orlek et al. 1991), 
serotoninergic antagonists (5-HT3) (Swain et al. 1991). Similar to 1,2,4-oxadiazole 
regioisomer, 1,3,4-oxadiazole has also been prepared via different routes including 
through oxidative cyclization (Gómez-Saiz et al. 2002; Jagadeesh Prathap et al. 
2014; Niu et al. 2015), dehydrative cyclization (Yang et al. 2014; Tokumaru and O O O R O R1 1 N N N R1 R2

routinely used protocols for oxadiazole ring constructions are discussed as follows. 
2. Synthesis of 1,2,4-Oxadiazole Derivatives 
2.1 Coupling Agent Assisted 1,2,4-Oxadiazole Synthesis 
Carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) is an organic reagent useful for synthesizing various 
amides, peptides, and other organic scaffolds by activating carboxylic acid groups. 
One such application of CDI is to prepare oxadiazole-based heterocyclic compounds 
(Nandeesh et al. 2016). Deegan et al. synthesized oxadiazole derivative 1 
(Scheme 1) from commercially available 4-methoxybenzoic acid in 97% yield 
(Deegan et al. 1999). The reaction of O-acyl benzamidoxime with CDI resulted in 
simpler isolation of oxadiazole compounds through liquid-liquid extraction followed 
by vacuum filtration. 
Employing peptide coupling reagents in the reaction flask containing amidoxime 
and substituted carboxylic acid also leads to oxadiazole formation (Shaikh et al. 
2023). N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N’-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC) is a water-soluble 
compound popularly known for its role in activating carboxylic acid. Liang et al. 
synthesized various 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives 2a–c (Scheme 2) using EDC as a 
coupling reagent (Liang and Feng 1996). Diverse Synthetic Approaches to Design and Develop Oxadiazole-Based ... 3 
2.2 Pd Catalyzed Oxadiazole Synthesis 
In 2014, ataluren (medication for Duchenne muscular dystrophy) was approved 
by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Andersen et al. utilized a palladium 
catalyst to synthesize ataluren drug 3b (Andersen et al. 2014). The reaction employed 
3-cyanobenzoic acid as the starting material, where the carboxylic acid was protected 
in the presence of boc anhydride (Scheme 3), and the terminal cyano group reacted 
in the presence of hydroxylamine to yield the corresponding amidoxime in 94% 
synthetic yield. The reaction facilitated the coupling of aryl bromide with amidoxime, 
resulting in 1,2,4-oxadiazoles in excellent yields. The protected tert-butyl group (in 
the case of 3a) was removed using trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in dichloromethane.

2.3 Solid Phase-Based Synthesis of 1,2,4-Oxadiazole Derivative 
Oxadiazoles have also been prepared using solid support (Sams and Lau 1999; Makara 
et al. 2002; Hu et al. 2008). The chemical reaction through solid-phase synthesis 
provides high efficiency as well as increased speed of the reaction. Scientists at Trega 
Biosciences (United States) led by Hébert et al. developed a series of oxadiazole 
derivatives on solid support starting from aliphatic and aromatic nitriles (Hébert 
et al. 1999). The authors utilized methylbenzhydryl amine (MBHA) resin during 
synthesis. The reaction of resin-bound nitriles in the presence of hydroxylamine 
hydrochloride (Scheme 4) and N, N-Diisopropylethylamine produced amide oxime 
intermediate. Subsequent reaction with a boc-protected amino acid anhydride and 
heating in the presence of 2-methoxyethyl ether yielded oxadiazole 4 in 95% yield. 
The purity of the synthesized product was subjected to exact synthetic protocol. 
Acylation of amide oxime required 60°C. The remaining amount of unreacted amino 
acid anhydride washed away, resulting in a robust synthetic tool. PG NH

2.4 1,2,4-Oxadiazole Synthesis Using Oxidants 
2.4.1 DDQ as Oxidant 
Rapid and straightforward preparation of 1,2,4-oxadiazole has also been made 
possible by introducing oxidants such as 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone 
(DDQ). Parker and Pierce at North Carolina State University utilized DDQ to 
synthesize oxadiazole scaffold 5 from the corresponding amidoxime (Parker and 
Pierce 2016). A diverse set of 1,2,4-oxadiazoles was prepared from a range of aryl, 
alkyl, and heteroaryl substrates. The formation of oxadiazole involved two oxidation 
steps where one equivalent of DDQ promoted oxadiazole synthesis in 34% yield 
(Scheme 5). The introduction of another equivalent of DDQ increased the synthetic 
yield of oxadiazole from 34% to 48%. However, utilization of more than 2 equivalents 
of DDQ decreased the yield of reaction, indicating 2 equivalents of DDQ as the 
optimized condition. 
2.4.2 O2 as Oxidants 
Aerobic synthesis of 1,2,4-oxadiazole has been achieved by Zhang et al. in an O2 
atmosphere using N-benzyl amidoxime in 2013 (Zhang et al. 2013). Kuram et al. 
isolated oxadiazole 6 in 92% yield utilizing CuI and O2 (Schemes 6–7) through 
an oxidative NO bond formation method (Kuram et al. 2016). This single-step 
synthetic process could transform amides and organic nitriles to their respective 
1,2,4-oxadiazole scaffolds. Reaction yield increased to 22% in the presence of a base 
such as K2CO3. Similarly, the introduction of various nitrogen ligands was checked, 
and it was found that bathophenanthroline could increase the yield of the reaction up 
to 36%. Very interestingly, the addition of ZnI2 increased the yield of the reaction 
up to 92%. Aromatic nitriles were found to be more reactive in comparison to their 
aliphatic counterpart. CuI (10 mol%) O N

2.5 Visible Light Promoted 1,2,4-Oxadiazole Synthesis 
Cai et al. developed a method for synthesizing 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivative 7 
facilitated by visible light (Cai et al. 2019). In this method, substituted 2H-azirines 
could react with nitrosoarenes and produce 1,2,4-oxadiazole through [3+2] 
cycloaddition reaction (Scheme 8). Nitrosoarenes acted as appropriate radical 6 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
acceptors during the reaction. Also, 9-Mesityl-10-methylacridinium perchlorate is 
a well-known photo redox catalyst (PC) that promotes green synthesis of various 
chemical transformations assisted with visible light. 
3. Synthesis of 1,3,4-Oxadiazole Derivatives 
3.1 POCl3-Promoted Oxadiazole Synthesis 
Phosphoryl chloride promotes cyclization of reactions apart from its role in 
chlorination. Wang et al. synthesized oxadiazole derivative 8 in four synthetic steps 
utilizing pyridine-2,5-dicarboxylic acid (Wang et al. 2001). This synthetic process 
involved the methylation of carboxylic acid followed by a reaction with hydrazine 
hydrate (Scheme 9) to produce the corresponding hydrazide. It further reacted with 
4-tertbutyl benzoyl chloride, subsequently reacted with phosphoryl chloride, and 
neutralized with concentrated NaOH solution to produce the oxadiazole compound 
8 in 53% yield. 
To find suitable bioisostere, Mohammed et al. synthesized oxadiazole derivative 
9 as part of optimization studies (Mohammed et al. 2016). 2-Iodobenzoic acid acted 
as the starting precursor, reacting with thionyl chloride (Scheme 10) and hydrazine 
hydrate to produce the corresponding hydrazide intermediate. Further, the hydrazide 
intermediate reacted with 2-methyoxy benzoic acid in the presence of POCl3 and 
produced the oxadiazole intermediate. Finally, it reacted with 4-nitrothiophenol in 
the presence of potassium carbonate and yielded compound 9. 
In 2009, researchers at Syngene International Limited utilized propylphosphonic 
anhydride (T3P) to synthesize 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives (Augustine et al. 
2009). This one-pot synthetic step involved the reaction of various carboxylic acid 
precursors with aryl hydrazides. Substituted acid hydrazide in the presence of CS2 
(carbon disulfide) and potassium hydroxide engaged in heterocyclic ring-closing and 
forms an oxadiazole scaffold from an ethanolic solution (Kaplancikli 2011).

3.2 Pd Catalyzed Oxadiazole Synthesis 
In order to study the effect of oligomers on semiconducting properties, Lee et al. 
synthesized a series of oxadiazole scaffolds utilizing coupling chemistry (Lee et al. 
2009). These hybrid compounds could be useful for applications of OFET (organic 
field effect transistor). 
The reaction of 4-bromo-4’-iodobiphenyl, in the presence of diphenylamine, 
induced diphenyl amine capped intermediate in 71% yield. After that, it underwent a 
coupling reaction with Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 and copper(I) iodide (Scheme 11), followed by a 
reaction with NaOH to produce 4-(N, N-Diphenylamino)phenyl-4’-ethynylbiphenyl 
in 70% yield (Pålsson et al. 2010). Further coupling with Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 in the 
presence of copper(I) iodide afforded target oxadiazole compound 10 in 42% yield. 
3.3 Microwave-Assisted Synthesis 
Wang et al. synthesized oxadiazole 11 from a reaction of biphenyl-4-carboxylic 
acid with benzamide under microwave heating (Scheme 12) at 150°C in 85% yield 
(Wang et al. 2006). Microwave heating, along with solid-phase reagents, improved 
the purification process. In 2020, the reaction of isothiocyanates and hydrazides in O

Scheme 13. Synthesis of oxadiazole derivative 12. 
8 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
the presence of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) and microwave heating resulted in 
2-amino 1,3,4-oxadiazole in water (Kumar Sigalapalli et al. 2020). 
In late 2010, Liu et al. synthesized cyclotriphosphazene-centered oxadiazole 12 
in 61% yield through a three-step process (Liu et al. 2011). Hexachlorophosphazene, 
in the presence of 4-cyanophenol and K2CO3, produced an intermediate 
hexakis(4-cyanophenyl)-cyclotriphosphazene (Scheme 13). The cyano intermediate 
further reacted in the presence of sodium azide and ammonium chloride to produce Diverse Synthetic Approaches to Design and Develop Oxadiazole-Based ... 9 
hexakis(4-tetrazolylphenyloxy)-cyclotriphosphazene in 89% yield. Finally, the 
tetrazole intermediate reacted with benzoyl chloride in pyridine to yield the target 
compound 12. 
3.4 Solid Phase-Based Synthesis of 1,3,4-Oxadiazole Derivative 
The solid-phase synthetic technique is a rapid preparation tool for a diverse range of 
chemical products. It usually provides straightforward separation and purification 
where impurities can be separated through filtration. In 2005, Severinsen et al. 
developed a method for the construction of alkyl/arylamino-[1,3,4]-oxadiazoles in 
high yields utilizing resin-bound semicarbazides in three synthetic steps (Severinsen 
et al. 2005). In 2007, vinyl-substituted oxadiazole derivatives were synthesized using 
polymer-based selenium resin with high-purity isolated products (Wang et al. 2007). 
In 2005, Baxendale et al. successfully tailored a series of 5-substituted-2-amino￾1,3,4-oxadiazoles from a combination of three different starting materials such as 
acylhydrazine, sulfonyl chloride, and an isocyanate and in the presence of polymer 
assisted phosphazine base (Baxendale et al. 2005). 
Similar to conventional synthetic methods, resin-bound organic scaffolds can 
undergo chemical transformation to give a diverse range of useful products. In 
2006, Liu et al. synthesized 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivative 13 utilizing resin-bound 
intermediates (Scheme 14) (Liu et al. 2006). Later coupling of Fmoc-attached amino 
acid with thiosemicarbazide resin resulted in 1,3,4-oxadiazoles in 2018 (Abdildinova 
et al. 2018). Derivatization of amino acids on both sides yielded a range of compounds 
useful for peptidomimetics.

3.5 Iodine-Promoted Synthesis of 1,3,4-Oxadiazole Derivative 
Cheaper, accessible reagents play a vital role in executing large-scale organic 
reactions. Molecular iodine is one such reagent that is available at a low cost and 
plays a significant role in oxadiazole synthesis through C-O bond formation, such as 
during the reaction of aldehydes with hydrazides. 
One-pot cyclization of 4-phenylsemicarbazide with substituted aryl methyl 
ketone was achieved by Zhang et al. (2022). I2/DMSO facilitated the cyclization 
process in an oxidative environment and produced compound 14 in 80% yield with 
K2CO3 as a base. Initially, reaction with I2 ensured the formation of -iodo ketone 
(Schemes 15–16). O

3.6 1,3,4-Oxadiazole Synthesis Using Oxidants 
Like 1,2,4-oxadiazole synthesis, various oxidizing agents can also facilitate the 
construction of 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives. In 2015, Wang et al. reported the 
synthesis of 1,3,4-oxadiazole during a reaction of aryl tetrazole and an aryl aldehyde 
using Di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP) as an oxidant (Wang et al. 2015). This one-pot 
reaction proceeded with N-acylation of tetrazole substituent, and it was subjected to 
thermal rearrangement to construct the cyclic oxadiazole ring in moderate to high 
yields. A combination of arylacetic acid with substituted hydrazides in the presence 
of K2CO3 can yield 2,5-disubstituted 1,3,4-oxadiazole scaffolds in an oxygen 
environment (Lekkala et al. 2022). At first, this reaction undergoes an oxidative 
decarboxylation process of arylacetic acid and later an oxidative functionalization 
of imine C-H bonds to generate oxadiazole derivatives in up to 92% yield. In situ 
formation of tert-butyl hypoiodite (t-BuOI) from t-BuOCl and NaI could be useful 
for cyclization of N-acylhydrazones to generate substituted oxadiazoles (Gao and 
Wei 2013). 
3.7 Visible Light Promoted 1,3,4-Oxadiazole Synthesis 
Visible light is often considered a clean and effective source of energy; the introduction 
of visible light unravels new chemical reactions with excellent selectivity. In an 
effort to achieve an efficient method for 1,3,4-oxadiazole synthesis, Kapoorr et al. 
utilized visible light to transform semicarbazones into oxadiazole 15 in the presence 
of a popular photoredox catalyst called “eosin Y” (Kapoorr et al. 2015). CBr4 was 
used as a brominating source (Schemes 17–18). CBr4

Diverse Synthetic Approaches to Design and Develop Oxadiazole-Based ... 11 
Scheme 18. Mechanism for synthesis of oxadiazole derivative 15 (Kapoorr et al. 2015). 
Recently, a combination of aryl aldehyde with hypervalent iodine (III) reagent 
in the presence of visible light irradiation induced the formation of 2,5-disubstituted 
1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives in up to 89% yields (Li et al. 2021). Interestingly, the 
reaction requires neither an additional catalyst nor the pre-activation of aldehydes. 
Applying photocatalyst eosin Y into a solution of hydrazides and substituted 
diketones resulted in 1,3,4-oxadiazole scaffolds in moderate to good yields (Diao 
et al. 2018). The introduction of photocatalysts facilitated decarboxylation and 
cyclization, leading to oxadiazole formation. Visible light can also be useful 
for transforming multicomponent starting materials into their respective target 
molecules. In 2021, Russo et al. summarized the preparation of 1,3,4-oxadiazole 
derivatives utilizing a combination of carboxylic acids, N-alkyl-N-methylanilines, 
and N-isocyanoiminotriphenylphosphorane in the presence of 30 W blue LED light 
irradiation. N, N-dimethylaniline was oxidized to iminium cation promoted by a 
ruthenium photocatalyst. The reaction resulted in the formation of three new bonds 
(such as C-C, C-O, and C-N bonds) in the single reaction, and it could also tolerate a 
variety of functional groups (Russo et al. 2021). 16

3.8 Polymer-Based 1,3,4-Oxadiazole Derivative Synthesis 
Thermally stable polymers with no decomposition below 386°C based on oxadiazole 
motifs were fabricated by Chen et al. (1999). The introduction of poly(p-phenylene 
vinylene) unit in the polymeric backbone assists in maintaining morphological 
stability during the preparation of thin films. Later, in 2002, Ding et al. synthesized 
various copolymers by installing alternating 9,9-dioctylfluorene and oxadiazole units 
through a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction (Ding et al. 2002). Copolymer samples 
exhibited blue emission in dichloromethane with a 70% quantum yield. 
Kim et al. developed a 9,9’-dioctylfluorene anchored aromatic 
polyoxadiazole scaffold 20 through a Suzuki coupling reaction (Kim et al. 
2006). The authors prepared the monomer unit (oxadiazole) (51%) while mixing 
5-bromo-2-hydroxybenzoic acid in the presence of polyphosphoric acid (PPA). The 
oxadiazole moiety in the polymer was guarded by the bis(hydroxyphenyl) group in 
its 2-position (Scheme 19). The tert-butoxycarbonyl group was utilized to protect the 
highly vulnerable hydroxyl group before polymerization and subsequently eliminated O

post-polymerization with trifluoroacetic acid or at high temperature (190°C). The 
existence of bis(hydroxyphenyl) moiety imparted high Stokes shift owing to ESIPT 
(excited state intramolecular proton transfer). 
3.9 Other Methods for Synthesis of 1,3,4-Oxadiazole Derivative 
ȕ-Glucuronidase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transformation of ȕ-glucuronoside 
to D-glucuronate and an alcohol. Taha et al. synthesized oxadiazole derivative 
21 in four synthetic steps with a 94% yield (Taha et al. 2015). Methyl salicylate 
formed an intermediate hydrazone while reacting in the presence of hydrazine in 
methanol. The hydrazone intermediate reacted with methyl 4-formylbenzoate 
and a catalytic amount of CH3COOH in methanol, and subsequent reaction with 
PhI(OAc)2 produced oxadiazole intermediate (Scheme 20). (Diacetoxyiodo)benzene 
serves as an oxidant and facilitates intramolecular cyclization to yield oxadiazole. 
The presence of the hydroxyl group on the benzene group played a major role in 
inhibiting ȕ-glucuronidase. 
Similarly, in another study, (diacetoxyiodo)benzene was utilized for 
intramolecular cyclization by Taha et al. and synthesized oxadiazole derivative 22 
(Scheme 21) (Taha et al. 2015). 14 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry

To develop luminescent liquid crystals, Cristiano et al. synthesized 
unsymmetrical oxadiazole derivative 23 utilizing substituted tetrazole 
(Scheme 22) and the corresponding 4-bromo benzoyl chloride in pyridine solvent 
(Cristiano et al. 2006). 
4. Conclusions 
Construction of a 5-membered heterocyclic scaffold such as 1,2,4-oxadiazole in a 
cost-effective process holds promising potential as it is heavily utilized as a stable 
amide and ester bioisosteres in peptide mimetics. The chemical and biological 
behavior of 1,2,4-oxadiazole scaffolds have good potential in drug development. 
Most notable examples include commercially available drugs with a 1,2,4-oxadiazole 
motif, such as oxolamine (cough suppressant), Prenoxdiazine, Fasiplon (medication 
for anxiety reduction), Pleconaril (antiviral drug), Ataluren, Proxazole (analgesic 
and anti-inflammatory drug), etc. Several new compounds with 1,2,4-oxadiazole 
motifs are in clinical trials. 
Substituted 1,3,4-oxadiazoles are considered functional surrogates of esters, 
carboxamides, and acids. Also, 1,3,4-oxadiazole compounds are present in 
pharmaceuticals as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antiallergic, antimalarial, antiviral, 
and several natural product-based compounds. These compounds can be prepared by 
cyclizing N-acyl hydrazones using various oxidants or dehydrative cyclization using 
POCl3, thionyl chloride, sulfuric acid, etc. Additionally, introducing visible light, 
microwave technology, etc., for organic synthesis is a powerful strategy owing to 
faster and more straightforward reactions.

1,2,4 and 1,3,4-Oxadiazole 
Scaffolds in 
Designing Organic 
Light-Emitting Diodes 
1. Introduction 
Solid-state lighting materials, full-color flat panel displays, and back-lit liquid crystal 
displays are some trending targets where organic light-emitting diodes are used as 
raw materials. Secondly, organic light-emitting diodes or OLEDs are abundant in 
mobile phones. Therefore, much research is going on to develop highly efficient, 
flexible, thin displays with light weight at lower cost. Several parameters, such as 
stability, energy levels, fluorescence behavior, 100% red/green/blue emission colors, 
etc., are being tuned accordingly. 
Apart from many heterocyclic scaffolds, oxadiazole derivatives are being used 
tremendously to improve the performance of OLED devices. Materials made with 
oxadiazole moiety exhibit electron-deficient characteristics, high luminescence 
quantum yields, and adequate thermal stability. These kinds of available 
characteristics strengthen oxadiazole-based materials toward better OLED devices 
with superior electron mobility. Ideal OLED devices possess (a) a steady amount of 
charge introduction from the two electrodes and (b) systematic transport of holes as 
well as electrons inside luminescent layers of the device (Hughes and Bryce 2005). 
Introducing electron-deficient small molecule dopants in the device can augment 
the electron transport process. Similarly, the attachment of electron transporting, hole 
blocking layer alongside the cathode can boost the electron transport performance of 
the device. Tang and VanSlyke first published a report on OLEDs and their application 
in flat panel displays in 1987 (Tang and VanSlyke 1987). Later, many heterocyclic 
compounds were incorporated for tethering OLED materials with suitable optical and 
electronic properties. For example, 2,5-Diaryl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles with various small 1,2,4 and 1,3,4-Oxadiazole Scaffolds in Designing Organic Light-Emitting Diodes 19 
molecules and polymers as side chains often behave as good electron transporters 
(Paun et al. 2016). Alternatively, conjugated polymers such as poly(fluorene) and 
poly(phenylenevinylene) are well-known hole-transporters (Hughes and Bryce 
2005). This chapter summarizes OLED materials originating from two different 
classes of oxadiazole systems such as 1,2,4-oxadiazole and 1,3,4-oxadiazole. 
2. Organic Light-Emitting Diodes Based on 
1,2,4-Oxadiazole Derivatives 
Oxadiazole motifs exhibit high electron mobility and excellent thermal stability. 
Materials with high triplet energy are more advantageous for energy transfer to blue 
triplet emitters, hence useful while fabricating phosphorescent OLEDs (Lee et al. 
2014). Li et al. developed two bipolar host materials, 1 and 2, through four synthetic 
steps utilizing carbazole precursor and 1,2,4-oxadiazole as an n-type (electron 
withdrawing) group (Li et al. 2014). Both the materials displayed glass transition 
of more than 100°C in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which shows better 
stability. Oxadiazole materials 1 and 2 exhibited high triplet energy at 2.71 and 
2.81 eV, respectively. Development of high current efficiency of 13.0 and 16.0 cd A–1 
for the synthesized materials 1 and 2 respectively indicates good performance in 
terms of blue phosphorescent OLEDs. 
Taking advantage of the high triplet energies of the 1,2,4-oxadiazole motif, the 
same group at Soochow University studied organic light-emitting diodes utilizing 
materials 3 and 4 (Li et al. 2014). The asymmetrically positioned oxadiazole material 3 
exhibited good performance with a current efficiency of 22.5 cd A–1, whereas material 
4 displayed good performance with a current efficiency of around 19.9 cd A–1.

1,3,4-Oxadiazole Derivatives 
OXD-7 or 1,3-bis[2-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazo-5-yl]benzene is the 
most common commercially available electron-transporting system based 
on 1,3,4-oxadiazole units (Song et al. 2017). Tamoto et al. developed several 
oxadiazole-based dimers and trimer derivatives 6–11 (Tamoto et al. 1997). The 
attached triphenylamine acted as a hole transport unit, and the corresponding 
oxadiazole motif served as an electron transport unit. 
Wang et al. studied light-emitting properties of bis(1,3,4-oxadiazole) based 
materials by utilizing poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexoxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] as 
emissive material (compound 12–15) (Wang et al. 2001). Fabrication with auxiliary 
buffer layers might enhance the stability of the material.

Chan et al. utilized triphenylsilane-attached oxadiazole 16 to develop 
high-performance OLEDs (Chan et al. 2002). Five different devices were constructed 
using compound 16 as a blue light-emitting material. Various parameters such as 
electroluminescence intensity, efficiency, current density, and blue color purity altered 
significantly while varying device thickness and electron-transporting material such 
as tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3). One of the devices displayed the 
highest electroluminescence at 19,000 cd/m2
. The device exhibited large external 
quantum efficiency (2.4%) and small current density (674 mA/cm2
). Interestingly, 
the device can withstand temperatures over 100°C without losing luminance. 
The efficiency of OLEDs can be enhanced in different ways. One such 
process is through blended layers. Ahn et al. prepared an OLED device 
combining an oxadiazole-based electron-transporting material 17 and 
poly[2-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-5-methoxy-1,4-phenylenevinylene (MEH-PPV) film 
(Ahn et al. 2004). The addition of 17 as electron transport material improved external 
quantum efficiencies significantly. 
Wu et al. developed a fluorene-based copolymer 18 utilizing electron-deficient 
oxadiazole and electron-rich triphenylamine moiety (Wu et al. 2005). The copolymer 
displayed good thermal stability and excellent glass-transition temperature (306°C). 
It also exhibited bright blue emission in thin film and in a dilute solution, indicating 
a promising blue light-emitting response. A high brightness of around 7,128 cd/m2 
and a high luminance efficiency of 2.07 cd/A was observed when this copolymer 18 
was introduced into the OLED device. Os(fppz) is a highly efficient red-emitting 
dye consisting of an osmium(II) pyridyl pyrazolate complex (Tung et al. 2004).

In 2010, Tao et al. utilized Suzuki cross-coupling reactions to synthesize hybrid 
compounds 23–25 starting from 1,3,4-oxadiazole precursor and 9,9’-spirobifluorene 1,2,4 and 1,3,4-Oxadiazole Scaffolds in Designing Organic Light-Emitting Diodes 23

derivatives (Tao et al. 2010). Interesting observations were found in terms of 
thermal as well as morphological stability. Around 136–210°C as glass-transition 
temperature and 401–480°C as decomposition temperature were noticed for the 
fabricated devices. The EL performances of the OLED devices constructed from the 
hybrid compounds followed the sequences 25 > 24 > 23. Out of the three devices, the 
ortho-linked device (25) displayed the highest external quantum efficiency (9.8%) 
and highest current efficiency (7.6 cd/A). Structural characteristics, such as twisted 
configuration, high triplet energy, and separation of HOMO-LUMO energy level 
favor superior EL performances in the case of hybrid compound 25. 
Liou et al. developed aromatic poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s 26 and 27 from 
substituted dicarboxylic acid and terephthalic dihydrazide and (or) isophthalic 
dihydrazide followed by thermal cyclodehydration (Liou et al. 2006). Both thermal 
stability and solubility improved significantly due to a bulky naphthalene group in 
poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s. Polymer 26 displayed blue fluorescence with an 
emission maximum at 463 nm in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone solution with a high 
quantum yield (32%). The polymeric materials also exhibited high glass transition 
temperatures (263277°C). 
Tao et al. obtained hybrid oxadiazole-carbazole product 28 (with 80% 
yield) during a reaction of 2,5-diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole (at ortho position) with 
carbazole (of 9-position) through an aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction (Tao 
et al. 2008). The OLED device constructed from this hybrid oxadiazole-carbazole 
exhibited a high value of external quantum efficiencies, particularly 18.5% in the 
case of deep red and 20.2% in the case of green electrophosphorescence. 
Similarly, in 2010, Tao et al. developed another hybrid compound as 29 
(89% yield) utilizing reaction at the meta position of a phenyl ring in 
triphenylamine (Tao et al. 2010). Tuning the electron transport layer with 
1,3,5-tris(N -phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzene, the authors achieved 23% external 
quantum efficiency and 94.3 lm/W maximum power efficiency in the case of the 
constructed device. Also, the OLED device exhibited the best electroluminescence N N O N N O

(105 lm/W as maximum power efficiency), while a thin layer of compound 29 was 
introduced between the emissive layer and hole transport. Therefore, the device with 
29 could be utilized for designing excellent phosphorescent OLEDs. 
Tao et al. also studied the isomer of compound 29 as 30 for phosphorescent 
OLED applications (Tao et al. 2010). Compound 30 exhibited a high LUMO level 
(5.25 eV). The efficiency of phosphorescent OLED improved significantly with 
adding 1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzene as an electron transport layer. 
Power efficiency, peak current efficiency, and external quantum efficiency increased 
to 97.7 lmW–1, 90.0 cdA–1, and 23.5%, respectively, on incorporating 10 nm of 
compound 30 as an exciton blocking layer. 
In order to develop non-doped OLED devices with blue emitting characteristics, 
Tao et al. prepared bipolar materials with compounds 31 and 32 utilizing Suzuki 
cross-coupling reaction catalyzed by palladium(0) (Tao et al. 2009). Compounds 31 
and 32 exhibited 2.35 and 2.46 eV triplet energy, respectively. Better localization

of charges and a bigger triplet energy gap in compound 32 led to superior device 
performance. 
The performance of OLED devices can be fine-tuned with suitable structural 
arrangements to yield better photophysical and optical properties. Tao et al. also 
studied oxadiazole-triphenylamine-based compounds 33–35 for designing deep-red 
phosphorescent materials (Tao et al. 2010). Compounds 34 and 35 with attached 
ortho-triphenylamine exhibited blue-shifted emission, small intramolecular charge 
transfer, large energy gap, and elevated triplet energy compared to compound 33, 
where triphenylamine is connected through para position. OLED device fabricated 
with compound 35 exhibited 21.6% EQEmax with deep-red phosphorescence
response. 
Augmenting molecular size can improve morphological, photophysical, and 
electrochemical characteristics. In 2012, Gong et al. tailored a series of hybrid 
oxadiazole-arylamine-based compounds 36–39 through a double silicon bridge 
(Gong et al. 2012). Higher glass-transition temperature (92–190°C), remarkable 
solubility, better solution processability, and high thermal stability are some of the 
features that boost the performance of the tailored compounds. Engineering through 
tetra-meta-position and incorporation of diphenylamine scaffold led to a higher 
HOMO level (5.30 eV) as well as very high triplet energy (2.72 eV) in the case of 
compound 38. Blue OLED device developed from compound 38 resulted in 10.7% 
EQE , 23.4 cdA–1 as maximum current efficiency, and 10.2 lmW–1
max as maximum
power efficiency. Reddy et al. synthesized a series of compounds 40–45 containing 
anthracene emitter and oxadiazole units in five synthetic steps from commercially 
available anthracene and tert-Butyl alcohol (Reddy et al. 2009). OLED materials 
utilizing compounds 40–45 exhibited a rise in thermal robustness and significant

compounds 46 and 47 in 82% and 87% respectively (Venkatakrishnan et al. 2012).

introduction of Si atoms inside–aromatic conjugation facilitated high triplet energy 
as well as large band gap. Compound 52 with symmetrically positioned oxadiazole 
motif exhibited 5,124 cd/m2
 as maximum luminance, 6.9 V as turn-on voltage, 13.1% 
as external quantum efficiency, and 39.9 cd/A as current efficiency, indicating novel 
host material for phosphorescent OLED. 
In order to develop cheaper solution-processable host materials, Gong et al. 
isolated oxadiazole compound 53 with a double silicon bridge between arylamine and 
oxadiazole as a white solid in 62% yield (Gong et al. 2013). This extended designed 
compound 53 demonstrated greater thermal stability and high glass-transition

exhibited 15.3 cd/A as maximum current efficiency, which is suitable for designing 
efficient blue phosphorescent materials. 
In 2013, researchers at Kyushu University developed donor-acceptor-donor-type 
efficient TADF materials with oxadiazole analogs 54 and 55 (Lee et al. 2013). 
Compounds 54 and 55 displayed green emission response. Compound 55 
exhibited a very high photoluminescence quantum yield (87%) when doped with 
bis(2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl)ether oxide. OLED devices prepared from 
compound 55 yielded 14.9% EQE . max
In 2013, Chang et al. observed that introducing CsF/Al while developing 
oxadiazole (56–57) based phosphorescent OLED enhanced electron transport and 
simultaneously decreased interface resistance (Chang et al. 2013). The authors 
observed very high current efficiency (17.3 cd/A) and 8.86 lm/W maximum luminous 
efficiency due to effective n-type doping. By introducing oxadiazole at the C3 and 
C6 positions of carbazole moiety, Chen et al. synthesized a bipolar host material 58

in three synthetic steps (Chen et al. 2012). Both HOMO and LUMO orbitals were 
observed to be delocalized over carbazole and oxadiazole groups in compound 58. 
Introducing a green phosphor increased EQEmax to 17.7%, whereas adding a red
phosphor yielded 20.6% EQEmax, owing to better delocalization and small triplet
energy (2.65 eV). 
In order to develop robust bipolar host materials, Cheng et al. tailored 
carbazole-oxadiazole (donor-acceptor) connected compounds 59–61 by varying the 
D/A ratio (Cheng et al. 2013). Tuning the carbazole-oxadiazole ratio influenced several 
parameters such as energy levels, hole mobility, and thermal as well as morphological 
stability. Interestingly, the addition of bis(2, N-diphenylbenzimidazolito)iridium(III) 
acetylacetonate, i.e., (PBi)2Ir(acac) as emitter while preparing green phosphorescent 
OLED materials enhanced their performance. Around 20.7%, 20.4%, and 17.3% 
EQEmax were observed from materials containing compounds 59–61, respectively. 
Carrier transport properties of the compounds 59–61 are shown in Figure 2. 
Shih et al. developed a centrally positioned oxadiazole-based material 62 with 
a symmetrical structure in three synthetic steps (70% yield) (Shih et al. 2015). 
The material displayed a high Tg (thermal stability) value (220°C) as well as high 
triplet energy (2.76 eV). Several advantages of the material were observed, such as 
successful enhancement of charge balance, electron transport, blocking holes and 
excitons, etc. It was successfully utilized as a universal electron transporter for green, 
blue, and red phosphorescent tools. The green phosphorescent device displayed 
97.6 cd A–1 as a high value of current efficiency. 
In 2016, Chidirala et al. synthesized pyrene-oxadiazole scaffolds 63–65 for 
green-emitting application materials (Chidirala et al. 2016). Incorporation of 
2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane as a hole-injecting layer and 
bathocuproine as a well-known electron transport material during OLED device 
fabrication yielded 9.56 lm/W power efficiency, 13.56 cdA–1 current efficiency along 
with 5.34% quantum yield. The study might be useful for designing efficient electron 
transporters using hybrid chemical entities. 30 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry

Introducing tetrahedral silicon structural motifs in OLED materials can 
significantly improve band gap and triplet energy levels (Han et al. 2009). Silicon 
atoms enhance device performance by breaking conjugation character while 
maintaining thermal stability (Yi et al. 2015). Lee et al. synthesized compounds 
66 and 67 with or without tetrahedral silicon scaffold (Lee et al. 2016). Around 
15.83% EQEmax and 54.55 lm/W maximum power efficiency were observed for 
OLED devices containing compound 66. The incorporation of tetrahedral silicon 
moiety also improved the HOMO-LUMO band gap. In another study in 2007, Leung 1,2,4 and 1,3,4-Oxadiazole Scaffolds in Designing Organic Light-Emitting Diodes 31

 maximum brightness of the 
phosphorescent OLED device while incorporating compound 68 as host material 
(for electron transport) with Ir(ppy)3 [Tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium] (Leung 
et al. 2007). 
Zhao et al. studied the influence of the carbazole-oxadiazole (donor-acceptor) 
ratio on phosphorescent OLED utilizing compounds 69–74 that are made up of 
1,3-Bis(carbazole-9-yl)benzene as hole transport host and oxadiazole derivatives 
through a benzene linkage (Zhao et al. 2017). The authors prepared different types 
(blue, green, and red) of phosphorescent OLEDs and observed interesting patterns 
concerning ortho/para linkage. Compounds such as 69 and 70 fixed through ortho 
linkage structurally produced maximum triplet energy value (2.8 eV) and exhibited 
blue-emitting phosphorescent behavior (Figure 3). Similarly, compounds such as 73 
and 74 that are connected through para linkage displayed maximum current densities 
with short triplet energy values. 
Wong et al. developed a series of four TADF emitters 75–78 by fixing 
two carbazole units at the ortho position of the benzene derivative (Wong 
et al. 2018). The addition of hosts such as 1,3-bis(carbazol-9-yl)benzene and 
2,8-bis(diphenylphosphoryl) dibenzo[b,d] thiophene during device construction 
resulted in 14–55% photoluminescence quantum yields. Devices prepared from 
compound 77 yielded 11.2% EQEmax with sky-blue emission, whereas devices
constructed from compound 78 produced 6.6% EQEmax with deep-blue emission.
Similarly, CIE color coordinates for OLED devices made from compounds 77 and 
78 were (0.17, 0.25) and (0.15, 0.11), respectively. 32 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry

Tan et al. developed donor-acceptor-donor type compounds 79–81 in 2019 (Tan 
et al. 2019). Compounds with substituted acridine, such as 80 and 81, exhibited 
distinct TADF properties due to small energy splitting (EST) between singlet 
and triplet excited states. Acridine-based compounds also displayed very high 
photoluminescent quantum yields of up to 93% and are potential blue TADF emitters. 
Similarly, compounds 80 and 81 displayed 14.4% and 22.3% EQE , respectively. max
Li et al. developed a series of oxadiazole-based TADF compounds 82–85 from 
commercially available 1-bromo-2,4-difluorobenzene precursor (Li et al. 2019). 
Their emissive color could be easily fine-tuned from sky blue to blue. A small value 
of singlet-triplet splitting was experienced from the highly twisted conformation 1,2,4 and 1,3,4-Oxadiazole Scaffolds in Designing Organic Light-Emitting Diodes 33

between oxadiazole and carbazole owing to effective HOMO-LUMO separation. 
OLED devices prepared from compound 82 exhibited maximum external quantum 
efficiency (EQEmax) as 11.8% with deep-blue emission having color coordinate (CIE) 
at (0.17, 0.17). However, the device obtained using compound 84 displayed higher 
EQE (12.3%) with sky-blue emission having CIE coordinates at (0.17, 0.25). max
Tan et al. developed hybrid compounds 86–89 by tuning electronic structures 
around aromatic nuclei using carbazole and oxadiazole units in three synthetic steps 
(Tan et al. 2019). Sequential introduction of nitrogen (N) heteroatom in the aromatic 
structure of the compounds 86–88 resulted in reduced energy gaps and bathochromic 
shifting of emission bands. All these compounds displayed high photoluminescent 
quantum yields. The fabricated nanodoped deep blue OLED device (made by the 
best candidate) prepared by the authors exhibited 4.0% maximum external quantum 
efficiency and 4,406 cd/m2
 as maximum brightness. 
Difluoroboron (BF2)-attached compounds exhibit better electron withdrawing 
response and strong luminescence efficiency. Zhou et al. prepared hybrid compounds 
90–91 in 2–3 synthetic steps where both phenolic derivative (and its BF2-analog) 
and 9,9-dimethylacridine were attached with the help of an oxadiazole moiety 
(Zhou et al. 2019). Compounds 90–91 exhibited sky-blue emission (maxima in the 
range of 470490 nm) (Figure 4) both in solution as well as film state, indicating 
good TADF (thermally activated delayed fluorescence) properties. The developed 34 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry

TADF characteristics are ascribed to the existence of keto form in the triplet state 
of 90–91. In order to incorporate suitable host material, the authors could tune the 
external quantum efficiency of the designed OLED materials. In the presence of 
9-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-3,6-bis(triphenylsilyl)-9H-carbazole as a host material, 
the synthesized oxadiazole compounds 90–91 displayed 2.98 and 13.8% 
maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE), respectively. Interestingly, 
the EQE parameter for 90–91 increased to 12.1 and 20.1% (Figure 4) in the 
presence of 10-(4-((4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)sulfonyl)phenyl)-9,9-dimethyl￾9,10-dihydroacridine as a host material. 
In 2019, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Zhang et al.) studied 
host-free OLEDs utilizing oxadiazole-based compound 92 with diagonally connected 
four carbazole moieties (Zhang et al. 2019). The OLED device prepared from this 
yellow-green-emitting compound 92 exhibited significant light-emitting properties 
such as 79 lmW–1 as power efficiency, 10 cdm–2 as luminance, 73 cdA–1 as current 
efficiency, and 21% of maximum external quantum efficiency. Compound 92 could 
be utilized as a TADF emitter in organic electronics. 
Irradiation of light upon a charge transfer complex at its charge transfer band 
produces exciplex (also known as excited charge transfer complex) (Guo et al. 
2021). Exciplex emissive materials show promising optical properties owing to 
100% exciton harvesting, highly advantageous bipolar nature, and preferred dipole 1,2,4 and 1,3,4-Oxadiazole Scaffolds in Designing Organic Light-Emitting Diodes 35

transport materials that could be solution-processed to yield highly efficient exciplex 
emissive films. In order to utilize exciplex blends in OLED applications, Saghaei 
et al. tailored three oxadiazole-based compounds 93–95 with better solubility 
and compared their performance with commercially available electron transport 
material OXD-7 (Saghaei et al. 2021). Films prepared from these synthesized 
oxadiazole compounds exhibited greater electron mobilities in comparison to 
OXD-7. Additionally, these synthesized compounds formed a homogeneous (soluble) 
solution in the presence of hole-transporting material 4,4’,4’’-tris[phenyl(m-tolyl) 
amino]-triphenylamine (m-MTDATA). Blending m-MTDATA with compound 93 
displayed 5.3 ± 0.3% as maximum external quantum efficiency (Figure 5) and a 
high value of photoluminescence quantum yield (21 ± 3%) among three synthesized 
compounds. 36 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
4. Metal Complex-Based Oxadiazole Systems 
In an effort to understand the relevance of iridium complexes toward the effectiveness 
of electroluminescent devices, Tang et al. developed complexes 96 and 97 utilizing 
3-(5-(4-(pyridin-2-yl)phenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-9-hexyl-9H-carbazole and its 
iridium complex (Tang et al. 2011). Complexes 96 and 97 exhibited 188°C and 
201°C as high glass-transition temperatures, respectively. Polymer LEDs fabricated 
from complexes 96 and 97 exhibited very high luminance efficiency of 11.1 and 
16.4 cdA–1, respectively (Figure 6). 
Oxadiazole-type counter-anions play a significant role in performance 
enhancement in OLED devices. Taking advantage of the cationic nature of iridium 
complexes and combining it with oxadiazole-type counter-anions can facilitate energy 
transfer in the fabricated films. Meng et al. synthesized cationic iridium complexes 
98–100 with different counter-anions in 4–5 synthetic steps from commercially 
available precursors such as Sodium 3-sulfobenzoate and the respective analog 
(Meng et al. 2020). The authors obtained a 1.4 times improvement in efficiency in

5. Polymer-Based Oxadiazole Systems 
In 1995, Pei et al. reported synthesizing a set of polymers 101–103 consisting 
of 1,3,4-oxadiazole units with different conjugation lengths and solubility (Pei 
and Yang 1995). The non-fluorescent polymer 101 exhibited the largest ʌ–ʌ* 
bandgap. Interestingly, attachment of extra oxadiazole unit (in case of polymer 
102) strengthened its electron transport nature. Alternatively, polymers with longer 
conjugation lengths, such as 103, exhibited intense blue fluorescence response. The 
fabricated blue LED device utilizing polymer 103 as the electron injection layer, 
polyaniline as the hole injection layer (and calcium as a cathode) exhibited 0.1% 
EQE and 4.5 V voltage. In this way, longer conjugating materials could potentially 
increase blue fluorescence behavior. 
Bao et al. designed and synthesized hybrid polymers 104–106 by attaching 
oxadiazole units adjacent to the conjugated hole-transporting scaffold such as 
poly(phenylene vinylene) or poly(phenylene thiophene) (Bao et al. 1998). Polymers 
104 and 105 displayed two distinct absorption bands, one at 330 nm from the 
oxadiazole scaffold and the second at 460 nm. Excitation of 104–106 polymeric thin 
films at 442 nm exhibited one emission peak at 580 nm in the case of 104–105 and

at 590 nm in the case of 106. Due to hole-transporting, electron-transporting, and 
light-emitting characteristics in a single species, the designed polymers 104–106 are 
well suited for fabricating single-layer LED devices. 
Polymeric liquid crystals exhibit significant applications in nonlinear optical 
devices, light-emitting materials, and optoelectronics with interesting phase 
structures and transitions (Chai et al. 2007; Concellón et al. 2018). Kawamoto 
et al. developed a polymer liquid crystal utilizing 107, where an oxadiazole scaffold 
acted as an electron-transporting moiety and the corresponding amine group as a 
hole-transporting group (Kawamoto et al. 2003). A maximum brightness of around 
13 cd/m2
 was noticed with blue emission when polymer 107 was incorporated into 
the OLED device. In order to tune the triplet energy, Zhang et al. tailored copolymers 
108–110 using a carbazole-oxadiazole hybrid system through Suzuki cross￾coupling reactions (Zhang et al. 2008). Copolymers were obtained through 3,6-, 
3,6-alt-2,7-, and 2,7-linkage at the carbazole moiety. These copolymers displayed good 
thermal stability and glass-transition temperatures of 211°C, 194°C, and 208°C for 
108–110, respectively. Fluorescence quantum efficiencies enhanced remarkably 
with blue emissions, and the triplet energies were obtained as 2.52, 2.42, and 2.32 eV, 
respectively, for copolymers 108–110. The fabricated polymeric OLEDs utilizing 
copolymers 108–110 as host materials and bis(2,4-diphenylquinolinato-N,C2’) 
iridium(acetylacetonate) as guest material exhibited 3.1 to 4.3 V as turn-on voltage. 
Sun et al. utilized fluorene-oxadiazole copolymer 111 to develop white 
light-emitting electrochemical cells (Sun et al. 2010). Copolymer 111 is composed 
of 25 mol % 5,5’-diphenyl-2,2’-bi-1,3,4-oxadiazole and 75 mol % fluorene. N N

Attachment of 2-(2-(2-Methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethyl group at the C9 position 
of fluorene facilitated ionic conductivity. About 4.6 V turn-on voltage and 
29.4 mA/cm2
 maximum luminance were obtained from the light-emitting 
electrochemical cell using copolymer 111. White emission was also observed with 
CIE coordinates (0.24, 0.31). 
Zhang et al. developed various polymeric systems 112–115, such as 
polymethacrylates, polystyrenes, and polynorbornenes via phenylene-linked 
oxadiazole-carbazole hybrid scaffolds (Zhang et al. 2011). These synthesized 
polymers displayed good thermal stability and 118–209°C at moderate to high 
glass-transition temperatures. These polymers could be useful for preparing green 
and blue-green phosphorescent materials. The fabricated OLED device utilizing 
polymer 115 displayed 10.0% EQE , 34.1 cdA–1
max as current efficiency, and 6.0 V 
turn-on voltage. 40 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
6. Conclusions 
Organic and polymeric electronics have achieved tremendous advancement in 
the last two decades. For example, the quality of electronic and optical devices 
has significantly increased. Electroluminescent devices made up of oxadiazole 
moieties exhibit high quantum efficiencies and are suitable for fabricating organic 
light-emitting diodes. These devices find extensive applications in illumination 
and display. Well-known electron transporter 1,3,4-oxadiazole, connected to 
two triphenylamine groups as a hole transporter (as in the case of compound 33), 
displayed highly emissive OLED characteristics due to discontinuity in conjugation. 
Water/alcohol-soluble oxadiazole derivatives have been instrumental in fabricating 
solution-processable devices. Challenges include devising high quantum efficient 
materials with increased current density. A lower rate of quantum efficiency (with a 
rise in current density) is associated with loss of charge balance, exciton generation

Oxadiazole as 

Liquid Crystals
 
1. Introduction 
For the first time, an Austrian botanist named Fridrich Reinitzer noticed a twofold 
melting in cholesteryl benzoate when heated. He discovered that some compounds 
underwent birefringence (between crossed polarizers) when heated, and upon 
further heating, it turned into a clear liquid (Reinitzer 1888). These substances 
later became known as liquid crystals (LCs) by Otto Lehman because they have 
both solid and liquid qualities. The LCs’ anisotropic features can be used in optical 
displays showing mesophases halfway between solids and liquids (Prakash et al. 
2020). Their first generation exhibits that mesophase could only occur in linear (or 
rod-shaped) molecules with a finite length-to-breadth (L/B) ratio. Later, it was found 
that molecules do not always need to be rod-shaped in order to display mesophases; 
instead, non-rod-type molecules can also do so (Chandrasekhar et al. 1977). Then, 
the chiral LCs with ferroelectric nature and sub-microsecond responsiveness were 
discovered (Ma et al. 2022). Following this, chiral-containing ferroelectric LCs 
)/&VZHUHXVHGLQDYDULHW\RIWHFKQLFDODSSOLFDWLRQV*LHȕHOPDQQDQG=XJHQPDLHU
1995; Das et al. 2019). The achiral ferroelectric LCs with non-zero polarization in 
external stimuli were synthesized. Due to their efficient synthesis without expensive 
chiral components and high yields, the synthesis and characterization of such achiral 
FLCs have gained impetus in the recent two decades (Niori et al. 1996; Watanabe 
et al. 1998). The melting of these materials is depicted in the accompanying schematic 
diagram (Figure 1). 
2. Classification of Liquid Crystals 
LCs can be categorized based on the change in temperature (thermotropic) or 
concentration (lyotropic) (Chavda et al. 2022; Chen et al. 2022). Thermotropic LCs 
display a variety of mesophases as a function of temperature. They are crystalline 
at low temperatures, whereas above the melting point, they show mesophase 
behavior. The ordering of different phases can be destroyed by thermal motion at 
high temperatures, turning them into an isotropic liquid phase (Chavda et al. 2022). Oxadiazole as Liquid Crystals 45 
Figure 1. An illustration of the melting of crystalline material. 
Based on their shape, thermotropic LCs are further divided into calamatic (Cakar 
et al. 2022), discotic (Khare et al. 2022), polycatenar (Bais et al. 2019), and 
bending-shaped (Kumar 2022) LCs. The dissolution of an amphiphile in the solvent 
results in the formation of lyotropic LCs. The basic structure of these amphiphile 
compounds consists of a polar head and a non-polar tail. These lyotropic LCs 
exhibit a variety of phases when the solution concentrations change, and the solvent 
molecules fill the area around the structures to keep the system fluid (Fairhurst et al. 
1998; Chen et al. 2022). The polarity of the solvent, temperature, and concentration 
all affect the lyotropic phase behavior (Burducea 2004). There may be one or more 
mesophases present in an LC molecule. Polymesomorphic refers to a compound that 
displays more than one mesophase. By adjusting the temperature and concentration, 
the lyotropic exhibits different phase variants and hence is called an Amphotropic 
LCs. Monotropic occurrence is when an LC compound only displays a phase 
sequence during the heating/cooling process. Enantiotropic LC phase occurrence 
is defined as being reversible throughout both the heating and cooling runs of the 
concentration and dilution processes (Salanger 1999). The classification of liquid 
crystals is presented in Figure 2. 
Figure 2. Classifications of liquid crystal. 
3. Classification of Liquid Crystalline Phases 
Based on their optical textures under crossed polarizers and their X-ray diffraction 
profiles with temperature fluctuation, various LC phase types can be differentiated 
(Carsten 1996). When cooling from the isotropic phase to the crystalline phase, these 
LC phases are distinguished by the molecular orientational order of their constituent 46 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
molecules (Elston and Sambles 1998). The most typical LC phase is the nematic (N) 
phase, which is regarded as a high-temperature phase. The molecules lack spatial 
order but do have long-range orientational order. As a result, the thermotropic phase 
is the least organized and is, hence, the closest to an isotropic liquid; they are fluid 
enough for molecules to pass one another easily while maintaining their typical 
parallel orientations. 
Compared to nematics, smectic mesophases exhibit a higher level of order 
since the molecules are not only aligned in one direction but also further arranged 
into layers. The degree of order present inside and between layers varies between 
smectic phases, which exhibit polymorphism. These planes are the only ones where 
molecules can move. A large number of chemicals can form more than one type of 
smectic phase. However, because the intralayer interactions between the molecules 
are stronger than the interlayer forces, the layers are somewhat free to move. 
Smectics typically have higher viscosities than standard nematics because of the 
layered structure. The three most significant smectic phases are Smectic A (SmA), 
Smectic C (SmC), and Chiral Smectic C (SmC), respectively (Gray and Goodby 
1984; Khan et al. 2021). Ferroelectric LC phases are found in molecules containing 
one or more chiral centers, and chirality of the molecules is translated to the chirality 
of the macroscopic mesophase, forming a helical, chiral assembly. The generated 
helix’s pitch is temperature-dependent, and the helical structure’s handedness 
depends on the presence of a chiral center since one enantiomer produces a left￾handed helix while the other produces a right-handed helix (Takanishi 2020; Moriya 
et al. 2021). Compared to equivalent achiral phases, the symmetry is reduced when 
chirality is introduced into a mesophase. Chiral mesophases frequently exhibit steric 
effects that reduce phase stability and lower clearing points (the temperature at 
which a mesophase transitions to an isotropic phase) (Saupe 1973; Gray and Goodby 
1984; Sebastián et al. 2022). Discotic mesogens are disk-shaped, inflexible, flat, 
symmetrical, aromatic cores with an aliphatic chain perimeter. They can generate 
either columnar or nematic mesophase. Throughout the sample, the molecules in the 
discotic nematic phase freely disperse. Columnar phases, in which molecules collect 
into columns that further organize to produce various two-dimensional columnar 
assemblages, are the most frequently encountered discotic phases (Chandrasekhar 
et al. 1977; Percec et al. 2022). 
The bent-core (boomerang, bow) mesogens are another name for these 
banana-shaped LCs. These molecules are bent-core mesogens with an anisotropic 
form that differs from the classical disk and rod-shaped molecules. Examples are 
1,3-disubstituted benzene, 3,5-disubstituted 1,2,4-oxadiazoles, and 2,5-disubstituted 
1,3,4-oxadiazole. The first ferroelectric and antiferroelectric LCs without chiral 
carbon are banana-shaped LCs. When molecules have bent cores, steric packing is 
preferred because it creates layers with polar axes that are defined by molecules’ 
“bows” pointing in the same direction. This polar order is responsible for the 
macroscopic chirality of the bulk structure as well as the ferroelectric characteristics 
of the switchable B2 and B5 crystals. Mesogens in the shape of bananas display a 
wide range of liquid crystalline states; these compounds display both banana and 
typical mesophase. It was later established that it had antiferroelectric switching Oxadiazole as Liquid Crystals 47 
capabilities. These compounds often display the nematic and Bn (B1, B2, ... ) phases. 
The phases will depend on the bond angle between the center rings of the LCs; if the 
bond angle is lower, it will display nematic phases, and if the bond angle is higher, it

4. Oxadiazole as Liquid Crystals 
Synonymously called “mesogen,” liquid crystals (LCs) are of great interest to both 
research and industry because they are synthesized when the properties of two states 
of matter—solid and liquid confluent (Santos et al. 2021). They have the flexibility 
of translation between solids and liquids and orientational order, longer shelf life, 
and are thermodynamically stable (Tschierske 2013). Because of their propensity 
to align along the axis, LCs have an anisotropy property that is unique for liquids. 
The loss of orientational order is seen when a molecule has formed anisotropy and 
such molecules do not undergo a single transition from solid to liquid on heating 
but rather a series of transitions. The melting point is the first temperature at which 
a solid enters a phase known as the mesophase. A clearing temperature is when a 
solid maintains the isotropic phase (Bushby et al. 2013; Han et al. 2018). Due to 
their unique properties, they are widely recognized as organic semiconductors for 
the fabrication of efficient, ultra-lightweight, low-power-consuming, low-cost, and 
flexible components for electrical devices. As a result, new liquid crystal molecules 
are becoming increasingly popular. Adequate molecular planning is essential 
to suggest a synthetically feasible structure with the necessary properties. In this 
context, oxadiazole, the five-membered heterocycles, played a significant role in 
fabricating more durable materials with various polarities and geometries. Their ease 
of synthesis tuned physical and chemical, thermal stability, mesomorphic behavior, 
and high luminescence quantum yield are excellent LCs. This is because their unique 
structure is equipped with several mesogenic cores, including calamitic, bent cores, 
polycatenar, and discotic (Ghosh and Lehmann 2017; Kotian et al. 2020; Santos 
et al. 2021). 
It was first discovered in 1888 when Friedrich Reinitzer noticed that cholesteryl 
benzoate had two melting points in the beginning. At 145°C, the substance was turbid, 
and at 178.5°C, it turned translucent (Reinitzer 1888). Then, Otto Lehmann used a 
polarizing microscope to study cholesteryl benzoate in 1889 and concluded that it 
existed in a new state of matter at this temperature range. He then came up with the 
phrase “liquid crystal.” The term “mesomorphs,” was proposed by George Friedel. 
Rinne attempted to rename them as “Paracrystals” in 1933, and Bernal demonstrated 
in 1951 that naturally occurring LCs are connected to biological processes. Although 
their behavior is described by the names “anisotropic liquids,” “mesomorphic,” or 
“mesophases,” the term “LCs” has gained popularity (Kotian et al. 2020). 
5. Mesomorphic Features 
Oxadiazoles are five-membered heterocycles with one oxygen and two nitrogen 
atoms. They provide a wide range of biological applications, such as anticancer, 
anti-inflammatory, antimycobacterial, anticonvulsant, antibacterial, antifungal, 48 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
hypoglycemic, and antiparasitic drugs (Kotian et al. 2020). The most popular methods 
for producing 1,3,4-oxadiazole include the oxidation of acyl hydrazones (Nandeesh 
et al. 2016), thermal or acid-catalyzed cyclization of diacyl hydrazines (Patel et al. 
2014), and chloramine-T oxidative cyclization of semicarbazones (Rai et al. 1995). 
A new series of 2,2-bis (3,4,5-trialkoxyphenyl)-bi-1,3,4-oxadiazole were 
synthesized and investigated their mesomorphic behavior. The compound showed 
Col mesophases at room temperature (Qu and Li 2007). Several non-symmetrical 
1,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives’ thermal and optical characteristics were extensively 
studied, showing SmC and N phase behavior. Their mesophase ranges are broad 
with low melting points (Gallardo et al. 2020). Sung and Lin synthesized a group 
of compounds with a 1,3,4-oxadiazole moiety containing Me, OMe, Cl, F, CN, and 
NO2. Groups and investigated the properties of the liquid crystals. The derivatives 
displayed a stable SmA, SmE phase. It was observed that the mesomorphic phases, 
internal quantum efficiencies, optical characteristics, and transition temperature are 
significantly influenced by terminal substituents (Kotian et al. 2020). 
In the presence of pyridine, amidoxime and acyl chlorides can be combined 
to synthesize 1,2,4-oxadiazole (Chiou and Shine 1989). Oxadiazole-containing 
bent-shaped LCs were successfully synthesized using NO2 groups as lateral 
substituents and C’C groups as connecting groups. The transition temperature 
decreased with the addition of the terminal NO2 group, and the Sm phase was 
discovered to be present (Cristiano et al. 2005). 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives were 
synthesized using thiophene heterocycles, and their mesomorphic characteristics 
were investigated (Han et al. 2008). The derivatives with the longer alkoxy chain and 
terminal electron-withdrawing group displayed the SmA phase. They also concluded 
that terminal groups impact the formation of mesophases. Upon cyclo condensing 
amidoximes with trifluoroacetic anhydride, 3,5-disubstituted 1,2,4-oxadiazole 
compounds were synthesized (Guo et al. 2014). The chemical names displayed N 
and/or Sm phase for different derivatives. By reacting 4-benzyloxybenzonitrile with 
hydroxylamine hydrochloride, bent-shaped LCs containing 1,2,4-oxadiazole have 
been synthesized, which produced the appropriate amidoxime and further the desired 
product (Shanker and Tschierske 2011). Also, 4-[3-(4-benzyloxyphenyl)-1,2,4- 
oxadiazol-5-yl] phenyl 4-hexyl benzoate was obtained on reacting with 4-(4-n-hexyl 
benzoyl oxy) benzoic acid which showed an enantiotropic N phase. A new 
series of 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives were synthesized, and their mesomorphic 
characteristics were investigated. The synthetic materials showed the Colh phase, 
chirality, OH group, and dependency of the mesomorphic features on the aliphatic 
chain connected to the rigid disk. The Colh phase of the compound persisted even at 
ambient temperature (Girotto et al. 2014). Using TG-MS-FTIR, the thermal stability 
of LCs containing derivatives of 1,3,4-oxadiazole Schiff bases with alkyloxy and 
acyloxy terminal chains was investigated. The compounds had good thermal stability 
and could tolerate temperatures up to 330 °C. When compared to acyloxy analogs, 
it was discovered that compounds with the alkoxy terminal chain had improved 
thermal stability (Lisa et al. 2011). 
Star-shaped 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives with alkoxy substitutions were 
synthesized in conjunction with phenyl ethynylenes. Enantiotropic Col mesophase Oxadiazole as Liquid Crystals 49 
was present in the discotic molecules that were produced. The compound with a 
C12 alkyl chain changes into a glassy film with LC characteristics that remained 
stable for over a year. It is also thought to be a strong contender for displays and 
non-doped blue-emitting diodes (Prabhu et al. 2012). Phenylene bis-1,3,4-oxadiazole 
group-containing LCs were synthesized, which showed the characteristics of typical 
LCs (Chai et al. 2008). Ten novel 1,2,4-oxadiazole bent-rod-shaped compounds 
were synthesized with polar substituents like nitrogen dioxide (NO2), hydroxy 
(OH), amino (NH2), and iodine (I) on the central core exhibited LC characteristics. 
Compounds substituted with NO2, and I lacked mesomorphic properties. Despite 
having a bent form, compounds showed the Colh phase. It might be due to the 
hydrogen bonding, steric interactions, and dipoles that result in the dimer, trimer, 
and tetramer inside a single disk and enable the formation of a Colh phase (Kotian 
et al. 2020). The 1,3,4-oxadiazole compound, containing gallic acid, was 
synthesized to study their liquid crystalline characteristics. The compound showed a 
crystal-to-isotropic transition and exhibited monotropic Colh, which made it evident 
that the terminal alkyl chain influences how the LC behaves. It was claimed that the 
produced compounds have improved thermal stability, which makes them suitable 
materials for organic electronics (Frizon et al. 2014). 
In order to study the behavior of 2,5-disubstituted [1,3,4]-oxadiazole in 
polycatenars 2,5-bis4-[(E)-2-(3,4-diakoxyphenyl) vinyl] phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles 
were synthesized. Tetracatenar oxadiazoles, dicatenar oxadiazoles, and hexacatenar 
oxadiazoles all showed lamellar phase, whereas the dicatenar oxadiazoles showed 
only Col phase. Two phenylenevinylene groups in the tetracatenar caused lamellar 
phases. As the number of chains increased from dicatenars to tetracatenars to 
hexacatenars, a drop in the transition temperature was seen (He et al. 2007). Several 
nonsymmetric compounds with 1,3,4-oxadiazole and biphenyl units and various 
terminal chains were synthetically produced. The derivatives showed either N or 
SmA mesophase. It was discovered that the mesophases were caused by the electrical 
characteristics of terminal groups, such as UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence 
(Han et al. 2010). Boomerang-shaped LCs containing 2,5-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)­
1,3,4-oxadiazole showed LC characteristics. P-Dodecyloxyphenyl tails were used 
to replace the mesogenic core, and the outcome was polymorphism with five 
SKDVHV16P&6P;6P<DQG6P= 'LQJHPDQVDQG6DPXOVNL%DUEHUá 
and colleagues synthesized and studied a unique series of LC materials based on 
1,3,5-benzenetrisamide trioxadiazole derivatives with varied side alkoxy chains. 
They have documented how mesophases depend on various terminal alkoxy chains. 
Nine alkoxy chains were reported to exhibit the Col phase, while compounds with 
six alkoxy chains displayed the Colh phase (Barberá et al. 2011). 
By treating 3-(4-pyridyl)-5-(4-n-alkoxy) phenyl-1,2,4-oxadiazoles with benzoic 
acid, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, or 4-methylbenzoic acid, the LCs were created. It was 
noticed that oxadiazole or carboxylic acid did not exhibit any mesomorphic features. 
But LC behavior was visible when they were joined together through H-bonding 
(Parra et al. 2005). Lin and co-workers synthesized a new set of mesogens carrying 
1,3,4-oxadiazole and thiophene and displayed the Colh phase (Lin et al. 2015). Tomi 
and co-workers synthesized and characterized two series of ester compounds based 50 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
on the two isomers of the oxadiazole ring. On cooling in a specific range, some 
derivatives of the 1,2,4-oxadiazole isomer showed monotropic N mesomorphism. 
The 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives that were synthesized, however, were discovered 
to be non-mesomorphic. They concluded that the bending angles of the oxadiazole 
derivatives substantially influence mesomorphic characteristics (Tomi et al. 
2017). Another study investigated the impact of the terminal alkoxy chains in the 
1,2,4-oxadiazole core, which had both ester and ether linkages inside the same 
molecule. They concluded that the length of the terminal alkoxy chain did not affect 
the character of mesophase (Ali et al. 2017). 
Kang and co-workers synthesized bent-shaped molecules with varied side 
chains. Polymorphism was discovered in oxadiazole derivatives, including calamitic 
N and SmC phases and the banana Bx phase (Kang et al. 2006). In another study, a 
series of polycatenar-based LCs containing bis-1,3,4-oxadiazole were investigated 
to study their liquid crystalline characteristics, which exhibit the Colh phase (Kotian 
et al. 2020). Based on oxadiazole bis aniline, the synthesis of bent-core LC molecules 
was reported, and their phase behaviors were investigated. Three distinct alkyl chains 
were used to create three different molecules. Compounds that have terminal hexyl 
and terminal octyl chains only display N phases, whereas compounds with terminal 
dodecyl alkyl chains only display SmC, SmX, and SmY phases, respectively (Kotian 
et al. 2020). 
Saha et al. (2017) created the asymmetrical hockey stick-shaped mesogenic 
molecules with 1,3,4-oxadiazole as the central core component and a lateral methoxy 
group. The monotropic N phase was present in compounds with shorter alkyl chains, 
but the SmA phase was present in the extended derivative. Abboud et al. (2017) 
explored a similar series with the terminal nitro group and the mesogenic core 
1,3,4-oxadiazole. While compounds with longer-terminal alkoxy chains displayed 
the SmA phase, those with shorter-terminal alkyl chains displayed the N phase. 
Al-Obaidy et al. (2017) investigated several 1,3,4 and 1,2,4 oxadiazole derivatives 
with various para-substitutions (CN, COOCH3, OCH3, NO2, Cl). They discovered 
that several groups contributed to the molecule’s mesogenity in various ways. 
SmA, N, and SmC phases could be seen in every derivative that was produced. The 
mesomorphic properties of 1,3,4- and 1,2,4-oxadiazoles were also studied, and it was 
discovered that 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives lack LC features. 
The impact of lateral halogen substitutions in bent-core LCs with oxadiazole 
rings was described by Nguyen et al. (2015). When the compounds with one halogen 
and two methyl groups reached room temperature, they displayed the N phase. 
When halogens were substituted, the N phase persisted and changed to the isotropic 
phase upon further heating. The synthesis and mesomorphic behavior of tris- and 
bis-(1,3,4-oxadiazoles) with peripheral quinoxalines were reported by Lin and Lai 
(2016). The compounds exhibited phase crossover in the temperature range between 
the rectangular and hexagonal Col phases, which displayed Colr at low temperatures 
and Colh at high temperatures. They explained it away as being caused by the 
hefty quinoxaline necklace. A new series of 4-[5-(p-tolyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl] 
phenyl substituted benzoate derivatives were synthesized by Ali and co-workers 
and investigated the impact of terminal substituents on LC characteristics (Ali Oxadiazole as Liquid Crystals 51 
et al. 2019). The para-substituted compounds displayed an enantiotropic N phase 
over a broad temperature range. In order to study their potential use as dopants 
in blue phases (BPs), Yu et al. (2019) developed bent-shaped light-responsive 
azo-oxadiazole derivatives. When compared to straight terminals, they discovered 
that synthetic derivatives with branching terminals had greater miscibility in the 
host LC. They also looked at how the rigid core’s length affected the BP range and 
discovered that as it got longer, the rigid core’s temperature range likewise grew. 
The 1,2,4-oxadiazole linked to thiophene was synthesized by Girotto et al. (2016) 
and showed mesomorphic behavior. They noticed that the increase in the number 
of chains on the symmetrical and non-symmetrical compounds did not favor the 
mesomorphic behavior, most likely due to the rise in volume. Mesomorphism in 
the N phase was also seen in compounds when triple bonds were used as spacers 
instead of the 1,3,4-oxadiazole in combination. This compound produced a more 
ordered SmC phase and N phase, and a lower melting temperature was also noted. 
Furthermore, 1,3,4-oxadiazoles derivatives were synthesized by Kuo et al. (2016), 
who also studied their mesomorphic behavior. The limited mesophase temperature 
range and higher clearing temperatures were present in all the synthetically produced 
derivatives’ N or/and Sm phases. In one of their schemes, Choi et al. (2011) reported 
synthesizing a new series of 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives and investigated their LC 
characteristics. They also detailed the synthesis of 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives with 
lollipop shapes. Derivatives that combined rod- and disk-shaped mesogen produced 
monotropic discotic Col mesophase. 
Oxadiazoles are one of the most widely used heterocycles in LCs among the 
five-membered heterocycles. Due to the simplicity of synthesis, there are 
numerous papers on the synthesis and mesomorphic investigations of 1,3,4- and 
1,2,4-oxadiazoles. When mesomorphic studies are considered, it is discovered that 
1,2,4-oxadiazoles exhibit better mesomorphic features, indicating the importance of 
the bending angle. When joined to substituted phenyl rings and another five-membered 
heterocyclic ring, 1,3,4-oxadiazole rings display mesomorphism. Mesophase types 
include banana mesophases, discotic or Col mesophases, and traditional calamitic 
mesophases (N, SmA, and SmC). 
6. Conclusion 
The applications of LCs, which are intriguing materials, are used in a variety of 
scientific fields, including physics, chemistry, arithmetic, biology, and technology. 
They are frequently used in the fabrication of devices for various applications. Due 
to its asymmetric electron cloud distribution, the 1,2,4-oxadiazole is a promising 
core to display “B” phases. The 1,2,3, 1,2,4, 1,2,5, and 1,3,4-oxadiazoles exhibit 
remarkable biological and physiological properties. The oxadiazole derivatives 
have also been noted to be effective OLEDs, photovoltaic, and EL devices. It has 
been widely acknowledged that there has been a significant advancement in the 
structure-property connections of liquid crystalline 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives. The 
1,3,4-oxadiazole unit, one of the most significant synthons, has been extensively 
employed to create numerous LCs with different mesophases, such as uniaxial 
nematic, smectic, columnar phases and even the elusive nematic phase with 52 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
biaxiality. But there are still a lot of scientific questions in this area that require 
inquiry, and research needs thorough investigations. Last but not least, even though 
numerous liquid crystalline 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives have been developed, most 
of them are used for theoretical and basic research. Future research into the practical 
application of novel materials must be considerably expanded.

Oxadiazole as 
Electrochromic Materials 
1. Introduction 
When the oxidation states of electrochromic materials are changed by applying 
an electrochemical input, the color change occurs reversibly. The phenomenon of 
electrochromism was first reported by Deb using WO3 (Deb 1969; Deb 1973). In 
recent years, these materials have attracted much attention for various applications, 
including smart windows, electrochromic displays, and optical switches (Mortimer 
1997; Irie et al. 2014; Seeboth et al. 2014). Materials based on conjugated polymers 
like poly(3-alkylthiophene) and poly(3,4-alkylenedioxythiophene) derivatives 
(Beaujuge and Reynolds 2010; Akpinar et al. 2013; Tang et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 
2016; Brooke et al. 2017), transition metal oxides (Dyer and Leach 1978; Niklasson 
and Granqvist 2007; Jin et al. 2009), metal complexes (Joseph et al. 1991; Talagaeva 
et al. 2016; Yan et al. 2016) and organic dyes (Argazzi et al. 2004; Palenzuela 
et al. 2014) have displayed tremendous potential as electrochemical materials due to 
intense coloration. However, compared to materials with a colorless neutral state, the 
sharpness of color transition is substantially lower (Mortimer 1999; Rosseinsky and 
Mortimer 2001). Recently, electrochromic materials based on poly(3-alkylthiophene) 
and poly(3,4-alkylenedioxythiopene) derivatives have been reported, which can 
be employed as flexible electrochromic devices (Mortimer 1999; Rosseinsky 
and Mortimer 2001) with advantages like low operation voltage, short switching 
time, good coloration with high modification flexibility in tuning the color (Chang 
et al. 2008; Oßwald et al. 2017). Recently, a copolymer of oxadiazole and 
oligo(9,9-dicoctylfuorene) has been reported to show a very sharp color change 
compared to other electrochromic materials (Ding et al. 2002). Therefore, this 
chapter is focused on electrochromic materials based on oxadiazole. 
2. Mechanism of Electrochromism 
Electrochromic materials, in response to an electrical stimulus, undergo reversible 
changes in color or fluorescence signal due to their oxidation and reduction due 
to a change in the band gap. The change in band gap causes changes in the optical Conducting electrode

signal (colorimetric or fluorescence). However, continuous electrical input is 
usually desired to sustain a change in color (or fluorescence). Due to the memory 
effect, the phenomena require almost negligible to nil current consumption in some 
electrochromic materials. The electrolyte and electrodes are placed in close contact 
with the electrochromic material to allow the flow of current in a practical device 
having a thin film of electrochromic material. The thin film of electrochromic 
material adopts a multilayer structure that enables the tailoring of properties of 
the device through the application of optical properties through the application 
of voltage. Alteration of the polarity of voltage leads to reversal of color change. 
Practical electrochromic devices usually consist of superimposed layers, such as 
the transparent conducting oxide layer, ion storage layer, ion conducting layer, 
electrochromic layer, and the transparent conducting layer (Figure 1). The design has 
an electrochromic layer coated on one side and an ion storage layer on the other side of 
the conductor. The ion storage primarily drives charge transport from a power source 
to the electrochromic material layer (Invernale et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2016; Patel 
et al. 2017). 
The function of an ion conductor, which consists of ionic charge carriers, ensures 
the circuit completion and facilitates ion transport between electrodes (Marcilla 
et al. 2006; Thakur et al. 2012; Assis et al. 2015; Moser et al. 2016). The sealant 
ensures that no electrolyte is leaked when the device functions (Byker 2001; Eh 
et al. 2018). Transport of H+
 and Li+
 in the devices consisting of a glass of polyester 
substrate causes an alteration in optical output. Some variations have been 
observed in laminated devices. For example, the devices dependent on H+
 transport 
utilize a copolymer of sodium vinylsulfonic acid, 1-vinyl-2-pyrrolidnone, and 
poly-2-acrylamindo-2-methyl-propane sulfonic acid along with polyethylene oxide 
(PEO) as electrolyte (Jelle et al. 1993; Ho 1999; Jelle and Hagen 1999; Chen and 
Ho 2001). Laminated devices are dependent on Li+
 transport, like those consisting 
of PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) with polypyrrole (Ericson et al. 2000; Jang 
et al. 2001; Jang and Oh 2005), polypropylene (Mishra et al. 2005; Nunes et al. 58 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
2008), silane (Luo et al. 2008; Puguan et al. 2016), polyvinyl fluoride (Wang 
et al. 2000; Avellaneda et al. 2002; Barbosa et al. 2010; Jia et al. 2011), propylene 
carbonate (Bohnke et al. 1982; Zhou et al. 2013; Wen et al. 2014), copolymer of 
polyethylene glycol methyacrylate with PEO (Munro et al. 1998; Barbosa et al. 
2010) and/or glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilate with tetraethylene glycol (Munro 
et al. 1998; Möller et al. 2004) for color modulation function after addition of 
optimum level of Li salt. 
3. Advantages of Oxadiazole as Electrochromic Materials 
A variety of materials, like organic polymers, inorganic oxide, or copolymers of 
hybrid materials, have been used as electrochromic materials (Hedrick and Twieg 
1992). Among them as heterocyclic components, the introduction of segments like 
oxadiazoles impart unique advantages to the materials, which include their high 
thermal stability, high luminescence quantum yield in the visible region, convenient 
introduction, processability into materials and robustness of film or thin layers (Hwang 
and Chen 2002). It is pertinent to mention here that some oxadiazole derivatives are 
also difficult to process, leading to their decomposition and low solubility in the 
solvent. The limitations can be overcome by substituting oxadiazole-based materials 
and their precursors via simple chemical reactions (Liou et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2005; 
Yen and Liou 2009; Kung and Hsiao 2011). The introduction of bulky triaryl amine 
substituents usually results in an amorphous polymer with excellent processability 
and solubility in organic solvents. Oxadiazole derivatives are also employed as 
efficient electron transporting segments conjugated polymers in one of the bilayer 
systems (Yen and Liou 2009). 
In the following sections, a variety of electrochemical materials with oxadiazole 
segments have been discussed: 
• Oxadiazole in Combination With Polythiophene 
• Oxadiazole in Combination With TTF Derivatives 
• Oxadiazole in Combination With Carbazoles 
• Oxadiazole in Combination With Organic Amines 
• Oxadiazole in Combination With Fluorene 
3.1 Oxadiazole in Combination With Polythiophene 
Conducting polymers like polyacetylene has been the focus of attention due to easy 
alteration in their band gap, processibility, structure modification, flexibility, and 
cost-effectiveness (Dyer et al. 2010; Hacioglu et al. 2014). However, its insolubility, 
instability in air, and high conductivity prevent its application in the electronic 
industry, which led to search for conjugated polymers with more stability for utility 
in applications like organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), organic field effect 
transistors, solar cells, biosensors and electrochromic devices (McQuade et al. 2000; 
Bolduc et al. 2010; Kamtekar et al. 2010; Li et al. 2010; Mondal et al. 2010; Seo 
et al. 2011; Ameri et al. 2013). The band gap in conjugated polymers determines their 
color, conductivity, and optoelectronic properties. These properties can be tubed by Oxadiazole as Electrochromic Materials 59 
planarity, resonance, and bond length alteration along the polymer chain and through 
interchain donor-acceptor properties (Bouffard and Swager 2008). The past few 
years have seen the use of benzotriazole, benzothiadiazole, benzoquinolisalines, 
cayanovinylenes, benzimidazoles, thienopyrazines, perylenes, benzotriazoles, etc., 
as acceptor unit for turning the band gap in D-A type polymers (Blanchard et al. 
2001; Thomas et al. 2004; Aldakov et al. 2005; Durmus et al. 2007; Balan et al. 2008; 
Gunbas et al. 2008; Balan et al. 2009; Çetin et al. 2009; Karsten et al. 2009; Kozma 
et al. 2010; Ozelcaglayan et al. 2012; Zaifoglu et al. 2012). Benzooxadiazole is known 
to be a strong electron acceptor compared to benzotriazole and benzothiadiazole 
owing to the higher electronegativity of the oxygen atom. Benzooxadiazole utility 
is further enhanced by coplanarity of its structure, ability to form quinoid structure, 
air stability, and appropriate band gap. Therefore, it was investigated as an efficient 
aromatic acceptor moiety in D-A type polymers (Ding et al. 2011; Jiang et al. 2011; 
Özkut et al. 2012; Jiang et al. 2013). It has also been reported in the literature that 
the presence of substituents at positions 5 and 6 of benzo oxadiazole provides a 
polymer with better solubility in common solvents, while the introduction of alkyl 
chains on the benzo oxadiazole ring yields polymers of high molecular weights and 
planar conformation (Ding et al. 2011; Jiang et al. 2011; Özkut et al. 2012; Jiang 
et al. 2013). In a similar context, the presence of a thiophene unit in the material 
is known to impart a strong and broad absorption band, ensure appropriate energy 
levels for efficient charge transfer properties, and provide higher stability polymer 
with high contrast and fast switching time, which makes them appropriate for 
use in electrochromic devices (Kumar et al. 1998; Balan et al. 2011). Therefore, 
conjugation of electron-rich donor thiophene in a D-A type structure yields a 
red-shifted absorption band and enables electrochemical polymerization owing to 
its low oxidation potential (Sotzing et al. 1996; Irvin and Reynolds 1998). Given 
this, Özkut et al. have synthesized three D-A polymers based on POP-C10, EOE, 
and TOT monomers and investigated their electrochromic properties (Özkut et al. 
2012). The color produced by polyelectrochomes has been reported to be developed 
efficiently using the donor-acceptor-donor approach (Havinga et al. 1992). 
The three monomers consist of benzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole as the acceptor 
unit and 3,3-didecyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-thieno[3,4-b]]1,4]-dioxepine,3,4­
ethylenedioxythiphene or thiophene as the donor unit. The corresponding polymers 
P(POP-C10), P(EOE), and P(TOT) were investigated for optical and electrochemical 
output. The electrochemical properties of the monomeric form of EOE and TOT 
were analyzed in acetonitrile using tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as 
the electrolyte, while POP-C10 dichloromethane was used to observe irreversible 
oxidation peaks at 1.09 (POP-C10), 1.01 (EOE), 1.35 V (TOT) (Table 1). As

expected for the D-A-D systems, the energy of HOMO level changes with a change 
in the donor, while not much change in the energy of LUMO is expected in such 
situations. So, since the acceptor unit (oxadiazole) is the same in each monomer, 
it is expected that reduction peak potential values shown by the three monomers 
should be similar, while energies of LUMO levels should alter due to change in 
donor unit as observed for TOT. It should be noted that cathodic peak potential 
values are lower than expected. The results observed for EOE, POP-C10, and TOT 
follow expected trends for such systems (Kaya et al. 2011). The monomers were 
electrochemically polymerized under conditions similar to those used for cyclic 
voltammetry to witness a new reversible redox couple, indicating the formation of 
conducting film on the surface of the electrode. Moreover, an increase in current at the 
redox couple suggested the formation of electroactive polymers on the surface of the 
working electrode, which increased in thickness with an increased number of cycles 
(Figure 2). 
The polymer films were studied using cyclic voltammetry. No n-doping 
properties on adding selenadiazole, thiadiazole, and triazole to P(POP-C10) 
polymer was witnessed previously, perhaps due to steric effect caused by long alkyl 
groups in polymer chains (Havinga et al. 1992; øoOLHWDO. However, polymer 
P(POP-C10) displayed a peak at –1.5 V during the cathodic scan, indicating the 
polymer can be p-doped, as shown in Figure 2(d), which may be attributed to the 
presence of heteroatoms in these monomers. The benzo[c][1,2,5]oxadiazole having 
electronegative heteroatom was observed to be the most effective acceptor. For 
polymers and monomers, similar behavior was observed during the oxidation scan 
due to its dependence on the electron density of the donor moiety [Figure 2(d)]. 
UV-vis spectral profile for P(POP-C10) revealed absorption bands at 400 nm 
and 697 nm, P(EOE) revealed absorption bands at 420 nm and 775 nm, while for 
P(TOT) absorption bands at 345 nm and 560 nm were witnessed. On oxidation, a 
diminishing effect on the absorbance values of these absorption bands was observed, 
and the effect was greater on P(EOE) and P(TOT) as compared to P(POP-C10). 
During oxidation, a new absorption band appeared at 900 nm, P(POP-C10), 1,000 
nm, P(EOE), and 750 nm (P(TOT), indicating the generation of charge carriers. For 
P(POP-C10), P(EOE) and P(TOT) optical band gaps were estimated as 1.40, 1.27, 
and 1.48 eV, respectively, using UV-vis spectroscopic data, which was observed to 
agree with the electrochemical data (Table 1). The neutral state of polymer P(EOE) 
displayed a greenish-blue color, P(POP-C10) displayed cyan, while a magenta color 
was displayed by P(TOT). After n-doping, P(EOE) displayed a light brown color, 
P(POP-C10) displayed a brown color, while a dark gray color was displayed by Oxadiazole as Electrochromic Materials 61

P(TOT) (Table 2). Moreover, a change in color from greenish-blue region to magenta 
can be accomplished by changing the donor units. Further, using color mixing theory, 
it was demonstrated that all colors in the visible region of the spectrum may be 
obtained using these polymers as they exhibit both p- and n-type doping properties, 
making them excellent candidates for incorporation into electrochromic devices. In 
addition, the polymer bearing propyledioxythiohene donor units displayed superior 
properties like high stability, electroactivity even after 2,000 cycles, solubility, high 
coloration efficiency, and lowest band gap at 1.08 eV. 
Given this, Göker et al. have synthesized 3 D-A polymers (PBODT, PBOHT, and 
PBODHT) containing benzooxadiazole units through electrochemical polymerization 
and investigated their electrochromic properties (Scheme 1) (Göker et al. 2014). The 
electropolymerization of the monomers, namely BODT, BOHT, and PBODHT, was 
performed in CH2Cl2/MeCN (5/95, v/v) using 0.1 M sodium perchlorate/lithium 
perchlorate as supporting electrolyte and observed an enhancement in current density 
at anode and cathode suggesting deposition of polymer film on working electrode 
surface (1.25 V/0.93 V for PBODT, 1.23 V/0.88 V for PBOHT and 0.95/–0.49 V 
for PBODHT; Figure 3). The presence of electron-rich 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene 
(EDOT) moiety in PBODHT polymer film reduced redox potential output compared 
to PBOT and PBOHT polymer. The cyclic voltammetric data was used to obtain 
energies of HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels

were estimated at –5.73 eV and –6.98 eV for PBODT. In the case of PBOHT, 5.54 eV 
energy was estimated for the HOMO orbital, while –5.54 eV energy was estimated 
for the LUMO orbital. Similarly, –4.43 eV and –6.23 eV energies were estimated for 
HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBODHT, respectively. 
Spectro-electrochemistry experiments on examination revealed optical and 
electronic changes like band gap, intergap states, absorption maxima, and formation 
of polaronic and bipolarnic bands upon doping. The formation of polarons and 
bipolarons was investigated by acquiring UV-vis-NIR spectra as a function of 
applied potential. The formation of lower energy carriers occurs due to absorbance 
enhancement in the UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymer films. The potential 
was scanned in 0.0 to 1.2 V region for PBODT polymer, 0.0 V to 1.15 V for 
PBOHT, and –1.20 V to 0.8 V for PBODHT during polymerization on ITO glass 
slide, which eliminates the possibility of dopant ions and charges formed during the 
electropolymerization of monomers. The polymers were initially reduced to neutral 
states, followed by oxidation during spectroelectrochemistry studies. The studies 
revealed absorption maxima for PBODT at 551 nm, for PBOHT at 577 nm, and 
for PBODHT at 590 nm, which were used to estimate band gaps as 1.25, 1.27, and 
1.50 eV for polymers PBODT, PBOHT, and PBODHT, respectively (Figure 4). The 
difference in band gap was attributed to steric interactions of alkyl chains at the third 
position of the thiophene unit, which distorted the planarity of the polymer main 
chain in these polymers, resulting in reduced overlap between ʌ-orbitals. However, 
bipolarons and polarons bands were not resolved, perhaps due to bipolarons not 
forming through oxidation of polarons but due to polarons coupling. 
Due to the utility of electrochromism in many commercial applications like 
displays, windows, mirrors, and sunglasses, p-doping/dedoping studies were 
performed. The polymer possessing thiophene switched between purple and blue 
colors, the polymer with 3-hexylthiophene switched between blue and pale green 
colors, and the polymer possessing EDOT switched between dark blue and pale blue.

The optical values of PBODHT were witnessed between PBODT and PBOHT 
with 75% transmittance change at 590 nm, while 88% transmittance change at 1,500 
nm was observed in the visible region. Moreover, EDOT and thiophene-containing 
polymers display a rapid switching between their neutral and oxidized states. The 
polymer PBODT displays switching times of 1.1 s at 555 nm and 0.5 s at 1,300 nm. 
The polymer PBOHT displayed a switching time of 2.5 s at 580 nm and 1.5 s at 
1,290 nm, while PBOHT displayed a switching time of 0.9 s at 590 nm and 1.1 s at 
1,500 nm. Therefore, it can be seen from the data that the polymer PBODHT displays Oxadiazole as Electrochromic Materials 65

the fastest switching times and highest contrast among the three polymers used in 
the study. The study suggested that three polymers are p-dopable and display high 
contrast in the NIR region. Moreover, using the EDOT unit as an electron-rich EDOT 
unit as a donor unit with oxadiazole as an acceptor unit exerts a stronger influence on 
the electronic properties of the polymers, leading to a red shift in the absorption and 
a decrease in oxidation potential. 
3.2 Oxadiazole in Combination With TTF Derivatives 
Tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) derivatives are known for their reversible electrochemical 
oxidation and exceptional thermodynamic stability of radical cations and dicationic 
form stability (Bryce 1991). Moreover, their low oxidation potential (TTF, 
E1 
, = 0.32 V vs. Ag/AgCl) imparts them with properties like low power 1/2
consumption and low driving voltage, making them attractive for their use in 
electrochromic devices. Given this discussion, Wang et al. have synthesized 
three TTF derivatives conjugated to 1,3.4-oxadiazole units were synthesized 
(TTFOX1-TTFOX3) and demonstrated the potential of such materials as 
electrochromic devices (Wang et al. 2004). Cyclic voltammograms of the 
oxadiazole-TTF combinations (TTFOX1-TTFOX3) were acquired in DCM using 
0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as a supporting 
electrolyte. The TTFOX1-TTFOX3 combinations displayed reversible TTF type 
two-step, one-electron redox couples in 0 to 1 V region (vs. Ag/AgCl). A comparison 
of the half-wave potentials of TTFOX1 (E1
,1/2 = 0.12 and E2
,1/2 = 0.63 V) and TTFOX2 
(E1
,1/2 = 0.16 and E2
,1/2 = 0.64 V) with TTF1 (Bryce 2000; Segura and Martín 
2001) suggested a 100 mV anodic shift in the half-wave potential owing to electron 
acceptor properties of oxadiazole derivative. Moreover, the presence of ethynylene 
segment in TTFOX2 led to a small variation in electrochemical signal as compared 
to TTFOX1. The presence of an additional oxadiazole unit and absence of methyl 
groups (electron donating) led to the highest shift in anodic potential in TTFOX3 
(E1
,1,2 = 0.31 V and E2
,1/2 = 0.74 V) as compared to TTF1. The electrochromic 
properties of TTFOX1-TTFOX3 were investigated using spectroelectrochemistry, 
and absorption maxima of the oxidized and neutral forms are listed in Table 4.

The UV-vis spectra of TTFOX3 in DCM using 0.1 M TBAPF6 were recorded as a 
function of applied voltage (vs. Pt electrode) (Figure 5). The neutral form of TTFOX3 
displayed an absorption band at 447 nm, while the radical cationic form TTFOX3+ 
formed through oxidation displayed two new absorption bands at 435 nm and 
722 nm. On increasing the voltage, the two absorption bands gradually decreased in 
intensity, and a new absorption band at 585 nm appeared, indicating the formation 
of dicationic form TTFOX32+
. A comparison of absorption bands in TTFOX3 and 
TTF (Wudl et al. 1970; Hünig et al. 1973; Bryce 1991) disclosed a large red shift 
in the absorption maxima of the dicationic form (ǻ 230 nm) as compared to the 
radical cationic form (ǻ 140 nm), indicating extended conjugation in dicationic 
form of TTFOX3. Similar optoelectrochemical properties were observed in three 
TTFOX1-TTFOX3 derivatives. For instance, the neutral form of TTFOX1 displayed

holes in optoelectronic devices (Rani and Santhanam 1998; Tao et al. 1998). 
Polymers that consist of hole-transporting (acceptor) units are of great interest due 
to the possibility of increasing both hole and electron transport affinities in such 
materials. The properties of materials possessing a carbazole moiety can be easily 
fine-tuned through functionalization at nitrogen, 3,6, and 2,7 positions. Incorporating 
oxadiazole units as an electron-deficient acceptor unit into a polymer chain stabilizes 
the electron-charged state of electrochromic materials. Incorporating oxadiazole 
units in polymeric electrochromic materials also thermally stabilizes them and 
prolongs their application in electrochromic devices. 
Given the above discussion, Udum et al. have reported a 2,5-bis(9-methyl-9H￾carbazol-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (CZOX), which was electrochemically oxidized to 
poly(2,5-Bis(9-methyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole) yielding stable films 
with electrochromic properties (Udum et al. 2015). Spectroelectrochemical analysis 
was performed, which demonstrated the feasibility of both the p-type and n-type 
doping processes. The n-dopable properties were demonstrated by polymer through 
the presence of redox response at negative potential. The thin films of P(CZOX) 
were potentiodynamically deposited on ITO using a solution of 0.01 M CZOX and 
tetrabutylammonium fluoroborate in acetonitrile (Scheme 2). Incrementally raising 
the potential between 0 to 1.5 V led to no sharp absorption peak in the visible range at Oxadiazole as Electrochromic Materials 69

the neutral state in Figure 7. Further increase in potential value led to the appearance 
of a new absorption band near 660 nm, imparting a blue color to the polymer film. 
The electrochromic device constructed based on P(CZOX) operated between 
transmissive gray and blue colored states on the application of a potential between 
–1.6 V and +1.6 V. The kinetic studies performed with polymer demonstrated a high 
contrast ratio (75%), excellent stability, color persistence, and fast response time. 
Wu et al. have reported carbazole derivatives (COP) having (trifluoromethyl) 
pyridine and COI having isoxazole conjugated to oxadiazole unit to investigate 
the electrochromic properties of their oxidized polymeric films (Wu et al. 2023). 
Cyclic voltammetric studies of both COP and COI (2 mM) in 0.1 M LiClO4 
solution indicated Eonset as 1.38 and 1.25 V (Vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. The 
isoxazole ring having an imine as an electron-withdrawing group represents a weak 
electron-donating unit, while the 3-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine unit is an 
electron-withdrawing unit in COP. Therefore, the Eonset of COP was observed to be 
higher than COI. Moreover, a continuation of the CV sweep led to an enhancement in 
the intensity of redox peaks and the development of electrochemically active P(COP) 
and P(COI) films on the surface of the ITO working electrode (Scheme 3). The 
thermal properties of electrosynthesized films of P(COP) and P(COI) were studied 
using thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis under a nitrogen atmosphere to observe a 
5% decomposition at 249°C and 239°C and a char yield of 28% and 44% at 800°C, 
respectively. 
The UV-vis-NIR spectra of P(COP) and P(COI) electrodes in solution are shown 
in Figure 8(a, b). At a low value of applied potential, no absorption peak is visible 
in the visible region (> 400 nm). On application of an applied potential of 0.8 V, the 
oxidation of P(COP) started, leading to the appearance of polarons and bipolarons 
absorption bands at 423 nm, 710 nm, and 1,100 nm (Kuo et al. 2022). Similar to their 
corresponding polymers, the monomers COP and COI did not display an absorption 
band beyond 400 nm. The P(COP) film displayed yellow ocher, grayish green, and F3C F3C

of polymers changes further upon a change in the doped state. The electrochromic 
switching kinetics P(COP) and P(COI) between potential values of 0.0 and 1.4 V 
in solution at an interval of 5 s is shown in Figure 9. The change in transmittance 
value for P(COP) was 27.5% at 710 nm and 40.1% at 1,100 nm, respectively, while 
for P(COI), the transmittance value at 28.2% at 743 nm and 34.0% at 1,200 nm, 
respectively were observed. The polycarbazoles containing oxadiazole-based ECDs 
demonstrated high electrochemical redox stability, short bleaching, and coloring 
time in the study. The authors concluded that polycabazoles, in combination with 
oxadiazole, are promising electrochemical materials for use in multicolored and 
energy-saving electrochromic devices.

materials (Lin et al. 2007; Liou et al. 2007). The bulkiness of propeller-shaped

advantages associated with its coupling to oxadiazole segments, Yen and Liou have 
synthesized poly(amine-hydrazide) and poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole) derivatives 
(Yen and Liou 2009). In the study, polymers 1–VI were prepared. The polymers 
having hydrazides were thermally converted into poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s 
with IPH and TPH spacer units. 
The glass transition temperatures of (Tg) of poly(amino-hydrazide)s 
and poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s were reported using differential thermal 
calorimetry (DSC) to be in the range 200–221°C and 297–318°C, respectively. 
The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) suggested no significant weight loss for all 
poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s, indicating their stability. A significant char yield 
for polymer at around 55% was observed for high aromatic content. The optical 
properties of poly(amine-hydrazide)s and poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole) were 
reported using UV-vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy. 
They displayed good solubility and absorption bands in the 344–391 nm region 
in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), which may be assigned to ʌWRʌ* transition due 
to the aromatic chromophore. The photoluminescence spectra displayed bands in the Oxadiazole as Electrochromic Materials 73

On comparison of the peak potential of IV-TPH with I-TPH, it can be concluded 
that the second reduction in IV-TPH occurs in the anthracene group, while the third 
reduction occurs in the oxadiazole moieties. Moreover, the first and second reduction 
stages in IV-IPH can also be assigned to the anthracene and oxadiazole segments, 
respectively. The energies of HOMO and LUMO orbitals calculated from the onset 
of oxidation and reduction potentials along with the onset of absorption wavelength 
are listed in Table 5. 
The study concluded that introducing a bulky anthracene group into the 
polymer chain increases interchain interactions and disrupts coplanarity, thereby 
enhancing the solubility of the polymer. The resulting amorphous polymer 
displayed high optical transparency during UV-vis transmittance measurements in 
a cutoff wavelength of 415–435 nm region. The poly(amine-hydrazide) I-IPH and 
poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole) IV-IPH exhibited green fluorescence with a 
maximum near 490 nm in NMP with high quantum yield (29.9% and 13.5%). The 
anthracene-based poly(amine-1,3,4-oxadiazole)s displayed electrochromic 74 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry

it was demonstrated that anthrylamine-based polymers have great potential as 
electrochromic material with high thermal stability, solubility, quantum efficiency 
and electrochemical behavior. 
3.5 Oxadiazole in Combination With Fluorene 
The emission of blue light is normally associated with high energy gaps and requires 
the application of high electric field intensities to the layers emitting light. Therefore, 
there is a demand for blue light-emitting polymers with high oxidative and thermal 
stabilities. In this context, fluorene-based polymers represent interesting blue Oxadiazole as Electrochromic Materials 75 
light-emitting materials that have high chemical stability and allow easy structural 
tuning to achieve the desired results. A variety of polymers based on fluorene 
copolymerized with other monomers have been reported with good photoluminescence 
efficiency and high thermal and oxidative stability. Moreover, functionalization at 
the 9-position also offers control of interchain interactions, cross-linking ability, 
and electrical and optical properties. A highly efficient electrochromic material 
may be obtained using a balance of holes and electrons in the polymer emissive 
layer. Given this, Ding et al. have reported an alternative copolymer of fluorene 
and oxadiazole and reported its electrochromic properties (Ding et al. 2010). The 
alerting polymer PF4OX on electrochemical reduction produced electrochromic 
properties by acting as an n-type polymer. The presence of oxadiazole segments in the 
poly(9,9-dioxtylfluorence) chain imparted stability to the polymer and electrochemical 
reduction, which led to color change from colorless (neutral form) to rosy red at 
the electron-charged state and displayed a switching time of 1.1 s. The absorption 
profile of the polymer revealed two-absorption bands at 510 nm and 560 nm. The 
absorption band at 510 nm was attributed to the polaron on the fluorene unit, while the 
560 nm peak was attributed to the polaron on the oxadiazole segment. The polymer 
film displayed high stability during the electrochromic switching and a 30% loss 
of transmittance change in 500 potential square wave cycles. FT-IR-based studies 
revealed the decay of the electrochromic performance of the film on the formation 
of fluorenone and quinone defects on the fluorene unit in the copolymer chain. Laser 
flash photolysis-based studies revealed high electron localization potential and 
vulnerability to attack by oxygen to form the defects. These defects act as charge 
carrier traps and producte a pair of inner peaks at –1.84 and 1.03 V in the cyclic 
voltammetry test of copolymer film. The study demonstrated the potential of the 
polymer for developing an electrochromic device.

Oxadiazole-Based 
Heterocyclic Compounds 
as Chemical Probes in 
Live Cell Imaging 
1. Introduction 
Oxadiazoles are five-membered heterocyclic compounds that belong to the aromatic 
azole family. Out of four different isomers of oxadiazole, 1,2,4-oxadiazole, 
and 1,3,4-oxadiazole exhibit a diverse range of chemical as well as biological 
characteristics. These heterocyclic scaffolds (1,3,4-oxadiazole) are used as primary 
synthons during drug manufacturing (Siwach and Verma 2020). Additionally, 
1,3,4-oxadiazole-based probes exhibit high fluorescence quantum yield and good 
thermal and chemical stability (Hughes and Bryce 2005). These electron-deficient 
heterocyclic compounds can unravel remarkable biological phenomena when linked 
with suitable functional moieties. For example, (i) attachment of 18F ligand to the 
basic oxadiazole derivative could potentially map abnormal tissues in the body, 
and (ii) modification of oxadiazole-based structure with 123/125I could map the exact 
location of cholinergic nerve loss in case of dementia. 
Two of its positions on the ring can be substituted with different groups to 
yield a range of useful compounds (Maan et al. 2021). The covalent attachment 
of oxadiazole with fluorophores provides a brighter fluorescence response. These 
fluorescent probes could be utilized for cell function labeling, pH indicators, and 
intracellular metal ion quantification. Oxadiazole derivatives are also being explored 
as chelating motifs owing to their rich coordination characteristics. Potential metal 
ions such as Zn2+ and Fe3+/Fe2+ might be suitable for binding with the oxadiazole 
precursor in the presence of a suitable functional group such as hydroxyl moiety. N

2. Oxadiazole-Based Probes in PET Imaging 
Positron emission tomography (PET) is one of the advanced non-invasive imaging 
tools to investigate the biochemical nature of tissues and organs. During the PET 
scanning process, a radioactive drug called “tracer” is normally used in order to 
visualize the bright signals. This type of imaging is more suitable for abnormal tissue 
detection; therefore, it is more frequently used in cancer detection. Applications 
of oxadiazole-based synthetic probes as radiotracers in PET imaging are 
explained below. 
The subtype sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) exhibits inflammatory 
importance among G-protein-coupled receptors. Rosenberg et al. developed fluorine 
(18F) tagged S1P probe 1 in a multi-step synthetic process (Rosenberg et al. 2016). 
The synthetic ligand that contains centrally positioned 1,2,4-oxadiazole moiety 
exhibited high selectivity (> 100-fold) as well as high potency (2.63 nM) toward 
S1P1 and accumulated in the mouse liver during in vivo evaluation. Studies like 
microPET imaging, in vitro autoradiography, and biodistribution confirmed 18F 
tagged ligand 1 as a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for S1P1 and 
could be used for LPS-induced liver injury with increased expression of S1P1. Luo 
et al. developed triazole functionalized probe 2 by modifying the earlier version of 
azetidine-3-carboxylic acid-based ligand with hydroxymethyl capped triazole moiety 
with around 14.1% radiochemical yield and 54.1 GBq/ȝ mol specific activity (Luo 
et al. 2018). The biodistribution analysis found interesting results where the 
fluorinated probe can enter the blood-brain barrier with 0.71% ID/g brain uptake 
following 1 h of injection (Figure 1). Additionally, the uptake was shortened by 
a specific S1PR1 ligand called SEW2871, confirmed by in vitro autoradiography 
analysis. The 18F labeled probe might be useful for inflammatory evaluation as a PET 
radiotracer. Oxadiazole-Based Heterocyclic Compounds as Chemical Probes in Live Cell Imaging 111

were euthanized after 5, 30, 60, and 120 min injections. %ID/gram values (mean ± SD) with 4 rats per 
group. Reprinted with permission from Elsevier (Luo et al. 2018). 
In 2018, The same group (Luo et al.) also developed a series of 
fluorine-substituted S1PR1 probes 3–5 (Luo et al. 2018). The compounds 3–5 
displayed strong binding tendencies toward the S1PR1 ligand with IC50 values 
of 6.7 ± 0.7, 14.0 ± 0.4, and 15.4 ± 3.3 nM, respectively. Radiolabelling these 
compounds with F-18 resulted in high-yield compounds with more than 98% purity. 
The synthesized radiolabelled probes could penetrate the blood-brain barrier, which 
might be useful for in vivo response in inflammatory models in the future. 
Visualization of type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2) has significant advantages 
in quantification of neuro-inflammation and clinical settings. The CB2 receptor is 
mainly expressed in immune cells (Gazzi et al. 2022). Ahamed et al. developed 
N-arylamide functionalized oxadiazole derivatives labeled with 11C and 18F (Ahamed 
et al. 2016). The binding affinity for the human CB2 receptor was found to be 
87 nM and 0.8 nM with probes 6 and 8, respectively. The EC50 values for probes 
6 and 8 were estimated to be 3 and 0.1 nM, respectively, which were confirmed as 
potent CB2 receptor agonists. The synthesized probes 7 and 9 exhibited good brain 
uptake along with appropriate clearance from blood, which suggested that these 
probes could be useful for PET in vivo imaging of CB2 receptors. In another study, 
probe 9 exhibited a longer half-life (109.8 min) and greater affinity toward CB2 
receptor agonist (Ki
 ~ 0.8 nM) (Attili et al. 2019).

inhibitors. 
The histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzyme eliminates acetyl moiety from the 
lysine part of histone protein through the deacetylation process. This catalytic 
method regulates oncogene expression and cell-cycle progression (Ropero and 
Esteller 2007). HDAC is known as a promising target for chemotherapy. The 
trifluoromethyloxadiazolyl (TFMO) is a unique class-IIa HDAC pharmacophore 
that coordinates with the Zn2+ ion in the catalytic pocket. Therefore, Turkman et al. 
developed an 18F labeled oxadiazole scaffold (> 98% radiochemical purity) through 
radiofluorination from bromodifluoromethyl attached oxadiazole (Turkman et al. 
2021). The probe worked as a class-IIa HDAC inhibitor. Oxadiazole-Based Heterocyclic Compounds as Chemical Probes in Live Cell Imaging 113

3. Oxadiazole-Based Probes for SPECT Imaging 
Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is another non-invasive 
imaging technique used for mapping 3-dimensional images of organs, tissues, bones, 
etc. In vivo visualization of amyloid-ȕ (A ȕ) deposition in the brain facilitates early 
diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (Chen et al. 2014). In this instance, SPECT is useful 
for visualizing amyloid pathology (Okumura et al. 2018). Additionally, SPECT 
imaging offers cheaper operating costs in comparison to PET imaging, which makes 
them suitable for primary screening of cerebral ȕ-amyloidosis (Ono et al. 2013). 
Some of the iodinated (including 123/125I labeled) synthetic probes based on oxadiazole 
derivatives are discussed as follows. 
In 2009, Watanabe et al. reported a series of iodine-attached 1,3,4-oxadiazole￾based probes 14–19 (Watanabe et al. 2009). These probes exhibited good affinity 
toward A ȕ 42 aggregates (Ki
 ~ 20–349 nM). Excellent in vitro results were observed 
in mouse model with fluorescent staining of ȕ-amyloid plaques. 
In 2014, Watanabe et al. tailored oxadiazole probes 20–21 in three synthetic 
steps from commercially available 4-bromobenzoic hydrazide and 3-bromobenzoic 
hydrazide respectively (Watanabe et al. 2014). The developed iodinated probes 
20–21 exhibited significant affinity (25 and 14 nM) toward Aȕ (1–42) aggregates in 
in vitro experiments. Injection in the mouse revealed good penetration ability and 
fast washout. These probes, when labeled with 123I, exhibited plaque localization 
owing to the specific binding of Aȕ plaques.

Myelin covers neuronal axons as a protective shield that facilitates neuronal 
signal conduction. Once the myelin is defaced because of neurodegenerative 
diseases, neuronal axons become more prone to damage. In 2022, Watanabe et al. 
also published an article (Watanabe et al. 2022). Probe 22b successfully detected 
myelin in the mouse brain after 1 h of injection. Further, demyelination was noticed 
in the presence of probe 22b in the brain and spinal cord of the mouse. Interestingly, 
demyelination (Figure 2) was noticed only in the brain on injection of probe 22a 
during SPECT imaging. 
4. Oxadiazole-Based Probes as Enzyme Markers 
Overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme results in cancer-related health 
conditions. Also, the production of prostaglandins directly affects tissue invasion, 
metastasis carcinogenesis, etc. (De Vries 2006). Therefore, detection of COX-2 
expression is important for early diagnosis and treatment. Kaur et al. developed a 
range of fluorescent probes 23–27 utilizing a click chemistry approach (Kaur et al. 
2021). The azide derivative 23a is an excellent cell permeable intermediate, forming 
a COX-2 specific fluorescent probe through “in cell” click chemistry in the presence Oxadiazole-Based Heterocyclic Compounds as Chemical Probes in Live Cell Imaging 115

signal in HCA-7 cells. 
5. Oxadiazole-Based Probes in Protein Imaging 
Fluorogenic probes are considered efficient markers owing to their spatial and 
temporal sensitivity. These are extensively used for monitoring protein translocation 
and imaging within living cells. Baranczak et al. studied the imaging response of 
a fluorosulfate-attached oxadiazole probe 28 (Baranczak et al. 2015). Efficient 
binding (2 nM) of the transthyretin (TTR) was observed when probe 28 was added 
to HEK293T cells. The probe could successfully penetrate live HEK293T cells 
and visualize exogenous transthyretin in the endoplasmic reticulum as well as the 
mitochondria compartment. Ono et al. developed a series of ȕ-amyloid probes 
29–33 that consist of a centrally located oxadiazole motif (Ono et al. 2008). 125I 
labeled synthetic probes (29–32) exhibited remarkable uptake during imaging (2.2 to 
3.3% ID/g). However, due to non-specific binding, these four 125I labeled probes 
washed out slowly from the brain during in vivo studies. Further modification of the 116 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry

probe structure is required for fast washout. In vitro studies confirmed significant

6. Nitric Oxide Imaging 
In 2019, Han et al. developed a nitric oxide responsive fluorescent probe 34a utilizing 
a thiosemicarbazide derivative (Scheme 1) and a coumarin unit (Han et al. 2018). 
The synthetic probe displayed a fast turn-on fluorescence response in the presence of 
nitric oxide both in buffer solution and in live MCF-7 cells, and it finally produced 
the fluorescent probe 34b. The limit of detection during nitric oxide interaction was 
calculated to be 47.6 nM. The authors also demonstrated endogenous nitric oxide 
imaging in the zebrafish model using the probe 34a.

7. Oxadiazole-Based Probes for Metal Ion Imaging 
Oxadiazole is employed as an excellent metal ion chelator owing to the presence 
of suitable heteroatoms such as nitrogen and oxygen in its parent structure (Sahoo 
et al. 2017). Until recently, oxadiazole has been utilized in various metal ions 
imaging, including alkaline earth metals (Ca2+), transition metal ions such as Fe2+, 
and heavy metal ions such as Zn2+ and Cd2+. Oxadiazole-Based Heterocyclic Compounds as Chemical Probes in Live Cell Imaging 117 
7.1 Al3+ Imaging 
Manjunath et al. designed a receptor 35 with two rhodamine units attached 
through an oxadiazole moiety (Manjunath et al. 2015). The probe was isolated as 
a pale yellow solid in 80% synthetic yield. A distinct pink color, as well as pink 
fluorescence, appeared with the addition of Al3+ into a probe solution in aqueous 
acetonitrile. Excellent emission response was noticed at 568 nm upon adding Al3+ 
ions to the probe solution. The synthetic probe penetrated MDA-MB-231 breast 
cancer cells with no detectable fluorescence. However, injection of Al3+ resulted in 
red fluorescence during cell imaging experiments, indicating selective detection of 
Al3+ in live cells.

Liu et al. developed a ratiometric fluorescent probe 36 utilizing BAPTA as a chelator 
for Ca2+ coordination (Scheme 2), an electron-deficient 1,3,4-oxadiazole unit, and 
an electron-rich ethoxy benzene (Liu et al. 2013). In the presence of increasing Ca2+ 
ion concentrations, the original UV-visible bands at 305 and 380 nm were reduced, 
whereas the band at 380 nm shifted to 350 nm with a distinct color change from 
orange to greenish yellow. The probe exhibited excellent selectivity toward Ca2+ ions 
with a very high Stokes shift of 202 nm owing to the presence of a conjugated system 
ZLWK D ODUJH ʌHOHFWURQ²FRRUGLQDWLRQ RI &D2+-induced emission spectral shifting 
from 582 nm to 490 nm with evolution of bright green fluorescence. Interestingly, 
the probe was utilized to detect intracellular Ca2+ fluctuation in live HUVEC (human 
umbilical vein endothelial) cells. 
7.3 Fe2+/3+ Imaging 
Gong et al. developed a fluorescent probe 38, which consists of pyridine carboxylic 
acid moieties and a 1,3,4-oxadiazole unit (Gong et al. 2019). The fluorescence 
response (intensity at 354 nm) of the probe was quenched significantly upon the 
addition of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in aqueous solution. A 1:1 Binding coordination was 
observed between the oxadiazole probe and the iron species. A low limit of detection 
was envisaged, particularly 6.95 ȝM for Fe3+ and 7.78 ȝM for Fe2+, respectively, 118 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry

during metal coordination. The fluorescent probe exhibited good cell permeability 
in HepG2 cells. 
7.4 Zn2+ Imaging 
The existence of potential coordination sites such as nitrogen and oxygen atoms 
makes these oxadiazole derivatives notable scaffolds for metal ion binding. 
Zhou et al. developed a Zn2+ imaging tool where the synthetic probe 39 is made 
up of 2-hydroxy-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole as a chelating site (Zhou et al. 2012). 
The probe successfully detected Zn2+ ions in aqueous CH3CN by following 1:1 
binding coordination. The addition of Zn2+ resulted in a dramatic enhancement 
of fluorescence intensity at 439 nm (~ 65 fold) with an association constant of 
1.6 × 105 M–1. Significant fluorescence response was noticed from fluorescence 
microscopy studies of probe 39 in the presence of Zn2+ in liver cancer (Hep G2) cells 
owing to excellent cell penetration ability and electrophilic attack of zinc ion to the 
oxygen atom of phenol unit. 
Tang et al. prepared a fluorescent probe 40 in 72% yield utilizing 
2,5-diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole scaffold and dipicolylamine unit (Tang et al. 2014). 
It detected Zn2+ selectively following an ESIPT (excited state intramolecular proton 
transfer) mechanism in pure water at physiological pH. The Zn2+ coordination 
followed 1:1 binding stoichiometry with a red-shifted emission enhancement at O O O

probe exhibited good cell penetration and detected Cd2+ with bright emission in 
MCF-7 cells. O COOH

Zhang et al. developed a small molecule probe 43 where 4-nitro-benzo[1,2,5] 
oxadiazole is covalently attached to a morpholine moiety through an aminoethylene 
bridge (Zhang et al. 2016). The synthesized fluorescent probe 43 detected Hg2+ in live 
HeLa cells and exhibited better biocompatibility and cell-permeable characteristics. 
Single crystal x-ray studies revealed the 2:2 binding geometry of Hg2+ with the probe, 
where Hg2+ is held together by nitrogen atoms of morpholine and the amino group. 
8. Oxadiazole-Based Probes for pH Imaging 
Huang et al. developed a carboxylic acid-based pH activatable probe 44 in 45% yield 
utilizing folate residue with 4-nitro-benzo[1,2,5]oxadiazole fluorophore attached 
piperazine precursor (Huang et al. 2012). The developed probe exhibited remarkable 
fluorescence enhancement (~ 30 fold) under an acidic environment (pK = 5.70). a
Interestingly, it was able to respond to pH changes in cancerous live cells and might 
be useful for mapping intracellular pH distributions. 
9. Oxadiazole-Based Probes in Cell Imaging and Nrf2 Activation 
Oxadiazole-based probes have been utilized in various ways in disease prevention 
and cell biology. Due to its significant therapeutical efficacy, oxadiazole motifs are 
used in brain tissue targeting (Xu et al. 2019), Nrf2 activation (Xu et al. 2018), and 
neuro-protective agents (Lin et al. 2020). The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related 
factor 2 (Nrf2) is widely accepted as the master regulator of an antioxidant defense 
system. Nrf2 translocation in cell organelles can be monitored using oxadiazole 
derivatives (Xu et al. 2016). Some recent applications of oxadiazole probes in cell 
imaging studies are highlighted below. Oxadiazole-Based Heterocyclic Compounds as Chemical Probes in Live Cell Imaging 121

Jin et al. tailored carbazole-decorated conjugated fluorescent probes 45–48 
attached with triphenylamine and 1,3,4-oxadiazole unit (Jin and Qian 2015). 
Spectroscopic data from a mixed solvent of water-THF suggested intramolecular 
charge transfer as well as aggregation-induced emission behavior. Fabrication of 
dye-loaded silica nanoparticles improved biocompatibility, and at the same time, 
dye-loaded Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) nanoparticles exhibited excellent uptake 
by HeLa cells in cell imaging studies. 
Li et al. synthesized a triphenylamine-centered conjugated probe 49 attached 
with a BODIPY fluorophore using a palladium-catalyzed Heck coupling reaction in 
54.8% yield (Li and Qian 2017). The probe displayed an excellent red fluorescence 
in the solid state (Ȝ = 614 nm). The THF solution exhibited two emission bands em
(647 and 513 nm) with fluorescence quantum yields of 0.11 and 0.01, respectively. 
The fluorescence intensity of the probe enhanced in the presence of an increasing 
concentration of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), indicating a BSA selective N

Mambwe et al. optimized an ester containing astemizole (a second-generation 
antihistamine) compound using an iterative medicinal chemistry approach and 
obtained a highly bioactive candidate 50a (Mambwe et al. 2022). Probe 50a was tested 
for its efficacy studies, which displayed strong in vitro activity with an IC50 (PfNF54) 
value 0.012 ȝM w.r.t drug-sensitive strain of P. falciparum. It also displayed excellent 
in vivo potency in the mouse model. In order to obtain live cell imaging results, the 
authors have installed an extrinsic fluorophore such as nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) 
to the parent structure to yield 50b as a fluorescent probe. A significant accumulation 
of probe 50b was observed around hemozoin crystals in super-resolution structured 
illumination microscopy images. Oxadiazole-Based Heterocyclic Compounds as Chemical Probes in Live Cell Imaging 123

Xie et al. prepared polyoxadiazole derivative 51 in 61% yield through a 
multicomponent polymerization process (catalyst-free), which ensured better 
film-forming capacity, good solubility, and high thermal stability (Xie et al. 2023). 
The polymerized probe exhibited excellent solid-state fluorescence response due to 
the presence of aggregation-induced emission part in the host system. The probe also 
exhibited bright blue fluorescence in 4T1 cells, which confirmed good cell staining 
potential and was found to be selective toward lysosomes. 
In order to obtain the best possible Nrf2 activators, Xu et al. screened 
7,500 compounds and obtained a very potent probe 52, which displayed the best 
cell permeability as well as good solubility (Xu et al. 2015). Pharmacological 
investigations such as in vivo studies revealed that probe 52 effectively suppressed 
inflammation in LPS-challenged mice. Nucleus translocation of Nrf2 was also 
visualized using an immunofluorescence assay (Figure 3). Strong fluorescence signal

in the nucleus from confocal images shows that Nrf2 translocated into the nucleus in 
a concentration-dependent fashion. 
The Nrf2 protein plays a significant role in various enzyme expressions as 
well as antioxidant protein activation. Dai et al. developed several oxadiazole￾based probes 53–55 (Dai et al. 2022). Compound 53 is a biotin-based probe, and 
compound 54 is a fluorescent probe designed for Nrf2 activation purposes. These 
synthesized probes exhibited excellent antioxidant as well as anti-inflammatory 
responses similar to the commercially available Nrf2-ARE activator DDO-7263 (56). 
DDO-7263 mimic is based on a 1,2,4-oxadiazole positioned centrally and attached to 
difluorobenzene moiety in one end and methyl pyridine in the other end. It has good 
anti-inflammatory and Nrf2-activating properties. The binding affinity assay studies 
revealed that the synthesized probes displayed antioxidant behavior owing to the 
binding to a component of 26S proteasome called RPN6. The studies confirmed that 
the 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives promoted Nrf2 activation. 
10. Conclusions 
In this chapter, we have elucidated diverse sets of oxadiazole-based synthetic 
probes applicable in cell imaging applications. Although oxadiazole-based motifs 
are principal precursors in most drug candidates used in medicinal chemistry, few 
synthetic probes have been studied for live-cell imaging purposes. Therefore, a 
rational design of small molecule probes with structural diversity must be developed, 
including various subcellular targeting groups and tunable photophysical behavior. 
In the meantime, oxadiazole has been functionalized with different fluorophores 
such as quinoline, coumarin, rhodamine, di-(2-picolyl)amine, carbazole, BODIPY, 
etc., and with different chelating groups such as BAPTA. Besides that, oxadiazole 
has also been functionalized with targeting groups such as morpholine for selective 
targeting inside the lysosome compartment. The cell penetration efficiency of the 
synthesized probes has been discussed in various cell lines. Oxadiazole-Based Heterocyclic Compounds as Chemical Probes in Live Cell Imaging 125

Oxadiazole as Inhibitors
 
1. Introduction 
The development of antibiotics has significantly increased life expectancy. Antibiotics 
are the main hope for saving millions of lives from infections, which is believed to 
be of utmost importance. However, the danger from several drug-resistant bacterial 
infections is a serious threat to humankind (Bassetti et al. 2017). The chemical and 
nature-borne molecules that contain heterocyclic compounds are widely recognized 
as ligands, intermediates, inhibitors, agrochemicals, and veterinary treatments. They 
exhibit strong biological action against bacterial infections. In this context, oxadiazole 
and its derivatives, such as 1,2,4-oxadiazole, 1,3,4-oxadiazole, and 1,2,5-oxadiazole, 
are widely recognized as the most potent inhibitors against drug-resistant bacteria 
(Naclerio et al. 2019, 2020) because they are approved by many pharmaceuticals 
which encourage chemists to use them in the fields of medicinal chemistry, polymer 
and material science, and pesticide chemistry due to their ability to mimic esters and 
amides as bioisosteres (Verma et al. 2021a). 
The clinical success of ȕ-lactam antibiotics over the past few decades creates 
numerous prospects for developing novel penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 
inhibitors (Frimodt-Meller et al. 1986; Ford et al. 1996). Since PBPs are essential 
for the biosynthesis of cell walls, they are still prime targets for antibiotics. Since 
biofilms are responsible for almost 65% of current human bacterial infections, they 
are also a significant target for medication. The biofilm will be the main cause of 
bacterial infections in the near future (Verma et al. 2021a). Methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, as noted by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) in its 2013 report, causes high morbidity and mortality 
(Verma et al. 2021a). In order to combat such infections, oxazolidinones are easily 
accessible oral drugs that are highly recommended over licensed drugs such as 
vancomycin, telavancin, daptomycin, ceftaroline, linezolid, and tedizolid (Kaka et al. 
2006). Oxadiazole isosters are a superior structural alteration for oxazolidinones. The 
oxadiazole moiety is a significant structural motif in bioorganic and pharmaceutical 
chemistry, as well as a fundamental building block in organic chemistry (Salassa and 
Terenzi 2016). Due to its therapeutic potential in numerous medicinal applications 
and simplicity of preparation, it attracts a great deal of interest from a wide range Oxadiazole as Inhibitors 129 
of researchers. Due to their enhanced resistance to esterases’ hydrolytic cleavage, 
oxadiazole is crucial in the bioisosterism of esters and amides (Verma et al. 2021b). 
Importantly, oxadiazole and its derivatives are attracting the most attention as 
the preferable anticancer medications. Since current anticancer medications inhabit 
many enzymes and growth regulators that control cell development, their effects are 
carried out by suppressing cells (Matore et al. 2022). According to numerous studies, 
the ideal target for developing anticancer medications and preventing metastasis is 
the suppression of angiogenesis (Carmeliet et al. 2005). The histone proteins play 
crucial roles in regulating gene expression by altering numerous chemical events, 
like acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) 
inhibitors can regulate genes and ultimately exert control over the numerous elements 
essential for the growth and spread of cancer (Bi et al. 2006; Eckschlager et al. 2017). 
This chapter provides a thorough overview of the structure-activity relationship 
(SAR) of oxadiazole scaffolds as inhibitors against MRSA strains and therapeutic 
potential on various HDAC enzymes and anticancer activity. 
2. The Derivatized Compound From Oxadiazole: 
A Potential Inhibitor 
2.1 Inhibitors as Anti-Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA) Agents 
The fundamental structural difference between pathogenic bacteria and healthy 
cells provides significant insights for creating novel antibiotic substances. Bacterial 
infections are becoming harder to recover, necessitating the development of 
new, attractive strategies for infection control. In order to repair and regenerate 
soft tissue in wounds, a variety of antibacterial wound-healing hydrogels have 
been used, including hydrogels with inorganic antibacterial chemicals. The key 
drawbacks of the current inorganic hydrogels are their cytotoxicity, lack of sensitive 
non-degradability, and crucial developments. The oxadiazole ring, a potent inhibitor, 
is frequently utilized to treat diverse diseases; structural modification of this moiety 
to combat MRSA by using various substituents to increase metabolic stability is 
extensively researched (Manukumar et al. 2017). 
Amphiphilic cell antimicrobials using oxadiazole-moiety-incorporated 
poly(-caprolactone)-poly (-ethylene glycol)-poly(-caprolactone) (PCEC-QAS) 13 
have been studied to treat the MRSA-infected lesion. They are efficient against MRSA 
and E. coli both in vitro and in vivo, mainly due to their remarkable thermal stability 
up to 50°C. PCEC-QAS promotes wound healing without using outside medications 
and grows thick epidermis on impaired skin wounds like normal skin. This makes it an 
emerging skin-regenerating material that prevents bacterial infection. This has been 
confirmed by the Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, which shows 
that changes in the membrane potential directly impact the cytoplasmic components 
because QAS electrostatic interactions with bacteria cause the MRSA cell membrane 
damage. The absence of the oxadiazole ring in PCEC-QAS is thought to be the cause 
of its non-cytotoxicity rather than the presence of hydrocarbon chains, which could 
cause cytotoxicity due to their capacity to pass through cell membranes. The 3T3 130 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
cells’ cytocompatibility with PCEC-QAS demonstrated good cell proliferation. The 
in vivo studies give a clear understanding of hydrogel degradation, which is required 
for any antibacterial agents to become non-toxic (Liu et al. 2020). 
By developing the thiazol-oxadiazole core with various lipophilic, hydrophilic, 
lipophobic, and hydrophobic structural units, the antibacterial activity and 
pharmacokinetic properties are improved. Several oxadiazole derivatives 
demonstrated considerable activity against MRSA (2658 RCMB), with MIC values 
ranging from 1.95 to 3.90 mg/mL. Vancomycin was equally effective against 
compounds with guanidine and piperazine moieties with a MIC of 1.95 mg/mL. 
The SAR demonstrated that longer chain/sterically hindered groups on amines with 
aliphatic alkyl or alicyclic portion significantly decrease the activity against MRSA 
compared to shorter amines with less than four carbon atoms. Interestingly, MRSA 
was successfully combated by amines with polar attachments, such as guanidine, 
piperazine, hydroxyazetidine, and morpholine, respectively (Hannoun et al. 2020). 
Different heterocycle conjugates have recently been investigated as possible 
scaffolds with good selectivity and efficiency against various biological targets 
(Chen et al. 2017; Ravindar et al. 2018). Similarly, oxadiazole showed increased 
resistance to MRSA after conjugation with thiophene heterocycle. To create a 
SAR, the oxadiazole core has been combined with a polysubstituted thiophene 
ring. S. aureus, P. auregenosa, B. pumilus and E. coli were used as test organisms 
to determine the antibacterial potency. The results showed a strong inhibition with 
the 4-fluorophenyl group, which was highly encouraging. This might result from 
fluorine’s medicinal effects and its metabolic stability. Studies on growth kinetics 
demonstrated the superior inhibitory capacity against S. aureus (Singla et al. 2020). 
On the oxadiazole core, various aryl groups added at the second and fifth carbons 
were effective against a variety of bacterial strains, including MRSA 16. The SAR 
demonstrated that the bromo group is suitable for preventing the growth of bacterial 
strains in the ortho position of the benzene ring in the second and fifth positions of the 
oxadiazole moiety. While other functional groups, such as nitro and methyl, do not 
exhibit significant action against any of the tested strains, the chlorine substitution 
on the aryl ring demonstrated modest activity. The compound’s greater activity may 
be due to the bromine atom’s bulkiness, which can adhere to microbe cells and cause 
apoptosis (Zabiulla et al. 2020). The oxadiazole derivates showing antibacterial 
activity are presented in Figure 1. 
Many Gram-positive bacteria, including S. aureus, can thrive and reproduce due 
to teichoic acid and lipoteichoic acid (LTA) polymers that make up the peptidoglycan 
layer of Gram-positive bacteria anchored with teichoic acid. LTA is an interesting 
target for developing growth inhibitors for diverse Gram-positive bacterial strains 
because it is not present in eukaryotic cells. Researchers were motivated to create new 
pharmacophores because of restricted exposure to the LTA biosynthesis inhibitor. 
Drugs such as vancomycin and linezolid (1 and 2 mg/mL) were significantly less 
effective against MRSA than the new candidates of 1,3,4-oxadiazol-benzamides 
(ATCC 33592). According to the SAR, the activity is increased by highly 
electron-withdrawing groups like CF3, F, and Cl, while it is decreased by hydrophilic 
moieties like OH, NH2, tetrazole, and CN. The most effective analog with para-CF3 Oxadiazole as Inhibitors 131 
Figure 1. Oxadiazole compounds represent potent antibacterial agents against MRSA. 
(Verma et al. 2021a). 
Figure 2. Selected benzamidooxadiazoles with improved potency against MRSA (Verma et al., 2021a). 
(MIC: 0.25 mg/mL) and its meta-analog showed MIC of 11 mg/mL against MRSA, 
demonstrating the essential impact. Along with the common LTA biosynthesis 
inhibitor 1771, the molecule is chosen for the mechanistic action for its inhabiting 
bacterial infection (Naclerio et al. 2019) (Figure 2). 
Due to low polarizability and high electronegativity, fluorine has attractive 
pharmacokinetic features that researchers have incorporated into molecular scaffolds 
to achieve excellent efficacy and bioavailability. For example, fluorine-containing 
groups such as trifluoromethylsulfonyl, pentafluorosulfonyl, trifluoromethylthio, and 132 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
trifluoromethoxy play an excellent role when conjugated with oxadiazole. Most of 
these fluorine-containing groups are found in FDA-approved drugs and are essential 
for boosting the corresponding action. They are effective against MRSA, which 
exhibits highly tolerable to Caco-2 cells (colorectal cells), even at a higher dose of 
128 mg/mL, which is 256 times more than the corresponding MICs against MRSA 
ATCC 33,592 and suggests these compounds to be a good antibiotic candidate. 
Furthermore, fluorine-decorated oxadiazoles were safe for RBCs at concentrations 
greater than 128 mg/mL and caused 50% hemolysis in RBCs, indicating only a 
low level of hemolysis in human RBCs. Combination therapy, such as radio and 
chemotherapy or combining two different drugs, is an emerging method of treating 
many infections (Naclerio et al. 2019, 2020). 
The trans-translation represents a good target for antibiotics. Due to the 
participation in the ribosome rescue mechanism, in which transfer-messenger 
RNA (tmRNA)-SmpB is involved in proteolysis when used against S. aureus, a 
drug-resistant organism, small-molecule inhibitors like the 1,3,4-oxadiazole core 
have antibacterial properties. Results from biochemical analysis and cross-linking 
showed that it selectively inhibits bacteria from translating instead of doing so by 
binding to a location on 23S rRNA that is not recognized by any other drug. With 
MIC values of 0.64 mg/mL and 0.35 mg/mL against MRSA USA300 and 1.28 mg/mL 
and 0.7 mg/mL against Newman and MRSA252 strains, respectively, the derivatized 
drug inhibits numerous S. aureus strains, including MRSA. Following more research, 
it was utilized to compare it to antibiotics like daptomycin and chloramphenicol to 
determine the way of inhibiting S. aureus. While co-treatment with LL-37 (a human 
antimicrobial peptide) resulted in the synergistic growth inhibition of S. aureus, most 
antibiotics failed to demonstrate additive interaction and were, therefore, determined 
to be harmless to mammalian Hela cells and human HepG2 cells (Huang et al. 2019). 
The difficult objective in the drug development program for antibacterial 
medicines is to create new pharmacophores with high biological half-lives and 
strong metabolic stability. An excellent place to start is with oxadiazole in the search 
for such antibacterial compounds. When tested against MRSA (2658 RCMB), 
structurally diverse thiazole conjugated 1,3,4-oxadiazoles showed inhibitory efficacy 
ranging from 4 to 16 mg/mL (Kotb et al. 2019). According to SAR, guanidine and 
hydrazine derivatives are produced when the side chain on nitrogen is extended, 
which results in a one-fold reduction in activity. Nitrogen-atom-containing cyclic 
rings further reduced the activity. However, it was discovered that for the eradication 
of MRSA biofilms, azithromycin was superior to vancomycin since it disrupted 41% 
of the adherent biofilm at 2X MIC concentration, but vancomycin only disrupted 
34% of the MRSA biofilm mass at 32X MIC concentration. With a half-life of 
5.5 hours, in vivo pharmacokinetic tests showed good metabolic stability. Compared 
to its guanidine analog, the oxadiazole ring significantly increased the bioavailability 
and stability (Verma et al. 2021b). 
Alkyl/alkenyl/hydroxy alkenyl with varying chain lengths attached to the fifth 
position of oxadiazole with an aromatic and heteroaromatic ring at the second 
position has been developed in response to the antibacterial potential of oxadiazole 
analogs (Farshori et al. 2017). FtsZ is a bacterial division protein suggested Oxadiazole as Inhibitors 133 
as a potential target for synthesizing antibacterial drugs to stop the growth of 
drug-resistant bacteria. According to the study, a methicillin-resistant strain of 
S. aureus (ATCC43300) has a MIC of 1 mg/mL, which is equal to a penicillin 
(MIC: 1 mg/mL), superior to linezolid (MIC: 2 mg/mL) and erythromycin 
(MIC: > 64 mg/mL), and inferior to ciprofloxacin (MIC: 0.25 mg/mL). According 
to the SAR analysis, the longer alkyl chain facilitates switching the positions of the 
substituents on the oxadiazole ring and replacing the oxadiazole with a heterocycle 
with negative activity (Bi et al. 2019). 
Oxadiazole’s bioavailability needed to be improved due to its extensive use in 
medicines as antibiotics. This included enhancing efficacy, decreasing cytotoxicity, 
raising selectivity, and creating new oxadiazole hybrids to combat rapidly emerging 
drug-resistant bacterial strains. Since many bacteria are now resistant to norfloxacin, a 
derivatized form of the drug must be created in order to combat bacterial resistance. In 
order to increase the hydrophobicity and the activity of norfloxacin, 1,3,4-oxadiazole 
has been added to its structural design. Three clinical isolates of MRSA1-3 were 
tested against four norfloxacin-1,3,4 oxadiazole analogs. Unexpectedly, the 
compounds demonstrated superior action to the precursor norfloxacin, with MICs in 
the range of 0.5, 0.25, and 1 mg/mL. 
According to the SAR analysis, methoxy, chloro, bromo, and methyl groups 
were appropriately substituted, which increased the activity that efficiently damaged 
the membrane of MRSA2 and caused irreparable harm to the bacteria (Guo et al. 
2019). A large variety of biologically active scaffolds rely on quaternary ammonium 
salts (QAS), which typically adsorb on negatively charged species on cell walls and 
impact the cells. As a result, 1,3,4-oxadiazoles were also used to make quaternary 
salts to test their antibacterial effectiveness against MRSA. The inhibitory results 
indicate that synthetic quaternary salts of oxadiazoles were 100 times more effective 
against MRSA than the control gentamicin (MIC: 100 mg/mL) (ATCC 43300). Based 
on the findings, 1,3,4-oxadiazole, and QA’s derivatives could make an attractive 
model platform for studies of antibacterial drugs in the future (Rohand et al. 2019). 
In another study, dihydropyrimidine bound to 1,3,4-oxadiazole analogs was 
tested against five different bacterial strains, including MRSA (ATCC 43300), 
which demonstrated moderate to better activity and did not exhibit much toxicity 
to HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells) and less hemolytic activity in human 
whole blood cells (Dinesh and Jignasu 2019). It is well known that biofilms exhibit 
strong antibiotic resistance, although, in the presence of antimicrobials, biofilms 
could not perform as well as planktonic cell development (Spoering and Lewis 
2001). It is advised to create newer antibacterial agents that can successfully prevent 
biofilm development and eliminate planktonic cells’ capacity for resistance. Three 
novel 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives were tested to see how well they worked against 
S. aureus biofilms and planktonic cells as antibacterial agents. When tested against 
two MRSA strains with MBC values ranging from 8 to 64 mg/mL, all three drugs 
demonstrated inclusive inhibition. S. aureus MW2 and USA300 planktonic cells 
were utilized to test the antimicrobial activity at 4 X MIC concentration, and all 
the compounds were toxic to S. aureus growth. Additionally, it demonstrated 134 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
biofilm inhibition at a dosage of 16 mg/mL, which is sufficient to stop the growth of 
S. aureus and biofilms (Zheng et al. 2018). 
The Į-amino phosphate group’s demanding biological activity profile drew 
researchers to include it in a bioactive heterocyclic system to increase the effectiveness 
of the molecular scaffolds against various biological targets. A unique group of 
1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives that contain Į-amino phosphate has been combined and 
tested for their biological effects on a variety of bacterial species, including MRSA. 
Compared to comparable amide analogs and the positive control drug gentamicin, 
Į-amino phosphate derivatives of oxadiazole efficiently suppressed the growth of 
the MRSA strain with a zone of inhibition spanning 17 to 29 mm. According to 
SAR, a key factor in modifying the activity was the location of EDG and EWGs on 
the aromatic ring next to the amino phosphate moiety. While mono substitution of 
fluoro and bromo resulted in lower activity, and strong electron-withdrawing (NO2) 
and strong electron-donating (OMe) groups weaken the activity, di-substitution of 
EWGs on the aromatic ring of a-amino phosphate derivatives (Cl and F) augment 
the activity (Boshta et al. 2018). Phenylthiazoles have been found to be effective 
antibiotics against multidrug-resistant staphylococcal strains. The effectiveness of 
each molecule was tested against a variety of bacterial infections, including MRSA. 
It showed inhibition ranges from 12.5 to 50 mg/mL, which is better than the MIC of 
ciprofloxacin (MIC: 6.25 mg/mL) (Mohammad et al. 2014; Seleem et al. 2016). By 
adding a nitrogenous head and a lipophilic tail, these compounds can be made more 
metabolically stable, although doing so degrades their water solubility and makes 
their aqueous solubility poorer (Mohammad et al. 2015). The low oral bioavailability 
of antibacterial drugs with poor solubility is a key problem for all antibiotics. A 
polar oxadiazole ring with fewer carbon atoms and a higher polar surface area 
has been used to solve the problem of oral bioavailability. Secondary and tertiary 
amines on side chains of thiazole-conjugated oxadiazoles with nitrogenous heads 
were ineffective against MRSA (2658 RCMB). While nitrogenous head such as 
guanidine were discovered to be equally powerful as vancomycin, nitrogenous head 
such as hydrazine, piperazine, and hydroxyl azetidine showed superior MIC values. 
Increased morpholine and piperazine ring polarity on the nitrogenous sidechain 
further boost their anti-MRSA efficacy, with MICs of 1.56 and 1.17 mg/mL, 
respectively (2658 RCMB). Compared to vancomycin, the lead compound’s 
time-kill assay against MRSA indicated it is bactericidal. In vivo PK profiling 
revealed that the molecule had an oral bioavailability of 42.5%, was non-toxic at 
512 mg/mL to human colorectal cells (HRT-18), and had good aqueous solubility 
(Saq 14 104 mM) (Hagras et al. 2018) 
In order to test the ability to suppress MRSA biofilms, bromopyrrole alkaloids 
were derivatized with 1,3,4-oxadiazole, which has a thio-alkyl/aryl/heteroaryl 
ring in the second position of the ring (Rane et al. 2015). Most of the derivatives 
demonstrated significant biofilm inhibition against MRSA; the most potent 
compound was fourfold more active (MBIC: 0.78 mg/mL) than vancomycin 
(MBIC: 6.25 mg/mL), while the remainder of the molecules were equivalent to 
vancomycin. While thiophenyl and thio-ethyl at the second position on oxadiazole 
diminish the ant-biofilm activity, SAR suggests that halogen-, amino-, nitro-, and Oxadiazole as Inhibitors 135 
methoxy groups at the fourth position on the phenyl ring were superior for the biofilm 
inhibition. The substance’s antivirulence property is indicated by the fact that it did 
not affect the viability of bacteria at antibiofilm activity concentration (Verma et al. 
2021a). Ribonucleotide N5-carboxy-amino-imidazole (N5-CAIR) Mutase (PurE) is 
a bacterial enzyme that produces 4-carboxy-amino-imidazole ribonucleotide (CAIR) 
from 5-amino-imidazole ribonucleotide (AIR) and carbon dioxide (CO2) (Zhang 
et al. 2008; Tranchimand et al. 2011). It has been acknowledged that the de novo purine 
biosynthesis route is a legitimate target for discovering antibacterial compounds. The 
most effective method for finding hit compounds that can bind to a particular target 
in a biological system is high-throughput screening (HTS). 
A new class of oxadiazole-based phenyl-thiolatobismuth (III) complexes have 
been tested for their ability to combat MRSA. Compared to the simple oxadiazole 
thiones, the complex mono-phenyl bismuth (III) analogs demonstrated a wider range 
of action. With a MIC value of 1.1 mM, which is on par with vancomycin, complex 
[BiPh(Me-PTOT)2], it demonstrated dominating action against MRSA. Changing the 
para-substituents of the phenyl ring in the oxadiazole ring did not affect the activity 
profile. These compounds’ nontoxicity to cultivated mammalian COS-7 cell lines, 
even at 10 X MIC values (20 mg/mL), is a strong argument in favor of them. These 
complexes provide new opportunities for identifying antibacterial drugs due to their 
great proficiency and low toxicity (Kim et al. 2015; Luqman et al. 2015). 
In order to test the antibacterial effectiveness against MRSA, 4-thiazolidinedione 
has been attached to an oxadiazole ring while investigating various heterocycle 
conjugated derivatives (Narasimhamurthy et al. 2014; Girish et al. 2014a). Two new 
chemical libraries have been created and tested against two MRSA clinical isolates 
(CCARM 3167 and CCARM 3506) exhibit MIC ranges from 1 to 64 mg/mL. The 
compound that was chosen as the best in the library showed a MIC of 1 mg/mL 
against both MRSA strains, and it is equivalent to moxifloxacin (MIC: 1 mg/mL), two 
times more effective than gatifloxacin (MIC: 21 mg/mL), 64 times more active than 
oxacillin (MIC: > 64 mg/mL), and 4 to 8 times better than norflox. The thiazolidinone 
ring on the oxadiazole moiety could be further modified to improve the antibacterial 
action (Liu et al. 2014). Through the intramolecular cyclization of 2-(2-aroylaryloxy) 
acetohydrazides, ten 2-[2-(aroyl)aroyloxy]methyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives had 
been synthesized. These novel, structurally unique oxadiazole moieties were tested 
against MRSA and other bacterial strains and showed excellent inhibition activity 
(Girish et al. 2014b). Numerous naturally occurring compounds with nitropyrrole bases 
showed effective antibacterial properties (Wang et al. 1975; Santo et al. 1998; Raju 
et al. 2010; Kwon et al. 2010). The ability of 4-nitropyrrole-based chloramphenicol 
to combat drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus germs with MIC values up to 
0.8 mg/mL was also explained in a few papers. Given the effectiveness of nitro 
pyrrols, an effort was made to create 4-nitro pyrrole derivatives that contained 
1,3,4-oxadiazole to increase the efficacy further against drug-resistant bacteria, 
particularly MRSA (Rane et al. 2013). Due to the presence of many methyl groups, 
the development of 1,3,4-oxadiazol-benzamide analogs as antibacterial agents against 
methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant bacteria has proven particularly useful. At a 
MIC of 2 mg/ml, it prevents bacterial growth. The antibacteral efficacy against MRSA 136 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
in vivo was proven via the skin wound infection model (Opoku-Temeng et al. 2018). 
Living organisms are seriously threatened by drug-resistant bacterial infections. 
Multidrug-resistant bacteria are extremely difficult to treat. Oxadiazole will be a 
powerful inhibitor against bacterial infection thanks to its structural diversity, which 
promotes the development of many derivatives and thus demonstrates moderate to 
good activity against various bacterial strains. 
2.2 Inhibitors Against MRSA as Antibacterial Agents 
To better understand the SAR, 72 structurally diverse indole and pyrazole-substituted 
oxadiazole analogs were tested in vitro and in vivo for their antibacterial efficacy 
against ESKAPE strains, with a particular focus on S. aureus (ATCC 29213) 
(Boudreau et al. 2020). Methoxy and trifluoromethoxy at para-position and azide 
group at any position of the ring showed substantial MIC values against S. aureus. 
Hydrophobic substituents, especially halogens (F, Cl, Br, and I), on diphenyl ether 
rings at different places also worked well against S. aureus. Other substituents 
with low activity include methyl, alkyl carbamates, amides, tert-butyl, amines, 
and sulfonates. A phenyl ring’s activity against S. aureus is generally reduced by 
hydrogen-bond donor groups, and heterocyclic moieties like benzothiazole and 
pyridine can replace a phenyl ring and still be somewhat effective. Tetrahydrofuran, 
pyrrolidines, azetidines, and other hetero aliphatic ring systems fared inadequately 
against S. aureus (Boudreau et al. 2020) (Figure 3). 
In the mouse peritonitis model of MRSA infection, oxadiazoles constitute a 
non-ȕ-lactam inhibitor of cell-wall biosynthesis with a good action profile against 
multidrug-resistant MRSA and low clearance, more half-life and oral bioavailability 
of 97% (Janardhanan et al. 2016). A synergistic study with ȕ-lactam and 
non-ȕ-lactam antibiotics reveals the beneficial synergistic effect of ȕ-lactam 
antibiotics. Combination therapy is a useful strategy to battle drug-resistant bacterial 
strains. Oxacillin’s in vivo efficacy in a mouse neutropenic thigh infection model 
proved that combination therapy is more effective than single-agent therapy 
(Ceballos et al. 2018). 
The best treatment for both community- and hospital-acquired infections was 
an oxyazolidinone-based linezolid antibiotic drug with a distinct mechanism of 
action, dynamic pharmacokinetic properties, and 100% oral bioavailability, but 
soon after its introduction, it developed resistance to numerous multidrug-resistant 
bacteria (Dryden et al. 2011). Since 1,2,4-oxadiazole is a superior substitute for 
oxazolidinone, Fortuna et al. 2014 development of new antibacterial to combat drug￾resistant microorganisms also included thoroughly examining the SAR. A substantial 
amount of activity was seen with one of the series of drugs tested against clinical 
isolates of MRSA that were multidrug-resistant, with MIC values comparable to 
those of linezolid (1.6 mg/mL) at 3.125 mg/mL. In contrast to the aromatic fluoro 
substitution, the SAR demonstrated the additive ability of triazole to improve 
activity in the oxadiazole side chain. The racemic mixing state was blamed for the 
compounds’ lower action (Fortuna et al. 2014). 
Through the synthesis of a large library of 59 derivatives of structurally various 
oxadiazole derivatives, the SAR of 1,2,4-oxadiazoles was investigated to create Oxadiazole as Inhibitors 137 
Figure 3. Oxadiazole derivatives showed potent antibacterial action against MRSA (Verma et al. 2021a). 
a novel class of antibiotics (Ding et al. 2015). Many substances demonstrated the 
necessary action against S. aureus and numerous MRSA strains. According to the 
SAR, an H-bond donor in the oxadiazole’s phenyl ring at position C-5 is necessary 
for antibacterial activity. Pyrazole, aniline, and phenol all effectively inhibit MRSA 
through hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, hydrogen-bond acceptors on the phenyl ring 
at position C-5 of the oxadiazole ring and carboxylic acids slow the antibacterial 
action. Some aliphatic heterocycles (piperidine and piperazine) and heterocyclic 
systems like pyrroles, pyrazoles, and triazoles lose their activity. Considering their 
preparation, the top 100 compounds were selected from the in-silico analyses of 
oxadiazole-based derivatives. When they were all tested against the ESKAPE family 
of bacteria, hit molecule 42 (MIC: 2 mg/mL against S. aureus) was discovered and 
is now the subject of additional research. Macromolecular synthesis experiments 
indicated that PBP2a is inhibited by blocking cell-wall biosynthesis rather than 138 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
replication, transcription, or translation (penicillin-binding proteins). The halogens 
and hydrogen-bond acceptor moieties on the phenyl ring at the C-5 of oxadiazoles 
decrease their activity, as indicated by SAR studies. The in vitro action is enhanced 
by pyrazole ring substitution, but mammalian cells are poisoned. The activity was not 
significantly affected when sulfur and nitrogen atoms were used in place of the ether 
oxygen linker. The investigated substances showed up to 100% oral bioavailability, 
a half-life of up to 40 hours, and were proven to be bactericidal. Animal models for 
neutropenic thigh infection and murine peritonitis/sepsis were used to test the in vivo 
effectiveness of these lead candidates. In linezolid-susceptible strains and animal 
models infected with linezolid-resistant strains, compound 39 had equivalent efficacy 
to linezolid (Verma et al. 2021a). A variety of structurally modified derivatives of 
linezolid with carboxamide side chains and varying numbers of fluorine atoms on 
the phenyl ring at the C-5 on the oxadiazole ring were synthesized using linezolid 
decorated with a 1,2,4-oxadiazole moiety in the place of its isoster oxazolidinone 
ring (Palumbo Piccionello et al. 2012). All of the produced compounds were tested 
against MRSA and other bacterial strains. Sadly, none of the substances were 
effective against MRSA (C530). 
In order to create new and effective antibacterial medicines that can combat 
MRSA, a different series of linezolid-like oxadiazole derivatives has been rationalized 
(Fortuna et al. 2013). The substitution of 1,2,4-oxadiazole for morpholine and the 
insertion of various groups to the side chains of oxazolidinone was responsible for 
the shift in the in vitro antibacterial activity of these novel families of antibiotics. 
Four of the 14 studied compounds demonstrated action against MRSA that was 
comparable to or better than that of linezolid, whereas sulfur-embedded variants 
outperformed regular linezolid in this regard. Linezolid outperformed two acetamide 
analogs against the MRSA strain, presumably due to the racemic mixing state. The 
efficacy of these kinds of substances against MRSA may be significantly enhanced 
by their pure enantiomers. Cell survival tests on the PK15, HaCaT, and HepG2 cell 
lines demonstrated the decreased toxicity of the linezolid-like compound due to the 
impact of the fluorine atom. 
In contrast, 1,2,4-triazole and 1,3-diazole with 5-acetamido methyl groups 
resulted in a complete loss of activity against MRSA, according to the SAR, but 
other heterocycles like triazole, pyridine, and isoxazole substituents were able to 
preserve or augment the activity. The activity is drastically reduced by an eightfold 
increase in their MIC values when the aceto amido methyl substituent is replaced 
with a thio aceto amido methyl group. The effectiveness of the chemical has been 
further supported by modeling results that dock the S-enantiomer in complex 
with S. aureus over linezolid in complex with Deinococcus radiodurans (Verma 
et al. 2021a). The 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives with chromone substitutions were 
synthesized and tested for their in vitro antibacterial efficacy against several bacterial 
strains, including MRSA. All bacterial strains displayed poor activity profiles for 
mono-substituted (-Cl, -Br, eF, and eCH3) and unsubstituted chromones. While the 
activity was marginally improved by the di-substitution of chloro and methyl groups 
on chromone ring 45f, it was still inferior to that of ordinary gentamicin and superior 
to that of erythromycin, ampicillin, and ciprofloxacin (Diwakar et al. 2011). Oxadiazole as Inhibitors 139 
Liu and coworkers have integrated pyrimidine fused oxadiazole derivatives and 
tested their antibacterial effectiveness against several MRSA strains to study the 
biological potential of various heterocycles (Verma et al. 2021a). The SAR indicated 
that bromo-substituted 5H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,5-a]pyrimidine analogs fared better 
against MRSA than the equivalent fluoropyrimidine analogs, indicating that they are 
a promising pharmacophore for anti-MRSA drugs. The chemical 46 g was discovered 
to be more effective in the library, exhibiting superior activity to vancomycin and 
cefepime against MRSA 128 and MRSA 747, as well as three times the activity of 
normal cefepime against the MRSA 42 strain. All of the strains employed in the 
study exhibited more activity when dihalogen substitution was used as a pattern; 
interestingly, all compounds demonstrated stronger potency against Gram-positive 
bacterial strains than Gram-negative bacterial strains (Liu et al. 2018). 
3. Role of Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) Inhibitors in 
Anticancer Therapy 
Commercially available anti-cancerous drugs suffer from drawbacks such as decreased 
effectiveness, drug resistance, unfavorable side effects, and non-selectivity. This has 
generated interest in developing a newer, more potent inhibitor of cancer with fewer 
side effects urgently necessary. Recently, several drugs such as Vorinostat (SAHA), 
Romidepsin (FK-228), Beli nostat (PXD-101), Panobinostat (LBH-589), and 
Chidamide have been licensed by US/Chinese FDA for cancer treatment and several 
are in the queue of clinical trials. Since many years ago, heterocycles oxadiazole and 
their derivatives have been extensively used as inhibitors of cancer cells, which has 
attracted a lot of attention among the research community. Inhibiting various growth 
factors and enzymes, such as histone deacetylase (HDAC), thymidylate synthase 
(TS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK), 
epidermal growth factor (EGF), and others, is a key component of the important 
mechanism of suppressing cancer cells (Matore et al. 2022). Currently, HDAC is 
seen as a possible therapeutic target. Apoptosis, differentiation, cell cycle arrest, 
suppression of DNA repair, up-regulation or reactivation of silent tumor suppressors, 
and down-regulation of growth factors are some of the different pathways that 
HDAC inhibitors control and induce cancer cell death. Hence, oxadiazole and its 
derivatives are widely recognized as novel anticancer drugs because they inhibit 
HDAC enzymes (Matore et al. 2022). 
Recently, tri fluoro acetyl thiophene carboxamides were studied as HDAC 
inhibitors with moderate selectivity for the class II HDAC enzymes. They discovered 
that numerous derivatives exhibited strong activity against HDAC4 after substituting 
various bioisosteric heteroaromatic oxadiazoles and thiazoles for the carboxamide 
moiety. It demonstrated greater selectivity for HDAC1 and HDAC6 by 685 and 
75 times, respectively (Muraglia et al. 2008). HDAC inhibitors with a scaffold 
moiety of 1,2,4-oxadiazole have assessed in vitro anticancer activities. Nine of them 
demonstrated the strongest histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory action, with 
IC50 values that were lower than SAHA, against HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3. 
The structural characteristics were demonstrated using a 3, 5-disubstituted 1, 2, 
4-oxadiazole as the linker moiety. In vitro, anti-proliferation assay results indicated 140 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
compounds were more effective than regular SAHA. The acetylating process is 
greatly upregulated based on western blot assays, and the mechanism of action was 
also disclosed by molecular docking research. The mechanism was investigated by 
a flow-cytometry study, and it operates through apoptosis and produces cell cycle 
arrest (Yang et al. 2019a). As novel 1,3,4 oxadiazole with glycine/alanine hybrids 
as HDAC8 specific inhibitors, the preliminary evaluation study revealed that the 
1,3,4 oxadiazole with alanine hybrid (R)-2-amino-N-((5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2­
yl) methyl) propenamide. Additionally, it demonstrated a dose-dependent impact and 
a drop in the percentage of apoptotic cells and mitochondrial membrane potential, 
as well as lower IC50 values against the MDA-MB231 and MCF7 breast cancer cell 
lines (Pidugu et al. 2017). 
Different pharmacophoric groups can be substituted in the oxadiazole ring 
to create novel compounds with improved anticancer potential. The development 
of Hydrox-mate-based HDAC inhibitors with a 1,2,4-oxadiazole ring moiety was 
investigated. The investigation of the US FDA-approved drug Vorinostat is the basis 
for this study (SAHA). Only the cap group of Vorinostat has had various groups 
substituted and examined for anticancer profiles that were more powerful than 
conventional Vorinostat. SAR generally illustrates changes in compound activity 
brought on by substitutions made to the Vorinostat compound’s fundamental 
structural elements. According to the study, the type of the numerous substituents 
rather than the oxadiazole’s fundamental structure determines its activity. The series 
demonstrates that the 1,3,4-oxa diazole’s fifth position substitute greatly affects its 
anticancer potential. The 1,3,4-oxadiazole ring demonstrates increased inhibitory 
activity as its electronegativity rises. Additionally, Ortho > Meta > Para is the 
order of substitution with increasing activity. The order of substitution for halogens 
was I > Br > Cl > F in the ortho position of the benzene ring, while Br > Cl and 
Br > Cl > I > F were the orders in the meta and para positions, respectively (Yang 
et al. 2019b). Biologically active compounds contain small oxadiazole nuclei showing 
excellent anticancer properties. Several 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives were tested for 
their ability to inhibit various HDAC enzyme types. The most effective and selective 
HDAC1 inhibitor was (E)-N-(2-aminophenyl)-3-(4-(((5-(naphthalene-1-yl methyl)­
1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl) methyl) phenyl) acrylamide (4). Comparatively, to SAHA, it 
prominently inhibited HDAC1. It also exhibits a strong antiproliferative effect against 
the five leukemia cancer cells and its HDAC inhibitory action against HDAC1/4/6. 
The benzamide derivatives were less effective in inhibiting HDAC4/6 than the 
hydroxamic acid derivatives. Whether doxorubicin was used with HDAC inhibitors 
was also studied. It was found that doxorubicin plus HDAC inhibitor combinations 
showed greater cell growth arrest. The combination of HDAC inhibitors with various 
chemotherapeutic medicines (phosphatase inhibitors, GSK3b inhibitors, etc.) has 
demonstrated excellent synergy due to the multi-factorial molecular aspect of cancer 
(Valente et al. 2014). 
A new 2,5-disubstituted 1,3,4-oxadiazoles were synthesized to examine 
their anticancer potential by HDAC inhibitory assay and antiproliferative assay. 
By specifically inhibiting HDAC8, all the evaluated oxadiazole compounds 
demonstrated significant anticancer efficacy. Comparable to the positive control Oxadiazole as Inhibitors 141 
medication Vorinostat, the compound demonstrated significant HDAC8 inhibitory 
action as well as improved anticancer efficacy. Additionally, it demonstrated 
nM-range HDAC1 and HDAC2 inhibitory action, which effectively inhibited the 
growth of MDA MB231 breast cancer cell lines. The most potent hybrid has been 
synthesized by replacing the aromatic phenyl ring at position two and the alanine 
framework at position five of the 1,3,4-oxadiazole scaffold, which eventually inhibits 
cancerous activity (Pidugu et al. 2016). 
Three series of oxadiazole analogs, including hydroxamate, 2-aminobenzamide, 
and trifluoromethyl ketone, were developed, and their MTT-based assay for in vitro 
antiproliferative efficacy was tested. Further, the substances were evaluated against 
HDAC1, 2, and 8 isoforms. The investigations suggest these compounds might be 
promising for developing antitumor medicines with HDAC inhibitory action. The 
majority of the 2-aminobezamide and hydroxamate analogs showed better selectivity 
for HDAC1 than for HDAC2 and HDAC8. Compared to the controls, Vorinostat 
and Entinostat demonstrated the strongest inhibition with lower IC50 values. 
Against all evaluated HDAC enzymes and cancer cell lines, all three of these drugs 
demonstrated strong anticancer activity in the M range. These three compounds 
comprise substituted 1,2,4-oxadiazole, six carbon alkyl chains, and hydroxamic acid 
(ZBG) (CAP). Significant HDAC1 inhibitory activity was seen when 4-nitro phenyl 
(15), thiophene (16), and pyridine (17) were substituted (Cai et al. 2015a). 
A number of dual inhibitors focusing on HDAC6 and Hsp90 had been 
synthesized. In order to find effective HDAC6 and Hsp90 inhibitors, the first choice 
was ZINC and ChEMBL open databases, followed by ADMET screening of the 
entire database and molecular docking. The ten best hits were selected from the 
molecular docking results and used in the experiments. The 1,2,4-oxadiazole ring 
served as the cap structure for all ten potent hits, which was an interesting discovery. 
Various inhibitory tests employing SAHA, Tubastatin (TUB), and 17-AAG were 
used to investigate the inhibitory activity (% inhibition) against HDAC1, HDAC6, 
and Hsp90. According to the HDAC6 inhibitory assay results, seven substances 
H[KLELWPRUHWKDQLQKLELWLRQDWDFRQFHQWUDWLRQRIȝ07KHWZRFRPSRXQGV
appeared to exhibit potent inhibition when these compounds were studied further 
DW D FRQFHQWUDWLRQ RI  ȝ0$ R[DGLD]ROH GHULYDWLYH ZLWK SDUDVXEVWLWXWLRQ
was more effective than one with meta substitution. HDAC1 and Hsp90 have not 
been effectively inhibited by a single substance (Pinzi et al. 2020). By altering 
the CAP structure with a -carboline 1,3,4-oxadiazole hybrid, various new HDAC 
inhibitors have been synthesized. The antitumor activity of the produced compounds 
was assessed utilizing the HDAC inhibitory and MTT tests. Five distinct HDAC 
enzymes—HDAC1, 2, 3, 4, and 8—and the cancer cell line HCT116 were used to 
examine each substance. Compared to normal SAHA, it demonstrated a reduced IC50 
against HDAC1, 2, and 6. Additionally, the MTT assay demonstrated its potency by 
demonstrating maximal inhibition on HCT116 cancer cell lines with a lower IC50 
than typical SAHA. Additionally, docking investigation also demonstrated that high 
binding affinity displayed numerous favorable interactions with certain amino acid 
residues of HDAC protein. The modified CAP structure (-carboline 1,3,4-oxadiazole) 142 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
of 24 demonstrated improved activity and three positive interactions with amino acid 
residues (Tian et al. 2022). 
Using a variety of 2-amino benzamide and hydroxamate derivatives with an 
oxadiazole nucleus, the in vitro anticancer properties were examined using an 
MTT-based assay on the human cell lines U937, A549, NCI-H661, MDA-MB-231, 
and HCT116. The 2-aminobenzamide class of substances exhibited the greatest 
inhibition against the U937 cell line for human acute monocytic myeloid leukemia. 
Additionally, the derivatives were examined for their capacity to inhibit HDAC1, 
2, and 8. Compared to HDAC2 and HDAC8, all 2-Amino benzamide compounds 
demonstrated a better selectivity for HDAC1. Compared to SAHA and entinostat, 
compounds displayed greater potency and lower IC50 values. All compounds 
have the cap structure 1,2,4-oxadiazole; however, they differ in the third position 
replacement. The substitutions comprise 4-nitro phenyl, 2-chloro phenyl, 4-chloro 
phenyl, and 4-fluro phenyl at the third position of the 1,2,4-oxadiazole cap structure. 
Additionally, these substances demonstrated strong anticancer activity against five 
distinct cancer cell lines. In contrast to the compounds in the 2-aminobenzamide 
series, most hydroxamate derivatives selectively inhibit HDAC8 over HDAC1 
and 2 (Cai et al. 2015b). 
Using hydroxamic acid, two novel series of 2-[5-(4-substituted phenyl)-
[1,3,4]-oxadiazol/thiadiazol-2-ylamino]-pyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid (tetrahydro￾pyran-2-yloxy)-amides were synthesized and tested for their histone deacetylase 
inhibitory efficacy. The findings of in vitro anticancer tests’ demonstrated that 
compounds were most effective against HDAC1 and HCT-116. These substances 
have the strongest CAP structures, which are 1,3,4-oxadiazole scaffolds. The second 
position of the oxadiazole underwent various substitutions, whereas the substitution 
at the fifth position was the same in all four compounds (pyrimidine as a linker and 
hydroxamic acid as ZBG). Similar activity against HDAC1 was displayed by the 
compounds which were replaced with aromatic phenyl and 3-chloro phenyl. This 
information revealed that the 1,3,4-oxadiazole’s substituted phenyl ring at position 
two is necessary for activity and that other substitutions at different phenyl ring 
positions can change or modify the HDAC inhibitory activity. These findings can be 
applied to developing new HDAC inhibitors (Rajak et al. 2011). 
4. Conclusion 
Oxadiazole-based hybrids demonstrated great biological significance and have been 
effective as MRSA growth inhibitors and anti-HDAC activity for cancer treatment. 
A novel heterocyclic small-molecule-based MRSA inhibitor, which is supported by 
an array of oxadiazole derivatives to combat MRSA in both in vitro and in vivo 
conditions, is now being heavily researched. Their antibacterial action against MRSA 
displayed various modes of action. Adding different substituents with different 
electronic properties to some aryl/heteroaryl moieties fixed to the parent oxadiazole 
skeleton significantly impacted whether the antibacterial activity against MRSA 
was increased or decreased. On the other hand, angiogenesis, which is controlled 
by HDAC and the release of VEGF, is one of the most significant processes. It is 
ultimately responsible for the development of cancer and metastasis. HDAC, an Oxadiazole as Inhibitors 143 
authentic and potential target enzyme, is widely considered for developing anticancer 
drugs. In order to achieve the appropriate potency, placements of substituents inside 
the oxadiazole moiety with varied pharmacophores are highly important. This 
supported the significance of oxadiazole scaffolds in the development of anticancer 
medications. Researchers across the globe should put more focus on and learn 
the fundamental requirements and critical elements for developing newer HDAC 
inhibitors with minimal adverse effects, as well as MRSA growth inhibitors.

Oxadiazole in Medicine 
and Drug Discovery 
1. Introduction 
Health concerns became the most important clinical issue as they grew daily. For 
effective treatment, medicinal chemists have recently begun searching for novel 
drugs. Numerous heterocyclic drugs are used in clinical studies to treat infectious 
illnesses (Siwach and Verma 2020). Oxadiazoles—heterocyclic compounds with 
five members that contain one oxygen and two nitrogen heteroatoms—are effective 
and efficacious. Oxadiazole has four different structural isomers: 1,2,3, 1,2,4, 1,2,5, 
and 1,3,4 (Figure 1). Due to the inductive effect of the extra heteroatom in the 
structure, they are a weak base and are a crucial component of many commercially 
available drugs for various disease treatments (Desai et al. 2022a). The most popular 
oxadiazole-containing drugs on the market include nesapidil (antihypertensive), 
raltegravir (anti-HIV), furamizole (antibiotic), zibotentan (anticancer), tiodazosin 
(alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist), and oxolamine (cough suppressant). 
They display a wide range of biological activities, including antimicrobial, 
antihypertensive, antimitotic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, or antiproliferative 
effects by hybridizing with either another heterocyclic motif or by adding various 
DON\ORUDU\OVXEVWLWXHQWV/DGDQLHWDO8VWDEDúHWDO'HVDLHWDOE
Oxadiazole is a pharmacophore for hybrid moieties since it forms hydrogen bonds 
with biological receptors (De et al. 2019; Ningegowda et al. 2020). 
Due to the prevalence of oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen rings in pharmacological 
compounds, efforts in medicinal chemistry frequently focus on imitating such 
structural motifs. Numerous natural products, such as nucleic acids, amino acids, 
carbohydrates, vitamins, and alkaloids, comprise heterocycles. Since heterocyclic 
scaffolds make up more than 85% of bioactive chemical compositions, they play 
a significant role in medicine and drug design and are, therefore, frequently found 
in commercially available drugs (Mfuh and Larionov 2015). They have essential 
qualities like electron donor and withdrawer, acceptor, and donor of H bonds, thus 
taking part in interactions with receptors or target molecules (Strzelecka et al. 2022). 
They are equipped with unique properties such as aqueous solubility, polarity, 148 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
Figure 1. Oxadiazole and their different structural isomers. 
lipophilicity, potency through bioisosteric replacements, and selectivity. As a result, 
they play a much more significant role in modern medicinal chemists’ toolkits 
(Meanwell et al. 2011). Different types of heterocycles, such as pyrimidine, furan, 
pyrrole, indole, oxadiazole, benzoxazole, azetidine, thiophene, coumarin, benzofuran, 
pyrazole, quinoline oxazole, quinazoline, pyrimidine, thiazole, quinoline, pyrazole, 
and isoxazole, exhibits strong pharmacological action (Desai et al. 2022a). For 
example, pyridine shows a wide range of properties, such as analgesic, anticancer, 
antimicrobial, antimalarial, antitubercular, anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and 
antiviral effects. 
The heterocyclic compounds isolated from nature shared structural characteristics 
with medicines currently on the market, so minor structural alterations resulted in a 
variety of heterocyclic molecules that can be used to discover new drugs (Petri et al. 
2020; Köprülü et al. 2021). The presence of a variety of functional groups makes them 
primitive structures of pharmaceutically significant scaffolds (Babaev 1993). Lead 
optimization is made possible by heterocycles with various shapes and electronic 
and physicochemical characteristics. However, not all structure-activity relationship 
(SAR) developments result in the desired pharmacological effect. The ability of 
heterocycles to participate in hydrogen bonding with the target protein, where the 
heterocycle can play the role of either H acceptor as in heteroaromatic compounds or 
H donor as in heterocyclic compounds, can be explained by their improved potency 
and specificity. Different five- and six-membered heterocycles are built by switching 
the positions of the aromatic ring’s nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen heteroatoms (Hong 
et al. 2021). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved numerous drugs 
in 2020, including remdesivir (broad-spectrum antiviral drug) (Farag et al. 2020), 
avaprinitib (an antitumor drug) (Rizzo et al. 2021), pematinib (an anticancer drug 
XVHG WR WUHDW FKRODQJLRFDUFLQRPD 6QH\G DQG 5LJE\ဨ-RQHV  UHPLPD]RODP
(sedative drug) (Tan and Habib 2021), and oliceradine (pain medication) (Desai 
et al. 2018), respectively. In 2021, Asciminib-protein kinase inhibitors and 
tivozanib-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors were approved, followed by 
Daridorexant (a medication used to treat insomnia) and Mitapivat (a drug used to 
treat hemolytic anemia), both were given FDA approval in 2022 (Desai et al. 2022b). 
The widespread use of the oxadiazole moiety in medicine has led to its emergence Oxadiazole in Medicine and Drug Discovery 149 
Figure 2. A compilation of FDA approved drugs in recent years (Source: 10.1002/ardp.202200123). 
as a separate class of pharmaceutically active compounds, and its aggregation with 
other heterocyclic scaffolds has produced important bioactive molecules. Figure 2 
shows the list of FDA-approved drugs in the recent past. 
2. Different Types of Conjugates 
2.1 Oxadiazole-Pyridine Conjugate 
The antitubercular activity of pyridine conjugates with 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives 
against MTB H37Ra and M. bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) versus RIF 
and isoniazid as reference drug was evaluated. When MTB H37Ra was in the 
active or dormant states, the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of the 
derivates was found to be in the range of 1.49–3.43 ȝJ/ml. In order to combat 
M. bovis BCG in active and dormant states, compounds showed MICs in the range 
of 3.03–19.74 ȝJ/mL, respectively. Additionally, synthetic compounds have a high 
selectivity index for the human cell line against BCG, which denotes a particular 
antitubercular profile. A high molecular docking score of between 7.13 and 7.18 for 
the oxadiazole clubbed pyridine scaffold in the active site of mycobacterial enoyl 
reductase (InhA) (PDB code: 4TZK) provided essential insights into the binding 
mode and affinity of the hybrid scaffold. The findings suggested that the scaffold 
could successfully engage in several close-bonded and nonbonded interactions 
within the InhA active site (Desai et al. 2018). The triazole and morpholine 
compounds demonstrated excellent antitubercular activity (25 ȝJ/ml) against MTB 
H37Rv. The 1,3,4 oxadiazoles are based on 2 benzyl sulfanyl nicotinic acids and 
have excellent antitubercular activity when tested against MTB H37Rv. These 
compounds have promising antibacterial properties. The antitubercular activity 
of these substances was greater than that of the RIF reference drug. Due to the 
presence of thiazole and benzothiazole units, an excellent antitubercular activity 150 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
Figure 3. Conjugates of oxadiazole and pyridine exhibit potent antitubercular activity against M. bovis 
(Source: 10.1002/ardp.202200123). 
(50–62.5 ȝJ/ml) against MTB H37Rv was determined (Patel et al. 2013). In another 
study, 1,3,4 oxadiazoles based on pyridine exhibit excellent antitubercular activity 
against MTB H37Rv at different concentrations of 0.0077, 0.0052, and 0.0089 ȝ0, 
thereby displaying more than 90% inhibition. Alongside, another derivative of the 
same conjugate demonstrated antibacterial activity against several Gram-positive and 
Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Salmonella Paratyphi, as 
well as gram-positive bacteria like Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, 
respectively (Raval et al. 2014). Oxadiazole-pyridine conjugates with antitubercular 
activity are presented in Figure 3. 
2.2 Oxadiazole-Benzofuran Conjugates 
A series of 5(5-methyl benzofuran-3-ylmethyl)-3H [1,3,4] oxadiazole-2-thione 
derivatives demonstrated powerful antitubercular action against MTB H37Rv and 
Mycobacterium phlei. The compounds with chloro and bromo substitutions on 
benzofuran had outstanding activity against MTB H37Rv and M. phlei, with MIC 
values in the range of 1.56–3.125 ȝJ/ml. The drug’s affinity for the MTB MurE 
ligase has been a significant target for the suppression of TB. The molecular docking 
studies with a docking score of 109.364 and the compounds’ comparable binding 
poses to the co-crystallized ligand provided additional support for PZA (Negalurmath 
et al. 2019). 
 2[DGLD]ROHఆ7KLD]ROH&RQMXJDWHV
Compounds developed by Kumar and co-workers (2010) showed MIC of 4 to 8 ȝJ/ml 
against MTB H37Rv, demonstrating promising antitubercular action. S. aureus, 
S. faecalis, and B. subtilis, as well as fungi like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida 
tropicalis, and Aspergillus niger, were also susceptible to its antimicrobial effects. 
The 1,3,4 oxadiazoles with pyridine bases were developed by Dhumal et al. (2016) 
and tested in vitro for their antitubercular activity against M. bovis BCG and MTB Oxadiazole in Medicine and Drug Discovery 151

ardp.202200123). 
H37Ra. The results indicated excellent MIC values between 2.56 and 5.84 ȝg/ml 
(Figure 4). The antitubercular activity of theoretical prediction and experimental data 
were discovered to be connected by the molecular docking investigation. By assessing 
the degree of affinities to the active site residue, the molecular docking analysis 
of the produced compounds demonstrated that the compounds were successfully 
docked into the active site of mycobacterial enoyl reductase. All the active drugs 
shred similar binding modes in the active site. According to the ligand interaction 
energy distribution, compounds were found to be anchored to the active site of InhA 
through several favorable van der Waals interactions, electrostatic interactions, and 
some stacking interactions. The antitubercular activity of isoxazole clubbed 1,3,4 
oxadiazoles was tested against MTB H37Rv by Shingare and co-workers (Shingare 
et al. 2018). Due to the methoxy group and fluorine atom in the phenyl ring, 
compounds demonstrated good antitubercular action with MIC of 62.5 and 50 ȝJ/ml. 
Due to the existence of two aromatic ring replacements on both the isoxazole and 
oxadiazole rings, the compounds exhibited significant hydrophobic interactions. 
The MurD ligase enzyme was subjected to molecular docking investigations; the 
results showed docking scores of 7.28 and 7.35. In vitro antitubercular activity 
against MTB H37Rv (MTB) and isoniazid-resistant MTB (INHR-MTB) strains 
was evaluated using a series of 1,5-dimethyl-2-phenyl-4-[(5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazol￾2-yl) methyl] amino-1,2-dihydro-3H pyrazolones (Ahsan et al. 2011). The reported 
MIC values of 0.78–6.81 and 8.29 ȝJ/ml were 1.4 times more active than isoniazid. 
The results of the antitubercular activity show that the activity was boosted by the 
presence of electron-withdrawing groups on the phenyl ring or heterocycle linked 
to the oxadiazole ring. In a study, 0.78 and 3.12 ȝJ/ml of 1,5-dimethyl-2-phenyl-4­
[5-(arylamino)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl] methylamino-1,2dihydro-3H-pyrazol-3-ones 
shown potent antitubercular action against MTB and INHR-MTB. Other closely 
related substances, however, had activity levels of 3.12–6.25 and 6.25–12.5 ȝJ/ml 
against MTB and INHR-MTB, which was good to moderate. The N-aryl group joined 
to the oxadiazole ring can be substituted to boost the antitubercular action (Ahsan 
et al. 2012). With MIC values of 7.46 and 15.01 ȝJ/ml, synthetic 4 (substituted 
benzylidene) 3 [(5 (pyridine4-yl) 1,3,4oxadiazole2 ylthio] methyl isoxazol5(4H) 
ones shown strong antitubercular action against MTB H37Ra and M. bovis B. 
Additionally, strong antibacterial activity against Gram-negative strains of E. coli 152 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
and P. flurescence (MIC = 2.93 ȝJ/ml and 7.17 ȝJ/ml) was reported, followed by 
gram-positive bacteria S. aureus (MIC = 6.63 ȝJ/ml) and B. subtilis (MIC = 3.2 ȝJ/ml) 
(Chavan et al. 2019). Marine bromopyrrole alkaloids and 1,3,4-oxadiazole were 
combined using a molecular hybridization method to create hybrids that exhibited 
broad-spectrum antibacterial action against Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus and 
Gram-negative bacteria E. coli. The typical activity ranged from 1.50 to 3.50 ȝJ/ml. 
The functional groups were changed to increase the antitubercular activity further 
(Rane et al. 2012). When used against drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB, a 
series of N-alkyl-5-(pyridin-4-yl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole-2-amines and related derivatives 
demonstrated MIC values of 4–8 ȝ0 (Vosátka et al. 2018). On the other hand, 
employing the BACTEC 460 radiometric system, derivatives of 1,3,4 oxadiazole 
demonstrated greater than 6.25 ȝJ/ml inhibitions against MTB H37Rv in BACTEC 
12B medium (Küçükgüzel et al. 2002). A number of Mannich-based compounds 
were synthesized for in vitro antitubercular activity studies against MTB H37Rv 
and INHR-MTB. The drugs’ MIC values against the two antitubercular strains 
were 0.10–1.10, 0.14–1.14, and 0.42–2.42 ȝ0, demonstrating their excellent 
antitubercular action (Ali and Shaharyar 2007). The synthesis of 5-aryl-2-thio1,3,4 
oxadiazole derivatives and their in vitro antitubercular efficacy against MTB H37Rv 
was reported. At 12.5 ȝJ/ml, the compounds had considerable inhibitory efficacy 
above 70%. Active substances in Rv1155 were molecularly docked, and it was 
discovered that these substances fit well in the active site, which is made up of the 
amino acids Ser144, Arg140, Lys78, Tyr88, Ile74, Leu75, and Leu76. The proteins 
Ser144 and Arg140 are connected by hydrogen bonds created by the oxygen in the 
hydroxyl group. The oxadiazole ring was situated in the cavity between the amino 
acids Leu76 and Leu75, and its nitrogen forms a hydrogen connection with Leu76. 
The backbone acceptor, backbone donor, and side-chain acceptor characteristics of 
amino acids were observed (Macaev et al. 2011).

A group of 1,3,4 oxadiazoles integrating piperazine scaffold were examined for 
their antibacterial, antitubercular, and antioxidant activities. These compounds had 
antitubercular activity against MTB with MIC values between 1.60 and 6.25 ȝJ/ml. 
Three distinct protein targets—isocitratelyase (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
PDB ID: 6g1o), dihydrofolate reductase (S. aureus, PDB ID: 5isp), and noranthrone 
synthase—were the subjects of a docking investigation (Aspergillus parasiticus, 
PDB ID: 5kbz). For in-silico docking simulations of the antitubercular and 
antioxidant activity of the produced compounds, methionine aminopeptidase 
(MTB, PDB ID: 5yxf) and tyrosine-protein kinase (Homo sapiens, PDB ID: 6il3) 
were chosen, and the compounds have shown remarkable promise. The findings 
of docking studies indicated that synthetic molecules had higher binding energies 
to protein targets than conventional medicines. The produced compounds exhibit a 
stronger affinity for the protein target protein tyrosine kinase 2b (PDB ID: 5tob) in 
the series and better binding energy and inhibition constant against the protein target 
enzyme enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (PDB ID: 2nsd) (Bhati et al. 2019). 
As promising antibacterial and antitubercular drugs, 1,3,4 oxadiazole molecules Oxadiazole in Medicine and Drug Discovery 153 
fused with triazolo and tetrazolo groups, and pyrazine was created. The synthesized 
compounds were evaluated for in vitro antitubercular activity against MTB H37Rv, 
using isoniazid and RIF as reference medications. With a MIC of 6.25 to 50 ȝJ/ml, 
the compound demonstrated strong antitubercular action against MTB H37Rv (Das 
et al. 2015). A series of new 1,3,4 oxadiazole-containing quinoline motifs as possible

tested for MTB H37Rv resistance using RIF and isoniazid as reference medicines. 
At a 250 ȝJ/ml dosage, four compounds were determined to be the most effective 
in the main screening, inhibiting MTB H37Rv by more than 90%. The MIC values 
of the active hybrids ranged from 0.060 to 0.223 mM (Ladani et al. 2015). As 
possible antitubercular drugs, pyrazine containing 1,3,4 oxadiazoles synthesized 
and combined with substituted azetidin-2-ones. The synthesized compounds 
were tested for in vitro antitubercular activity against MTB H37Rv using the 
/RZHQVWHLQ-HQVHQ DJDU PHWKRG DQG LVRQLD]LG DQG 5,) ZHUH XVHG DV UHIHUHQFH
medications. With a MIC value of 3.12 g/ml, the synthesized compounds were 
discovered to be the most effective against MTB H37Rv. The antitubercular 
potential of the compound was moderate (MIC = 6.25 g/ml). High docking scores 
for compounds were in the range of 69.449 and 64.705 (Das and Mehta 2015). Novel 
pyrazole-oxadiazole hybrids were synthesized as possible antitubercular drugs, 
exhibiting MICs of 0.92–2.56 ȝJ/ml against MTB H37Ra in the active state. With 
MICs between 0.79 and 2.71 ȝJ/ml, compounds showed substantial efficacy against 
M. bovis BCG in the active form. The compounds were successfully docked into the 
active site of mycobacterial enoyl reductase, according to docking studies (InhA), 
with a binding energy of 66.459 kcal/mol and a docking score of 10.366 (Desai 
et al. 2022a). Desai and co-workers synthesized furan and pyridine-based oxadiazole 
hybrids as possible antitubercular drugs. When tested against MTB H37Ra and 
M. bovis BCG, it showed outstanding antitubercular activity within the range of 
97.09 to 98.66% inhibition at a concentration of 30 ȝJ/ml. The molecules were 
successfully docked into the active site of mycobacterial enoyl reductase, according 
to a docking study (InhA), with a binding energy of 49.893 kcal/mol and a docking 
score of 8.991, respectively (Desai et al. 2022a).

Benzoimidazole Conjugates 
Researchers are interested in studying the synthesis and pharmacological properties 
of pyridine heterocycles because of their biological significance and pharmacological 
and medical potential. Pyridine has a wide range of biological effects, including 
anticancer, antimicrobial, anticonvulsant (Prasanthi et al. 2014), antibacterial

et al. 2015) properties. The nitrogen heterocycle with the pyridine moiety is 
most likely found throughout nature. Tryptophan, an amino acid, and serotonin, 
a neurotransmitter, both contain indole moiety as a necessary component. Indole 
scaffolds display biological activities which are demonstrated by compounds with 
a 1,3,4-oxadiazole ring (Desai et al. 2018). By using the XTT reduction menadione 
assay and the nitrate reductase assay, the indole and pyridine-based 1,3,4 oxadiazole 154 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
compounds against M. bovis BCG and MTB H37Ra have been developed and 
tested for their in vitro antitubercular efficacy. RIF and isoniazid were considered 
as controls. In vitro tests of different synthetic compounds against M. bovis BCG 
in both active and dormant states showed potent antitubercular activity. In contrast, 
other compounds were shown to have excellent antitubercular activity against 
M. bovis BCG in both the active (0.94–5.17 ȝJ/ml) and dormant states 
(0.85–4.97 ȝJ/ml), respectively. Many other compounds were subjected to a 
molecular docking study against mycobacterial enoyl reductase (PDB code: 4TZK), 
which revealed information about the thermodynamic interactions and binding mode 
with the highest GLIDE docking score, which ranged from 8.07 to 8.267 (Desai 
et al. 2016). In order to test for in vitro antitubercular activity against MTB H37Rv, 
the benzimidazolyl 1,3,4-oxadiazol 2ylthio-Nphenyl (benzothiazolyl) acetamides

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), a deadly pathogen that kills more people than 
any other microbial species, is the cause of tuberculosis (TB). This was first discovered 
by Robert Koch in 1882. It is the second-leading cause of death, behind COVID-19 
(behind HIV/AIDS) (WHO Report 2024). Other microbial species related to MTB, 
such as Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium africanum, can also cause TB 
(Beena and Rawat 2013). About 75% of active TB cases are pulmonary TB, while 
the remaining cases are extrapulmonary TB, in which the bacteria affect the bones, 
pleura, joints, and lymphatic system (Rivers and Mancera 2008). The World Health 
Organization (WHO) estimates that 1.5 million people will die worldwide from 
tuberculosis (TB) in 2020. In the same year, there were 10.0 million new cases of TB 
worldwide (WHO Report 2021). The first antitubercular drug to be discovered was 
streptomycin, and its first extensive clinical trial was carried out in 1948, followed by 
thioacetazone and para-aminosalicylic acid as the potential antitubercular drugs (A 
Medical Research Council Investigation 1950; Keshavjee and Farmer 2012). High 
curability rates and decreased susceptibility to antibiotic resistance were produced 
by combining the two medications (Crofton and Mitchison 1948). However, the 
widespread emergence of streptomycin drug resistance fueled the creation, research, 
and development of fresh anti-TB medications (Azevedo and Robinson 2015). These 
include cycloserine, ethionamide, PZA, rifampicin (RIF), ethambutol, and isonicotinic 
acid (isoniazid INH). Even though TB is treatable, it still has a high mortality rate 
and is the most contagious illness in the world. Inadequate case detection remains a 
significant issue for TB infection control despite the development and expansion of 
directly observed treatment, short-course programs, and the increased success rate of  
Oxadiazole in Medicine and Drug Discovery 155 
therapy (Keshavjee and Farmer 2012). Due to the emergence of drug-resistant strains, 
TB has now become a serious issue. Drug-resistant strains led to the development of 
both extensive drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). 
While XDR-TB is resistant to any antibiotic, including capreomycin, kanamycin, and 
amikacin, MDR-TB is resistant to isoniazid and RIF (Caminero and Sotgiu 2010). 
It is urgently necessary to create hybrid molecules by fusing two or more bioactive 
heterocyclic moieties into a single molecular scaffold to combat the issue of MDR 
and TDR TB. To create new hybrids with antitubercular properties, the compounds 
II, 2 heptadecyl 5 (pyridine 4 yl)1,3,4 oxadiazole, and I, 2 pentadecyl 5 (pyridine 
4 yl)1,3,4 oxadiazole, were chosen as two active hybrids against M. bovis. These 
hybrids have antitubercular properties against M. bovis with respective minimum 
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.35 and 0.65 ȝ01DYDUUHWHဨ9i]TXH] HW DO
2007). The emergence of strains that are both multi- and totally drug-resistant has 
made it necessary to look for more potent molecules to combat microbial species like 
MTB, which is both multi- and totally drug-resistant.

Each year, more than 229 million malaria cases are discovered (WHO Report 2021). 
More than one hundred countries still experience malaria, which is still a serious 
health concern in Africa and Asia (Wilkerson et al. 2021). The parasites that caused 
malaria developed asexually in the host and were spread by female anopheles 
mosquitoes (Cowman et al. 2016). Plasmodium falciparum, along with Plasmodium 
falciparum, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and 
Plasmodium knowlesi is the most dangerous species among all the parasites that 
cause malaria in humans. 
The pyrazole acrylic acid-based oxadiazole derivatives were synthesized, 
which showed in vitro antimalarial activity using a culture of the P. falciparum 
chloroquine-sensitive strain. To the chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant 
strains of P. falciparum, the compound showed between 0.245 and 0.724 ȝJ/ml. 
According to molecular docking studies, compounds had docking scores of 5.309 to 
6.844, respectively (Verma et al. 2018). Verma and co-workers prepared and tested 
a series of pyrazole-clubbed oxadiazoles for antimalarial activity. The antimalarial 
screening results against P. falciparum, which is sensitive to chloroquine, indicated 
the potential for the antimalarial agents with a value of 0.886, 0.248, 0.647, 0.322, 
0.582, and 0.494 ȝJ/ml. The catalytic domain of falcipain was shown to interact 
through hydrogen bonding in the molecular docking study, which resulted in a 
docking score of 5.532 (Verma et al. 2019). Novel 1,3,4-oxadiazole analogs were 
synthesized, showing that antibacterial and antimalarial activities in vitro are quite 
effective against P. falciparum pathogen. Both pyrimethamine and chloroquine were 
used as common medications. The potential as a DHFR inhibitor with a binding 
energy of 7.20 kcal/mol was disclosed by a molecular docking analysis against 
P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase, which revealed contact with the active 
site (amino acids) of the receptor (Thakkar et al. 2017). The crystal structure, 
density functional theory, quantum theory of atoms in molecules, and hybrid 
quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics binding energy analysis were studied 156 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
(Al-Wahaibi et al. 2019) to investigate the potential antimalarial lead candidate 
2(4-fluorobenzylthio)5-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)1,3,4-oxadiazole 95. By blocking the 
DHFR target with a Glide XP score of less than 5.4 kcal/mol, the molecule may be 
a viable antimalarial lead candidate, according to the in-silico analysis of PfDHFR.

The body’s complicated biochemical response to irritants, infections, damaged 
cells, and other stimuli is inflammation. Inflammation can be acute or persistent. 
Numerous illnesses, including hay fever, periodontal disease, atherosclerosis, 
and osteoarthritis, are linked to chronic inflammation. The manufacture of 
pro-inflammatory prostaglandins from arachidonic acid results in inflammation 
(Smith et al. 1998; Warner et al. 1999). Biosynthesis involves the cyclooxygenase 
(COX) enzyme; prostaglandins are produced into pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, 
which are then released into tissues to cause inflammation. Cyclooxygenase 1 
(COX1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) are the two isoforms of the COX enzyme. 
The overproduction of prostaglandins during inflammation is caused by COX-2 
(Srivastava et al. 2003). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) relieve 
pain, fever, and inflammation when used in greater quantities, they also prevent 
blood clots (Palomer et al. 2002; Merry et al. 2010). Depending on the medication, 
side effects can include an increased risk of stomach ulcers and bleeding, heart attack, 
and kidney disease. Derivatives of oxadiazole have intriguing pharmacological 
characteristics exhibiting strong anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. 
In another study, the compounds with strong anti-inflammatory and antitumor 
action were synthesized. With ortho, meta, and para substituents in the phenyl ring, 
a significant reduction in edema was observed, with respective edema inhibition 
rates of 55%, 67%, and 67% was observed that were very close to those of aspirin 
(68%) and ibuprofen (73%) (Bezerra et al. 2005). Compounds synthesized by 
Omar and co-workers (Omar et al. 1996) exhibit strong anti-inflammatory effects 
on histamine-induced abdominal edema in rats. These compounds had superior 
anti-inflammatory effectiveness compared to ibuprofen. Based on a 200 mg/kg dose 
of ibuprofen and mean time (minute standard error), anti-inflammatory actions were 
considered. Ibuprofen’s mean time was 6.33 ± 0.96 min, while compounds 99–103’s 
mean time ranged from 6.91 ± 0.88 to 14.56 ± 0.29 min. The 3-aryl 5-propyl 1, 2, 4 
oxadiazole derivatives were synthesized (Srivastava et al. 2003) and evaluated for the 
development of new NSAIDs that could specifically inhibit the COX2 enzyme, which 
oversees producing prostaglandins and other mediators linked to the inflammatory 
process. Using aspirin as a reference medication, the synthesized compounds were 
tested for their anti-inflammatory efficacy. These substances demonstrated strong 
anti-inflammatory efficacy, with edema inhibition ranging from 9.73% to 26.57%. 
Bhandari and co-workers (2008) reported a series of S-substituted phenacyl-1,3,4­
oxadiazole-2-thiol derivatives, which demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory 
activity with percent inhibition values ranging between 71.05% to 74.23% when 
compared to the reference drug diclofenac (percent inhibition = 71.3%) additionally; 
these substances had potent analgesic properties. Fenbufen-based 3[5 (substituted 
aryl)1,3,4oxadiazol2yl]1(biphenyl4yl) propan1ones were claimed to have been Oxadiazole in Medicine and Drug Discovery 157 
synthesized and tested for their analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. These 
substances demonstrated considerable anti-inflammatory efficacy, inhibiting edema 
by more than 55% (Husain et al. 2009). Data on the in vitro inhibition of COX 
enzymes revealed that substances were more selective for COX2 than COX1. The 
selectivity indices with 4 methoxy and 3, 4 dimethoxy substitutions were 29.9 and 
36.1 for COX2, respectively, and their IC50 values were 1.5 and 1.8 M. In one study, 
schiff bases of 1,3,4 oxadiazoles associated quinazolin-4-one with analgesic and 
anti-inflammatory activities are the best candidate (Dewangan et al. 2017). 
With 47.84% and 42.33% inhibition, compounds demonstrated more powerful 
anti-inflammatory action. The development of 1,3,4 oxadiazole-modified 
benzothiazole derivatives as promising anti-inflammatory and antioxidant 
compounds is also well documented. Indomethacin served as the reference 
medication for the in vivo para xylene-induced mice ear edema model, which was 
used to assess the anti-inflammatory effect. At 100 mg/kg, the compound exhibited 
strong anti-inflammatory action with 57.35% inhibition with IC50 values from 0.01 
to 0.05 mmol/L, showing strong antioxidant activity (Zheng et al. 2020). Ascorbic 
acid and diclofenac sodium were used as reference medications for the evaluation 
of a novel series of 2,5-disubstituted 1,3,4 oxadiazole derivatives for their in vitro 
anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. A molecular docking analysis revealed that 
certain substances might fit snugly inside the COX2 enzyme’s active site cavity. The 
docking score of the compound was 8.063, and its glide energy was 33.293 kcal/mol 
(Kashid et al. 2020). By using the Griess assay, 3,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazole 
derivatives has been developed as prospective iNOS inhibitors and anti-inflammatory 
drugs, using indomethacin as the reference medication. In the carrageenan-induced 
paw edema test, compounds significantly reduced the generation of nitric oxide with

Humans can easily contract the spreadable retrovirus, which is a causative agent 
of AIDS, when an infected person’s immune system gradually fails (Hijikata et al. 
1998; Baptista et al. 2010). The HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses are the two varieties out 
of which HIV-1 spreads more quickly than HIV-2 (Gilbert et al. 2003). The primary 
cause of HIV infections worldwide is HIV 1. Initial testing is carried out using 
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to identify HIV-1 antibodies (ELISA). 
Specimens that tested negative for HIV in the initial ELISA are thought to be 
HIV-negative. It was discovered that certain oxadiazole hybrids had anti-HIV efficacy. 
Novel 4 aryl 1, 2, 5 oxadiazole-3 yl carbamate compounds having potential anti-HIV 
action were synthesized (Takayama et al. 1996). The synthesis of 5-(1-adamantyl)­
1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thiones and 5-(1-adamantyl)-3-substituted aminomethyl-1,3,4­
oxadiazoline-2-thiones from 5-(1-adamantyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazoline-2-thione has been 
synthesized. These compounds inhibited HIV-1 replication in MT Against HIV-1 at 
2 ȝ0, the compounds showed moderate anti-HIV activity with more than 10% viral 
replication (El-Emam et al. 2004). The synthesis of quinolone-based oxadiazoles 158 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
and screening for their anti-HIV efficacy were reported. Drugs like azidothymidine 
were commonly utilized. The highest therapeutic indices (TI) values against the 
HIV-1VB59 and HIV-1UG070 strains were demonstrated. Instead of ortho and meta 
positions, electron-donating compounds like methyl and methoxy groups on the para 
position of the phenyl ring improved activity (Shah et al. 2018). In order to create 
anti-HIV-1 drugs, 1,3,4 oxadiazole-substituted 4-oxo[1,2a] pyrimidine conjugates 
were synthesized. The anti-HIV activity of compounds was inhibited by 18%, 26%, 
and 29%, respectively. Drugs like azidothymidine were commonly utilized. The 
activity was boosted more by substitutions in the para position of the phenyl ring 
than in the ortho or meta position (Hajimahdi et al. 2013).

Overusing drugs has increased antimicrobial and antibiotic resistance against 
different bacterial and fungal species (Aminov et al. 2017). Multidrug resistance 
(MDR) has also contributed to a worrying situation globally (Brown and Wright 
2016). Resistance to treatments has increased over the past few decades, necessitating 
the creation of novel hybrids that exhibit a wide range of antimicrobial properties. In 
keeping with this, oxadiazoles will be crucial in creating novel antimicrobial drugs. 
A new series of thiazole clubbed 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives were synthesized, 
and their in vitro antibacterial properties were tested. The antibacterial properties 
of compounds ranged from excellent to good. The substances worked well against 
S. aureus, having corresponding MICs of 500 and 12.5 ȝJ/ml. E. coli was susceptible 
to compounds with corresponding MICs of 50 and 12.5 ȝJ/ml. Some compounds 
had a 25 ȝJ/ml MIC and were effective against Candida albicans (Desai et al. 
2013). A series of 3’-acetyl-2’-aryl-5[3’-(6-methylpyridinyl)] compounds like 
2,3-dihydro [1,3,4] oxadiazole and 3’-acetyl[2,2’-aryl[3,6-methylpyridinyl]-5’­
oxadiazole were synthesized. Evaluation of the antibacterial effects of 2,3-dihydro 
[1,3,4] oxadiazoles on S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Aspergillus flavus, 
Chrysosporium keratinophilum, and Candida albicans was tested. At 1 and 0.5 mg/ml 
concentrations, compounds exhibit the largest zones of inhibition of 9–13 and 
10–13 mm, respectively, demonstrating outstanding antibacterial activity against 
S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa. The investigated bacterial strains were 
effectively inhibited by compounds that showed potent antibacterial properties 
(Shyma et al. 2013). Compared to the common medication fluconazole, compounds 
showed superior antifungal efficacy against A. flavus and C. keratinophilum. 
These chemicals inhibited the enzyme L-glutamine: D-fructose-6-phosphate 
amidotransferase and successfully docked into the active pocket of GlcN6P 
(D-fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase). Compared to typical medications, 
compounds exhibit lower binding energies toward the target, measuring 3.71, 4.89,

for antibacterial activity against strains of bacteria from S. aureus, E. coli, and 
B. subtilis, as well as for antifungal activity against A. niger, A. flavus, and C. albicans. 
Compounds against the tested strains showed significant biological activity. As Oxadiazole in Medicine and Drug Discovery 159

5 substituted (1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl) quinoline derivatives were synthesized 
(Salahuddin et al. 2015). Since different Gram-positive strains of Bacillus cereus 
were suppressed at relatively low concentrations of the produced compounds, their in 
vitro antibacterial activity was examined. The derivatives were most effective against 
Klebsiella pneumonia and against B. cereus as pure ciprofloxacin. Additionally, it 
was discovered that their presence significantly reduced the pathogenicity of many 
Gram-negative bacteria that were multidrug-resistant, such as Proteus vulgarisAP169, 
Vibro cholera 765, and E. coli 35B. The MIC of the highly active compounds against 
the tested species was 12.5 ȝJ/ml. As possible antibacterial agents, heterocyclic 
compounds, including pyrimidine and oxadiazole, were effective against S. aureus 
and E. coli, with MIC values of 50 ȝJ/ml and 12.5 ȝJ/ml, respectively. With a MIC 
value of 50 ȝJ/ml, compounds showed good efficacy against S. aureus. With MICs of 
100, 50, and 100 ȝJ/ml, respectively, compounds demonstrated promising antifungal 
efficacy against C. albicans, A. niger, and Aspergillus clavatus. The results of the 
docking investigation showed that the compounds were successfully docked into the 
active site of DNA gyrase (PDB ID: 1KZN) (Desai et al. 2022a). Novel quinoline-fused 
oxadiazoles showed excellent antibacterial activity with a MIC value of 
25–50 ȝJ/ml against E. coli. According to the docking investigation, the chemicals 
were successfully docked into DNA gyrase’s active site (PDB ID: 1KZN) (Salahuddin 
et al. 2015). As possible antibacterial drugs, quinazoline clubbed thiazole and 
1,3,4-oxadiazole heterocycles found to be effective against E. coli and S. aureus 
with MIC values of 100, 62.5, and 50 ȝJ/ml respectively. The substances were 
successfully docked into the active site of DNA gyrase, according to a molecular 
docking analysis (PDB ID: 1KZN) (Desai et al. 2021). As Staphylococcal biofilm 
inhibitors, 1,2,4-oxadiazole indole analogs were synthesized, which prevented the 
growth of S. aureus ATCC 25923 biofilm and was found to be the most effective. 
Their respective BIC50 values were 9.7, 0.7, and 2.2 ȝM (Parrino et al. 2021).

According to the WHO, Cancer causes 10 million deaths worldwide, and the 
top cause of death for both men and women is lung cancer (WHO Report 2020). 
Chemotherapy can be used to treat cancer when it is first discovered. The success 
of the treatment depends on receiving timely care, such as a surgical procedure 
combined with medicines and radiotherapy (Arruebo et al. 2011; Roy and Saikia 
2016). When a cell’s functioning is out of balance, the cell’s gene transcription 
program results in cell death (Zhao et al. 2022; Siegel et al. 2022). As a result, the 
body’s cells proliferate out of control and spread throughout the entire body. With 
over a hundred different forms, cancer is a major cause of death in both industrialized 
and developing nations (Miller et al. 2022). 160 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry 
The present treatment strategies are helpful, but the link between MDR and the 
toxicity of anticancer drugs has made it necessary to develop new chemotherapeutic 
drugs. It has been noticed that several 1,3,4-oxadiazole-containing compounds will 
be exploited as anticancer medicines in the future based on their pharmacological 
action. The issues with toxicity and MDR may be solved through the creation of 
new chemotherapeutic drugs. 1,3,4-oxadiazole compounds have been reported as 
tubulin inhibitors and possible cytotoxic agents. With GI values of 71.56% (growth 
percentage (GP—28.44%) and 72.68% (GP—27.32%)), the synthesized analogs 
have the highest levels of cytotoxicity among them at 10 ȝ0. This is a higher 
value in a single-dose assay than the common medications gefitinib and imatinib. 
With percent GIs of 102.71%, 95.44%, 92.75%, 92.29%, 91.81%, 89.59%, and 
89.20%, the compound was extremely active against MDA-MB-468 (breast cancer), 
HL-60(TB) (leukemia), NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung cancer), LOXIMVI, 
UACC-62 (melanoma), SR (leukemia), and M14 (melanoma) cell lines (Ahsan et al. 
2018). With percent GIs of 136.36%, 133.09%, 132.40%, 170.76%, 156.66%, and 
141.96%, the compound was found to be highly active against UO-31 (renal cancer), 
OVCAR-4 (ovarian cancer), HOP-92 (non-small cell lung cancer), 786-O (renal 
cancer), RXF 393 (renal cancer), and SNB-75 (CNS cancer). Out of 55 cancer cell 
lines, the compound was shown to be effective against 22–35. In common cell lines, 
compounds show greater cytotoxicity than the established medications gefitinib and 
imatinib. With GI50 values ranging from 1.61 to > 100 ȝ0, the compound shows 
considerable cytotoxicity against the cancer cell types under investigation. With 
respect to the tested cell line SNB75, the compound had the highest GI50 value 
(1.61 ȝ0). The TGI and LC50 values were respectively 3.36 and > 100 ȝ0. The

interaction with Arg841 was observed. A series of benzimidazole-linked oxadiazole 
compounds were tested for anticancer efficacy. By having IC50 values that were like 
the common medication gefitinib (0.081 and 0.098 ȝ0, respectively), compounds 
showed improved binding affinity to the EGFR. With IC50 values of 5.0 and 2.55 
ȝ0, the compounds were more cytotoxic than 5 fluorouracil against the MCF￾7 cancer cell line. The interaction between N1 and Asp831 was demonstrated by 
molecular docking studies. Due to the same hydrogen bond between Asp831 and N1 
of the benzimidazole in both molecules, their binding modes are comparable (Akhtar 
et al. 2017). Several imidazopyrimidinyl-1,3,4 oxadiazole hybrids were produced Oxadiazole in Medicine and Drug Discovery 161 
and tested against various cancer cell lines, which showed strong anticancer activity 
with a mean GP of 33.54. At a single dose of 10 ȝ0, it has strong cytotoxic action 
against most tumor cell lines, with a GI50 value of 1.30–5.46 ȝ0. Additional testing 
at five different dose levels (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 M) revealed GI50 values 
between 1.30 and 5.64 ȝ0 against the examined cancer cell lines. At a single dose of 
10 ȝ0, the compound had the strongest activity against HOP-62 (non-small cell lung 
cancer), with a GP of 65.54% to 72.94% (Subba Rao et al. 2016). 
Furthermore, a Topo II-mediated DNA relaxation experiment shows that 
the same substance can decrease Topo II activity. As demonstrated by molecular 
modeling and the docking score of 8.29, the Topoisomerase enzyme is bound to it. 
In a series of novel 5pyridyl1,3,4oxadiazole derivatives, the anticancer and cytotoxic 
activity was investigated (Khalil et al. 2015). The 2 (benzylsulphanyl)-5aryl￾1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives had EGFR inhibitory action, and the cytotoxic effect 
of 5(pyridyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazolethiol derivatives against the MCF-7 breast cancer

showed in vitro anticancer efficacy against 60 cancer cell lines with a mean GP of 
72.85–74.09 against the cancer cell lines under study. The compounds were very 
active with growth percent of 32.73 and 47.56 for MDA-MB-468 (breast cancer), 
SK-MEL28 (melanoma), NCI-H522 (non-small cell lung cancer), and UO-31 (renal 
cancer) (Salahuddin et al. 2014b). Several novel 2,5 disubstituted 1,3,4 oxadiazole 
derivatives were synthesized, demonstrating a sizable amount of DNA photocleavage 
activity. According to the current study, oxadiazole derivatives had greater potential 
for DNA photocleavage than isonicotinoyl hydrazones, and some changes to the 
basic structure could eventually lead to the development of some chemotherapeutic 
drugs (Kumar et al. 2015). Furthermore, 1,3,4-oxadiazole compounds were tested 
for their anticancer and cytotoxic properties which exhibited strong in vitro 
anticancer properties and cytotoxic activity. The percentage viability IC50 against 
hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 was 21.2 and 12.4 ȝJ/ml, respectively. Compound 
derivatives showed moderate anticancer activity against breast cancer MCF7 with a 
percentage inhibition range of 26–50 ȝJPO%RQGRFNHWDO1ဨEHQ]\Oဨဨဨ162 Oxadiazole in Material and Medicinal Chemistry

phosphorane and carboxylic acid were synthesized (Ramazani et al. 2014). Using 
an MTT assay, the anticancer effects of compounds were evaluated against several 
cancer cell lines. In comparison to the conventional medication doxorubicin, these 
substances demonstrated equivalent or superior cytotoxic activity against the A549, 
HT29, and HT1080 cells with IC50 values of 27.5, 20, 25.7, 13.3, 18, 25.1, 17.3, 
20, and 45.3 ȝ0, respectively. With IC50 values of 13.9 and 4.3 ȝ0, the compound 
demonstrated superior cytotoxic action against the MCF-7 cancer cell line compared 
to doxorubicin, which was four times as strong as doxorubicin, a commonly used 
drug (Desai et al. 2022a). 
By using intercalation binding of 1-substituted phenyl 3-(2-oxo-1,3,4-oxadiazol￾5-yl)-carbolines, the anticancer efficacy and ctDNA were investigated. With a 
GI50 in the range of 0.67–3.20 ȝ0 against five cancer cell lines—breast (MCF7), 
resistant ovarian (NCIADR/RES), lung (NCIH460), ovarian (OVCAR03), and 
colon (HT29) cancer cell lines—a compound with an N, N dimethylaminophenyl 
group demonstrated the best efficacy with the measured mean of GI50 was 1.68 ȝ0
(Savariz et al. 2014). In another study, a new variety of 5H-dibenzo [b,e] azepine￾6,11-dione derivatives with 1,3,4-oxadiazole units as possible anticancer drugs 
for human ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR-3) has been produced. Using the 
MTT assay and rucaparib as a reference medication, the investigated compounds 
were evaluated against the OVCAR-3 cell line. The most effective compounds 
against OVCAR-3 were compound 205 and compound 206, with IC50 values of 
DQGȝ0UHVSHFWLYHO\7KHVWURQJHVWPROHFXOHZDVGRFNHG
into the PARP-1 active site (PDB ID: 4RV6). Rucaparib’s position score was slightly 
higher than the GBVI/WSA binding free energy of 206 in the S field, which was 
13.4189 kcal/mol (He et al. 2018). As possible anticancer medicines, 1,3,4-oxadiazole 
fused tetrazole amide derivatives have been synthesized. Using the MTT assay and 
the standard medication doxorubicin, the antitumor efficacy of the compounds 
was evaluated using three distinct human cancer cell lines A549, MDA-MB-231, 
and MCF7. Compared to doxorubicin, compounds have the highest potency. With 
IC50 values of 1.77, 2.45, and 1.22 ȝ0 for the A549, MDA-MB-231, and MCF￾7 cell lines, the compound exhibited strong anticancer activity. With IC50 values 
of 1.02, 1.34, and 0.31 M for the A549, MDA-MB-231, and MCF7 cell lines, the 
compound exhibited strong anticancer activity. The compound showed promising 
anticancer activity with IC50 values of 1.11, 2.90, and 1.90 ȝ0 against the A549, 
MDA-MB-231, and MCF7 cell lines (Kotla et al. 2020). Also, 2(N-heterocycle) 
substituted 1,3,4 oxadiazoles were synthesized as possible anticancer drugs. Using 
the MTT assay and standard medications doxorubicin and 5 fluorouracil, the 
synthesized compounds were tested for their anticancer efficacy against the three 
distinct human cancer cell lines MCF7, HT-29, and HepG2. With IC50 values of 
DQGȝ0DJDLQVWWKH0&)+7DQG+HS*
cell lines, the compound demonstrated substantial anticancer activity. The compound 
had IC50 values of 0.86 ± 0.47, 0.78 ± 0.19, and 0.26 ± 0.15 against the MCF-7, Oxadiazole in Medicine and Drug Discovery 163 
HT-29, and HepG2 cell lines. With a binding energy of about 10.9 kcal/mol, the 
compound was successfully docked into the active site of colon cancer target protein

were synthesized and demonstrated to have cytotoxic effects on pancreatic cancer 
cells. With IC50 values against Hs766T, PDAC3, HPAF-II, and PATU-T cells 
ranging from 5.7 to 10.7 μM, the compound was found to be the most effective. 
Gemcitabine was a commonly prescribed medication. With a docking score of 6.999 
kcal/mol, molecular docking demonstrated the potential to connect to the active site 
of CDK1 (PDB ID: 4YC6) (Pecoraro et al. 2021). In order to develop new topsentin 
analogs with a 1,2,4-oxadiazole moiety as possible antiproliferative agents against a 
panel of (NCI-60) cell lines, a new series of compounds were synthesized standard 
medications like gemcitabine and 5 fluorouracil were utilized. With an EC50 value 
of 0.40 ȝ0, the compound exhibited strong anticancer activity against SUIT2 cells. 
The EC50 values for the compound against Panc1 and Capan1 cells were 0.8 and 
1.2 ȝ0. With EC50 values of 3.2, 1.6, and 1.3 ȝ0 against SUIT2, Panc1, and 
Capan1 cells, the compound demonstrated antiproliferative efficacy (Carbone et al. 
2021). With EC50 values of 2.8 ȝ0, the compound was found to be more effective 
against Panc1 and Capan1 cancer cell lines. The EC50 values for compound against 
SUIT2, Panc1, and Capan1 cells were in the range of 2.6 to 6.8 ȝ0. Compounds 
with EC50 values of 1.5, 1.4, and 1.9 M against Panc1, Capan1, and SUIT2 cells, had 
equivalent antiproliferative efficacy. The capacity to interact with the ATP-binding 
sites of GSK-3 was shown by molecular docking (PDB ID: 1UV5). 
4. Conclusion and Prospects 
The chapter discussed the importance of hybrid heterocyclic compounds bearing 
oxadiazole moiety and an understanding of their biological targets, showing 
promising antibacterial, anti-HIV, antitubercular, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and 
antimalarial activity. Oxadiazole-containing scaffolds would significantly contribute 
to the reduction of worldwide mortality from MDR-TB, XDR-TB, and MDR-TB 
due to significant therapeutic effects. The 1,2,4-, 1,2,5-, and 1,3,4-oxadiazoles and 
their derivatives appear to provide a viable foundation for therapeutic development. 
The oxadiazole-based scaffold was found to be promiscuous by molecular docking 
against a variety of therapeutically important sites and may be exploited to create 
novel chemotherapeutic drugs in the future. Future development of several new 
therapeutic candidates, including highly promising derivatives, may be facilitated by 
the synthetic approach. This will lead to the development of innovative drug design 
and discovery programs based on oxadiazoles to combat deadly diseases.
