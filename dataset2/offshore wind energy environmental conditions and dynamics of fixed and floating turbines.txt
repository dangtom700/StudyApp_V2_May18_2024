OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY
Many countries have plans to expand wind energy to meet CO2 emissions targets.
Lack of available land area and the need for good and stable wind conditions have
stimulated the development of offshore wind generation technology, which allows
for the development of larger turbines. The offshore environment, however,
involves new challenges related to the design, installation, operation and
maintenance of the turbines.
Based on graduate-level courses taught by the author, this book focuses on the
opportunities and challenges related to offshore wind turbines. It introduces
the offshore environment, including wind and wave dynamics, before discussing
the aerodynamics of wind turbines, hydrodynamic loading, marine operations and
wind farm layout. Featuring examples that demonstrate practical application of
the topics covered and exercises to consolidate student understanding, this is an
indispensable reference text for advanced students and researchers of environmental
science and engineering and for industry professionals working in the wind energy
sector.

The inspiration to write this book came from the recent focus on offshore wind
energy as part of the solution to convert the global energy supply from fossil fuel to
renewables. Several important actors, e.g., the International Energy Agency, have
pointed toward the potential large contribution from offshore wind energy in the
future energy supply. However, moving wind turbines into the ocean and scaling up
the turbine sizes adds new challenges compared to traditional wind turbines on
land. To realize the offshore wind energy potential, increased competence in a wide
range of professional disciplines is thus required.
In my personal professional carrier, I have dealt with topics such as ship
hydrodynamics, propeller design, model and full-scale testing, wave loads, struc￾tural loads and marine operations, as well as analyzing and testing fixed and floating
wind turbines. I have realized that the design and operation of offshore wind
turbines relies upon an understanding of a wide range of scientific and engineering
disciplines. Even if no individual involved in planning, design and operation can
master all the required disciplines in detail, some basic insight is needed to secure
precise and efficient communication between specialists. My hope is that this book
can contribute to this. The book covers a wide range of topics but does not cover
every topic in great detail. For that purpose, references are given to specialized
literature.
Most of the material included in this book is based upon material used in lecturing
graduate-level courses in marine operations at the Norwegian University of Science
and Technology (NTNU) (Nielsen, 2007) and courses in offshore wind energy at the
University of Bergen (UiB). The material also builds upon methods developed and
published during my carrier in industry. Having the privilege to lead the research
project developing the world’s first multimegawatt floating wind turbine, Hywind
Demo (installed offshore of Norway in 2009), gave me a unique opportunity to
experience the importance of cross-disciplinary insight. Also, having the privilege to
head the Bergen Offshore Wind Centre (BOW) at UiB from its inauguration in 2018
xi
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.001 Published online by Cambridge University Presshas given me the opportunity to further explore and learn the importance of cross￾disciplinary work. At BOW, e.g., noise from wind turbines, the erosion of turbine
blades, impacts on the marine environment, societal perspectives and legal issues
have been covered. These are all important issues for the successful development of
offshore wind energy, but are not covered in this book.
My hope is that this book can be used in graduate as well as continued education
within offshore wind energy, giving a broad overview of key topics related to the
environmental conditions and dynamic response of offshore wind turbines. For
deeper insight into, e.g., meteorology, aerodynamics and marine hydrodynamics,
specialized courses and literature should be consulted.
This book could not have been written without the encouragement and inspiration
of several persons, among them: Christina Aabo of Aabo Energy and a member of
the Scientific Advisory Board (SAC) of BOW; Jan-Fredrik Stadaas of Equinor and
a member of SAC; Adjunct Associate Professor Marte Godvik, UiB and Equinor;
Professor Henrik Bredmose, DTU and member of SAC; and Dr. Kristin
Guldbrandsen Frøysa, Energy Director at UiB. Many individuals have also contrib￾uted with comments and advice on specific chapters, among them several present and
former colleagues: Adjunct Professor Bjørn Skaare, University of Stavanger and
Equinor; Dr. Herbjørn Haslum, Equinor; Dr. Rolf Børresen; Adjunct Professor
Birgitte Rugaard Furevik, UiB and Norwegian Meteorological Institute; Associate
Professor Mostafa Bakhoday Paskyabi, UiB; Professor Cristian Guillermo Gebhardt,
UiB; Professor Joachim Reuder, UiB; Associate Professor Etienne Cheynet, UiB;
Dr. Astrid Nybø, Odfjell Offshore Wind; and Dr. Ida Marie Solbrekke, NORCE.
Thanks to all for their contributions! Thanks also to Anna Therese Klingstedt for
creating the illustrations of floating wind turbines.

Introduction
1.1 Motivation
Wind energy is an increasingly important source of renewable energy. Presently,
most wind turbines are installed on land. However, lack of available land area as well
as the need for good and stable wind conditions have stimulated the development of
offshore wind turbines. Moving offshore has also allowed for a considerable increase
in the size of wind turbines; presently, 10–15 MW turbines are the state of the art,
while even larger turbines are under development. Moving offshore involves new
challenges, both with respect to the design for the offshore environment as well as for
the installation, operation and maintenance of the turbines.
The first offshore wind farm, Vindeby, Denmark, was installed in 1991 in a water
depth of approximately 4 m. The 11 turbines had a rated power of 0.45 MW each.
The technology used for the early offshore wind turbines was the same as for the
land-based turbines, only that the tower was “elongated” to provide support for the
structure through the water column. The early development of offshore wind
turbines resembles that of the offshore oil and gas industry in the 1940s to 1960s.
The technology used offshore was very similar to the technology used on land. To
compensate for the “new” wet environment, the equipment was placed upon
a simple platform, or substructure. In the beginning, the installations were made
in water depth of less than 10 m. As the industry moved, step by step, into deeper
waters and the size of the wind turbines increased, the same basic design was
applied and the technology was extrapolated. However, a significant shift in
technology has occurred through the introduction of floating platforms, which
have required a rethinking of the complete design.
As the size of individual wind turbines as well as wind farms increases, and as
wind farms are located further from shore, in deeper waters and in harsher environ￾ments, new technologies are needed. Modification of land-based technology is not
sufficient. To design and operate offshore wind turbines, a real multidisciplinary
1
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.002 Published online by Cambridge University Pressapproach is needed. The disciplines comprise meteorology, aerodynamics, hydro￾dynamics, structural dynamics, material technology, cybernetics, power electronics
and several others related to environmental impact, logistics and economics.
1.2 Content of the Book
The focus of the present book is on some key issues that make offshore wind
turbines different from land-based wind turbines.
Understanding the offshore environment – the wind and wave conditions – is key
to understanding the dynamics of offshore wind turbines. Therefore, a description
of the marine atmospheric boundary layer and classical wave theory is given in
Chapter 2. Some basic wave statistics are also included in this chapter.
For the sake of completeness, the aerodynamic principles behind a wind turbine
are dealt with in Chapter 3. Classical approaches such as the Betz limit and the
beam element momentum (BEM) method are described. Further, the dynamic
response of the wind turbine, which becomes more important as the size of the
turbine increases, is discussed. In addition, vortex methods are described in some
detail, which may represent an intermediate and efficient step between the classical
BEM and more complete RANS1 or LES2 methods for analyzing the aerodynamics
of wind turbines.
In Chapter 4, various offshore support structures are discussed. There has been
continuous development of new support structures in the last decades. Still, the
monopile is the most frequently used substructure.3 Various jacket structures and
tripods are also used. In more recent years, the development of floating support
structures has gained speed. The world’s first multimegawatt floating offshore wind
turbine, Hywind Demo, was installed off the west coast of Norway, at Karmøy, in
2009. A 2.3 MW turbine was used on this test unit. In 2017, the first floating
offshore wind farm was installed off the east coast of Scotland. The wind farm
consists of five turbines, each of 6 MW. The support structure is of the Hywind
brand.
To provide a background for the dynamic analysis of wind turbines, Chapter 5 is
included to summarize some simple classical dynamics of linear systems.
The basic principles for computing wave loads on fixed support structures are
covered in Chapter 6. The focus is on slender vertical structures, but the principles
behind the theory of computing wave loads on large-volume structures of general
shape are also included. Further, some issues related to wave forces in steep waves

effects due to waves.
Wave loads and wave-induced dynamics of floating support structures are
covered in Chapter 7. Here, some classical approaches based upon slender body
assumptions and linear theory are outlined in detail. Such methods are computa￾tional-efficient and may thus be useful in, for example, optimization processes. To
compute the rigid body dynamics of a floating body, the mass, damping and inertia
matrices must be established. Each of these matrices are discussed and the restoring
effects of mooring lines are examined in some detail. Finally, the need for a motion
control system for floating wind turbines is discussed.
Marine operations are an important part of installing as well as operating a wind
farm. In Chapter 8, the issues of weather windows and duration statistics are
discussed and the dynamics of lifting operations from a floating crane vessel are
considered in some detail. The probability of impact during a load transfer oper￾ation is discussed, as well as a simple approach for estimating the impact loads
during load transfer by a crane. Issues related to wind farms are discussed in some
detail in Chapter 9, in particular, simple wake models and the summation of wakes.
This book does not handle in detail the classical aerodynamic analysis of wind
turbines. This may be found in textbooks such as those by Hansen (2015) or
Manwell et al. (2009). Issues related to choices of material and corrosion in the
offshore environment are not covered in this book. The same goes for the gener￾ation and transformation of electrical power, as well as electrical cable issues.
1.3 The Design Process
A wind turbine must be designed to fulfil several criteria related to, for example,
operational conditions and extreme conditions. The various design criteria will
determine which analysis is needed in the design process. In standards such as IEC
61400–3 (2009) and DNV (2021a), the criteria are formulated as limit states.
A limit state is “a condition beyond which a structure or structural component
will no longer satisfy the design requirements.” According to the standard issued by
DNV (2021a), four different “limit states” have to be considered in the design of
offshore wind turbine structures.
The serviceability limit state (SLS) corresponds to the tolerance criteria applic￾able to normal use, i.e., the SLS design check should ensure that the structure
works under normal operating conditions.
The fatigue limit state (FLS) corresponds to failure due to the effect of cyclic
loading, i.e., the FLS design check should ensure that during the lifetime of the
structure, the cumulative effect of cyclic loading should not damage the structure.
Introduction 3
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.002 Published online by Cambridge University PressThe ultimate limit state (ULS) corresponds to the maximum load-carrying
resistance, i.e., the ULS design check should ensure that the structure is
able to withstand the extreme loads typically experienced without damage.
The accidental limit state (ALS) corresponds to (1) maximum load-carrying
capacity for (rare) accidental loads or (2) post-accidental integrity for
a damaged structure, i.e., the ALS design check is to secure that the structure,
if exposed to loads beyond the ULS level, does not collapse, and that it may
survive even in damaged condition.
DNV (2021a) lists the following examples of limit states within each category.
Serviceability limit states (SLS)
Deflections that may alter the effect of the acting forces.
Excessive vibrations producing discomfort or affecting nonstructural components.
Excessive vibrations affecting turbine operation and energy production.
Deformations or motions that exceed the limitation of equipment.
Durability.
Differential settlements of foundations soils causing intolerable tilt of the
wind turbine.
Temperature-induced deformations.
Fatigue limit states (FLS)
Cumulative damage due to repeated loads.
Ultimate limit states (ULS)
Loss of structural resistance (excessive yielding and buckling).
Failure of components due to brittle fracture.
Loss of static equilibrium of the structure, or of a part of the structure,
considered as a rigid body, e.g., overturning or capsizing.
Failure of critical components of the structure caused by exceeding the
ultimate resistance (which in some cases is reduced due to repetitive loading)
or the ultimate deformation of components.
Transformation of the structure into a mechanism (collapse or excessive
deformation).
Accidental limit states (ALS)
Structural damage caused by accidental loads (ALS type 1).
Ultimate resistance of damaged structures (ALS type 2).
Loss of structural integrity after local damage (ALS type 2).
Prior to the design process for the support structure,4 the site-specific environmen￾tal condition as well as the design of the rotor-nacelle assembly (RNA) must be

4 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.002 Published online by Cambridge University Pressknown. Based upon these, the design basis for the support structure is formulated.
Several operational cases (design situations) and environmental conditions (load
cases) are analyzed. These include:
• normal design situations and appropriate normal or extreme external conditions
• fault design situations and appropriate external conditions
• transportation, installation and maintenance design situations and appropriate
external conditions
For each case, the load effects are analyzed and checked as to whether they satisfy
the appropriate limit state. If not, the design must be modified.
To check if the structure fulfils the limit states, one has to check if the “capacity”
(e.g., material strength) of the structure is sufficient to withstand the loads acting
upon it. This is normally done by use of the “partial safety factor method.”
Formally, this is expressed by requiring that the “resistance” of the structure, Rd,
shall exceed the design load effect, Sd:
Sd ≤ Rd ½1:1
The design load effect, Sd, is obtained from the “characteristic load” effect, Sk, by
multiplying by a load factor, γf , Sd ¼ γf Sk. For example, the characteristic load
effect for a ULS is the load combination that has an annual probability of exceed￾ance of 0.02 or less. That is, the load has a return period of at least 50 years. In an
FLS, the characteristic load effect history is defined as the expected load effect time
history during the lifetime of the structure.
Similarly as for the load effect, the design resistance is obtained by dividing the
characteristic resistance by a material factor, γm, Rd ¼ Rk=γm.
The load factor, γf , is introduced to account for uncertainties in the methods for
estimating the loads as well as to account for statistical uncertainties in the loads,
for example, the statistics of waves. Similarly, the material factor, γm, shall
account for uncertainties in the capacity of the material, such as yield strength,
thickness, fatigue capacity and so on. As an example, DNV (2021b) states that γf
should be set to 1.35 for environmental loads in a ULS check, while the material
factor γm should be set to 1.10 for the strength of steel tubular members (DNV,
2021a). The load and material factor will vary depending on load case considered
and failure mode.
For FLS checks, several issues must be accounted for. The fatigue capacity of
a steel material depends upon the steel quality, plate thickness, corrosion protection
and weld geometry and quality, as well as accessibility for inspection of critical
details. With all these factors included and using a characteristic load time history,
Introduction 5
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.002 Published online by Cambridge University Pressthe cumulative fatigue damage during the lifetime of the structure should be less
than one half to one third of the damage causing failure.
1.4 The Layout of Wind Turbines
The function of a wind turbine is to convert the kinetic energy in the wind to
rotational energy. Rotational energy was in the past used for grinding (“windmills”)
or pumping water. Today, rotational energy is converted to electric energy by an
electrical generator. Various design principles of wind turbines exist and some
features of the main ones are discussed briefly in the following sections.
1.4.1 Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbines
The horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) is the most frequently used wind turbine.
In Figure 1.1 (left), an illustration of the layout of a HAWT is given. Both on land
and offshore, a HAWT is mounted upon a slender tower. In most cases the rotor
consists of three blades mounted on an almost horizontal axis. The axis may have
some tilt to avoid collision between the blades and the tower during rotation. The
rotor is usually mounted on the upwind side of the tower. Each blade has the profile
of an aerofoil. How this works is described in Chapter 3.
Wind blowing into the rotor makes the rotor rotate. Considering the aerodynam￾ics of large rotors, the optimum rotational speed is too low for a standard electrical
generator to be efficient. Therefore, a gear is mounted between the rotor shaft (the

that may be in the order of 100. A four-pole generator should run at 1500 revolu￾tions per min to generate 50 Hz AC power. Thus, if the rotational speed of the
turbine is 15 revolutions per min, a gear ratio of 100 is needed. Several multimega￾watt turbines are now equipped with so-called direct-drive generators, illustrated in
Figure 1.1 (right). A direct drive implies that the gear is removed and a generator
with a large diameter and many poles along the circumference is used. The
generator used is frequently a permanent magnet generator. The many poles secure
a sufficiently efficient generation of electrical power even if the rotational speed is
low. The frequency of the AC power generated does not normally fit the grid
frequency. The AC current is therefore converted to DC current and back to AC
with the correct frequency and phase.
The rotor blades are mounted to the rotor hub. In the hub, a mechanism for
twisting or pitching the rotor blades is located. The pitching of blades is used to
control the power and reduce the loads on the rotor at high wind speeds. The shafts,
gear, generator, control system and power converter systems are assembled in
a housing denoted the nacelle. The rotor and nacelle assembly, frequently denoted
the RNA, is located on top of the tower. A weathervane is mounted on the top of the
nacelle, by which the direction of the wind is measured. The RNA may rotate on top
of the tower so that the rotor heads into the wind; this is accomplished by the yaw
mechanism. The operation of a modern wind turbine relies upon several systems
that control rotational speed, blade pitch and yaw angle.
As discussed in Chapter 3, the three-bladed upwind turbine illustrated in
Figure 1.1 has many advantages. However, two-bladed designs exist as well. A two￾bladed rotor is lighter and has a higher optimum rotational speed than a three-bladed
turbine. Therefore, the required gear ratio is lower. A three-bladed rotor has
a beneficial dynamic property as the mass moment of inertia is independent of
which axis in the rotor plane is considered. This contrasts with a two-bladed rotor,
which has very large difference in the mass moment of inertia about the axis
coinciding with the blade axis and the axis normal to the blade axis. This difference
in inertia may trigger unfavorable dynamic loads.
Downwind rotors also exist. By locating the rotor on the downwind side of the
tower, the collision issue between blades and tower is solved. However, every time
a blade passes the leeward side of the tower, it moves into a wind shadow, causing
severe dynamic loads. Downwind rotors may, under certain conditions, be self￾correcting with respect to wind direction. In that case, the yaw mechanism required
for the upwind turbine may be avoided.
Introduction 7
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press1.4.2 Horizontal-Axis Multirotors
The size of horizontal-axis wind turbines has steadily increased. In the 1980s, wind
turbines with a rated power of 50 KW and a rotor diameter of 15 m were common.
Currently, turbines with a rated power of 15 MW and more and a rotor diameter in
the order of 250 m are the state of the art. The power that can be extracted by a wind
turbine is proportional to the area swept by the rotor, i.e., proportional to the
diameter squared. However, the bending moment in the blade root will increase
by approximately the cube of the rotor diameter. The same goes with the mass. It
may thus be assumed that increased mass, large deformations and large and heavy
units (blades, generator) to be handled during installation and maintenance will at
some point limit the size of turbines. So far, this has not happened, but alternative
designs have been proposed to address the upscaling challenge. Wind turbine
designs with two or more rotors mounted on the same tower have been built (van
der Laan et al., 2019). Also, offshore, floating wind turbine concepts with serval
rotors mounted upon the same hull have been proposed (Jamieson, 2017). These
designs span from using two rotors to large arrays using in the order of 100 rotors.
The arguments for having many smaller rotors rather than one large rotor are related
to costs of energy and ease of handling. It may also be argued that the complete
production and assembly line is simpler and faster.
1.4.3 Vertical-Axis Turbines
As the name states, the blades of a vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) rotate around
a vertical axis, as shown in Figure 1.2. In addition to the two principles shown in
Figure 1.2, designs with helical-shaped blades exist. The cross-section of each blade
is shaped like an aerofoil, thus creating a lift force on the blade section, driving the
rotation. Drag-based systems also exist. The differences between lift-based (aero￾foil) systems and drag-based systems are discussed in Chapter 3. An important
difference is that drag-based systems are far less efficient than lift-based systems.
The main advantages of a VAWTare that most of the technical equipment, including
the generator, may be placed at ground level, and that the turbine works independent of
the wind direction. Generally, a VAWT has lower efficiency than a HAWT. The reason
for this is mainly related to the angle of attack for the blades. This angle varies during
the rotation, thus, the angle of attack most of the time is not optimum. Further, when
the blade is moving at the downwind side of the rotor, it is moving in the wake of the
upwind blade, causing reduced efficiency and larger dynamic loads due to the
increased turbulence. However, for smaller turbines – e.g., “rooftop” versions –
a VAWT may be an attractive solution.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.002 Published online by Cambridge University Press1.4.4 High-Altitude Wind Power Devices
High-altitude wind power devices (HAWP) use wind forces to stay high above ground
level and at the same time extract energy. The systems are inspired by kites. A kite, or
a wing, is connected via a line to a drum on the ground. As the kite is flying, it is forced
into a special motion pattern, for example, a figure-eight pattern, as illustrated in
Figure 1.3, or a circular pattern. By allowing the drum to rotate, the line is little by
little released from the drum and the combination of the tension in the line and
rotational velocity of the drum creates mechanical power, driving an electrical gener￾ator. When the full length of the line is out of the drum, a “home-flying” mode is
activated; the kite descends and the line is wound up on the drum under low tension.
Power is thereby produced as the kite flies up, while a small amount of power is used
when it flies back “home.”
As an alternative to extracting power when the kite flies up and tensions the
line, other concepts equip the kite, or rigid wing, with small wind turbines that
extract wind power while the system is flying at a steady pattern at high
altitude. The Makani system5 is an example. The power is transferred via the
line down to ground level. Such a system can in principle produce power
continuously.
The main idea behind HAWP devices is to utilize the strong and steady wind of
high altitudes. These devices operate several hundred meters above ground level.
However, at the present stage of development the systems are not commercial and
do not deliver power at the megawatt scale.

The Offshore Environment
In this chapter the properties of wind and ocean waves will be described, focusing
on issues important to the extraction of wind energy and the computation of loads
from wind and waves.
The main difference between land-based and offshore wind turbines is exposure
to the offshore environment. In addition to wind, an offshore wind turbine is
exposed to waves and currents.
The main characteristics of wind are similar over land and over the ocean.
However, there are some important differences. These are, among others, related
to the sea surface. In contrast to wind over land, waves on the sea surface represent a
boundary for the wind, with surface roughness depending upon wave height.
Further, the temperature difference between sea and air follows a different pattern
over time than the temperature difference between land and air. The consequence is
that the wind field offshore differs from that on land. Thus, experience gained from
land-based wind turbines has some limitations when it comes to offshore turbines.
Ocean waves represent a new environmental parameter to consider when moving
wind turbines offshore. A proper description of ocean waves is thus needed to
establish proper estimates of fatigue and extreme loads on structures. For floating
wind turbines, wave-induced motion is also an important design consideration.
How much detail is needed for the description of wave kinematics depends upon
the geometry of the support structure, the load cases considered and, e.g., the
relative importance of wind versus wave loads. For some applications, a lineariza￾tion of the kinematics and loads is sufficient, while in other cases a careful
description of the kinematics of the extreme waves should be considered.
Ocean currents in most cases do not themselves represent critical loads.
However, currents modify waves and may thus modify wave-induced loads. For
bottom-fixed support structures, a speed-up of currents close to the seabed may
cause the transport of sediments away from the immediate vicinity of the wind

fixture of the wind turbine to the sea floor.
In the following, some basic principles for describing the wind field and ocean
waves are presented. The description of the theoretical background and the level of
detail are limited. To get a deeper insight into the material presented, please see the
references given.
2.1 Wind
2.1.1 Introduction
For offshore wind turbines, the wind represents the energy resource. However, the wind
also causes loads on the turbine structure. These loads must be accounted for in the
design. In applications related to offshore wind farms, the wind field must be understood
and described across a wide range of length and timescales. In the design of rotor blades,
the turbulent structures of the wind field in the range of meters and seconds are
important in the assessment of dynamic loads, while to understand the flow inside
and in the vicinity of a wind farm length scales in the range of hundreds of meters to
several kilometers and time scales in the range of a few minutes to hours must be
considered. Prediction of the energy production hours ahead requires an understanding
of the wind field at meso-scale range (tens of kilometers in length and hours in time).
In the design of offshore structures, simplistic descriptions of the wind field have
been used in most cases. This is because the focus has been on the estimation of
extreme loads with probability of occurrence in the range 10−2
–10−4 per year. For
offshore wind turbines the needs are different. Still, extreme as well as operational
loads are important factors in design. However, as the largest rotors exceed 200 m
in diameter and are very slender and flexible structures, a detailed understanding of
the structure of the wind field is very important, from both a power extraction and a
structural design point of view.
A thorough description of the turbulent wind field over the ocean will not be
given here. For a detailed description of the meteorology of the atmospheric
boundary layer, reference is made to special textbooks, e.g., Lee (2018) and Stull
(1988). The following description will restrict the discussion to some of the main
parameters used to describe the wind field suitable for the design of wind turbines.
It will also address some of the challenges encountered, such as with increased rotor
sizes. Relevant time and length scales are illustrated in Figure 2.1.
2.1.2 The Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer
The atmospheric boundary layer1 is the region between ground or sea surface and
the “free” atmosphere. In the free atmosphere the effect of the surface friction on
1 The general discussion of the atmospheric boundary layer is valid for boundary layers both over sea and land.
When the marine atmospheric boundary layer is considered, the abbreviation MABL is used.
12 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University Pressthe wind field can be ignored. Between the free atmosphere and the boundary layer
there frequently exists a capping layer, which limits the exchange of air between the
boundary layer and the free atmosphere. The elevation of this capping or inversion
layer is highly dependent upon the weather conditions. The various layers of the
atmospheric boundary layer are illustrated in Figure 2.2. A typical order of magni￾tude of the elevation of the capping layer during neutral and unstable atmospheric
conditions, also denoted as convective conditions, may be around 1 km. However,
this may vary a lot and during stable atmospheric conditions the elevation of the
capping layer can be as low as a few hundred meters and even below 100 m.
Atmospheric stability is discussed in more detail in Section 2.1.2.2. In the upper
part of the boundary layer, also denoted as the Ekman layer, the direction of the
mean wind is strongly influenced by the combined effect of the Coriolis forces and
the vertical gradient of the mean wind speed, causing a continuous shift of mean
wind direction down through the boundary layer. The lower part of the boundary
layer is called the surface layer. The thickness of the surface layer is in the order of
10% of the boundary layer, and traditionally it has been assumed that wind turbines
operate in this layer. However, large offshore wind turbines may operate above this
height. In the surface layer the turbulent mixing due to vertical velocity shear is

turbulence. In the immediate vicinity of the ground or sea, there is a viscous
sublayer. We will focus here on the surface layer. The considerations are somewhat
simplified as, e.g., the Coriolis forces are neglected, as is frequently done in wind
energy applications.
2.1.2.1 Mean Velocity Profile
To describe the flow field in the atmospheric boundary layer, the Navier–Stokes
equations are invoked. In Appendix A, a brief summary of the two-dimensional
boundary layer equations for an incompressible flow is given. Here, some classical
relations between the mean velocity profile, the fluctuating velocity components
and the shear are given. These relations are utilized in describing some key
characteristics for the MABL.
A Cartesian coordinate system is used, with the x-axis horizontal and positive in
the mean wind direction and the z-axis vertical, positive upwards and zero at the sea
level. The velocity in x-direction can then be written as a mean value plus the
turbulent fluctuation, u ¼ u þ uʹ. The mean transverse and vertical velocities are
assumed to be zero, while the fluctuating components are denoted as vʹ and wʹ
respectively. The variation in mean wind direction with height due to the Coriolis
effect is thus disregarded. In solving the Navier–Stokes equations for the mean
flow, a closure problem exists. Terms denoted Reynolds stresses of the form ρauʹwʹ,
ρauʹvʹ and ρavʹwʹ appear in the equations, where ρa is the density of air. The
Reynolds stresses are related to characteristics of the mean flow. Based upon
empirical evidence, the Reynolds stresses are assumed proportional to the vertical
velocity gradient in the boundary layer. This is according to the Prandtl mixing

surface layer, z0 to z, the velocity profile is obtained as:
u zð Þ¼ u
ka
ln z
z0
 : ½2:3
z0 is frequently denoted as the surface roughness length scale. Charnock (1955)
found a relation between z0 and u by measuring the wind field over a water
reservoir. The vertical profile of the lowest 8 m over the water surface fitted the
logarithmic profile in Equation 2.3 well. The mean velocity profile in the surface
layer thus gives u zð Þ¼ 0 0, even if the mean velocity at top of the friction layer has
some small but finite value. Charnock (1955) found the empiric relation between
the roughness length scale and the friction velocity as:
z0 ¼ α0
u2

g : ½2:4
This is called the Charnock relation. Over open sea, with fully developed waves, the
Charnock constant α0 has, according to DNV (2021c), values in the range of 0.011–
0.014, and near coastal sites it may be 0.018 or higher.
For offshore conditions, z0 and u depend upon the wind speed, upstream
distance from land and wave conditions. DNV (2021c) proposes z0 in the range
0.0001 to 0.01 for open sea conditions. The lowest value corresponds to calm
water and the highest to rough wave conditions. Onshore, higher values for z0
apply.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University PressThe friction velocity may be related to the mean velocity at a certain vertical
elevation and a surface friction coefficient. Frequently, the 10 min mean wind
velocity at a height zr over the ground or sea surface, denoted U10ð Þ zr , is used as
a reference. By combining the above relations and defining a surface friction
coefficient κ ¼ τ=ρaU2
10ð Þ zr , the following expression for the friction velocity and
friction coefficient is obtained:

Frequently, a reference height zr ¼ 10m is used. With the above range of z0,
κ- values in the range 0.0012 and 0.0034 are obtained.
The above formulations rely upon the assumption of a near neutral boundary layer
and constant turbulent momentum fluxes in the vertical direction. Above the surface
layer and in stable or unstable boundary layers the assumptions are not valid. Below
the surface layer, in the viscous sublayer with a vertical extent in the order of mm, the
flow is mainly laminar and is, as the name indicates, dominated by viscous effects.
Viscous effects do not play an important role above this layer. Some more details
related to the two-dimensional boundary layer equations are outlined in Appendix A.
In engineering applications, [2.3] is frequently replaced by a simpler power
function, written as:
U10ð Þ¼ z U10ð Þ zr
z
zr
 α
: ½2:6
Here, U10ð Þz is the 10 min mean wind velocity at vertical level z. By requiring the
mean wind speed at the vertical level z as obtained by [2.3] and [2.6] to be equal, a
relation between z0 and α is obtained:
αð Þ¼ z
ln lnð Þ z=z0
lnð Þ zr=z0
 
lnð Þ z=zr
: ½2:7
The result is plotted in Figure 2.3 (left) for three different values of the roughness
length, z0. It is observed that the proper α value depends upon at which height the
two expressions for the mean velocity are required to fit. In Figure 2.3 (right), the
relation between z0 and α for three different fitting heights is plotted. A reference
height of zr ¼ 10 m is applied in the graphs.
As indicated above, the mean wind velocity depends upon the time of averaging.
When considering extreme wind velocities, the extreme mean velocity with a

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University Presscertain return period, for example 10 or 50 years (corresponding to a yearly
probability of occurrence of 0.1 and 0.02, respectively), increases if the time of
averaging is reduced, e.g., from 1 h to 10 min. The extreme wind velocity also
increases with increased turbulence intensity.
The above wind profiles should be used with care in heights above approxi￾mately 100 m as the assumption of constant turbulent fluxes above this level may be
doubtful. Few wind measurements of the mean wind profile above this level exist.
An example on data beyond this level is rawinsonde data, as discussed by Furevik
and Haakenstad (2012).
2 Another option to measure the wind speed at high eleva￾tions is by using Lidars; see Section 2.1.5.3.
2.1.2.2 Stability
The mean velocity profiles discussed in the previous section are obtained assuming
constant turbulent fluxes in vertical direction and neutral stability of the atmosphere.
During unstable and stable atmospheric conditions, the profiles must be modified.
The atmospheric stability is related to the vertical temperature profile in the air. In
simple terms, the stability condition may be understood by considering a volume of
air (an air parcel) at a certain vertical level. In the initial position of the parcel, the
temperature inside the parcel is equal to the temperature of the surroundings. Moving
this parcel upwards causes the volume to expand due to the reduced pressure. The
expansion implies work is done. Assuming the expansion is adiabatic, i.e., there is no

2 A rawinsonde is a balloon equipped with instruments that is released from the ground or a ship. It measures
parameters such as pressure, temperature, relative humidity and position (by GPS) on its way up to altitudes of
greater than 30 km. Sometimes a rawinsonde is called a radiosonde; however, a radiosonde normally does not
measure position (see the National Weather Service website, www.weather.gov/; accessed December 2022).

temperature is equal to the surrounding temperature, the density of the air in the parcel
is equal to the density of the surrounding air and there is an equilibrium, or neutral
stability. If, on the other hand, the temperature inside the expanded parcel is lower than
the external temperature, the density of the air in the parcel is higher than the density of
the surrounding air. The parcel will thus tend to sink back down to its original position,
i.e., the conditions are stable. However, if the temperature of the air parcel in the new
vertical position is higher than the surrounding temperature, the air parcel will tend to
move further upward, i.e., the conditions are unstable.
Assuming dry air, the adiabatic expansion or compression of the air parcel will
behave according to the ideal gas law:
pV ¼ nRT
pVγ ¼ Constant: ½2:8
Here, n is the number of moles in the volume, R is the universal gas constant, V is
the volume considered, p is the absolute pressure, T is the absolute temperature and
γ ¼ cp=cv is the gas constant for air. cp is the specific heat under constant pressure,
while cv is the specific heat under constant volume. For dry air, γ ¼ 1:40.

I.e., under the assumption of dry air, the temperature is lowered by 1o
C per 100 m of
increased elevation. The requirement of “dry air” is strict; the relation holds also if no
phase change takes place and there is no heat transfer by radiation. Note that the change in
density with pressure has been ignored as we are considering small pressure differences.
If the air contains a lot of water vapour, condensation of water may take place as the
air is cooled. The condensation releases heat, resulting in a lower temperature decay.
The effect is temperature- and pressure-dependent, but in most cases the lapse rate is in
the range of 0:51:0o
C per 100 m.
18 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University PressIn studying the atmospheric boundary layer, it is convenient to use the
potential temperature, θ, rather than the sensible (measured) temperature, T. To
obtain the potential temperature, assume that the air at any z level is moved
adiabatically downwards to the ground level. The temperature the air then will
obtain is the potential temperature. Assuming dry air, the potential temperature
becomes:
θ ¼ Tz

γ

Thus, in a neutral stratified atmosphere, the potential temperature is constant with
height.
Over land, the ground is heated during the day and cools at night. Over sea,
the diurnal variation vanishes, as the incoming radiative energy is efficiently
distributed over a large volume of water. Therefore, over the sea, the synoptic
weather situation, e.g., cold air advection with northerly winds (in the north￾ern hemisphere) over relatively warm water, or warm air advection with
southerly winds over relatively cooler water, and seasonal effects control the
stability of the marine atmospheric boundary layer. The first example, cold air
over warm water, happens most frequently during autumn and winter and
causes an unstable or convective situation, while the case of warm air over
cold water occurs more frequently during spring and summer, causing a stable
situation. In Figure 2.4, a simplistic illustration of the vertical profile of the
potential temperature in the case of stable, neutral and unstable (convective)
conditions is given. Figure 2.6 illustrates the vertical variation of the mean
wind speed for the unstable, neutral and stable conditions. Here the simple
exponential velocity profile, [2.6] is assumed.

The Offshore Environment 19
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University PressDuring unstable, or convective, conditions, the air close to the sea surface
will be warmed by the sea and tend to move upwards, causing vertical
mixing due to the buoyancy effect. The lower part of the boundary layer,
in the region with a negative gradient of the potential temperature, the
combined effect of turbulent shear stresses and buoyancy effects gives
good vertical mixing. Above the surface layer, in the mixed layer, the
potential temperature is almost constant. In the mixed layer, the vertical
gradient of the mean velocity is low. The mixed layer may extend to about
1 km above sea level. Above the mixed layer, normally an inversion or
capping layer exists, where the potential temperature increases and thus
partly blocks the mixing of air into the free atmosphere. During unstable
conditions, the surface layer may become fairly thick, in the order of 100–
200 m. An illustration of the potential temperature through the various layers
is given in Figure 2.5 (left).
During stable conditions the potential temperature increases from the sea
level upwards. As the velocity gradient is large close to the sea surface, the
vertical mixing is efficient in this region. Further up, however, the mixing is
suppressed by the positive gradient of the potential temperature and the
mixing diminishes. A vertical distribution of potential temperature through
the various layers is illustrated in Figure 2.5 (right). During stable conditions,
the surface layer is thinner than during unstable conditions, perhaps even less
than 50 m. Above the surface layer, a residual layer is present where the
potential temperature has a slightly positive gradient and the turbulent mixing
is low.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University PressCoriolis forces act on the wind field. As the mean wind speed in general increases
with height, Coriolis forces causes the wind direction to change with height. In the
northern hemisphere, the wind direction at ground level is directed to the left
relative to the wind direction above the boundary layer, the geostrophic wind.3
There are various ways to characterize the atmospheric stability conditions. A
simple, qualitative assessment of the static stability can be performed by consider￾ing the gradient of the potential temperature.4 ∂θ=∂z < 0 corresponds to unstable
conditions, ∂θ=∂z ¼ 0 corresponds to neutral conditions, while ∂θ=∂z > 0 corres￾ponds to stable conditions.
A physical, consistent way to quantify the degree of stability of the boundary
layer is to compare the contribution by velocity shear and buoyancy effects to the
production of turbulent kinetic energy. The buoyancy effect may, depending upon
the sign of the surface heat flux, both increase and decrease the kinetic turbulent
energy. The flux Richardson number – see, e.g., Lee (2018) – expresses the ratio
between the buoyancy and velocity shear effects in the production of turbulent
kinetic energy. The flux Richardson number is written as:

atmospheric stability conditions, assuming same mean velocity at height 100 m.
3 Above the boundary layer, the wind direction is determined from a balance between the pressure gradient force
and the Coriolis force. The Coriolis force deflects the wind direction away from the direction of the pressure
gradient (toward the right in the northern hemisphere) until the wind direction is parallel to the isobars. This is
denoted as geostrophic wind. 4 In the calculation of potential temperature, dry air is assumed. Frequently, the virtual potential temperature is
used. In the virtual potential temperature, the humidity of the air is accounted for.

Shear production is the shear stress times the gradient of the mean velocity.
θʹ denotes the turbulent potential temperature fluctuations, similar to the velocity
fluctuations. The relation is derived by using the two-dimensional Navier–Stokes
equation. In deriving the relation for the buoyancy production, the vertical pressure
gradient set to ρg and the relation between the density and the temperature is
according to the ideal gas law. The minus sign in the shear production term
(see Appendix A) has been omitted. R ¼ 0 corresponds to no buoyancy
effects and thus a neutral condition. R < 0 corresponds to positive buoyancy
effects and thus an unstable condition. At R ¼ 1 the turbulence production from
buoyancy effects and the velocity shear effect are equal. R > 0 indicates a stable
condition. Theoretically, R ¼ 1 represents an upper limit at which the destruction of
turbulence caused by the buoyancy balances the production due to the vertical
shear.
The flux Richardson number is height-dependent. This is not explicitly shown in
[2.11]. However, as discussed above, in the surface layer, where constant vertical flux of
turbulence may be assumed, the velocity gradient may be expressed by [2.3]. Further,
using that uʹwʹ ¼ u2

Here, L denotes the Obukhov length (also denoted the Monin–Obukhov length). As
the Obukhov length is expressed by the surface friction and the vertical turbulent heat
flux, it is independent of height (in the region of validity of the assumptions applied).
It is therefore frequently used to classify the stability of the boundary layer. Van Wijk
et al. (1990) propose the following ranges for characterization of stability.
Very stable: 0 m < L < 200 m
Stable: 200 m < L < 1000 m
Near neutral: jLj > 1000 m
Unstable: 1000 m < L <  200 m
Very unstable: 200 m < L < 0 m
A discussion of measured offshore wind speeds, turbulence and stability is found in
Nybø et al. (2019) and Nybø et al. (2020). In Figure 2.7, the various regions of
stability are shown as a function of the inverse of the Obukhov length.
22 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University PressAs the quantities used in the flux Richardson number are not readily available, an
alternative is to use the gradient Richardson number. Here, the ratio between the
gradient of the potential temperature and the gradient of the square of the mean
wind speed is considered. The flux Richardson and gradient Richardson numbers
are related via the eddy diffusivities for eddies and heat; for details, see Lee (2018).
2.1.2.3 Shear Exponent and Stability
Over land, the shift between stable and unstable conditions in the atmospheric
boundary layer frequently follows a diurnal period. As mentioned in Section
2.1.2.2, the heat exchange between sea and atmosphere differs from that between
land and atmosphere. This affects the stability condition of the atmospheric bound￾ary layer and thus the vertical shear profile of the mean wind speed. Figure 2.8
illustrates how the shear exponent α in [2.6] may vary over the year at an offshore
location in the North Sea (Myren, 2021). The results are obtained by considering 11
years of hindcast data in the NORA3 dataset (Haakenstad et al., 2021). In Figure 2.8
it is also observed that the variation shear exponent closely follows the temperature
difference between 100 m elevation and sea level, ΔT ¼ T100  T0. With this
difference less than −1°C, stable atmospheric conditions may be assumed. In the
case shown in Figure 2.8, this happens most frequently during autumn and winter.
The study by Myren (2021) showed that the variations over the year were less
pronounced as the location moved farther north and farther offshore. This may be
explained by lower variation between sea and air temperature in these regions.
It should be noted that the shear exponents in Figure 2.8 in general are lower than
recommended in many standards. DNV (2021c) recommends a general α- value
over open sea with waves offshore equal to 0.12. This value does not account for
atmospheric stability. However, DNV (2021c) gives advice on how the shear profile
may be adjusted considering the Obukhov length. The IEC standard 64100-3
(2009) recommends the “normal wind profile” over sea α ¼ 0:14, using the refer￾ence height equal to hub height. For extreme wind speeds averaged over 3 s and a
return period of 50 years, IEC 64100-3 (2009) recommends α ¼ 0:11 and use of a
gust factor of 1.1. No correction for stability conditions is included in this case.

the stable, near neutral and unstable conditions from the temperature difference
ΔT150 between the temperature 150 m above sea level and the sea temperature. The
unstable, near neutral and stable conditions were defined by ΔT150 <  1,
1 ≤ ΔT150 ≤ 0, ΔT150 > 0. ΔT150 in °C. The corresponding average α-values were
found as 0.04, 0.05 and 0.09. These α-values are, as the hindcast data above, lower
than recommended by the standards. In all standard wind energy applications an
increasing wind speed with height has been assumed. Furevik and Haakenstad
(2012) observed frequently (in more than 1500 of 8700 cases) a decreasing wind
speed with height. In general, these cases had unstable atmospheric conditions. The
observations were made in the North Atlantic on the weather ship Polarfront.

As discussed above, the wind speed at a specific point may be characterized by the
mean value plus a stochastic variation, u ¼ u þ uʹ. The turbulence level is charac￾terized by the standard deviation of the wind speed, σu ¼ σuʹ. Also, the transverse
and the vertical components of the velocity fluctuations are of importance.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University Pressenergy community has considered fluctuations in the mean wind direction only. The
turbulence intensity is thus normally written as:
TI ¼ σu
u : ½2:13
The numerical value of σu is sensitive to the length of the record considered.
Traditionally, records of 10 min duration have been used in the wind industry.
However, using longer records, e.g., 1 h, increases the computed value of σu as the
wind spectra contain significant energy at low frequencies. Also, real wind data are
never really stationary. Nybø et al. (2019) discuss ways to handle real wind data for
use in the analysis of wind turbine dynamics.
Considering a short period of time, e.g., from 10 min to 1 h, the time history of the
wind speed may be considered a stationary process. Several formulations of wind
spectra are proposed. The most common spectra used for offshore conditions are the
Kaimal, von Kármán, Davenport and Harris spectra; see, e.g., DNV (2021c). For
example, the Kaimal spectrum may, according to IEC 61400 (2005), be written as:
Skð Þ¼ f σ2
k
A Lk
Uref
1 þ B fLk
Uref  5=3 : ½2:14
f is the frequency and Lk is a length scale parameter. Uref is the mean wind velocity
at a reference height, zr, e.g., the hub height. The index k refers to the velocity
components: k ¼ 1 mean wind direction, k ¼ 2 lateral direction and k ¼ 3 vertical
direction. IEC 61400 (2005) recommends the values given in Table 2.1 for the
parameters, depending upon direction.
The length scale parameter is given as:
Λ1 ¼ 0:7 zr for zr < 60 m
42 m for zr ≥ 60 m :

½2:15
A = 4 and B = 6 are recommended values. Note that in all wind spectral formula￾tions, the high-frequency tail of the spectrum should be proportional to f 5=3.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University PressThe wind spectrum may be divided into three ranges: a low-frequency range
where large-scale turbulence is generated, denoted as the production range; a
medium-frequency range where there is a balance between energy gained from the
larger eddies and the energy lost to even smaller eddies, denoted as the inertial
subrange; and a high-frequency range where the eddies are so small that the energy is
lost in viscous dissipation, denoted as the Kolmogorov dissipation range. The order
of magnitude length and time scales for each of these ranges are indicated in
Figure 2.1. Experience shows that spectra such as, e.g., the Kaimal formulation
represent the measured spectra well in the inertial subrange, at least in near neutral and
unstable conditions. The length and time scales in the dissipation range are so small that
they do not have any practical impact on wind turbines. However, the energy content in
the lower range of the inertial subrange and in the production range may not be well
represented by the “standard” spectra. This is a frequency range important to floating
structures due to the low natural frequencies for such structures.
Figure 2.9 gives examples of the Kaimal spectrum. For frequencies above about
0.1 Hz, the slope of the spectrum is close to f 5=3. Observe that changing the turbulence
intensity while keeping the mean velocity causes a vertical shift in the spectral curve.
The formulation in [2.14] represents the spectrum in the main wind direction and
uses the standard deviation in that direction, σu. For the lateral and vertical velocity
components, the design standards propose the use of the same spectral formulation,
but with modified standard deviations (see Table 2.1).
The turbulence intensity, as defined by [2.13], is in general assumed to decrease with
increasing mean wind velocity. Nybø et al. (2019) and Nybø et al. (2020) investigated

FINO1 (www.fino1.de/en/; accessed July 2023). Careful quality control of the data was
performed priortothe analysis. The quality controlimplies removing erroneous data due
to spikes, missing samples, mast shadow effects etc., as well as implementing require￾ments related to the stationarity of the records. In Figure 2.10, turbulence intensities for
the FINO1 data at 119 m above sea level are plotted for a large number of 60-min
records. The TI values are averaged over six consecutive 10-min records sampled at
10 Hz. As shown in the figure, the turbulence intensity is sensitive to the stability of the
atmospheric boundary layer. Nybø et al. (2020) used the classification of stability based
upon the Obukhov length as given in Section 2.1.2.2. Figure 2.10 also includes turbu￾lence intensities as recommended in the IEC standard 61400-3 (2009) for offshore wind
turbines. These values are supposed to represent the 90th percentile of measured
turbulence intensities. The 90th-percentile curves as given in the IEC standard decay
monotonically with increasing wind speed. In Figure 2.11 the distribution of stability
conditions in the data of Nybø et al. (2020) are plotted as function of mean wind speed.
At very low and very high wind speeds, the few occurrences introduce large uncertain￾ties in the distribution.

speed. The IEC standard assumes the surface roughness can be solved iteratively from
the expression z0 ¼ Ac=g½κUhub=lnð Þ zhub=z0
2
. Here, AC is the Charnock parameter
and κ is von Kármán’s constant. The standard deviation of the wind in the mean
wind direction is written as σ1 ¼ Uhub=lnðzhub=z0Þ þ 1:84 I15. Here, I15 is the
turbulence intensity at hub height at 15 m/s wind speed. In Figure 2.10, the IEC
turbulence intensity curve is included, using AC ¼ 0:011, κ ¼ 0:4 and I15 ¼ 0:12,
corresponding to Class C wind turbines. The surface roughness length varies in this
case from 4.8E-07 at 1 m/s wind speed to 7.9E-04 at 25 m/s wind speed. The
measurements reveal a large scatter in turbulence intensity for the various records
analyzed. The turbulence intensity during unstable atmospheric conditions is in
general higher than during neutral and stable conditions.
Classical theory describes how the wind shear over the ocean surface creates
surface waves, starting from short, capillary waves. As the duration of the wind and
or the fetch length increase, the waves become longer, ending up as long-periodic
swells with periods beyond 15 s. The understanding of how waves cause variation
of the wind speed over an ocean surface is less developed. The waves interact with

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University Pressthe wind field both by representing a wavy boundary condition and by a time￾varying drag force. The drag force between the air and water is related to the
relative velocity between the two media. As the water particles moves back and
forth, a time-varying drag force will result. Kalvig (2014) studied the effect of the
moving boundary and found that long swells could cause variation in the wind
speed at vertical levels corresponding to the rotor of an offshore wind turbine.
However, more research is needed to fully understand the impact of the waves on
the wind field.
2.1.2.5 Coherence
The above discussion on the turbulence spectra is confined to the velocity variation
in time observed in one point. To compute the wind loads on a wind turbine, the
velocity variations in space are also of importance. To describe the spatial vari￾ations, the coherence is used. The coherence of a wind field tells how the variation
in wind speed at one point correlates to the wind speed at another point. Consider
the rotor plane of a wind turbine. If the rotor diameter is small, it may be assumed
that the wind speed is fully correlated over the rotor plane. This holds at least for the
frequency ranges important for estimating the power production and dynamic
loads. As seen from the power spectra in Figure 2.9, high frequencies correspond
to low energy content.
As the diameter of the rotor is increased to beyond 200 m, the issue of correlation of
the turbulence over the rotor plane beomes increasingly significant. The variation in the
u velocity over the rotor plane is obviously important. Due to the shear in
the mean velocity profile, it is to be expected that the correlation in the
u-velocity for points separated in the horizontal direction differs from the
correlation between points separated in the vertical direction. Variations in the
v and w turbulent velocity components over the rotor plane have had less
attention but do also influence the rotor blade loads. In the following, the
discussion is limited to the variation in the u-velocity component.
Consider two points, 1 and 2, separated by a distance r12. The auto-spectra for the
wind velocity at points 1 and 2 may be denoted S11ð Þf and S22ð Þf . Similarly,
the cross-spectrum for the velocities at points 1 and 2 may be denoted S12ð Þf . The
coherence may now be written as:
γðf ;r12Þ ¼ S12ð Þf ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
S11ð Þf S22ð Þf p : ½2:16
The auto-spectra are real and positive, and in most cases almost equal in the two
points considered. However, the cross-spectrum is in the general case a complex
quantity. The coherence is therefore also complex, i.e., it contains information
The Offshore Environment 29
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University Pressabout the phases or the time shift between the two time series considered. The real
and imaginary parts of γð Þ f ;r are denoted the co-coherence and quad-coherence
respectively. In most wind energy applications the absolute value of [2.16] is used
as the coherence, i.e., the coherence is written as follows (Burton et al., 2011):
cohðf ;rÞ¼jγðf ;r12Þj ¼ jS12ð Þj f ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
S11ð Þf S22ð Þf p : ½2:17
In most wind standards an exponential coherence function is proposed, e.g., IEC
(2005) proposes a coherence on the form:
coh f ð Þ¼ ;r exp 12 fr
U
 2
þ 0:12
r
Lk
 2 !0:5 2
4
3
5: ½2:18
Here, U is the mean wind velocity, to be taken at hub height. Lk ¼ 8:1Λ1 is the
coherence scale parameter; see [2.15]. [2.18] is supposed to be valid for the x
component of the velocity and describes the coherence between two points located
in the same x  y plane (e.g., the rotor plane) at a distance r. From [2.18] it is
observed that the coherence according to this formulation is always real and
positive. It is also observed that the coherence tends to expð Þ 1:44r=Lk as the
frequency tends to zero. For other coherence models, e.g., the Davenport model
(Davenport, 1962), the coherence converges toward unity for zero frequency.
The above formulation of the coherence is to be combined with a model of the point
spectrum of the wind, e.g, the Kaimal turbulence spectrum [2.14]. Using the “Sandia”
method (Veers, 1988), a complete wind field satisfying the point spectrum as well as
the coherence function may be generated. Further details are given below. Frequently,
only the variation of the u – component of the wind is considered in these models.
2.1.2.6 Mann’s Turbulence Model
Based upon a linearized version of the Navier–Stokes equations, Mann (1994)
developed a tensor-based model for the spatial structure of the turbulence in the
surface layer of the atmosphere. This is the original version of Mann’s turbulence
model. The effect of the earth’s rotation, i.e., Coriolis forces, is ignored. To come up
with a model for all three turbulent components of the wind field, several important
simplifying assumptions are made. Key assumptions are that the air is assumed
incompressible; further, a neutral stability of the atmosphere and a uniform shear of
the mean velocity are assumed, i.e.:
u zð Þ¼ z
du
dz ; ½2:19
30 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University Presswith du=dz constant. The model uses von Kármán’s turbulence spectrum with
isotropic turbulence as a starting point. The effect of shear is included by the so￾called “rapid distortion theory” (RDT). The RDT describes how the sheared wind
field distorts eddies. Eddies with rotation are either stretched or compressed along
the axis of rotation depending upon the direction of rotation. Further, large eddies
are assumed to live for longer than small eddies. Small eddies are assumed to be
isotropic, simplifying the spectral tensor considerably. Large eddies are assumed to
be anisotropic, causing the three components of the velocity fluctuations to differ
and fulfil the relation:
σu > σv > σw: ½2:20
Further, the ensemble average of the product of the horizontal and vertical turbulent
velocities, 〈uʹwʹ〉, becomes negative, as expected from the 2D boundary layer
equations; see Appendix A.
If the fluctuation of the wind speed is measured at a fixed point in space, a
time-history of the wind speed is obtained and, by spectral analysis, a fre￾quency spectrum is obtained, as shown in Figure 2.9. In the spectral formula￾tion by Mann (1994), a wave number spectrum is used rather than a frequency
spectrum. The instantaneous wind speed variations along the x-axis at a
certain point in time are considered. Computing the spectrum of these wind
speeds, u xð Þ; v xð Þ; w xð Þ, a spectrum based upon wave number is obtained.
Invoking the Taylor’s frozen turbulence hypothesis implies that the turbulent
structures are assumed to be moving downstream with the average wind
speed, i.e.:
uðx þ u△t; y;z; t þ △tÞ ¼ uðx; y;z; tÞ: ½2:21
Bold types denote a vector. Denoting the spectrum based upon wave number F kð Þ, the
relation between the frequency and wave number representation is given by
S f ð Þdf ¼ F kð Þ1 dk1 with k1 ¼ 2πf =u. Here, k1 is the wave number along the
x axis. The wave numbers along the y and z axes are independent of the mean
velocity.
The model uses the covariance tensor as a basis, denoting the covariance
tensor as:
Rijð Þ¼ r 〈uið Þx ujð Þ x þ r 〉; ½2:22
where x ¼ ð Þ x; y;z is the position vector, r is a distance vector and ui are the
turbulent velocity components, and 〈〉 denotes ensemble average. In a homoge￾neous flow field, the covariance tensor depends upon the absolute value of the
distance only. Similarly, as the ordinary frequency spectrum is obtained from the
The Offshore Environment 31
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University PressFourier transform of the auto-correlation function, a spectral tensor is obtained
from the Fourier transform of the covariance tensor, i.e.:
Φijð Þ¼ k
1
ð Þ 2π
3 ∭Rijð Þr eð Þ ikr dr1dr2dr3: ½2:23
The integrals are taken from ∞ to þ∞. k ¼ ð Þ k1; k2; k3 denotes the wave number
vector. The spectral tensor is transformed to an orthogonal process, and the velocity
field is then obtained from the Fourier transform of this process. Mann (1994) shows
how the spectral tensor and Fið Þ ki can be obtained assuming an isotropic turbulence,
using von Kármán’s energy spectrum. Then, introducing a vertical shear, the spectral
tensor is modified, and an anisotropic flow is obtained. The degree of anisotropy is
determined by a parameter controlling the length of life of the eddies.
Three key parameters are used in Mann’s (1994) formulation of the wind field: a
length parameter L to describe the characteristic size of eddies; a parameter Γ to
characterize the length of life of eddies; and a viscous dissipation rate for the
turbulent kinetic energy.
Starting out with von Kármán’s turbulence spectrum, the point spectrum for the
u velocity is obtained as:
Fuð Þ¼ k1
9
55
αε2
3
1
L2 þ k2
1
 	5=6 : ½2:24
Here, αε2=3 is the parameter characterizing the viscous dissipation rate for the
turbulent kinetic energy. k1 is the wave number in x direction. ε is the specific
turbulent dissipation as given from the kinematic viscosity and the kinetic turbulent
energy ε ¼ ν dui=dxj
 	 (see Appendix A). α is an empirical constant equal to
approximately 1.7.
From [2.24] it is observed that the characteristic length, L, may be obtained from
Fuð Þ0 . However, Mann (1994) comments that the value of the spectrum at low wave
numbers (low frequencies) is strongly influenced by non-stationarity and large￾scale meteorological phenomena. He therefore suggests using the maximum of
k1F kð Þ1 as reference. Considering the u component of the velocity, it is found that:
L≃
1:225
k1max
; ½2:25
where k1max corresponds to the maximum value of k1F kð Þ1 .
The linearization of the Navier–Stokes equations causes unrealistic behavior of
the flow and the eddies to be distorted beyond what is physical realistic. Therefore,
the parameter Γ, limiting the length of life of the eddies, is introduced. Eddies are
32 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University Presssupposed to break up as time goes on and small eddies break up faster than large
eddies. Mann (1994) applies an assumption that the length of life of the eddies may
be written in the form:
τð Þk ∝ k2
3Λ ∝
k2=3 for k → ∞
k1 for k → 0 :

½2:26
Λ is related to the hypergeometric function;6 for details, see Mann (1994). The limit
of τ as k →∞ is assumed valid in the inertial subrange. In the inertial subrange,
[2.26] may be rewritten as a nondimensional lifetime as:
βð Þk ≡ du

Γ: ½2:27
Γ is to be determined empirically. For Γ ¼ 0, an isotropic flow is obtained, i.e.,
σu ¼ σv ¼ σw. As Γ increases, the differences between the three standard deviations
increase. In Figure 2.12, the relation between Γ and the variances in the three

made by introducing a blocking effect, accounting for zero vertical velocity com￾ponent at ground level.
In Mann (1998) and (1994), the above model was tested and the parameters
estimated based upon full-scale measurements and for various model wind spectra.
Cheynet, Jakobsen and Obhrai (2017) found, based upon offshore data at the
FINO1 platform for wind velocities at 80 m above sea level and a wind speed
range of 14–28 m/s, average values Γ ¼ 3:7, αε2=3 ¼ 0:04 m4=3 s2 and L ¼ 70 m.
The estimated values for Γ and L are approximately constant over the range of
velocities considered, while αε2=3 shows a marked increasing trend, from about
0:02 m4=3 s2 at the lowest velocity to 0:07 m4=3 s2 at the highest velocity.
To account for non-neutral atmospheric stability, Chougule et al. (2018) intro￾duce a modification of the original Mann model. A linear vertical variation of the
potential temperature is introduced. One or alternatively two extra parameters are
needed for this model.
When applying the Mann model for wind field simulations, the tensor descrip￾tion of the wind field in the wave number domain is transformed to an instantaneous
wind field in the ð Þ x; y;z domain for the three turbulent componentsð Þ u; v;w . This is
done by first transforming the spectral tensor, Φijð Þ k , into a set of orthogonal
processes (functions). By Fourier transform and summation of these orthogonal
functions, the wind field is obtained. Consistent with the frozen turbulence hypoth￾esis, the wind turbine may be moved through this field to obtain a time-dependent
inflow.
2.1.3 Numerical Generation of Wind Fields
Several options exist to generate wind fields that can be applied for analyzing wind
turbines. First, an undisturbed wind field approaching a wind farm must be con￾sidered. Next, to analyze the wind field inside a wind farm, the effect of wakes has
to be accounted for. Here, the generation for the free wind field is discussed briefly.
The effect of wind turbine wakes is discussed in Chapter 9.
In Mann (1998), an efficient algorithm is given for computing the wind field
according to the principles outlined above. One or more components of the turbu￾lence may be generated assuming neutral atmospheric stability and constant verti￾cal gradient of the mean wind speed. The result is a “wind field box” of specified
size in ð Þ x; y;z . Realistic spectral shape and variances for the three components of
the wind speed as well as the covariance of the horizontal and vertical velocity
components are obtained.
Veers (1984) and (1988) describes the “Sandia method” for generating a wind
field. In this method the three turbulent components are assumed to be uncorrelated
34 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University Pressand can thus be generated independently. The time histories of the wind speed at
several points in a plane perpendicular to the mean wind direction are considered.
The plane may coincide with the rotor plane. The time histories of the wind speed in
each point are supposed to be Gaussian and the point spectrum of the wind in each
point (point number n of total N) is given by a frequency spectrum, Snð Þf . In most
cases the spectrum is assumed equal for all the points considered. The subscript n is
thus omitted in the following. The spectrum is represented by a summation of M
frequency components, each with amplitude ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
2S fð Þ m Δf p . Here, Δf is the frequency
increment and a single-sided spectrum is assumed. The wind speeds at two points
are not independent. The degree of correlation depends upon the distance between
the points. Consider the rotor plane and denote two points in the plane, j and k, with
the coordinates x; yj;zj
 	 and ð Þ x; yk;zk . The cross-spectrum for the wind speed
between the two points can be written as:
Sjkð Þ¼ fm γ fm; Δrjk  	 ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
Sjjð Þ fm Skkð Þ fm
q
: ½2:28
Sjjð Þ fm is the auto-spectrum (point spectrum) in point j. As mentioned above,
Sjjð Þ¼ fm Skkð Þ fm is normally assumed. Δrjk is the distance between the two points.
Note that the coherence depends upon the distance between the points and does not
distinguish between vertical and horizontal separation. Taylor’s frozen turbulence
hypothesis is applied, i.e., the turbulent eddies, the velocity variations, are moved
downstream with the mean wind velocity. Veers (1984) assumed that the coherence
function is real and positive. This assumption was justified by the fact that within
the typical rotor sizes considered, the phase shift in the velocity components over
the rotor, even in vertical direction, is small. The assumption simplifies the compu￾tations significantly. The assumption of a real and positive coherence function
contrasts with the results that are obtained by Mann’s formulation, which may
result in negative cross-spectra and an imaginary part of the cross-spectra different
from zero.
The time history of the wind speed is to be generated in N points in the rotor
plane. Each time history is assumed to be a filtered white noise process, obtained by
summation of the M frequency components. Further, the correlation between the
time series shall satisfy [2.28]. For each frequency, the spectral matrix Sð Þ fm
contains the spectral value for all combinations of j and k altogether N2 values.
As the distance between two points is equal in both directions, Sð Þ fm is symmetric.
In general, Sð Þ fm may be rewritten as the product between a complex transform￾ation matrix and the transposed of its complex conjugate, i.e.:
Sð Þ¼ fm Hð Þ fm HTð Þ fm : ½2:29
The Offshore Environment 35
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University PressAs Sð Þ fm is assumed real, Hð Þ fm is real and equal to its complex conjugate. It is now
assumed that Hð Þ fm is a lower triangular matrix. The non-zero values may then be
determined by a set of recursive equations (see Veers, 1984), i.e.:
H11 ¼ S1=2
H21 ¼ S21=H11
H22 ¼ S  H2

: ½2:30
This matrix is unique for each frequency, fm. Veers (1988) states that “the elements
of H may be thought of as weighting factors for the linear combinations of N
independent, unit-magnitude, white noise inputs that will yield N correlated outputs
with the correct spectral matrix. Each row of H gives the contribution of all the
inputs to the output at point k.”
The harmonic components along the diagonal of H at each frequency fm are
assumed to be uncorrelated. This is obtained by assuming each component has an
independent, random phase θjm between 0 and 2π. A unit amplitude diagonal matrix
X is thus introduced with the elements:
Xjjð Þ¼ fm eiθjm : ½2:31
The harmonic component of the velocity with frequency fm in point n may thus be
written as a linear sum of the contribution from the point itself and its neighbors,
accounting for the lower diagonal structure of H:
Vn ð Þ¼ fm
Xn
k¼1
Hnkð Þ fm Xkkð Þ¼ fm
Xn
k¼1
Hnkð Þ fm eiθkm : ½2:32
Having established all the frequency components for each point, the time-history is
obtained by a Fourier transform of Vn. For details and an example of usage, see Veers
(1988).
In Nybø et al. (2021), the coherence of the u-component of the velocity as
computed by various methods is compared. The results are illustrated in
36 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University PressFigure 2.13. The wind fields are computed by Mann’s method, as described, using
standard parameters as recommended from the design standards and fitting the
turbulence level to measurements. Further, a version of Mann’s model with fitting
of the spectral shape is employed, known as “FitMann” (Cheynet, 2019).
“TIMESR” uses the Sandia method, as described, with input from wind measured
at three different vertical levels. The Davenport exponential coherence function is
used with parameters fitted to the measurements. The specific condition considered
in Figure 2.13 has close to neutral atmospheric stability. The vertical coherence is
also computed directly from the measurements. The measurements are from an
offshore meteorological mast, FINO1 (Nybø et al., 2019; Nybø et al., 2020).
From Figure 2.13 it is observed that the measured vertical co-coherence is
negative in some ranges of frequencies. The observed negative co-coherence is
partly captured by the two Mann’s models. This is not the case for the Davenport
coherence model, in which the co-coherence is forced to be positive. For the
horizontal coherence, no measurements are available. However, Mann’s model
still predicts negative co-coherence in some ranges of frequencies. Measurements
also show quad-coherence different from zero, in particular in the vertical direction.
A vertical quad-coherence different from zero is also obtained by Mann’s model.
However, present practice in wind turbine design frequently ignores the quad￾coherence.
In addition to the methods discussed above, numerical methods based upon
solving the Navier–Stokes equations are used. Still, most of the methods available
are too computationally demanding to be used directly in the design process.

phenomena, these methods are very useful.
The simplest version is the so-called Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes
(RANS) solvers. As the name indicates, these methods average out all
turbulent variations and give a picture of the time-averaged flow only. The
effect of turbulence is parameterized to ensure proper shear and dissipation
of energy in the flow. Such methods are of limited value in considering wind
turbines.
The most relevant Navier–Stokes solver methods are the large-eddy simu￾lation (LES) methods. In this approach the turbulent structures with sizes
above a certain limit are resolved in the numerical model, while the smaller￾scale turbulence is parameterized to ensure proper turbulent dissipation of
energy. Two frequently used implementations are the Parallelized Large￾Eddy Simulation Model (PALM; Maronga et al., 2015) and the Simulator
fOr Wind Farm Application (SOWFA; see, e.g., Churchfield et al., 2012).
These computational tools typically start from a meso-scale wind field
that is refined by using a finer-grid scale in the wind farm area, and this
locally refined flow model is coupled with a wind turbine model to compute
power production, loads and wakes behind the turbines.
The starting point for the models is the three-dimensional momentum equation
driven by a horizontal pressure gradient and accounting for Coriolis forces due to
the rotation of the earth. The air may be considered incompressible, but with the
buoyancy effect included by assuming that the vertical variation of the density of
the air follows the variation in potential temperature, the so-called Boussinesq
approximation. The density of the air at some vertical level, z, may thus be
written as:
ρð Þ¼ z ρð Þ zr 1  θð Þ z θð Þ zr
θð Þ zr

 : ½2:33
Here, zr is some vertical reference level.
The turbulent fluctuations of the velocities are split into resolved vari￾ations and sub-grid variations. The closure of the sub-grid problem is not
trivial and several closure methods exist (Maronga et al., 2015). Also,
coupling the coarse meso-scale7 model to a finer micro-scale model repre￾sents a challenge. This may be performed by a one-way or a two-way
coupling.
7 The meso-scale has a range from a few kilometers to several hundred kilometers. The micro-scale ranges from a
few hundred meters to a few kilometers.

To obtain a stationary flow field, a “precursor” simulation may be performed. The
simulation is run with a given horizontal pressure gradient, a surface roughness and, for
example, a constant heat transfer from the ground. At the upper boundary, a “free slip”
condition is normally used. To simulate the capping inversion layer at the top of the
atmospheric boundary layer, a fixed positive gradient of the potential temperature may be
applied in the upper part of the computational domain. In the precursor run, the flow will
gradually change from the initial flow (e.g., a homogeneous flow) to a flow with proper
shear, turbulence and temperature profile. The result from this precursor run may then be
used as an input to a more refined model with wind turbines. An example of a precursor
run is shown in Figure 2.14. Here, a flow field with an extent of 5.12 km x 5.12 km x
1.28 km is used. Thus, about 34 million grid cells are used in the domain. To obtain the
wanted turbulence intensity at nacelle level, in this case approximately 100 m above sea
level, a surface roughness length of 0.0001 m is used. Neutral atmospheric stability is
obtained by using zero heat flux from the ground. To include turbines in the flow, a refined
grid is needed in the vicinity of the turbines and a stepwise reduction in the size of the grid
size is used. In Figure 2.15, an example of a such stepwise reduction of the grid size is
shown. The placement of the turbines is also illustrated. The technique of including more
refined grids inside a coarser grid is called nesting. In the present example, the inner
domain has a grid size of 2.5 m. By using nesting as illustrated in Figure 2.15, the total
number of grid cells will increase to approximately 100 milion.

2.1.4 Long-Term Wind Statistics
In the design of wind turbines and to estimate the expected energy production, a long￾term statistic of the mean wind speed is required. For several locations around the world,
historical time series for the key meteorological data are available for several years. The
data are given on a horizontal grid and at several vertical levels. Examples of such
datasets are NORA10 and its updated version NORA10EI (Haakenstad et al., 2020) and
NORA3 (Haakenstad et al., 2021). Both NORA10 and NORA3 cover significant parts
of the North Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. NORA10 has a temporal resolution
of 3 h and a horizontal grid of approximately 10 km x 10 km. NORA3 has a finer
temporal and spatial resolution of 1 h and 3 km x 3 km. The datasets cover about 50 and
30 years respectively. The models are based upon downscaling from larger-scale
meteorological models. Such datasets are called hindcast data as they are based upon
numerical simulation of historical weather with observations assimilated into the
simulations. In addition to wind data, pressure, wave and temperature information is
available.
Figure 2.16 shows an example of the long-term distribution of the 10 min mean wind
velocity 100 m over the sea level at a specific location in the North Sea (the proposed
wind field area “Utsira North”). The data were obtained over 15 years using the NORA3
database. The three-parameter Weibull probability distribution is normally used to

Here, α ð Þ > 0 is the scale parameter, used to normalize the variable; γ ð≤ xÞ is the
location parameter, used to define a lower threshold for the variable; and β ð Þ > 0 is
the shape parameter, defining the shape of the distribution. For the data shown in
Figure 2.16, the parameters are estimated as α ¼ 12:31, γ ¼ 0:848 and β ¼ 2:18.
The distribution may be used to estimate extreme values with certain return periods;
for details, see Section 2.3.2. By combining the long-term distribution of the mean
velocity with the power production characteristics of the wind turbine, the statistics
of the power production at a certain location are obtained. The power characteristic
is discussed in Section 3.8. Similarly to the long-term yearly distribution of the
wind speed, seasonal distributions are frequently used.
The instantaneous wind velocity differs over the ocean area. Figure 2.17 illus￾trates the 10 min mean wind speed during the extreme weather event “Dagmar” in
2011. Large spatial variations in wind speed are observed. Such spatial variations
are also present during more normal weather situations. Knowledge about the
spatial correlation of the mean wind velocities may be utilized to mitigate the
intermittent nature of wind power; see, e.g., Solbrekke et al. (2020).

Several techniques exist for measuring wind speed. They differ in the ability to
measure wind direction, resolve high-frequency wind components and measure the
different directional components of the turbulent wind. Some techniques also
average the wind speed over a volume. In the following sections, some of the
most common techniques are discussed in brief.
2.1.5.1 Cup Anemometers
Cup anemometers (Figure 2.18) are widely used for wind measurements. The main
principle relies upon the fact that the drag force of a conical cup is larger for flow
into the cup than for flow from the back of the cup. In the “Risø” version of the cup
anemometer, three cups are mounted on a vertical axis. The rotational resistance in
the bearings is very low, causing the rotation to start at very low wind speeds. The
rotational speed of the cup anemometer is close to proportional to the wind speed.
The relation between wind speed and rotational speed is discussed in some detail in
Figure 2.17 Wind speed during the extreme weather event “Dagmar,” December
25, 2011. 10 min mean wind speed in m/s at 21:00 UTC. Courtesy the Norwegian
Meteorological Institute.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University PressSection 3.5, where a cup anemometer is considered in a power production context.
Cup anemometers are considered accurate but have some disadvantages, e.g., they
measure the total horizontal wind speed only and give no information about wind
direction. To obtain the wind direction, a separate wind vane must be used. As the
rotor system has a certain inertia, high-frequency wind speed variations will not be
measured. In turbulent wind, the average wind speed tends to be overestimated.
This is because the drag characteristic of the cups will cause the rotor to rapidly
speed up during a wind speed increase, but the rotational speed will reduce more
slowly during wind speed decrease. The cup anemometer must be mounted on a
mast. Care must thus be taken to avoid shadow or speed-up effects due to the mast
and mounting system. Wind directions affected by the mast and mounting system
should be removed from the subsequent data analysis.
2.1.5.2 Sonic Anemometers
Sonic anemometers use ultrasonic senders and receivers. Consider the two com￾bined sender and receiver sensors illustrated in Figure 2.20. The time a sound signal
requires to move from one sensor head to the other is given by:

sensors A and B. The distance between the sensors is L. The speed of sound is c.

Figure 2.19 shows an example of a three component sonic anemometer. Compared
to the cup anemometer, the sonic anemometer has the advantage of a very high
frequency resolution and the possibility of measuring all components of the wind.
As for the cup anemometer, one must be aware of possible shadow effects of the
mast and mounting arrangement. Experience shows that the sonic anemometer may
give erroneous results during rainy weather; see, e.g., Nybø, et al. (2019).
2.1.5.3 Lidar
The LIDAR measurement technique is a remote sensing technique. The name
LIDAR originates from an abbreviation of “light-based radar” or “light detection
and ranging.” A simplistic view of the basic principle is illustrated in Figure 2.21.
A narrow beam of laser (monochrome) light is sent out from the LIDAR unit. The
light is scattered by aerosols in the air and some of the light is back-scattered into
the LIDAR’s receiver system, which utilizes the Doppler effect. By detecting the
change of frequency in the back-scattered light, the speed of the aerosol particles,
i.e., the wind speed in the direction of the laser beam, Us, is obtained. As the light
beam has a finite angle and the duration of the analyzed scattered signal has a finite
duration, the velocity obtained is a weighted average over a volume, as illustrated in
Figure 2.21. Typical averaging lengths in the direction of the beam are in the order
of tens of meters. Assuming no mean vertical component of the wind speed, the

laser beam is obtained as Uβ ¼ Us=cosα. Uβ is the horizontal wind speed compo￾nent in direction β and α is the angle between the laser beam and the horizontal
plane.
To obtain the total horizontal wind speed, at least two orthogonal measure￾ments must be performed. In practice, to obtain the total horizontal velocity, a
circular sweeping pattern of the laser beam can be used, as illustrated in
Figure 2.22. The laser beam measures the velocities Usi at a number
of azimuthal angles βi
. The relation between the mean horizontal wind
velocity, U, and the measured speed in the direction of the laser beam is thus:
Usi ¼ U cos βi  β0 ð Þ cosα: ½2:37
Here, β0 is the mean direction of the wind. By measuring for several values of βi
, the
mean wind speed and the mean direction are obtained. A key assumption used to
obtain the mean wind speed by this approach is that the wind field is homogeneous
over the sweeping area.
Other remote measurement techniques utilize sound (SODAR) and microwaves
(RADAR) to obtain the wind velocity. The sound signals are scattered by tempera￾ture differences in the air. Assuming that such temperature structures are advected
with the mean wind speed, the wind speed in the direction of the sound wave is
obtained by considering the frequency shift between emitted and reflected sound (for
details, see, e.g., Lang and McKeogh, 2011). Microwave radars may be used in
combination with SODAR. The radar signals may interfere with the sound waves
through the so-called Bragg effect. This makes it possible to determine temperatures
in addition to velocities.

2.2.1 Introduction
This section will give the classical linear description of gravity waves in the
ocean. This is the most common wave description used in the computation of
wave loads on marine structures. To compute the loads on marine structures, we
must know about the surface elevation of the waves as well as the velocity and
acceleration fields in the water below the free surface. An important feature of the
linear description is the principle of superposition. This makes it possible to
describe a complex sea state by a summation of harmonic components. Some
issues related to the nonlinearity of waves will also be addressed. Fixed offshore
wind structures are normally located at water depths where the sea bottom “is
felt” by the waves. Such finite water depth conditions are important for the wave
kinematics.
More details on the modeling of ocean waves may be found inWorld Meteorological
Organization (2018), Mork (2010), Faltinsen (1990) and DNV (2021c).
2.2.2 Assumptions
Ocean gravity waves may be modeled under the assumptions that water is incom￾pressible and that capillarity effects and viscous effects may be ignored. In the
following, constant density is also assumed. This implies that we are not consider￾ing internal waves. Such waves may occur in cases with water of low salinity on top
of more saline water. However, internal waves are normally not considered in the
design of offshore wind turbines.
To derive the governing equations for linear-gravity waves, it is assumed that the
velocity field can be described by a velocity potential ϕ and that the fluid velocities
are obtained from the gradients of the velocity potential:
u ¼ ∇ϕ: ½2:38
Here, u ¼ ðu; v; wÞ
T is the velocity vector given by the components of the
velocity in the x; y and z directions. The ð Þ x; y; 0 plane is at the mean free surface.
z is vertical, zero at the mean free surface and positive upwards; see Figure 2.23.
Under the condition that the fluid is incompressible and irrotational, the potential
will satisfy Laplace equation throughout the fluid:
∇2
ϕ ¼ ∂2ϕ
∂x2 þ

The Offshore Environment 47
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University Press2.2.3 Solution
To solve the above Laplace equation, proper boundary conditions must be imposed.
To simplify the problem, it is assumed that the waves propagate in positive
x-direction, so the velocities in y-direction are zero, ∂ϕ
∂y ¼ 0. The following boundary
conditions are then to be imposed at the sea bottom and at the free surface.
Under the condition that the bottom is horizontal, zero vertical velocity must be required at
the bottom, i.e.:
∂ϕ
∂z ¼ 0 at z ¼ d: ½2:40
At the free surface, two conditions are to be imposed: one kinematic and one
dynamic. The kinematic condition implies that particles, once located at the free
surface, will remain there, i.e., the particles on the free surface must follow the
motion of the free surface. This may be expressed as:
∂ζ
∂t
¼ ∂ϕ
∂z
 ∂ϕ
∂x
∂ζ
∂x
at z ¼ζ : ½2:41
Here, ζ is the free surface elevation. The first term is the vertical velocity of the free
surface at a specific x-position. This vertical velocity must equal the two terms
on the right-hand side, the first one being the vertical velocity of the water and
the second being the horizontal velocity of the water multiplied by the slope
of the surface. This condition is to be satisfied at the instantaneous free
surface level.
The dynamic free surface condition is the requirement of constant pressure on
the free surface, equal to the atmospheric pressure. Invoking Bernoulli’s equation,
we may write:

The first term is the pressure related to the acceleration of the fluid, the second term
is due to the velocities and the third term is the hydrostatic contribution.
The kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions on the above forms imply a
nonlinear solution of the problem. Exact analytical solutions of this problem do not
exist. However, several approximate solutions are derived, in particular the class of
Stokes wave solutions that are found by a series expansion of the problem. Classic
solutions are Stokes second-order and Stokes fifth-order waves; see, e.g., Sarpkaya
and Isaacson (1981). These classical solutions assume an infinite train of equal
waves. Each wave is also symmetric in the sense that the front and back slope of the
wave crest are equal. This is not in accordance with the geometry of real steep
waves.
To obtain a linear solution of the above boundary value problem, the following
approximations are introduced. It is assumed that the slope of the waves is small
and that the boundary conditions may be satisfied at z ¼ 0 rather than at z ¼ζ .
The small slope approximation implies that the second term on the right-hand
side of [2.41] is much smaller than the first term and is thus ignored. Similarly, the
velocity-squared terms in [2.42] are ignored. [2.41] and [2.42] are in linearized
form thus written as:
∂ζ
∂t
 ∂ϕ
∂z ¼ 0 at z ¼ 0
∂ϕ
∂t
þ gζ ¼ 0 at z ¼ 0
: ½2:43
The constant in the Bernoulli equation may be set to zero. By taking the time
derivative of the dynamic boundary condition and combining it with the kinematic
condition, the two equations may be combined into one, which constitutes the
linearized free surface boundary condition:
∂2ϕ

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University PressIt is further assumed that the solution shall represent a harmonic progressive wave.
The Laplace equation [2.39] is combined with the linear boundary conditions in
[2.40] and [2.45] and the solution may be written as:

Here, k ¼ 2π=λ is the wave number and λ is the wavelength. ω ¼ 2π=T is the wave
angular frequency and T is the wave period. d is the water depth. H is the double
amplitude for the wave, equal to twice the single amplitude, ζA, under the assump￾tion of linear waves. For nonlinear waves, however, the height of the wave crest and
the depth of the wave trough differs, and it is convenient to use the distance from
trough to crest, the wave height, as a measure. It is implicit that it is the real part of
the quantities which has physical meaning. The free surface elevation is
obtained as:

A frequently used assumption is that the deep-water formulation may be used if the
water depth is greater than half the wavelength. Another result is the so-called

frequency:

more details, see Section 2.2.5):
c → ffiffiffiffiffi
gd p as d →0

: ½2:52
We observe that the speed of the waves becomes independent of wave period as the
water depth tends to zero. This is the case as long waves approaches a shallow
beach. In deep waters, waves with long periods move faster than those with short
periods. If we observe the wave field in the open ocean, we see that wave crests
exist for a short period of time and then seems to disappear. This is because the
crests we observe is composed of many wave components with different wave
periods. As the long waves move faster than the short waves, the positive summa￾tion of components that formed the crest at a certain instant in time no longer exists
after a short while. It should also be noted that the energy flux in the wave is slower
than the wave celerity. The energy moves with a speed called the group velocity. In
deep water, the group velocity is half the celerity.
The above equations summarize the key features of linear-gravity waves. From
these equations, the velocities, accelerations etc. can be derived. Table 2.2 presents
some key relations. Derivation of higher-order solutions, e.g., Stokes waves of orders
two and five, may be found in Sarpkaya and Isaacson (1981) and Fenton (1985).
Table 2.2 gives an expression for the average energy density in the wave. This
density is per unit free surface area. It can be shown that in deep water the average
energy density has equally large contributions from the free surface elevation, the
hydrostatic part and the kinematic part, i.e., the velocity squared term integrated
from the bottom to the free surface. Note, however, that in wave energy applica￾tions, it is not the energy density per unit surface area that matters, but the energy
flux in the direction of wave propagation. The energy flux per unit width of the
wave crest is equal to the energy density multiplied by the group velocity of the
waves.
The kinematics according to linear wave theory is valid for z ≤ 0 only. To
estimate the kinematics above the mean water level, various approximations are
used in practical applications. These are discussed in some detail in Section 2.2.7.
2.2.4 Waves in Shallow Water
In deep water, the wave steepness is the only parameter important to the validity of the
linear wave theory discussed here. In shallower water, the ratio of the water depth to the
wavelength also becomes an important parameter. The following three parameters may
be used to characterize waves in limited water depth (see DNV, 2014a).

Here, λ0 and k0 are the linear deep-water wavelength and wave number corres￾ponding to the wave period T. The Ursell parameter expresses the ratio between the
second-order amplitude and the first-order amplitude in a Stokes wave formulation
(Sarpkaya and Isaacson, 1981) and is used to classify the range of validity for
various wave descriptions. The Stokes second-order contribution to the surface
elevation may be written as:

Here, H is the wave double amplitude, including both the first- and second-order
contribution.
For the linear wave theory to be valid, the wave steepness should be small,
S << 1. Further, the second-order component of the wave amplitude should be much
less than the first-order amplitude. This is obtained if the Ursell parameter is much
less than 1, Ur << 1. It is observed that if the shallow-water parameter, μ, is reduced,
then the Ursell parameter increases. This demonstrates that the Stokes wave
representation of the waves breaks down in very shallow water.
The linear approach, also called Airy waves, has a fairly large range of
validity with respect to wave steepness in deep water, while the range of
validity is reduced as the water depth is reduced. Deep water may usually be
assumed if μ > 0:5. It is common to assume that the limiting steepness, or breaking
limit, for regular waves in deep water is S=1/7. This is, however, far beyond the
validity of linear theory. In very shallow water a breaking limit of H/d = 0.78 is
commonly assumed. For water that is not so shallow, the limit is lower (Grue et al.,
2014).
Various recommendations exist with respect to the applicability of linear
wave theory and various nonlinear formulations. Such recommendations may
be found in various design standards, e.g., DNV (2021c). However, the
applicability of the various approximations depends upon the use, e.g., if an
accurate estimate of crest height is important, if local structural loads close to
the free surface are to be estimated, if the loads are inertia- or drag-domin￾ated etc.
From the above relations, it is observed that when waves move from deep water
and into shallower water, the wavelength is shortened and the wave celerity slows
down. As waves move from deep water, where they do not necessarily move
perpendicular to the isobaths, into shallower water, the direction of the waves
will change, tending to move perpendicular to the isobaths (see Figure 2.24).
This phenomenon is called refraction. In Figure 2.24, we observe how the waves
are directed away from deeper area focuses toward the shallower area. This causes
wave energy to concentrate in the shallow area, increasing wave steepness. The
refraction effect is strongest for long waves. If the coastline is not a shallow beach,
but rather a steep cliff, waves will be reflected from the cliffs, causing a wave train
that moves away from land. The combined refraction and reflection effects may
thus cause very “confused” sea in the area. Details on wave refraction are found in
Sarpkaya and Isaacson (1981).

This is independent of water depth and wave period. The energy is equally distrib￾uted between potential energy, given from the free surface elevation, and kinetic
energy, given from the particle velocity throughout the water column.
The energy flux through a surface of unit width and perpendicular to the direction
of wave propagation is given as:

considering the summation of two regular waves of almost equal wave numbers, k

difference in wave number between the two waves. It is assumed that δk≪k.
ωð Þ k þ δk is the corresponding wave frequency. The last term in [2.57] represents
a slowly oscillating term with frequency δk ∂ω
∂k and wave number δk. It is observed
that the speed of this slowly oscillating term, the “group speed,” becomes:
cg ¼ δk ∂ω

δk ¼ ∂ω
∂k : ½2:58
Thus, the last term corresponds to a wave which propagates with the speed ∂ω=∂k.
This is the speed of the “group” in the example shown in Figure 2.25. In the general
case the group speed is obtained by derivation of the dispersion relation (see [2.49]):

It is observed that in deep water, the group speed is half the phase velocity, while in
the shallow water limit, the group and phase speeds are equal. Figure 2.25 illus￾trates how the sum of two deep-water waves of approximately the same period
propagates. It is observed that the peak of the group moves with half the phase
speed, as derived in [2.61].
An example of the group speed as a function of water depth is given in
Figure 2.26. The general picture is that the group speed is reduced as the water
depth is reduced. However, in a range where the water depth is about 0.15–0.2 times
the wavelength, the group speed increases.
Consider waves moving from deep water toward shallow water. The energy flux
through every cross-section perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation
must be constant; i.e., according to [2.56], it is obtained that the wave height has to
vary as H dð Þ=Hd → ∞ ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
cg dð Þ →∞ =cgð Þ d p . The resulting wave height is shown in
Figure 2.26, together with the shallow-water approximation.
2.2.6 Superposition of Waves: Wave Spectrum
A real sea state cannot be modeled as a regular wave. Sometimes swells may
almost resemble a regular wave with constant period and amplitude. However,
under the assumption of linearity, wind-generated gravity waves may be
modeled as a summation of regular waves with different wave periods and

wave field may be described by a continuous wave spectrum, or a wave energy
spectrum. In the description of ocean waves, a one-sided spectrum is most com￾monly used, i.e., the spectrum is given for positive frequencies only. Examples of
such spectra are given in Figure 2.27. The wave energy spectrum contains
information of the amplitudes of the wave components, or rather the energy,
as a function of wave frequency. Information of the phase is not present. If
the continuous spectrum is divided into finite frequency intervals,

This means that the area of the spectrum over this frequency interval is
proportional to the energy in a corresponding regular wave component. The
wave spectrum may be obtained from measurements, by taking the Fourier
transform of the measured wave elevation at a specific point in the sea. For
design purposes several standard spectra exist. These are developed to be
representative of typical average sea states. Two frequently used spectral
representations of ocean waves are the Pierson–Moskowitz (PM) spectrum
and the Jonswap spectrum. According to DNV (2021c) the PM spectrum may
be written as:

Here, Hs is the significant wave height. Traditionally this corresponded to the
visually observed wave height but now has a more stringent definition related to
the energy in the sea state or the area of the wave spectrum (see text following
[2.67]). Sometimes, the significant wave height has also been directly related to the
time history of the wave record and denoted H1=3, which is the average of the 1/3
highest waves (double amplitudes) in the sea state (World Meteorological
Organization, 2018). ωp ¼ 2π=Tp is the peak angular frequency of the spectrum
with corresponding period Tp (see Figure 2.27). A wave spectrum is defined for a

the shape of the spectrum are constant over time. As sea states are always changing
as a response to the weather, a truly stationary sea state cannot exist. However, for
design purposes, one normally considers a sea state to be stationary for 3 h. The PM
spectrum is considered a reasonable description of a fully developed sea state, i.e.,
when the wind has been blowing for a long time with constant strength and
direction over a large sea area (fetch). A more realistic assumption is that the sea
is under development and that the fetch is limited. For such cases the Jonswap
spectrum is a reasonable description. The Jonswap spectrum is an γ-adjusted
version of the PM spectrum:

factor. Normally σa ¼ 0:07 and σb ¼ 0:09 are used. An average value of γ is 3.3;
however, values in the range γ ¼ ½1; 5 may be encountered. γ ¼ 1 corresponds to
the PM spectrum. In Figure 2.27 (right), a Jonswap spectrum is illustrated using
different γ-values.

frequency f02 ¼ 1=T02 and energy mean frequency f01 ¼ m0=ð2πm1Þ ¼ 1=T01
are shown. The energy mean period is the period of a regular wave with the same flux
of energy as the mean flux of energy in the the wave spectrum, assuming deep water.
The term “narrow-banded” can be understood in the sense that the wave
elevation record, and thus the wave spectrum, is narrow-banded if there is
only one maximum or minimum value (wave crest or wave trough) between
every crossing of the average value. On the contrary, a broad-banded process
has several maxima and minima between every crossing to the average value.
The Offshore Environment 59
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University PressThis is the case when small, short waves ride on top of long, large waves.
Figure 2.28 shows an example of a realization of the wave spectrum in
Figure 2.27 (left). The time history is obtained by using a fast Fourier
transform of the wave spectrum, using about 1000 frequency components
with random phases in the range 0 – 2 Hz. It is observed that the “narrow￾band” criterion of only one extremum between each zero-crossing is almost
fulfilled. To illustrate a broad-banded process, the rectangular spectrum in
Figure 2.29 is used. A realization of a time history based upon this spectrum
is shown in Figure 2.30. Here, several extreme values are observed between
each zero-crossing. More details on spectral formulation and stochastic pro￾cesses may be found in, e.g., Naess and Moan (2013).
In the above description of the waves, it is assumed that all wave compo￾nents are progressing in the same direction. However, within the framework
of linearity, a summation of wave components progressing in different
directions works as well. We then obtain so-called “short-crested”
waves. A common way of writing the directional wave spectrum is by
introducing a directional weight function, i.e., the wave spectrum is writ￾ten as:

may have s > 15. Examples of the directional spreading function are shown in
Figure 2.31. In the above formulation of the directional spreading, all wave compo￾nents get the same directional spreading. This is normally not the case in real seas.
Thus, a more realistic formulation is to introduce frequency-dependent spreading, i.e.,
D ¼ Dð Þ χ; ω . To find a proper function suitable for design is, however, a challenge.
2.2.7 Wave Kinematics in Irregular Waves
When estimating wave kinematics, particle velocities and accelerations, in an
irregular sea, we may as a first approximation use linear superposition, as for the
wave elevation. This works well below the mean free surface level. However,
above the mean free surface level we have a challenge as linear theory is not
valid here. Several engineering approaches exist for how to estimate the wave
kinematics in wave crests. It is of particular importance to have good estimates on
the velocities in the water under the highest wave crests. These velocities may in
many cases determine the extreme loads on marine structures. Thus, to obtain

three methods are frequently used for estimating kinematics in wave crests
(NORSOK, 2017).
• Wheeler stretching
• Second-order kinematic models
• CFD techniques
Which method to use depends upon the accuracy required in the estimates as well
as the design conditions to be considered. Wheeler stretching is frequently used in
engineering applications as the method is simple and it is straightforward to
implement. The method is based on the assumption that a wave elevation record
is available, e.g., from measurements. The idea is to use the sum of the linear
velocities from each spectral component, “re-computed” using a water depth from
the actual free surface dʹ ¼ d þ ζ. The computed velocities are assumed valid from
the actual free surface level downwards. The principle is illustrated in Figure 2.32.
Using direct extrapolation of the linear velocity profile above the mean surface
level will usually overestimate the fluid velocities, in particular for the short wave
components. In steep waves the Wheeler stretching method may underestimate the
fluid velocities.
More consistent methods based upon second-order perturbations have been
developed; see, e.g., Stansberg (2011) and Johannessen (2011). Birknes et al.
(2013) have compared various approaches. In general, all such perturbation
approaches tend to fail for very steep waves. Methods based upon second-order
perturbations also have limited applicability in shallow water. Thus, for very steep
waves and shallow water, methods using computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
techniques or model testing seem to be the most appropriate approaches to obtain
proper wave kinematics. However, to study the local kinematics in steep, breaking
waves, methods based upon potential theory have also been developed. For

upon potential theory to compute the development of steep, breaking waves. The
method assumes a train of equal waves and breaks down when the wave crest hits
the free surface. Results from the method are illustrated in Figure 2.33. The
computations indicate maximum fluid velocities in the crest beyond the phase
velocity of the wave and accelerations in excess of the acceleration due to gravity.
2.3 Wave Statistics
In wave statistics a distinction is made between short- and long-term statistics.
Short-term statistics assumes a stationary sea state, i.e., all statistical parameters
are constant in the period considered. The process is also assumed to be ergodic.
In ocean wave applications the definition of “short-term” frequently is in the
range of 1–3 h. The period chosen is often a compromise between the stationarity
of the sea state and the require length to achieve proper response statistics of the
structure considered.
Long-term statistics considers the statistics of key parameters as significant wave
height and mean zero-crossing period over time intervals of month to many years.

During a short period of time, the wave condition may be considered stationary.
Assuming stationarity, adhering to the linearity assumption and assuming a narrow￾banded process, some simple statistics may be derived for the wave heights. We
may assume that the surface elevation is represented by a Gaussian process. The
statistics of wave heights (trough to crest) may then be modeled by a Rayleigh
distribution, see Figure 2.34, i.e.:
PHð Þ¼ h 1  e

 2

Here, PHð Þh is the cumulative probability of the wave height, being less than h. αH
is a parameter related to the spectral width, for an infinitely narrow-band process

spectrum with γ ¼ 3:3 the value of ρ is obtained as −0.73 (DNV, 2021c). Næss
(1985) finds that for most sea states with some severity and without significant
swell, 0:75 < ρ <  0:65; see Næss and Moan (2013).
During a period of time t (e.g., 3 h), the number of waves passing a fixed point is
N ¼ t=T02. If the random process is repeated many times, and assuming a narrow￾banded Rayleigh distribution, the mean values of the maxima in each of the
repeated records will tend toward :

Thus, if we have a wave condition with zero up-crossing period T02 ¼ 10 s,
then 1080 waves will pass during a period of 3 h. The most probably largest
wave during a realization will then be 1:87Hs, while the average maximum
wave during several realizations will be 1:95Hs. Care should be shown in
using the Rayleigh distribution in shallow water. Here, the wave height will
typically be limited to 0.78 times the water depth and the tail of the distribu￾tion will be distorted. Alternative distributions for the wave heights exists for
shallow water; see, e.g., DNV (2021c).
The Offshore Environment 65
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University PressFor many applications it is more important to have a good estimate of the
extreme crest height rather than the wave height. The Forristall distribution may
be used for that purpose (DNV 2021c).
2.3.1.1 Confidence Limits for Short-Term Extreme Values
In analyzing wave time series, very often the extreme value is of interest. It is
therefore of interest to estimate the confidence limit of an extreme value obtained
from a single realization of a process, either by measurement or simulation. This
can be done as follows.
Assume a narrow-band process, x tð Þ, with zero mean, i.e., there is only one
positive peak between every zero up-crossing. The peaks are denoted xa and are
assumed independent, i.e., there is no correlation between two neighboring
peaks. The cumulative distribution of peaks is denoted Pð Þ¼ ξ probðxa < ξÞ. As
the peaks are assumed independent, the probability of having N peaks less than ξ is
given by:
prob xð Þ a1; xa2; ... ; xaN < ξ ¼ ½Pð Þ ξ N: ½2:73

Confidence Limits for Maximum Values
Assume the amplitude distribution obeys the Rayleigh distribution. Set ε ¼ 0:05 and
assume the number of oscillations to be N = 200. The 100ð1  2εÞ ¼ 90-percentile
interval is thus given from the probability levels:
P ξ1 ð Þ¼ ε1=N ¼ 0:051=200 ¼ 0:98510 ¼ α1

Following the procedure above, the confidence limit for the exponential distribu￾tion is found from:

In Figure 2.35, the most probable maximum amplitudes and the corresponding
90th-percentile interval for a Rayleigh and an exponential distribution are shown. It
is clearly observed that the exponential process has higher expected extreme values
as well as a larger confidence interval.
2.3.2 Long-Term Wave Statistics
Assume that during a long period of time, say, one year, the wave conditions may be
described by a large number of stationary wave conditions of duration, for example,
of 3 h. Each of these stationary conditions may be characterized by key spectral
parameters such as significant wave height and spectral peak period. Each of the 3 h
periods are assumed independent. In an average year, there will be 2922 such

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University Pressperiods. To present the long-term statistics of the key wave parameters, a “scatter
diagram” is frequently used, as illustrated in Table 2.4. The data are based upon
approximately 18 years of measured data, altogether 52 365 wave records. The
measured significant wave heights are grouped in bins of 0.5 m and the peak periods
are grouped in bins of 1 s. The numbers given in the scatter diagram are the number
of observations within each Hs  Tp bin combination. The marginal and cumulative
probability with respect to Hs and Tp are given along the edges of the table. For
these specific data the yearly average Hs is obtained as 2.77 m and the yearly
average Tp is 9.52 s. It is also observed that the most probable value (the mode) of
the significant wave height and the peak period are both lower than the correspond￾ing average values. This illustrates the skewness in the probability distributions.
The scatter diagram in Table 2.4 includes all wave directions. For design purposes,
such diagrams are frequently made for several wave directions, typically 12 wave
sectors, each of 30 deg.
In the design of marine structures, extreme value estimates are needed. This may
be either the extreme wave height independent of spectral peak period or the
extreme wave height given a spectral peak period.
For the long-term distribution of the significant wave height, a three-parameter
Weibull distribution may be used. The cumulative probability using the three￾parameter Weibull distribution may be written in the form:
PHsðhÞ ¼ 1  exp  h  γ
α
 β " #: ½2:79
αð Þ > 0 is the scale parameter, used to normalize the variable; γð ≤ hÞ is the location
parameter, used to define a lower threshold for the variable; and βð Þ > 0 is the shape
parameter, defining the shape of the distribution. Consider periods of duration of
3 h. If we want to estimate the significant wave height that is exceeded once every
Nth year, the probability level we are seeking, the target probability, is given by:
PN ¼ 24
3  365:25  N
 1
¼ N 1
i : ½2:80
Here, the first factor is the number of 3 h data points per day and 365.25 is the
average number of days per year. Using the three-parameter Weibull distribution,
the significant wave height that is expected to on average be exceeded once every
Nth year is now given by:
HsN ¼ γ þ α lnð Þ Ni
 1=β
: ½2:81
The Offshore Environment 69
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University PressIn estimating the parameters in the Weibull distribution, all the available data are
used. However, it is frequently observed that the tail of the distribution, represent￾ing the highest waves, deviates slightly from the distribution obtained using the
complete dataset. Therefore, in estimating the extreme value for a long period of
time, e.g., 50 years, two other methods are frequently employed: the annual
maximum (AM) method and the peak over threshold (POT) method.
In the AM method, only the largest significant wave height measured every year
is used in the statistical distribution. The data are fitted to a Gumbel distribution in
the form:
PHse ðheÞ ¼ exp exp  he  μ
σ
    : ½2:82
Here, he is the distribution of the yearly extreme significant wave height; μ is the
location parameter; and σ is the scale parameter. The significant wave height
expected to be exceeded once every Nth year is now given by:
HsN ¼ μ  σ ln ln 1  1
N

      : ½2:83
To obtain a reliable extreme value estimate by the AM method, data for many years
are needed.
The POT method represents an alternative. Here, all measured significant
wave heights above a certain threshold are used to establish the extreme value
distribution. Thus, many values per year may enter the distribution without
accounting for all the small Hs . A basic assumption in this approach is that
all Hs entering the distribution are independent, i.e., they do not belong to the
same storm event. A key issue related to the POT method is the choice of
threshold. The choice of an excessively high threshold leads to few data
entering into the distribution, causing greater uncertainty in the estimates
than for the AM method. Choosing a threshold that is too low leads to a lot
of low wave heights entering the distribution, introducing a possible bias to
the extremes, in the same way as for the Weibull approach.
Details related to the use of the methods are found in, for example, Orimolade et
al. (2016) and Naess and Moan (2013).
In Figures 2.36 and 2.37, the significant wave heights in the northern North Sea
from measurements over a period of about 18 years are presented. The measure￾ments are taken once every third hour. The stars are the distribution based upon
binned data. 100 bins are used. The solid line is the fitted three-parameter Weibull
distribution. The logarithmic scaling in Figure 2.37 is introduced to obtain a linear
70 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.003 Published online by Cambridge University Pressrelation between the two axes for large Hs values. By this scaling it is also possible
to read out the wave heights corresponding to low probability of exceedance.
Long-Term Extreme Value
Find an estimate on the 3 h significant wave height expected to be exceeded once every
Nth year. The aim is thus to find a wave height with probability of exceedance equal to
1/(N*8760/3). The significant wave height that is expected to be exceeded once during a
period of 50 years corresponds to cumulative probability level of Hs equal to 1-1/
146000. On the Weibull scale this becomeslnðln 1ð ÞÞ ¼ =146000 2:4758. Using [2.81]
and the distribution fitted to the data in Figure 2.36, the corresponding 50-year extreme

Wind Energy and Wind Loads
This chapter outlines the principles for extracting wind energy, with a focus on
horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWT) as these are the most common offshore
wind turbines. How much energy is it possible to extract from such a turbine? This
question is addressed by classical, simplified momentum considerations. It is also
shown that when energy is extracted, consequential wind forces, or thrust forces,
are acting on the turbine. The structure supporting the wind turbine must be
designed to withstand these forces.
Having established an upper limit for the available power, the next question to
address is how it can be achieved. Lifting surfaces as used for airplanes have shown
themselves to also be the most efficient principle to extract power from wind
turbines. The basic principles for two-dimensional (2D) lifting surfaces are thus
addressed. The 2D lifting surface, or aerofoil, together with the momentum theory
is the starting point for the most common way of computing the power output and
forces on a HAWT, through the beam element momentum (BEM) method.
Wind turbines have increased in size over the years, with turbines with diameters
of greater than 200 m now becoming common offshore. This introduces new
challenges to the design of the turbines; understanding the time-dependent loads
in a turbulent wind field and three-dimensional (3D) flow effects is essential. To
understand the basics of the time-dependent load effects, the 2D aerofoil is con￾sidered, while both time-dependent loads and 3D effects are efficiently described
by using vortex methods. Vortex methods also constitute an intermediate step
between the simple BEM method and time-consuming computational fluid dynam￾ics (CFD) methods.
The power characteristic of a modern HAWT is discussed in some detail and
compared to idealized turbines.
In principle, as much energy as possible should be extracted from a wind turbine.
However, at high wind speeds, the available power is too large for the electrical

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University Pressgenerator. Therefore, efficient control systems are required, both to maximize the
power extraction at low wind speeds and to limit the power extraction at high wind
speeds.
3.1 The Betz Theory
Consider a flow of air in x-direction with constant speed U and a virtual stream tube
with axis in the flow direction. The air is flowing in and out through the end surfaces
and no flow is crossing the cylindrical surface. The cross-sectional area is A (see
Figure 3.1). For a body with mass m the kinetic energy may be expressed as
E ¼ ð Þ 1=2 mU2. The mass crossing A during a time interval dt is m ¼ ρAU dt.
The power in the air crossing the surface A is the time derivative of the energy
and obtained as:
P ¼ dE
dt ¼ 1
2
dm
dt U2 ¼ 1
2
ρAU3
: ½3:1
The power in the air flow is thus proportional to the third power of the wind
speed.
How much of this power may be extracted? By considering the cross-section A,
the following observations are made. If all the kinetic energy is extracted, the flow
will have to stop, and the air will thus “pile” up in front of A. This is not possible.
Similarly, if the wind speed is the same on both sides of the tube, the kinetic energy is
the same at both sides of the tube, and no power is extracted. To find an answer to the
question about maximum possible power extraction, some simplifications are made.
The flow is assumed to be ideal and incompressible; thus, the density of the air is the
same in the whole flow volume considered and no viscous losses are present. The
flow is considered steady and unidirectional, thus any radial flow components are
ignored. Assume now a virtual “actuator disc” is inserted into the stream tube at
location A1 (see Figure 3.2). The actuator disc is assumed to extract power from
the flow. As power is extracted by the disc, the flow speed will be reduced,
which again means that a force will act on the disc. The fluid volume between
a cross-section far upstream, at A0, and a cross-section far downstream, at A2, is

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University Pressconsidered. The streamlines limiting the volume in radial direction are such that the
mass flow through all cross-sections is equal. To study the flow, three basic conser￾vation relations are considered: the conservation of mass, the conservation of
momentum and the conservation of energy.
As there is no flow through the sides of the stream tube, the conservation of mass
implies that the mass flux through all cross-sections of the stream tube is equal:
dm
dt ¼ U0ρA0 ¼ U1ρA1 ¼ U2ρA2: ½3:2
Here, the density is equal at all cross-sections as the flow is assumed to be
incompressible.
The conservation of momentum in the stream tube implies that the change of
momentum in the fluid volume considered must equal the forces acting on the
volume. In the present 1D case the change in momentum is given from the difference
in momentum between the flow into the stream tube and out of the stream tube:
T ¼ dMx
dt ¼ dm
dt ð Þ¼ U0  U2 ρA1U1ð Þ U0  U2 : ½3:3
Here, T is the thrust acting from the fluid on the actuator disc. This is assumed to be
the only axial force acting on the fluid volume. (One may add a correction to the
thrust by accounting for the axial component of the pressure acting on the expand￾ing part of the stream tube. This is, however, not done in the classical derivation of
the Betz theory.) Mx is the momentum of the fluid in the x direction.
The conservation of energy is expressed by the Bernoulli equation. As a force is
supposed to act on the actuator disc, there will be a pressure jump at this location.
The Bernoulli equation must thus be applied separately upstream and downstream
of the actuator disc:

actuator disc respectively. Far away from the disc, the pressure is equal to
the pressure in the ambient flow, i.e., p2 ¼ p0. The development of the pressure
in the stream tube is illustrated in Figure 3.3. Integrating the pressure jump over the

It is observed that the power extracted from the fluid is the total power in the
incident flow multiplied by a power coefficient, CP. The power coefficient is given
from the induction factor. The maximum possible power extraction is found by
considering dP=da. dP=da ¼ 0 is obtained for a ¼ 1=3. This corresponds to
a maximum value of P. Inserting this value for the induction factor in the expres￾sions for the thrust and the power, the following values are obtained for the power
and thrust coefficients:
CP max ¼ CP;a¼1=3 ¼ 16
27
≃ 0:59
CT;a¼1=3 ¼ 8
9 :
½3:10
This maximum value for the power coefficient is called the “Betz limit,” after Betz
(1926). It should be noted that this limit is derived without any assumptions related
to how the power extraction is performed. It is assumed that the power extraction
reduces the axial velocity only and no energy is used to set the fluid into rotation.
The issue of rotation is discussed below. It is also observed that the slow-down of
the fluid takes place both in front of and behind the actuator disc. Actually,
according to [3.6], half of the speed reduction has taken place as the fluid passes
the actuator disc. The reduction of the wind speed upstream of the actuator disc is
frequently denoted as an induction effect.
In Figure 3.4, the power and thrust coefficients are plotted as functions of the
axial induction factor. The ratio between the upstream and downstream fluid
velocities is also included. It is observed that the downstream velocity becomes
negative if a > 0:5. Thus, for a > 0:5 the flow is reversed, and the initial assumption
of a stream tube is violated. The present assumptions and derivation are thus not
valid as the induction factor approaches 0.5 and beyond.
3.2 Including the Effect of Wake Rotation
In deriving the Betz limit, it was assumed that only the flow in the x direction was
of importance. However, for a HAWT the power is extracted from the wind by
generating torque in the rotor. This torque must, considering the conversation of
momentum, be balanced by a rotational motion in the fluid. A classical way of
Wind Energy and Wind Loads 81

area through the rotor plane, as illustrated in Figure 3.5. Within the annulus,
continuity of the flow in axial direction requires:

upstream, at the turbine and far downstream. r is the radius of the annulus, dr is the
thickness and ux is the axial velocity component in the annulus.1
Let ur and uθ denote the radial and azimuthal velocity components in the annulus
respectively. ω ¼ uθ=r is then the angular velocity of the fluid in the annulus
considered. In this classical approach, it is assumed that the azimuthal velocity
jumps from zero to uθ1þ at the rotor disk (Burton et al., 2011). Continuity of
momentum of the rotational fluid motion, the angular momentum, just behind the
rotor and far downstream, requires that uθ1þr1 ¼ uθ2r2, or ω1r2
1 ¼ ω2r2
2, as there are
no rotational forces acting on the fluid between these two sections and no exchange
of momentum between the annuli are assumed. The torque acting on the rotor
section from r to r þ dr must equal the change in angular momentum in the annulus
of fluid considered. The angular momentum of a mass m of fluid in the annulus is
given by:
L ¼ mωr
2
: ½3:12
Consider the change in angular momentum from a far-upstream section to a section
far downstream. The torque on the rotor is given by the time derivative of the
angular momentum. At the upstream section, the azimuthal velocity is zero, and the
torque may thus be written:
dQ ¼ dL

As can be observed from these equations, the radial velocity component ur is
included at the rotor plane, while this component is assumed to be zero in the far￾upstream and far-downstream sections. Further, it is assumed, from continuity
arguments, that the axial and radial velocity components are equal on both sides
of the rotor plane, while there is a jump in the rotational velocity. In the Betz theory
it was assumed that p0 ¼ p2. Due to the rotational velocity component, this is not

Δp ¼ p1  p1þ is the pressure jump over the rotor disc in the annular section
considered. Consider now the pressure jump over the rotor disc by using
a coordinate system following the rotation of the rotor (see, e.g., Manwell,
McGowan and Rogers, 2009; Burton et al., 2011; Kramm et al., 2016). Just in
front of the rotor the fluid is assumed to have zero rotation, while just behind the
rotor plane the fluid has angular velocity ω1. As seen from the rotor, the angular
velocities of the fluid are Ω and Ω þ ω1 respectively. Ω is the angular velocity of the
rotor and the plus sign appears because the rotation in the fluid is opposite to the
rotor rotation according to the conservation of angular momentum. The Bernoulli
equation relative to the rotating blades can then be written as:

The pressure far downstream is thus related to the rotational velocity in the
fluid as well as the turbine rotor velocity. Within the above framework, an
exact solution for the thrust and power can be obtained if it is assumed that
the circulation is confined to the axis of the wake. In that case we obtain
ω1r2
1 ¼ ω2r2
2 (as already has been assumed above) and independent of the radius. It
can then also be deduced that the axial velocity in the wake is independent of the
radius, similar to in the axial actuator disc approach (for details, see Kramm et al.,
2016).
The classical approach used is now to equate the thrust obtained from [3.16] to
the thrust from the axial momentum approach of [3.8]. A relation between the axial
and angular induction is thereby obtained, i.e.:

induction. This corresponds to the speed ratio going toward infinity. As the axial
induction factor is reduced toward 0.25, the optimum angular induction tends to
infinity and corresponds to zero speed ratio (see Figure 3.6 (left)). From Figure 3.6

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press(right), it is observed that for speed ratios above 2, the optimum axial induction
factor is very close to the Betz limit of 1/3, and that the angular induction becomes
very small. This is justifying the frequently used assumption of zero angular
induction at speed ratios above approximately 6.
In conjunction with [3.17] relating the upstream and downstream pressures, it
was mentioned that if the circulation is confined to the axis of the wake, ω2r2
2 is
independent of radius. This assumption has as a consequence that the axial induc￾tion factor also is equal for all radii. If the tip speed ratio is above approximately 6,
a local speed ratio below 2 will be present for the inner third of the rotor only, i.e., an
optimum axial induction factor of 1/3 for all annular sections is a reasonable
assumption.
Using the above optimum relation between the axial and angular induction
factors for each radii, the maximum power coefficient for the full rotor may be
computed from [3.23]. This is called the “Glauert limit” for the power coeffi￾cient, after Glauert (1935). In Figure 3.7 the maximum power coefficient
according to the Betz limit and the Glauert limit is plotted as a function of
the tip speed ratio. For tip speed ratios above 6, the difference is less than 2%.
The Glauert limit may be considered to be the limit for a rotor with an infinite
number of blades and no viscous losses. A rotor with a finite number of
blades has a lower theoretical maximum power. The fewer the blades, the
lower the maximum. The maximum obtained depends upon the assumed
circulation distribution along the radius of the blades; for a further discussion,
see Kramm et al. (2016).

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press3.3 Two-Dimensional Lifting Surfaces
Above, it was assumed that the power is extracted from the air by a device rotating
about a horizontal axis. To generate the necessary torque to drive the rotor, the
principle of lifting surfaces is used. This is the same principle as used for airplane
wings. In this section some of the basic concepts for two-dimensional (2D) lifting
surfaces are described. For example, in the beam element momentum (BEM)
method for computing the loads on a wind turbine, the assumption of a local 2D
flow over the rotor blades is used. The BEM method is discussed in more detail in
Section 3.4. For more details about 2D lifting surface theory, the reader should visit
the special literature on aero- or hydrodynamics, e.g., Newman (1977) and
Bramwell, Done and Balmford (2001).
A 2D aerofoil has a layout as illustrated in Figure 3.8. The straight line from the
leading edge (front) to the trailing edge (tail) is denoted the chord. The line from
the leading edge to the trailing edge representing the mean line between the upper
surface and the lower surface is denoted as the camber line. For a symmetric
aerofoil this line coincides with the chord. For most aerofoils, the front of the foil
is rounded to secure a smooth flow around the foil. The trailing edge, however, is
sharp. This is essential to the working principle of an aerofoil. Figure 3.10 illus￾trates the flow direction towards the aerofoil and the corresponding lift and drag
forces. In the 2D steady flow case the lift force is perpendicular to the incident flow
and the drag force is zero under ideal flow conditions.
Figure 3.9 illustrates the streamlines of an ideal flow, without viscous effects, around
an aerofoil. The incident flow hits the foil close to the leading edge and splits into two
flows, above and beneath the foil. These two flows meet at the trailing edge, which
becomes a common separation point. According to the Kutta–Joukowski theorem, the
joined flow should leave the trailing edge in a smooth manner. The force acting on the
aerofoil can be derived from a local perspective or a global perspective. In the local
perspective, it is observed that the flow at the upper side of the foil must move a longer
distance and thus faster than the flow on the lower side. The pressure on the upper side
is thus lower than on the lower side and a net upward force is created. In the global
perspective, we observe that the foil gives the flow a small change in direction; a small

a vertical momentum is introduced to the flow, which must be balanced by an opposite￾directed vertical force on the foil.
If it were not for the sharp trailing edge forcing the upper and lower streams to
join here, the ideal flow theory (potential theory) would predict a separation point at
the upper side of the foil with zero force in vertical and horizontal directions in
a stationary flow as a result, according to d’Alembert’s paradox.
If the stream was not forced to separate at the trailing edge, the flow potential
could be modeled by a source distribution along the camber line. The integral of the
source distribution would be zero. Thus, the source distribution causes a local
disturbance of the incident flow only. Far away from the foil, the disturbance
vanishes. However, without the Kutta-Joukowski condition, the flow at the trailing
edge becomes unphysical. This is illustrated in Figure 3.13 and discussed further in
the following.

Joukowski condition at the trailing edge. The dashed streamline marks the division

So far, the lift force has been explained by considering the flow and the effect of the
trailing edge; the Kutta-Joukowski condition requires the flows from the two sides
of the foil to join at the trailing edge and leave the foil smoothly.
The lift force can, however, also be derived in a more theoretical way. Assume
a 2D incompressible and ideal flow that can be described by a velocity potential.
Consider a closed curve S in the fluid. The circulation in the flow, Γ is obtained by
considering the line integral of the tangential fluid velocity along this curve:
Γ ¼ ∮
S
Usds: ½3:28
Here, Us is the velocity tangential to the curve S. We use a coordinate system with x
in the direction of the free flow and y positive upward, then a positive rotation of
a vortex, using the “right-hand rule” will induce a negative x-velocity above and
a positive x-velocity below the vortex, as indicated in Figure 3.11. In a potential
flow, Γ ¼ 0 everywhere except when a singularity of vortex type is located inside
the closed curve S. If a point vortex of strength Γ is present in the fluid, the
tangential velocity at a radius r induced by the vortex becomes as follows, accord￾ing to the Biot–Savart law:
Us ¼ Γ
2πr
: ½3:29
Consider now a circular cylinder with radius r inserted into a steady incident flow
with velocity U0, as illustrated in Figure 3.11. According to potential theory, the
tangential velocity component of the incident flow along the cylinder surface is
given by:

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University PressHere, a positive tangential velocity has the same direction as the direction of
a positive vortex. This result can be derived by modeling the cylinder by a dipole
in the incident flow. If we insert a vortex of strength Γ in the center of the cylinder,
the corresponding induced velocities are given from [3.29]. The total velocity at the
cylinder surface is tangential and given by the sum of the two contributions. The
difference in pressure at the surface and the far field is thus obtained as:
Δp ¼ ρ

Consider now the pressure difference between two points at the cylinder surface,
one located at ðR; βÞ, the other at ðR; βÞ:

The lift force is thus given from the product of the free flow velocity and the vortex
strength. This result is valid more generally, and is applied in vortex methods, to
compute the lift force on aerofoils. The result for the cylinder may also be used
directly by mapping the cylinder into the shape of an aerofoil by conformal
mapping; see, e.g., Benson (1996). By the above approach, it can be shown that
in a steady, 2D flow, the force in the direction of the free flow, the drag force, is zero.
However, this is not the case in time-dependent flow, 3D flow or when the effect of
viscosity is included.
3.3.2 Two-Dimensional Aerofoils
For a general-shaped 2D aerofoil in ideal flow, the flow around the foil and the
corresponding lift force can be computed by distributing vortices and sources along
the camber line of the foil. Frequently, linearized foil theory is used for this purpose. In
linearized foil theory (see, e.g., Newman, 1977; Faltinsen, 2005), it is assumed that the
induced velocities due to the presence of the foil are small compared to the incident
flow velocity. This implies also that the thickness to chord length ratio must be small.
Following the derivation in Faltinsen (2005), we may denote the upper and lower
surface of the foil by yuð Þx and ylð Þx respectively (see Figure 3.12). The velocity

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University Presspotential due to the presence of the foil is denoted ϕð Þ x; y . Consider now a steady fluid
flow in an infinite fluid. The boundary condition for the potential is given from the
zero normal flow condition, i.e.:
∂ϕ

We may write:
∂ϕ
∂n ¼ n1
∂ϕ
∂x
þ n2
∂ϕ
∂y
: ½3:35
Except for close to the leading edge (and at the trailing edge), the x-component of
the surface normal is much smaller than the y-component, justifying the approxi￾mation n1≃ ± ∂yu=l=∂x on the upper and lower foil surface respectively. Again,
under the assumption of jn1j≪jn2j, we have that n1 ≃ ± ∂yu=l=∂x on the upper and
lower surface. From [3.34] the following is thus obtained:

The linearization now implies that the chord is transformed to a straight line along
the x-axis. The foil extends from x ¼ c=2 to x ¼ c=2. Further, by a Tailor expan￾sion of ∂ϕ=∂y about y ¼ 0, the boundary condition in [3.36] is satisfied on y ¼ 0þ=
rather than on y ¼ yu=l.
As the camber line is the midline between the lower and upper surface, it is
defined by:

The potential describing the flow around the foil is split into a symmetric and an
antisymmetric part, ϕs and ϕa, satisfying the following boundary conditions at the
foil, between x ¼ c=2 and x ¼ c=2:

½3:39
The symmetric part of the potential represents a source distribution along the
camber line and accounts for the thickness distribution of the foil. The antisymmet￾ric part accounts for the slope of the camber line. This part of the solution can be
represented by a vortex distribution.
From [3.39] it is observed that the source and vortex distribution along the
camber line is obtained from the local thickness gradient and local camber line
gradient only. This is due to the linearization, involving that the boundary condi￾tions are satisfied on y ¼ 0. I.e., a source at a certain x position contributes to
vertical velocities on the foil at this x location only. Similarly, a vortex at a certain
x position contributes to x velocities only at that position on the foil. However,
the vortex distribution induces y components of the velocity all along the foil. In
the more general case (see the description of the boundary element method in
Section 3.4), one has to consider that any source and vortex will induce velocities at
any part of the body surface, thus involving boundary-integral methods to solve for
the source and vortex strength.
Integrating the source distribution along the camber line, the result is zero. Thus,
the source distribution causes a local disturbance of the incident flow only. Far
away from the foil, the disturbance vanishes. The Kutta–Joukowski condition at the
trailing edge is not satisfied by the source distribution and the flow will not leave the
trailing edge in a smooth manner.
Adding the antisymmetric part of the solution, the vortex distribution along the
camber line is obtained. The Kutta–Joukowski condition is used to obtain a unique
Wind Energy and Wind Loads 93
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University Presssolution. The requirement imposed is that the flow shall leave the trailing edge
tangential to the chord line at the training edge. The solution involves singular
integral equations (see Newman, 1977; Faltinsen, 2005). The impact of the vortex
distribution on the flow is illustrated in Figure 3.13 (bottom). It should also be noted
that the vortex distribution causes the flow, which initially is in the positive x￾direction, to obtain a small velocity component in the negative y-direction behind
the foil. This change of momentum in the flow has its counterpart in a force in
positive y-direction on the foil: the lift force.
It may be considered strange that a physical lift force can be modeled by introdu￾cing a distribution of vortices that represents mathematical singularities. It is, how￾ever, important to note that the circulation set up by this vortex distribution exists
physically. The boundary layer around the foil creates a circulation so that the Kutta–
Joukowski condition is fulfilled. Faltinsen (2005) discusses this issue in more detail.
The relation between the velocity potential and a circulation distribution along
the line x ¼ ½c=2; c=2, y ¼ 0 can be written as:

a0 is thus an expression for the angle of the chord line, or angle of attack,
while a1 is a weighted average camber of the foil. As for the example above,

The moment is as for the flat plate. From [3.49] it is observed that in this case the
zero lift force is obtained for a negative angle of attack. The vortex distribution over
the parabolic foil at zero angle of attack is shown in Figure 3.15.
The above linear, ideal flow solution of the flow around a 2D foil is useful in
understanding the basic principles of how an aerofoil works. The approach also
provides reasonable results for small angles of attack for real foils when the flow
separation satisfies the Kutta–Joukowski condition. In the real case, separation may
take place at the suction side forward of the leading edge and the lift coefficient may
be very sensitive to the Reynolds number of the flow, i.e., the viscous effects
become important.
In Figure 3.16, typical lift and drag coefficients for a real aerofoil with camber are
shown. The lift coefficient at zero angle of attack is thus different from zero. The dotted
line shows the lift coefficient corresponding to CL ¼ 2πα þ 0:6, with α in radians.
The addition of 0.6 is to ease the comparison with the typical lift curve. The slope of the
lift curve for real aerofoils is normally close to this value for small angles of attack.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University PressFor greater angles of attack, flow separation from the suction side starts, and the lift
curve flattens out and may even decay. This phenomenon is called stalling. Separation
effects are very sensitive to the Reynolds number. For small angles of attack, the drag
forces are very small, with a drag coefficient typically less than 0.05. As flow separation
starts, a significant increase in drag will occur. The drag coefficient is even more
sensitive to the Reynolds number and surface roughness than the lift coefficient. In
the design of aerofoils for wind rotor blades, low drag is an important criterion.
In a real operational case, the angle of attack will vary over time. If, in a dynamic
case, the angle of attack is moving from the attached flow region into the stall
region, there may be some delay in the stalling process, meaning that the lift in the
dynamic case accepts some higher angle of attack than in the stationary case. On the
other hand, if separation has first taken place, and the angle of attack is reduced,
there may be a significant delay compared to the stationary case before the attached
flow again is established. This phenomenon is called dynamic stall and is usually
implemented in computational tools for wind turbine dynamics.
3.4 The Blade Element Momentum Method
The blade element momentum (BEM) method is a well-established and commonly
used method for computing the forces acting on a blade as well as the complete
rotor of a wind turbine. The method may be considered as an extension of the

horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWTs) are discussed. However, the method is
also used for vertical-axis turbines. The starting point is the 2D lift and drag
coefficients for an aerofoil, as discussed in the previous section. In most cases
these coefficients are established from experiments, as both a wide range of angles
of attack and reliable estimates on the drag forces are required. The wind turbine
blade is assumed to be composed of a large number of 2D sections, as illustrated in
Figure 3.17. When the blade rotates, each blade section describes an annulus in the
rotor plane (see Figure 3.17). This annulus is used in the momentum considerations.
At the outset, the BEM method rests upon three main assumptions. First, the flow
over each of the blade sections can be assumed to be 2D and independent of the flow
over the neighboring sections. Second, the momentum equations apply within each
annulus for solving for the loads on the blade segment. Third, the flow is stationary.
To account for deviations from these assumptions, several corrections are usually
introduced, e.g.: correcting for tip and hub vortices (violating the 2D flow assump￾tion); correcting for nonstationary flow conditions; correcting for large induction
factors; and correcting for the incident flow not being perpendicular to the rotor
plane. Details of the BEM theory as well as practical examples of implementation
are given by, e.g., Moriarty and Hansen (2005) and Hansen (2015). The following is
a short summary of the approach.
Consider an aerofoil section as displayed in Figure 3.18. As the geometry of the
neighboring sections are similar as the one considered, the flow over the section is
assumed to be 2D. The inflow velocity experienced by the foil is composed of the

of the blade in the rotor plane. It is observed that the incident, free wind velocity is
modified due to the axial induction, i.e., the axial velocity as seen by the aerofoil
is U0ð Þ 1  a . Similarly, the air velocity into the foil due to the rotation of the foil is
given by Ωr 1 þ a0 ð Þ. Here, Ω is the angular velocity of the rotor, r is the radius of
the section considered and a0 is the angular induction factor, as discussed in
Section 3.2. In many implementations (see, e.g., Moriarty and Hansen, 2005),
additional velocity components accounting for the local elastic deformation veloci￾ties of the blade are added to the above two velocity components. The angle of
attack is defined as the angle between the incident flow and the chord line and is
denoted α. The angle β is the angle between the chord line and the rotor plane, or the
local pitch of the 2D section. This is given as the sum of the twist of the blade
section, θ, and the blade pitch angle, βb. For most state-of-the-art offshore wind
turbines, the blade pitch angle is varied during operation to control the power
output. The twist, however, is specific to the design of the blade and is introduced
to obtain the wanted angle of attack at the various blade sections. The angle
between the flow and the rotor plane is ϕ. This is given from the two velocity
components:

the NREL 5 MW reference turbine is given (Jonkman et al., 2009). Note that
the twist angle is large close to the hub and decays to almost zero at the tip. From
the table it is also observed that the geometry of the blade sections differs along the

as the blade rotates, both due to the wind shear and turbulence.

used to solve for the sectional forces by iteration. Note that the induction factors
may vary from section to section. Before solving the equations, state-of-the-art
computer programs introduce several corrections to the 2D approach, as mentioned
above, in the text following Figure 3.17 (see, e.g., Moriarty and Hansen, 2005).
A tip-loss model is used to account for the induced velocities due to the tip
vortices. This effect is discussed in more detail below in relation to the 3D vortex

The value of this correction factor is displayed for three different inflow angles in
Figure 3.19. The inflow angle is here assumed to be constant along the blade. The
theoretical background for this correction factor was developed by Prandtl. He
considered the effect of a helical vortex shed from the tip of each blade. It is
observed that the correction depends upon the ratio NB=sinϕ. As the number of
blades increases or the inflow angle is reduced, the strength of the tip vortex is
reduced, and the correction is thus reduced.
As a strong free vortex also will be shed from the hub, a similar correction as for
the tip may be used for the hub correction, replacing R  r with r  Rhub in [3.54].
As discussed in Section 3.1, the Betz theory is not valid for axial induction
factors above 0.5; even for values below this, the accuracy ceases. This condition
occurs for a rotor operating at high rotational speed in a low-incident wind speed.
The so-called “Glauert correction” may be introduced to correct the thrust force as
obtained by the Betz theory at axial induction factors above 0.4. According to the
Betz theory, the thrust coefficient has its maximum value of 1.0 for an axial
induction factor of 0.5 (see Figure 3.4.).Using the Glauert correction, the thrust
coefficient increases almost linearly from a value of 0.96 at a ¼ 0:4 to 2.0 at a ¼ 1.
The Glauert correction was developed for a complete axial actuator disc but is also
applied on each annulus in the BEM approach. The Glauert correction is also
related to the tip-loss factor. For details, see Moriarty and Hansen (2005).

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University PressIf the incident flow is not perpendicular to the rotor plane, a skewed wake
correction should be introduced.
The relations needed to compute the loads on the blades are now established. The
following procedure may be applied to solve for the thrust and power of the rotor.
1) Start with one section of a blade and make an initial estimate on the axial and
angular induction factors a and a0
. A convenient choice may be zero for both.
2) Compute the inflow angle, ϕ, from [3.50] and the local angle of attack,
α ¼ ϕ  β. The pitch angle, β which is the sum of the local twist angle and
blade pitch angle, is input.
3) Find the lift coefficient, CL and CD, from look-up tables. These tables may be
based upon experimental data or 2D numerical analysis.
4) Compute thrust and torque from [3.52].
5) Introduce tip-loss and hub-loss corrections to the computed thrust.
6) New estimates on the axial and angular induction factors a and a0 are computed
by invoking [3.53]. (If after the tip- and hub-loss corrections the thrust coeffi￾cient is above 0.96, the Glauert correction must be used in computing a.)
7) If the values of a and a0 obtained in Step 6 differ from the input values with more
than a set tolerance, estimate new values and repeat from Step 2; otherwise, go
to Step 8.
8) Repeat the above procedure for all sections.
9) Compute final lift and torque distribution for the rotor.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University PressAs mentioned above, the BEM method is widely used in industry due to its computa￾tional efficiency. One should, however, note that the implementations may differ as
various methods for corrections may be applied. Further, as each annual section is
considered independently, the flow conditions between neighboring sections should
not differ much. Differences between neighboring sections will cause radial flow
components not accounted for in the theory. The theory assumes stationary flow.
That implies dynamic effects due to wind shear, turbulence and structural vibrations
are not directly handled by the method. Various corrections are introduced to mitigate
these shortcomings; see, e.g., Hansen et al. (2006) and Leishman and Martin (2002).
3.5 Drag-Based Devices
In the above derivations, the lift force on aerofoils is utilized to extract power from
the wind. Devices utilizing drag forces are frequently proposed for extracting wind
power. However, these are far less efficient than lift-based devices. This is illus￾trated in the following.
Consider a cup anemometer, usually applied for measuring wind speed.
However, assuming it is used for power extraction, the following simplified
considerations may be done. The layout is illustrated in Figure 3.20. It is assumed
that the radius of the cups, Rc, is much smaller than the rotor radius, R. The force on
the cups is governed by drag, i.e., the drag force on each cup is given by:
F ¼ 1
2
ρCDAureljurelj; ½3:55
where urel is the relative velocity between the air and the cup in the tangential
direction of the rotor, urel ¼ ð Þ Ucosθ  ωR . The angular velocity, ω, is assumed
constant. θ ¼ 0 corresponds to the cup in the top position. The drag coefficient will

CD ¼ CD1 for urel > 0 and CD ¼ CD0 for urel < 0, CD1 >CD0. CD1 is the drag coeffi￾cient for flow into the cup.
The drag force acts in the direction of the rotation if urel > 0. This is the case for
ωR < U and when the cup is in the interval θ0 < θ < θ0, θ0 ¼ arccosð Þ ωR=U .
During this part of the revolution, the wind force drives the rotation. If ωR > U,
urel is negative during the complete rotation and no power is extracted.
The instantaneous power extracted from one cup is given by the torque multi￾plied by the angular velocity:
P ¼ FRω: ½3:56
To find the average power production, [3.56] is integrated over one complete
revolution, taking into account the change in drag coefficient as the sign of the
relative velocity changes; i.e., the following expression for the average power from
one cup is obtained:

Here, the “cup speed ratio,” λ ¼ ωR=U, and the “drag ratio,” α ¼ CD0=CD1, are
introduced. For N cups without any interaction, the power is N multiplied by this
value.
In Figure 3.21, the angle for which the drag force changes sign is shown as
a function of the cup speed ratio. It is observed that for a cup speed ratio of zero, the
shift in sign takes place at θ0 ¼ π=2. This angle decreases as λ increases. As λ tends
toward 1, θ0 →0. For λ > 1 there is no change in sign, i.e., the relative velocity is
acting toward the “back side” of the cup all the time.

observed that the system will at most extract about 0.1 times the power available at
a cross-sectional area equal to the projected area of one cup. More realistic values of
the drag coefficients are CD1 ¼ 1:33 and CD0 ¼ 0:34, i.e., α ≃ 0:25. With these
figures, a maximum power coefficient, defined as above, for a four-cup system
becomes about 0.05. This is very low compared to the Betz limit. As the
drag coefficient ratio increases from zero, the maximum power is considerably
reduced.
It is observed that the maximum power is obtained for a rotational speed
that is about half the zero-power speed. The zero-power speed is the speed of
an anemometer with zero rotational resistance. According to Paschen and
Laurat (2014), typical cup speed ratios for standard anemometers with conical
cups are 0.25–0.3, depending upon radius ratio and drag coefficients. Conical
cups have typical drag coefficients of 1.4 and 0.5, corresponding to α ¼ 0:36.
From Figure 3.22, this should correspond to a zero-moment cup speed
ratio of about 0.2, i.e., somewhat lower than reported by Paschen and Laurat
(2014). This may partly be explained by the assumption of small cup radius relative
to the rotor radius used in the present derivation, as well as the assumption that the
driving force depends upon the square of the tangential velocity only.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press3.6 Unsteady Effects
Unsteady effects appear on wind turbines for various reasons. The turbines operate
in an atmospheric boundary layer. This causes the mean wind inflow velocity to
a blade section to vary during one revolution. In addition, the wind field has
turbulent velocity components, causing fluctuations at a wide range of frequencies.
This effect may be enhanced if the turbine is operating in the wake of an upwind
turbine. Due to the control system of the wind turbine, rotational speed as well as
blade pitch angle may vary. Further, dynamic response of the wind turbine, due to
both wind and wave loading, may cause elastic vibrations in the structure as well as
rigid body motions for floating wind turbines.
The following section discusses the effect of transient and harmonic variation in
the inflow condition, or motions of an aerofoil. The discussion is based upon
classical results for 2D foils.
3.6.1 Step Changes: Two-Dimensional Aerofoils
Following Leishman and Martin (2002), four different unsteady effects for a 2D
aerofoil are considered.
Change in angle of attack
Vertical motion of the aerofoil
Time-varying incident flow
Variation in flow velocity normal to the incident flow, due to turbulence
The four cases are illustrated in Figure 3.23. For a blade on a HAWT, the vertical
motion corresponds to variation in the wind speed or motion of the nacelle in axial
direction. Analytical solutions exist for these conditions under ideal flow condi￾tions, i.e., attached flow over the foil with the Kutta–Joukowski condition fulfilled.
Characteristic for all these conditions is that the change in lift force is delayed
relative to the motion of the aerofoil or change in flow condition. The reason for this is
found by considering the lift force as expressed via the circulation; see [3.43]. Consider
an aerofoil sitting in a steady flow at an angle of attack α. The corresponding
circulation around the foil, the “bound vortex,” is Γ. Then, suddenly, the angle
of attack is increased by a value dα. To fulfil the boundary conditions at this new
angle of attack, the bound vortex gets an addition dΓ. As the circulation in the
system must be conserved, a vortex of opposite strength will be shed from trailing
edge and advected downstream (see Figure 3.24). This shed vortex will induce
a downward velocity, vind, on the foil, causing a reduction in the angle of attack. The
modified incident velocity is denoted U0mod in Figure 3.24. As the shed vortex
moves downstream, the induction effect on the incident velocity diminishes, and
108 Offshore Wind Energy

value corresponding to the angle of attack α þ dα.

Wind Energy and Wind Loads 109
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University PressWagner (1925) solved the problem of an indicial2 change in the angle of attack
for a flat plate (see, e.g., Leishman and Martin, 2002; Newman, 1977). This
problem can be shown to be the same as an indicial change in the incident velocity
at a foil at a constant angle of attack. The two problems correspond to case one and
three in Figure 3.23 (numbered from the top). Even if the angle of attack or the
incident velocity perform a step change (is instantaneous), the lift force needs some
time to adjust to the new stationary value. The analytical solution to the change in
lift force is denoted the Wagner solution and may be approximated (Leishman and
Martin, 2002) as:≃):
ΔCLðsÞ
ΔCLðs→ ∞Þ
≃1  0:165e0:091s  0:335e0:6s
: ð3:60Þ
Here, s ¼ Ut=c is the number of chord lengths by which the flow has moved since
the indicial change. ΔCLðsÞ=ΔCLðs→ ∞Þ is the change in lift coefficient relative to
the difference between the new and the previous stationary value. The function is
shown in Figure 3.25. It is observed that half of the change in lift takes place
immediately as the change in angle of attack takes place, but to obtain 90% of the
change corresponding to the new steady-state value, the flow must move approxi￾mately six chord lengths.
Consider the indicial version of the fourth problem in Figure 3.23, i.e., a sharp
gust approaching the foil, or the foil moving into a shadow where the vertical
velocity component suddenly changes (e.g., moving into the tower shadow for
a downwind HAWT). In this case the change in lift force is described by the
Küssner function (see, e.g., Leishman and Martin, 2002; Newman, 1977). An
approximation of the Küssner function is given by:
ΔCLðsÞ
ΔCLðs →∞Þ
≃1  0:5 e0:26s þ e2:0s  	: ð3:61Þ
The function is shown in Figure 3.25. In this case the change in lift starts from zero.
This can be explained by the fact that for 0 < s << 1, only a small fraction of the
aerofoil, close to the leading edge, experiences the gust. For s > 1, the gust is acting
on the complete foil and more than half the steady-state lift force is obtained.
In the vertical motion case in Figure 3.23, there is no change in the lift force
after a change in vertical position. However, if the foil is performing a harmonic
motion in this mode, vertical forces will act on the foil. This issue will be
addressed below.
2 By «an indicial change» is meant that the value changes abruptly from one steady value to another, i.e. changed
by a step function.

a phase angle between the two motions. t denotes time and ω denotes the angular

Thus, in the low-frequency limit ðkf ¼ 0Þ, the lift coefficient for a 2D plate in
steady flow, 2π is approached, while in the high-frequency limit the lift coefficient
is obtained as π.
The last term in [3.63] represents a negative lift force due to a pitch velocity, i.e.,
it adds to the frequency-independent lift force due to a pitch velocity in the first part
of the equation.
3.6.3 Inertia and Damping Effects
As illustrated above, heaving and pitching of an aerofoil generate inertia and
damping forces. In the following, the results of the Theodorsen theory are
used to estimate the damping of the tower’s fore–aft motion due to the
frequency-dependent forces on the rotor. A HAWT is considered. For simpli￾city, a homogeneous inflow to the rotor is assumed. Further, it is assumed that
the tower motion causes a pure axial motion of the rotor, and that no pitching
of the rotor blades takes place, i.e., α_ ¼ 0. As will be discussed in detail in
Section 3.8, the operational mode for a HAWT differs below and above rated wind
speed. The rated wind speed is the wind speed at which the turbine obtains rated
(full) power output. No pitching of the blades is the normal mode of operation
below rated wind speed, and may also be assumed for rapid oscillations at wind
speeds above rated.
Consider a section of length dr at a location r at the rotor blade. With the above
assumptions, the following expression is obtained for the dynamic lift force on the
section:

h is according to the previous derivations the velocity of the blade section normal to
the total incident flow, i.e., perpendicular to Utot in Figure 3.18. For a case with
steady wind and constant rotor velocity, the induction effects will be fully devel￾oped, i.e., the incident velocity in [3.66] is given from:

and the angle relative to the wind is given by [3.50]. For simplicity it is assumed that
ϕ is small, so cos ϕ ≃ 1. Harmonic motion of the blade section is considered, i.e.,

The real part of the dynamic lift force corresponds to an inertia effect, while the
imaginary part corresponds to a damping effect. In the low-frequency limit the
dynamic lift is thus dominated by the damping force, while the inertia effect
dominates at high frequencies.
From Figure 3.27, it is observed that the imaginary part dominates and that the
asymptotic value is a reasonable approximation for kf < 0:1. The real part dominates
for high frequencies and the high-frequency asymptotic value for the real part
approximates the full expression well even for kf < 1. Note also that for kf < 0:35
the real term is negative, corresponding to a negative added mass, as shown in the
following paragraphs.
Defining the added mass force as the force in phase with and proportional to the
acceleration, and the damping effect as the force in phase with the velocity, the
dynamic lift force may be written as:

The approximate expressions correspond to low- and high-frequency asymptotic
values of the Theodorsen function.4 Further details are given in Appendix B. The
full expressions for added mass and damping values are shown in Figure 3.28,
together with the above asymptotic expressions.
It is observed that the damping is positive for all frequencies and that the zero￾frequency asymptotic value is twice the high-frequency asymptotic value. The
added mass tends to minus infinity as the frequency of oscillation tends to zero.
Even if the added mass tends to minus infinity, the inertia force tends to zero, as can
be observed from Figure 3.27. An added mass tending to minus infinity may seem
unphysical; an alternative interpretation is obtained by denoting ω2A an
aerodynamic stiffness, i.e., the aerodynamic stiffness may be written as:

The results from the full and asymptotic expressions are displayed in Figure 3.29.
As observed from the right-hand part of the figure, the stiffness is positive in
a limited range for kf < 0:35. I.e., for very low frequencies there is a force in
phase with the displacement tending to restrict the oscillations. For higher frequen￾cies this force acts in opposite phase of the displacement and behaves thus as
a positive inertia. The use of a stiffness definition rather than inertia demonstrates
clearly how the force tends smoothly to zero as the frequency tends to zero.
3.6.4 Implementation on a Wind Turbine Rotor
The above results will be used to study the inertia and damping effects of a wind
turbine rotor during operation. For simplicity, assume that the rotor is operating in
a steady and homogeneous wind field. Each segment of the rotor blade is thus

motions of the rotor are assumed fast, the corresponding steady-state-induced
velocities are not established. No induction factors are thus to be applied on these
velocities. “Fast” in the context may be related to the reduced frequency,
kf ¼ ωc=2U. The reduced frequency may, under the assumption of a rotational
velocity much larger than the wind velocity and small rotational induction, approxi￾mately be written as:

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University PressThe 2D forces derived above are acting perpendicular to the local incident flow
velocity. Decomposing the axial rotor motion into a local “heave” mode on the
blade section, the local 2D sectional heave velocity is obtained as:
_
h rð Þ¼ η_ x cosðϕð ÞÞ r : ½3:77
Here, η_ x is the velocity of the rotor in axial direction, positive in the downwind
direction, and ϕ is the local inflow angle relative to the rotor plane (see Figure 3.18).
Note that no induction factors are applied to this velocity as we are considering
high-frequency oscillations for which the induction effects are not yet developed.
The axial motion of the rotor also has a component in the direction of incident flow.
The effect of this motion is presently ignored. This can be justified as follows.
The motion of the rotor in axial direction will have a velocity component along
the total inflow vector direction of ΔU ¼ η_ x sin ϕ. The inflow angle is given by
ϕ ¼ sin1
ðU0ð Þ 1  a =UÞ≃U0ð Þ 1  a =U for small inflow angles. As U is changed
to U þ ΔU, there will be a corresponding minor change in the angle of attack
corresponding to approximately Δϕ ≃ U0ð Þ 1  a ΔU=U2
. As this change in inflow
direction may be assumed to be ≪1, the effect of this change is disregarded.
The dynamic lift force at a small radial segment of length Δr may now be
written as:
ΔL rð Þ ≃ ½ω2
A rð Þþ iωB rð Þηxeiωt
Δr cosðϕð ÞÞ r : ½3:78
The axial-directed force on the complete rotor is obtained as:

Here, Nb is the number of blades. The summation is taken over all the sections along
one rotor blade. The sectional added mass and damping are given in [3.71] and [3.72].
Referring the sectional added mass and damping to the axial motion rather than
to the local sectional heave motion, the following approximate results for added
mass and damping for the entire rotor in axial motion are obtained:

The index r refers to the value at the actual radius. Alternatively to the added mass,
the aerodynamic stiffness is obtained from Kx ¼ ω2Ax, which becomes positive
for low frequencies and finite as the frequency tends to zero.
Salzmann and van der Tempel (2005) estimate the damping by considering the
gradient of the lift coefficient with respect to the angle of attack, dCL=dα, for each
section of the rotor. They obtain the damping estimate as:
Bx ¼ NbρΩ

brcrrdr: ½3:82
Here, Rh is the hub radius. The factor br is a correction factor to account for the
effect of variation in rotor speed. As a first estimate, the gradient of the lift
coefficient may be assumed to be 2π. To determine the slope of the lift
coefficient and the proper correction factor, more detailed analysis must be per￾formed (see Liu et al., 2017), where alternative methods for estimating the damping
are also discussed. One of them implies using the slope of the thrust force versus
incident wind speed rather than the slope of the lift force.
As can be observed from the results in the example “Estimated Aerodynamic
Mass and Damping of a 5 MW Turbine” below, the largest damping and the largest
absolute value of the aerodynamic mass is obtained close to the rated wind speed.
This is to be expected as both the forces and their gradients are large in this region.
In the present approach it is assumed that the control system does not react on
motions in the frequency range considered. If the motion frequency is slower and
the controller may react by either changing the rotational speed or the blade pitch
angle, much larger dynamic forces may be experienced.
Souza and Bachynski (2019) show that for floating wind turbines with natural
period in pitch in the range of 25–40 s and surge in the range of 80–140 s, the natural
periods may change significantly depending upon wind speed. This change is
explained partly by a change of mooring stiffness and partly by the controller
action. Also, a significant change in the surge and pitch damping is observed,
mainly explained by a phase shift in the turbine thrust introduced by the controller.
For further discussion of the floater dynamics and controllers, see Chapter 7.
Wind Energy and Wind Loads 119
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University PressEstimated Aerodynamic Mass and Damping of a 5 MW Turbine
Consider the NREL 5 MW reference turbine (Jonkman et al., 2009). Key data for
the turbine are given in Table 3.2 and for the rotor blade in Table 3.1. The tip
speed at rated power is 80 m/s and the rotor radius R ¼ 63 m, corresponding to
rotational speed Ω ¼ 1:27 rad/s. It is assumed that the motion frequency of
interest is the frequency corresponding to the first bending mode of the tower. This
mode causes an almost pure forward-aft, or axial, motion of the rotor. The natural
frequency of this mode is estimated at ω0 ¼ 2:01 rad/s. At a radius of 70% of the
rotor radius, the chord of the blade is about 3.0 m; a characteristic reduced
frequency becomes then kf ¼ ωc=ð2Ω  0:7RÞ ¼ 0:054. I.e., in an aerodynamic con￾text for this 2D rotor section, this is a low-frequency phenomenon.
For the blade pitch and torque controller system proposed by Jonkman et al.
(2009), a low-pass filter with a cut-frequency of 1.57 rad/s is applied, implying
that the blade pitch controller is filtering out responses at frequencies corres￾ponding to the first bending mode of the tower. Thus, from the perspective of the
wind turbine as a system, the elastic mode of motion may be considered to be
a high-frequency phenomenon.
The modal mass for the first bending mode of the tower is estimated at
mel ¼ 4:0  105 kg, and the critical damping thus becomes Bcr ¼ 2melω0. The aero￾dynamic added mass and damping are obtained as shown in Figure 3.30. It is observed
that the aerodynamic mass is negative and reduces the modal mass in this case in the
order of 1%. It will thus not have any significant impact on the tower dynamics. However,
the damping is significant, with a magnitude of 3–5% of the critical damping,

which will contribute to a significant damping of the first bending mode of the tower. It
is also observed that the result for the damping is similar to what is obtained by using
the method proposed by Salzmann and van der Tempel (2005) using a lift coefficient of
2π and a correction factor of 1. A somewhat lower correction factor is most likely
realistic.
3.7 Vortex Methods
As has been shown in Section 3.3, the introduction of circulation, by a vortex
distribution, may be used to satisfy the Kutta–Joukowski condition in the 2D steady
flow case. In the case of non-stationary 2D flow, vortices will be shed from the trailing
edge of the aerofoil, as illustrated in Figure 3.25. This results in time-varying forces on
the foil. The vortex method may be extended to three dimensions, the simplest form of
which is the “vortex line” approach. In this approach, the lift on an aerofoil with finite
span is modeled by a single vortex line along the span, the bound vortex, as illustrated
in Figure 3.31. Due to conservation of vorticity, the vortex line cannot end at the tips of
the aerofoil or wing, but will continue as a “trailing vortex” following the fluid flow
from each wing tip. The vortex line method may be extended to a vortex lattice
method, solving for the vorticity distribution over the wing surface. These issues are
discussed in some details in the following sections.
3.7.1 Velocity Induced by a Three-Dimensional Vortex Line
Consider a small segment of length dl of a vortex line. The segment is located at
ð Þ x; y;z and has a unit direction vector s. The circulation is given by Γ (see
Figure 3.32). The velocity induced at the point ð Þ x1; y1;z1 by this segment is given
from:

3.7.2 Variation in Vortex Strength along Wingspan
In Figure 3.31, a constant circulation is assumed along the wingspan. If the
circulation strength of the bound vortices varies along the span, the difference
in circulation will appear as trailing vortices. This is a consequence of the require￾ment that the circulation must be conserved. This is illustrated in Figure 3.34.

Wind Energy and Wind Loads 123
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University PressFrom this principle, it is observed that an aerofoil may be modeled similarly to in
the BEM method, using many 2D sections. The strength of the bound vortex may
vary between the sections. The difference of the strength of the bound vortices in
two neighboring sections results in a trailing vortex carrying the difference circula￾tion. In the simplest version of the vortex line method, the track of each of the
trailing vortices is assumed to be known a priori. The track is assumed to follow the
mean flow, accounting for the downwash behind the wing. To solve for the strength
of the bound vortices along each segment, a system of equations is set up where the
number of unknowns is equal to the number of bound vortex segments. The total
incident flow velocity and angle of attack is computed as a function of the strength
of the vortices at each segment.
The vortex system illustrated in Figure 3.36 may be modeled as a system of
“horseshoe” vortices. Each horseshoe is composed of the bound vortex on a given

trailing vortices have the same strength. The net strength of the trailing vortices
leaving the border between two adjacent segments is the difference between the
strength of the bound vortices in the two adjacent segments.
To solve for the vortex distribution along the span the following procedure may
be applied. For simplicity a plan wing with small thickness and small angle of
attack is assumed.
1) The span of the wing S is divided into NS sections. The circulation Γi along each
of the sections i is unknown.
2) The chord length at each segment is ci. The bound vortex line is placed
a distance ci=4 from the leading edge. A collocation point is placed at the
middle of each segment, a distance 3ci=4 from the leading edge. The
collocation point is the point where the boundary condition of no flow
perpendicular to the surface is satisfied. The choice of vortex location and
the location of the collocation point are based upon results obtained for
2D sections; for details, see, e.g., Katz and Plotkin (2001).
3) The induced velocity in collocation point number i due to a horseshoe vortex in
segment j is computed. For the bound vortex in segment j, the induced veloci￾ties, using [3.83], becomes:

4) Having computed the normal component of the induced velocity in all Ns
collocation points due to a unit vortex strength in all bound and trailing vortices,
a Ns  Ns influence matrix AΓ is obtained. The unknown vortex strengths for
each horseshoe vortex are found by solving the linear set of equations:
AΓΓ ¼ U0  n: ½3:89
Here, Γ is a vector containing the Ns vortex strengths, U0 is the incident velocity
vector and n is the vector of unit surface normal at the collocation points.

Plotkin (2001).
The general expression for the induced velocity as given in [3.87] becomes very
involved if expanded in the various components. However, if it is assumed that the
bound vortex is parallel to the y-axis, the two trailing vortices are parallel to the
x-axis and the complete horseshoe is located in the plane z ¼ 0 (see Figure 3.36),

Using [3.84] and considering a straight vortex line from C to D in Figure 3.36,
the vertical velocity induced in the point P is obtained as:

For the bound vortex element, assumed to be parallel to the y-axis, the angles are

The total vertical velocity in P is obtained by summation of the three contributions.
In Figure 3.37, an example of the induced vertical velocity, the “downwash” from
such a horseshoe vortex is given. Note the significant downwash in the “interior” of
the horseshoe and the singularities along the vortex lines. The downwash causes
a modification of the effective inflow magnitude and direction. This also causes
a change in the direction of the lift force. There will be a component of the lift force

component is called the induced drag force and is not related to viscous effects, but
the trailing vortices and thus the finite length of the wingspan.
In the above simplistic considerations, it was assumed that the geometry of
the trailing vortices is known a priori. An improved and more realistic
solution is obtained by letting the geometry of the trailing vortices be part
of the solution. The trailing vortices move with the fluid flow, but also induce

a flow problem is normally done by a time stepping procedure where the
vorticity is developed over time (see, e.g., Katz and Plotkin, 2001). The
numerical scheme for such solutions is not straightforward as the number of
unknowns increases for each time step. Also, the geometry of the vortices
develops over time, making it necessary to recompute the influence matrix for
each time step. The vortices will tend to get close and “roll up,” causing
instabilities in the integration scheme. To improve the numerical stability, it
may thus be necessary to combine nearby vortex elements into one vortex
element and to introduce some dissipation of the vorticity. An example of an
implementation of lifting line theory including vortex wakes is given in
Marten et al. (2015).
Induced Velocities on a Rectangular Wing
Assume a rectangular wing with span to chord ratio S=c ¼10. The wing profile has
a 2D lift characteristic similar to a flat plate. Assuming 2D lift along the full span, the
lift is thus obtained as L ¼ ρU0ΓS ¼ ρU2
0 cπαS. Using c ¼ 1 m,
U0 ¼ 10 m=s, α ¼ 0:1 rad and ρ ¼ 1:225 kg=m3 the estimated lift becomes 384:8 N.
Under this assumption all the bound circulation must be continued in one
trailing vortex at each end of the span. The strength of the vortex becomes
Γ ¼ 3:142 m2=s. For the sake of simplicity, assume that the trailing vortices are
aligned with the flow direction, then the two trailing vortices will induce vertical
velocities along the wingspan, as illustrated in Figure 3.33. The induced velocity
will modify the local angle of attack along the span. The modified angle of
attack becomes αm ¼ α þ wðyÞ=U0. Here, w yð Þ is the vertical velocity along the
span induced by the trailing vortices. As seen from Figure 3.33, large, induced
velocities are present close to the wing tips. Using the modified angle of attack
and using the above 2D expression for the lift, the lift on the wing is reduced to
less than 100 N.
However, as the angle of attack is influenced by the trailing vortices, the
strength of the bound vortex will vary along the span, causing trailing vortices to
be shed along the full length of the span, not only from the wing tips. To estimate
the distribution of the circulation along the span, the wing may be modeled by N
horseshoe vortices with the bound vortex at c=4 and the collocation point at 3c=4.
N equations with N unknown vortex strengths are thus obtained. From the
computed vortex strength, the distribution of the lift over the span can be
computed. In Figure 3.39, the computed lift distribution is illustrated for three
different span to chord ratios. In the case with S=c ¼ 10 the estimated total lift
accounting for 3D effects becomes 78% of the value obtained by the pure 2D

approach. From Figure 3.39, it is observed how the 3D lift distribution over the
span approaches the 2D distribution as the S=c ratio increases.

3.7.3 Transient Effects: The Start Vortex
As discussed in Section 3.6.1, a change in lift on an aerofoil is related to
a corresponding change in circulation. Thus, as the bound vortex is changed by ΔΓ,
a corresponding vortex of strength ΔΓ parallel to the bound vortex is shed from
the trailing edge and advected with the flow downstream. If the aforementioned
“horseshoe” model for the vortices is used in modeling transient phenomena, it
implies that every horseshoe is completed by a shed vortex parallel to the bound
vortex. Each horseshoe vortex is thus closed and fulfilling the requirement of
continuity of the vorticity. Transient effects may thus be modeled by using ring
vortices, i.e., quadrilateral vortices shed at every time step. The vortex strength of
each of the sides is equal. Initially, the strength of the bound vortex is governed by
the lift. During the interval of a time step, two trailing vortices are generated,
moving with the free flow, and connected at the end by a shed vortex. At the next
time step, the first ring vortex is advected downstream, and a new one generated.
Wind Energy and Wind Loads 129
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University PressDuring a stationary situation, the two ring vortices will have the same vortex
strengths, causing the upstream part of the first ring vortex, the bound vortex during
the first time step, to cancel the strength of the shed vortex of the second ring vortex.
If the lift changes between the two time steps, there will be a difference vorticity
shed and also appearing as a difference in strength along the trailing vorticities.
Start Vortex
A striking example of shed vortices is an airplane taking off from a runway. As the angle of
attack of the wings is changed and lift is generated, the circulation around the wings has its
counterpart in a shed vortex, the “start vortex” left on the runway. The bound vortex on the
wings and the start vortex on the runway are in principle (except for dissipation) connected
by the trailing vortices throughout the complete journey, as illustrated in Figure 3.40. As
the start vortex may remain on the runway for a long time, it may represent a potential
danger if a small airplane is coming in to land or taking off just after the takeoff of a larger
airplane.

3.7.4 The Vortex Lattice Method
In the vortex line method discussed in Section 3.7.1, the strength of the bound
vortex is determined from the relation between the lift coefficient and the vortex
strength. However, by distributing “horseshoe” vortices or vortex lattices over
the surface represented by the camber line of the aerofoil and introducing
a zero-through-flow condition as certain control points along the mean camber
line, the strength of the vortices may be determined from the geometry of the wing.
The principle is illustrated in Figure 3.41.
The span of the aerofoil is divided into a number of sections, and each
section is divided into a number of panels. Within each panel, a bound vortex
is placed parallel to the leading edge. Typically, the vortex is placed one
130 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University Pressfourth of the panel length from the forward edge. A collocation point is
located at typically three-quarters of the panel length from the forward edge.
Trailing vortices are located along the sides of the panels and leaving the
aerofoil in a smooth manner at the trailing edge, satisfying the Kutta–
Joukowski condition. A system of equations is formulated where the normal
velocity at each collocation point is computed due to a unit strength of each
horseshoe vortex. The strength of the vortices is computed from the condition
of zero through-flow at each collocation point. As the track of the trailing
vortices is part of the solution, an iterative solution is required as the down￾wash will influence the track of the trailing vortices. The trailing vortices may
initially be assumed to follow the undisturbed free flow and, by iteration, the
correct track may be found. The common way to solve the problem is by
solving it in time domain, starting with short or zero-length trailing vortices,
including the shed vortices, and letting the flow and trailing vortices evolve
downstream as the time progresses. This approach is similar to that for the
ring vortices discussed in Section 3.7.3. Detailed description of the approach
is found in, e.g., Katz and Plotkin (2001). Even if the principles involved are
fairly straightforward, the implementation in robust computer codes involves
several numerical issues. The shed and trailing vortices will change geometry
over time, thus the influence matrix used to compute the velocities at the
collocation points must be updated at every time step, causing a significant
increase in computational effort as the number of time steps increases.
Further, the roll-up of vortices may cause numerical problems by the high
induced velocities close to a vortex. This may be handled by merging vortices,
using a finite diameter of the vortex, introducing dissipation of vorticity etc.
However, all such measures must be evaluated toward the convergence and
accuracy of the solutions.

camber are indicated by solid lines. Dotted lines represent bound and shed vortices;
dashed lines represent trailing vortices. The stars indicate collocation points.
Wind Energy and Wind Loads 131
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University PressAs an alternative to a vortex formulation of the problem, a dipole formula￾tion is frequently used. The methods are in principle equivalent, but
have different issues related to the numerical implementation. The dipole or
the vortex distribution is used to handle the boundary condition given by
the angle of attack and the mean camber of the aerofoil. To compute the effect
of the thickness distribution, a sink-source distribution may be used. A sink￾source distribution does not contribute to lift or drag, but to local
modification of the flow pattern and pressure distribution over the aerofoil.
3.8 Characteristics of Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbines
One of the key characteristics of a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) is the power
curve. The power curve relates the power production to the mean wind velocity at the
nacelle height. An example on a power curve is given in Figure 3.42. Here, both the
kinetic power in the wind, the maximum extractable power according to the Betz
theory and the power extracted by an idealized HAWT are shown. At very low wind
speeds there is no power extraction. The wind speed at which the power production
starts is denoted the cut-in speed, typically in the range 3–5 m/s. For state-of-the-art
variable-speed wind turbines, the rotor rotates with increasing wind speed as the
wind speed increases beyond the cut-in speed. Normally the blade pitch is fixed in
this “below-rated wind speed” range. Increasing the rotational speed with the wind
speed makes it possible to work close to the optimum tip speed ratio and maximize

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University Pressthe power extraction. In this range, the power curve will almost be proportional to the
cube of the wind velocity. As the power reaches the rated (design) power, the power
extraction is limited by the generator capacity, and all the available wind power
cannot be utilized. The normal control strategy in this “over-rated wind speed” range
is to keep a constant rotational speed of the rotor and increase the blade pitch angle to
keep a constant turbine torque. For wind speeds close to rated wind speed, a smooth
transition of the control regimes below and above the rated wind speed is used.
The power coefficient, thrust coefficient and the axial induction factors for a real
wind turbine are shown in Figure 3.43. The characteristics of the NREL 5 MW
reference turbine are used as an illustration (Jonkman et al., 2009). It is observed
that the power coefficient and axial induction factor both are almost constant for
below-rated wind velocities, except for at very low wind speeds, but drop just
before rated wind speed is obtained. This smooth transition reduces the peak in the
thrust force that otherwise would occur at rated wind speed. At wind speeds below
6 m/s the tip speed ratio of the turbine is not ideal, thus the power coefficient is
reduced and the thrust coefficient increases.
In Figure 3.44, the thrust, power and axial induction factors for a virtual, ideal
wind turbine running at the Betz limit below rated wind speed and at constant power
above rated wind speed are shown. The key values 8/9, 16/27 and 1/3 are recog￾nized for the below-rated state.
In Figure 3.45 (left), the power coefficient for the ideal and real turbine are
compared. The most significant difference is observed close to rated wind speed.
This is due to the smooth transition between the below-rated and above-rated
control regimes. In Figure 3.45 (right), the corresponding relative thrust forces
are compared. The forces are scaled with the thrust according to the Betz theory at

3.8.1 Reference Turbines
Jonkman et al. (2009), Bak et al. (2013) and Gaertner et al. (2020) have developed
and described a 5 MW, 10 MW and 15 MW HAWT turbine respectively. As the
descriptions of these turbines are complete and well defined, they are frequently
used as reference turbines for testing computational tools as well as being used as
sample turbines for design and analyses of offshore support structures. Table 3.2
gives the main characteristics of the three turbines.
Figure 3.46 shows the results from steady state analysis of the NREL 5
MW turbine as reported by Jonkman et al. (2009) . The operational wind
speeds, up to the cut-out wind speed at 25 m/s, are divided into five regions:

speed at 3 m/s. Here, the controller sets the generator torque to zero. A slow
rotation without power production may occur in this region. As the wind
speed increases, the turbine moves into Region 1.5, where power production
starts. This is a start-up region where the torque is set below the optimum
value to speed up the turbine. This causes a tip speed ratio which is too high
for optimum power production. As Region 2 is reached, the tip speed ratio
has obtained the optimum value and the controller is set to optimize the
power production, i.e., the torque is controlled so that the rotational speed is
proportional to the wind speed. The blade pitch angle is kept constant (at
zero) in this region. In Region 3, above the rated wind speed, the generator
speed is kept constant, and the blade pitch angle is controlled to keep the
torque constant as well. The tip speed ratio is gradually reduced from the
optimum value in this region. Region 2.5 is a transitional zone between
below and above the rated wind speed. Here, the rotational speed, and thus
the tip speed ratio, is gradually decreased relative to the optimum value to
secure a smooth transition to Region 3. In Region 2.5, the torque is thus
increased above the optimum value, unless blade pitching is initiated.
From Figure 3.46, it is observed that the thrust force has a marked peak at
rated wind speed. As wind speeds close to rated occur frequently, designers
wish to avoid this peak load. One way of doing that is by so-called “peak￾shaving.” That implies that the controller in this region is operated to lower
the thrust peak, which may be done by starting blade pitching at lower-than￾Wind speed (m/s)

3.9 Control of Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbines with Variable
Speed and Blade Pitch
As illustrated above for the NREL 5 MW wind turbine, the rotational speed
and blade pitch are controlled to obtain the wanted behavior of the turbine.
Variable-speed turbines with blade pitch control are the “standard” solution
for multimegawatt HAWTs. For older and smaller turbines, fixed rotational
speed and stall regulation exist. For further details about various control
approaches, see, e.g., Burton et al. (2011). In this and the following sections,
some of the basic control principles used for multimegawatt HAWTs are
illustrated. Further details can be found in Burton et al. (2011), Jonkman
et al. (2009) and Anaya-Lara et al. (2018). Additional control issues appear
if the turbine is mounted on a floating support structure. This is discussed in
Chapter 7.
The control system for a variable speed, multimegawatt turbine such as
the 5 MW NREL turbine consists of two main components: a generator torque
controller and a blade pitch controller that acts on all three blades collectively.
The general principle is that the torque controller operates alone below rated
wind speed and acts together with the blade pitch controller above rated wind
speed. This is illustrated in Figure 3.46, which illustrates how the rotational
speed and blade pitch angle vary below and above rated wind speed. Other,
more special purpose control functions are needed to handle, e.g., normal and
emergency shut-down, operation above shutdown wind speed and correspond￾ing start-up procedures, handling of grid failure etc. These issues are not
addressed here. The controller can also be used to add damping to mitigate,
for example, resonant response of the tower bending mode. The main oper￾ational control functions are:
• control of generator torque to keep a desired (optimum) rotational speed. See, for
example, how torque is varying with wind speed;
• control of blade pitch angle to control power output above rated wind
speed;
• control of yaw angle to ensure the turbine heads into the mean wind
direction.
The torque and blade pitch controllers need to be fast-acting, while the yaw
control may be based upon an averaging of the wind direction over several
minutes.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press3.9.1 Simple Controllers
General, simple controllers may be composed of a proportional (P) component, an
integral (I) component and a derivative (D) component. Thus, in a PID controller
the output is controlled by one term proportional to the input; one term proportional
to the time derivative of the input; and one term proportional to the integrated value
over time of the input. In a PI controller, the derivative term is ignored. The input is
normally a difference between an observed or measured value and a desired value,
e.g., the measured torque and the optimum torque. In time domain the PID
controller may be written as:
y tðÞ¼ Kd
dx
dt þ Kpx þ Ki
ðt
0
x dt: ½3:94
Here, x is the input signal and y the output from the controller. Kd, Kp and Ki are the
gains for the derivative, proportional and integral terms respectively. To analyze the
properties of controllers and the corresponding response of dynamic systems,
Laplace transform is a useful mathematical tool. Some key properties of Laplace
transform are given in Appendix C. Here, the response of a single-degree-of￾freedom (SDOF) dynamic system is also derived using Laplace transform. For
further discussion of Laplace transform, reference is made to mathematical
textbooks.
Using Laplace transform, [3.94] may be written as:
Y sð Þ¼ Kds þ Kp þ
Ki
s

 X sð Þ: ½3:95
Here, the capital X and Y denote the Laplace transform of x and y. The proportional
term secures that the corrective signal increases proportional to the deviation from
the wanted value, while the integral term secures that the average deviation over
time between actual and wanted value is close to zero. The derivative term works on
the speed of the deviation, i.e., the faster the deviation increases, the more correc￾tion is done. Using the derivative of x as input to the controller speeds up the action
of the controller but may also cause too great a reaction to high-frequency input and
even unstable response. A proper filtering of the input signal to the controller is
important. For example, Jonkman et al. (2009) use the following simple discrete
time recursion filter for the measured (or computed) generator speed:
Ωfð Þ¼ tn ð Þ 1  α Ωð Þþ tn αΩfð Þ tn1 : ½3:96
Here, Ωð Þ tn is the unfiltered generator speed at time tn, Ωfð Þ tn1 is the filtered
generator speed at the previous time step, α is a low-pass filter coefficient, given by

“corner frequency.” The corner frequency is the frequency where the amplitude is
reduced by 3 dB or to 1=2 ffiffiffi
2
p times the input amplitude. The filter characteristics
using fc ¼ 0:25Hz are shown in Figure 3.47. The value of fc is by Jonkman et al.
(2009), set to be well below the first edgewise natural frequency of the blade. This
secures that the controller does not excite the blade vibrations. Several other low￾pass filters could have been used, providing a sharper characteristic and less phase
shift at low frequencies. However, the need for such filters is case-specific. In
general, all measured signals should be filtered prior to use in a controller.
3.9.2 Control below Rated Wind Speed
To find the optimum tip speed ratio of the NREL 5 MW turbine, Jonkman et al.
(2009) ran several numerical analyses of the wind turbine at below rated wind
speed, at 8 m/s. From these analyses they found that the tip speed ratio giving the
maximum power coefficient CPo was λo ¼ 7:55. This optimum is obtained at zero
blade pitch angle. Figure 3.48 shows the power coefficient CPð Þ β; λ as a function of

reproduced from Chaaban (2012). It is observed that the function is fairly flat close
to the optimum point, meaning that if the rotor speed or blade pitch angle are not
exactly at the optimum value, the power coefficient is not reduced very much.
Figure 3.48 (right) shows CPð Þ 0; λ . Here, the optimum tip speed ratio of λo ¼ 7:55
is observed.
Below rated wind speed, in Region 2, one aims at running the turbine at constant
tip speed ratio and zero blade pitch angle to obtain maximum power production.
Thus, the rotational speed should increase proportionally to the wind speed. The
aerodynamic power acting on the rotor is given from:

CpU3 ¼ 1

ρπR5 Cpð Þ 0; λ
λ3 Ω3
r ¼ QrΩr: ½3:97
Here, the index r refers to rotor torque and angular frequency. Cpð Þ 0; λ is the power
coefficient at zero blade pitch angle and a tip speed ratio λ. The power increases
with the cube of the wind speed. A constant tip speed ratio thus implies that the rotor
torque Qr is proportional to U2 or Ω2
r. It is therefore reasonable to control the
generator torque so that the generator torque qg is proportional to the square of the
rotational speed, i.e.:
qg ¼ Kω2
g: ½3:98
Here, ωg is the generator rotational speed. The gear ratio is the ratio between the
generator and rotor speeds, G ¼ ωg=Ωr. Ignoring losses in the gear system, the
generator torque qg ¼ Qr=G. Assume the factor K is set to:

The difference between the aerodynamic torque and the electrical (generator)

Ql is the torque due to losses in the gear transmission system. These losses are
ignored in the following. Id is the rotational inertia, accounting for the rotational
inertia of the blades, drive train and generator as seen from the low-speed side of the
system. The drivetrain is assumed to be infinitely stiff, so a simple SDOF system is
obtained. Inserting for the aerodynamic torque [3.97] and generator torque [3.98]
into [3.100], the dynamic equilibrium of the rotor speed is obtained as:

γ < γo the difference between the two terms is positive, causing the rotor speed to
increase, while when γ > γo the difference is negative, causing the rotor speed to
slow down. The rotor speed will thus tend to the optimum speed.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University PressIf this electrical load is lost due to, e.g., cable failure, the rotational speed will
increase until the aerodynamic torque tends to zero. This may occur at unacceptably
high rotational speeds. Emergency shut-down procedures are thus implemented to
avoid damages in case of load failure. Various improvements of the above simple
controller are discussed by Burton et al. (2011). Here, among others, improvements
by considering the inertia of the rotor–gear–generator system are discussed. Such
considerations may be needed to obtain a sufficient rapid response to variations in
the wind velocity due to, for example, turbulence.
To improve the reaction to varying wind speeds, the generator torque may be
modified by including a controller term, B, proportional to the generator acceler￾ation, i.e., [3.98] is modified to:

" #: ½3:103
With a positive value of the controller constant B, it is observed that the effective
inertia of the system is reduced, making it possible for the rotor to more rapidly
adapt to variations in the wind speed.
The inertia effect will contribute to a time delay between the actual and desired
rotational speed. As discussed in Section 3.6, there is also a time delay between the
change in wind speed and the corresponding change in lift force on the turbine
blade. Thus, the rotational speed of the rotor will always be delayed relative to the
optimum speed.
From the plot of the tip speed ratio in Figure 3.46 it is observed that the rotor is
running faster than optimum in an interval of wind speeds just above “cut-in.” This
region is defined as a start-up region, between zero rotational speed and the
optimum speed in Region 2.
Transient Response below Rated Wind Speed
Consider the NREL 5 MW reference turbine in a homogeneous wind field without shear
and turbulence. The wind speed is constant at 6 m/s, then stepped up to 8 m/s and back
to 6 m/s again. We assume that the turbine operates in Region 2, i.e., the controller is set
to zero blade pitch and constant tip speed ratio. To simplify the case, transient
142 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press(cont.)
aerodynamic effects are ignored, and it is assumed that the aerodynamic power is given
by the CP-curve for zero blade pitch angle (Figure 3.48). The rotational moment of
inertia as seen from the low-speed side is set to 40:45  106
kgm2. Solving [3.101], the
results as displayed in Figure 3.50 are obtained. The sudden jump in the aerodynamic
power is unphysical as the transient aerodynamic effects are ignored. Also, a real
controller may have implemented limits to the torque rate, avoiding the jump in power
observed in this example. It is clearly observed how the introduction of the modified
generator torque (as in [3.103]) improves the rotor speed response.

3.9.3 Control above Rated Wind Speed
Above rated wind speed, both the rotational speed and the power output should
be kept constant. In the NREL 5 MW case this corresponds to a rotor speed of
12.1 rev/min and a generator speed of 1173.7 rev/min. In this region
a collective blade pitch controller may be used to control the generator speed.
Wind Energy and Wind Loads 143
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University PressAs in [3.100], the difference between rotor torque and generator torque causes
a change of the rotational speed. In Region 2, the rotational speed automatically
tends toward the optimum value if the torque was controlled properly. Further,
the large inertia of the rotor system secures a smooth variation in rotational
speed. In Region 3, however, the aim is not to extract maximum power from the
wind but to keep the power extraction at rated power and the rotational speed
constant.
To maintain constant power, the generator torque in Region 3 must be inversely
proportional to the generator rotational speed:
qg ¼ P0=ωg: ½3:104
where P0 is the rated power and ωg is the actual rotational speed of the
generator. To control the rotational speed, a PID controller may be intro￾duced to control the blade pitch angle. The deviation between the actual and
rated rotational speed of the generator ω0 is used as input to the blade pitch
controller:
Δβ ¼ Kd
dΔωg
dt þ KpΔωg þ Ki
ðt
0
Δωgdt: ½3:105
Here, Δωg ¼ ωg  ω0, the difference between actual and wanted rotational
speed. To find proper values for the controller constants, Jonkman et al.
(2009) use the following approach. Assume that the generator torque is
controlled to be inversely proportional to the rotational speed. For a small
deviation in rotational speed of the generator, Δωg, the corresponding generator
torque is thus obtained as:

P0
ω0

Δωg ¼ P0

may be written as:

Ω0
∂P
∂β
 Δβ: ½3:107
Here, Ω0 ¼ ω0=G is the rated rotor speed. The dynamic equilibrium for the torque
is given by [3.100]. The above expressions for blade pitch angle, generator torque
and aerodynamic torque are now combined. It is convenient to replace the rotational
144 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University Pressvelocity by the rotational angle by writing Φ_ ¼ Ωr. The following expression is
obtained as a result:

" # þ ΦχKi ¼ 0; ½3:108
where χ ¼  G

∂P
∂β. Equation [3.108] for the dynamic variation of the rotational
angle with a PID controller behaves as a mass-spring-damper system. As observed
from Figure 3.51, the pitch sensitivity ∂P=∂β is a negative quantity in the range
considered. The generator torque relation as given from [3.106] introduces
a negative contribution to the damping,  P0
Ω2
0
. Thus, the pitch proportional controller
gain Kp must be sufficiently large to secure that the total damping becomes positive.
The undamped natural frequency and damping ratio for the system in [3.108] are
obtained as:

ζΨ ¼
χKp  P0

:
½3:109
The derivative term Kd may be considered to be set to zero. Jonkman et al.
(2009) found that the performance of the system was not improved by
including the derivative term. The natural frequency should be chosen so
that interaction with the structural frequencies is avoided; similarly, the damp￾ing should be sufficiently large that resonant oscillations are quickly reduced.
ωΨ0 ≃ 0:6 rad=s and ζΨ ≃ 0:6  0:7 is recommended for the NREL 5 MW
turbine (see example below).
The pitch sensitivity ∂P=∂β varies with the incident wind speed. Figure 3.51
shows the blade pitch angle and pitch sensitivity ∂P=∂β as a function of wind speed
for the NREL 5 MW turbine. To account for the wind speed dependency of the pitch
sensitivity, Jonkman et al. (2009) propose adjustment of the proportional and
integral gain with the wind velocity. I.e., as the magnitude of the pitch sensitivity
is increased with the wind speed, the gain is reduced. In the baseline controller, they
add limitations to the torque rate and the pitch rate. They also set limits for the blade
pitch angle.
The simple combined torque and blade pitch controller discussed above can
be illustrated as shown in Figure 3.52. In Region 2.5, close to rated wind
speed, one may implement a smooth transition between the control settings in
Wind Energy and Wind Loads 145
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University PressRegions 2 and 3. This will secure that the rotational speed is limited to the
rated speed and that the peak in the turbine thrust as illustrated in Figure 3.46
is reduced.

According to Jonkman et al. (2009), the natural frequency of the first tower bending mode
in fore-aft direction is 0.32 Hz. This is about the lowest natural frequency of the system.
(The side-to-side natural frequency is marginally lower.) From the recommendations
given by Hansen et al. (2005), they propose to set the controller constants to
Kpð Þ¼ β ¼ 0 0:01883 s, Kið Þ¼ β ¼ 0 0:008069 and Kd ¼ 0. A gain scheduling is
introduced to reduce the gains as the blade pitch angle increases. The gain scheduling
function used is Gc ¼ 1
1þβ=θk with θk ¼ 0:11 rad:
The controller constants are thus varied with the blade pitch angle as
Kð Þ¼ β Kð Þ0 Gcð Þβ . Using the above controller constants and Id ¼ 51:81  106
kgm2,
the following controller natural frequency and damping are obtained by invoking
[3.109] and assuming β ¼ 0: ωΨ0 ¼ 0:58 rad=s and ζ Ψ ¼ 0:62.
∂P=∂ββ¼0 ¼ 28:24  106
Watt=rad has been assumed.
Considering the case β ¼ 0:384 rad ð22 degÞ, the gain control function becomes
0.2227 and the corresponding natural frequency and damping become
ωΨ0 ¼ 0:27 rad=s and ζ Ψ ¼ 0:20.
It is observed that the ratio between the lowest natural frequency of the tower and the
controller frequency is in the range 3.8–8.1. The controller is thus too slow to interact
with the structural eigenmodes.
Control above Rated Wind Speed
Again, the NREL 5 MW reference turbine is used. A simple controller as illustrated in
Figure 3.52 is used. The aerodynamic properties of the turbine are simulated using the
power characteristics shown in Figure 3.48. The data used are computed for pitch
angles less than 9 deg only. Above that value a simple spline extrapolation is used in the
present example. The generator torque control is according to [3.104] and the pitch
control according to [3.105]. The constants in the pitch controller as well as the factor
for gain scheduling are as given in the example “Characteristics of the NREL 5 MW
Baseline Controller.” Further limits on the torque and pitch rates are introduced:
abs dqg
dt  
max ¼ 15 kNm=s, abs dβ
dt  
max ¼ 8 deg=s. Further, the maximum generator
torque is set to 47:4 kNm and the pitch angles are set to be within the range ½0; 15 deg.
The turbine is exposed to a constant wind speed of 12 m/s, stepped up to 14 m/s and back
to 12 m/s. The initial blade pitch angle is set to 0 deg. It should be noted that using the
quasi-static aerodynamic characteristics of the turbine, no transient aerodynamic
effects are accounted for. In Figures 3.53 and 3.54 the variation in aerodynamic power,
rotational speed, power coefficient and pitch angle for this case are shown. The step
change in power observed below is due to the fact that transient aerodynamic effects are
ignored in this example.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University Press3.9.4 Other Control Issues
In the previous chapters, simple controllers for regular operation below and above
rated wind speed are discussed. However, others control functions exist. Various
supervisory controls are needed. Supervisory control refers to a system that moves
the turbine from one operational state to another. According to Burton et al. (2011)
the operational states include:
• standby, when the turbine is available to run if external conditions permit;
• start-up;
• power production;
• shutdown;
• stopped, with fault.
The sequence of operations to bring a pitch-regulated turbine from rest to operation
as the wind velocity increases from below 3 m/s might consist of (Burton et al.
(2011) the following steps:
• Power up the pitch actuators and other subsystems.
• Release the shaft brake.
• Ramp the pitch position demand at a fixed rate to some starting pitch.
• Wait until the rotor speed exceeds a certain small value.
• Engage the closed-loop pitch control of speed.
• Ramp the speed demand up to the generator minimum speed.
• Wait until the speed has been close to the target speed for a specified time.
• Close the generator contactors.
• Engage the power or torque controller.
• Ramp the power/torque/speed set points up to the rated level.
Various control systems are to be implemented to ensure safety. These
systems should operate independently of the main control system. In case
of over-speeding, e.g., due to a fault on the electrical load side, an emer￾gency shut-down procedure should be engaged. Emergency shutdown may
also be engaged manually. Further, acceleration sensors may be used to warn
if abnormal vibrations occur. This may be an indication of structural or
mechanical failure and should initiate shutdown to avoid propagation of
failure.
As observed in Section 3.6, the load on an aerofoil is delayed relative to
a change in wind speed or pitch. All control systems that use the torque,
rotational speed etc. as reference have thus a delayed action to compensate
for the cause of the action. If the wind speed in front of the rotor could
be measured continuously, the set-point for the torque could be adjusted to
Wind Energy and Wind Loads 149
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.004 Published online by Cambridge University Pressthe actual wind speed in a more optimum manner. However, the inhomogen￾eous flow field experienced by large rotors causes a challenge to this
approach.
By using individual blade pitching, it is possible to compensate for the
variation in wind speed encountered by each blade as it moves from top
position to lower position as well as the effect of the slow-down of the
wind speed just in front of the tower. Such individual and active use of the
blade pitch may call for a revised design of the pitch actuators as it implies
much more wear of the system.
The first bending mode of the tower vibration may have very low damp￾ing, and active use of blade pitching may add damping to this mode of
oscillation.
More details on the control systems of wind turbines are found in Burton et al.
(2011) and Anaya-Lara et al. (2018).

3. Show that for a 2D cylinder in a homogeneous ideal flow and with

4. a. Plot the vortex distribution over the chord length for a parabolic aerofoil

b. Find a relation between angle of attack and camber that gives zero

5. National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) profiles are fre￾quently used in aerofoils. In the four-digit NACA series, the aerofoil sections
are defined by NACAxyzz. Here, the first digit, x, gives the maximum camber
as a percentage of the chord length. The second digit, y, gives the distance of
the maximum camber from the leading edge, in tenths of the chord length.
The last two digits, zz, give the maximum thickness of the aerofoil as

with maximum camber of 2%, located 0.4 of the chord length from the
leading edge, with a maximum thickness of the aerofoil of 12% of the
chord length. Expressions for the camber line and thickness distribution are

Support Structures for Offshore Wind Turbines
4.1 Introduction
The main difference between land-based and offshore wind turbines is in the
support structure that carries the rotor, electrical generator and related equipment.
This chapter discusses some of the most common as well as proposed support
structures for offshore wind turbines. The key requirements of the support structure
are summarized, and the main principles, advantages and disadvantages of the
various solutions are discussed.
As the offshore wind industry is not very old, a lot of support structures have been
proposed and to some extent also designed. However, only a few designs have reached
a mature level and mass production. Most bottom-fixed wind turbines use monopiles.
Few floating wind farms exist, for which the only concepts in use are spar buoys and
semisubmersibles. However, many floating concepts have been proposed, some of
which have also been tested at various scales. This chapter discusses only support
structures for Horizontal-AxisWind Turbines (HAWTs). For vertical-axis wind turbines
some additional challenges must be considered, e.g., how to withstand the torsional
moment from the turbine.
The rated power of wind turbines is steadily increasing. The first offshore
windfarm, installed at Vindeby in Denmark in 1991, was situated in water depth
of approximately 4 m. The windfarm consisted of 11 turbines, each with a rated
power of 0.45 MW. Thirty years later, we see projects underway with turbines
with rated power exceeding 15 MW to be installed at water depths ten times as
deep as the Vindeby turbines, or even as floating units.
The challenges faced can be illustrated by the following example.
Size of Support Structure Increases with Rated Power
Assume a turbine with power coefficient 0.48 at rated wind speed of 11 m/s (see
Section 3.8). The extracted power at rated power is then 391 W/m2
. The
diameters of a 5 MW and a 15 MW turbine with this power density become
128 m and 221 m respectively. With a clearance to the sea surface of 25 m, the
rotor axis will be located at 89 m and 131.5 m above sea level in the two cases.
153
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press(cont.)
Considering that the weight of the rotor-nacelle assembly (RNA) in most cases
increases more than proportional to the power, it is realized that the complexity
in assembly and replacement of major components increases significantly with
the size of the turbine. Also, the overturning moment at sea level due to the
rotor thrust is 4.4 times larger for the 15 MW than the 5 MW turbine in this
example.
The rated power of the turbine and the water depth are thus key parameters for
choosing the support structure. Based upon the discussion of the atmospheric
boundary layer in Chapter 2, the uncertainty related to the wind speeds at such
heights should be kept in mind.
The functional requirement for the support structure can briefly be summar￾ized as follows. The support structure should: carry the RNA; have sufficient
strength to withstand the operational and extreme wind loads on the turbine
and from waves; have sufficient fatigue resistance to withstand the dynamic
loads during the lifetime of the wind turbine; and keep the motions of the
wind turbine within acceptable limits. The last requirement is particularly
relevant for floating wind turbines. The design lifetime for wind turbines is
normally 20–25 years. Most support structures are made from steel, but
composite materials and concrete are also used.
4.2 Components of an Offshore Wind Turbine
The most frequently used wind turbine is the “Danish design,” a three-bladed,
upwind HAWT. Horizontal-axis means that the rotor is mounted on an almost
horizontal axis. This design has over time been developed to have very high
efficiency as well as being robust. An illustration of an offshore HAWT of the
Danish design is shown in Figure 4.1. Most designs are so-called upwind turbines.
This implies that the rotor always works on the upwind side of the tower. Thereby,
the shadow effect or wake effect from the tower is avoided by the rotor. If the blades
should pass through such a wake at every rotation, they would induce large dynamic
loads.
At the top of the tower we have the rotor-nacelle assembly (RNA). The blades are
mounted to the rotor hub. The connection between the hub and the rotor blades is
such that the blades may be pitched. The nacelle is the machinery house in which all
the components transforming the rotor motion into electrical power are located.
Some key components include a low-speed axle transmitting the rotor motion to
the gear, which speeds up the rotational speed and transmits the high-speed rotation
154 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.005 Published online by Cambridge University Pressto the electrical generator. In addition, various control systems, brake systems, air￾conditioning systems etc. are located in the nacelle.
Most towers are similar to those used for land-based turbines but designed to
withstand the additional loads experienced in the offshore environment, such as
wave loads and corrosion. Usually the tower is conical, with the largest diameter at
the bottom.
The tower is mounted on top of a transition piece between the tower and the
substructure. The transition piece is a consequence of the most common choice of
substructure, the monopile, and its installation technique. The monopile is driven
into the sea bottom and the transition piece is mounted on top. This makes it
possible to install the tower vertically even if the verticality of the monopile is
not exact. In newer concepts, where the complete support structure is an integrated
design, the transition piece may be omitted.
Close to the bottom of the tower, at a height above the reach of the waves, a work
platform or access platform is mounted. As the name indicates, this platform is used
for accessing the wind turbine from boats. From the access platform a door gives
access to the interior of the tower and the nacelle.
The structure below the transition piece and the sea floor is denoted the substruc￾ture. The most common design, the monopile, is a vertical steel cylinder. The part
below the sea floor is denoted the foundation. How far down into the sediments the
monopile is driven depends upon the geotechnical properties of the sediments. Other
designs of substructures exist, which are discussed in more detail in the following
sections.

Support Structures for Offshore Wind Turbines 155
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.005 Published online by Cambridge University PressAll components below the RNA are known collectively as the support
structure. For floating wind turbines, the floater constitutes the substructure.
4.3 Fixed Substructures
The support structure’s primary function is to transfer weight and environmental
loads to the sea floor. As explained in Chapter 3, the extraction of wind energy
implies horizontal aerodynamic loads on the rotor. These loads cause bending loads
in the support structure. The magnitude of the overturning moment increases with
the distance downward from the nacelle. Therefore, a conical shape of the tower is
a natural consequence.
The rotor blades bend downwind due to the aerodynamic loads. To avoid
collision between the blades and the tower, the rotor blades are usually
designed with some cone. The cone implies that the blades are not in the
rotor plane when unloaded; instead, they have some forward cone angle.
As seen from Table 2.2, the cone angle for the reference turbines is in the
range −2.5 – −4.0 deg. (Negative cone angle implies that the blade tip is in
front of the blade root). The rotor axis is not exactly horizontal but has some
tilt in the order of 5 – 6 deg. Further, the blades are mounted in the hub some
distance from the tower axis. The cone, tilt and overhang, together with
a limited tower diameter, guarantee that the blades, even at maximum deflec￾tion, avoid collision with the tower.
The substructure should transfer the overturning moment and forces further
down to the sea floor. At the same time, extra environmental loads on the substruc￾ture due to waves and current should be minimized. The design of the substructure
must also take into consideration the conditions of the bottom sediments, i.e., how
the loads are to be transferred from the substructure via the foundation to the bottom
sediments or rock.
Bottom-mounted support structures may be classified according to how they are
fixed to the sea floor (DNV, 2021a). The structures are:
- piled structures
- gravity-based structures
- skirt-and-bucket structures
Piled structures are presently the most frequently used solution. They are used for
monopiles as well as for jacket structures (see Sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2). Gravity￾based structures are used where piling is not possible, for example, on a rocky sea
floor. Skirt-and-bucket structures may be considered where the bottom conditions
are very soft.
Further, the substructures may have various designs:
156 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.005 Published online by Cambridge University Press- monopile structures
- jacket (lattice/space-frame) structures
- tripod structures
- gravity structures
The monopile, jacket and tripod solutions are illustrated in Figure 4.2. In addition to
these main categories, hybrid solutions exist.
To fulfil the fatigue life requirements, the support structure should not be excited
at its natural frequencies. Due to low damping, excitation of natural frequencies
may cause large dynamic responses and stresses, reducing the fatigue life consid￾erably. For this reason, computation of the system’s natural frequencies is an
important part of the design process for the support structure. This issue is dis￾cussed in further detail in Chapters 5 and 6.
In the actual design of the support structure, several practical issues are to be
considered. For example, practical limits exist with respect to manufacturing very
thick steel plates. If large thicknesses are required (e.g., above 100 mm), few
manufacturing sites may be available, and the production of tubular elements
may be difficult. Lifting, transport and installation procedures may also put restric￾tions on physical dimensions as well as the weight of components.
4.3.1 Monopiles
The monopile is the most frequently used substructure for bottom-fixed wind turbines.
The monopile is a tubular structure of constant diameter, as illustrated in Figure 4.2. It
is normally installed in sea floors consisting of sand or clay-like sediments. The
Figure 4.2 Monopile (left), jacket substructure (middle) and tripod substructure
(right).
Support Structures for Offshore Wind Turbines 157
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.005 Published online by Cambridge University Pressmonopile is lifted by a crane vessel into vertical position and subsequently lowered to
the sea floor. It is then driven to the required depth by hammering. The tolerances on
verticality are strict (typically less than 1 deg). A transition piece is used to correct the
verticality prior to installing the tower.
The overturning moment in the monopile due to wind and wave loads on the
turbine increase as the water depth increases. Also, the natural frequency of the first
bending mode decreases (see Chapter 5). To fulfil the design criteria, increased water
depth thus calls for larger diameter and/or larger wall thickness, both driving weight
and costs. In addition, an increased diameter increases the wave loads. Monopiles are
therefore best suited for shallow water applications, even if the limits both with
respect to turbine size and water depth are continuously challenged. Manufacturing
and installation issues limit the size of the monopile, e.g., wall thickness and
weldability, equipment for lifting and piling/hammering. The IEA 15 MW reference
turbine is proposed with a monopile diameter of 10 m and a monopile mass of
1:318  106 kg (Gaertner et al., 2020). The length of the monopile depends upon the
site-specific sediment conditions and may thus vary throughout a wind farm. In
2019, monopiles were used for 70% of the newly installed substructures in Europe.
Jackets were the second-most used substructure (WindEurope, 2020).
An obvious advantage of the monopile is the simple geometry, which is well
suited to automated manufacture. Examples of use and sizing of monopiles are
given in, e.g., Negro et al. (2017) and Arany et al. (2017).
4.3.2 Jackets
To avoid the increased diameter and steel thickness of the monopile, the jacket
substructure represents an alternative. As the jacket widens toward the sea floor, the
forces in the legs do not need to increase, even if the overturning moment increases
downward. Further, the jacket has only small structural volumes exposed to waves.
The wave forces are thus lower on a jacket than on a monopile. The jacket is
normally fixed to the sea floor by one or more piles at each corner. Most jackets
have four legs (corners), but three-legged versions exist.
A disadvantage of the jacket substructure is the more complicated geometry,
involving higher manufacturing costs per unit mass of steel than monopiles.
4.3.3 Tripods
Tripods represent an intermediate solution between the monopile and the jacket
structure (see Figure 4.2). They consist of a large-diameter central tubular element,
which is stiffened toward the bottom with inclined legs in three directions.
The tripod is secured to the sea floor by piles. However, both the jacket and the
158 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.005 Published online by Cambridge University Presstripod can use gravity or suction foundations as an alternative. Tripods have been
used for some offshore development, but not in more recent years. An example of
structural analysis of a tripod substructure is found in Chen et al. (2013). A variant,
the “quadropod,” using stiffeners in four directions, is also a possible solution. Both
the jacket and the tripod can carry the increased moment close to the sea floor
without increasing the structural dimensions close to the sea surface, causing
increased wave loads.
4.3.4 Gravity-Based Substructures
Gravity-based substructures are of particular interest if the bottom sediment
conditions are not suited for piling. The overturning moment is then transferred
to the sea floor by a sufficiently heavy and wide substructure. The gravity-based
substructure may be formed as a caisson with open compartments. After the
substructure is placed on location, the compartments are filled with rock, iron
ore or similar heavy, low-cost materials. Depending upon the sediment condi￾tions, gravity-based substructures may be fitted with skirts penetrating the upper
sediment layer.
Some gravity-based substructures are designed to be floated out to the installa￾tion site, then submerged and filled with ballast. Examples of gravity-based
substructures are given in Peire, Nonnemann and Bosschen (2009) and Attari and
Doherty (2015).
4.4 Floating Substructures
Wind turbines with fixed substructures will experience dynamic motions due to
elastic deformation of the support structure, in particular bending deformation of
the support structure. The first couple of bending modes (see Chapter 5) may have
low natural frequencies. A design requirement is that these frequencies should not
be in the range of wave load excitation frequencies, nor should they interfere with
the blade passing frequencies. Floating substructure will, in addition to the elastic
deformations, move as a rigid body in up to six degrees of freedom. These degrees
of freedom are frequently denoted “free” modes, as opposed to the “restricted”
modes that have a stiff connection to the sea floor and thus very limited dynamic
deformations. Further to the additional modes of motion, the floaters must also
satisfy requirements related to buoyancy, stability and maximum static and
dynamic motions, in particular platform pitch. These issues are discussed in more
detail in Chapter 7. The commonly used names for the six rigid-body modes of
motion of a floating structure are given in Figure 7.2.
Support Structures for Offshore Wind Turbines 159
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.005 Published online by Cambridge University PressFloating substructures are applied in waters too deep for fixed substructures,
either due to costs, loads or natural frequency issues. The floating structure is
allowed to move freely in the “free modes,” where the natural frequency is lower
than the frequencies of the excitation loads. The dynamic motion response is thus
limited mainly by inertia effects, while the mean position is kept by “soft springs,”
typically mooring lines. As for most dynamic systems, the designer has the option
to either allow for large dynamic motions or to accept large restoring forces (see
Chapter 5 for details).
In the design of mooring systems, one must fulfil requirements related to
strength, flexibility and fatigue. If very small motions are required, large mooring
line loads causing increased requirements for ultimate strength and fatigue capacity
must be expected. If larger motions can be accepted, lower extreme and fatigue
loads can be obtained. However, the dynamic deformations of the power transfer
cable, frequently called the “dynamic cable,” will increase. The directional control
(yaw) of the substructure may also be worse to handle. Design of floaters for
shallow water (less than approximately 50 m) and severe wind and wave conditions
may be a challenging task. The mooring system must be sufficiently strong and at
the same time flexible.
In the following sections, four main groups of floating substructures are dis￾cussed: semisubmersibles, spars, tension leg platforms (TLP) and barge-like struc￾tures. Most of the proposed solutions are in one of these categories. Most concepts
are designed to have one turbine per support structure. Solutions using multiple
turbines on one support structure are also proposed. In most cases these use variants
of the above substructures, except spars.
4.4.1 Semisubmersibles
The semisubmersible substructure is in most cases designed with three or four
vertical columns and either horizontal pontoons connecting the columns or hori￾zontal plates at the lower end of the columns (see the principles illustrated in
Figure 4.3).
To obtain favorable dynamic motion response of a semisubmersible , the
designer plays with parameters like column diameter, draft and column spacing,
height and width of pontoons, and size of bottom plates. The area of the water plane
together with the mass of the complete structure plus the vertical hydrodynamic
mass determines the natural period in heave. Similarly, the roll and pitch restoring
forces together with the inertia in rotation determine the natural periods in roll and
pitch. Definition of the modes of motion and examples of how to compute hydro￾static and hydrodynamic quantities are given in Chapter 7. All six rigid-body modes
of motion for a semisubmersible are free modes. The natural periods in the free
160 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.005 Published online by Cambridge University Pressmodes are to be located outside the range of wave excitation periods. By playing
with the dimensions for the columns and the pontoons, one may almost cancel out
the wave excitation forces at certain wave periods. This is illustrated in Figure 4.5
for a spar-like substructure. The characteristics of the heave and roll/pitch motions
of a semisubmersible are similar. Examples are given in Section 7.5. The turbine
tower may either be located on top of one of the corner columns or on top of
a separate center column.
As state-of-the-art wind turbines are designed for fixed foundations, little informa￾tion is available about the maximum acceptable for roll and pitch motions. The roll and
pitch angle and corresponding non-vertical loading in the machinery is one design
issue; another is the accelerations due to pitch and roll combined with the effect of
gravity.
The restoring forces in surge, sway and yaw are obtained by the mooring lines.
The mooring lines will represent soft springs, securing that the floater is kept within
a certain limited excursion radius to avoid overstressing the power cable, and to
avoid yaw motions that are too large. Large yaw motions of the floater will
challenge the yaw mechanism on top of the tower.
Figure 4.3 Examples of semisubmersible substructures: Left: vertical columns
with perforated bottom plates and connected by a space-frame structure. Right:
vertical columns connected with large horizontal pontoons.
Support Structures for Offshore Wind Turbines 161
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.005 Published online by Cambridge University PressConcepts also exist where the semisubmersible is moored at one point only
(“single-point mooring”). In such cases the whole support structure will rotate
around the point of anchoring.
The challenge with the semisubmersible is, among others, the static tilt due to the
thrust on the wind turbine. To avoid a too-large static tilt, the roll and pitch stiffnesses
must be sufficiently large. This may challenge the requirement of keeping the natural
period in roll and pitch outside the range of wave excitation. To avoid this problem, the
size of the floater may be increased, or one may use active ballasting, i.e., pumping
water between compartments in the substructure to compensate for the static wind
overturning moment.
A favorable characteristic of the semisubmersible is the shallow draft. This
allows for assembly of the complete wind turbine at a quayside and tow-out in
shallow water areas. The complex geometry may on the other hand be a cost driver
in manufacturing.
4.4.2 Spars
A spar-like substructure is illustrated in Figure 4.4. The requirement to the dynamic
behavior of the spar substructure is similar as for the semisubmersible. However, due to
the simpler geometry, there are fewer parameters to play upon to fulfil the various
requirements. As shown in Figure 4.4, the diameter of the spar at the waterline is
smaller than that of the main hull. By tuning the ratios between these two diameters as
well as the draft of the substructure, the desired heave natural period is obtained. By
proper ballasting, the moment of inertia in roll and pitch as well as the center of gravity
(CG) are controlled and the desired natural periods in roll and pitch can be obtained.
A typical heave motion response characteristic of a wind turbine upon a spar
substructure is illustrated in Figure 4.5. The cancellation at about 22 s is due to the
change in diameter along the spar. To further increase the vertical inertia of the
structure, a horizontal circular plate with diameter exceeding that of the column
may be placed at the bottom of the column. By such an arrangement the natural
period in heave will increase and extra damping will be introduced. The plate will
have minor impact on the wave loads.
The large draft of the spar structure (typically in the range 50–100 m) causes
a large moment of inertia in roll and pitch and makes it thus easy to obtain large
natural periods in these modes of motion. Further, a large distance between CG and
center of buoyancy (CB), together with a large displacement, implies that the
restoring forces in roll and pitch are sufficiently large to ensure small trim and heel.1
1 In the terminology of marine structures, roll and pitch are used for the rotational dynamic motion around the two
horizontal axes (x and y), while the corresponding static displacements are denoted trim and heel or list.

Support Structures for Offshore Wind Turbines 163
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.005 Published online by Cambridge University PressThe main advantage of using a spar-like substructure is that favorable dynamic
properties can be obtained using a very simple, easy-to-manufacture geometry. The
main challenge is related to the large draft, requiring a deep assembly site prior to
tow-out of the complete wind turbine.
The spar concept was the first to be used for a multimegawatt offshore wind
turbine in a harsh environment. Comparison between measured and computed
behavior of the “Hywind Demo” spar concept installed in 2009 can be found in
Skaare et al. (2015).
4.4.3 Tension Leg Platforms
The tension leg platform (TLP) is fixed to the sea floor by vertical, stiff tethers as
illustrated in Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.7. The stiff tethers restrict the support
structure’s ability to move in heave, pitch and roll. For these modes of motion,
the wind turbine is “restricted,” while the surge, sway and yaw modes are “free.”
A design criterion for the TLP is that all the tethers should always have positive tension.
The initial tension in the tethers is obtained by an excess buoyancy in the system.
During operation the tension will change due to mean and dynamic forces from wind
Figure 4.6 Example of a TLP substructure with five tension legs (tethers).
164 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.005 Published online by Cambridge University Pressand waves. The geometry of the hull should be designed to minimize the vertical loads
in the tethers due to wave loading. The maximum tension in the tethers should neither
exceed the capacity of the anchors nor that of the tethers, while the minimum tension
should not be below zero. Both for the maximum and minimum proper safety margins
should be included. The anchors may be designed as combined gravity and suction
(bucket) anchors. The weight of the anchors should normally at least carry the mean
vertical force, while part of the dynamic force may be carried by suction effects.
TLPs have been used with success in the offshore oil and gas industry in the
development of deep offshore oil and gas fields. The very small motions in heave,
roll and pitch make it possible to use dry wellheads located at the platform deck.
TLPs also provide a favorable substructure for a wind turbine as the motions of the
RNA are much smaller than for the semisubmersible and spar solutions.
For offshore oil and gas platforms, the main source of dynamic loads are the
wave loads, while for a wind turbine the wind loads, acting at nacelle level, are very
important. The two cases are illustrated in Figure 4.7. The large overturning
moment caused by the wind loads, combined with the short horizontal distance
between the tethers, causes large dynamic loads in the tethers.
4.4.4 Barge-Like Structures
A barge is basically a rectangular floating structure with shallow draft as illustrated
in Figure 4.8. Such structures are easy to produce and may provide a stable
substructure for wind turbines. The barge is free to move in all six rigid-body
degrees of freedom. However, most barge shapes have unfavorable motion

accelerations for a wind turbine. However, exceptions exist, e.g., barge-like struc￾tures looking like a square ring pontoon,2 which seem to exhibit favorable motion
characteristics, partly explained by the interaction between the water motion inside
and outside the ring pontoon and by the actions of the lip along the lower side of the
ring pontoon. Such a lip increases the hydrodynamic mass in heave, roll and pitch
and also contributes with additional damping due to vortex shedding along the edge
of the lip (Beyer et al., 2015).
4.4.5 Choice of Substructure
The choice of substructure for a specific wind farm project is mainly a cost
issue. The cost of the support structure is to a large extent driven by the size
of the wind turbine and the water depth. Until now, the trend has been an
increase in turbine size even if the weight of the RNA per MW installed
capacity may increase. In a wind farm with a certain total installed power, it

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.005 Published online by Cambridge University Presshas been favorable to use fewer large units than many smaller to reduce the
cost of electricity.
Schematically, the cost of a wind turbine substructure as a function of water
depth is illustrated in Figure 4.9. In shallow waters, the monopile is the preferred
solution if the bottom sediment conditions allow for driving the monopile to
a sufficiently large depth. As the water depth increases, the cost of the monopile
increases significantly and jackets and tripods become more favorable solutions.
Presently typical transitional depth from monopiles to jackets or tripods is in the
range of 30–50 m. Damiani, Dykes and Scott (2016) find that for conditions in the
US Gulf of Mexico, the cost of monopiles exceeds that of jacket substructures for
water depths above approximately 40 m. A 5 MW wind turbine was used in the
study. Such absolute limits are, however, continuously challenged. As the water
depth increases further, the cost of the jacket structures also becomes prohibitive.
As there are many floater concepts and the technology is not as mature as for jacket
structures, it is hard to state at which water depth the cost of a jacket exceeds that of
a floater. Also, the cost of the mooring system for shallow-water floaters is
frequently underestimated and may be higher than in deeper waters. There may
thus be a range of water depths in which neither the jacket/tripod solution nor the
floater solution is attractive. The cost of floaters increases more slowly with water
depth than for fixed bottoms as the substructure does not need to be modified as the
water depth increases, and thus the extra costs are related to the increased length of
mooring lines and electrical cables only.

Linear Dynamics
This chapter gives a short review of the theory of linear dynamics of single-body,
multiple-body and continuous systems. In the analysis of offshore wind turbines,
a thorough understanding of dynamic properties is important for the avoidance of
excitation of natural frequencies and to understand how the various modes of
motion are coupled and excited.
It is convenient to consider a linear dynamic system in the frequency
domain. However, even if the structural system may be assumed to be
a linear system, the forces acting on the system may be nonlinear. Thus,
most offshore wind turbines need to be analyzed in the time domain. For
this purpose, the state-space formulation of dynamic equations is very useful.
In this chapter, the state-space formulation will be demonstrated for a system
with two degrees of freedom. The formulation can easily be extended to
a system with multiple degrees of freedom.
5.1 SDOF System: Free Oscillations
As an introduction to the dynamic response of complex systems, the key features of
a linear, single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system are summarized. The system is
illustrated in Figure 5.1. The linear dynamic equilibrium equation for the system is
written as:
mx€ þ bx_ þ kx ¼ F tð Þ: ½5:1
Here, x is the displacement of the body, m is the body mass, b is the linear damping,
k is the stiffness and F tð Þ is a time-dependent external force. To find the natural
frequency of the system, the external force is set to zero and it is assumed that the
solution may be written in the form x ¼ xAeλt
. x is now the displacement from the
mean position. [5.1] may then be written as:

Here, ω2

introduced. The change of sign and introduction of i ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffi
1 p in the last expression
of [5.3] is done to be able to handle cases where ω2
0 > β2
. In this case the
damping is called subcritical, and the system is oscillating around a mean
position. If ω2
0 < β2
, the system has supercritical damping, and the motion is non￾oscillatory.
The nontrivial solution for x in the subcritical damped case can be written as:

It is understood that it is the real part of the complex expressions that has physical

an oscillatory term.

toward zero without crossing zero. The case with ζ ¼ 1 is denoted as critical
damping and represents the limiting case between oscillatory and non-oscillatory
behavior.
Free decay of a dynamic system with an initial displacement and zero initial
velocity is illustrated in Figure 5.2. Here, critical damping as well as subcritical
damping and zero damping cases are illustrated. Note the period elongation for the
highly damped cases.
The damping level for the free decay is frequently expressed through
the logarithmic decrement. Consider the ratio between two following ampli￾tudes in the subcritical case, x tp

5.2 SDOF System: Forced Oscillations
Assume that the force term in [5.1] can written as F tð Þ ¼ FA cosð Þ ωt . If such a force
is suddenly introduced to the system at t ¼ 0, a transient response is experienced.
With a positive damping in the system, the transient will die out over time and
finally a pure oscillatory response with the same frequency as the load will remain.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.006 Published online by Cambridge University PressExamples of the computed response for various levels of damping are shown
in Figure 5.4. The peak response frequency is shifted toward lower frequen￾cies as the damping increases. The phase between the response and the forcing
is shifted 180 deg as the excitation frequency is increased from below to
above resonance. Note that the phase shift takes place more gradually as the
damping is increased. For frequencies much lower than the natural frequency,
the response becomes almost quasi-static and almost frequency-independent.
A quasi-static response implies that the motion amplitude is close to the ratio
between the force amplitude and the stiffness. On the contrary, for high
frequencies the response is controlled by the inertia and the response ampli￾tude becomes inversely proportional to ω2m.
5.3 System with Multiple Degrees of Freedom

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.006 Published online by Cambridge University PressThis matrix formulation can be extended to an arbitrary number of freedoms. The
linear system is straightforward to solve in the frequency domain. The nice feature
about the linearity is that the system may be solved for simplified load cases and
then a summation of the responses for several load cases provides the solution for
a more complicated load case.
In the case of nonlinear equations, when some of the coefficients may be time-,
velocity- or position-dependent, a time domain solution of the system response is
required. To perform efficient time domain integration of the coupled system of
equations, it is useful to replace the N second-order differential equations with 2 N
first-order differential equations, a so-called state-space representation of the equa￾tions. As an example, let us consider the 2DOF system studied above. A new
variable y ¼ ð Þ x1 x2 x_1 x_2
T is introduced. Here, the superscript T denotes the
transposed matrix. Rearranging [5.16] and introducing y, the following expressions
are obtained:

The simplest way to solve this system of equations numerically is by the forward
Euler integration method. Using a discrete time step of length Δt, the solution for
time t þ Δt is found from the state at time t as:

Linear Dynamics 175
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.006 Published online by Cambridge University PressThe integration starts by stating the initial positions and velocities in yð Þ0 and the
initial force vector Fð Þ0 . The forward Euler method works well for simple dynamic
systems but should be used with care. If the system exhibits high natural frequen￾cies, the integration scheme may diverge as the damping level is low. For
complicated systems more advanced integration schemes, such as for example
the fourth-order Runge–Kutta scheme, are recommended (see, e.g., Press et al.,
1989; Dahlquist and Björck, 1974).
Figure 5.6 shows an example of the frequency-dependent response of a 2DOF
system. The force vector is in this example 
0 FAcosð Þ ωt
	T
. For very low frequen￾cies a quasi-static response is observed, x1 ≃ FA=k1 and x2 ≃ FAð Þ 1=k1 þ 1=k2 .
To interpret the response at higher frequencies it is very useful to find the
undamped eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes. A stationary solution in the form
x ¼ ψeiωt is assumed. The undamped eigenvalue problem then reads:
ω2M þ K  	ψ ¼ 0 or λψ ¼ M1
Kψ: ½5:21
To each eigenvalue λi ¼ ω2
0i there is a corresponding eigenvector ψi . ψi defines the
contribution from each of the different modes of motions, in our case given by x1
and x2, to the specific undamped resonant mode of motion, given by ψi
. In the case
of no damping, ψi is real. For floating vessels, the six rigid modes of motion are
denoted as surge, sway, heave, roll, pitch and yaw, and defined according to
a chosen coordinate system. However, due to coupling effects, off-diagonal terms
in the mass and restoring matrices, the eigenmodes seldom correspond to these
modes. For example, a “heave resonant motion” will in most cases also contain
some contribution from pitch. Details about multibody dynamics and eigenvalues
can be found in standard textbook on dynamics (e.g., Irgens, 1999). More examples
on multibody dynamics are found in Chapter 8.

characteristics as given in the above example and excited harmonically by a force
f tðÞ¼ FA cosð Þ ωt , FA ¼ 1 N acting at the top of mass m2.
The elements of ψi tell how much each of the displacements x1 and x2 contribute to the
eigenvector. Let the system be excited by a harmonic force acting at m2:
F ¼ ½  0 fA cosð Þ ωt T with fA ¼ 1N. The response characteristics are shown in
Figure 5.6, where it is observed that the two eigenfrequencies correspond to maxima of
the amplitudes of motion. For frequencies below the first eigenfrequency,
ω01 ¼ 0:56 rad=s ¼ 0:0892 Hz, the motion is dominated by mode 2. The two masses
move in phase, m2 with larger amplitude than m1. In the low frequency limit the
response is quasi-static. When the excitation frequency is close to ω01, both m1 and m2
exhibit large oscillations. The same is the case close to the second natural frequency
ω02 ¼ 1:79 rad=s ¼ 0:284 Hz. In the range between the two eigenfrequencies, the
responses of the two masses are partly in phase and partly out of phase. For frequencies
far above ω02, the response is again dominated by the motion of m2 and the two masses
are oscillating almost out of phase.
2DOF System, Transient Response
Figure 5.7 shows the transient displacements of the system displayed in Figure 5.5. The
initial displacements are x1ð Þ¼ 0 0, x2ð Þ¼ 0 1 and zero initial velocities. No external
forces are acting. It is observed how the transient is damped out over time, converging
toward a zero displacement for both masses. It is also observed that initially both modes
of motion oscillate with comparable amplitudes, while after a while the first mode,
corresponding to a period of 11.22 s, dominates. From the right-hand part of the figure,
it is observed that initially there is a large force in spring 2, while later the masses move
almost in phase, causing a small force in spring 2 and a dominating force in spring 1.
In this example, a simple forward Euler integration scheme was used to step the
equations in [5.19] forward in time.

5.4 Continuous System
SDOF and 2DOF systems have so far been considered. Continuous systems such
as, for example, a beam with distributed mass have an infinite number of degrees of
freedom. For some simple systems, analytical solutions of the eigenmodes and
eigenfrequencies exist. For more complicated systems one has to use numerical
methods as finite element techniques (see, e.g., Næss and Moan, 2013).
Consider the vertical beam illustrated in Figure 5.8. The beam may resemble
a simplification of a wind turbine tower with constant diameter and mass per unit
length. The beam has a rigid fixture at x = 0, implying that it cannot rotate at this level.
The mass per unit length of the beam is m. The damping is set to zero. Consider the
equilibrium of a short vertical section of length dx. The horizontal force acting on the
lower end of the section is denoted V. Similarly, the force at the top of the segment may
be written as V þ ∂V
∂x dx. Without any external force acting on the segment the differ￾ence between these two forces will cause an acceleration of the segment:

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.006 Published online by Cambridge University PressIf a continuous system, such as the above cantilever beam, is exposed to
a transient load or some initial displacements, several natural modes may be
excited. This is similar to what was observed in the two-body example shown
above. The natural modes are orthogonal, formally expressed as:
ð

ð Þx dx ¼ 0 for i ≠ j: ½5:33
This implies that oscillations in one mode shape do not couple into other mode
shapes. Further, a general oscillation may be solved by considering one mode shape
at the time and then making a summation of the modal responses to find the total
response. The dynamic response for each of the mode shapes may be considered as an
SDOF system, with unique modal mass, damping and stiffness. The initial displace￾ments and external forces are weighted by the modal shape functions to establish the
dynamic response of each mode. For example, if the cantilever beam above has an
initial displacement X0ð Þx and is excited by an external force F xð Þ ; t , then the initial
displacement for each mode and the modal excitation forces are given by:

From these expressions it is observed that the modal masses and stiffnesses using
orthogonal mode shapes are diagonal. For details about dynamic analysis using
modal superposition, see, e.g., Næss and Moan, 2013).
In analyzing wind turbines, a modal representation of the structure is frequently
used. Using a modal representation of the tower, only a few modes will be required
to obtain a reasonable representation of the dynamics, while if a finite element
representation is applied, many more degrees of freedom are needed. Analyzing the
dynamics of rotor blades involves special challenges, as the coordinate system of
the blade is rotating, and the centrifugal forces influence the stiffness and geometry.
The consequence is natural frequencies depending upon the rotational speed
(Skjoldan and Hansen, 2009).

Wave Loads on Fixed Substructures
This chapter discusses various ways to estimate the wave loads on offshore wind
turbines with bottom-fixed substructures. The most common wind turbine substruc￾ture currently uses monopiles, i.e., a vertical cylinders with constant diameter.
However, jacket (space-frame) structures consisting of several inclined circular
cylinders are also in use. Therefore, the general concept of computing wave loads
on such structures is discussed as well. The foundation of bottom-fixed structures is
addressed in short, in particular the various ways to include the forces from the sea
floor in the structural model.
Both fixed and floating substructures may be constructed from other-than￾cylindrical shapes. Therefore, methods for computing the wave forces on more
general geometries are addressed. These methods are examined further in Chapter 7
when discussing the dynamics of floating substructures.
6.1 General Principles of Computing Wave Loads on Small Bodies
Consider a body fully submerged in water, as illustrated in Figure 6.1. The force in
x-direction is obtained by integrating the pressure at the surface of the body times
the x component of the surface normal:
Fx ¼
ð
Sb
pnxdS: ½6:1
The integral must be taken over the complete wetted surface. Note that under the
assumption of an ideal fluid, the pressure only acts perpendicular to the wetted
surface. No shear forces are present. The pressure over the body may be obtained by
the Bernoulli equation. Ignoring hydrostatic effects and linearizing, the pressure is
obtained as:

: ½6:2
Here, ϕ is the velocity potential of the fluid flowing around the body. It is observed
that the velocity-squared terms disappear due to the linearization, thus there is no
(dynamic) pressure on the body unless there is a time variation in the velocity
potential.
Consider the two-dimensional (2D) flow around a circular cylinder. The free
flow far from the cylinder is in x direction and has magnitude U. If the cylinder
has radius R, the velocity potential can be written as:
ϕ ¼ U r þ R2

Here, r ¼ ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi

It is observed that the force is twice the force needed to accelerate the mass of fluid
displaced by the fluid. Considering the force in y direction, zero total force is
obtained.1 For geometries other than a cylinder, the factor will not be 2 and in the
general case the force may be written as:

Kutta–Joukowski condition and a lift force perpendicular to the incident flow was obtained.

U_ : ½6:5
The factor 1 corresponds to the force obtained by integrating the pressure in the fluid
undisturbed by the body. In the case of a cylinder in a uniform flow in x direction,
this corresponds to the contribution from the potential ϕ0 ¼ Ur cosθ ¼ Ux. When
considering wave-induced forces, the contribution to the force from the pressure in
the undisturbed wave field is frequently denoted as the Froude–Krylov force. Cm is
denoted as the added mass coefficient. This can be explained by considering the
acceleration of the body in x direction in a fluid at rest. The force needed to
accelerate the body is obtained as:
Fxa ¼ m þ CmρπR2  	x€: ½6:6
Here, m is the mass of the body and x€ is the acceleration of the body in x direction.
Thus, in addition to the force needed to accelerate the mass of the body itself, the
dry mass, an additional force is needed. This is related to the pressure distribution at
the body surface caused by the acceleration of the fluid surrounding the body.
The result in [6.5] was obtained by considering a flow field with a homogeneous
velocity distribution. In considering bodies in a wave field, the above expression
may be used under the approximation that the acceleration in the undisturbed wave
field is approximately constant over the volume of the body. This means that the
characteristic cross-sectional dimension of the body should be small compared to
the wavelength. For a circular cylinder, it is engineering practice to assume that this
criterion is fulfilled if the cylinder diameter is less than 1/5 of the wavelength.
6.2 Wave Forces on Slender Structures
6.2.1 Wave Forces on Vertical Cylinders: The Morison Equation
To arrive at the force in [6.5], an ideal, nonviscous fluid was assumed. Morison et al.
(1950) wanted to estimate the force on a vertical pile in waves. They proposed a simple
approach to account for the viscous effects2 by adding to [6.5] a term proportional to
the velocity squared. This formula was later named the “Morison equation”:
Fx2D ¼ ð Þ 1 þ Cm ρπ
D

ρCdDUjUj: ½6:7
2 The term “viscous effects” is sometimes used for the effects related to the shear forces along the body surface
only. The reduced pressure on the backside of a cylinder due to separated flow is frequently denoted as separation
effects. However, the origin of both is the viscosity. The viscous effects in the Morison equation are dominated
by separation effects.
186 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.007 Published online by Cambridge University PressHere, D is the cylinder (pile) diameter and Cd is the drag coefficient. Fx2D is the 2D
force on the cylinder, or the force per unit length in the 3D case. The absolute value
of the velocity is introduced to secure that the force is acting in the direction of the
fluid velocity. In the case of a cylinder oscillating in a fluid at rest, the force needed
to drive the oscillation is similarly given by:
Fxa2D ¼ m2D þ Cmρπ
D
2
 2 !x€ þ

2
ρCdDx_jx_j: ½6:8
Here, m2D is the mass per unit length. One may say that Morison equation adds two
asymptotic expressions, the force on the body in a fluid of zero velocity and finite
acceleration and the force in steady flow with no acceleration. As shown above,
Cm ¼ 1 and Cd ¼ 0 for a circular cylinder deeply submerged in an ideal fluid.
However, in a real fluid, the value of the two coefficients depends on the flow
conditions. In a fluid at rest and harmonic oscillations of the body, the key
parameters defining the flow condition are the Reynolds number Re ¼ x_AD=ν;
the Keulegan–Carpenter number KC ¼ x_AT=D ¼ 2πxA=D; and the surface rough￾ness expressed by k=D. Here, ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid; the index A
denotes amplitude; T is the period of oscillation; xA is the amplitude of oscillation;
and k is a characteristic roughness of the cylinder surface. The Reynolds number is
a measure of the turbulence level in the boundary layer at the cylinder. In a steady
flow, the flow separation and thus the drag coefficient are very sensitive to the
Reynolds number. At the critical Reynolds number in the range 105
–106
, depending
upon surface roughness, large changes in the drag coefficient are experienced. The
Keulegan–Carpenter number is an expression of the amplitude of oscillation versus
the diameter of the cylinder. It can either be an oscillation of the cylinder in a fluid at
rest or an oscillation of fluid around a body at rest. How well the separated flow is
developed depends upon the Keulegan–Carpenter number. For large Keulegan–
Carpenter numbers the separated flow is similar to steady flow conditions. For
further details and advice on drag and inertia coefficients for slender structures,
textbooks and standards should be consulted (e.g., Sarpkaya and Isaacson, 1981;
Faltinsen, 1990; DNV, 2021c).
Consider a vertical cylinder mounted at the sea floor and extending through the
sea surface, as illustrated in Figure 6.2. The diameter of the cylinder may be
assumed to be small relative to the wavelength. Thus, the Morison equation should
apply. However, the amplitude of the wave particle velocities decays with depth.
The approach used to handle this case is called “strip theory.” In strip theory, we
consider a small vertical section of the cylinder of length dz. In the Morison
equation only the flow perpendicular to the cylinder is considered. Thus, the
Wave Loads on Fixed Substructures 187
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.007 Published online by Cambridge University Pressforce on this small section is given by Fx2Ddz. The total force on the cylinder in x
direction is obtained by integrating from the sea floor to the mean free surface:
Fx ¼

Fx2Ddz: ½6:9
Similarly, the overturning moment about the sea floor is obtained as:
Md ¼
ð
0
d
Fx2Dð Þ z þ d dz: ½6:10
In [6.9] and [6.10] the integration is performed up to z ¼ 0. This is consistent with
linear wave theory. For the acceleration term, this is fine as the horizontal fluid
acceleration is maximum as the wave elevation is zero. However, the horizontal
velocity in the wave is maximum when the wave elevation is maximum. Thus, there
may be a significant difference in the horizontal force, and in particular the overturn￾ing moment, if the drag force is integrated to z ¼ 0 or to the instantaneous free
surface elevation. Integrating beyond z ¼ 0 implies that a choice of kinematic model
must be done. This is in particular an issue in irregular waves (see Chapter 2).
6.2.2 Wave Forces on Inclined Cylinders
The Morison equation is used also for inclined cylinders, e.g., to compute the wave
forces on jacket (“space-frame”) structures, as illustrated in Figure 6.3. The
Morison equation gives the forces perpendicular to the cylinder only. The forces
in the axial direction due to the viscous forces of the flow in the axial direction are
normally ignored. The approach used is to consider the components of the fluid

(see Figure 6.4), compute the normal force and integrate over the length of the
cylinder. This approach is considered valid if the flow direction does not deviate too
much from perpendicular to the axis. If the deviation is large, however, the normal
forces are small anyhow.
In integrating the force along the inclined cylinder, one must account for
variation in acceleration and velocities due to the position dependence of the
wave kinematics in x direction as well as the depth dependence.
The axial force on a cylinder may be estimated by using a Froude–Krylov
approach. I.e., the axial force is estimated by assuming the pressure in the undis￾turbed wave is acting in the axial direction on each end surface, given that the end
surface is wetted. If the end surface is not wetted, the axial force is zero.

In the above implementation of the Morison equation, it was assumed that the flow was
2D over every cross-section of the cylinder. However, if the cylinder has finite length
and one or both ends are in the fluid, the flow close to the ends will have a three￾dimensional (3D) component. This effect is frequently expressed through a 3D correc￾tion to the added mass coefficient; see, e.g., DNV (2021c). Considering an acceleration
of a cylinder of length L perpendicular to the axis, the corresponding inertia force may
be written as:

The value of α as function of the diameter over length ratio is illustrated in Figure 6.6.
Note that by this correction, only the total force integrated over the length of the
cylinder is obtained. To obtain the sectional forces, other 3D methods are needed; see
Section 6.4. If the fluid is free to flow around both ends of the cylinder, the length to be
used in Figure 6.6 is equal to the physical length of the cylinder. If, however, one end is
connected to a structure such that the flow around the end of the cylinder is restricted,
a “flow mirror effect” is obtained. This mirror effect causes the hydrodynamic length to
be used in Figure 6.6 to be twice the physical length. E.g., when considering the added
mass for the cylinder in Figure 6.5, the correct α-value is obtained by considering
D=2L in Figure 6.6. If both ends of the cylinder are attached to large bodies, the 2D
value of the added mass applies corresponding to D=L ≃ 0.
6.3 Wave Force on Non-Slender Vertical Cylinders: MacCamy
and Fuchs Theory
It has so far been assumed that the cylinder is slender in the sense that the undisturbed
fluid acceleration and velocity can be assumed to be constant over the diameter of the
section considered. If the diameter of the cylinder increases, this assumption fails.

moment on a vertical, circular cylinder can be derived analytically in the linear wave
case. This was done by MacCamy and Fuchs (1954).
Consider a linear harmonic wave propagating in the positive x direction and
a vertical cylinder with diameter D ¼ 2R located at x ¼ y ¼ 0, as illustrated in
Figure 6.2. The velocity potential as function of horizontal radius from the cylinder
axis, depth and time can be written (MacCamy and Fuchs, 1954; Sarpkaya and

The right-hand side of [6.13] may be replaced by an infinite sum of Bessel functions
(see, e.g., Abramowitz and Stegun, 1970), resulting in the first term of the summa￾tion in [6.12].
The second term in the summation in [6.12] represents the diffraction potential,
i.e., the waves diffracted from the cylinder. Note that the expression contains the
derivative of the Bessel and Hankel functions. The derivative of the Bessel function
of first kind and order m is given by Jm

a vertical circular cylinder with diameter 8 m. A water depth of 30 m is used. It is
observed that for wavelength to diameter ratio λ=D > 5, the long wavelength theory
compares well with the MacCamy and Fuchs theory. For shorter waves, the
deviation is, however, significant. If drag forces are added, the force using the
Morison equation depends upon the drag coefficient used as well as how the wave
kinematic is extrapolated above the mean free surface.
In comparing the long wavelength limit for the MacCamy and Fuchs theory
with the long wavelength approach, it is observed that for long wavelengths

6.4 Bodies of General Shape
Fixed-substructure wind turbines in most cases are mounted upon monopiles or
various kinds of slender space-frame structures as jackets. The wave forces are thus
estimated using the Morison equation or the MacCamy and Fuchs method, as has
already been discussed. However, a great variety of substructures have been
proposed, as illustrated in Chapter 4. In most cases floating substructures are
assembled from slender, horizontal pontoons and vertical columns. Both the pon￾toons and the columns may have a cross-sectional area that varies along its length.
In addition, flat solid or perforated plates may be introduced to obtain the wanted

have a barge-like shape. To estimate the wave forces on a long, slender structure of
general cross-section, “strip theory” methods as discussed in Chapter 7 can be used.
These methods have some similarities with the beam element momentum (BEM)
methods used in aerodynamics, as discussed in Chapter 3. Both assume a local 2D
flow over the structure. By the “strip theory” approach, forces on the total structure
as well as sectional forces may be obtained. The sectional forces are needed for
computing local bending moments and shear forces. The strip theory assumes no
hydrodynamic interaction between neighboring strips or between the various
structural components.
To compute the linearized wave forces on a body of general shape, where neither
the small body approximation nor the slender body approximation will work, linear
potential theory methods based upon the application of Green’s identity, so-called
panel methods as described by Newman and Sclavounos (1988), are usually
applied. The basic principles for these methods are based upon the panel methods
developed by Hess and Smith (1962) for the aero industry. However, the presence
of free surface waves adds some complications. Details on the 3D panel method are
described by Newman and Sclavounos (1988) and Faltinsen (1990).
The basic concept is based upon linear wave-body interaction assuming potential
flow and stationary conditions. The problem is solved in the frequency domain. The
boundary problem considered is illustrated in Figure 6.8. The velocity potential in
the fluid surrounding the body considered is denoted Φ ¼ Re φeiωt f g. As all terms
contain the factor complex eiωt
, only the complex amplitude of the potential φ is
considered in this section. The fluid is assumed to be ideal, irrotational and
incompressible, and the potential thus fulfils the Laplace equation in the fluid
domain:
∇2
φ ¼ 0: ½6:17
Further, as the problem is assumed to be linear, the velocity potential describing the
flow around a 3D rigid body oscillating in an incident wave field may be divided
into three main components: one potential describing the undisturbed incident
waves; one potential describing the disturbance, the scattering, due to the presences
of a rigid body at rest; and one potential describing the flow effect due to motion of
the body, the radiation:
φ ¼ φI þ φS þ φR: ½6:18
The scattering potential φS and the incident potential φI are frequently summed and
denoted as the diffraction potential, φD ¼ φI þ φS. The incident potential is dis￾cussed in Chapter 2. The radiation potential may be split into six contributions, one
194 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.007 Published online by Cambridge University Pressfrom each of the six rigid-body modes of motion. As the potential for each mode of
motion is proportional to the velocity of the body in that mode, it is convenient to
write:
φR ¼ iω
X
6
i¼1
ηi
φi
: ½6:19
Here, ηi is the complex amplitude of the motion in mode i. Referring to Figure 6.8,
the boundary conditions for the velocity potentials are obtained as follows. At the
flat bottom the normal velocity must be zero, i.e.:
∂φ
∂n ¼ ∂φ
∂z ¼ 0 at z ¼ d: ½6:20
As the water depth tends toward infinity, this boundary condition is replaced by the
requirement that the gradient should tend to zero as z tends toward minus infinity.
On the body surface Sb a similar zero normal velocity condition must be required
for the diffraction potential:
∂φD
∂n ¼ 0; ½6:21
while for the radiation potential it must be required that the normal velocity of the
water at Sb must equal the normal velocity of the body. This is required for each of
the six modes of motion:

components n ¼ fn1; n2; n3g. The rotational components are defined by
ð Þ¼ n4; n5; n6 x  n, where x ¼ ð Þ x; y;z is the coordinates of the body surface
point considered. At the free surface SF the same linearized boundary condition
is valid as for the incident waves (see Chapter 2):

φ ¼ 0 at z ¼ 0: ½6:23
Far away from the body, at S∞ a radiation requirement is imposed on the scattering
and radiation potentials. This condition implies that the potentials should represent
outgoing waves far away from the body.
In state-of-the-art computer programs, e.g., WAMIT (2016), the potentials are
solved by invoking Green’s second identity, relating integrals over the fluid volume
and the surface enclosing the volume:

Ω is the fluid volume considered and S is the surface enclosing the volume. Ψ is
a “help function,” normally denoted as Green’s function, which also satisfies the
Laplace equation except in one singular point P1 . In the case of an infinite fluid
volume without boundaries, except at the body surface, ψ ¼ 1=r with r equal to the
distance from P1 to the point entering into the integration. 1=r is the potential for
a source with strength 4π in an infinite fluid, the “Rankine source.” If the fluid
volume is a half-space, e.g., an infinite fluid volume above a flat bottom located
at z ¼ 0, a Green’s function ψ ¼ 1=r þ 1=r0 may be used. Here, r0 ¼ ½ð Þ x  ξ 2 þ

; see Figure 6.9. By introducing this Green’s function, it is
observed that the boundary condition ∂ψ=∂z ¼ 0 at z ¼ 0 is satisfied. By construct￾ing a Green’s function satisfying all the boundary conditions except at the body
considered, it can be shown that the contributions to the surface integral in [6.24]
from all boundaries except the body surface Sb vanish. An artificial small surface
(sphere) around the singularity P1 is introduced to ensure the validity of the volume
integral. The radius of the sphere is infinitesimal. The result from [6.24] is
obtained as:

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.007 Published online by Cambridge University PressWhen a free surface is present, the Green’s function ψ becomes much more
involved than the potential corresponding to the pure Rankine source. In addition
to the Rankine part, a singular integral over all wavenumbers is to be included. For
the infinite water depth case the Green’s function may be written (Newman and
Sclavounos,1988) as:

P1. J0 is the Bessel function of first kind and order zero. Great care must thus be
taken in implementing this Green’s function to ensure accuracy as well as reason￾able computational times. For details on the free surface Green’s function and its
numerical implementation, see Wehausen and Laitone (1960), Newman (1985) and
Faltinsen (1990).
With P1 located in the fluid domain, the potential in the point Pð Þx is obtained by
introducing [6.26] into [6.25]. To do so, the potential distribution over the body
surface is needed. If Pð Þx is at the body surface, the following result is obtained for
the potentials at this location:

potential at all points along the body surface interacts. The right-hand side of the
equations in [6.27] are known, as is the derivative of the Green’s function on the
left-hand side. To solve for the total potential, the integrals may be replaced by
a summation over the body surface.
The body may be divided into N flat, quadrilateral panels as illustrated in
Figure 6.10. If the potential is assumed to be constant over each panel, and the
distance is calculated to a central point at each panel, [6.27] may be reformulated to
a set of equations with N unknowns:

The integration takes place over each panel surface Sk located at ξ and the
functions are evaluated at the collocation points, representing geometrical
mid-points, of the panel j, located at xj. In most implementations, the
Rankine part of the Green’s function is integrated analytically over the flat,
quadrilateral panels, while the wave part of the Green’s function is evaluated
between the collocation points.
To achieve high accuracy in this approach, a large number of panels may be
needed. Close to sharp corners and close to the free surface special care should be
used to ensure sufficiently small panels to represent the rapidly changing strength of
the potential. The panel size has also to be small relative to the wavelength
considered. Figure 6.10 shows an example of the discretization of a spar-floating
substructure. A large number of panels increases the computational time signifi￾cantly. To improve the accuracy without increasing the number of panels too much,
198 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.007 Published online by Cambridge University Presshigher-order panel methods3 may be applied. Such methods may allow for non-flat
panels and a variation of the potential strength over the panels. Details of one such
method may be found in the WAMIT Manual (2016).
It has so far been shown how the velocity potential in the fluid may be found.
This is a convenient approach when the pressure distribution is sought for as the
dynamic pressure is proportional to the velocity potential:

3 “Higher-order panel methods” must not be confused with “higher-order solutions.” The former refers to the
representation of the panel surface as well as the distribution of the potential over the panel. Thus, the panels may
not be flat and the potential may not be constant over each panel. The problem considered is still linear from
a hydrodynamic point of view. However, higher-order hydrodynamic problems and solutions (in particular
the second-order problem) may also be solved by boundary integral methods. The higher-order solutions use
a Taylor expansion to account for finite body motions and wave heights. In this case integration over the free
surface is also required, increasing the complexity of the numerical problem considerably.
Wave Loads on Fixed Substructures 199
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.007 Published online by Cambridge University PressHowever, if accurate estimates of the fluid velocities are of importance, it may be
preferred to solve for the source strength at each panel. The approach is similar to
solving for the velocity potential (Newman and Sclavounos, 1988).
One of the nice things about using the boundary element method is that only the
wetted body boundary needs to be discretized. However, solving for the problem in the
exterior fluid domain, an internal, artificial problem is solved at the same time. For
bodies piercing the water surface, this may cause some challenges. The internal
problem is a homogeneous “Dirichlet” problem corresponding to φ ¼ 0 at the internal
surface. This problem exhibits eigenfrequencies that may disturb the results for the
exterior problem. These frequencies are denoted as “irregular frequencies.” The
location of the irregular frequencies for a general body cannot be found analytically.
However, for a vertical circular cylinder and a rectangular barge, simple expres￾sions exist (see Hong, 1987; Korsmeyer, Newman and Sclavounos, 1988). For the
vertical cylinder, the irregular frequencies are located at Jnð Þ¼ kR 0, where R is
the cylinder radius and k is the wave number corresponding to gravity waves at the
depth of the cylinder. Jn is the Bessel function of first kind and order n. For
n ¼ 0; 1; 2; 3 the zeros of the Bessel function of first kind are found
at kR ¼ 2:4048::; 3:8317::; 5:1356::; 5:5200::.
For the rectangular barge with constant draft h the irregular frequencies are found

6.5 Effects of Steep Waves
6.5.1 Drag Forces
The above derivations of wave forces are based upon linear wave theory. That
implies that the structure considered is assumed to be wetted to the mean water only
level even in a wave crest. Thus, when integrating the pressure to obtain the forces,
the upper limit is taken at the mean free surface level. For vertical columns with
inertia-dominated loads, where the acceleration term dominates over the drag or
wave radiation terms, the approach of integrating to the mean free surface is good as
the maximum load occurs as the wave elevation is close to zero. However, for drag￾dominated structures, the maximum force occurs as the wave amplitude is at the
200 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.007 Published online by Cambridge University Pressmaximum, and the contribution from the drag force in the region from the mean free
surface level to the actual wave elevation becomes significant. An approximate way
of estimating this contribution to the drag force can be made as follows. Consider
the drag term in [6.7]. Integrated from the mean free surface level to the actual wave
elevation, the contribution to the horizontal force becomes:
FFS ¼
ð
ζð Þt
0
1
2
ρCDDU zð Þj ; t U zð Þj ; t dz: ½6:32
The maximum horizontal wave particle velocity coincides with the maximum wave
elevation. Using the linear expressions for the velocity and wave elevation, we
obtain the following approximate value of the maximum force:
FFSð Þ max ≃
1
2
ρCDDω2
ζ 3
A: ½6:33
Here, ζA is the wave amplitude. It is observed that this force contribution is
proportional to the third power of the wave amplitude. It is thus of increasing
importance as the wave height increases. In [6.33] the linear value of the maximum
horizontal wave particle velocity is used. As has been discussed in Section 2.2, the
real maximum velocity in steep waves exceeds the linear value. [6.33] thus
underestimates the real maximum drag force. Further, the choice of a proper drag
coefficient in the splash zone is a nontrivial issue.
6.5.2 Slamming
When the wave becomes very steep, the particle velocity in the wave crest may
exceed the phase speed of the wave and the wave breaks. Such a development is
simulated by, e.g., Vinje and Brevig (1980) and is illustrated in Figure 6.11. From
a force perspective, the situation with an almost vertical wall of water hitting the
column represents the most severe situation. In this case, water with high velocity
hits a large length of the column almost simultaneously. As breaking starts (see the
lower two frames in Figure 6.11), the local particle velocities may become even
larger, but the water hits the column on a more limited area. Further, after breaking,
air will normally mix into the water, contributing to a reduced impact pressure.
The situation with an almost vertical “wall of water” hitting the column is
called slamming and resembles the more common slamming situation when an
(almost) flat body hits a horizontal water surface at high speed. A classical
problem considered is a horizontal circular cylinder moving toward a calm
free surface at constant speed, as illustrated in Figure 6.12. In this situation,

time. The vertical hydrodynamic force on the cylinder, ignoring viscous
effects, can then be expressed by:

the cylinder as function of the submergence s. In the initial phase of the impact, it is
assumed that U is almost constant and thus the acceleration dependent force is

mass. The key challenge is to estimate the added mass as function of submergence.
For practical purposes, the derivative of the added mass is frequently expressed by
a slamming coefficient:

2 ρD ; ½6:35
where D is the cylinder diameter. Classical theoretical derivations (see, e.g.,
Faltinsen, 1990), give the initial value of Cs, i.e., the value just after touching
water. The so-called von Kármán (1929) solution gives Csðs ¼ 0Þ ¼ π . In the von
Kármán approach the deformation of the free surface is ignored. In the Wagner
(1932) approach, the deformation of the free surface, and thus the increased wetted
length, is accounted for and Csðs ¼ 0Þ ¼ 2π is obtained. Most experiments result in
values between these two theoretical values. A frequently used relation for the
slamming coefficient is proposed by Campbell and Weynberg (1980):

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.007 Published online by Cambridge University PressThe three expressions for the slamming coefficient are illustrated in Figure 6.13.
Other expressions for the slamming coefficient have also been proposed. For an
overview, see, for example, DNV (2021c).
To compute the horizontal slamming load of a steep wave impacting upon
a vertical column, Kalleklev and Nestegård (2005) recommend using the slamming
results for calm water, as illustrated in [6.36]. They use a strip theory approach and
divide the vertical column into three zones, as illustrated in Figure 6.14. Strips in
Zone 1 are not exposed to water and have thus zero load. Strips in Zone 2 are
partially submerged, and the slamming formulation in [6.34] is used together with
a proper slamming coefficient. For strips in Zone 3 the Morison equation is applied.
As discussed in Chapter 2, great care should be used in estimating the wave particle
kinematics. This is in particular the case for waves close to breaking (see
Figure 6.11). The approach proposed by Kalleklev and Nestegård (2005) assumes
that the horizontal component of the wave particle velocity is constant during the
wetting phase. The effect of vertical run-up, a 3D effect, is ignored. This effect
increases as the diameter of the cylinder increases.

Another transient wave load phenomenon that may excite resonant response of
a vertical column is ringing. Ringing is caused by nonlinear effects in waves that
typically are much longer than the column diameter. Perturbations up to third order
in the wave steepness are used for estimating the wave kinematics to be input to
computation of the ringing loads (see, e.g., Faltinsen et al., 1995; Krokstad et al.,
1998; Grue and Huseby, 2002). Slamming causes a classical transient dynamic
response in which the first transient response amplitude is the largest, and the
following response amplitudes have gradually decaying amplitudes. The ringing￾induced dynamic response, on the contrary, typically builds up over a few resonant
cycles to a maximum response, and thereafter decays gradually. An example of
measured ringing response is shown in Figure 6.15, which illustrates the response
of the first bending mode of a wind turbine mounted on a monopile in 27 m water
depth and exposed to steep waves. The natural frequency of the first bending mode
is 0.29 Hz, while the wave spectrum has a peak frequency of 0.1 Hz. Figure 6.15
shows the characteristic ringing response triggered by a steep wave, which builds
up over a few cycles before it dies out slowly. The natural frequency of the response
is close to three times the peak frequency of the waves. For a further discussion of
the experiments, see Suja-Thauvin et al. (2017).

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.007 Published online by Cambridge University PressBoth slamming and ringing are caused by steep waves and may cause large
resonant response amplitudes. However, the response dies out after a few cycles.
Springing is a stationary response phenomenon experienced in long structures such
as large ships. The bending modes of the structure may be excited by both linear and
nonlinear wave loads. For the excitation to take place, both the wavelength and the
frequency of the excitation forces must correspond to the mode shape and natural
frequency of the structural mode. For offshore wind turbines, springing may thus be
relevant for long horizontal structures such as pontoons or stiffeners.
6.6 Modal Loads
The dynamics of continuous systems are discussed briefly in Chapter 5. As most
bottom-fixed wind turbines are mounted on monopiles, the contribution to inertia,
damping and excitation forces due to waves may be obtained from the MacCamy
and Fuchs solution or the Morison equation. The horizontal force and the overturn￾ing moment from waves are given in [6.14] and [6.15]. If the excitation of elastic
mode-shapes is to be considered, the following approach may be used.
Denote the mode shape considered Ψjð Þz . This may be elastic bending mode j of
the monopile-tower structure. The modal inertia for mode j due to the surrounding
water may then be written as:
Ajj ¼ ρπR2
ð
LW
Ψ2
j ð Þz Cð Þ 2D

Here, Lw is the length of the wetted part of the monopile. A constant radius R is
assumed. Using a long-wavelength approximation, the 2D added mass coefficient
Cð Þ 2D
m ¼ 1 may be used. Similarly, the modal wave excitation force is obtained as:
Fj ¼
ð

Ψjð Þz Fð Þ 2D ð Þz dz: ½6:38

Here, d is the draft of the monopile; R is the radius; ζA is the wave amplitude;
and CM is given by [6.15]. For modes 1 and 5 (overturning moment about the sea
floor), the mode shapes may be written as Ψ1ð Þ¼ z 1 and Ψ5ð Þ¼ z α5ð Þ z þ d
respectively. The mode shape of an elastic beam fixed at the sea floor may be
approximated by a parabola:4 Ψ7ð Þ¼ z α7ð Þ z þ d 2 . The α-values must be chosen
so that the mode shape has a proper value at its maximum. If the first elastic
mode is chosen to have a unit displacement at the nacelle level,
Ψ7ðznacelleÞ ¼ 1, the scaling factor becomes α7 ¼ 1=ð Þ znacelle  zbottom

.
Figure 6.16 displays the mode shapes for rigid-body pitch and simplified elastic
bending modes. Both are given a unit displacement at the waterline, z ¼ 0 . In the
same figure, the computed modal loads are also shown as function of wavelength
over diameter. The wave loads are computed by the MacCamy and Fuchs approach.
It is observed that except for cases with very short waves, the modal load in pitch is
larger than the modal load in bending. This is explained by the fact that the bending
mode shape function is less than the pitch mode shape function for all vertical
positions. For very short waves, the modal loads are almost equal. This is because
short waves act close to the waterline only and here both modal functions have
a value close to unity.

Wave Loads on Fixed Substructures 207
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.007 Published online by Cambridge University PressEffect of Water on the Modal Mass
Assume the monopile as well as the tower may be modeled as a vertical cylinder with
radius 2.5 m and wall thickness 0.055 m. The water depth is d ¼ 22m and the vertical
coordinate of the nacelle is at zn ¼ 75m. The elastic bending mode shape is approxi￾mated by a parabola and unit displacement at nacelle level, i.e.:
Ψ7ð Þ¼ z z þ d
zn þ d
 2
: ½6:41
The mode is denoted mode 7. The structural mass of the tower plus monopile down to
the sea floor becomes m ¼ 2πRtρstð Þ¼ zn þ d 657:8  103
kg. The density of steel is set
to 7850 kg=m3. The modal mass of the tower plus monopile for the above elastic
bending mode becomes:

With a mass of the nacelle and rotor assembly equal to 250  103
kg, the total modal
mass of the structure becomes 381:6  103
kg. The monopile may be assumed to be filled
with water up to the still water level; further, using a 2D added mass coefficient of 1.0,
the contribution from external and internal water to the modal mass becomes:

I.e., the contribution from the internal and external water is only 0.12% of the
contribution from the steel and the top head mass. This is explained by the fact that the
modal displacement at the waterline is only 5.1% of the top displacement.
Even if the hydrodynamic contribution is negligible to the modal mass, the wave
excitation force may be significant, in particular if the wave frequency is close to the
modal natural frequency.
6.7 Modeling of Bottom Sediments
The purpose of a monopile is to secure the wind turbine to the sea bottom.
Monopiles are driven, most frequently by hammering, down into the bottom
sediments. The required diameter and the length the monopile to be driven
into the sediments depends upon the stiffness and strength characteristics.
The sediments may consist of layers of silt, clay and sand, all with different
208 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.007 Published online by Cambridge University Pressproperties. The stiffness properties with respect to horizontal displacement are
essential in determining the eigenfrequencies for the elastic bending modes of
the wind turbine. For a modern HAWT with a variable rotor speed control,
one should avoid eigenfrequencies coinciding with the rotational frequency
(1p) and three times this frequency (3p) for a three-bladed rotor. As the
variable speed range increases, the gap between the highest values of 1p
and the lowest values of 3p decreases, as illustrated in Figure 6.17. The
rotational speed for modern 6–8 MW turbines may be in the range of 5–12
rev/min, corresponding to 1p in the range of 0.08–0.2 Hz.
Frequently the design of the monopile-tower structure is such that the
eigenfrequency of the first bending mode is located in the gap between
the 1p and 3p ranges. Using the above approximate numbers, this means
that the first elastic eigenfrequency should be within the range 0.2–0.24 Hz
(see, e.g., Kallehave et al., 2015). Thus, very accurate estimates of the
eigenfrequencies are required, with a corresponding requirement for an accur￾ate estimate of the sediment stiffness. The second eigenfrequency is normally
designed to be above the 3p range.5
In industry it is common to denote the tower as “stiff” or “stiff-stiff” if the first
eigenfrequency is above the 3p range. If the first eigenfrequency is below the 1p
range, the tower is denoted as “soft” or “soft-soft.” With the first eigenfrequency in
the range between 1p and 3p the tower is denoted “soft-stiff.” As the size of the
turbines increases, the 1p frequency is reduced. Thus, using a “soft-stiff” design of
the tower, the first eigenfrequency may be in the wave frequency range.
Three ways of modeling the pile–sediment interaction are used in design, as
illustrated in Figure 6.18. The three options are as follows.
1p 3p Rotor frequencies
Figure 6.17 Illustration of ranges of the rotor frequency (1p) and three times the
rotor frequency (3p) for a variable-speed HAWT.
5 This discussion considers only deformation in one plane. In a full 3D case there will be bending modes both in
the direction of the rotor axis and perpendicular to the rotor axis. The mode shapes and eigenfrequencies in
the two directions may differ a little due to differences in the inertial contribution of the rotor in the two
directions.
Wave Loads on Fixed Substructures 209
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.007 Published online by Cambridge University PressRigid fixation at sea-bottom level disregards the stiffness and damping effects of
the sediments. The modal shape will have zero displacement and inclination at the
sea floor (see Section 5.4). This approach will overestimate the stiffness corres￾ponding to the first eigenfrequency. The overestimation of the stiffness may be
corrected for by moving the point of fixation to a level below the sea floor.
Another option is to represent the sediments by a linear and a rotational spring at
the sea floor level. This approach accounts for the effect of the sediments in an
integrated manner. To determine the magnitudes of the springs, the soil properties
along the pile must be known. Damping may be introduced in a similar way.
A more complete representation of the sediments is by a distribution of springs
(and dampers) along the full length of the pile. The stiffness at each level should
represent the stiffness of the sediments at that location. For that purpose, data based
upon a 2D analysis of a cylinder in the soil may be used, i.e., a strip approach. The
continuity between the layers is accounted for by the elastic deflection of the pile.
This approach requires detailed knowledge of the sediments at all levels, and
accurate mode shapes and eigenfrequencies may be obtained. For further details,
see, e.g., Aasen et al. (2017).
The material properties of the sediments have a very nonlinear behavior. The
relation between load and deflection in the material may be represented by so-called
“p-y curves.” The “p-y curve” represents in this case the relation between the force

“p-y curve” is shown in Figure 6.19. The solid line shows the load deflection for
a monotonic increasing displacement. It starts out from zero with almost a linear
relationship, then gradually the stiffness of the material is reduced, and the slope of
the curve decreases. At some point, “A” in the figure, the displacement is assumed
to be reversed, and an almost linear curve is followed until the nonlinearities again
become significant. At “B,” the displacement again is reversed.
A cyclic deformation pattern will thus follow a curve like the dashed curve in
Figure 6.19. From this curve a hysteretic behavior is observed, causing energy
dissipation during cyclic loading. The area of the loop increases as the amplitude of
the motion increases. This implies increased damping as the motion amplitude is
increased. If the displacements are within the almost linear range of the “p-y curve,”
the damping contribution is almost negligible. For further discussion of the import￾ance of soil modeling and damping contribution from the soil, reference is made to
Aasen et al. (2017) and Carswell et al. (2015).

Floating Substructures
As energy production from offshore wind expands, new and deeper ocean areas are
being considered for development. As discussed in Chapter 4, floating support
structures should be considered for water depths beyond 50 m. Floating support
structures introduce several new aspects with respect to dynamic behavior com￾pared to bottom-fixed support structures. These aspects will be discussed in more
detail in this chapter.
The starting point is equations of motion for a rigid body in six degrees of
freedom (6DOF). The forcing mechanisms from waves are addressed as well
as the inertia effects due to the surrounding fluid, the added mass, hydrostatics
and the effect of mooring. The effect of wind forces is discussed in Chapter 3.
This chapter further discusses the combined effect of wind forces and the
motion control system.
Floating support structures can take several geometric shapes. Various methods
for computing the wave loads on rectangular pontoons, barges etc. will therefore
be outlined in more detail. In Chapter 6, the boundary element method for
computing wave loads on a 3D body of general shape was discussed. This method
is well suited also for floating bodies. However, simpler and computationally
faster methods are useful in the design process, in particular for optimization
purposes. Therefore, strip theory methods are outlined in some detail. Most of the
derivations in this chapter are based upon linear methods. This implies that forces
are computed at the initial or mean position of the structure, and that inertia,
damping and restoring effects are also linearized and referred to the initial or
mean position. The linearization also implies that all dynamic rotations of the
support structure are assumed to be small. The linearization makes the computa￾tions efficient and allows for solving the dynamics in the frequency domain.
However, in real design processes the importance of various nonlinear effects
must be assessed.
213
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressFor floating support structures, a great variety of shapes have been proposed, as
illustrated in Chapter 4. In most cases the floater is assembled of slender horizontal
pontoons and vertical columns. Both the pontoons and the columns may have a
cross-sectional area that varies along the length. In addition, flat solid or perforated
plates may be introduced to obtain the wanted dynamic characteristics of the floater.
Some floating foundations have a barge-like shape; thus, the applicability and
accuracy of the various methods must be evaluated for each case. For example, in
a preliminary design phase involving an optimization process, strip theory methods
may be applied. Having concluded on a geometry, the results obtained by strip
theory should be compared to results obtained by 3D methods.
7.1 Wave-Induced Motions: Equations of Motion
Considering the six rigid-body degrees of motion, the dynamic equations may be
written as:
ð Þ M þ A η€þð Þ BvþBr η_þð Þ CmþCh η ¼FwaþFwiþFcuþFwt: ½7:1
Here, η is the vector of the six degrees of motion, as illustrated in Figure 7.1.
The figure also shows the common naming convention for the motions. The
linear motions in direction ð Þ x; y;z are denoted η1; η2; η3 ð Þ and the rotations
about the ð Þ x; y;z axes are denoted η4; η5; η6 ð Þ. It is here is assumed that the
ð Þ x; y -plane coincides with the mean water surface and that z is vertical, zero at
the mean free surface and positive upward. M is the 6 x 6 dry mass matrix of the
complete wind turbine and A is the hydrodynamic mass matrix. The damping
matrix is split into two parts, the radiation part, Brð Þ x; y;z , related to wave gener￾ation, and the remaining damping, Bv, mainly linearized viscous damping from
water and air. The damping could also contain effects due to the control of
the wind turbine, but these effects may also be included in the forcing term.
The restoring matrix is split into a hydrostatic part, Ch, and a mooring part,
Cm. The four excitation force vectors are the wave force vector; the wind
force on the structural parts; the current force; and the force due to the
action of the wind turbine.
If the equations are linearized, [7.1], and a stationary, dynamic response is
considered, the force vector may be written as F ¼ FAeiωt and the response as
η ¼ ηAeiωt
, where ω is the frequency of oscillation and ηA is the complex
response vector. The equation of motion in frequency domain may thus be
written as:
ω2
½M þ Að Þ þ ω iωBð Þþ ω Cgηð Þ¼ ω Fð Þ ω :  ½7:2
214 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressHere, it is indicated that in the general case, the added mass as well as the damping are
frequency-dependent. The frequency domain format of the equation of motions is
useful when wave forces dominate the excitation. If significant nonlinear effects are
present, which is the case for wind turbines during operation and active control
functions, the equations must be written and solved in time domain. If the hydro￾dynamic forces are assumed to be linear but frequency-dependent, a convolution
integral is needed in the time domain version of the equations to account for the
frequency dependence. In time domain the frequency dependence represents a memory
effect. In the 1D case the equation of motion in time domain may then be written as:
ð Þ M þ A∞ η€ þ
ðt
0
h tð Þ  τ η τ _ð Þdτ þ Cη ¼ F tð Þ: ½7:3
The convolution term now accounts for the frequency dependency of added mass
and damping (these are related) and A∞ is the high-frequency limit of the added
mass. Further discussion of time domain formulation of the equation of motion with
frequency-dependent coefficients is found in, e.g., Falnes (2002). Further details
are given in Section 7.4.8.

In many of the proposed designs for offshore wind support structures, the floater is
composed of slender horizontal pontoons and vertical columns. Both the pontoons
and the columns may have a cross-sectional area that varies along its length. In
addition, flat solid or perforated plates may be introduced to obtain the wanted
dynamic characteristics of the floater.
There are two main options to obtain the added matrix for such structures: strip
theory or 3D ideal fluid theory based upon, e.g., boundary element techniques, as
discussed in Chapter 6. Strip theory approach will be addressed here.
7.2.2.1 Vertical Columns
Consider a slender, circular and vertical column of constant radius R and extending
from zb to zt, where zb < zt ≤ 0. The cylinder axis is located at ð Þ xc; yc . The added
mass for linear motion in the horizontal direction can then be approximated by:
Ah ¼ Að Þ 2D ð Þ¼ zt  zb πρR2
CahL; ½7:7
where the length of the column is L and Cah is the 2D added mass coefficient for the
cylinder. The added mass for oscillation in the vertical direction can similarly be
written as:
Av ¼ ð Þ Cavb þ Cavt πρR3
: ½7:8
Here, the indices b and t refer to the bottom and top of the column respectively. If
the column pierces the free surface, Cavt ¼ 0, and if the column is sitting on top of a
pontoon, Cavb ¼ 0. If two columns are sitting on top of each other, an approximate
value for the added mass contribution at the junction may be applied; see Section

It should be kept in mind that in this derivation it has been assumed that the 2D
added mass is equal at all sections, i.e., no end effects are accounted for when
integrating the 2D added mass along the column. If end effects are to be accounted
for, the various terms involved should be obtained from [7.7] and [7.11] by
performing integration along the axis and accounting for variation in Að Þ 2D .
The added mass related to the end surfaces of a long slender cylinder is
frequently taken to be the mass of a half-sphere with the same radius as the column,
i.e., Cav ¼ 2=3. If two columns are located on top of each other, a rough estimate of
the vertical added mass can be obtained by setting the vertical added mass for the
surface of the column with the smallest diameter to zero and for the column
with the largest diameter to the difference between two half-spheres. I.e.,

7.2.2.2 Horizontal Pontoons
Consider a horizontal pontoon of rectangular cross-section extending from ðx1; y1;z1Þ
to ðx2; y2;z2Þ, see Figure 7.8. As the pontoon is horizontal, z1 ¼ z2 ¼ zp. To establish
the added mass matrix in this case, we employ strip theory once more. The pontoon is
split into short transverse sections over which the flow is assumed to be 2D. It is
assumed that the 2D added mass in the horizontal and vertical direction differs, i.e.,
Að2DÞ
h ≠Að2DÞ v . Further, the added mass in the axial direction due to the end surfaces of the
pontoon may be included. Consider a section of length ΔL of the pontoon. The mid￾point of the center axis through the section is located at ð Þ x; y;z . The pontoon axis
forms an angle α with the x-axis. Considering an acceleration in x direction η€1, the
forces acting on the fluid in direction 1, 2 and 3 due to this acceleration are:
ΔF11 ¼ anAð Þ 2D
h sin α ¼ η€1 sin α Að Þ 2D
h sin α ¼ η€1Að Þ 2D

ΔF21 ¼ anAð Þ 2D
h cos α ¼ η€1Að Þ 2D

ΔF31 ¼ 0:

The same procedure applies for the two other directions. Integrating over the length
of the pontoon thus gives the following added mass matrix for linear translations

in axial direction is 2Ae. The angle of the pontoon relative to the x-axis is given by

  and L is the length of the pontoon.
Considering rotational acceleration around the x-axis, and the resulting moments
about the other axes ΔL, the following contributions are obtained:

pressure in axial direction and only if they are wetted. However, if the pontoon is
attached to a column, as illustrated in Figure 6.5, one will normally ignore the effect of
the pontoon when considering the added mass of the column. Thus, one should evaluate
if the total added mass is better represented by considering the pontoon ends to be wet or
dry. This may be done by using a 3D panel method. The contributions from a wetted end

Added Mass of a Horizontal Pontoon
Consider a horizontal pontoon with length L ¼ 30 m, width B ¼ 5 m and height
H ¼ 3 m. The axis of the pontoon is 8.5 m below the free surface. The 2D added mass in
vertical and horizontal direction for the pontoon section is estimated to be
Að Þ 2D
v ¼ 1:67HB and Að Þ 2D
h ¼ 0:72HB respectively. The added mass of the end sections,
Ae, is ignored in this example. The pontoon is located with one end of the axis at
ð Þ x ¼ 10 m; y ¼ 0 m; z ¼ 8:5 m . The angle between the pontoon axis and the
x-axis is 30 deg; see Figure 7.2.
The 6 × 6 added mass matrix is computed using the strip theory approach as well as
using a 3D boundary element method as described in Section 6.4. The distribution of
the quadrilateral, constant potential boundary elements are shown by the black lines in
Figure 7.2. Note that the panel sizes are reduced toward the edges of the pontoon. This
is to improve the computational accuracy. The 3D method accounts for the free surface
effect. The added mass thus becomes frequency-dependent. In Table 7.1, the added mass
matrix as obtained by strip theory as well as 3D results at a low frequency (0.087 Hz)
and a high frequency (0.5 Hz) are presented. The matrix is symmetric. In general, the
strip theory method and 3D results do not differ much. One exception is A11, which is
sensitive to the added mass related to the end surfaces. This effect was ignored in the
strip theory method example.

7.2.2.3 Horizontal Disks
In some cases, the substructures are equipped with horizontal plates of almost
circular shape and with small thickness (as discussed in Section 4.4.1). The
reason for using such plates is to tune the dynamic behavior of the platform.
The plates will add inertia to the system, thus moving the natural periods in
heave, roll and pitch to higher values. At the same time, plates with sharp
edges will contribute to viscous damping and thus reduce the motion response
in the resonant domain. To improve the damping properties, perforation of the
plates is an option. A perforation will, however, reduce the added mass effect
of the plate (Molin and Nielsen, 2004).

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressThe added mass of a circular disk with radius R oscillating in infinite fluid is
given by Lamb (1975, 144):
An ¼ 8

ρR3
: ½7:27
In most cases, the plate will be located at the bottom of a vertical column. In
such cases the added mass will be somewhat smaller, depending upon the ratio of
the disk radius to the column radius (see discussion on vertical columns in Section
7.2.2.1).
Figure 7.3 shows examples of the importance of the perforation to the added
mass and linearized damping. The figures are from Molin and Nielsen (2004). The
nondimensional added mass and damping is presented as a function of the “porous
Keulegan–Carpenter number”:

Here, τ is the perforation ratio (open area divided by total area of disk) and μ is the
“discharge ratio”, relating the pressure drop over the disk and the relative fluid
velocity through the disk. It is thus related to the flow resistance through the disk,
which again is dependent upon the local geometry of the perforation. μ usually has a

the discharge ratio. It is observed from Figure 7.3 that for small KCpor, the added
mass as well as the damping tends to zero. This case corresponds to a situation with
a very large perforation area, τ → 1. On the one hand, as τ → 0 the added mass tends
toward the solid disk value of [7.27]. The computed damping tends to zero because
the damping due to the edge effect of the disk is not accounted for in this theory.
Including the edge effect (see Molin, 2011), a better agreement with the experi￾ments is obtained for the damping.
7.2.2.4 Transformation of the Added Mass Matrix to a New Coordinate System
Frequently the added mass matrix is computed in a local coordinate system, for
example, as referred to the center axis of a column or pontoon. For further
analysis a different platform coordinate system may be preferred. The trans￾formation between the two coordinate systems may be done as follows. Denote
coordinates in the original (local) coordinate system by x0 ¼ ðx0; y0;z0Þ and the
new (platform) coordinate system by x1 ¼ ðx1; y1;z1Þ. Assume the two systems
are parallel, so that:
Δx ¼ x1x0 ¼ ð Þ Δx; Δy; Δz : ½7:29
The kinetic energy in the fluid while oscillating the body in a certain direction must
be independent of the coordinate system used. By considering the kinetic energy
using the velocity potentials, it can be shown that the 6 x 6 added mass matrix in the
new coordinate system, A1, is related to the added mass matrix in the original
coordinate system, A0, by:

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University Press7.3 Damping
The damping terms in [7.1] consist of several contributions that may be handled
independently. The following terms will be discussed in more detail.
• Linear radiation damping, related to the radiated waves.
• Viscous damping, mainly due to flow separation around the hull.
• Aerodynamic damping, due to the wind turbine, and to some extent the wind
forces on the tower.
Most floating structures are lightly damped. This means that the damped natural
frequencies are not very different from the undamped natural frequencies. This
implies that damping in most cases is important to the responses close to the natural
frequencies only. However, the damping is generally both frequency-dependent and
amplitude-dependent. This makes it difficult to establish accurate damping esti￾mates. Normally, good physical insight as well as engineering experience is
required to come up with realistic damping estimates. Frequently, model testing
is applied to study the motion behavior of floating structures. If the tested structure
is sensitive to resonant motion, model test results should be interpreted with great
care as viscous damping normally is overestimated in model scale as compared to
full scale.
7.3.1 Radiation Damping
Radiation damping is considered to be a linear damping contribution. For a general,
rigid floating structure the damping matrix will be a full 6 × 6 matrix with frequency￾dependent coefficients. To establish this damping matrix, a 3D radiation-diffraction
approach is needed (see Section 6.4). A structure’s capability to generate waves is
reduced if the structure is deeply submerged. This implies that a surface-piercing
vertical column generally contributes more to the wave radiation damping than, e.g.,
a horizontal pontoon. However, in a strip theory approach, the 2D damping of a
pontoon section may be applied to establish an estimate on the damping for the
complete pontoon. The horizontal, normal force on the pontoon due to a harmonic
motion ηn ¼ ηAneiωt normal to a section of the pontoon may be written as:

mass and damping are frequency-dependent. The radiation effect will only account for
waves radiated perpendicular to the pontoon axis. The 6 by 6 damping matrix can now
be established similarly as shown for the added mass matrix. A strip theory approach
accounts neither for the interaction of the radiated waves from each of the pontoon
strips, nor for the interaction between the pontoons. The interaction effects may in
some cases be significant for some frequencies and directions of oscillation.
Within the context of ideal fluid flow and linear wave dynamics, there exists a
reciprocity relation that relates the wave forces on a fixed body to the forces needed
to oscillate the body in otherwise calm water. This is called the Haskind relation (for
further discussion, see Newman, 1977; Faltinsen, 1990). The relation is valid for
general 3D bodies. Applying the Haskind relation on a vertical column with a
rotational symmetry, simple relations between the wave excitation forces and the
diagonal of the damping matrix are obtained:

The computation of the wave force on a vertical column is addressed in Chapter 6.
Note that for a substructure with several columns, there may be significant wave
interaction between the columns, modifying the radiated waves and thus the
damping. A summation of the damping contribution from each of the columns
will thus cause errors. One should rather make a summation of the radiated wave
fields, taking phases properly into account, and estimate the damping based upon
the radiated energy. This is what is obtained by using 3D potential theory methods.
The Haskind relation may also be invoked to estimate the radiation damping for
horizontal pontoons. Having established the wave excitation force on a segment dL
of the pontoon, the corresponding contribution to the damping may be obtained.
Newman (1962) derived a relation between the 2D wave force and damping for a
long horizontal body in deep water and beam seas. For a segment of the pontoon
this relation is identical to [7.35] using γ ¼ 1 and considering three degrees of
freedom: the transverse horizontal direction, the vertical direction and rotation
about an axis parallel to the body axis.
226 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University Press7.3.2 Viscous Damping
Viscous damping has contributions from all structural elements where flow separ￾ation occurs. Pure skin friction is in most cases so small that it may be disregarded.
The viscous force is normally expressed as a quadratic quantity with respect to the
relative velocity, i.e., on a short, 2D section of a vertical column, the viscous force
may be written as:
ΔFvisc ¼ 1
2
ρCDDUreljUreljΔz : ½7:36
Here, CD is the drag coefficient, D is the column diameter and Urel ¼ vh  x z _ð Þ is
the relative horizontal velocity between water and structure at the z-level con￾sidered. Δz is the length of the short vertical section considered. It is observed that
the viscous force contributes both to excitation via the v2
h term and damping via x_
2
h .
Further, there is a coupling term between the two that contributes to damping or
excitation depending upon the phase between the wave particle velocity and the
motion velocity.
7.3.3 Linearization of Viscous Damping
In linear dynamic analysis there is a need for linearization of the viscous effect. This
is in particular the case when accounting for viscous damping in frequency domain
analyses. Due to the nonlinear nature of the damping and the coupling to the fluid
velocity, i.e., wave particle and current velocities, it is in general not possible to
perform a consistent linearization of the viscous damping. However, disregarding
the fluid velocities and considering a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system, an
equivalent linear damping can be derived as follows. Consider a long slender
structure, e.g., a cylinder. Denote the 2D damping force acting normal to a short
section of length, dz by FBdz. The force is assumed to be composed of a linear and a
quadratic contribution, i.e.:
FBdz ¼ ðB1x_ þ B2x_jx_jÞdz: ½7:37
The body velocity normal to the cylinder axis is assumed to be harmonic, i.e.,
x_ ¼ ωxA sinð Þ ωt . To find the equivalent linear damping Be, the dissipation of
energy over one cycle of oscillation, T ¼ 2π=ω, is considered. By requiring the
dissipated energy to be the same for the equivalent linear system and the quadratic
system, Be is thus found from:

It is observed that the equivalent linear damping is proportional to the velocity
amplitude, ωxA. That implies that an iteration procedure usually must be imple￾mented to establish a proper damping estimate. As the damping is of key import￾ance to the resonant response, one will have to guess a resonant response amplitude,
estimate the equivalent damping, then compute the response and correct the
damping according to the computed response.
Viscous Damping
Consider the following simple 1D example. A small body is exposed to an oscillating
flow given by v ¼ vAexpðiωtÞ. The body is moving harmonically in the same direction
with a velocity x_ ¼ x_Aexp ið Þ ωt þ θ
 . The relative velocity is thus given by
Urel ¼ Refv  x_g . The viscous force is given from [7.36]. Considering one cycle of
oscillation, the average dissipated power becomes:

vA=x_A < 1, the damping (dissipated power) is positive independent of phasing between
the fluid motion and the body motion. However, for vA=x_A > 1, the damping may become
negative for certain phases, implying an excitation effect. For zero fluid velocity the
average dissipated power amounts to 4

The above procedure works fine for a SDOF and in cases where the various
modes of motion are uncoupled or close to uncoupled. For most substructures
the heave mode has little coupling to other modes, while, for example, the
surge and pitch modes may have significant coupling. Frequently the surge
motion is referred to the waterline level, while the eigenmode for pitch may
have a center of rotation far below the waterline. This causes a significant
coupling between the surge and pitch motion when viscous drag forces are
accounted for.
To illustrate this point, consider a spar platform designed as a vertical cylinder
with constant diameter and a pure surge motion. The drag forces in surge and pitch
may then be written as:
F1ðÞ¼ t C

Here, zt ¼ 0 and zb ¼ L are the top and bottom coordinates of the cylinder.

Similarly, integrating the pitch moment over one cycle of oscillation and comparing

From the above relations it is observed that the linearized damping depends upon
the choice of surge and pitch velocity amplitude used as basis for the linearization.
If one focuses on a good linearization of the pitch damping at the pitch natural
period, the coupling effect will cause damping also in surge that may be unrealistic.
To succeed in linearization of the damping, one should aim at reducing the coupling
terms in the damping matrix as much as possible. This is normally obtained by
using a coordinate system in which the modes of motions are close to the eigen￾modes of the system.
Viscous Damping in Coupled Motion
Consider a vertical cylinder with length equal to draft 100 m and diameter 10 m. Center
of gravity is at -70 m. The 2D added mass and drag coefficients are both set to 1.0. A
horizontal mooring system with stiffness 50 kN/m is attached at the waterline level. The
natural periods in surge and pitch are 118.6 and 17.70 s. The pitch eigenmode has a
center of rotation at z = -61.5 m. The linearized coupled damping matrix has been
established by assuming a surge amplitude of 0.7 m and a pitch amplitude of 0.5 deg.
The system is set into free oscillations in calm water. The initial surge amplitude is
1.0 m, while the initial pitch and all initial velocities are set to zero. Two cases are
considered, one using the quadratic damping and one using the linearized damping
matrix. Figure 7.5 shows the results for the two cases.
230 Offshore Wind Energy

It observed that the surge motion is well reproduced using the linearized damping
(upper-left), even if the surge damping force contains large contributions from the pitch
motion (lower-left). Initially, the pitch motion obtained by the linearized equations
follows the motions obtained by using quadratic damping well (upper-right). This is
because the inertia effects dominate initially. After a while, however, the pitch motion is
more and more dominated by the surge natural period in the linearized case. Large
differences are also observed in the pitch drag moment (lower right).

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University Press7.3.4 The Drag Coefficient
In most practical cases, the viscous forces are related to the pressure distribu￾tion over the structure due to flow separation. That implies that the drag
coefficient, CD, depends upon the body geometry, including surface roughness
as well as flow conditions. The flow conditions are expressed via three
nondimensional numbers: the Reynolds number, Re ¼ UD
ν ; the Keulegan–
Carpenter number, KC ¼ UAT
D ; and the relative current number, ¼ Uc=UA . Here,
U is a characteristic flow velocity; UA is the amplitude of the oscillatory velocity,
either of the body or the flow; Uc is a steady current velocity; D is a characteristic
cross-sectional dimension of the body; ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid; and
T is the period of oscillation. Thorough discussions of the relations between these
parameters and the drag coefficient are given in, e.g., Sarpkaya and Isacsson (1981)
and Faltinsen (1990). Recommended values to be used are found in, e.g., DNV
(2021c).
For circular cylinders the drag coefficient is sensitive to where flow separation
takes place, which again is sensitive to all the above parameters. For cross-sections
with a rectangular shape, the drag coefficient is less dependent upon the flow
conditions as flow separation occurs at the sharp corners. Classical results for the
drag coefficient for a 2D circular cylinder in steady flow as a function of the
Reynolds number are shown in Figure 7.6. A drop in the drag coefficient for

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University Pressthe Reynolds number in the order of 105 is observed. As the surface roughness of
the cylinder increases, the drop occurs at a lower Reynolds number, and is less than
for a smooth cylinder.
7.4 Wave Excitation Forces
7.4.1 Slender Bodies of General Shape
The estimation of wave excitation forces on floating substructures is now to be
addressed. As for the discussion on the added mass coefficients above, structures
composed of slender vertical cylinders and a horizontal pontoon using strip theory
will be addressed. One of the advantages with this approach is that it is straightfor￾ward to use in a finite element analysis of the structure based upon beam elements.
However, the global forces are focused upon here as these are needed for estimating
the rigid-body motions. Some floating substructures may have a barge-like shape
(see Section 4.4.4). To estimate the wave forces on such structures, 3D methods as
discussed in Chapter 6 should be used.
As for the added mass, the forces need to be referred to a common point of
reference. Further, by using the strip theory approach, it is assumed that the flow
over any cross-section of the columns or pontoons may be considered to be 2D,
even if the cross-sectional dimensions are changing. No hydrodynamic interaction
is assumed between the various structural components.
In computing the six degrees of freedom of rigid-body wave forces, it may be
convenient to refer to a coordinate system located at the mean sea surface, with
z ¼ 0 at the surface level and positive upward.
7.4.2 Wave Forces on a Vertical Column
Consider regular waves propagating in direction β relative to the x-axis. The
complex wave potential may, see Chapter 2, be written as:
ϕ ¼ igζA
ω
cosh½k zð Þ þ d
coshð Þ kd eiðωtkx cosβky sinβÞ
: ½7:45
There are two options to estimate the wave force on a vertical circular
column. One may either assume a very slender column, with no diffraction
effects, and apply the Morison equation or one may include diffraction effects
and apply the MacCamy and Fuchs theory. Both these approaches are dis￾cussed in Chapter 6. However, the expressions need to be modified to account
for the fact that the column does not extend to the sea floor. Using a strip
theory approach, this implies that the sectional force is integrated from the
Floating Substructures 233

assumed that the column axis is located in ð Þ xc; yc . Similarly as for the monopile,
the surge and sway forces are now obtained as:
F1 ¼ πρgR2ζACm

F2 ¼ πρgR2

sinhð Þ kst sinhð Þ ksb
coshð Þ kd  eið Þ ωtþδkxccosβkycsinβ sinβ: ½7:46
Here, Cm and δ are given in [6.15], st ¼ zt þ d and sb ¼ zb þ d. It is observed that
the forces have an extra phase shift as the column is offset from x ¼ y ¼ 0 . The
vertical force may be estimated using the pressures from the undisturbed wave, the
Froude-Krylov pressure at the bottom and top surfaces of the column, i.e.:
F3 ¼ πρR2 γb
∂ϕð Þ zb
∂t  γt
∂ϕð Þ zt

¼ πρgR2
ζA
γbcoshð Þ ksb γt
coshð Þ kst
coshð Þ kd  eið Þ ωtkxccos βkycsin β : ½7:47
If the column is surface-piercing, zt ¼ 0, there is no wave pressure on the top end
and γt ¼ 0. Similarly, if the column is sitting on the bottom, γb ¼ 0. For wetted end
surfaces, γ ¼ 1. Note that a bottom-fixed vertical cylinder piercing the free surface
is not exposed to vertical wave forces.
The moments about the x- and y-axes are obtained similarly as in [6.15] and
[6.16]; accounting for the horizontal offset, the direction of the waves and that the
moment axis is now at the free surface level, the roll and pitch moments are
obtained as:

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressThe last term in the above expressions is due to the moment contribution from the
vertical wave force on the column. Note that in the deep-water case, d → ∞,
sinhðksÞ=coshðkdÞ →coshðksÞ=coshðkdÞ →ekz .
The moment around the z-axis, the yaw moment, is obtained from the horizontal
forces:
F6 ¼ F1yc þ F2xc: ½7:49
All the above expressions are valid for one single column. If several columns are
present, the total force is obtained by summation over all the columns. If a column
diameter is changing over the length of the column, a pragmatic approach is to split
the column into, e.g., two parts and compute the force on each of the parts
separately. This is illustrated in Figure 7.7. The split may be done into two or
more parts. To obtain a realistic model, the body volume should be conserved. The
vertical wave force at the conical part of the column may be modeled by the wave
pressure at the area representing the difference between the cross-sectional area of
the cylinders. The modeling of this force may be improved by representing the
conical section by more cylinders.
If the distance between the columns is not large compared to the diameter of the
columns, the interaction effect may be important. In such cases, a full 3D analysis
should be performed to obtain accurate estimates on the wave forces.
7.4.3 Wave Forces on a Horizontal Pontoon
Horizontal pontoons in most cases either have a circular or a rectangular
cross-section. In the case of a rectangular cross-section the added mass
coefficient in horizontal and vertical directions differs. Consider the horizontal
Figure 7.7 Vertical column with conical section modeled by two cylindrical
sections.
Floating Substructures 235
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University Presspontoon illustrated in Figure 7.8. A slender body is assumed, implying that the
length of the pontoon is much longer than the characteristic cross-sectional
dimension. Further, long wavelength theory is used, implying that the wave￾length is much longer than the characteristic width of the pontoon. Following
the principles outlined in Faltinsen (1990), the vertical and horizontal forces
on a 2D section of length ΔL may be written as:
ΔFn ¼ ρAp þ Að Þ 2D
n
h ianΔL
ΔFv ¼ ρAp þ Að Þ 2D
v
h iavΔL:
½7:50
Here, Ap is the cross-sectional area of the pontoon; Að Þ 2D n is the 2D added mass in
horizontal direction, normal to the pontoon axis; Að Þ 2D v is the 2D added mass in
vertical direction; an and av are the acceleration in the water horizontally, normal to
the pontoon axis and in vertical direction respectively.
To obtain the total forces on the pontoon, the forces in [7.50] have to be
integrated over the length of the pontoon. To perform this integration, it is conveni￾ent to introduce the local ð Þ s; n coordinates, as illustrated in Figure 7.8. The
relations between the two coordinate systems are:
s ¼ x cosα þ y sinα
n ¼ x sinα þ y cosα: ½7:51
The coordinates of the end points of the pontoon axis are thus:
s2 ¼ x2 cosα þ y2 sinα
s1 ¼ x1 cosα þ y1 sinα

component of the horizontal acceleration, an, and the vertical acceleration, av in
[7.50], that vary along the pontoon length. The horizontal acceleration perpendicu￾lar to the pontoon axis may be written as:

attached to column of larger diameter. The end of the pontoon is then dry. On the
other hand, part of the column surface is also dry. It is thus convenient to model both
surfaces as wetted. This will almost cancel the global force contribution from the
intersection. If local forces are required, this approach will not work.
The vertical force on the pontoon is obtained in a similar way as the horizontal
force, i.e., using:

Horizontal Wave Force on Pontoon
An example of the computed horizontal force on a pontoon of length 30 m in a wave of
length 15 m is shown in Figure 7.9. The force perpendicular to the pontoon axis is shown.
The force is given as a function of the angle between wave propagation and the pontoon
axis. By presenting the result in the format Abs½Fn=sinð Þ β  a sinð Þ β  a , the sign of the
force relative to the pontoon normal axis is retained. It is observed that the extreme
forces are obtained for ð Þ¼ β  α ±90o . Further, zero force is obtained for waves
propagating along the pontoon axis. For ð Þ¼ β  α ±60o
additional zero values appear.
For these angles one wavelength will cover the full pontoon length, i.e.,

7.4.5 Viscous Drag Effects
The viscous forces, as written in [7.36], contain the relative velocity between
water and structure. For a slender vertical structure, this reads Urel ¼ vh  x_.
Here, vh is the horizontal component of the fluid velocity and x_ is the horizontal
velocity of the structure. The viscous drag forces are frequently estimated using a
strip theory approach, assuming the length of the structure is much larger than the
characteristic cross-sectional dimension. The drag force on a strip of a vertical
structural member thus becomes, assuming the fluid velocity is larger than the
structural velocity:
ΔFD ¼ 1

v2 represents an excitation term, while the two remaining terms may represent
damping, i.e., a force opposing the motion or an excitation, depending upon the
phasing between the velocity components and the relative magnitude between
them. In waves, the largest velocities are present close to the free surface, and the
240 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University Presslargest viscous excitation effects are thus present in this region. At greater depth,
the viscous damping effect may be more important. In the above expression, the
horizontal relative velocity is used to estimate the normal force. For a slender
structural member of general orientation, one should use the relative velocity
component normal to the axis of the member in estimating the force. This “cross￾flow principle” is normally assumed to hold if the flow direction is between 45 and
90 deg relative to the member axis (DNV, 2021c). In DNV (2021c) additional
recommendations on how to handle the viscous drag forces are also given. In
Section 6.5.1, the viscous wave forces in the splash zone are discussed. The same
effects are experienced on columns of floating structures, with the additional effect
of the motion velocity of the structure.
Due to the nonlinearity of the viscous forces, time domain simulations are
normally required in cases where the viscous effects play an important role in the
forcing.
7.4.6 Cancellation Effects
In the design of floating support structures, the geometric layout can efficiently be
utilized to minimize the wave excitation loads at certain frequencies. Consider the
simple half of a semisubmersible in Figure 7.10. The half semisubmersible consists
of two columns and one pontoon. It is assumed that the columns are sitting on top of
the columns. Assume the waves’ direction of propagation is perpendicular to the
paper plane. The undisturbed pressure in the water, the Froude–Krylov term in the
wave excitation pressure, is then constant along the length of the pontoon. The
vertical force acting on the semisubmersible is approximately given from the
Froude–Krylov pressures acting on the top and bottom of the pontoon multiplied
by corresponding areas:
F3 ¼ pBAB  pTAT: ½7:64
Here, AB and AT are the wetted area of the bottom and the top of the pontoon
respectively. In deep water the pressure is given from p ¼ ρgζAekzþiωt
. Thus, the
force becomes zero for a wave number k given by:
k ¼ lnð Þ AB=AT
zT  zB
: ½7:65
The difference between the top and bottom areas is given from the cross￾sectional area of the columns. By choosing a suitable column cross-sectional
area, pontoon dimensions and submergence, a wanted wave period for
Floating Substructures 241
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University Presscancellation may be obtained. It is observed that this expression also holds if
the platform consists of two parallel pontoons. In the case of two parallel
pontoons, there will also be a close-to-zero vertical excitation force if the
distance between the pontoons is half a wavelength. However, as the zero
vertical force corresponds to a wavelength about half the distance between the
pontoons, this wavelength will cause a maximum in the roll motion of the
structure.
Consider waves propagating in the paper plane (Figure 7.10). If the
wavelength is approximately twice the distance between the columns, the
horizontal acceleration in the wave acting on the two columns will have
opposite phase. Thus, a close-to-zero horizontal excitation force is acting on
the platform. It should be noted that wavelengths that correspond to close-to￾zero wave excitation forces on the complete structure in many cases corres￾pond to the wavelengths giving the largest internal forces in the structure.
This is easily understood by considering the case of opposite phase of the
forces on the two columns.
For the spar platform, the lower part of the hull is normally designed with
larger diameter than the diameter at the water line (see Figure 7.7). This
difference in diameter is required to ensure a sufficient buoyancy while at
the same time keeping the natural frequency in heave below the range of wave
frequencies. As for the pontoon, the vertical excitation force may be approxi￾mated by the Froude–Krylov force on the bottom of the spar minus the
vertical component of the Froude–Krylov force acting on the conical part,
simplified as illustrated in Figure 7.7 (right). Thus, a cancellation effect of the
vertical wave force is obtained for a certain wave frequency. In principle it is
possible to design both a semisubmersible and a spar to have a cancellation
frequency at the heave natural frequency. Theoretically, this could significantly

option is not used in practical design.
7.4.7 Wave Forces on Large-Volume Structures: Boundary Element
Method
The basic principles for the 3D boundary element method are outlined in
Section 6.4. In Table 7.1, the added mass and damping for a horizontal pontoon
as computed by strip theory and a 3D boundary element method are compared. In
the below example the corresponding wave excitation forces are compared.
One may question why strip theory approaches should be used when full
3D tools are available. There are several reasons for this. Strip theory is much
faster, both in establishing the numerical model and performing the computa￾tions. This feature makes the method well suited for use in optimization tools.
Further, it is easy to identify the added mass and excitation force components
related to the various structural components. Further, strip theory is ideal for
implementing hydrodynamic forces into a program for global structural ana￾lysis of the foundation as the sectional forces are readily available. However,
the 3D boundary element technique is superior in computing the hydro￾dynamic loads for complex structures accounting for interaction phenomena
between the various structural components.
Wave Forces on a Horizontal Pontoon
The horizontal pontoon used in the example in Section 7.2.2.2 is considered.
The wave forces are computed both using strip theory, using the added mass
coefficients from the previous example, and using the 3D boundary element
method.
The draft and orientation of the pontoon is as before. Water depth of 100 m is
assumed. The waves are propagating in positive x-direction. The real and
imaginary part of the wave forces in the six degrees of freedom as a function of
frequency is obtained as displayed in Figure 7.11. The solid lines are the real
part of the forces as computed by strip theory; the dashed lines are the
corresponding imaginary part. The dots and crosses are the results from the 3D
boundary element method. The forces are scaled by a factor ρgζ AB2 for the linear
forces. ζ A is the wave amplitude. The moments, computed around origin, are scaled
by ρgζ AB3
.
A clear cancellation effect is observed for modes 1–3 around 0.25 Hz, corresponding
to a wavelength of about 26 m, which is the projected length of the pontoon in the
direction of wave propagation.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University Press7.4.8 Time Domain Simulations with Frequency-Dependent Coefficients
As briefly mentioned in Section 7.1, the hydrodynamic added mass and damping
coefficients are frequency-dependent. The frequency dependency of the added
mass is frequently ignored if the structure is slender or deeply submerged (see
discussion of the Morison equation versus the MacCamy and Fuchs solution in
Chapter 6). The frequency dependence of the hydrodynamic coefficients is related
to body’s capability to generate waves when oscillating. Thus, there exists a relation
between the frequency-dependent part of the added mass and the wave radiation
damping.
One of the attractive properties of the linear formulation of the hydro￾dynamic coefficients and excitation forces is the option of solving the equa￾tions of motion in the frequency domain. However, even if it may be justified
to linearize the hydrodynamic problem, that may not be the case for other
parts of the problem such as the aerodynamic loads. The equations of motion
for the complete floating wind turbine must thus be solved in time domain.
This requires special attention to the frequency-dependent added mass and
damping. The problem was addressed by Cummins (1962) and Ogilvie (1964).
Falnes (2002) and Naess and Moan (2013) also discuss how the frequency￾dependent hydrodynamic coefficients may be transferred to time domain. In
time domain, the linear equations of motion may be written (the “Cummins
equation”) as:
ð Þ M þ A∞ η€ðÞþt
ðt
0
Kð Þ t  τ η_ð Þτ dτ þ CηðÞ¼ t Fð Þt : ½7:66
K is known as the retardation function or the impulse response function. The
equation is obtained by a Fourier transform of the linear equations of motion in
frequency domain:
ω2
½M þ Að Þ þ ω iωBð Þþ ω Cgηð Þ¼ ω Fð Þ ω :  ½7:67
The added mass and damping coefficients are spit into a constant and a frequency￾dependent term, Að Þ¼ ω A∞ þ A0
ð Þ ω and Bð Þ¼ ω B∞ þ B0
ð Þ ω . Here, the index ∞
denotes the asymptotic value as the frequency tends to infinity. For a stationary
body, i.e., a body with zero mean forward speed, B∞ ¼ 0, no waves are created as
the frequency of oscillation tends to infinity. The integral term in [7.66] may be
regarded as a memory effect, as it contains information of all past time. It may be
assumed that the body is as rest for t < 0. Further, the causality condition is invoked,
i.e., the system cannot react upon future forces. Utilizing symmetry properties of
Floating Substructures 245
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressAð Þ ω and Bð Þ ω , and the requirement that K must be real, it can be shown that the
retardation function can be written on two different forms, using either the radiation
damping or the frequency-dependent part of the added mass:
KðÞ¼ t

½Bð Þ ω cosð Þ ωt dω
¼  2
π
ð
∞
0
ω½Að Þ ω A∞ sinð Þ ωt dω:
½7:68
These expressions also show that the damping and the frequency-dependent
part of the added mass are both related to the body’s ability to radiate waves
when oscillating. More details upon these issues are found in Falnes (2002).
In principle, it is thus straightforward to obtain the retardation
function if the frequency-dependent added mass or damping are known, e.
g., from a boundary element panel code analysis. However, such codes have
issues related to so-called “irregular frequencies” (see Section 6.4) and low
accuracy as the wavelength approaches the size of the panels. Thus, to
establish the high-frequency limit of the added mass may involve some
challenges. For further discussion of these issues, see Faltinsen (2005).
The convolution integral in [7.66] may be costly to evaluate, in particular
for long simulations and thus large t. In practical simulations the integration
is truncated. The memory effect is assumed to negligible after some finite
time. Various ways to speed up the evaluation of the convolution
integral for implementation in state-space simulation models have been
suggested. Duarte et al. (2013) compare several methods for approximating
the retardation functions and discuss accuracy as well as computational
speed.
Figure 7.12 gives examples of the frequency-dependent radiation damping
and the corresponding retardation functions. The structure considered is
a spar platform with shape as given in Figure 6.10. For such a geometry,
it is straightforward to obtain an accurate estimate of the radiation damping.
For a semisubmersible with a more complex geometry, this is more demand￾ing. It is observed that the retardation functions as shown in Figure 7.12
tend to zero after a few oscillations. After approximately 30 s, the
retardation functions are approximately zero and the memory effect has
vanished.

The restoring forces acting on a floating wind turbine substructure are due to the
hydrostatic effects and the mooring lines. The hydrostatic forces are, for normal
motions, assumed to be linear. The 6 x 6 hydrostatic stiffness matrix may be written as:

stiffness matrix is symmetric. For a freely floating body ρV ¼ M and
ðxG; yGÞ¼ðxB; yBÞ, several of the off-diagonal terms in [7.69] thus become zero.
This is, however, not the case if the static mooring forces are significant as
compared to the buoyancy force. It is assumed that M is a rigid mass, i.e., there is
no fluid that may move inside the body.
7.5.2 Effect of Catenary Mooring Lines
The geometry and loads in catenary mooring lines are discussed in Section 7.6. The
restoring forces are generally very dependent upon the pretension and offset of the top
end of the mooring line. However, given a certain position of the top end, the linearized
contribution to the stiffness matrix from each of the mooring lines may be computed as
follows.
Initially the line is assumed to give restoring effects resulting from motion in the plane
of the catenary only. The catenary line is assumed to be located in a local ð Þ x;z plane
with origin in the upper end of the mooring line. The 3 x 3 restoring matrix for each line
Cð Þl has thus only the following non-zero elements:Cð Þl
11;Cð Þl
13 ;Cð Þl
31; Cð Þl
33 . The local plane
is rotated an angle θ about a vertical axis relative to the global coordinate system. The
restoring force matrix in a coordinate system parallel to the substructure’s coordinates
then becomes:

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University Press7.5.3 Effect of Tether Mooring
Tether mooring systems normally consist of one or more vertical lines with
pretension (see Chapter 4). The pretension level is governed by the design require￾ment that the line should never go slack. Tether mooring has for a long time been
applied on offshore oil and gas platforms. The advantage of using tether mooring is
that the heave, roll and pitch motions are all very small, i.e., restrained modes. In the
oil and gas industry, this has opened up the option of having dry well-heads on a
deck of floating platforms. Tether mooring is normally combined with a hull design
that minimizes the dynamic wave loads in the tethers. In contrast to catenary
mooring lines, tether mooring implies permanent vertical loads on the anchors.
This calls for special anchor designs, for example, bucket or gravity anchors with a
submerged weight at least equal to the pretension in the tether.
A challenge using multiple tethers (three or more) for floating wind turbines is the
large overturning moment due to the wind thrust on the turbine. This overturning
moment is Mw ¼ TwH, where Tw is the wind thrust and H is the vertical distance
between the rotor axis and the point of attachment of the tethers. Using four tethers in
a square layout as an example, the force in each of the tethers to compensate for the
overturning moment amounts to Ft ¼ Mw=2Dt ¼ TwH=2Dt. Here Dt is the distance
between the tethers. Thus, the dynamic loads in the tethers increase with the H=Dt
ratio. For most wind turbines H >> Dt, implying large dynamic load variations in
the tethers as compared to the dynamic wind thrust. This put requirements to the
pretension in the tethers which again may be a driver for the buoyancy of the
substructure and the size of the anchors.
The 3 x 3 (surge, sway, heave) restoring matrix for one single tether, referred to
the top end of the tether, is:

the platform origin, the symmetrical 6 x 6 restoring matrix becomes:

The main purpose of a conventional mooring system is to keep the floating structure
at location, i.e., to avoid drift-off due to mean forces from wind, waves and current.
Except for tether systems, used for tension leg platforms, mooring systems are
normally not designed to restrict the dynamic wind and wave forces. A mooring
system should thus be sufficiently strong to take the maximum average plus slowly
varying forces, and at the same time sufficiently compliant to avoid extreme loads
due to dynamic offset. The force-displacement characteristics of mooring lines are
normally very nonlinear, as illustrated in Figure 7.13, which shows how a certain
horizontal mean force (in this case approximately 2400 kN) corresponds to a certain
static horizontal offset of the top end of the mooring line (fair lead). In this specific
example the fair lead position is offset by approximately 620 m from the anchor
position. Adding wind- and wave-induced horizontal motions on top of the mean
offset, the corresponding mooring line tension will vary according to the nonlinear
force-displacement characteristic. It is observed that if the mean force increases, the
tension amplitude corresponding to a certain motion amplitude will increase. Mean force

Figure 7.13 Force-displacement characteristic for a mooring line of length
627.0 m in unstretched condition. The top end is located 71.2 m above the sea
floor. Submerged weight per unit length is 2.46 kN/m. The axial stiffness EA =
892.6 MN. The x-axis gives the horizontal distance from the anchor location to the
top end (fair lead). The vertical arrow indicates a mean load in the line and the
corresponding mean distance from the anchor. The dot-dashed horizontal line
indicates a double amplitude of wave- and wind-induced motions, causing the
tension in the line to vary between the values given by the stars.

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressTo avoid excessively large extreme load amplitudes and to ensure that the anchor
can withstand the loads, it is normally required that the length of the mooring line
shall be sufficient to ensure that the mooring line force at the anchor position acts as
a purely horizontal force, even during extreme load cases.
The pretension is important to ensure a proper stiffness in yaw for a floater. In the
case of a vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) the mooring system must also resist
the generator torque. This puts special design requirements on the mooring system.
If a VAWT is placed on top of, e.g., a spar platform, and the mooring lines initially
have a radial pattern, the torque will cause a rotation of the foundation until the
mooring line tension component in the circumferential direction balances the
generator torque. At the same time the turbine mean thrust load must be carried
by the lines.
7.6.1 The Concept of Effective Tension
Before discussing the geometric and restoring characteristics of mooring lines, the
concept of “effective tension” will be explained.
Hydrostatic forces arise due to the pressure acting on the surface of a body. The
total hydrostatic force vector is given by integrating the pressure over the wetted
surface:
Fhs ¼
ð
Sw
pndS: ½7:77
Here, Sw is the wetted area of the body and n is the unit surface normal vector. If the
body is fully submerged (or surface-piercing, with zero pressure at the free surface),
the surface fully encloses the volume of the body. In that case the surface integral
can be rewritten to a volume integral by observing that the hydrostatic pressure is
given from a potential field, and invoking the Gauss theorem, i.e.:
∯
Sw
pndS ¼ ∭
V
∇ pdV ¼ ρgVn3: ½7:78
Thus, a purely vertical buoyancy force is obtained. In the case of the cable and
considering a short segment, the segment is not wetted at the end surfaces. Thus, the
volume integral does not describe the hydrostatic effect and must be corrected for
missing pressure at the end surfaces. This correction is illustrated in Figure 7.14.
The buoyancy force is applied as if the end surfaces are wetted, i.e., [7.78] is used.
Next, the forces on the end surfaces are corrected to compensate for the missing
hydrostatic pressure. This introduces an additional axial tension amounting to peA.
This is not a physical tension creating stress in the line, but a correction term
entering the equations for the equilibrium of the line. Thus, in computing the axial
tension in computing the line geometry, the effective tension is to be used:
252 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressTE ¼ T þ peA: ½7:79
T is the tension as obtained using the forces acting at the ends of the line and a
submerged weight per unit length as given by w0 ¼ mg  ρgA. In [7.79] the hydro￾static pressure is denoted pe to show that this is an external pressure. For pipelines, a
similar correction is obtained considering the effect of the internal pressure.
Assume the line segment has a length Δs0 at zero tension. Under tension the
length is Δs. The strain is then given by ε ¼ ð Þ Δs  Δs0 =Δs0. However, also the
external pressure influences the axial strain of the segment. For a cylindrical body
exposed to external pressure pe on the sides and an axial tension T, the linear axial
strain is obtained as:
ε ¼ 1

both material-dependent. Small strains are assumed, and thus a linear stress-strain

length Δs. Case A shows the real pressure distribution. Case B gives the same net
forces as Case A. Case B may be replaced by Case C plus Case D. Case C
represents a fully wetted segment with vertical force ρgAΔs. The end forces in
Case D are the needed correction forces, peA. A is the cross-sectional area of the
line and pe is the external hydrostatic pressure.
1 The Poisson’s ratio, after the French mathematician and physicist Siméon Poisson, is a measure of the
deformation of a material perpendicular to the direction of loading. If a rod has an axial load causing an axial
strain ofεa, then the change in transverse dimension is given by εn ¼ νεa, where ν is the Poisson’s ratio. Thus, if
the Poisson’s ratio is positive, a stretching of the rod will cause a transverse contraction.
Floating Substructures 253
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University Pressrelation may be assumed. For steel within the elastic range of deformation the
Poisson’s ratio is approximately 0.3, while for synthetic ropes it is close to 0.5. A
Poisson’s ratio of 0.5 implies that the line, within a first-order approximation,
conserves the volume when tensioned. If the Poisson’s ratio is less than 0.5, the
volume increases when the line is tensioned. If it is assumed that ν ¼ 0:5 is a
reasonable value for the mooring line, it is observed that the axial elongation may
be computed using the effective tension and disregarding the Poisson effect:

For mooring lines, the effective tension concept does not change the forces signifi￾cantly. For larger-diameter structures, however, the effect is very important. E.g.,
deep-water pipelines may experience axial compression forces in the wall.
However, they will not buckle as the effective tension is positive.
7.6.2 Inelastic Catenary Line
The static equilibrium equations for mooring lines are derived under the
assumption of no bending stiffness in the line and small axial elongations.
In the following, the axial elongation is ignored. Consider a line suspended
between two points, A and B, as shown in Figure 7.15. The line has a length
L and it is assumed that the line is submerged in water. The vertical forces
acting are the weight and the buoyancy, w0 ¼ ð Þ w  ρgA . Here, w ¼ mg is the
weight in air per unit length of the line and m is the mass per unit length. ρ is the
density of water and A the cross-sectional area. No horizontal forces are acting
along the line; the horizontal component of the tension in the line H is thus constant
along the line. At each end of the line, vertical and horizontal point forces are
acting.
Consider a small section, Δs, of the line, as illustrated in Figure 7.16, and
consider equilibrium in the tangential and normal direction of the line:
ð Þ T þ peA w0 sinϕ  Δs þ ð Þ T þ peA þ ΔT cosð Þ¼ Δϕ 0:
w0 cosϕ  Δs þ ð Þ T þ peA þ ΔT sinð Þ¼ Δϕ 0: ½7:82
Here, the variation of the external pressure over the segment has been ignored.
Using T þ peA ¼ TE, cosð Þ Δϕ → 1 and sinð Þ Δϕ → Δϕ and letting the segment
length tend to zero, [7.82] is rewritten as:

upon the sea floor.
7.6.3 Elastic Catenary Line
For mooring line applications, the elastic elongation of the line may be of import￾ance, even if it is assumed to be small. A first-order approximation of the elastic
effects is thus acceptable. The stretched length of the segment in Figure 7.16 is
Δse ¼ ð Þ 1 þ ε Δs, with ε≪1. Assuming the Poisson’s ratio ν ¼ 0:5, the volume of
the segment will not change under the action of tension or external pressure. Thus,
the buoyancy force acting upon the tensioned segment is equal to that of the
unstretched segment, w1Δs1 ¼ w0Δs. The equations for the balance between hori￾zontal and vertical forces on a line segment are thus similar as for the inelastic line,
accounting for the new segment length:

7.6.4 Restoring Characteristics
As an example, the mooring line described in Figure 7.13 is used. Static force￾displacement characteristics in the plane of the catenary are considered. This
technique is valid for static loads and slow motions only. As the speed of the
motion increases, or the frequency of oscillation increases, viscous forces acting
upon the line become important and modify the restoring characteristics. This effect
is discussed in more detail below.
The line configurations for various horizontal tension levels are shown in
Figure 7.17. Note the large changes in touch-down position even for small
changes in position of the fair lead (top end). Changing the horizontal force
from 50 kN to 4500 kN moves the fair lead by 41.4 m. The corresponding
change in touch-down position is 425.1 m. The elastic elongation of the line is
only 0.51% at the largest tension level, i.e., the line length increases from
627.0 m to 630.2 m.
The force-displacement characteristic of a mooring line is in most cases
related to the change in geometry of the line, not the elastic elongation. As
seen from Figure 7.17, even small horizontal displacements at the top end of
the line cause large transverse motions of the line. This is a very important
effect in the case of dynamic excitation of the mooring line.
Figure 7.18 shows the restoring coefficients as a function of the horizontal force
level. The restoring coefficients are defined as Cxx ¼ ∂Fx=∂x, Cxz ¼ ∂Fx=∂z,
Czz ¼ ∂Fz=∂z. The stiffness is largest in the horizontal direction, Cxx, and increases
in this case almost linearly with the horizontal force. The vertical stiffness, Czz, is

while the circles show the anchor and fair lead positions. For the case with
H = 3020 kN, the touch-down is at 203.4 m. The horizontal distance from anchor
to fair lead is 621.1 m, and the length of the line between touch-down and fair lead
is 424.3 m (both lengths referred to in unstretched condition. For a horizontal
tension of 3020 kN, the line stretches by 0.34%).
258 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University Pressonly a small fraction of the horizontal stiffness. The coupling stiffness, Cxz ¼ Czx, is
also significantly less than the horizontal stiffness, but it is worth noting that a
horizontal displacement may cause a significant vertical force.
For further discussion it is useful to consider the mooring line stiffness composed
of two contributions in a series coupling. The two contributions are the geometric
stiffness effect and the elastic stiffness. The elastic stiffness, CE, is due to the
elasticity of the line, i.e., EA=L; the geometric stiffness, CG, is the stiffness due to
the force-displacement relations found from the inelastic catenary equations,
[7.84]. The total stiffness may be written as C ¼ ð Þ 1=CE þ 1=CG 1 .
For low tension levels, the geometrical change is relatively large even for a small
change in force, as illustrated in Figure 7.17. In this force range the geometric stiffness
thus dominates the total stiffness. As the tension level increases, the geometric changes
are reduced. This is in particular the case if the touch-down point has moved all the way
to the anchor. The geometry then approaches a straight line and the stiffness asymp￾totically approaches the elastic stiffness. This is illustrated in Figure 7.19.
7.6.5 Dynamic Effects
From the above discussion it is observed that a small displacement of the top
end of the line may cause large transverse displacements along the line. If the
top-end displacement takes place at a finite velocity, as in an oscillatory

line of length Δs, the local transverse and tangential drag force along the segment
may be written as:

These forces will oppose the change of line geometry. The top-end force will thus
be larger than in the static case. To solve this force-displacement relation in the
general case, including the above viscous drag forces as well as inertia effects, a
time-domain finite element approach is required. However, it is possible to estab￾lish some estimates to illustrate the effect of the viscous forces. For this purpose, it
is assumed that the line may be modeled as an elastic catenary with homogeneous
properties, and the elastic deformations are assumed to be much smaller than the
geometric deformations.
The line configuration, together with the notations used, are shown in
Figure 7.20. The motion of the line, relative to the initial static equilibrium
configuration, is denoted u sð Þ, with normal and tangential components un and
ut. It is assumed that the motion tangential to the top end is dominating the
deformation of the line, while top-end motion normal to the line is of minor
importance.
At the initial configuration, the line has a top tension T. By adding a top tension
ΔT, the elastic additional deformation of the top end, uET, is obtained by integrating
the strain along the full length of the line:

Here, the index T refers to the value at the top, s ¼ L. The geometric contribution to
the top-end tangential displacement is thus uGT ¼ uT  uET, where uT is the total
top-end displacement. The corresponding static displacements along the line are
denoted u0tð Þs and u0nð Þs . It is now assumed that the dynamic displacement along
the line is proportional to the static displacement, i.e., the geometric dynamic
displacement can be written as:
unð Þ¼ s αu0nð Þs :
utð Þ¼ s αu0tð Þs : ½7:91
If the top-end motion is assumed to be harmonic and the drag forces are linearized,
α becomes a complex coefficient relating the quasi-static geometric displacements
and the dynamic displacements. The velocities and accelerations along the line are
thus given by:

coefficient. No added mass is included in the tangential direction. There must be
a balance between the dynamic forces along the line, as expressed by [7.93], and the
end forces acting on the line. It is convenient to consider the moment of the forces
about the touch-down point. The moment of the distributed dynamic forces may be
written as:

As it is assumed that the dynamic displacement is following the quasi-static
mode shape, there will be proportionality between the strain at the upper
end and the elastic displacement along the line. Thus, the following

As both drag and inertia forces are acting on the line, there will be a phase
shift between maximum force and maximum displacement. An “apparent
stiffness” and damping force for the line may be derived. In very slow
262 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University Pressoscillations, α will be close to unity and the dynamic tension variation will be close
to the quasistatic value. As the drag forces on the line increase, either due to a higher
frequency of oscillation or due to a larger oscillation amplitude, α will decrease and
the dynamic tension will increase. This effect is called “drag-locking” as the drag
forces restrict the transverse motion of the line and force shifts the deformation
from a geometric to an elastic deformation. The apparent line stiffness thus
increases.
If the assumption of a quasi-static deformation pattern of the line is to be reason￾able, the frequency of oscillation should be significantly lower than the lowest natural
frequency of the line. A rough estimate of the natural frequencies for transverse
oscillation may be obtained by using the natural frequencies of an elastic horizontal
line with sag and fixed at both ends, as illustrated in Figure 7.21. The horizontal force
is T and the sag at the mid-span As. The sag is assumed to be much less than the length
of the line, causing the chord-length, c, to be approximately equal to the line length
and the horizontal force approximately equal to the line tension. Under these
assumptions, the two first natural frequencies are obtained as:

Here, A is the added mass per unit length for transverse oscillations. The first natural
frequency corresponds to a half-sine mode along the span. It therefore involves
axial deformations. The second natural frequency corresponds to a full sine mode
and does not involve axial deformations.

The two lowest transverse natural frequencies are estimated at 1.01 and 1.58 rad/s
respectively. Figure 7.22 shows the dynamic amplification of the top tension as a
function of oscillation frequency for two top-end tangential motion amplitudes, uTt ¼
0.1 m and 0.45 m. The results are compared to results from a nonlinear time-domain
finite element program (FEM) using the Morison equation for the hydrodynamic forces
(Ormberg and Bachynski, 2012).
Based upon the above estimates of the natural frequencies, one may expect the
results to be valid for frequencies well below 1 rad/s only. The importance of the drag
forces diminishes as the amplitude of oscillation is reduced. For the 0.1 m amplitude it
is observed that the dynamic load amplitude is lower than the quasi-static amplitude in
the low-frequency range. This is explained by the effect of the inertia loads, acting in
opposite phase to the restoring force.
For the largest amplitude, the drag forces are more important and a more rapid
increase in the dynamic tension is observed as the frequency increases. As the frequency
of oscillation increases, the difference between the present simplified approach and the
FEM results increases. An important reason for this is the assumption of a motion

FEM results is due to irregularities in the time-domain results causing difficulties in
identifying the relevant amplitudes of the dynamic loads.

7.7 Low-Frequency Wind-Induced Motions
As discussed in Chapter 2, several methods exist for generating the point
spectra of the wind velocity and the coherence of the wind field. Few
measurements are available to validate the various methods, in particular for
heights beyond 100 m above sea level and for the horizontal coherence.
Frequently, the models applied assume neutral stability of the atmosphere.
As discussed in Chapter 2, atmospheric conditions with almost neutral stabil￾ity are not the most common situation. The uncertainty about relevant spectral
models and coherence functions is significant in the low-frequency range.
Therefore, great care should be exercised in the choice of wind field model
when studying the dynamic response of floating wind turbines.
Floating Substructures 265
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressNybø, Nielsen and Godvik (2022) used various models to generate the wind field
and studied the low-frequency dynamic response of a 15 MW offshore wind turbine
on a spar floater. The rotor diameter is 240 m and the height of the rotor center is
135 m above sea level. The natural periods for the rigid-body motions (surge, sway,
heave, roll and pitch) for this kind of floaters may be in the range of 25–200 s. This
range of periods is normally not considered important for bottom-fixed wind
turbines. Depending upon the technique used to generate the wind field, large
differences in energy and coherence may appear in this low-frequency range.
This is particularly the case in non-neutral atmospheric stability conditions. For
the lowest frequencies it may be questioned whether the frequency content is part of
a stationary process or due to nonstationarity of the wind conditions. Independent of
the cause, the result may be excitation of low-frequency motion modes.
Nybø et al. (2022) used four different wind field formulations for the response
analyses: the standard Kaimal spectrum with an exponential coherence model; the
Mann spectral tensor model; a wind field generated by Large Eddy Simulation
(LES) code; and a model using a wind spectrum based upon measured wind speed
time series combined with a Davenport coherence model fitted to wind speed
measurements at two different vertical levels. This wind field is called TIMESR.
The LES wind field and the TIMESR both account for atmospheric stability in the
coherence, while the Kaimal and the Mann implementations assume neutral stabil￾ity. However, the turbulence intensity and mean wind shear are in these two models
fitted to measured data. Thereby, the mean wind speed, turbulence intensity and
wind shear are similar in all the applied models. In particular in the low-frequency
part, below 0.1 Hz of the spectra, significant difference in the energy content is
observed between the four methods. This is illustrated in Figure 7.23. It is observed
that the power spectra density (PSD) of the LES spectrum is significantly lower
than what is obtained by the other three methods. The coherence computed from the
wind fields also differs greatly. These differences are important for the excitation of
the various rigid modes of motion.
In Figure 7.24 illustrations of the importance of coherence to the excitation
loads are given. Case A illustrates large coherence in vertical direction over a
length scale similar to the rotor diameter, i.e., the dynamic wind speed is in phase
over this length scale. In the horizontal direction, the coherence is assumed to be
lower, causing opposite phase of the wind speed between the two sides of the rotor
disk. In Case B, the length scales of the vertical and horizontal coherences have
switched, i.e., large coherence in horizontal direction is assumed, while in the
vertical direction the wind speed has opposite phase in the lower versus the upper
part of the rotor. In Case C, the flow is assumed to be coherent over most of the
rotor disk, while in Case D, the turbulent structures are assumed to have very short
extent giving a very low coherence over the rotor disk area both in the vertical and
the horizontal direction.
266 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressAs indicated in the table in Figure 7.24, the three cases will excite the different
modes of motion differently. Case C will cause the largest excitation in surge, while
Cases A and B will cause lower loads as the total load on the rotor disk is partly
canceled out due to the phase differences. The same argument can be used for the
platform pitch motion, referred to the water line and the mooring loads. For the yaw
motion, however, it is observed that Case A will excite this mode more severely
than Cases B and C. Which case is most relevant is obviously dependent upon
frequency and rotor diameter considered. To which extent the atmospheric stability

ongoing research.
Figure 7.25 shows examples of the results obtained by Nybø et al. (2022). The
standard deviations of the surge, pitch and yaw motions in 7, 13 and 18 m/s mean
wind speed are given. Further, the damage equivalent load (DEM) for the most
heavily loaded mooring line is given. The DEM is an expression for the fatigue
loading in the line. The four wind spectra discussed above are used and neutral
atmospheric stability is assumed. The turbulence intensity is in the range of
2–6.6%. From the figure it is observed that there is a large scatter between the
results as obtained by the different methods for generating the wind fields. The
spectra obtained by TIMESR contain much energy at the lowest frequencies, which
is reflected in the platform surge and pitch motions and is also related to a high
coherence level over the rotor disk. On the other hand, it is observed that the Mann
model, causing low surge and pitch motions, results in the largest yaw motions.
This is closely related to the lower coherence obtained by using the Mann model.
Investigating various atmospheric stability conditions, additional differences
between the results are observed.
7.8 Control Issues for Floating Wind Turbines
7.8.1 Introduction
In discussing the control issues for bottom-fixed wind turbines (see Section 3.9), the
main control objectives were to maximize power production below rated wind
speed and to keep constant power above rated wind speed. It was also demonstrated
that the controller should be designed with a slow response relative to the eigenfre￾quencies of the structure. The controller thereby reacts properly to variations in the

exception is when the controller is tuned to provide damping to, for example, the
first fore-aft elastic bending mode of the tower.
For floaters, an additional perspective appears. Due to the rigid-body motions of
the floater, the rotor may have a significant motion perpendicular to the rotor plane.
The floater is also designed so that the rigid-body natural periods are outside the
range of wave periods. This implies natural periods above 20 s for slack (catenary)
moored floaters or below about 4 s for tension leg floaters. In this section the slack￾moored floater is considered. The pitch natural period may be in the range of 25–50
s, while the surge natural period may be more than 1 min. When the rotor is moving
toward the wind, the relative velocity between air and rotor increases. The control
system, as outlined in Section 3.9, will interpret this as an increased wind velocity
and as the period of motion period is so slow, the control system will adjust rotor
speed, torque and blade pitch accordingly. As will be discussed, the effect may be a
reduced or an increased damping of the floater motion. Other damping components
such as wave radiation damping and viscous damping are low for such low￾frequency motions. The floating wind turbine may thus require a modified control
system to ensure proper damping and motion behavior.
7.8.2 Action of a Conventional Controller
Consider the turbine outlined in Figure 7.26. The wind is supposed to blow in
positive x-direction and the surge and platform pitch motions are considered only.
The relative wind velocity at nacelle level can be written as:
Ur ¼ Uw  Unac ¼ Uw  η_1  znη_5: ½7:101
Here, Uw is the wind velocity at nacelle level and zn is the vertical position of the
nacelle. η1 and η5 are the surge and pitch motions respectively. It is assumed that
Uw > Unac . It is further assumed that the motions are so slow that the control system
adjusts the turbine to the stationary power and thrust. The thrust on the turbine is
thus given by:
T ¼ 1
2
CTρaAU2
r ; ½7:102
where A is the rotor area and CT is the thrust coefficient.
To illustrate the effect of the rigid-body motion, one frequency of motion is
considered only. This frequency may correspond to an eigenfrequency. As the
eigenmode does not need to correspond to the modes as defined by the coordinate
system, both a surge and pitch component need to be included. Each of the two
velocity components are thus written as:

Here, ϕi is the phase of each component. During one cycle of oscillation the
platform motion energy absorbed by the turbine may be written as:

Here Tη ¼ 2π=ω.
7.8.2.1 Below Rated Wind Speed
Below rated wind speed, the controller is tuned for maximum power production. In
this case both the power and thrust coefficients are almost constant. CT may thus be
assumed to be constant in estimating the absorbed energy during one cycle of
oscillation and [7.104] gives the following result:

due to the rotor thrust are found:
B11 ¼ CTρaAUw0:
B15 ¼ B51 ¼ CTρaAUw0zn
B55 ¼ CTρaAUw0z2
n:
½7:107
CT is in the order of 0.8–0.9 for wind velocities below rated. It is thus observed that
the wind turbine contributes with a positive and, as can be shown, very significant
damping when operating below rated wind speed and a conventional control system
for bottom-fixed turbines is used. This is valid both for pitch and surge motions.
7.8.2.2 Above Rated Wind Speed
Above rated wind speed, the conventional blade pitch controller is set to maintain
constant power and rotational speed. Thus, the thrust coefficient varies with the
mean wind velocity, as demonstrated in Section 3.8. For the slow platform motions
considered here, it may be assumed that the blade pitch controller and the thrust
force behave almost as in the stationary case, i.e., there is no time delay between the
change in relative velocity and corresponding thrust.
As a first approximation it is assumed that the thrust coefficient varies linearly
with the relative wind velocity. This is an acceptable assumption for small velocity
variations around the mean velocity Uw0. Thus, the thrust coefficient is written as:
CTð Þ¼ Ur CTð Þ Uw0 1 þ kCT

 : ½7:108
Here, Ud ¼ Unac ¼ η_1  zaη_5 is the dynamic variation in the relative wind
velocity due to the combined surge and pitch motion. It is assumed that
Ud≪Uw0. Under the above assumptions, the instantaneous thrust force becomes:

Above rated wind speed, the slope of the thrust coefficient versus wind

been illustrated both in numerical simulations and in full scale. Skaare et al.

also shown in simulations (see Figure 7.28).

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University Press7.8.3 Control of Low-Frequency Motions
7.8.3.1 Controller for Bottom-Fixed Turbines
Larsen and Hanson (2007) demonstrated by simulation the build-up of excessive
motion of a floating wind turbine if a conventional controller2 was used above rated
wind speed. They demonstrated how a bottom-fixed wind turbine with tower
natural frequency of 0.5 Hz and a controller natural frequency of 0.1 Hz had a
nice and stable response, while unstable behavior occurred after shifting the tower
natural frequency to 0.05 Hz. Above rated wind speed they used a PI controller with
constant torque and blade pitch control for rotor speed. The reason for using
constant torque rather than constant power is to reduce dynamic loads in the
drive train. The penalty is somewhat larger variations in output power.
To investigate further if the principles for the bottom-fixed turbine controller could
be used for a floating wind turbine and obtain stable response, Larsen and Hanson
(2007) kept the PI controller and tested out four natural frequencies for the controller.
The frequencies were 0.02, 0.04, 0.05 and 0.1 Hz. For each natural frequency they
tuned the controller gains and studied the wind turbine behavior. The natural fre￾quency of the turbine pitch motion was 0.035 Hz. From previous experience they
aimed for a relative damping ratio of 0.8. They found that a controller natural
frequency of 0.02 Hz was superior to the other choices, confirming the observations
in Chapter 3 that the controller natural frequency should be significantly below the
structural natural frequencies to avoid destructive interaction.
The controller proposed by Larsen and Hanson (2007) removed the unstable
behavior and reduced the platform pitch motion significantly. However, simulations
in turbulent wind revealed large dynamic variations in quantities including power,
torque and rotational speed. Increased variations in these quantities must be expected
as the controller is too slow to adjust for the variation in the incident wind speed.
Additional variations are to be expected when wave-induced motions are included.
The following section briefly discusses a couple of other options to avoid
excitation of the modes with low natural frequencies, e.g., surge and pitch.
7.8.3.2 Use of a Notch Filter
A notch filter is a filter that is used to remove components of certain frequencies in a
stochastic signal. A classic example is removing noise due to the 50 Hz grid
frequency in electrical appliances. In the present case a notch filter is used to
remove the input to the blade pitch control signal in a narrow frequency range. If
this narrow frequency range is centered on the platform pitch natural frequency, the
hypothesis is that the resonant excitation is avoided. Some basics about the notch
filter and how it can be implemented in time domain are given in Appendix D.
2 See Section 3.9 for a discussion of conventional controllers.
274 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressAs shown in this appendix, a notch filter can be applied to a discrete stochastic time

yn ¼ X
M
k¼0
ckxnk þX
N
j¼1
djynj: ½7:113
The coefficients ck and dj are obtained from the filter frequency, bandwidth and
sampling interval.
The notch filter can be used in simulation models where the conventional
controller is represented by, for example, a look-up table for the turbine thrust.
The notch filter may then be used to simulate the floater motion controller. Used
together with a conventional controller, problems may occur due to, e.g., the phase
shift introduced by the notch filter. Assuming a linear relation between small
variations in blade pitch angle and variation in thrust force, the effect of the notch
filter will be illustrated by filtering the relative wind velocity between the wind and
the turbine, governing the thrust force.

The power and thrust coefficients for the turbine considered are shown in
Figure 7.29. The coupled surge and pitch platform rigid-body motions are con￾sidered. A small linear damping (approximately 2%) is included in the model to
account for an approximate hydrodynamic damping and to ensure stability of the
numerical integration. The natural periods for the coupled surge-pitch system are
obtained as 115.7 s and 29.8 s respectively. The longest natural period corres￾ponds to an almost pure horizontal translation, while the fastest natural period
corresponds to a rotational mode with center of rotation 69.1 m below the free
surface, i.e., about midway between the center of buoyancy and the center of
gravity.
The wind turbine is exposed to a wind field with mean wind speed 15 m/s at nacelle
level and a turbulence intensity of 10%. The wind field is assumed to be coherent over
the rotor disk area. A forward Euler integration scheme with time step 0.1 s is used for
the simulations.

Figure 7.30 Simulated platform motions. Mean wind speed 15 m/s, TI = 10%. Thin
line: thrust force directly from static characteristic and relative wind speed; thick
line: applying notch filter to relative wind speed.
Two cases are considered in the simulations. First, a simulation is performed
using the relative wind speed as input to the thrust force calculations and
applying the quasi-static thrust characteristic to obtain the turbine thrust. The
second simulation is performed in a similar way, the only difference being the
relative wind speed, which now is passed through the notch filter prior to the
thrust force calculation. The notch filter has a center frequency of 1/29.8 s,
corresponding to the platform pitch natural frequency, and a bandwidth
ε ¼ 0:1. The computed surge and pitch motions for the two cases are displayed in
Figure 7.30.
From Figure 7.30 it is observed that initially the motions are dominated by
the transient effects. This is to be expected as the initial position of the platform
is at origin with zero platform pitch angle and the wind force is set on at full
strength at t = 0. After a while the transient effects dies out. In the case without
a notch filter, a large resonant pitch motion builds up. We have here an example
of where the eigenmodes differ from the defined modes of motion. In the
Floating Substructures 277

analysis, the pitch is defined as rotation about the y-axis, located at the water
plane. However, the eigenmode for rotation has a center of rotation far below
the water plane. Thus, the rotational eigenmode (“pitch mode”) also dominates
the surge motion. The pitch motion is limited by the system damping and
because excitation of the natural frequency is avoided by the use of the notch
filter. Further, the relative wind speed drops below the rated wind speed during
some of the oscillations. Below rated wind speed, the aerodynamic loads con￾tribute to damping.
Applying the notch filter, the platform pitch motion dies out after the transient and
has only small amplitude motions caused by the turbulent wind force. The surge motion
shows some long periodic resonant motions. These is because the wind forcing at the
surge natural period is not filtered out.
7.8.3.3 Motion Control Strategies
Section 3.9.3 discussed the control of a bottom-fixed wind turbine operation above
rated wind speed. A PI control of the blade pitch angle was used:
Δβ ¼ KpΔωg þ Ki
ðt
0
Δωgdt; ½7:114
where Kp and Ki are the proportional and integral gain respectively. If one
considers a SDOF system, for example, the pure pitch motion of a floating
wind turbine, it is possible to introduce a correction for the nacelle motion to
avoid the negative damping discussed above. One may add a term propor￾tional to the nacelle velocity on the right-hand side of [7.114], Kfbη_n. This is a
feedback term. De Souza (2022) investigated this approach for a spar platform with
a 20 MW wind turbine combined with a rotor torque control. De Souza found that
the approach may have stability issues, in particular when introducing a low-pass
filter on the input to the controller. The filter introduces a phase shift which reduces
the stability.
To improve the stability of the above feedback control, a term proportional to the
nacelle offset may be introduced. Then [7.114] is modified to:
Δβ ¼ KpΔωg þ Ki
ðt
0
Δωgdt  KpKff η_n  KiKff ηn: ½7:115
278 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressHere, Kff is a feed-forward gain, less than zero. De Souza (2022) showed that this
approached improved the stability even with a filter present.
Skaare et al. (2007) used an estimator-based control strategy consisting of
a numerical model of the wind turbine together with measurements to
estimate the incoming wind. The measurements can be nacelle acceleration,
thrust force rotor torque and/or power. Skaare et al. (2007) implemented the
estimator-based control system using a tool for computing the dynamics of
floating wind turbines and found significant improved fatigue life of the
tower due to the reduced pitch motion. A minor reduction in the mean
power output was observed as well as some increased variability of power
and rotational speed.
7.8.3.4 Use of Energy Shaping Control
Pedersen (2017) demonstrates how the negative damping can be mitigated
by varying the rotor speed and thus using the rotor as an intermediate energy
storage. He calls the principle “energy shaping control” (ESC). In the follow￾ing, the main principle of the approach is outlined and demonstrated.
As above, the horizontal velocity of the floater at nacelle level is considered.
Considering the combined surge and pitch motion, the velocity at nacelle level
becomes η_n ¼ η_1 þ znη_5.
It is assumed that the power output from the rotor follows the relative velocity
between the wind and the rotor in a quasi-static manner, i.e., the delivered power
from the rotor may be approximated by:
P ¼ T Uw0  η_n ð Þ: ½7:116
It is assumed that jη_nj << Uw0. At above-rated wind speeds, the conventional
controller aims at keeping the power as well as the rotor speed constant. The
thrust, and thus the power, is thus controlled by pitching the blades.
Now assume that the rotational speed of the rotor may vary. Ignoring losses, the
equilibrium in instantaneous power may then be written as:
d
dt
1
2
IΩ2

  þ P ¼ T Uw0  η_n ð Þ: ½7:117
The first term in [7.117] is the power used for changing the kinetic energy in the
rotor-generator assembly. Consider the variation around an equilibrium condition.
At equilibrium Ω ¼ Ω0, P ¼ P0 and T ¼ T0. I.e., for a small deviation from the
equilibrium condition, [7.117] may be written as:
Floating Substructures 279
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressIð Þ Ω0 þ ΔΩ Ω_ 0 þ ΔΩ_  	 þ Pð Þþ Ω0 ΔP ¼ ð Þ T0 þ ΔT Uw0  η_n ð Þ: ½7:118
Now Ω_ 0 ¼ 0 and Pð Þ¼ Ω0 T0Uw0. For small deviations from equilibrium, we thus
obtain:
ΔP ¼ dPð Þ Ω0
dΩ
ΔΩ
ΔT ¼ dT Uð Þ w0
dU ΔUrel ¼  dT Uð Þ w0
dU η_n;
½7:119
Omitting terms of higher order, and using [7.117], the following linear equation for
the variation of the rotational speed is obtained:
IΩ0ΔΩ_ þ
dPð Þ Ω0
dΩ
ΔΩ ¼ ΔTUw0  T0η_n: ½7:120
Again, we observe that if the rotor velocity is constant, ΔΩ ¼ ΔΩ_ ¼ 0, the follow￾ing relation is obtained:
ΔT
T0
¼ η_n
Uw0
: ½7:121
That is, if the axial velocity of the rotor increases (in the direction of the
incident wind) the thrust force also increases, and a negative damping effect is
obtained.
To avoid this negative damping effect, Pedersen (2017) proposes allowing
for variation in the rotational speed. The variation of the rotational speed is
controlled by an augmented reference signal for the rotor speed controller.
Pedersen thus assumes that the actual rotational speed Ω is observed with
high accuracy and that the set-point for the controller is augmented by a
correction term ΔΩ such that the controller aims for a rotational speed of
Ωr ≃ Ω ¼ Ω0 þ ΔΩ. The new rotational velocity is obtained by solving a differ￾ential equation with left-hand side equal to [7.120] but with a new right-hand side:
IΩ0ΔΩ_ þ
dPð Þ Ω0
dΩ
ΔΩ ¼ αT0η_n: ½7:122
By requiring that the right-hand sides of [7.120] and [7.122] are equal, the
following is obtained:

: ½7:123
It is observed that for α > 1, the variation in thrust force will act in the opposite
direction of η_n, i.e., a positive damping is obtained. The thrust force on the turbine
may now be written as:
T tðÞ¼ 1

2
ρπR2
½Ctð Þ Uw U2
wðtÞ þ ð Þ 1  α Ctð Þ Uw0 η_nUw0:
½7:124
Here, Uwð Þt is the instantaneous incident wind velocity.
Now, jη_nj=Uw0≪1, CtðUwÞ=CtðUw0Þ is close to unity and α is of order 1 but
larger than 1. Thus, it is clear from [7.124] that the damping force is positive but
small compared to the average wind thrust.
Use of Energy Shaping Control
The same 5 MW turbine as in the previous example is considered. The rotational inertia
of the rotor-generator assembly is set to I ¼ 5:026E06kgm2. The power is given by
P ¼ QΩ, Q being the rotor torque. The derivative of the power with respect to the rotor
velocity is obtained as:
dPð Þ Ω0
dΩ ¼ Q0 þ Ω0
dQ
dΩ : ½7:125
For simplicity, it is assumed that the second term may be ignored. In lack of a proper
controller, a perfect control of the rotational speed is assumed. I.e., the rotational speed
obeys [7.122], where the nacelle velocity is obtained by solving for the combined
platform pitch and surge motions. The instantaneous wind thrust is then obtained from
[7.124]. Simulations with and without ESC are performed. In the ESC case the
augmentation factor α is set to 2.
First, a steady case with steady wind speed of 15 m/s is considered. The wind
is started instantaneously at t = 0. In Figure 7.31 the computed surge and pitch
responses are shown and compared for the two cases. A significant transient
response is observed in both cases. In the initial phase the responses are similar
for the case with and without ESC, but after a while the ESC case responses are
attenuated and decay toward the steady-state value, about 15 m for surge and 3
deg for pitch. The case without ESC continues with large oscillations dominated
by the pitch natural period. Figure 7.32 shows the corresponding variations in
rotor thrust and rotational velocity.

Second, the same case as above is considered but including 10% turbulence inten￾sity. A Kaimal wind spectrum is applied with coherence of 1 over the rotor area. The
computed motions are shown in Figure 7.33. Large, almost steady-state pitch motions
are obtained without the ESC, while in the ESC case the motions are reduced signifi￾cantly after the end of the initial transient motions.

7.8.3.5 Examples from the Hywind Demo Development
In the development of the Hywind demo project, several new controllers were
developed (see, e.g., Nielsen, Hanson and Skaare, 2006; Skaare et al., 2011;
Skaare, Hanson and Nielsen, 2007; and Skaare et al., 2014). The detailed
specifications of the controllers are proprietary, but results from the imple￾mentation of two of them are given in Skaare et al. (2011). The key idea is
that the standard controller should work as before, keeping constant power
production above rated wind speed and collectively adjusting the blade pitch
angle to compensate for the variation in wind speed. The additional new
motion controller “sits on top” of the standard controller, using the turbine
motions as an extra input. By using the information of the turbine pitch
motion an extra blade pitch signal can be given to provide the damping
Floating Substructures 283
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University Pressrequired to avoid excessive resonant motion, like what is demonstrated by the
ESC in Section 7.8.3.4.
Similarly, as the blade pitch angle can be used to provide damping of the turbine
pitch motion, one may use variation in generator torque to provide damping of the
roll motion. In designing the controllers and determining the gains, one must
evaluate issues such as: How much damping is needed? How do the motions
influence fatigue of the structure? Does the controller impose excessive blade
pitch activity and thus reduced lifetime of the actuators? Does the controller interact
with nonresonant motions that are difficult to control, for example, wave-induced
motions?
By a proper setting of the controller, energy from the wave-induced motions may
be extracted by the wind turbine. This may have some relevance at below-rated
wind speeds. The basic principles are given in Nielsen, Hanson and Skaare (2006).
The key challenge is that large motions will be required to extract a significant
amount of energy.
7.8.4 Some Possible Dynamic Instabilities
7.8.4.1 Heave-Pitch (Roll) Coupling
Section 8.4 discusses the Mathieu instability in the context of a lifting operation
from a moving crane. The vertical motion of the crane tip causes a variation in the
tension in the lifting line. The line tension is entering into the restoring force for the
pendulum motion of the load, and thus the equation of motion of the pendulum
motion has a time-varying stiffness. The differential equation for the pendulum
motion is an example of the Mathieu equation, which, in a more general form, may
be written as:
η€ þ 2ζω0η_ þ ω2
0½1 þ εcosð Þ ωt η ¼ 0: ½7:126
Here, it has been assumed that the time variation in the stiffness term is harmonic.
ω0 is the undamped natural frequency and ζ is the damping ratio. It can be shown
that the time-varying stiffness term may cause instability of the system. Even
without any external excitation, η may increase from an initial small value. For
small ε, the instability occurs for ω=ω0 ¼ 2=n; n ¼ 1; 2; 3; ... . For larger ε, the
range of instability increases, while increased damping reduces the range of
instability (see Figure 8.8).
For a floating platform, pitch or roll motions may be excited by large heave
motions. Consider the pitch motion of a spar substructure. The pitch-restoring term
is given in [7.69] as:
284 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressC55 ¼ ρg Sð Þ 11 þ VzB MgzG: ½7:127
Within linear theory, C55 is a constant.4 However, if the floating turbine performs
large heave motions, and the pitch restoring is evaluated at the actual vertical
position of the substructure, it is observed that both the displaced volume V and
the centers of buoyancy and gravity will vary with the heave motion (Haslum and
Faltinsen, 1999). If the substructure has a heave motion η3ð Þt , the change in
submerged volume becomes Sη3, with S being the water plane area of the
substructure. The center of buoyancy will move 1
2 η3 upward. Thus, the pitch￾restoring term in the heave-displaced position is obtained as:
Ce55 ¼ ρg V  Sη3 ð Þ zB þ
1
2
η3  zG  η3
 : ½7:128
For a spar substructure, the water plane area in most cases will contribute little to
the pitch restoring. Thus, by accounting for the heave motion, the pitch restoring
can be approximated by:
Ce55 ≃ C55 1  1
2
η3
ð Þ zB  zG
 : ½7:129
If η3ð Þt is harmonic and η in [7.126] is replaced with η5, the time-varying pitch￾restoring term is obtained as:
ε cosð Þ¼ ωt
1
2
η3A
ð Þ zB  zG
cosð Þ ωt : ½7:130
Considering the regions of instability, large pitch (or roll) motions may occur if the
ratio between the period of the heave motion T and the pitch natural period T0 is 1/2,
1, ... . From Figure 8.8, it is observed that the range of instability is large in
particular in the region around T=T0 ¼ 1=2. Large heave motions may occur if the
heave natural period is in the range of the wave periods. Therefore, a normal design
requirement is for the heave natural period to be larger than the wave periods and
the pitch natural period to be more than twice the wave periods.
For a lightly damped substructure, resonant heave motions may also be excited
by second-order wave loads and other nonlinear effects. Haslum and Faltinsen
(1999) demonstrate how a heave motion consisting of one component at a wave
frequency and a slower component at the heave resonant period may contribute to
4 For floating bodies such as ships, we have ρV ¼ m. C55 is then frequently written as ρgV GM0, where GM0 is the
initial metacentric height. For floating bodies with large waterplane area, S11 is the dominating term, while for
spars the term V zð Þ B  zG dominates GM0.
Floating Substructures 285
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.009 Published online by Cambridge University PressMathieu instability. The two motion components will create a heave envelope
process with frequency Δω ¼ ωwave  ω03. Thus, if the pitch natural frequency
coincides with Δω, large pitch motions may occur via the Mathieu instability. The
nonlinear effect causing heave at the heave natural period is a coupling effect
between the heave and pitch motion. When the spar substructure performs a pitch
motion, forces acting perpendicular to the axis of the spar cause a vertical force. The
heave motion at resonance is thereby amplified, which, via the Mathieu instability,
again amplifies the pitch motion. Increased heave and pitch damping will mitigate
the resonant responses.
7.8.4.2 Roll-Yaw Coupling
Haslum et al. (2022) point out an aerodynamic coupling effect that may cause large
roll and yaw motions of a floating wind turbine. They illustrate the effect by
considering a spar platform. The effect may be explained as follows. Consider a
spar substructure, as illustrated in Figure 7.1. However, to minimize the coupling
effects in the inertia matrix, the origin of the coordinate system is moved downward
to the CG of the floating turbine. For simplicity only the roll and yaw motions are
considered. Under the assumption that the thrust T on the rotor acts perpendicular to
the rotor plane, the thrust in x and y-direction becomes Tx ¼ T cosη6 and
Ty ¼ T sinη6. The thrust acts a distance h above origin, thus the roll and yaw
moments due to the thrust may be written as:
F4 ¼ Tyh cos η4 ≃  Thη6 ¼ C46η6:
F6 ¼ Txh sin η4 ≃ Thη4 ¼ C64η4
½7:131
Here, small rotations have been assumed and the aerodynamic stiffness coupling
terms C46 ¼ C64 introduced. Assuming a diagonal mass matrix and that the
linearized hydrostatic and mooring stiffnesses are also diagonal, the inertia and
stiffness matrices for the coupled roll-yaw motion may be written as:
M ¼ m44 0

still is positive, two real natural frequencies are still obtained. If the coupling term
increases so that the term inside the square root becomes negative, the natural
frequencies become complex, i.e., λi ¼ αi ± iβi
. Thus, the undamped response will
behave as:
ηi
ðÞ¼ t Aeiλit ¼ Aeiαit
e±βit
: ½7:134
The first term represents a harmonic oscillation while the second
term represents an exponential decaying term and an exponential growing
term. Thus, to avoid instability in the undamped case, the term under the
square root sign in [7.133] must be positive. This can be expressed as a
requirement to the frequency difference between the uncoupled roll and yaw
frequencies:

m44m66 p : ½7:135
As C46 ¼ Th, the requirement to the difference between the roll and yaw natural
frequencies increases as the thrust force increases and as the distance between the
CG and the nacelle increases.
The above considerations illustrate the main causes of the instability of the
coupled roll-yaw motion. Haslum et al. (2022) have studied the phenomenon
using a state-of-the-art computer program for floating wind turbines. Due to
several coupling effects, nonlinearities and damping, an exponential increase
of the motions is not observed, but rather limit-cycle motion responses. An
important observation is that damping may reduce the limiting thrust force for
stability as given by [7.135]. This is explained by the fact that a phase shift
between the two motions will cause the thrust force to partly act in phase with
the motion velocity. Damping causes such a phase shift. A force acting in
phase with the motion velocity will transfer or extract energy into that mode
of motion.

Offshore Wind Farms
Offshore wind farms consist of many wind turbines connected to a common power
system. The earliest offshore wind farm, Vindeby, was installed in 1991 and decommis￾sioned in 2017. It was installed in shallow waters, at a depth of about 4 m, in Danish
waters only 2 km from shore. The wind farm consisted of eleven 0.45MWturbines. This
contrasts with recent projects such as those at Dogger Bank. The Dogger Bank Offshore
Development Zone is located in the North Sea in UK waters at a distance between
125 km and 290 km east of England. The water depths in this area are in the range of 18
to more than 60 m. Three wind farms are under development: Dogger Bank A, B and
C. Each of the projects is planned for an installed power of 1200 MW, covering areas in
the range of 515–599 km2
. The wind farms are to be developed in the shallowest area of
the Dogger Bank Offshore Development Zone, with water depths ranging from approxi￾mately 20 to 35 m. It may be expected that the wind farms will be developed using state￾of-the-art offshore wind turbines with rated power in the range 12 to 15MW. This means
that in the order of 100 turbines are needed in each of the wind farms.
For bottom-fixed offshore wind farms, the turbines represent about 35% of the
capital cost (CAPEX), while substructures represent about 13%, electrical infra￾structure 18% and assembly and installation about 10% (Global Wind Energy
Council, 2022). Monopiles are the most frequently used substructure. Floating
wind farms are still in their infancy, the largest being the Hywind Tampen wind
farm off the west coast of Norway, consisting of 11 turbines each of 8.6 MW
capacity on a spar substructure.
In the design of wind farms, several partly conflicting interests must be handled. The
license conditions for a specific concession area may contain conditions related to
the maximum and minimum installed capacity as well as conditions related to turbine
size and interaction with other activities in the area, for example, fishery, military
334
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.010 Published online by Cambridge University Pressactivity and shipping lanes. Further, conditions related to protection of the environ￾ment, avoidance of bird collisions etc. may be imposed. In particular, noise related to
piling may be a problem to the marine life and noise-reducing measures may be
required. As part of the planning process, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is
normally required. The requirements vary from country to country. Ideally the EIA
should involve environmental mapping and measurements for a period prior to the
development as well as follow-on registrations during the construction and operational
phases to confirm the assessments in the EIA.
The cost of electricity delivered from an offshore wind farm depends both on the
investment costs, CAPEX and operational costs (OPEX), as well as the amount of
energy produced, which depends on the interaction between the wind turbines and
thus the layout of the wind farm. Until recently, the cost of electricity from offshore
wind farms was too high to be attractive from a pure market perspective. Various
support schemes have thus been introduced to stimulate the development of energy
from offshore wind. Such schemes have varied between countries and over time. One
group of support schemes is related to investment support, either in the form of
investment grants or discount on loans etc. Another main group is support during the
operational phase. Feed-in tariffs have been used to guarantee the operator of a wind
farm a long-term price on the energy delivered. Another system is the premium
principle, where the operator sells the energy in the market but receives a price
supplement on top. To stimulate cost reduction in the industry, many countries use
a premium-based support scheme where the licenses are awarded via an auction
system. Details about and an evaluation of the various support schemes are provided
by the European Commission Directorate-General for Energy (2022).
9.1 Cost of Electricity
A concession for developing a wind farm is limited to a certain development area.
Within the terms given in the license, the developer normally will aim for
a maximum revenue of the invested capital. In simple terms, this may be thought
of as minimizing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), which is frequently used as
a measure for comparing various energy projects. In its simplest form, the LCOE
may be expressed as:
LCOE ¼ Investments þ Operational costs
Energy delivered ¼
I0 þX
N
k¼1
Ak
1 þ i ð Þr k

Offshore Wind Farms 335
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.010 Published online by Cambridge University PressHere, I0 denotes the initial investments in the wind farm or power station, assumed
to take place in year zero; N is the expected operational lifetime in years of the wind
farm; k is the year of operation; Ak is the operational costs in year k, including, e.g.,
fuel costs if a fuel-based power plant is considered; Mk is the energy delivered
in year k; ir is the discount rate to be used in present value calculations. As can be
seen from [9.1], the LCOE is a cost per energy unit computed as a present cost
in year zero. It is thus well suited for comparison of the economy of various
projects. The above simplistic electricity cost estimate does not account for factors
such as taxes, difference in discount rate using equity versus bank loan, inflation
etc. ir is frequently denoted as “weighted average cost of capital” (WACC). From
[9.1] it is observed that the initial investments have a large weight on LCOE, and the
operational costs during the first years are also important cost drivers, but the
importance diminishes as time increases. The same is valid for power production,
but with the opposite effect; a high energy production during the first years of
operation contributes to a reduced LCOE. The discount rate is important to the
LCOE. A low discount rate favors projects with high initial investments and long
expected lifetimes.
When comparing published data for LCOE one should be aware which invest￾ments are included, for example, costs of power transmission to shore and grid
connections. Such costs may represent a significant cost element. For some projects
the cost of power transmission is part of the operational cost, not the investment.
Also, the decommissioning (removal) of the wind farm at end of operation should
be included in calculating the LCOE.
Renewable energy systems such as wind and solar involve high investment costs
and relatively low operational costs. This is in contrast to fossil fuel-based electricity
generation such as gas power plants. For a gas power plant, the yearly operational
costs, including gas costs, are the major contribution to LCOE. Thus, in the LCOE
calculation the discount rate and the estimated lifetime is of less importance to a gas
power plant than it is to a renewable energy system. A low discount rate generally
favors renewable energy systems.
9.2 Wind Farm Layout
An offshore wind farm consists of four main components: wind turbines, inter￾array cables, a substation and an export cable. An illustration of a possible layout of
an offshore wind farm is shown in Figure 9.1. The solid lines illustrate a radial
layout of the inter-array cables. Adding the cables, shown as dashed lines, a ring
layout is obtained. Using a radial layout, a failure in one cable may cause loss of
power from several turbines. The ring layout is less vulnerable.
336 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.010 Published online by Cambridge University PressEach wind turbine delivers power into the inter-array cables, which are con￾nected to the substation, where the voltage is transformed to a higher level.
Depending upon the distance to shore and the power capacity of the wind farm,
the current may be transformed from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC)
at the substation. This is done to reduce inductive losses in the export cable to shore.
Typical voltages in the inter-array cable are in the range of 30–36 kV and in the
export cable in the range of 110–220 kV. For newer and larger wind farms, even
higher voltages may be preferred.
To compute a preliminary estimate of the yearly energy produced by each
turbine, the yearly distribution of wind speeds together with the turbine’s power
curve are used. An example of a yearly distribution of the wind speed is shown in
Figure 9.3, together with a power curve. The observed wind statistics are fitted to
a two-parameter Weibull distribution. Using the wind data and the power curve
shown in Figure 9.3, a distribution of the power production over the year is
obtained. The cumulative distribution is shown. It is observed that for about 18%
of the year, there is no production, mainly due to wind speeds being below cut￾in. In addition downtime due to failures and maintenance must be accounted for.
For the case shown in Figure 9.3, the turbine runs at rated power approximately
17% of the time. Most of the time the turbine runs at partial load. This implies that
in a wind farm setting, for most of the time the power delivered from the turbine is
very sensitive to changes in the wind speed due to, for example, wake effects.
At sites with comparatively high mean wind speeds, the rotor diameter may be
reduced relative to sites with lower average wind speeds and keeping the same capacity
factor. This may reduce investment costs. However, the present trend has been to keep
a large rotor diameter and take advantage of the higher yearly energy yield.

lines plus dashed lines) inter-array cable configuration. Circles indicate turbine loca￾tions, the triangle indicates the substation and the thick line is the export cable.
Offshore Wind Farms 337
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.010 Published online by Cambridge University PressThe placement of the turbines within the concession area is an optimization
challenge. An important factor for optimization is the distribution of wind direc￾tions. Examples of the directional distribution of the mean wind speed are shown in
Figure 9.2. This way of presenting the directional distribution of the mean wind
speed is called a wind rose. The wind rose shows the frequency of occurrence of
various wind speed ranges as a function of wind direction. In the example shown in
Figure 9.2, directional intervals of 10 deg are used. Within each directional interval
the frequency of occurrence of wind speeds in 2 m/s intervals are shown. The
example in Figure 9.2 (left) is from a site not far from the west coast of Norway. The
coastline runs roughly from south to north. It is observed that the prevailing wind
directions follow the coastline. For the site further offshore a greater variation in
wind directions is observed, with prevailing winds in the directions from south￾west to north-west. The difference in the directional distribution of the mean wind
speed for the two sites has implications on the optimum layout of the wind farms for
the two sites. To avoid wind turbines operating in the wake of upstream turbines one
should avoid placement of turbines along lines in the prevailing wind direction. If
a wind turbine does operate in the wake of an upstream wind turbine, reduced
power production will frequently occur for the downstream turbine, in particular for
wind velocities below rated wind speeds. Also, an increased turbulence level is
experienced in the wake, causing increased fatigue loads. Turbine wakes are
discussed in more detail in Section 9.3, but for the present considerations the
wake may be thought of as a conically shaped area behind a wind turbine within

150 m above sea level. The results are based upon hourly data over a period of 27
years. The wind directions are given as “coming from,” e.g., “West” is wind

338 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.010 Published online by Cambridge University Presswhich the wind velocity is reduced due to the momentum loss at the turbine and the
turbulence level is increased due to the large velocity shear. The wake broadens and
the velocity deficit is reduced as the distance from the turbine increases, as illus￾trated in Figure 9.4.
For floating wind turbines, with very low natural frequencies in surge and sway,
operation partially in a wake or in a meandering wake may cause unwanted and
severe low-frequency motions with corresponding large dynamic loads in the
mooring system.
As discussed in Section 9.3, the recovery of the wind speed in the wake region
depends upon several parameters such as the turbulence level in the incident wind
field and the stability of the atmospheric boundary layer. As the turbulence level in
general is lower offshore than onshore, the wake effect persists for a longer distance

longer offshore than onshore. A distance between the turbines in the range of six to
more than ten rotor diameters is used. Longer distances reduce the wake effects but
increase inter-array cable costs and limit the total installed power within a certain
area.
Other issues that must be considered in the planning of the wind farm layout
include the following.
- Water depth. Costs, e.g., for monopiles and jacket substructures, increase consid￾erably as the water depth increases. An illustration of the costs as a function of
water depth is given in Figure 4.9.
- Bottom sediment characteristics. The choice of foundation and length of mono￾piles or piles depends upon the sediment characteristics. If the characteristics vary
considerably over the farm area, each turbine foundation may need to be designed
individually.
- For floating wind turbines with catenary mooring, common anchor points for
several mooring lines may be considered. This will reduce the cost of anchors but
restrict possible turbine positions.
- Neighbor wind farms. In areas where several wind farms are planned within
a close proximity, such as the southern North Sea, the wake behind one
wind farm may cause reduced inflow wind speeds for a downstream wind
farm (see Section 9.3.2).

340 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.010 Published online by Cambridge University Press- Environmental issues related to marine life and birds must have attendance in the
planning phase and may impact the layout of the wind farm.
- Ship traffic, fishing activities and military considerations may restrict the layout
of the wind farm.
- As offshore wind farms occupy huge areas, combined use of the areas should be
considered. This may involve fish farming or seaweed farming, wave energy or
solar power. Such activities may use common infrastructure and coordinate
operational activities and thus reduce costs.
Area Needs for Offshore Wind Farms
Assume an offshore wind farm of Ptot ¼ 1200 MW in a quadratic layout with equal
distance between the turbines in both directions. The distance between the turbines is
denoted αD and D is the rotor diameter. The rated power of each turbine is Pr and the
capacity factor Cc. The number of turbines needed is N ¼ Ptot=Pr and the yearly
electric energy production E ¼ 8760 PtotCc½MWh. The length of each side of the wind
farm becomes L ¼ αD ffiffiffiffi

in the approximate expression for the farm area, one obtains A ≃ 8

r
. Thus, the
area needed is approximately independent of the size of the turbines (rotor
diameter) but sensitive to the rated wind speed and the power coefficient at rated
power.
Using some characteristic values (see Table 3.3): Pr ¼ 10 MW, D ¼ 178:3 m,
Ur ¼ 11:4 m=s, CPr ¼ 0:4414 and, choosing α ¼ 8, the area needed for the 1200 MW
wind farm is obtained as 244 km2. This in less than half the area given for the Dogger
Bank projects (515–599 km2
). The difference may be explained by several factors: non￾quadratic layout, larger distance between turbines, bottom conditions, prevailing wind
direction and in particular the rated wind speed. Reducing the rated wind speed to
10 m/s, the needed area increases to 361 km2.
Using a yearly capacity factor Cc ¼ 0:45, the yearly energy production for the wind
farm becomes E ¼ 4730 GWh, corresponding to an average power production per unit
wind farm area of PA ¼ E=ð8760 AÞ ¼ 2:21 W=m2.
9.3 Wakes
As discussed in Chapter 3, the power offtake by the wind turbine causes a reduced
wind speed behind the turbine. This flow field with reduced flow velocity is called
the turbine wake. Close to the turbine, the flow field is controlled by local details
Offshore Wind Farms 341
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.010 Published online by Cambridge University Presssuch as flow around the nacelle, the lift distribution along the length of the blade,
the number of blades and the tip vortices. As the flow progresses downstream, shear
and turbulence cause mixing of the flow and the local effects diminish. The near
field may be assumed to extend to two to four rotor diameters downstream (Porté￾Agel, Bastankhah and Shamsoddin, 2020). Further downstream, in the far field,
most of the local flow effects may be disregarded and the flow may be modeled
more generically. As the distance between turbines in an offshore wind farm
normally exceeds five rotor diameters, the far field models are used in analyses of
interaction between wind turbines in a wind farm. As obtained from the momentum
theory in Chapter 3, the incident flow is slowed down in front of the turbine; this
upstream zone is called the induction zone. The induction effect may influence the
efficiency of wind turbines in the front row of a wind farm (Nygaard et al., 2020).
To fully understand and model the wakes behind wind turbines in a wind farm,
the flow must be considered in a large range of time and spatial scales, from meso￾scale wind, via flow at the wind farm scale, to the rotor scale and down to blade
cross-sectional scale. The longest scales are of hours and hundreds of kilometers,
while the shortest are in fractions of seconds and centimeters. It is not possible to
handle this within the framework of a single numerical model. Efficient computa￾tional methods are required in the planning and study of the flow within a wind
farm. Therefore, simplified models based on combined analytical and empirical
methods are needed. Validation of the wake models is challenging as detailed
mapping in time and space of the full-scale wake flow is difficult. However, wind
tunnel tests have been used to study the flow behind single turbines as well as
several turbines with interaction. Also, flow modeling using LES and RANS are
frequently applied to study the wake flow. These may, however, be too computa￾tionally demanding for use in, e.g., wind farm layout optimization.
9.3.1 Simple Wake Models
Over the years, several simple wake models suitable for the far wake have been
developed. Sanderse (2009) gives a review of some basic wake models, and in
Krutova et al. (2020) a review of some simple wake models are given and compared
to results from LES.
A 1D wake model is obtained using the actuator disk model (Chapter 3). The
velocity deficit in the wake is directly related to the thrust on the turbine. Half of
the velocity deficit is obtained at the rotor plane; the remaining half is obtained in
the downstream far field. Thus, to fulfil the continuity requirements, the wake area
must expand downstream. In the simplest version of wake models, the velocity
deficit is assumed to be constant over the wake area, as illustrated in Figure 9.5.
These are known as “top hat” models. In the “Jensen model” (Jensen, 1983; Katic,
342 Offshore Wind Energy
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.010 Published online by Cambridge University PressHøjstrup and Jensen, 1987; Krutova et al., 2020), the diameter of the wake is
assumed to expand linearly with the distance downstream from the rotor plane:
Dwð Þ¼ ξ Dð Þ 1 þ 2kξ : ½9:2
Here, ξ ¼ x=D is the nondimensional downstream distance from the rotor plane. The
assumption of a linearly expanding wake is supported by wind tunnel tests (Porté-Agel,
Bastankhah and Shamsoddin, 2020). From potential flow theory we should expect
a slower expansion, proportional to ξ1=3 (Frandsen et al., 2006). The linear expansion
and the constant k are thus assumed to be related to the turbulence level. As the
wake expands, a mixing of the wake and the ambient wind will take place, mainly
due to turbulence. From continuity, the velocity in the wake Uwð Þx may be
written as:

Uwð Þ0 is given from the induction factor. The momentum theory states
U1 ¼ Uwð Þ¼ 0 ð Þ 1  a U0, while far downstream the factor is 1ð Þ  2a . In the
Jensen model this far field factor is used for Uwð Þ0 . Under the assumption of
a linearly expanding wake and continuity according to [9.3], the wake velocity is
obtained as:

as k ≃ 0:4I0.
Based upon analysis of an inviscid spiraling vortex system behind the rotor, an
alternative expression for the velocity deficit was derived by McCormick (1999);

As seen from this expression, the velocity deficit rapidly approaches the far field
limit corresponding to the Betz theory, ΔUð Þ ξ →∞ =U0 ¼ 2a. The model predicts
no further velocity decrease beyond that value.
The top hat assumption for the velocity deficit is simple but obviously unphysical.
Therefore, a self-similar Gaussian velocity profile has been proposed (Bastankhah
and Porté-Agel, 2014):
ΔU
U0
¼ Cð Þξ f r
Rð Þξ
 : ½9:7
Here, Cð Þξ is the maximum normalized velocity deficit at x ¼ ξD, fðr=Rð ÞÞ ξ is the
radial distribution of the velocity deficit, Rð Þξ is a characteristic wake radius at the
actual position and ris the radius from the center line of the wake. f is assumed to be
independent of the downstream position, and thus the formulation is self-similar. It
is further assumed that f has a bell shape described by a Gaussian function. The
function is assumed to be valid for the velocity deficit, and thus the shape of the
wake velocity will not satisfy the self-similarity due to the shear of the mean wind
speed, as illustrated in Figure 9.4. The radial distribution of the velocity deficit can
be written as:
f r
Rð Þξ
  ¼ exp  r2
2R2

 : ½9:8
Thus, r ¼ R corresponds to the radius where the wake deficit is 0.6065 times the
maximum value at that x-position. Invoking the momentum equation and using the
turbine thrust coefficient, the following expression is obtained for the maximum
velocity deficit along the x-axis:

Here, εD is the characteristic radius of the wake at the rotor position. The expres￾sions are not valid in the near wake, but this initial value is needed for the far field

The parameter ε is obtained by equating the deficit in the mass flow obtained by the

Comparisons with LES simulations indicate that the above value of ε is slightly too

9.3.2 Summation of Wakes
In a wind farm, the wakes from the individual turbines are to be added together.
A commonly used principle (Katic, Højstrup and Jensen, 1987) is to assume a linear
expansion of the wakes and estimate the velocity deficit at a downstream position
from the first wind turbine in a row by a summation of squares of the velocity
deficits. Thus, for a row of turbines where all downstream turbines are inside the
wakes of the upstream turbines and a top hat distribution is assumed, the total
velocity deficit behind i turbines may be approximated by:
ΔU ξ ð Þ¼ U0  U ξ ð Þ ≃ U0  X

Offshore Wind Farms 345
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.010 Published online by Cambridge University PressHere, ΔUi ξ ð Þ¼ U0  Ui ξ ð Þ is the difference between the wind velocity incident
to the wind farm and the wake velocity from turbine i at the position considered,
disregarding the other turbines. The summation is to be taken over all the turbines
upstream of the position considered. It is assumed that the downstream turbines are
fully immersed in the wake from the upstream turbines. Other models have been
proposed; see an overview in Porté-Agel, Bastankhah and Shamsoddin (2020). An
alternative to the square-root sum of squares above is a linear summation of the
velocity deficits. Also, an alternative velocity deficit has been proposed, where the
difference between the incident velocity to turbine i and the wake behind that
turbine is considered, ΔUið Þ¼ ξ Uin; i  Uið Þξ . A result of [9.13] is that most of the
velocity loss in a row of wind turbines takes place behind the first few turbines. This
has been confirmed by measurements in real wind farms (Nygaard et al., 2020;
Niayifar and Porté-Agel, 2016; Barthelmie et al., 2010). When the wind direction
aligns with a row of turbines in a wind farm, there may be a significant difference in
power between the first and the second turbine in the row. For turbines further down
in the row, a more gradual decay in power output is observed, see Figure 9.6. This is
the case when the first turbine is operating below rated wind speed. If it is operating
above rated wind speed, downstream turbines may also operate above rated wind
speed and thus at rated power.
As mentioned above, if the inflow is laminar, a wake expansion proportional to ξ1=3
should be expected, while experiments in turbulent flow indicate a linear expan￾sion. Thus, there is a relation between the wake expansion and the level of
turbulence in the flow. From the theory of turbulent boundary layers, it is known

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.010 Published online by Cambridge University Pressthat turbulence is generated by shear. The shear in the wake is largest close to the
rotor, and thus a lot of turbulence is expected to be generated in this region, while
the generation of turbulence diminishes further downstream. The turbulence gen￾erated in the wake region is superposed to be the ambient turbulence. The most
common superposition principle used is a quadratic summation, i.e., the total
turbulence intensity is obtained as:
I ¼
ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
I2
0 þ I2
w
q
: ½9:14
Here, I0 is the turbulence intensity in the ambient flow and Iw is the turbulence
intensity generated in the wake. For the linearly expanding wake, it was assumed
that the expansion rate is proportional to the ambient turbulence intensity. If it is
assumed that the local expansion rate dDwð Þx =dx is proportional to the local
turbulence intensity I, the wake expansion will be largest close to the rotor and
then diminish as the turbulence intensity diminishes downstream (Nygaard et al.,
2020).
The ambient turbulence level depends upon atmospheric stability; thus, the wake
development also depends upon atmospheric stability. A more efficient mixing of
the ambient flow into the wake is expected during unstable atmospheric conditions
than during stable conditions. Comparisons of various Gaussian wake models
versus LES results under various atmospheric stability conditions can be found in
Krutova et al. (2020).
9.3.3 Other Wake Issues
9.3.3.1 Wake Meandering
The ambient turbulent wind field contains low-frequency large turbulent eddies. Such
eddies will interact with the turbine wake and result in a slowly oscillating trajectory
of the wake. This is in particular the case in the horizontal plane, but to some extent it
also takes place in the vertical plane. These oscillations are called wake meandering.
It may cause downstream turbines to partly or fully move in and out of the wakes of
upstream turbines with corresponding variations in power output and structural loads.
For floating turbines, meandering may represent a challenge, as the low natural
frequencies may be close to the frequencies of the meandering. Jacobsen and
Godvik (2020) analyzed motion responses of floating wind turbines operating in
free wind and in a wake. For the turbine operating in a wake, increased motion
responses were observed as compared to the motion responses while operating in free
wind. This was the case in stable atmospheric conditions; during neutral and unstable
conditions, the effect of the wake was more difficult to observe. It is not obvious
Offshore Wind Farms 347
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.010 Published online by Cambridge University Pressfrom the measurements by Jacobsen and Godvik (2020) whether the increased
motion responses were due to increased turbulence level or due to wake meandering.
9.3.3.2 Wind Veering
Due to the earth’s rotation the combined effect of the Coriolis force and the vertical
shear of the mean wind speed causes the mean direction of the wind to change with
height, called wind veering. The veer exists in the free wind and will also modify
the wake flow from individual turbines as well as the wake of wind farms
(Englberger and Lundquist, 2020; Murphy, Lundquist and Fleming, 2020).
9.3.3.3 Wind Farm Wakes
The collective effect of the turbine wakes in a wind farm creates a wind farm wake
(Porté-Agel, Bastankhah and Shamsoddin, 2020). The development of the wind
farm wake is closely related to the atmospheric stability condition and turbulence.
The downstream extent of the wind farm wake is expected to be much longer than
the wakes of the individual turbines. Examples of wind farm wakes are shown in
Figure 9.7. Here, the mean wind speed 10 m above sea level in the German Bight is

wind is blowing from the southeast. Reduced wind speed behind the wind farms is
clearly observed. The extent of the visible speed reduction is several times the
characteristic dimension of the wind farm. The wind farm wake may reduce the
wind speed incident to a downstream wind farm, with a reduced power production
as a possible consequence. The extent of the wind farm wake is sensitive to the
stability conditions and thus the turbulence level in the atmospheric boundary layer.
9.3.3.4 Effect of the Induction Zone
The wind speed is slowed down in front of an operating wind turbine. This is called
an induction effect. The extent of the induction zone for an individual turbine is of
the order of the rotor diameter. However, the collective action of the turbines
located in the front row of a wind farm may have a considerably larger extent.
The induction effect causes a slow-down of the wind speed in the middle section of
the front row and a speed-up along the edges. It will also cause a speed-up of the
flow above the wind farm (Porté-Agel, Bastankhah and Shamsoddin, 2020).
9.3.3.5 Wind Farm Control/Turbine Yaw
To avoid the turbine wake hitting a downstream turbine, the upstream turbine may
be yawed relative to the free wind direction. The yaw angle will result in
a transverse component of the thrust force, causing a transverse component of the
wake. Thus, the wake may be guided away from the downstream turbine. The
advantage of this approach is increased production and reduced fatigue loads on
downstream turbines, while the disadvantage may be reduced power production of
the upstream turbine. Together with power control of the individual turbines in
a wind farm, turbine yaw and wake steering may be parts of a wind farm control
strategy aiming at optimizing the power production from the farm and at the same
time minimizing the fatigue loads on the turbines.

length theory implies that close to a wall but inside the turbulent boundary layer, the
turbulent shear stress is related to the vertical gradient of the mean flow, i.e.:

range of validity of [A.16] is typically 20 < z=z0 < 400, while C is approximately 5.5. For
z=z0 < 10 the velocity profile is according to the laminar flow expression ([A.12]). For
atmospheric boundary layers, the logarithmic velocity profile is assumed valid throughout
the surface layer during neutral atmospheric conditions and with a constant surface rough￾ness upwind of the section considered. That is, the turbulent fluxes are assumed constant in
this region (Lee, 2018).

be invoked (see, e.g., Curle and Davies, 1968). The assumption behind Prandtl’s mixing
length theory implies that close to a wall but inside the turbulent boundary layer, the
turbulent shear stress is related to the vertical gradient of the mean flow, i.e.:
2 At an air temperature of 15°C and 1 atm pressure, the density of air is ρa ¼ 1:225kg=m3 and the kinematic
viscosity ν ¼ 1:470  105m2=s.

The constant l is thus assumed to be proportional to the vertical distance from the wall,
l ¼ kz. The shear stress close to wall but outside the laminar sublayer is thus obtained by
combing [A.10] and [A.13] as:

Integrating, the horizontal mean velocity is obtained as:

This is equivalent to [2.3], where k ¼ ka ≃ 0:40 is recognized as the von Kármán constant.
z0 is a roughness length scale given by z0 ¼ ν=u. According to Curle and Davies (1968), the
range of validity of [A.16] is typically 20 < z=z0 < 400, while C is approximately 5.5. For
z=z0 < 10 the velocity profile is according to the laminar flow expression ([A.12]). For
atmospheric boundary layers, the logarithmic velocity profile is assumed valid throughout
the surface layer during neutral atmospheric conditions and with a constant surface rough￾ness upwind of the section considered. That is, the turbulent fluxes are assumed constant in
this region (Lee, 2018).

The Laplace Transform
Fourier transform is a useful tool to analyze stationary dynamic processes.1
Similarly, Laplace transform is useful for studying transient response and control
systems. Frequently, time domain differential equations are easier to manipulate
and solve in the Laplace space and then transform back to the time domain.
Details about Laplace transformation are given in standard mathematical textbooks,
e.g., Butkov (1973). The Laplace transform of a time-dependent function y tð Þ is
given by:
Y sð Þ¼ Lfy tð Þg ¼ ð
∞
0
esty tð Þdt: ½C:1
y tð Þis defined on the interval ½0; ∞Þ and is real.s ¼ σ þ iω is complex. The condition for the
transform to be valid is that:
ð
∞
0
eσat
y tð Þdt < ∞: ½C:2
Here, σa is real. The lowest value of σa that satisfies [C.2] is denoted the convergence axis of
y tð Þ. Here, a simple second-order linear differential equation is considered as an illustrative
example; i.e., consider the equation:
mx€ þ bx_ þ kx ¼ f tð Þ; ½C:3
with initial conditions at t ¼ 0: xð Þ¼ 0 x0 and x_ð Þ¼ 0 x_0. Further, f tðÞ¼ 0 for t < 0. The
equation may be split into a homogeneous and a particular part:
x€h þ 2λx_h þ ω2
0xh ¼ 0
xhð Þ¼ 0 x0
x_hð Þ¼ 0 x_0

ð Þ s þ λ 2 þ ω2

The critical damping of the system is given by bcr ¼ 2mω0 or λcr ¼ ω0 . Assuming that the
system is lightly damped, i.e., λ≪λcr ¼ ω0, and invoking the inverse Laplace transforms
(see Table C.1), the solution of [C.10] may be written as:
xhðÞ¼ t x0eλt cosð Þþ ωt x_0 þ λx0
ω eλt sinð Þ ωt ; ½C:11
where ω2 ¼ ω2
0  λ2  	 ≃ ω2
0 for a lightly damped system.
The solution for the particular part is obtained by invoking the convolution theorem for
Laplace transforms, i.e.:

Rotational Terms in the Added Mass Matrix
for a Pontoon
Consider the rotational acceleration around each of the axes and the resulting moments
about the other axes.1 Reference is made to Figure 7.8. The following contributions are
obtained:

Here, ΔM11 is the moment around the x-axis from a small section of the pontoon of length
ΔL located at ð Þ x; y;z due to an acceleration around the x-axis η€4. α is the angle between the
pontoon axis and the x-axis. ah and av are the horizontal and vertical accelerations of the
section considered, ah being the horizontal component perpendicular to the pontoon axis.
Að Þ 2D
h is the 2D added mass for translation in horizontal direction perpendicular to the
pontoon axis. Zero added mass is assumed for translation in the axial direction. Að Þ 2D v is the
2D added mass for translation in vertical direction.
Similarly, the moments around the y-and z-axes become:

The effect of the added mass at the end surfaces of the pontoon should be added to
the above contributions. Consider an end surface located in x; y;zp

ð Þ x; y;z direction become:

A notch filter modifies a stochastic input signal x tð Þ to a new signal y tð Þ in which the
signal components with frequencies in a narrow neighborhood of the filter frequency
f0 are removed.1 Normally, filtering of a time series is most conveniently performed
in the frequency domain, i.e., the time series considered is converted by Fourier
transform to frequency domain. Here, the wanted transfer function is applied and
finally the filtered time series is obtained by inverse Fourier transform. This proced￾ure is not feasible if the complete time series is not available at the time of filtering.
In real-time application, filtering in time domain is thus required. Here, the proced￾ure for using linear digital filters in time domain as outlined by Press et al. (1989) is
summarized.
Consider a time series x tð Þ sampled at an interval dt, so the sampled time
series forms the sequence xn, n ¼ ½1; n max. A filtered version of xn may then be
obtained by:
yn ¼ X
M
k¼0
ck xnk þX
N
j¼1
djynj: ½E:1
The M þ 1 coefficients ck and theN coefficients dj define the response of the filter. IfN ¼ 0, the
filter is denoted as non-recursive, i.e., former values of y do not contribute to yn . If N > 0, the
filter is denoted asrecursive. In this case the values of dj must fulfil certain requirements to ensure
stability of the filter procedure. In the frequency domain the filter transfer function can be
written as:
H f ð Þ¼

https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009341455.015 Published online by Cambridge University PressWe normally know the wanted shape of the filter in the frequency domain. The challenge
is then to find a set of coefficients, ck and dj, that can approximate this shape without
having too many terms in the summations in [D.2]. For this purpose, Press et al. (1989)
show how a bilinear transformation method may be used. The complex variable z is
introduced as:
z ¼ e2πifdt: ½E:3
The frequencies are limited by the Nyquist frequency, i.e., 1<2fdt < 1. A new variable w is
introduced. w maps this frequency interval onto the interval ∞ < w< ∞ by the
transformation:
w ¼ i
1  z
1 þ z
: ½E:4
Note that w becomes real for real frequencies. Using the above principles, a
simple notch filter that filters out the frequencies in the vicinity of f0 can be
written as:
H f ð Þ¼ w2  w2
0
ð Þ w  iεw0
2  w2
0
: ½E:5
Here, w0 is obtained from [E.3] and [E.4] by inserting f0 . ε is a small parameter controlling
the bandwidth of the notch filter. Substituting z for w in [E.5] and performing the arithmetic,
the filter coefficients are obtained as:
c0 ¼ 1 þ w2

ð Þ 1 þ εw0
2 þ w2

Use of Notch Filter on Wind Spectrum
Consider a wind time series generated according to the Kaimal spectrum with mean
wind speed of 10 m/s and turbulence intensity of 10%. The time series has a duration of
1000 s and is sampled at 0.50 s intervals. Figure E.1 shows the theoretical Kaimal
spectrum, together with the spectrum obtained after having generated a time history of
Appendix E 365

the Kaimal spectrum. The random oscillations around the theoretical spectrum are
evident and are a result of random phases, finite length of record and finite sampling
rate.
A notch filter with filter frequency f0 ¼ 0:2 Hz and bandwidth ε ¼ 0:1 is applied. The
characteristic of this filter is shown in Figure E.2. Applying [E.6], the filter constants
become:
c0¼ 0:9436; c1¼ -1:5268; c2¼c0
d1¼ 1:5250; d2¼ -0:8891:

Figure E.1 shows the spectrum of the time series as obtained after applying the notch
filter. The dip at 0.2 Hz is evident.
