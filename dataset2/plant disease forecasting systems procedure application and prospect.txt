SingaporePreface 
Plant diseases are considered as a great threat as it can cause significant reduction in 
both quality and quantity of agricultural products. The International Crops Research 
Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and the Department of Science and 
Technology (DST) of the Central Government launched a plant protection project to 
carry out research on diseases and insect pests that cause huge crop loss. The study 
recorded that diseases and insect pests cause a crop loss of over USD 8.48 billion 
annually, and this loss is likely to grow at least fourfold under the climate change 
scenario (The Times of India 29. 2. 2012). The colossal losses in agriculture 
produces raise the accusing finger towards the abysmal state of plant protection 
system of the country. It may be stated that pesticide consumption in India is limited 
to about 25% of the arable land, which is the lowest in the world (Credit Analysis 
Research Limited, September, 2011, p. 84). However, the traditional way of appli￾cation of agrochemical fungicides on fixed calendar dates to prevent the disease has 
some attendant side effects. The fungicides pollute the environment and reduce the 
quality of the produces. Moreover, as the intensity of the disease between seasons 
suffers major variations, the use of agrochemicals on fixed calendar dates is not 
justified. In recent years, an increasing consciousness about environmental pollution 
due to pesticides and development of fungicide-resistant strains in plant pathogens 
have challenged plant pathologists to search for eco-friendly tools for disease 
management. Due to the aforementioned problems, it is necessary to have adequate 
economic and environmentally acceptable strategies to manage the epidemic devel￾opment of plant diseases in order to decrease the crop losses and minimize the use of 
chemical pesticides. Early and accurate diagnoses and pathogen surveillance on 
local, regional and global scales, vis-à-vis prediction of outbreaks of the disease in 
epidemic form, may allow time for development and application of mitigation 
strategies. A forecast of the need for, and the correct timing of, any preventative 
treatment should, therefore, result in reduced pesticide usage. Thus, plant disease 
forecasting, also known as forewarning system, is a management system that 
predicts the occurrence of disease and increase or decrease in disease severity. The 
prediction of disease outbreaks allows sprays to be applied at times when they are 
most effective. It may allow the number of sprays to be decreased, reducing the cost 
of crop production and the environmental impact of pesticides. In commercial 
agriculture, prediction of disease is also important for predicting crop yields. This
vknowledge is used to predict the long-term prices of a commodity in the market￾place. Hence, the forecasting systems guide the growers to make economic decisions 
about disease treatments for control. Then, in order to obtain sustainable practices for 
strategic and tactical management of diseases and also to decrease its environmental 
impact, it is necessary to understand the determining factors of epidemics. The 
interaction of susceptible host plant, virulent pathogen and favourable environmental 
conditions leads to the development of the disease. The amount of each of the three 
components of disease and their interaction in the development of the disease are 
affected by a fourth component, time. Besides, humans affect disease development 
in various ways. They affect the type of plants grown in an area, their level of 
resistance, time of planting, density of planting, etc. However, usually, the 
forecasting systems accurately predict when the three factors—host, environment 
and pathogen—(also known as the disease triangle) interact in such a fashion that the 
disease can occur and cause economic losses. 
vi Preface
The successful development of plant disease forecasting systems also requires 
proper development of models and their validation. Forecasting models are often 
based on relationship like various types of regression analysis. Other relations can be 
modelled using population growth curves. Polycyclic epidemics are usually 
modelled by using logistic model, whereas monocyclic epidemics can be best 
modelled by monomolecular models. Computers are now valuable tools for simula￾tion and modelling of plant disease forecasting. There is a special class of computer 
program, called expert system, that emulates decision-making logic which human 
experts use to solve problems in their respective fields. Web-based expert systems 
provide a comprehensive model delivery system through the internet. The use of 
near-real-time and forecast weather data is key to true forecast disease outbreak at 
local and regional bases. This is designed to access and retrieve weather data from an 
automatic weather station and from a remote database with 7-day weather forecast 
for the same locality. The model is initiated through a web interface, and the 
simulation starts by selecting heading date. 
The awareness, popularity and interest in modelling; derivation of equations for 
plant disease forecasting; or construction and use of web-based expert systems 
among plant pathologists in India, unlike the developed countries, are not very 
encouraging. Apparently, less understanding in mathematics and computer program￾ming of agricultural scientists and lack of appropriate instrumental facilities in most 
of the state agriculture universities (SAUs) and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (extension 
centre) are the main impediments. Besides, the construction of the forecasting 
system is a rigorous interdisciplinary field, employing sophisticated techniques 
and requiring a good knowledge of its core areas. But it is obvious that without 
application of the disease forewarning technology, full advantage of integrated pest 
management (IPM) strategy cannot be achieved. 
The book aims to review the current scenario of the use of forecasting system in 
precision agriculture in India and the potentiality to construct new ones to suit thecountry’s need. It has also attempted to provide easy guidelines to the scientists who 
wish to step into the plant disease forecasting research.

When I attempted to develop a forecasting system for malformation disease of 
mango, due to my less understanding in mathematics and lack of skill in advanced 
computer application, I faced an uphill task until Sunil Kumar, Head (ex) of the 
Department of Agricultural Statistics and founder incharge of the Agricultural 
Research Information System cell (ARIS, ICAR) in N. D. University of Agriculture 
& Technology, Uttar Pradesh, and Dr. Pinaki Chakraborty, Assistant Professor, 
Department of Computer Sciences of Netaji Subhas University of Technology, 
New Delhi, extended their unstinted cooperation. Later, we jointly published many 
research papers, and with the help of Dr. Pinaki, it became possible to develop an 
expert system that can predict the outbreak of mango malformation 6 months prior to 
the disease appearance. The field data used in this book have been taken from the Ph. 
D. thesis of Dr. Mukesh Pandey, Scientist (Plant Pathology), Sher-e-Kashmir Uni￾versity of Agricultural Sciences and Technology, Jammu, and also from the M.Sc. 
(Ag) thesis of Rajesh Kumar, Plant Protection Officer, Govt. of Uttar Pradesh. I 
express my gratitude to Professor (Math.) Prabhat Mittal who is also a co-author. 
Without his active and enthusiastic involvement, this project could not be realized. 
Dr. Rina Chakrabarti, senior Professor (Fishery), and HOD, Zoology of Delhi 
University, Delhi, is the soul of this endeavour. I express my indebtedness to all 
of them. 
In 2011, while I approached the famous publishing house like Springer for 
publication of my first monograph on mango malformation, I was indeed very 
nervous. In that critical juncture, Madam Zuzana Bernhart, the then Senior Publish￾ing Editor, instilled confidence and provided guidance to a novice author. And thus, 
my dream was realized, which initially seemed to be impossible. A decade has past, 
and now she is Executive Editor, but her zeal to stand up for struggling authors/ 
scientists has not been eroded. This time also, her helping hand took me to my 
esteemed readers. I am under her deep obligation. 
I hope that in future those who step in the epidemiological research will not face 
hurdles like me and this book will come to their aid and play the same role what 
Sunil Kumar, Dr. Pinaki and Prof. Prabhat did for me.

Historic Plant Disease Epidemics 1 
The outbreak of diseases on various crops in an epiphytotic form has been reported 
occasionally from different parts of the world. These are of course of great concern 
but cannot be termed as a disaster. Earlier when plant protection measures were 
either lacking or diffuse, two plant disease epidemics appeared in rapacious form and 
ravaged the social and economic fabrics of the mankind so severely that the wounds 
inflicted by these epidemics have not been yet healed up. The two epidemics referred 
here are (i) Irish potato famine triggered by late blight disease in 1845 in which one 
and half million people starved and a similar number emigrated during the famine 
and (ii) the epidemic of brown spot disease of rice in 1942 resulting into a calamitous 
famine in undivided Bengal in 1943 when altogether about three million people died. 
1.1 Irish Famine 
In the uplands of the Andes in the Lake Titicaca situated between Peru and Bolivia, 
the potato crop (Solanum tuberosum) originated. And its pathogen, the fungus, 
Phytophthora infestans, which causes potato late blight seems to be originated in 
nearby Mexico where the occurrence of both mating types of the fungus is very 
common and abundant. Then the fungus moved towards north-eastern region of the 
USA and caused their late blight epidemic of potato in 1843. From North America, 
the pathogen travelled to England with cargo on a ship. Winds from southern 
England further carried the fungus to the countryside around Dublin of Ireland. 
The fungal spores settled on leaves of healthy potato plants, multiplied and carried 
by cool breeze to surrounding plants. Incidentally at that time, Ireland relied 
primarily upon two high-yielding potato varieties. Thus, a single infected plant 
under ideal moist conditions could infect thousands in just few days in vast stretch 
of monoculture of susceptible potato crop and break out an epidemic. Failures of 
potato crops were reported for a number of years during the cool and rainy 40 s. 
Between 1800 and 1845, there were 16 incidents of food shortages in various parts of

across the field of entire Ireland, and the fungus getting an ideal cool and moist 
condition spread like wildfire. Soon the potato leaves turned black, curled and rotted 
and there was crop failure at high magnitude nationwide for the first time. Everyone 
was hoping that the worst would be over in the next crop season and to harvest a 
good blight-free crop. But unfortunately, the blight devastated potato crops for the 
next 5 consecutive years (1845–1850) in Ireland. In the 1840s, almost half of the 
population in Ireland depended on potatoes to survive. Thus, the consecutive crop 
failures for 5 years brought about concomitant catastrophic consequences (Anon 
2008). In the first year of famine, deaths from starvation were kept down due to the 
imports of Indian corn and the survival of about half the original potato crop. But 
later apathy and callous attitude of the British government officials and 
administrators failed to bring relief to the million starving. A loss of 1 million 
lives due to starvation and diseases. A loss of 1.5 million due to emigration resulted 
in a large Irish diaspora in many parts of North America. Ireland’s 1845 population 
of eight million dropped to 5.5 million by 1860 (Schumann and D’Arcy 2000). 
Initially, the disease appeared to be a mysterious one and was attributed to many 
factors that are mostly unscientific and full of superstition. Finally, the research 
evidence of Anton deBary in 1861 (DeBarry 1876) conclusively proved that the 
fungus P. infestans with the help of its millions of white spores ravaged the potato 
crop in Ireland. It is for the first time a microorganism was proven to be the cause of a 
plant disease and this marked the initiation of a new paradigm of science, i.e. Plant 
Pathology.
2 1 Historic Plant Disease Epidemics
1.2 Bengal Famine 
The principal cause of the short supply of rice in 1943 was the epidemic of brown 
spot disease that attacked the rice crop in Bengal in 1942 (Padmanabhan 1973). The 
disease caused 40–90% yield reductions in rice. Nothing as devastating as the 
Bengal rice brown spot epidemic of 1942 has been recorded in the history of plant 
pathology. The situation was further worsened by administrative failure. At that 
time, food administration in India was the responsibility of provincial governments. 
The Bengal provincial government failed to make up the food shortage through 
imports because World War II had cut off imports of rice from Burma. Britain, 
Canada and the USA were sending food elsewhere according to wartime priorities. 
In provinces, like Punjab, rice was not in short supply, but they prohibited rice 
exports to other regions. There was very little marketable surplus from 1942 harvest, 
thus, the price of rice in Bengal soared beyond the reach of the ordinary people. The 
Bengal government made the feeding of the urban Calcutta population a priority and 
requisitioned rice supplies from rural areas. The populations from the villages 
migrated to the cities in search of employment and rice. Finding neither they slowly 
died of starvation. And the heart rendering starvation death of several thousands of 
men, women and children continued from October to December in all the important 
cities in Bengal.1.3 African Famine 3
The nature and extent of the abnormal weather parameters in the epiphytotic year 
of 1942 were studied to explain the outbreak (Padmanabhan 1973). The environ￾mental factors of 1942 were compared with those of the years of 1941, 1943 and 
1944. The salient observations of his (Padmanabhan 1973) studies are enumerated 
below: 
1. In November 1942, the average minimum temperature was higher but on the 
contrary, the average daily range of temperature was lower. 
2. In September 1942, the cloudiness in daytime was greater with a subsequent 
lesser number of bright sunshine hours in both September and November. 
3. In November 1942, there were 2–6 rainy days while in other 2 years, i.e. 1943 and 
1944, there were no rains during the same period. However, in 1943, there were 
rains but that was only for 2–3 days which was lesser than that in 1942. 
4. The average relative humidity both in the morning and evening hours during the 
whole September of the epiphytotic year as compared to other years was higher. 
5. Deficiency of nutrients like nitrogen and potassium and upsetting of iron–man￾ganese ratio due to leaching of the nutrients from the soil caused by heavy rainfall 
in 1942 predisposed the crop to the Helminthosporium – infection. 
Thus, in November 1942, the weather conditions viz. cloudy days, slight drizzle 
and high minimum temperature provided exceptionally favourable conditions for 
abundant continuous spore release and infection. Further, rice shows increased 
susceptibility to Helminthosporium oryzae with increase in age and thus attains the 
maximum susceptibility at the time of flowering and maturity. Incidentally through￾out Bengal, the crop reached the flowering and maturing stages in November– 
December (Padmanabhan 1973). 
Based on the observations on meteorological conditions in the epiphytotic year 
and simultaneous experimental evidence on the relation of the environmental 
parameters with different phases of the infection process, a condition for possible 
outbreak of the epidemic was envisaged (Padmanabhan 1973). Excessive rainfall in 
September, uniformly favourable temperature of 20–29.4 ° C throughout the days 
continuously for 2 months (October–November), unusually cloudy weather and 
rains in November, reduced hours of sunshine (<75%) during October–November 
may constitute a warning that a severe epidemic is likely to occur. 
1.3 African Famine 
One of the worst holocausts in recent times was witnessed in the form of a 
catastrophic famine in the African countries viz. Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia 
(McKie and Rice 2007). A deadly new strain of black stem rust fungus (Puccinia 
graminis) destroyed the wheat crop across the countries and the loss was at the tune 
of 80% leading to starvation and death of millions of people. Black stem rust itself is 
nothing new. It has blighted wheat production in many parts of the world for 
thousands of years. In 1954, the disease wiped out 40% of the crop in NorthAmerica. After this epidemic, an invigorating effort was initiated at CIMMYT in 
Mexico on developing wheat cultivars resistant to the stem rust and finally rust 
resistant and high-yielding wheat varieties were developed that ended stem rust 
outbreak and banished chronic hunger in much of the world. Since then, after 
40 years, there was no outbreak, as a result, complacency gripped the scientists 
and necessary research programmes against the stem rust were dismantled. 
4 1 Historic Plant Disease Epidemics
In Uganda, a virulent strain of the stem rust was found to be evolved in 1999 and 
no wheat crops anywhere are resistant to it (Pretorius et al. 2000). The newly 
developed strain of P. graminis has been designated as Ug99 . A gene complex called 
Sr31 is the backbone of stem rust resistance in most varieties cultivated worldwide. 
Another widely used resistance gene in wheat is Sr24. Ug99 has the ability to defeat 
both gene complexes. In fact only 10 out of 50 genes known for resistance to stem 
rust work even partially against Ug99. The drastic reduction in yield was inflicted by 
Ug99 at a time when wheat consumption by the rising population had outstripped the 
crop production in the last 6 years since 2002, stocks were at their lowest since 1972 
and wheat price skyrocketed. The conditions were highly pernicious and afflicted 
vast human destruction in African countries. 
Across Africa, more than 200 million people depend on cassava as their staple 
food. Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is the most important biotic constraint of 
cassava production. This disease spread from its source in Tanzania during 1894, 
occurring Africa-wide by 1987. The disease is caused by white fly-transmitted 
Begomo viruses, including African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) west of the Rift 
Valley, and East African cassava mosaic virus (EACMV) east of the Rift Valley. In 
1988, an epidemic of a highly virulent variant of EACMV (EACMV-Ug; arising 
from the interspecific recombination of EACMV and ACMV) began in Uganda and 
spread throughout East and Central Africa, causing crop losses on a scale that 
required international intervention to prevent widespread famine. In Uganda, cas￾sava production plummeted from a high of 3.5 million tons in 1989 to 2.25 million 
tons in 1996 as a result of the emergence of EACMV-Ug. In the north and east of 
Uganda, the epidemic led to famine. Food insecurity resulting from this Emerging 
Infectious Disease (EID) still threatens regions of East, Central and West Africa 
(Anderson et al. 2004).

Epidemic Factors 2 
It is necessary to understand the determining factors of epidemics. Three criteria are 
usually considered, i.e. host factors, pathogen factors and weather factors (Francl 
2001). The important host factors that contribute to build up an epidemic are: 
(i) genetic susceptibility of a cultivar to the pathogenic infection, (ii) disease prone￾ness in the host which can be induced due to imbalanced nutrition or environmental 
factors, (iii) monoculture of susceptible cultivar over a vast stretch of land and 
(iv) proximity of the host to the primary source of inoculum or presence of an 
alternate host. 
Successful infection can be caused (i) if the pathogen is virulent, (ii) can complete 
the disease cycle rapidly or it can produce copious amount of spores, (iii) the 
inoculum can disperse rapidly, (iv) the propagules has the capacity to survive long 
(e.g. overwintering) and (v) the pathogen can adapt themselves to various adverse 
conditions. 
But the mere presence of a virulent pathogen over a susceptible host cannot break 
out an epidemic unless favourable weather conditions such as optimum temperature, 
moisture and light for sporulation, dispersal, infection and survival of pathogen are 
available. 
For developing a plant disease, coming of a plant in contact with an agent 
(pathogen) is the first condition. But mere contact does not guarantee the develop￾ment of diseases. For example, in phyllosphere of many plants, a large number of 
microorganisms often occur but all of them do not produce disease symptoms on that 
particular plant. Although some of these microorganisms are capable to produce 
symptoms in other plants. Hence, the host plant that will come in contact with the 
microorganism must be susceptible to that particular agent and the pathogen must 
have the ability to produce symptoms on that host. During the contact and interaction 
of these two components (host and the pathogen), the prevailing weather conditions 
must be conducive for the growth and multiplication of the pathogen, and the host 
under the same set of weather conditions will be in a growth stage that will not resist 
the infection process. For example, in a polyetic disease (usually on perennial plants

years there could be inoculum build up), malformation disease of mango, the 
pathogen, Fusarium moniliforme var. subglutinans (F. mangifera), occurs over the 
host throughout the year. But it produces the floral malformation symptoms during 
January–February, when mild temperature along with high relative humidity 
becomes conducive for the growth and infection process of the fungus; on the host 
side, the same induces new flower buds which provide the pathogen new infection 
sites; phenolic contents of the host cells decrease while its C/N ratio increases that 
lead to reduction in host resistance but provide better supply of nourishment to the 
invading parasite (Chakrabarti 2011). The interactions of these three factors are 
necessary for the disease to occur and are visualized as a triangle and generally 
referred as disease triangle (Fig. 2.1a). Each side of the triangle indicates one of the 
three factors, i.e. host, pathogen and environment while the enclosed area of the 
triangle represents the amount of disease in a plant. Each component of the triangle 
may vary greatly which ultimately affects the area of the triangle, i.e. amount of the 
disease. Forecasting systems are based on assumptions about the pathogen’s 
interactions with the host and environment, the disease triangle.
8 2 Epidemic Factors
Fig. 2.1 Plant disease triangle (a) and disease tetrahedron (b) 
Here are few examples to explain how the variations in the components of the 
disease triangle increase or decrease the amount of the disease. The examples have 
been drawn from the malformation disease of mango caused by the fungal pathogen, 
F. mangiferae. The following example shows that not only the change of pathogen 
but its initial population over the host greatly influences the final disease outcome 
even though the other two factors, i.e. host and the environment remain the same. In 
an orchard, the number of initial inoculum levels in two groups of cv Chausa differed 
substantially while other two factors, i.e. the host (in the present case cv. Chausa) 
and environment were similar. In the first group of plants, the initial inoculum over 
emerging flower buds was 19.9 colony forming unit/bud and on the second group of 
similar types of plants, the inoulum was measured at 41. At the end of the crop 
season, the number of malformed panicles in the first and second groups of plants 
were counted as 5.33 and 27.00/plant (Chakrabarti et al. 2003).References 9
The changes in host factors may affect the disease outcome even when other two 
constituents in the triangle are similar. Gaur and Chakrabarti (2009) in a survey 
recorded that in the same nursery bed, 50.3% of seedlings of the susceptible 
cv. Amrapali showed symptoms of malformation but on the comparatively less 
susceptible cv. Langra, the incidence of malformation was 17.56%. 
Singh et al. (1979) evidenced that with the change of climatic conditions, the 
number of malformed panicles varied considerably. They kept a group of plants of 
cv. Amrapali under polythene cover while the other similar group adjacent to the 
covered one was in open. The initial inoculum level of both groups was also more or 
less the same. Due to the polythene cover, the maximum (25–31.7 to 31–34 °C) and 
minimum (6.75–12.8 to 7.75–14 °C) temperature increased considerably. Due to this 
climatic variation, the number of malformed panicles differed significantly (25 in 
open while only 2 malformed panicles/plant under polythene cover). 
All the three components of the triangle (Fig.2.1a) (Francl 2001), their interaction 
and thereby the amount of disease developed are greatly influenced by the fourth 
factor, i.e. time. When the time component is incorporated in the disease triangle, a 
disease tetrahedron or disease pyramid (Fig.2.1b) is formed. The component time 
identifies the specific time of a year when a particular event of the disease develop￾ment occurs. For example, the development of floral malformation takes place 
during the month of February. It also refers to the length of time (incubation period) 
during which an event of the infection process takes place. Chand and Chakrabarti 
(2003) inoculated mango floral buds with F. mangifera inoculum at the end of 
December. The first visible symptoms were noticed at the end of January. Thus, 
the length of the incubation phase was about 1 month. Since after the disease 
initiation, the symptom development of the inoculated buds was in progression up 
to the end of February; thereafter, further development was ceased. Hence, the length 
of temporal disease progression or exponential growth phase was approximately 
3 months. Further humans themselves may greatly affect all four components and the 
disease outcome by their cultural practices. Thus, it should be considered as a 
distinct fifth component. Forecasting systems can only be designed if there is an 
understanding of the actual disease triangle parameters. In fact, forecasting systems 
predict when the three factors – host, environment and pathogen – all interact in such 
a fashion that disease can occur and cause economic losses.

Predicting Variables 3 
Predicting equations or the forecasting systems are usually constructed based on the 
initial inoculum level or population of vectors or weather parameters. In this context, 
the hypothesis of Shrun (1978) is worth mentioning. Following is the brief account 
of the predicting variables. 
3.1 Initial Inoculum 
Some disease forecasting methods are based solely on the initial population level of 
the pathogen. The amount of disease already present at the initial stage of the disease 
build up is also used as predicting variable. This approach is effective for diseases 
that develop steadily under relatively uniform or predictable weather conditions. For 
example, the dead necrotic malformed panicles which served as the site of prolifera￾tion and source of dissemination of the pathogen play the most important role in the 
perpetuation of malformation outbreak of malformation disease of mango. Thus, 
malformed panicles to be developed in the forthcoming crop season in February can 
be predicted by counting the number of existing malformed panicles of yesteryear in 
October (Chakrabarti 2011). Nagarajan et al. (1977) used uredospores to forecast the 
outbreak the stem rust in the susceptible wheat cultivar. For this purpose, they 
monitored for 5 years the presence of uredospores in rain samples and the first 
appearance of stem rust on susceptible wheat cultivars. Finally, they predicted that 
the disease would develop in the field 36 days after the first catch of the uredospores 
in rain water. 
In case of virus, disease predictions are based on the population of their respective 
vectors. In West Bengal, a prediction model for the outbreak of tungro virus disease 
of rice was developed by monitoring the population of its vector, i.e. rice green leaf 
hopper (Mukhopadhyay and Chowdhury 1973).

3.2 Weather 
The weather parameters like temperature, moisture in the form of leaf wetness, or 
more common factors such as rainfall, dew and relative humidity that affect leaf 
wetness, sunshine, direction and velocity of wind, etc. are considered as important 
microclimate variables and are frequently used to develop disease forecasts. Some 
disease forecasting systems have been based on the broad-scale weather forecasts, 
but it has long been known that the weather within the crop, i.e. microclimate has a 
more direct impact on disease than broad-scale weather. Besides the period of 
sporulation by the pathogen, dispersal of the spores, time of host invasion and 
disease development are known as critical period. Thus, for accurate prediction, 
the weather conditions during these biological events are considered. 
Stewart’s Wilt caused by the bacterium Pantoea stewartii overwinters in the gut 
of the corn flea beetle during the winter. The adult beetles when feed on the plant 
seedlings in spring, transfer the bacterium to the healthy seedlings. Therefore, 
survival of the insect vector through the winter months is the key factor in the 
development of the disease. Thus, one of the first forecasting systems was success￾fully designed on monitoring temperature during the three critical winter months. 
However, temperature is an important microclimatic variable affecting plant disease 
in temperate regions, where seasonal and day-to-day temperature fluctuations are 
great. It is not likely to be so important in the tropics, where day-to-day variation in 
temperature is slight. 
Many disease forecasting systems involve monitoring moisture in the form of leaf 
wetness, or the more commonly measured factors such as rainfall, dew and relative 
humidity that affect leaf wetness. Nagarajan and Joshi (1980) recorded that the 
development of leaf rust over the Indo-Gangetic Plain is related to the number of 
rainy days. Western disturbances and the associated rainfall enable bulk deposition 
of inoculum of diverse pathogen virulence over northwest India from the eastern 
side. It also provides moisture for pathogen infection, enhancing possibilities of 
epidemics. Thus, they proposed the ‘Bioclimatic Model for Leaf Rust’ based on the 
number of rainy days from January to mid-April over northwestern India. An early 
forecasting system for late blight of potato in the Netherlands relied upon the 
so-called ‘Four Dutch Rules’ which combined the criteria for temperature, leaf 
wetness, cloudiness and rainfall (van Everdingen 1926). 
Sometimes these factors are combined with measurements of temperature. In the 
United Kingdom, a forecast for late blight of potato was developed based on 
‘Beaumont periods’ (Beaumont 1947). A ‘Beaumont period’ is a period of 2 days 
with a temperature not less than 10 ° C and a relative humidity of 75% or above. The 
blight is predicted to occur 10 days after such a period. 
It was considered that the forecasting system would have been more accurate if it 
had included the variable for the amount of initial inoculum. Based on field epiphy￾totic studies, Nagaran and Joshi (1978) developed a model for predicting stem rust 
severity for 7 days in advance with the following variables: mean disease severity for 
the past week and mean weekly minimum temperature (°C) and relative humidity 
(%) expected for the next week.3.2 Weather 13
There have been many successful disease forecasting systems, usually based on 
monitoring and forecasting of weather and pathogen inoculum loads. These simple 
models have always relied on a degree of understanding of the biology and epide￾miology of the disease, they do not attempt a complete modelling of all factors 
involved in the disease. There are too many poorly understood interactions between 
biological and meteorological factors to allow accurate predictions. In such a situa￾tion the most minor, unpredictable factors can cause a huge mismatch between the 
calculated and actual disease outcomes. Shrun (1978) suggested that interlocking 
effects of different parts of the infection chain, and effects of external factors such as 
environmental parameters, vectors, etc. all should be included to construct a most 
successful forecast. Thus, with increasing knowledge, the predictive value of a 
model can be improved. 
It has been mentioned that earlier attempts have been made to predict the disease 
outbreak by analyzing and quantifying the influence of meteorological factors. But 
complication to predict on the basis of meteorological factors arises from 
interactions between meteorological conditions and different effects resulting from 
them on pathogens and hosts at every developmental stage. Therefore, useful 
weather parameters that exert the greatest influence on the epidemic should be 
identified in the growth chamber study and the values of the parameters are estimated 
by field experiments. This combined approach seems to be the best to generate 
quantitative data and has better insight into the causal relationship of the patho￾system. 
Similarly in many predicting systems, the initial inoculum level is considered as 
predicting factor. But the host also plays an important role in the final disease 
outcome. The host like the pathogen is usually in a state of continuous change. 
Diseases alter plant development in many ways. The dynamic interaction between 
host and pathogen with special reference to the growth stimulation caused by the 
disease, time-dependent-susceptibility and physiological scale for disease develop￾ment should be observed and quantified. 
To explain the patho-system and to predict its behaviour, the interlocking effects 
of different parts of the infection chain and the effects of external factors should be 
comprehended. This aspect demands detailed knowledge of the biological process. 
To quantify or model mathematically the changes in disease level with passage of 
time, all components of a disease cycle are used. This is known as analytical 
approach to modelling. In the analytical approach, every phase of the fungal life 
cycle is modelled separately starting from infection, invasion, incubation and symp￾tom development and proceeds to sporulation and dispersal. Construction of 
forecasting system based on initial inoculum level or weather data is very common 
but these may not be sufficient for accurate prediction.14 3 Predicting Variables
3.3 Shrun’s Hypothesis 
Shrun (1978) built a framework of a typical epidemic. The epidemic system is 
comprised of several states that represent the stages through which the pathogen 
passes as the disease progresses, for example the propagules, the invasion and 
development of symptoms, etc. Shrun (1978) described these stages as state 
variables. 
The rates of transformation from one state to another are influenced by external 
variables. These comprise the factors of the host or the environment. An external 
variable may either slow down or accelerate the rate of change from one state to 
another. A single external factor can exert even opposite influence at different parts 
of state variables. The external variables act over the state variables but they are not 
part of the system. 
Pandey (2003) and Chakrabarti (2011) envisaged a schematic diagram following 
the hypothesis of Shrun (1978) depicting the dynamics of the malformation disease 
(Fig. 3.1). In this schematic diagram, the different states (inner cycle) are presented 
by sporulation over dead necrotic malformed plant parts, infection of emerging buds 
with the propagules, conidial germination over host surface, host penetration and 
symptom development. The external factor variables (the outer cycle) include
Fig. 3.1 A schematic diagram depicting the dynamics of the malformation disease of mango 
(Pandey 2003; Chakrabarti 2011)meteorological factors (temperature, relative humidity, rain splash, dew or drizzle), 
host factors (bearing habit, time of flowering) and occurrence and population of 
mites, and insects that carry the fungal propagules and facilitate the infection by 
making injuries.

Thus, to get accurate disease prediction, the disease should be quantified at each 
and every state of the infection process. For example, if during the first state, 
i.e. during the production of conidia, the temperature and moisture are optimum 
abundant spores may be produced. But if during subsequent stages of infection 
process, for example during germination of conidia, the weather condition become 
unfavourable (increase in temperature, lowering of relative humidity and lack of dew 
deposition or drizzling), the conidia will fail to germinate. During subsequent states, 
if all the external factors are favourable the disease will not develop as the infection 
process suffered badly at the state of conidial germination. Thus, to forecast the 
epidemic accurately, the disease process should be quantified at all the states 
separately.

Criteria to Develop Forecast 4 
Attempts are usually made to develop successful and useful forecasting systems for 
diseases that have the following criteria. 
1. The disease must cause economically significant damage in terms of yield loss or 
quality. 
2. The disease should be sporadic. 
3. The disease must vary each season in the timing of the first infections and its 
subsequent rate of progress. If it does not, there is no need for forecasting. 
4. The disease incidence may vary due to genetic diversity. 
5. Growers can monitor predictions themselves or receive timely advice for apply￾ing protective measures. 
6. There are some diseases like beet yellows virus in sugar beet which causes 
considerable damage and can be accurately predicted but no effective control 
measures are known for the disease , thus for such diseases, it is pointless to develop 
forecast. Besides if control relies on the expensive application of a fungicide spray, 
then the correctly timed application of this spray, based on the prediction of disease 
outbreaks, will be important in improving the effectiveness of the treatment and in 
reducing its cost. Thus, disease management strategies must be available and at an 
economically acceptable cost. Growers must have sufficient manpower and equip￾ment to apply control measures when disease warning is given. 
The above criteria are elaborated further with examples. 
4.1 Capable of Inflicting Significant Damage 
In India, mango plants suffer from various diseases. Of which there are some 
diseases that inflict only limited parts of the plant and cause insignificant amount 
of yield loss. Some of them even do not appear in every season; thus, their

Diplodia natalensis attacks both shoots and fruits of mango, it is neither widely 
prevalent and being weak parasite nor very serious (Singh 1990). Similarly, Blossom 
blight of mango caused by Glomerella cingulata varies in severity from slight to 
heavy infection of panicles depending on the prevailing weather conditions (Singh 
1990). Hence, the development of forecasting systems which is tedious, cumber￾some and expensive process for such minor diseases does not make any sense. On 
the other hand, the disease malformation affects all the vegetative parts of the plant 
and the inflorescence. The malformation causes an average of 50% yield loss every 
year; sometimes it is as high as 80%.
18 4 Criteria to Develop Forecast
4.2 Sporadic in Nature 
The mango malformation disease is sporadic in the sense that it is highly prevalent in 
the northern states of India while occurrence in the coastal states is scattered and low. 
Even the malformation symptoms in both the region show some variations (Kumar 
et al. 1993). 
4.3 Seasonal Variation of the Disease Incidence 
The appearance of the floral malformation is greatly influenced by the prevailing 
weather conditions at the time of appearance of the floral buds (Table 4.1); thus, the 
disease varies in time of first appearance with the variation of mango cultivars even 
in the same season (Singh et al. 1979). Table 4.1 shows that with increasing 
temperature during bud burst in mango, the incidence of malformation is reduced.

4.4 Effect of Genetic Diversity of Mango Cultivars on the Disease Incidence 19
4.4 Effect of Genetic Diversity of Mango Cultivars 
on the Disease Incidence 
The genetic makeup of the cultivars influences greatly the disease incidence. Two 
genetically different cultivars under similar conditions behave differently. For 
example, the progress of the malformation and resultant disease percentages in 
both regular and alternate-bearing cultivars in the same crop seasons vary signifi￾cantly (Table 4.2). In alternate-bearing mango cultivar, e.g. Banarasi Langra the 
waxing and waning of the disease progress curve was very sharp while in regular￾bearing cultivars, e.g. Neelum it was modest (Fig. 4.1) (Kumar and Chakrabarti 
1997).

4.5 Availability of Predicting System 
An Expert System for Management of Malformation Disease of Mango 
(ESMMDM) that can predict the disease incidence and suggest appropriate 
integrated management strategy has been developed (Chakrabarti and Chakraborty 
2006). The expert system is based on the information generated from long-term 
research on the aetiology, epidemiology and management under both laboratory and 
field conditions. 
The ESMMDM is window-based, user-friendly and interactive software designed 
for the Windows platform. The user interface was developed with the questionnaire 
supported by combo boxes, radio buttons and a few text boxes. There are appropriate 
colour photographs that help the user to accurately define the problems. The 
questions were designed in simple natural language. To keep the system simple 
enough, only one question is asked at a time. However, to add flexibility to the 
software, the answers to the previous questions can be modified at any time. The 
software can be used by any person with or without any expertise in the field of 
computers. Thus, the growers can monitor predictions themselves or receive timely 
advice for applying protective measures. 
4.6 Availability of Appropriate Control Measures 
A simple IPM strategy that includes clean agricultural operations and easily avail￾able agrochemicals has been developed on the basis of long-term research both 
under laboratory and field conditions. Operational cost (including cost of chemical 
and wages of labours) per plant as estimated in 2010 was about Rs. 100/- per 
annum. By the treatment on an average of 100–300, i.e. 20–50 kg more fruits per 
plant were obtained. Thus, a profit of Rs. 250–700 per plant was accrued by using 
this technique. About 250 mango plants of 20 years old of an orchardist at the 
Sohawal mango belt in the District Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh were rendered totally 
abortive by the malformation. After adopting this technique, he was able to earn 
about 1.5 lacs per annum (Chakrabarti et al. 2009). 
Thus, all the plant disease epidemics for which the forecasting systems have been 
developed fulfil the above-mentioned criteria.

Modelling of Epidemic Dynamic 5 
In the forthcoming chapters the methods of deducing different types of regression 
equations, the construction of expert systems will be narrated step by step with 
practical examples supported by illustrations, graphs, figures, etc. But before going 
into details, an introduction to different modelling procedures seems to be helpful. 
Modelling means a hypothetical description of a complex system of the epidemic 
dynamics. The objective of modelling is to simplify the reality in order to summarize 
the process of the epidemic. In other words, effective models can simulate the 
evolution of a disease during the season. A mathematical model is an equation or 
set of equations which represents behaviour of a system. Mathematical, statistical 
and other tools have been used to construct the forecast models. The first temporal 
development model of plant disease epidemic was proposed by Van der Plank (1960, 
1963), which has been the base of many epidemiological models created so far. 
Mathematical tools are increasingly being preferred to understand the epidemic 
dynamics. A clear vision in the nature of the epidemic in turn helps to develop 
optimal forecasting and controlling mechanism. The most common mathematical 
tools used in plant disease epidemiology are: regression analysis, disease progress 
curves, area under disease progress curve and computer simulations. Nevertheless, 
there are other tools to evaluate the disease progress. An updated review about 
mathematical tools used in plant disease epidemiology is presented in the following 
chapters. An account of various Regression analysis /Growth models has been 
summarized in the Table 5.1. 
Regression analysis: Regression analysis explains how the typical value of the 
dependent variable (say disease occurrence or severity) changes when any one of the 
independent variables (say weather parameters, etc.) is varied, while the other 
independent variables are held fixed. It also suggests which among the independent 
variables are related to the dependent variable and explores the forms of these 
relationships, i.e. whether the relation is positive or negative; significant or 
non-significant. Regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting.

Regression analysis 
Linear When independent and dependent variables appear linearly 
Multiple regression 
analysis 
When there are more than one explanatory variables, then a multiple 
regression analysis is required 
Partial correlation 
coefficient 
Partial correlation analysis is to find correlation between two 
variables after removing the effects of other variables 
Stepwise regression When one has to select one independent variable among a large 
number of potential independent variables to create a ‘best’ model 
Multivarate regression It is useful for more special problems such as compound tests of 
coefficients. Analysis can be used if the relation between X and Y is 
not so linear 
Non-linear regression When prediction equation depends nonlinearly on one or more 
unknown parameters 
Growth models 
Polynomical model It shows the curved relationship between Y and X 
Logistic model (Sigmoid 
curve) 
It is appropriate for most polycyclic diseases, meaning that there is a 
secondary spread within a growing 
Gompertz model The curve reaches a maximum more quickly and declines more 
gradually than the logistic model 
Weibull model The Weibull model is suitable if there are a larger number of 
parameters and so can describe more complicated curves 
Monomolecular model Monocyclic epidemic that has only one infection cycle per season 
(they are typical of soil-borne diseases may be best modelled using 
monomolecular model 
Exponential model This growth model is appropriate when newly diseased (infected) 
individuals lead to more diseased (infected) individuals and has been 
used to model changes in disease prevalence on a geographic scale, it 
can be applied to describe the very early stages of most polycyclic 
epidemics 
Linear regression analysis: Linear regression is an approach to modelling the 
relationship between a dependent variable y and one or more explanatory (indepen 
dent) variables denoted X. In a linear model, all the parameters appear linearly. The 
case of one explanatory variable is called simple regression. A linear regression line 
has an equation of the form Y = a + bX, where X is the explanatory variable and Y is 
the dependent variable. The slope of the line is b, and a is the intercept (the value of 
y when x = 0). So, the slope tells how fast y changes when x is changed. 
Scattered diagram: Before proceeding for linear regression analysis, a scattered 
diagram (Fig. 5.1) with dependent and independent variables may be drawn. The 
scattered diagram gives the primary indication if the two variables are significantly 
correlated or not. Table 5.2) shows the percentage of malformed panicles and 
percentage of fruit set out of total number of panicles. To find out the correlations 
(if any) between these, two variables scattered diagram may be drawn. For this 
purpose, on common graph paper malformation data may be plotted on X axis while 
that of fruit set data over the Y axis. Now an intercept line may be drawn through the 
fruit set data.100

Kumar and Chakrabarti (1997) recorded that with increase in number of mal￾formed panicles the loss in yield of mango also increased. Thus, by using a single￾independent variable, X (number of malformed panicles) and one-dependent vari￾able, i.e. loss in fruit yield (y), linear regression equation was developed that could 
predict the yield loss. 
Kumar and Chakrabarti (1997) attempted to determine the relationship between 
the disease severity (percentage of malformed panicles) and the loss in yield 
(in terms of number of fruits) through linear regression analysis. The mango 
cv. Neelum would be an ideal model for this purpose. Neelum is a regular bearing 
cv and under a given set of conditions its yield does not vary much. Thus, the effect 
of severity of malformation on the yield could be easily detected. During two 
consecutive crop seasons, i.e. 1993 and 1994, the number of malformed panicles 
(X) and fruit yield (in number) (Y) were recorded. In each year, 39 replicates were 
maintained. The average number of malformed panicles and fruits in 1993 were 
48.44 and 1.50%, respectively, while the same in the next year were 14.71 and 
34.56%, respectively. Simple correlation coefficient was obtained by using theMicrosoft Excel programme. The equation obtained was Y = 48.35–0.959 X. Thus, 
the attainable yield (a) was 48.35%, but the actual yield in 1993–1994 was 36.16%. 
Therefore, the loss in yield was 12.19%. The yield declined (b) by 0.96% for every 
1% unit increase in disease severity (% malformed panicle). Kumar and Chakrabarti 
(1997) concluded that when independent variants (number of malformed panicles) 
differ significantly, the value of Y (number of fruits) corresponding to X may be 
assessed through linear regression. Thus, the extent of loss could be predicted 
accurately beforehand by counting the number of malformed panicles.

(1978) developed a linear model for predicting stem rust severity for 7 days in 
advance in which three independent variables (X), e.g. mean disease severity for the 
past week (X1), mean weekly minimum temperature (°C) expected for the next week 
(X2) and mean weekly minimum relative humidity (%) expected for the next week 
(X3) were used. 
5.1 Multiple Regression Equation 27
5.1 Multiple Regression Equation 
Y = b0 + b1X1 + b2X2 + . . .. . . + bkXk where Xi is independent variables, bi represents 
the regression coefficient (slope) and b0 denotes the intercept. This is a linear 
equation to predict the dependent variable Y that minimizes the sum of the squared 
k 2: 
Multiple regression equation can be expressed in matrix form as: 
y = Xb þ e 
and the normal equation to estimate the regression coefficient in matrix form can be 
expressed as: 
b = XT X - 1 XT Y 
Example 
Pandey (2003) determined the relationship between the number of malformed shoots 
developed on naturally infected mango plants cv. Amrapali and the different envi￾ronmental parameters viz. number of days with optimum temperature (25–30 ° C and 
RH (>85%) (X1), number of rainy days (X2) and total rainfall (X3) (Table 5.3)

The equation obtained was Y = 10.234 + 4.336X1 - 0.243X2 - 0.141X3. A unit 
change in optimum temperature and moisture (X1) influences the disease incidence 
up to an extent of 4.336 unit (b1) in positive direction. But a unit of change in rainy 
days (X2) and total rainfall (X3) influenced the disease incidence by 0.234 (b2) and 
0. 141 (b3) unit in the opposite direction. The intercept (b0 = 10.234) denotes the 
expected value of y when x = 0.

The multiple correlation coefficient is the positive square root of r-square and is 
equal to 0:699 p = 0:836. 
Similar multiple correlation coefficient with three variables can be performed to 
obtain the following: 
rX1X2X3 = 0:960;rYX2X3 = 0:237;rYX1X3 = 0:833;rYX1X2 = 0:715 
Partial correlation coefficient: Partial correlation analysis is aimed at finding the 
correlation between two variables after removing the effects of other variables. A 
partial correlation measures the strength of the linear relationship between two 
variables, while adjusting for the effect of other variables. This type of analysis 
helps to spot spurious correlations, i.e. correlations explained by the effect of other 
variables as well as to reveal hidden correlations, i.e. correlations masked by the 
effect of other variables. Partialing represents a method of exerting statistical control 
over variables. It is important to distinguish statistical control from experimental 
control (e.g. random assignment to treatments, control by constancy, etc.). Gener￾ally, experimental control provides stronger evidence than statistical control because 
it is directly managed by the researcher and planned a priori. 
Partial correlation coefficient can be obtained using the following formula:

The data presented in Table 5.3 were computed for the partial correlation 
analysis. The data show that controlling the other variables the partial correlation 
coefficients between the malformed shoots with optimum temperature and RH, 
number of rainy days and total rainfall were 0.8256, -0.134 and -0.720, respec￾tively. Thus, the two variables viz. number of days with optimum temperature and 
RH, total rains have significant correlations with the malformed shoots and may be 
used as predictors. 
Stepwise regression: A common problem in regression analysis is that of 
variable selection. Often, there are a large number of potential independent variables, 
and one has to select among them to create a ‘best’ model. One common method of 
dealing with this problem is some form of automated procedure, such as stepwise 
selection. Stepwise regression is a semi-automated process of building a model by 
successively adding or removing variables based solely on the t-statistics of their 
estimated coefficients. The program automatically enters the variable with the 
highest F-to-enter statistic or removes the variable with the lowest F-to-remove 
statistic. The stepwise approach is much faster. Stepwise methods are frequently 
employed to evaluate the order of importance of variables. 
The incidence of malformation disease of mango caused by Fusarium 
moniliforme var. subglutinans (=F. mangifera) is promoted by its mite vector, 
Tyrolichus casei while its development is adversely affected by the host defense 
chemical compound mangiferin. Chakrabarti et al. (1997) recorded the population of 
F. mangiferae, T. casei and mangiferin content in young buds and subsequently 
developed malformed panicles in mango cv Banarasi Langra (Table 5.5). Then 
correlation and regression coefficient matrix for the variables was obtained using 
M STAT-C software package. The data presented in Table 5.6 show the way the 
variables interact with each other and identify the variable(s) that influenced the 
development of malformed panicles significantly. The data presented in Table 5.5 
show that the population of F. mangiferae and T. casei were negatively correlated 
with mangiferin content and the incidence of malformed panicles. But these two 
variables were positively correlated with each other. However, mangiferin content 
and the incidence of malformed panicles were positively correlated. But mangiferinshowed positive correlation with F. mangiferae while it adversely affected the 
population of T. casei.

Multivariate regression: It is the most useful for more special problems such as 
compound tests of coefficients. For example, Pandey et al. (2003) tested to know if 
the age of mango plants has the same predictive power for incidence of floral 
malformation in a mango orchard in Lucknow as it does in the orchard situated 
nearby mango belt in Faizabad. One option would be to run two separate simple 
regressions and eyeball the results to see if the coefficients look similar. But if 
somebody wants a formal probability test of whether the relationship differs, one 
could run it instead as a multivariate regression analysis. The coefficient estimates 
will be the same, but it will enable us to directly test for their equality or other 
properties of interest. Analysis can be used if the relation between Y and X is not so 
linear. 
However, multiple linear regression differs from multivariate regression. A 
multiple regression typically refers to regression models with a single-dependent 
variable and two or more predictor variables. In multivariate regression, by contrast, 
there are multiple dependent variables and any number of predictors.5.2 The Polynomial Model 33
5.2 The Polynomial Model 
A polynomial model is in fact the extension of regression model that shows the 
curved relationship between Y and X. The second-degree polynomial is known as 
quadratic or curvilinear regression (U-shaped curve called a parabola). In such 
model, the regression line has one bend. The third-degree polynomial which is 
known as the cubic model possesses two turning (critical) points and three real 
roots (where the curve crosses the horizontal axis). With the addition of more bends 
the polynomial is known as fourth-degree (Quartic) polynomial and so on. They fita 
wide range of curvature. They show the relation of a single independent variable 
with Y. 
Polynomial equations are of the following types: 
Y = a + b1X1 Linear 
Y = a + b1X1 + b2X1 
2 Quadratic 
Y = a + b1X1 + b2X1 
2 + b3X1 
3 Cubic 
Linear = straight line, no curve or inflections 
Quadratic = one parabolic curve, no inflections 
Cubic = two parabolic rates of curvature with the possibility of an inflection 
point. 
Inflections (the inflection point is where the acceleration of the regression line 
switches from positive to negative) (Fig. 5.2) for Polynomial Regression lines. 
Each additional term allows for another change in the rate of curvature and allows 
for an additional inflection. The slopes of the regression line become less steep as 
X increases, but line does not actually begin to descend.

Fig. 5.3 Linear relation host age (X) and incidence of malformation (Y) 
For example, Pandey et al. (2003) observed that the number of malformed 
panicles (Y) increased with the increase in the age (X) of mango plants. But after a 
point of time, the number of diseased panicles started declining nevertheless the 
plant age went on increasing (Table 5.7). 
Consequently, accelerated growth of the regression line after certain time bends 
downwards. The data were fitted to a set of linear (Fig. 5.3) and polynomial equation 
of second (quadratic) (Fig. 5.4; Table 5.8) and third order (cubic) (Fig. 5.5). And 
polynomial equation of the third order (cubic) (Fig. 5.5; Table 5.9) was the best 
fitted. Thus, the relationship between host age (X) and incidence of malformation (Y) 
forms a cubic polynomial equation (Fig. 5.5). 
5.3 Validation of the Model 
Once a predictive model has been developed, it has to be thoroughly tested by 
statistically comparing its predictions with what actually happens. After developing 
such a model, if an additional value of X is then given without its accompanying 
value of y, the fitted model can be used to make a prediction of the value of y.5.3 Validation of the Model 35

5.4 Chi-square (x2 ) test 
Chi-square test (Panse and Sukhatme 1967) is used to test the validity of the model. 
The validity of the model is evaluated statistically based on the predicted (E) and 
actually observed (O) values. Chi-square (χ2 ) value is calculated by the formula: 
a = Σ (O-E)2 /E. On comparing the ‘a’ value with the tabular value at the appropriate 
degree of freedom, it is verified that if the null hypothesis is rejected and there is a 
wide difference between the predicted and observed values. If the hypothesis is 
accepted there will be no wide difference between the predicted and observed values, 
thus the validity of the model is established. 
For example, Pandey et al. (2003) reported the pattern of changes in incidence of 
floral malformation disease ( y) in mango with the plant age (X) in Faizabad and 
developed the following regression equation: Y = 17.605 + 7.775X - 0.329X2 
, 
R2 = 0.998, where Y = number of malformed panicles and X = host age. The 
observed and calculated values for floral malformation progress curves show close 
resemblance (Table 5.5). The χ2 value (0.112) also supports that the model is 
adequate to describe the progress of the floral malformation in different age groups 
of plants (Table 5.10). 
Chi-square table value at 3° of freedom and 5% level of significance = 7.81. 
Since the calculated value = 0.1125 which is less than 7.81, the model is valid. Note 
that the degree of freedom = n-1.5.7 Non-linear Regression Equation 37
5.5 Goodness of Fit 
The goodness of fit of a statistical model describes how well it fits a set of 
observations. Measures of goodness of fit typically indicate if there is any discrep￾ancy between observed values and the values expected under the model in question. 
One statistical test that gives some information about the goodness of fit of a model is 
R2 
. R-squared measures between zero and one. An R2 of 1.0 indicates that the 
regression line perfectly fits the data. Generally, a higher value of R-squared 
means that the model has the ability of a better prediction. R-Squared is most often 
used in linear regression. Values of R2 outside the range 0–1 can occur where the 
modelled values are not obtained by linear regression and depending on which 
formulation of R2 is used. Another statistical test that addresses this issue is the 
chi-square (χ2 ) goodness of fit test. 
5.6 Non-linear Regression 
The basic idea of nonlinear regression is the same as that of linear regression, 
namely, to relate a response Y to a vector of predictor variables X. Non-linear 
regression is characterized by the fact that the prediction equation depends 
nonlinearly on one or more unknown parameters. If something is growing exponen￾tially, which means growing at a steady rate, the relationship between X and Y is 
curved. To fit something like this, non-linear regression is needed. Whereas linear 
regression is often used for building a purely empirical model, non-linear regression 
usually arises when there are physical reasons for believing that the relationship 
between the response and the predictors follows a particular functional form. 
5.7 Non-linear Regression Equation 
Y = AebX 
X is often a measure of time. X goes up by 1 for each second, hour, day, year, or 
whatever time unit are used. Sometimes, X is a measure of dosage. X can be positive, 
0, or negative. 
A is the starting amount, the amount expected when X is 0. 
b is the growth rate, with continuous compounding. b is the estimate of the 
relative change in Y associated with a unit change in X. 
Y is the growth 
For example, if b is 0.05 and X increases by 1, Y is multiplied by e5 , which is 
about 1.051, so Y really increases by 5.1%. 
Let the starting amount y = 1 at x = 0 implies Y = A = 1 
At x = 1, Y = A*e
0.05*1 = 1*1.0512 = 1.0512 (e
0.05 = 1.0512) so y increased by 
5.12% in one unit change of x. 

5.8 Some Important Non-linear Growth Models 
These models describe the growth behaviour over time, i.e. evolution of a quantity 
over time. Values for the measured property are plotted on a graph as a function of 
time. In general, growth models are mechanistic in nature. Growth can be modelled 
using several mathematical functions. Growth models provide a range of curves that 
are similar to disease progress curves and represent one of the most common 
mathematical tools to temporal disease epidemiology. 
5.9 Logistic Model 
It was first proposed by Verhulst in 1838 to represent human population growth. The 
second type of logistic model was proposed by Van der Plank (1963), being more 
appropriate for most polycyclic diseases, meaning that there is a secondary spread 
within a growing season. A logistic function or logistic curve is a common sigmoid 
curve that describes population growth. In a logistic curve, growth of a population is 
modelled as ‘S-shaped’ (Fig. 5.6). The initial stage of growth is approximately 
exponential; then, as saturation begins, the growth slows, and at maturity, growth 
stops. This growth model is the most widely used for describing epidemics of plant 
disease. A generalized logistic curve is as follows: 
lt = L 
1 þ Ae - kt 
where 
l = length and t = time. 
L is the upper asymptote (maximum size reach at t → infinity).

5.9.1 Gompertz model 
This growth model is appropriate for polycyclic diseases as an alternative to logistic 
models. It has an absolute rate curve that reaches a maximum more quickly and 
declines more gradually than the logistic model. Gompertz and logistic models have 
a characteristic sigmoid form and an inflection point meaning secondary inoculation 
or plant-to-plant spread within the crop.

5.11 Monomolecular Model 43
5.10 Monomolecular Model 
The growth curve depends on the nature of the epidemic. Polycyclic epidemics that 
are caused by pathogens capable of several infection cycles a season, e.g. late blight 
of potato are usually best modelled by logistic model whereas monocyclic epidemic 
that has only one infection cycle per season (they are typical of soil-borne diseases 
such as Fusarium wilt of flax) may be best modelled using monomolecular model. 
This model is also called negative exponential model. The correct choice of model is 
essential for a disease forecasting system to be successful. 
5.11 Monomolecular Model 
dt = QR ðÞ 100- y
where Q = amount of initial inoculum, R = infection efficacy of the inoculum, 
y = disease intensity 
Downy mildew of opium poppy caused by Peronospora arborescence 
perpetuates through infected plant debris in soil. When seeds are sown in the infested 
soil, the seedlings emerge in a highly distorted form (systemic infection). Within 
fortnight, the pathogen multiplies over the systemically infected seedlings and the 
secondary disease cycle starts. Chakrabarti (unpublished) counted the systemically 
infected seedling as they started appearing and continued the recording at 3 days 
interval from 7.11.2003 to 16.11.2003 (Table 5.14). The data were plotted. The 
graph (Fig. 5.12) showed close similarity with the Monomolecular growth curve of 
monocyclic disease (Fig. 5.13) or Malthusian mode (Fig. 5.14). The model was 
successfully validated (Table 5.15). 
Equation y = y0e
kt y = 0.936 exp. (0.312*X) shows that primary infected plants 
are undergoing exponential growth and is an exponential function of time. 
Y0 = 0.936 represents the primary infected plants at 0.94% at time t = 0, and 
k = 0.312 > 0 is a constant, called the growth constant. It can be seen that at t = 4 
(12 days), primary infected plants have grown to almost four times, i.e. 3.26%.

5.12 Exponential Model 
This model is also known as the logarithmic, geometric or Malthusian model. This 
growth model is appropriate when newly diseased (infected) individuals lead to 
more diseased (infected) individuals and has been used to model changes in disease 
prevalence on a geographic scale, it can be applied to describe the very early stages 
of most polycyclic epidemics. 
Kumar and Chakrabarti (1997a) recorded the dissemination of malformation 
disease from the source plant in a mango orchard of the cv Dashehari 
(Table 5.16). Plant to plant distance was 10 m. The data were plotted and thegraph (Fig. 5.15) showed close similarities with exponential growth curve 
(Fig. 5.16).

and k = -0.06 < 0 is a constant, called the growth (negative) constant. It can be seen 
that incidence of floral malformation at 40 m away from the source plant 
(t = 40 days) has declined to 0.56%.5

5.13 Infection Rate 
van der Plank (1960) proposed two equations to calculate the rate of infection during 
the disease progress. The rates of infection (‘r’) during normal distribution trial, 
i.e. before ‘take off’ of the disease and that of during the exponential growth phase, 
i.e. ‘take off’ stage were calculated by the following formula.r I

during these periods was calculated in the following way.

5.15 Area Under Disease Progress Curve (DPC) 
Area under disease progress curve (DPC) is used to assess quantitative disease 
resistance in crop cultivars and as a descriptor for the epidemic to measure crop 
losses. It is also useful for quantitative summary of disease intensity over times, for 
comparison across years, locations and management measures. AUDPC is most 
easily and commonly measured using the trapezoidal method. The higher value of 
AUDPC indicates more susceptibility or yield loss. 
AUDPC =
XNi - 1 
i = 1 
yi þ yiþ1
 
2 tðÞ iþ1 - t1
where Y1 is disease severity and t1 is time. 
In this method, one starts with disease severity data (Y1) collected at various times 
t1. Then the average disease severity at the midpoint between each two-time points is 
calculated. After this, the average disease severity is multiplied by the length of time 
between the two points. Finally, those products across all time intervals are sum up 
to get AUDPC. 
Examples 
The number of malformed panicles of an alternate (Himsagar) and one regular 
(Neelum) 
bearing cvs during 1991–1994 were collected four times at 1 year interval 
(Table 5.19). The AUDPC of these two cvs. are presented in Tables 5.20 and 5.21. 
The incidence of downy mildew-affected (primary infection) plants was recorded 
at 3 days interval four times under field condition (Table 5.14), and its AUDPC was 
determined (Table 5.22).

The AUDPC of the cv. Himsagar was higher than that of Neelum. Hence, it may 
be concluded that Himsagar is more susceptible than the cv. Neelum. On the other 
hand, AUDPC of opium poppy against the downy mildew was the minimum. The 
mango malformation is polyetic in nature, i.e. over the times it behaves like a 
polycyclic disease. While the downy mildew of opium poppy at the initial stage 
behaves like a monocyclic disease. 
5.16 Predicted Success of a Single Spore Inoculum of Causing 
Infection 
The efficiency of an inoculum of causing infection under a new environmental 
condition is estimated following the equation of Baker (1971): 
p = 1–0:51=d , 
where p = probability that one spore will succeed in infecting, 
‘d’ = effective inoculum population causing 50% infection (EID50).ð Þ
52 5 Modelling of Epidemic Dynamic
Wastie (1962) placed spores of Botrytis fabae and B. cinerea on broad bean 
leaves at various densities and observed lesions. The value of d at ED50 for B. fabae 
was 4, and for B. cinerea was 500. Substituting in the above equation the calculated 
per cent success in single spore inoculum is 16% and 0.14%, respectively. The 
actually observed values were 13 and 0.9%, respectively. 
B:fabae p = 1 - 0:51=d = 1 - 0:51=4 = 1 - 0:8409 = 0:1591 ≈ 16% 
B:cinerea p = 1 - 0:51=d = 1 - 0:51=500 = 1 - 0:9986 = 0:00139 ≈ 0:14% 
Similarly, Chakrabarti and Kumar (1997) conducted an experiment with 
Amrapali and Mallika, two dwarf but highly malformation-susceptible hybrids of 
mango developed in New Delhi, a hot spot for the malformation disease. The 
experiment was conducted to find out if these infected plant materials on being 
introduced from N. Delhi to West Bengal, an area that is believed to have 
unfavourable weather conditions for the disease development could produce the 
disease symptoms and subsequently spread the disease to other cvs. Growing in the 
locality, i.e. the spread of malformation disease of mango from the foci (Table 5.1). 
For this, they first determined the ‘d’ value for Amrapali and Mallika. Then by 
applying the equation of Baker (1971), the ‘p’ values of Amrapali and Mallika were 
estimated. The experiment was conducted in an orchard with 81 plants of mixed cvs. 
The plants were 10–12 years old, and plant-to-plant distance was 10 m. The data 
were recorded in ‘on years’. 
The number of doublets (‘d’ values) was calculated by the following equation: 
D 50 ð Þ %infection = 1=n μ μðÞ - 1
where n = number of plants examined, 
μ = number of adjacent pairs of infected plants 
The ‘d’ values for Amrapali and Mallika were 60 and 26.92%, respectively. 
By applying the equation of Baker (1971), the ‘p’ values of Amrapali and Mallika 
were estimated 
p = 1 - 0:51=d = 1 - 0:51=60 = 1 - 0:9885 = 0:01149 ≈ 1:14% 
p = 1 - 0:51=d = 1 - 0:5 1 
26:92 = 1 - 0:9746 = 0:0254 ≈ 2:54% 
Thus, the ‘p’ values of Amrapali and Mallika were estimated as 1.14% (EID50 60) 
and 2.54% (EID50 26.92), respectively.5.17 Doublet Analysis (for Determining ‘d’ Value) (van der Plank 1960) 53
5.17 Doublet Analysis (for Determining ‘d’ Value) (van der 
Plank 1960) 
In doublet analysis, the observed number of adjacent pairs of infected plants is 
compared with a value expected if infections occurred at random, or from outside 
sources. Numbers of adjacent pairs are greater than this value if infections have 
spread from foci within the field. Differences are greater at lower levels of infection 
and decrease with increasing disease level (Table 5.23). 
To find out if there was a spread of the infection from the source plant van der 
Plant (1960) suggested ‘doublet’ test. In doublet analysis, the observed number of 
adjacent pairs of infected plants is compared with a value expected if infections 
occurred at random, or from outside sources. Numbers of adjacent pairs are greater 
than this value if infections have spread from foci within the field. Differences are 
greater at lower levels of infection and decrease with increasing disease level. 
Chakrabarti and Kumar (1997) conducted an experiment to find out the spread of 
malformation disease of mango from the foci (Table 5.23). The experiment was 
conducted in an orchard with 81 plants of mixed cvs. The plants were 10–12 years 
old, and plant-to-plant distance was 10 meters. The data were recorded in ‘on years’. 
Number of observed and calculated adjacent pairs of infected (doublet) plants during 
the years 1991, 1993 and 1995 are presented in Figs. 5.19, 5.20 and 5.21, respec￾tively and in Table 5.23. 
The expected number of doublets was calculated by the following equation: 
d = 1/n μ (μ - 1) where n = number of plants examined, μ = number of adjacent 
pairs of infected plants 
The results presented in Table 5.23 show that the number of observed doublets in 
all the 3 years were greater than the number of expected (calculated) doublet. 
Further, the observed doublet in 1991, 1993 and 1995 was more than the expected 
doublet by 125, 90 and 81 times. Thus, with increased disease incidence the 
difference between ‘O’ and ‘C’ decreased. Hence, the results fulfilled Van der 
Plank’s equation for doublet analysis. Therefore, it may be concluded that the 
disease was spread from the source plant.

For this purpose, a graph was drawn say in between incubation period and conidia 
production in a fixed temperature (Table 5.24). A line perpendicular to the X axis at 
the peak point of Y axis is to be drawn touching the cubic curve at its maximum 
height (Fig. 5.22a). From the point of intercept, another line perpendicular to the 
Y axis is drawn over the X axis. From this maximum level of disease incidence, 
corresponding optimum incubation period can be determined (Fig. 5.22a, b). From 
the quadratic curve, optimum incubation period (H) for maximum conidia produc￾tion (M) was estimated as 74.31 h (Fig. 5.22b).56 5 Modelling of Epidemic Dynamic

Decision Support Systems (DSSs) 6 
A decision support system (DSS) is usually defined as “an interactive computer￾based system that helps decision makers utilizes data and models to solve unstruc￾tured problems under complex and uncertain condition” (Shtienberg 2013). 
DSSs like a human expert can successfully address specific problems in well￾defined areas with the ease of logic and problem-solving proficiency of an expert and 
can express clearly the knowledge that is required. In fact, DSSs have applied 
management tools that explain complex information to help the users to derive 
decisions. DSSs can be made up of a single component, such as a spreadsheet 
(e.g., Excel), a database (the file in which data can be stored), a geographic 
information system (GIS) (location specific), a simulation model, or a decision 
rule, or a more complex combination of these components (Knight 1997). The 
ideal DSS is expected to be elegant, easy-to-use software on a computer readily 
accessible to a manager to provide interactive assistance in the manager’s decision 
process. 
DSS consists of three major components or basic subsystems, i.e., dialog, data, 
and models (Ford 1985). The decision models perform the central tasks of the 
decision-making process and are at the core of the DSS. In general, they are used 
for the prediction of the outcome of the decision choice. The decision models help 
the decision makers to rank a set of decision alternatives and choose the best one 
according to their preferences. All the capabilities of the DSS must be articulated and 
implemented dialog subsystem. The data sub-system maintains, stores, and retrieves 
data from the database, extracts data from various sources, etc. The model subsystem 
contains the library of models and routines to maintain and manage them. These are 
interfaced with the dialog subsystem through which the user has control over the 
operation, manipulation, and use of the models. 
The success of a DSS may depend on several factors like availability of help for 
users’ problems, infrastructure to provide software updates, and structured educa￾tional programs to teach users the necessary computer and software skills. DSSs may 
be used by extension agents, consultants, or other agricultural personnel that carry

https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-1210-0_6out decision-making activities related to the management of plant diseases. For 
improving integrated pest management (IPM), DSSs can contribute significantly.
60 6 Decision Support Systems (DSSs)
In view of the advantages of DSSs and the potential benefits from their use, 
hundreds of agricultural DSSs have been developed over the years and are readily 
available and affordable. For example, on the Euroblight website (a potato late blight 
network for Europe), a list of 12 DSSs is presented, all for the management of one 
pathogen, Phytophthora infestans (http://www.euroblight.net/EuroBlight.asp). 
Some of these systems were developed by scientists working at academic or 
governmental research institutions, and these DSSs are in the public domain. 
Other systems have been developed in the private sectors and are marketed by 
commercial companies. 
The rate of use of DSSs for plant protection by farm managers on a day-to-day 
basis is variable. In the 1980s and 1990s, it was recorded that although several DSSs 
had been widely implemented, most farm managers had not adopted DSSs as part of 
their IPM programs. For systems that are considered successful, adoption rates can 
still be close to or less than 50%. Recent publications suggest that implementation 
rates have not increased over the years and that the rate of DSS adoption in the 2000s 
was poor as well. The acceptance of any new technology by a potential user, such as 
a DSS by a farm manager, is affected by technical, professional, economical, social, 
and psychological factors (Shtienberg 2013). 
6.1 Reasons for the Low Rate of Implementation 
of Decision-Support Systems for Plant Protection 
One of the reasons for the low rate of adaptation of DSSs is ascribed to the 
constraints in experience of the developers of the systems (in most cases agricultural 
researchers working in academic settings) in developing software from inception to 
marketing and commercial implementation. Sometimes it may be due to the intrinsic 
deficiency of the software such as imprecise methods for spatial interpolation of the 
observed and forecasted data, translation of the data into environmental inputs 
needed for pest or disease models, and difficulty in accurately estimating disease 
risk in some patho-systems. Sometimes the users are unable to make use of DSS due 
to a lack of access to computers and the willingness to invest the time needed for 
collecting the data (e.g., weekly visit to the field) required to run the systems. The 
likelihood of adoption of DSSs by farm managers is highly correlated with the 
financial advantage that this strategy can offer over conventional crop-protection 
strategies. The relatively low cost of some fungicides, the availability of extension 
agents, and the perceived high cost of some DSSs also discourage farm managers 
from adopting this technology. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organiza￾tion suggested that the adoption of an innovation is unlikely unless it offers a 2:1 or 
greater financial advantage over existing practices. Psychologically users are usually 
against advice generated and presented by a machine. Many DSSs were designed to 
serve functions deemed important by management scientists and were poorly 
adapted to the questions and needs of farm managers. Hence, managers whileusing DSSs no longer receive other benefits that are gained from contact with 
extension agents. The DSSs that have been developed are not always been relevant 
to fulfill different expectations of the farm managers. 
6.2 Effects of the Nature of the Cropping System on Managers’ Decisions 61
6.2 Effects of the Nature of the Cropping System on Managers’ 
Decisions 
6.2.1 Decision-Support Systems for Extensive Crops 
Wheat covers the largest area of cultivated land in Israel. Wheat is considered an 
extensive crop as the value of the annual harvest per hectare is a few thousand 
dollars. The prevalence and severity and intensity of foliar diseases fluctuate not only 
between years but also between fields on the same farm. Under these conditions, the 
economic benefits of chemical control are erratic and sometimes marginal. In view of 
the low value of the yield per hectare, unnecessary management actions may result in 
negative profits, so wheat fields in Israel were seldom sprayed against foliar diseases. 
A DSS called wheat disease control advisory (WDCA) was developed in 1984 
(Shtienberg 2013). It provided recommendations for the management of the impor￾tant wheat diseases in Israel and also helped in identifying situations in which 
spraying would be cost-effective by avoiding unnecessary management actions. 
WDCA is an example of a DSS developed for an extensive crop. In such crops, 
managers usually do not intend to implement any control measures. But if the 
developed systems are successful, they improve disease suppression by identifying 
the situations making it profitable, then they do not hesitate to carry out a manage￾ment action. This results in an increased number of management actions in compari￾son with the common management practice. Farm managers of extensive crops 
adopt and use DSSs and decision rules developed for the management of crop 
disease. They do so because these systems and decision rules enable them to reduce 
the risk of performing a false-positive action. 
6.2.2 Decision Support Systems for Intensive Crops 
Tomato is one of the main vegetable crops in Israel. Gray mold (caused by Botrytis 
cinerea) heavily damaged the crop yield in Israel and other Mediterranean countries. 
A DSS named BOTMAN (Botrytis Manager) was developed in 1995 (Shtienberg 
and Elad 1997). DSS was to identify the periods during which weather conditions 
were unfavorable for the pathogen so that extra spray could be avoided. BOTMAN 
integrated biological and chemical measures. The experience with BOTMAN and 
with DSSs and decision rules developed for the control of early and late blight of 
potato (caused by Alternaria solani and Phytophthora infestans, respectively), 
cucumber gray mold (caused by B. cinerea), powdery mildew in sweet pepper 
(caused by Leveillula taurica), Alternaria leaf spot in carrot (caused by Alternaria 
dauci), and powdery mildew in grapevine (caused by Uncinula necator) suggeststhat managers of intensive crops avoid adopting and are not using DSSs and decision 
rules developed for the management of plant diseases despite the fact that these 
systems can enable them to reduce the risk (Shtienberg and Yaniv 1999). One of the 
reasons for their avoidance of DSSs lies in the way that they perceive risk. 
MacKenzie (1981) reported the reason why potato growers in the United States 
did not use BLITECAST, a forecast system for the management of late blight. 
MacKenzie (1981) quoted a common response of a potato grower (an intensive 
crop) who said, “why should I risk several thousand dollars to save perhaps a few 
dozen by skipping one or two fungicide applications? I spray once a week so I can 
sleep at night!” (MacKenzie 1981). Farm managers of intensive and highly intensive 
crops in Israel have avoided adopting and are not using DSSs or decision rules 
developed for the management of crop diseases despite the fact that these systems 
would allow them to reduce the risk. They do not use these systems because the 
consequences of performing a false-negative action (uncontrolled disease outbreaks 
and substantial yield losses) markedly exceed the presumed advantages of using 
these systems (saving the cost of a few sprays). 
62 6 Decision Support Systems (DSSs)
Today, farm managers have to not only consider the problem of how to suppress 
disease but must also be aware of health and safety effects and the need to comply 
with laws concerning food safety and the environment. Restrictive laws regarding 
the use of fungicides and bactericides impose a new risk for growers: the risk that 
their product will be barred from the market if it is found to violate the new safety 
rules. If this happens, they will lose not just a portion of the crop (as occasionally 
happens when uncontrolled epidemics develop), but their entire harvest. The 
consequences may be devastating. This, for example, happened in 2006 when 
residues of isofenphosmethyl were identified in peppers that were exported from 
Almeria, Spain, to Germany. This finding resulted in the temporary halt of the export 
of Spanish peppers and Spanish growers were severely affected. As a consequence, 
in the following years, IPM strategies were adopted by the majority of pepper 
growers in Almeria. This new risk forces managers of intensive and highly intensive 
crops to modify their disease management strategies. Whereas applying fungicides 
on a weekly basis as insurance was the norm, they now must ponder how excessive 
sprays can be avoided. This can be achieved only by implementing IPM strategies 
formulated according to decision rules. 
6.3 Case Study 
6.3.1 DSS Based on Several Variables 
Debeliok et al. (2019) developed a DSS for i) assessing the performance of five soil 
functions under specific management practices, environmental/climatic conditions, 
and soil characteristics; also, for ii) choosing appropriate management practices that 
will improve the performance of the soil functions under given environmental/ 
climatic conditions and soil characteristics.6.3 Case Study 63
6.3.1.1 Methodology for Construction of Decision Models 
As they were dealing with a multi-criteria decision problem, multi-criteria decision 
models (MCDM) for the analysis of our decision problem were used. The approach 
was based on the application of analytical hierarchical processes for building 
decision models. Following this approach, a complex decision problem is 
decomposed into less complex subproblems represented by attributes structured 
into a hierarchy, where hierarchical levels are linked by integrative functions. 
To build qualitative MCDM, the DEX (Decision Expert) integrative methodol￾ogy, which combines the approach of hierarchical MCDM with rule-based expert 
systems and fuzzy sets was used. DEX is able to handle missing or non-exact data 
using probabilistic or fuzzy distribution of attributes’ values. DEX enables the 
acquisition and the representation of decision knowledge, as well as the evaluation 
and analysis of decision alternatives. DEX is based on attributes with a finite set of 
nominal values. The integrative functions (integration rules) in DEX are represented 
with if–then rules. These rules are a tabular representation of a mapping from lower￾level to higher-level attributes. The DEX methodology enables the construction of 
transparent and comprehensive models, and it provides mechanisms for presenting 
aggregation rules in a user-friendly way, i.e., in the form of decision trees. 
6.3.2 DSS Based on the Most Influential Variable 
But many (Milne et al. 2003) preferred the simplicity of crop simulation models 
designed to improve management by minimizing the number of “disposable 
parameters” in crop growth models used to predict the effects of disease. But 
simplicity is difficult to reconcile with the need to incorporate a realistic representa￾tion of the crop. Hence, simplicity requires a tight focus on those processes of crop 
development and growth that are most influential in determining: (i) epidemic 
development, (ii) fungicide efficacy, and (iii) the impact of disease on yield. 
The simplicity of coupled models cannot be reconciled with the inclusion of all 
the crop parameters which might be affected by the disease. These crop parameter 
“coupling points” represent the mechanisms by which the disease and crop might 
interact. Boote et al. (1983) and Rickman and Klepper (1991) defined many such 
mechanisms, rangiSimplicity of coupled models cannot be reconciled with inclusion 
of all the crop parameters which might be affected by the disease. These crop 
parameter “coupling points” represent the mechanisms by which the disease and 
crop might interact. 
Milne et al. (2003), based on the principles described above, described the 
development, calibration, and validation of a model of wheat canopy growth, as 
the first component of a coupled model for use in disease management decision 
support. Because wheat canopy development and growth are influential in determin￾ing the development of epidemics of foliar pathogens, the efficacy of foliar applied 
fungicides and the impact of disease on yield; specifically, the emergence, expan￾sion, and senescence of upper culm leaves in relation to anthesis date. 
In their model, they employed only the three following components:64 6 Decision Support Systems (DSSs)
(i) Leaf growth: The green area of a single leaf is a function of thermal time (Kirby 
et al. 1994) and is described by a logistic growth function followed by an 
exponential senescence function to represent the observed changes in leaf area 
(Bryson et al. 1997). 
(ii) The phyllochron: The phyllochron is the accumulated thermal time (°C days) 
between the emergence of consecutive leaves, where leaf emergence is defined 
as the time at which the leaf ligule is visible. 
(iii) Leaf initiation. 
6.4 Model Data Fitting 
Data from three sets of experiments were used to estimate parameter values. All 
statistical analyses were performed using “Genstat.” Where appropriate, residuals 
were checked and found to have acceptably uniform variance. 
Similarly, Pandey et al. (2003) developed a simple DSS based on a statistical 
model to express mathematically the pattern of changes in the incidence of floral 
malformation (disease incidence) with time (host age in years); estimating its 
parameters from a set of experimental data (Table 5.4). 
In the model subsystem, the resulting functions, as mentioned in the above data 
subsystem, were incorporated into a quadratic (Y = a + bx + ex2 + e) equation which 
was solved numerically to obtain modeled disease progress curve. Based on the 
results of regression analysis, a prediction equation was developed: 
Y = 17.605 + 7.7754 - 0.3294X2 , whereas R2 = 0.998, Y = number of malformed 
panicles, X = host age. Using the polynomial model optimum level of host age at 
which the incidence of floral malformation was maximum, Dashehai was found to be 
11.29 years when the floral malformation reached the peak (26.47%). The model 
was validated by chi-square (χ2 ) test. The observed and calculated values for floral 
malformation showed close resemblance. The χ2 value (0.112) also supports that the 
model is adequate to describe the progress of the floral malformation in different age 
groups of plants (Table 5.5). 
This is a simple example of DSS with a single parameter. With the help of this 
DSS farm, managers may determine if the plants have entered the most disease￾susceptible phase; accordingly, can adopt the management measures.

Expert System 7 
In dealing with recurring disease incidence or epidemics, farmers initially necessitate 
to useful advices for diagnosing the various pest or diseases confronted before being 
able to implement a suitable treatment or control of the affected crop. However, most 
common farmers still lack the convenience of receiving useful consultation from 
experts due to a few different constraints and with certain cases, an expert may not be 
readily available to carry out the diagnosis. A new branch of computer science 
developed in the 1970s exhibited some form of intelligence and it was named as 
artificial intelligence (AI). Therefore, the use of information and communication 
technologies (ICT) such as AI can be rendered as an effective tool to treat a certain 
problem of a specialized area as an expert would do by emulating human 
intelligence. 
During the late 1980s, in artificial intelligence, a software product appeared that 
can manipulate knowledge and was called expert system (ES). It is designed to solve 
complex problems, like an expert, by reasoning about knowledge. Expert systems 
can be referred as a computer program that is capable of acting in accordance with a 
human reasoning process, giving similar advices and making similar decisions 
parallel to what a human expertise might achieve. Expert systems can become 
beneficial assistants to human decision-makers, capable in the gathering of vast 
numbers of information and experience from multiple human experts of numerous 
discipline, and providing valuable recommendations to users. Ultimately, an expert 
system has the advantage of speeding up pest and disease diagnosis. In general, an 
expert system contains two major components, namely, the knowledge base and the 
inference engine. The knowledge base contains the body of knowledge, rules of 
decisions, and experience about a particular problem, while the inference engine 
interprets the rules of the knowledge base biological deductions and manipulations 
(Fig. 7.1). The system is designed to answer questions typed at a keyboard to a 
computer on such diverse topics as pest control, including the need to spray, 
selection of a chemical to spray, mixing and application, and weather damage 
recovery, such as freeze, frost, or drought. Based on an interview with the grower

Fig. 7.1 Expert system framework 
The first complete expert system, DENDRAL, was developed at Stanford Uni￾versity in the late 1960s. This system was developed to determine the structure of 
chemical compounds given a specification of the compound’s constituent elements 
and mass spectroscope (MS) data (Berk 1985). Stanford University, shortly after 
completing DENDRAL, began to develop “MYCIN.” MYCIN is an expert system 
that diagnoses infectious blood diseases and determines a recommended list of 
therapies for the patient (Shortliffe and Buchanan 1975). Its performance improved 
significantly over several years as additional knowledge was added. The initial 
MYCIN knowledge base had only 200 rules. This number was gradually increased 
to more than 600 rules by the early 1980s. One of the first expert systems developed 
in plant pathology was to diagnose soybean diseases (Michalski et al. 1983). In 
1985, Roach et al. developed Program Ocean Multidisciplinaire Meso Echelle 
(POMME) to advise growers about when and what to spray on their apples to 
avoid infestations. Next crop management expert system (COMAX) was developed 
for cotton which can predict crop growth and yield in response to external weather 
variables, soil parameters, and pest damage (Lemmon 1986). In India, an intelligent 
front-end for selecting evapotranspiration estimation methods (Mohan and 
Arumugam 1995) has been developed that calculates the evapotranspiration factor.7.1 Expert System Frame Work 69
7.1 Expert System Frame Work 
A schematic diagram of the Expert System Frame Work has been presented in 
Fig. 7.1. It includes the methodologies for acquiring the knowledge, organizing, 
analyzing, classifying, and structuring the acquired knowledge, representing, 
verifying, and validating the structured knowledge. A knowledge base contains an 
assortment of knowledge concerning a problem domain. The process of constructing 
knowledge base for a specific domain for use in ES is called knowledge engineering. 
The knowledge can include facts, information, and rules of judgment. An inference 
mechanism, which is also known as inference engine, control structure, or reasoning 
mechanism, is used to manipulate the stored knowledge. Manipulation of this stored 
knowledge produces the solution or suggestion to a problem. Meanwhile, a user 
interface is aimed at handling communications between end user and expert system 
(Pham and Pham 1988). Further, knowledge acquisition is required to assist the 
development of knowledge base. Nonetheless, only three basic components were 
instead used to develop this proposed framework which are knowledge base, 
inference mechanism, and user interface, whereas the component of knowledge 
acquisition was embedded as part of the knowledge base (Fig. 7.1). 
7.1.1 Knowledge Acquisition 
The acquisition of knowledge can be carried out from domain expert and by gaining 
the useful knowledge from the standard references (Kolhe et al. 2013). Also, relevant 
information is gathered from literature, pathological experimental field trials, disease 
compendiums, books, scientific papers, disease bulletins, and photographs 
concerning the diseases and by interviewing plant pathologists (Fig. 7.1). There 
are a few methods that can be employed when conducting the knowledge acquisition 
process which includes obtaining knowledge from end users, the experts themselves 
and textual information sources. An expert system is intended to process knowledge 
where the knowledge can be achieved from a variety of sources viz. books, journals, 
reports, case studies, and knowledge from human expertise. 
7.1.2 Knowledge Structuring 
The knowledge acquired from domain experts needs to be structured properly. For 
this, it is organized, analyzed, and classified to form proper knowledge structures. 
After acquiring the required knowledge, the knowledge will be structured and later 
used for the construction of knowledge base. The knowledge base comprises of 
knowledge concerning crop pest and disease, and the suitable treatment or control 
that can be implemented for a selected crop. This knowledge is stored in the form of 
textual base. An additional base, via the use of pictures and images relating to the 
pest and disease or known as pictorial base, can also be considered as part of the 
knowledge base. The pictorial base is aimed to assist the identification of the pest anddisease affected on the selected crop (Gonzalez-Andujar 2009). However, this 
additional feature of the pictorial base is much dependent on the knowledge acquisi￾tion that was able to be obtained.

The knowledge possessed by human experts is generally unstructured and not 
precisely and clearly expressed. The knowledge acquired from domain experts needs 
to be structured properly. For this, it is organized, analyzed, and classified to form 
proper knowledge structures. Harmon and King (1985) modeled the structure and 
organization of the knowledge in the form of object-attribute-value (O-A-V) knowl￾edge triplets (Table 7.1). This method was successfully used earlier in an ES for 
tomato diseases. This method can easily fit into any rule-based ES development tool. 
The condition of a rule in this method is represented as a simple sentence that is 
either true or false, or an O-A-V triplet. For example, Harmon and King (1985) 
represented the symptoms for Charcoal Rot diseases in soybean on well-grown plant 
stage in the O-A-V form as depicted in Table 7.1. The conditions of each rule are 
connected with other rule by And (conjunction), Or (disjunction), material implica￾tion, and negation. The keywords viz. rule, IF, THEN, AND, OR, etc. are defined by 
the user. With this provision, the user can write his own knowledge base in his own 
language. 
If CF (Confidence Factor) = 1 then “Definite,” 0.8 < CF < 1 then “Almost 
certain,” 0.6 < CF <= 0.8 then “Probably,” 0.3 < CF <= 0.6 then “Slight 
evidence,” 0 < CF <= 0.3 then “Ignored.” 
7.1.3 Knowledge Representation 
It involves the translation of domain-specific knowledge in the standard symbolic 
form for representing facts and rules in a computer. A rule consists of an IF part and a 
THEN part (also called a condition and an action). The IF part lists a set of 
conditions in some logical combination. The piece of knowledge represented by 
the production rule is relevant to the line of reasoning being developed if the IF partof the rule is satisfied; consequently, the THEN part can be concluded, or its 
problem-solving action taken. In rule-based representation, the representation is 
made in the format of IF–Then statement (Fig. 7.1). 
7.1 Expert System Frame Work 71
7.1.4 Inference Engine 
Another component of the expert system is the inference engine. An effective design 
for the inference engine is anticipated since it will be performing in the complex task 
of producing a proper reasoning during diagnosis and in the search of a suitable 
treatment or control as an alternative solution to overcome matters of pest and 
disease on a selected crop. Two modes of reasoning that use the rule based are: 
forward chaining and backward chaining (Fig. 7.1). Both of these reasoning can be 
used in the diagnosis of crop pest and disease. The forward chaining mode is suitable 
for use when an expert system requires several inputs from a user. Following the 
inputs given, the system will attempt to generate the result. However, the backward 
chaining mode begins from the main goal. For example, the proposed expert system 
already has the target disease (main goal) and then requires a set of rules to prove 
whether the target disease exists or not. This mode of reasoning is suggested for use 
in an expert system as it can concern in the diagnosis of one disease or one pest of a 
selected crop. Furthermore, in certain cases, the diagnostic knowledge can be vague 
and incomplete and gravitate into some degree of uncertainty (Dubey et al. 2014). 
Thus, this proposed framework suggests the use of fuzzy expert system (Table 7.3) 
to represent and compensate for the incomplete information in the inference engine 
while explaining the need to combine rule based with fuzzy expert system. More￾over, a working memory (Chen et al. 2008) is to be included as part of the inference 
engine in this proposed framework. The working memory will function to store the 
inputs from a user as soon as the user starts the use of the expert system. The input 
from the user is used afterward for the reasoning processes in the inference engine. 
7.1.5 User Interface 
The user interface component serves as an important medium of interaction between 
users and the expert system. Designing of the user interface, usually Web or mobile 
based (Fig. 5.18), is a crucial concern to many expert system researchers (Devraj and 
Jain 2011). The interface should be user friendly and follows the principle of 
“minimum works” (Jones et al. 1993). A user-friendliness approach for the user 
interface design is recommended and should be considered in developing an usable 
expert system that is easily accessed by end users.72 7 Expert System
7.2 Methodology 
7.2.1 Diversity of Methodologies Used in Previous Works 
Chen et al. (2008) listed different methodologies with their brief description used in 
the expert system (Table 7.2). 
The objectives of the different methodologies are tabulated in Table 7.3. 
The definition between a knowledge-based system (Table 7.3) and rule-based 
system cannot literally be explained since knowledge-based system also requires the 
IF–THEN rules to produce results and moreover these IF–THEN rules have mainly 
been used in the rule-based system. Additionally, knowledge-based system is 
assumed to be an extension concept derived from the rule-based system where the

Fuzzy expert system (Table 7.3) also has the IF-THEN rules, but nonetheless it is 
able to handle vagueness and imprecise information or data. Fuzzy expert system 
uses fuzzy set membership where it has to attain values between 0 and 1. The 
challenges in applying the fuzzy expert system are in the determination of a good 
membership function. A hybrid expert system using rule-based, knowledge-based, 
and fuzzy expert systems are potentially recommended during the development of an 
expert system for crop pest and disease management area (Table 7.3). 
7.3 Case Study 
To create the knowledge rules for the Charcoal Rot (Kolhe et al. 2013) in the “master 
entry‟ menu option using the “object entry‟ option, the objects viz. plant, soil 
temperature, soil moisture, reddish-brown discoloration, light gray or silvery, minute 
black sclerotia, atmospheric temperature, relative humidity, etc. are entered 
(Table 7.1). Using the “attribute” option the attributes for the rules viz. shows, is, 
appear on, discoloration of, surrounded by, coalesce to, and become, are entered 
using the small form “Attribute-entry” (Table 7.1). Similarly, values (wilting, high, 
low, lower stem, epidermal tissue, pale-green halo, etc.), Confidence factor CF (0.1, 
0.2 ...0.9, 1) (Table 7.1), Keywords (AND, OR, NIL, etc.), Crop age (30, 60, 
90, 120), and part affected (plant, stem, leaves, pod, root, etc.) are entered using 
the options provided for it in the web-form. When the system is ready with the basic 
facts for the creation of knowledge rules, the expert starts the creation of the rules by 
using the option “Disease rule” (Table 7.3 and as described in the following chapter) 
that gives the rule entry form. One by one all the rule conditions are entered by 
selecting appropriate values for objects, attributes, values, etc. for a particular 
disease using this form and the existing rules conditions of the disease are also 
displayed for the convenience of the expert and to avoid the duplicate entries. 
Similarly, different online forms are provided for editing of the already existing 
rules conditions to make any modifications if required. This ultimately helps in the 
creation and edition of rules (as mentioned in the examples below). The other 
important disease-related information such as pathogen, distribution, economic 
impact, favorable climatic conditions, life-cycle of the pathogen, management 
practices, and laboratory test for the disease/pathogen confirmation is managed by 
using the menu option “Disease Detail.” Thus, the knowledge management system 
(KMS) provides a very user-friendly interface to view, add, edit, and delete any kind 
of disease knowledge for its proper maintenance. 
7.4 Disease Identification 
R25: IF plant shows wilting AND soil temperature is high AND soil moisture is low 
THEN Ignore charcoal rot (0.2). 
R26: IF plant shows wilting THEN slight evidence of charcoal rot (0.4).7.6 Knowledge Verification and Validation 75
R27: IF reddish brown discoloration appears on lower stem, THEN slight evi￾dence of charcoal rot (0.6). 
R30: IF part affected = “lower stem” AND light gray or silvery discoloration of 
epidermal tissues. AND light gray or silvery discoloration of sub-epidermal tissue 
AND light gray or silvery discoloration of internal tissue THEN probably disease is 
charcoal rot (0.8). 
R31: IF part affected = “upper tap root” AND light gray or silvery discoloration 
of epidermal tissue AND light gray or silvery discoloration of sub-epidermal tissue 
AND light gray or silvery discoloration of internal tissue THEN probably disease is 
charcoal rot (0.8). 
R33: IF part affected = “lower stem” AND minute black sclerotia appear on 
cortical tissue AND minute black sclerotia appear on pith region THEN definitely 
disease is charcoal rot (1). 
7.5 Correlation Between Disease and Environmental Variables 
R275: IF atmospheric temperature is moderately high AND relative humidity is high 
THEN Ignore bacterial pustule (0.2). 
R277: IF minute, pale green, elevated spots appear on leaves AND minute, pale 
green, elevated spots appear on interveinal areas on both sides of leaves THEN 
probably disease is bacterial pustule (0.8). 
R281: IF small, raised, light gray to yellowish pustules surrounded by pale-green 
halo AND small, raised, light gray to yellowish pustules appear on center of spots 
AND small, raised, light gray to yellowish pustules coalesce to large spots THEN 
probably disease is bacterial pustule (0.8). 
R282: IF leaves become ragged THEN slight evidence of bacterial pustule (0.4). 
Data in the parenthesis are Confidence Factor (CF). 
7.6 Knowledge Verification and Validation 
This is the stage whereby quality assurance of the acquired knowledge is tested. The 
knowledge is verified and validated by running test cases until its quality is accept￾able. The verification process ensures that the knowledge in the system is consistent, 
complete, and correct according to the required specification (Leary and Keefe, 
1989). This is satisfied by running the knowledge management system (KMS) 
using some test cases of a few diseases.76 7 Expert System
7.7 KMS (Knowledge Management System) for Crop Diseases 
Management: A User Interface Design 
7.7.1 Software Requirements 
KMS was developed by using Microsoft .NET. It is a software development 
platform based on virtual machine-based architecture. Dot net is designed from the 
scratch to support programming language-independent application development. 
The entire .NET programs are independent of any particular operating system and 
physical hardware machine. They can run on any physical machine, running any 
operating system that contains the implementation of .NET Framework. The .NET 
framework is a collection of all the tools and utilities required to execute the .NET 
managed applications on a particular platform. The MS.NET framework includes the 
standard compilers C#, VB.NET, J#, C++ .NET, and Jscript.NET. ASP.NET is a 
web application framework and VB.NET is a windows application framework 
provided in the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Mathew 2005). ASP .NET and C# 
for the development of the system were used. 
7.7.2 System Functionality and Structure 
The user can login to the ES for a specific crop into the textbox provided for this 
purpose on this page (Turban et al. 2003). The user has three main menu options: 
master entry, disease rule, and disease detail. When selecting the option “master 
entry,” the system displays a list of entry tasks by using which the domain expert can 
enter disease type, objects, attributes, values, confidence factor, keyword, crop age, 
and part affected that is to be used for creating and editing disease rules by choosing 
an appropriate sub-menu option provided in the main menu option, “disease rule.” 
The disease detail option is used to enter the disease name, disease information, and 
disease picture. The disease information includes knowledge on other useful disease￾related aspects such as pathogen, distribution, economic impact, favorable climatic 
conditions, life-cycle of the pathogen, management practices, and laboratory tests for 
the disease/pathogen confirmation. The disease images assist the user in comparing 
the case evaluated with the identification result thus leading to the final confirmation 
of the diagnosed disease. 
7.8 Expert System for Management of Malformation Disease 
of Mango 
Malformation disease caused by F. mangiferae of mango (Mangifera indica L) is 
known as a plant disease of international importance. In every passing year, the 
disease is being reported from a new area where the disease hitherto was unknown. 
In India, the disease is highly prevalent in the northern states where it has been 
reported to cause an average annual loss of 50% (Chakrabarti, 2011). Sometimes it isas high as 80% and even more. The states at the coastal region earlier were reported 
to be free from the disease. But in the meanwhile, the pathogen with planting 
materials has been introduced into these so far unaffected areas and has established 
itself and now spreading fast among local cultivars. Mango occupies an important 
place in the economy of the vast state of Uttar Pradesh. The disease is causing havoc 
every year in several mango belts of Uttar Pradesh. The epidemic has led to many 
farmers’ violent agitation and incurred animated debates in the state assembly, also 
in the Indian parliament. Finally, at the behest of the state government and being 
sponsored by the World Bank, the scientists of N. D. University of Agriculture and 
Technology, Faizabad attempted to develop an Expert System that will forewarn the 
disease outbreak in different parts of the country, helps the growers to identify the 
disease and finally will assist the growers to decide the right type of IPM strategy to 
protect their crop beforehand. The components and architecture of the ES (Expert 
System for Management of Malformation Disease of Mango, ESMMDM) 
(Chakrabarti and Chakraborty, 2006) are being discussed here. 
7.9 Architecture 77
7.9 Architecture 
The ES is knowledge based, interactive, i.e., the inference engine accepts user inputs 
and responses to questions through input–output (I/O) interface (Fig. 7.2), much of 
the knowledge is heuristic in nature rather than algorithmic. The knowledge base 
was further supplemented with a pictorial base, i.e., use of pictures and images 
relating to the disease to assist the identification of the disease affecting the selected 
crop. It is user friendly, i.e., its language could be easily understood by the end users 
and finally a note sheet containing the answers from the user and the recommenda￾tion is made available.

7.9.1 Knowledge Acquisition 
The knowledge acquisition is considered important to increase the reliability of an 
expert system because with a good quality of knowledge in the knowledge base, an 
expert system would be capable of producing high-quality solutions. The methods 
that are usually employed in knowledge acquisition process include obtaining 
knowledge from the experts themselves, end users, and textual information sources. 
In the case of mango malformation, first of all the parameters of the host, 
pathogen, and environmental factors that influence the survival of the pathogen 
and development of the disease were identified (Chakrabarti and Kumar, 2000; 
Chakrabarti et al. 2009). The important variables that were selected for further 
studies and rationale behind the selection are as follows. 
Types of cultivars: It is well known that the disease reaction of different cultivars of 
mango varies greatly (Gaur and Chakrabarti, 2009; Kumar et al. 1993). 
Age of the host: Mango plants are known to remain highly susceptible condition 
during 5–15 years of age; thereafter the incidence and the severity reduce (Pandey 
et al. 2003). 
Place of occurrence of the orchard: Malformation disease is most severe in the 
places that experience high summer temperature and severe cold in winter 
months. But the coastal areas where the temperature remains on the higher side 
throughout the year suffer less from the disease (Chakrabarti, 2011). 
The disease incidence in the last cropping season: The dried malformed shoots 
and panicles hanging in the affected plants serve as the initial inoculum. Hence, 
the number of such dried, necrotic plant parts should be considered to predict the 
disease incidence in the forthcoming season (Chakrabarti et al. 2003). 
Chance of the diseased plants to enter endemic stage: The mango plants in an 
undisturbed orchard, suffer greatly for 3–4th consecutive years. Then the plants 
entered into endemic phase, i.e., the disease shows remission and remains at a 
stage of equilibrium unless the plants are disturbed (Chakrabarti et al. 2005). 
Environmental parameters: Environmental parameters during June–July, the time 
of fresh infection (Chand and Chakrabarti 2004; Chakrabarti et al. 1997) whereas 
the environmental parameters during November–February, the time of disease 
development (Chand and Chakrabarti, 2003; Chakrabarti et al. 1997). 
Number of malformed shoots on diseased plants: Malformed shoots occurring on 
the plants in October, the time of flower bud initiation, serve as initial inoculum 
(Pandey, 2003). 
The IPM technologies: The IPM technologies required to manage the disease of 
low, medium, and high-level intensity were identified (Chakrabarti and Kumar, 
2000; Kumar and Chakrabarti, 1998; Chakrabarti et al. 2009, Chakrabarti, 2011). 
Initially, the effects of these parameters on the survival of the pathogen and 
disease development under field conditions were recorded for several years. Then 
the individual effects of each of these parameters on the disease development were 
confirmed through laboratory tests under controlled conditions. Furthermore, theseobservations were tallied with published research results on the concerned topic 
from other laboratories. 
7.9 Architecture 79
7.9.2 Knowledge Structuring 
After the acquisition, knowledge needs to be structured. For example, to determine 
the effect of host age on the disease development and incidence on plants belonging 
to different age groups were recorded for consecutive 3 years under field conditions. 
The observations covered all the important commercial mango cultivars. Then these 
data according to the proximity of their values to each other were clubbed into three 
different broad groups viz. (i) plants of the age group of 5–15 years, (ii) plants are of 
16–25 years old, and (iii) in the third group the plants that are of more than 25 years 
old were included. The disease incidence and severity in plants of the first group 
showed an increasing trend and maximum disease susceptibility. In the second 
group, the incidence showed a diminishing trend and moderate in nature. In the 
third group, the disease incidence was mild and plants showed less susceptibility. 
And later used for the construction of knowledge base. This knowledge is stored in 
the form of a textual base. 
Further, the malformation symptoms on developing shoots showed many 
similarities with those of Shoot gall Psylla insect (Iudarbella quadrinotata) (Central 
Institute for Sub-tropical Horticulture, 1986) infestation. Thus, the farmers often 
become confused to identify the correct nature of the disease. Hence, the ES provides 
pictures of the malformed shoots to be used in the identification of the disease. This 
is known as a pictorial base and can also be considered as part of the 
knowledge base. 
7.9.3 Knowledge Representation 
This was done according to a rule consisting of an IF part and a THEN part (also 
called a condition and an action). The IF part lists a set of conditions in some logical 
combination. If the IF part of the rule is satisfied; consequently, the THEN part can 
be concluded, or its problem-solving action taken. With this provision, the user can 
write his own knowledge base in his own language. 
Example 
Correlation Between Disease Development and Environmental Variables 
IF atmospheric average maximum and minimum temperature are 270 C and 80 C, 
respectively; the RH is around 85%. 
THEN probability of severe disease manifestation is very high provided the 
others parameters are supportive. 
In this way, 11 rules that favor high-intensity disease development were framed 
for the present ES. Similarly, 11 rules for the probability of each of the moderate and 
low disease incidences were framed.80 7 Expert System
Finally, all the variables of host, pathogen, and climate that effect the disease 
development were put together under the IF and THEN collectively concluded the 
degree of disease intensity. 
Next to get the management schedule, the THEN part was used as IF, and it will 
result into (THEN) recommending the IPM schedule. 
7.9.4 Software Requirements 
The ES uses a Fuzzy logic-based reasoning process to analyze the symptoms and 
prescribed an approximate disease management and crop protection strategy. The 
Microsoft.NET (VB. NET) software and Fuzzy logic-based reasoning were used to 
develop this expert system for mango malformation disease. 
7.9.5 Knowledge Verification and Validation 
This is the stage whereby quality assurance of the acquired knowledge was made by 
verifying and validating through replicated trials in Rudauli-Showal mango belt of 
the district Faizabad, Uttar Pradesh for consecutive 5 years (Chakrabarti et al. 2009). 
The verification process ensures that the knowledge in the system is consistent, 
complete, and correct according to the required specification. 
7.9.6 Inference Engine 
The proposed ES has already a single target disease, i.e., malformation and then 
requires a set of rules to prove whether the target disease exists or not and its 
possibility to occur in epidemic form or otherwise. The feature corresponding to 
this expert system is placed in backward-chain rules including parameters. Each 
parameter contains explanations for questions, and background rules to decide value 
of parameters, question statements, and pictures related to the particular question of 
the disease. Design of this system follows top-down design approach. The developed 
knowledge base is stored in the compiled format for faster consultation. 
7.9.7 System Functionality and Structure 
The user can log in to the ES by using the buttons provided in the home page. Then 
the end users are provided with an image of malformed shoot and a panicle asked 
them to confirm the disease as malformation. The disease images assist the user in 
comparing the case evaluated with the identification result thus leading to the final 
confirmation. Later the users are asked 10 questions on the disease information in 
simple language. The disease information includes knowledge on other useful 
disease-related aspects such as pathogen, distribution, favorable climatic conditions,etc. Each questionnaire has a drop-down menu from which the user will select one. 
At the end, the system will provide the users IPM strategy that will best suit his 
cause.

Geographic Information Systems: 
Web-Based Disease Forecasting 8 
Currently, revolutionary advances in information technology and emergence of 
Internet, as well as global connectivity and integration with modern programming 
languages, have produced new concepts and ways to further generate and transfer of 
knowledge. Revolutions in web-based technologies are bringing major changes in 
the development and use of decision support systems by producers and specialists in 
the management of plant diseases. The main objectives of this research were to 
develop and implement a web-based forecasting system to predict plant epidemics to 
avoid unnecessary applications of pesticide and reduce production costs. Plant 
disease management practices can be improved by using a geographic information 
system (GIS). A GIS is a computer system capable of assembling, storing, 
manipulating, and displaying data related to a position on the earth’s surface (Star 
and Estes 1990). GIS can now be installed on any recent model desktop computer 
(e.g., a Pentium personal computer with at least 32 MB of RAM is adequate for most 
applications) and does not require an in-depth understanding of the statistical and 
mathematical basis of the technology. GIS can be adapted to any size operation, and 
data can be incorporated at any scale from a single field to an agricultural region. 
Many problems should be studied on more than one scale. The capacity of govern￾ment institutions, the nation’s agricultural colleges and experiment stations, and 
private enterprises to provide spatially referenced information will open the way to 
farmers, pest control advisors, extension workers, and others to evaluate plant 
disease problems in a spatial context. New tools, including global positioning 
systems (GPS) (that are used to find the exact location of things) and geostatistics 
(a practical means to describe spatial patterns and interpolate value for the locations 
where samples were not taken), are available to use in connection with GIS. 
There are two main forms of GIS data: vector and raster. In vector data sets, map 
features such as points, lines, and polygons are organized and manipulated in a 
database. Vector (that represents force and velocity in a particular direction) data 
capture and store spatial details while raster (a computer program that allows users to 
create and edit images interactively on the computer screen and save them) data are

and soil pH. Satellite images and some image files produced by scanners are 
examples of raster data sets. GIS has been applied in agriculture for the spatial 
analysis of insect pests, weeds, and plant diseases. Weltzien (1988) introduced the 
term “Geophytopathology” to describe studies of spatial patterns of plant diseases, 
the causal understanding of these patterns, and the geographic aspects of disease 
control. He gave a detailed description of the use of maps to illustrate the spread of 
plant diseases over regional or even continental scales. Some important GPS, GIS, 
and geostatistics systems have been listed in Table 8.1.

Fig. 8.1 Schematic representation of the Late Blight Resistance Management system in Michigan86 8 Geographic Information Systems: Web-Based Disease Forecasting
8.2 Overall System Design 
The components of Late Blight Risk Management (LBRM) system (Nelson et al. 
1994; Wharton et al. 2008) are as follows: 
8.2.1 Linux Operational System 
8.2.1.1 PostgreSQL Relational Database Management System 
It efficiently stores, searches, and retrieves data in large databases. The main Perl 
program interfaces with the Michigan Automatic Weather Network (MAWN) 
weather database, downloads hourly temperature and humidity data for each 
MAWN station from the past 24 h, and calculates the number of hours in which 
the relative humidity was above 80% and the temperature was between 7.20 and 
11.7 °C, 11.7° and 15 °C, or 15° and 26.7 °C. This information is processed through 
a set of model rules to determine the disease severity value (DSV) for each MAWN 
station for the last 24 h. DSV data are then used by the script to update the 
recommendation level. Finally, all the variables calculated by the program are 
inserted into a DSV table in the LBRM database (Fig. 8.1). 
8.2.1.2 Apache Webserver, Using the Hypertext Pre-Processor (PHP) 
and Perl Programming Languages 
It serves as an interface between the database and the web server. The use of PHP 
allows displaying of web pages that are dynamically generated based on actions 
performed by the user. This provides the users with data-on-demand which is 
tailored to suit their needs. This information is presented to users via the website. 
8.2.1.3 The Google Maps Application Programming Interface (API; 
http://www.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/) 
It displays interactive map-based information to users. These maps are fully interac￾tive and allow users to zoom in or out on a location, or to pan left, right, up, and 
down to see areas that are hidden off-screen. 
8.3 Operational System 
When users navigate to the website, they are presented with an interactive map of 
Michigan with colored markers on it, when a user clicks on the name of a MAWN 
weather station in a marker information window on the front-page map or on the 
“Compare stations” page they are taken to a page which has detailed information for 
that station (Wharton et al. 2008). These pages are called the “Station Details” pages 
and each station has its own webpage. These pages are dynamically generated using 
data from the LBRM database and present the user with up-to-date DSV data for that 
particular weather station, and a spray recommendation based on the last 10 days of 
accumulated DSV. At the bottom of each page, there is also a drop-down menu.When a user selects a date from the drop-down box and hits the “Get Recommenda￾tion” button, a new webpage is generated with a table listing the DSV accumulated 
each day for the selected period, the total DSV accumulated, and a spray recommen￾dation based on the total accumulated DSV for the time period that was selected. 
8.4 Limitations 87
The current PLB model makes a very general estimate of canopy microclimate, 
which varies extensively due to spatial variability in topography (aspect, slope, and 
elevation), crop variety, crop health (canopy density, etc.), and irrigation. Growers 
have to take these factors into consideration along with the distance from their 
closest weather station when using the model. However, growers are usually 
aware of the topography of their fields and know which parts are most susceptible 
to disease. For these reasons, PLB model is considered as a general model to help in 
making disease management decisions within the framework of an integrated pest 
management (IPM) system. 
Geostatistics has been used in plant pathology to analyze the spatial distribution 
of plant disease epidemics, mainly at a plot or a field (Larkin et al. 1995). They have 
also been used in a regional risk assessment program for the management of plant 
virus diseases in Mexico (Nelson et al. 1994). Inoculum patterns at very small scales, 
such as along plant roots (Dandurand et al. 1995), have also been quantified using 
geostatistics. GIS maps of plant diseases and risk of plant disease can be created in a 
number of ways. Experts, including farmers, can synthesize personal observations 
from memory and generate maps simply by sketching polygons (a closed bounded 
plane region by straight sides) over appropriately referenced backgrounds. Spatially 
located field observations of incidence combined with weather data can be used 
effectively for certain aerially dispersed fungal diseases. Continental-scale risk maps 
for blue mold of tobacco have been published on the World Wide Web 3 days a week 
during the tobacco growing season since 1996. 
The system was designed to allow easy addition of new diseases and locations 
(stations) with modularity as the most important aspect of the overall design. The 
contents are added and maintained by an administrator through a private web-based 
tool, with no knowledge of web programming languages required. In contrast, most 
of the expert systems have a static knowledge base with static reasoning and 
inference techniques. Therefore, the decision-taking power of these conventional 
systems remains the same throughout the life of the system unless the knowledge 
engineer modifies the system explicitly. The available systems also need further 
improvements by adding an effective interactive user interface by deploying the 
available multimedia tools. 
8.4 Limitations 
1. Associated cost: Practically, the biggest drawback is the cost associated with the 
time needed to learn the software and to acquire the data. Research is needed on 
cost/benefit analyses of GIS applications in agriculture. GIS is of little practical 
value when a spatial pattern is uniform in contrast to no uniform patterns. On the88 8 Geographic Information Systems: Web-Based Disease Forecasting
other extreme, if the change in pattern is faster than data can be acquired, spatially 
referenced data might be skewed and misleading. 
2. Involve teamwork: Most successful applications of this technology involve 
teamwork. A good team should include an experienced field person, an experi￾enced computer user with some background in statistics, and a patient data entry 
person. Such a combination is not always available and is rare in a single 
individual. Larger farms, younger farmers, and better-funded extension programs 
are more likely to apply these tools. An agricultural GIS strongly requires 
computer resources and skills. 
3. Limited effectivity: Furthermore, it cannot be a solution to all plant disease 
management problems (Merritt et al. 1999). 
8.5 Merit 
It is believed that the integration of GIS, GPS, and geostatistics provides a tool for 
the refined analysis of traditional and contemporary biological/ecological informa￾tion on plant diseases. It will aid practitioners in the design of disease management in 
IPM programs, particularly on a regional scale. It will also provide a way of 
analyzing and communicating results of regional programs on a continuing basis. 
The availability of software capable of producing attractive maps provides an 
opportunity to visually communicate plant disease situations to a variety of 
audiences. GIS and geostatistics are particularly useful in identifying recurring 
patterns of plant disease, as well as other problems such as insect and weed 
infestations. The association of environmental factors, landscape features, and 
cropping patterns with the recurrence of disease or other problems can be readily 
communicated to key managers and decision-makers.

Decision Support Systems and Expert 
Systems: A Comparison 9 
In recent years, there have been rapid developments in two technologies aimed at 
improving decision-making: decision support systems (DSS) and expert systems 
(ES). A DSS is an interactive system that helps decision-makers utilize data and 
models to solve unstructured or semi-structured problems, i.e., the problem is not 
precisely stated in terms of data. An ES is a problem-solving computer program that 
achieves good performance in a specialized problem domain that is considered 
difficult and requires specialized knowledge and skill. While both types seek to 
improve the quality of the decision, there are some distinct differences between the 
two (Ford 1985). 
9.1 Definition of DSS 
(i) A DSS helps decision-makers utilize data and models to solve unstructured or 
semi-structured problems. 
(ii) DSS do not provide answers to structured problems; rather, they emphasize 
direct support for decision-makers in order to enhance the professional 
judgments required in their decision-making. 
(iii) There is an interplay between user and computer that produces a total effort 
greater than that attained by the user and the computer operating independently; 
this provides synergistic decision-making. 
9.2 Definition of ES 
(i) An expert system is a problem-solving program. 
(ii) The systems process the knowledge of experts (specialized problem domain) 
and attempt to mimic their thinking, skill, and intuition.

https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-1210-0_990 9 Decision Support Systems and Expert Systems: A Comparison
9.3 Characteristics of DSS (Sprague and Carlson 1982) 
(i) They tend to be directed at the less well-structured, under-specified problems. 
(ii) DSS creates an environment in which a decision-maker can, with relative ease, 
apply quantitative analysis techniques. 
(iii) They focus on features that make them easy and convenient to use interactively 
by noncomputer people. 
(iv) They emphasize flexibility and adaptability to accommodate changes in 
decision-making. Allow modification of the configuration so that the DSS 
can handle a changing set of problems. 
9.4 Characteristics of ES (Fisher 1984) 
(i) Their domain of application is well-defined and sufficiently narrowly bounded 
so that the successful coding of relevant knowledge is likely. 
(ii) There is at least one human expert to help develop the knowledge base. 
(iii) ES employs heuristic problem solving (a commonsense rule that serves to guide 
decisions instead of formal reasoning). The tasks have no algorithmic solutions 
(a specific rule specifying how to solve a problem) and inferences must often be 
made based on incomplete or uncertain information. 
(iv) ESs contain and use three different general kinds of information: task-specific 
(that data relevant only to current ES analysis), domain-specific (the knowledge 
base, including problem-solving rules and data relevant to the field), and 
control (the inference engine, which uses axiomatic (evident without proof or 
argument) knowledge to arrive at possible solutions). 
9.5 Structure of DSS (Sprague and Carlson 1982) 
DSS consists of three major components or basic subsystems, i.e., dialog, data, and 
models. All the capabilities of the DSS must be articulated and implemented dialog 
subsystem. The data subsystem maintains stores and retrieves data from the data￾base, extracts data from various sources, etc. The models subsystem contains the 
library of models and routines to maintain and manage them. These are interfaced 
with the dialog subsystem through which the user has control over the operation, 
manipulation, and use of the models, and with the data subsystem so that appropriate 
model data can be provided. 
9.6 Structure of ES (Ford 1985) 
The structure of ES contains three essential components a task-specific database, the 
knowledge base, and the inference engine. The structure of ES as compared to that of 
DSS is more complex system. Added here are a user interface system, an explanationsystem, and a knowledge-based development system. The first manages and 
executes all dialog and communication between the user and the ES. The second 
provides, at the user’s request, the underlying logic or reasoning process that led to 
the specific conclusions. The function of the third is to facilitate the creation and 
maintenance of the knowledge base by aiding in knowledge acquisition plus 
constructing, debugging (prevention of incorrect operation of a software to resolve 
bugs or defects), updating, and testing of the knowledge base. 
Programming Language Used to Construct DSS and ES (Ford 1985) 91
9.7 Objectives and Intents of DSS and ES 
The objective of a DSS is to support the user in making a decision by providing 
quick and easy access to data and models relevant and applicable to that decision. 
The data and models are at the user’s disposal, to be used as desired. 
The objective of an ES, on the other hand, is to provide the user with a conclusion 
or decision that is correct all the time. The ES provides conclusions or decisions to 
the on-expert user that are more likely to be correct than that user could provide. 
9.8 Programming Language Used to Construct DSS and ES 
(Ford 1985) 
For DSS, the core language used is most frequently a traditional high-level language, 
such as BASIC or FORTRAN, or a nonprocedural modeling language system. The 
nature of the models, typically mathematical algorithms, used in DSS accounts for 
this approach. 
ES, on the other hand, is typically constructed using LISP and other languages 
that are more effective in representing and processing the symbolic type of informa￾tion needed for expert system development and application. 
Users of DSS are mostly upper and middle managers who helped design the 
system. ES users, on the other hand, are typically scientists or researchers who did 
not develop the system. The development approach commonly used for both DSS 
and ES is the prototyping (the first model from which other forms will be developed) 
approach, although the development of ES is more time-consuming. 
Decision support system (DSS) and expert system (ES) are two buzzwords in the 
information technology community. According to Pfeifer and Lüthi (1987), DSS and 
ES are two approaches rather than just systems. Both the systems considerably differ 
in general goals and paradigms, problem domain, model type, usage modality, and 
design and implementation. However, they concluded that DSS and ES should be 
considered as complementary concepts.92 9 Decision Support Systems and Expert Systems: A Comparison

Forecasting in Changed Climate 10 
10.1 Climate Change 
Climate is the average weather in a place over many years and climate change refers 
to any change in climate over times, either due to natural variability or as the result of 
human activity. 
In recent years, sustainability of the global environment has become the gravest 
National and International concern. Since industrial revolution global climate has 
changed. The major greenhouse gases especially carbon dioxide has increased by 
30% while tropospheric ozone by two- to five-fold). In the past 150 years, the 
average surface temperature has increased by 0.76 °C Inter-Governmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC 2007). It is apprehended that the global mean temperature 
may rise between 0.9 and 3.5 °C by the year 2100. The speed of climate change and 
the unpredictability of its effects are of great concern with respect to the pathogens, 
insect pests, and weeds that reduce crop yield. As climate influences all stages of 
host and pathogen life cycles and the disease development, with change in climate 
disease severity over a period may also fluctuate. 
10.2 Causes of Climate Change and Its Effects on Disease 
Incidence 
For changing climate rather its deterioration, the onus mainly goes to the human 
society; however, natural process is also responsible to some extent in altering the 
climatic condition. 
Among natural factors, both (i) volcanoes and (ii) intensity of solar radiation are 
the most important. 
The human society damages the climate through the emission of Green House 
gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrousoxide, chlorofloro carbon, ozone, and 
water vapor. Besides deforestation and ever-increasing urbanization are also

manifested in the release of more heat into the space whereas in human enhanced 
Green House effect it happened just opposite.
94 10 Forecasting in Changed Climate
Global warming exerts the following damages on agriculture: (i) loss of fertile 
coastal land due to raising of sea level, (ii) loss of biodiversity, (iii) occurrence of 
frequent storm, flood, or drought, (iv) increased disease and pest incidence, and 
(v) crops in cool region take longer growing period. 
Increase in carbon dioxide level promotes the vegetative growth of plants which 
in turn provides the pathogen a congenial microclimate. Thus, a higher incidence of 
powdery mildew, rust, anthracnose, Alternaria blight, and Stempylium blight was 
recorded. High carbon dioxide level has also been reported to decrease the immunity 
of barley plants but at the same time it increases the reproductive capacity of its 
pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporides resulting into more incidence of anthracnose 
on barley crop. Similarly increasing of temperature from 26 to 31 °C, the resistance 
of Anthurium plants to bacterial blight (Xanthomonas axonopodis) was broken 
down. Dry root rot (Rhizoctonia bataticola) was reported in Fusarium wilt resistant 
chickpea if the temperature exceeds 33 °C. In elevated levels of carbon dioxide 
Erisyphe cichoracearum, the pathogen of powdery mildew develops more colonies 
on mature leaves of Arabipodis species. Increase in carbon dioxide level also 
increases the number of blast lesions on the leaves of a panicle of rice. A higher 
incidence rice sheath blight was also recorded. Higher carbon dioxide together with 
increased ozone level increased brown spot severity on soybean. In the region where 
both rainfall and relative humidity remain high during the growing season, the 
incidence of Late Blight of potato, Apple Scab, Downy mildew of grapes, and Fire 
Blight are found severe. Botrytis cinera can infect potato leaves only when they are 
injured due to the elevation level of ozone. Excess soil moisture favors many 
dreaded soil-borne pathogens like Pythum, Phytophthora, Rhizoctonia, Sclerotium 
species, some bacteria, e.g,. Erwinia, Pseudomonas, and nematode pathogens. If the 
leaves remain wet for a longer period incidence of powdery mildew and late blight 
increase. High wind velocity is helpful for the dissemination of airborne fungal and 
bacterial diseases. Reduced light intensity increases the susceptibility of plants to 
virus infection. 
Climate change may create uncertainty in disease management strategies. 
Delayed planting to avoid a pathogen may become less reliable. There may be 
problems with the applications of bio-control agents in the field because of the 
vulnerability of bio-control agent populations to climate variation. If consistent 
availability of appropriate temperature and moisture are affected by the biocontrol 
agents due to environmental variations and environmental extremes, bio-control 
agents applied in the fields may not grow and multiply sufficiently up to the level 
that can inhibit or eliminate the pathogens (Mina and Sinha 2008).10.3 Global Warming and Its Impact on Pest Risk 95
10.3 Global Warming and Its Impact on Pest Risk 
Climate change has already resulted in increases in globally averaged mean annual 
air temperature and variations in regional precipitation, increased occurrence of 
extreme weather events like floods and droughts, rise in sea levels, etc. As per the 
fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
(IPCC-AR-5), increase of global mean surface temperatures for 2081–2100 relative 
to 1986–2005 is projected to likely be in the range of 2.6 °C–4.8 °C under RCP 8.5 
scenario (Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change i.e. IPCC 2007). 
In India, climate change is affecting the agriculture due to 0.74 ° C average global 
increase in temperature in the last 100 years and atmospheric CO2 increase from 
280 ppm in 1750 to 400 ppm in 2013. Throughout the twenty-first century, India is 
projected to experience warming above the global mean. A warming trend has been 
observed along the coastal west coast, in central India, the interior peninsula, and 
Northeast India. Based on the prediction of IPCC, there would be an increase of 
1–3 ° C in temperature in mid to high-latitude regions by 2050 which shows a 
positive correlation with CO2 concentration. The increase in CO2 concentration 
and changes in rainfall patterns may have beneficial impacts on crop yield. However, 
moderate temperature increase (1–2 ° C) is likely to have negative impacts on the 
yield of the major cereals in low-latitude regions. The regional distribution patterns 
of diseases getting modified as per the changes of climatic factors (Shekhar and 
Singh 2021). 
High atmospheric CO2 concentrations, temperatures, and changes in precipitation 
patterns as well as the frequency of extreme weather phenomena will significantly 
affect crop grow and production, and therefore the presence of diseases will be 
altered under these conditions (Rosenzweig and Tubiello 2007). Climate change will 
affect each region differently, and its impacts will be observed gradually. Climate 
change will affect each region differently, and its impacts will be observed gradually. 
Garofalo (2019) apprehended that in Massachusetts, changes in weather 
parameters due to climate change may increase the incidence and severity of major 
apple disease like apple scab caused by Venturia inaequalis. Likewise Bourgeois 
et al. (2004) predicted that, as a result of climate change, the number of infections 
will increase during the primary apple scab season in Quebec, largely the result of 
significantly earlier inoculum availability and tree growth, while the end of primary 
inoculum availability stays constant. 
The severity of rust disease on soybean in Colombia was reported to increase with 
warming. The severity of the increase in temperature regimes in a warm environ￾ment, in turns leads to more favorable conditions for the pathogen (Bregaglio 2012). 
Evans et al. (2007, 2013) studied the effects of climate change on some important 
oilseed rape diseases in Europe. viz., Sclerotinia stem rot and Leptosphaeria phoma 
stem canker, and two soil borne, Verticillium longisporum, and clubroot 
(Plasmodiophora brassicae). They predicted that milder winter weather under future 
climates may significantly extend the period of time for infection and thus increase 
the incidence of Sclerotinia stem rot and damage potential of this pathogen. The 
predicted weather for future periods (the 2020s, 2050s) under low or high CO2emission scenarios suggest that the range of Phoma stem canker disease will extend 
northwards, so that farmers in Scotland, who currently have Phoma leaf spotting 
may start to have problems with stem canker. Verticillium is a disease that has 
increased particularly in the cooler oilseed rape growing regions in Europe. Given a 
temperature threshold for infection of 15 °C and a 2 °C increase in mean soil 
temperature may significantly aggravate the impact of Verticillium disease in the 
future. 
96 10 Forecasting in Changed Climate
In Uganda, climate change is also putting stem rust resistance due to Sr31 under 
threat of Ug99 race of stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Gautam 
et al., 2013). 
It was recorded in South Korea, due to climate change, the temperature has been 
constantly rising, and the intensity and frequency of extreme climate events have 
been increasing. As a result, the pattern of crop disease occurrence is changing, with, 
for instance, an augmentation in the incidence of thermophilic diseases such as rice 
stripe and bacterial leaf blight (Kim et al. 2020). 
It has been estimated that changes in climate have already been reducing global 
agricultural production by 1–5% per decade over the last 30 years. The greatest yield 
reductions have been observed in tropical cereals such as maize and rice. The trend 
of reduced production is projected to continue in the future. (Newbery et al. 2016). 
In India, in the last decade, the disease scenario of chickpea and pigeon pea has 
changed drastically (Mahapatra et al. 2018); dry root rot (Rhizoctonia bataticola) of 
chickpea and Phytophthora blight (Phytophthora drechsleri f. sp. cajani) of pigeon 
pea have emerged as a potential threat to the production of these pulses (Pandey and 
Shanna, 2010). Higher risk of dry root rot has been reported in Fusarium wilt 
chickpea-resistant varieties in those years when the temperature exceeds 33 °C 
(Dixon, 2012). It was reported that temperature is one of the most important factors 
affecting the occurrence of bacterial diseases also such as Ralstonia solanacearum, 
Acidovorax avenae, and Burkholderia glumea (Kudela, 2009). Thus, bacteria could 
proliferate in areas where temperature-dependent diseases have not been previously 
observed. Similarly, the incidence of most of the virus and other vector-borne 
diseases will be altered. This is because climate can substantially influence the 
development and distribution of vectors. The effect of climate change (CC) has 
also been observed on different diseases in Himachal Pradesh. In apple, due to lesser 
rainfall in the rainy season and more severe summers, the incidence of different 
canker diseases due to fungal pathogens are increasing (Sharma, 2012). 
Elevated temperature and CO2 concentration are also posing a higher threat 
perception of late blight (Phytophthora infestans) disease of potato and important 
diseases of rice, namely, blast (Pyricularia oryzae) and sheath blight (Rhizoctonia 
solani) (Gautam et al. 2013).10.5 Forecasting Model Tailored for Climate Change 97
10.4 Disease Management Strategy in Changed Climate 
Since last few decades, much before the climate change debate started, plant 
pathologists are engaged in investigating the pathogen–host–environmental relation￾ship and their interaction to understand the nature of an epidemic and forecast its 
probable time of outbreak beforehand so that they can solicit the farmers to adopt 
spraying schedule in optimum time and dosages. These data have been used to 
construct weather-based forecasting models. Such disease forecast models can now 
be adapted to simulate the epidemic behavior or geographic spread of a particular 
pathogen under hypothetical future climatic conditions (Evans et al. 2007). But it has 
also been reported that results from climate models vary considerably and have a low 
spatial and temporal resolution (IPPC 2007). However, for constructing weather￾based forecasting models to meet the challenge of climate change two important 
factors have to be considered. First, the most uncertain factor in global change 
research with regard to crop diseases is global change prediction itself. The extent 
and kind of climate change itself remain speculative. Second, the effects of climatic 
factors may be short-term or long-term. Short-term effects relate to preexisting 
pathogens and crops. In the long-term, if climate change is greater, it may induce 
the invasion and establishment of novel pathogen or pest species, causing significant 
changes in the species composition. These direct effects on diseases may all be 
influenced by indirect effects, which are due to the adaptation of new crop produc￾tion techniques to climate change. In the short-term, this may result in altered sowing 
dates, reduced soil tillage, or enhanced irrigation. In the long-term, farmers may go 
for changing to alternative crops or increasing the proportion of individual crops in 
the rotation scheme. Such changes will have a considerable impact on pests and 
diseases and are a response to climate change (Evans et al. 2007). 
10.5 Forecasting Model Tailored for Climate Change 
10.5.1 Multi-Model Ensembles 
Kim et al. (2015), Kim and Cho (2015), and Kim and Jung (2020) predicted potential 
epidemics of rice diseases using multi-model ensembles for assessment of climate 
change impacts with uncertainty information. The procedure of constructing their 
forecasting model is presented here. 
Savary et al. (2012) developed EPIRICE to evaluate intensity and distribution of 
five major rice diseases (brown spot, leaf blast, bacterial blight, sheath blight, and 
tungro) at a global scale. Among these, Kim et al. (2015) selected rice leaf blast and 
sheath blight for the application of the EPIRICE model in Korea. As a result, 
EPIRICE-LB was developed to simulate leaf blast and EPIRICE-SB for sheath 
blight. 
Rice blast disease, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is of major economic impor￾tance and is reported to occur in 6 ° Countries (Parthasarathy and Ou 1965). Sheathblight, caused by Rhizoctonia solani, is also a major rice disease (Lee and Rush, 
1983). 
98 10 Forecasting in Changed Climate
Earlier studies (Kobayashi et al. 2006; Luo et al., 1998; Webb et al. 2010) on 
climate change impacts on rice diseases have aimed at analyzing the effects of 
climate change components on specific disease cycle phases in particular 
pathosystems or on modeling the effects of climate change on risk probability. 
Often, the results indicated increased epidemics. But sometimes the opposite effect 
manifests depending on pathosystems or several interacting factors. For example, 
under elevated CO2 concentrations, the potential risks of infection with rice leaf blast 
and epidemics of rice sheath blight have been reported to increase (Kobayashi et al. 
2006). However, Luo et al. (1998) predicted that elevated temperatures would result 
in less severe blast epidemics in most locations in Korea. In addition, sheath blight is 
a typical tropical rice disease favored by high temperature and high relative humidity 
(Lee and Rush, 1983). The projected climate of the Korean Peninsula showed 
increased temperature with enhanced precipitation toward 2100 (Ahn and Hong 
2013). Thus, it is anticipated that sheath blight will remain to be one of the rice 
diseases to be favored by a climate change regime. 
Kim et al. (2015) analyzed likely changes in probabilities of the two major rice 
diseases in Korea with only one high-resolution climate change scenario that was 
generated by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). The impact results 
revealed that the incidence of epidemics for both diseases was simulated to gradually 
decrease toward 2100. Kim et al. (2015) examined whether this conclusion is valid 
when considered across the range of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) fifth Assessment Report (AR5) multi-model climate projections. Addition￾ally, they analyzed the possible changes in the probability of rice diseases separately 
at three climatic zones in Korea: Northern, Central, and Southern Areas that have 
diverse climate conditions. For example, the mean temperature in the Northern Area 
for 30 years (1976–2005) is about 11 °C. During the same time period, it is 14 °C in 
the Southern Area, whilst the annual precipitation is around 1300 mm for both zones. 
On the other hand, the Northern Area is characterized by slightly wetter conditions 
compared to the Southern Area based on the mean relative humidity records over the 
30 years. There are inherent uncertainties in climate projections from GCMs. These 
uncertainties need to be considered and translated into probabilities, ranges, or 
quantified uncertainties in climate change impact analysis. 
They described how climate projections from a multi-model ensemble can be 
used for impact assessments. This is to show the importance of considering multiple 
models for analyzing climate change impacts on certain biological interactions. By 
treating each global climate model (GCM) projection as an equally possible climate 
outcome, at first, a single climate change impact result on rice disease epidemics 
without any information on uncertainty was estimated. Generating an ensemble from 
all of the impact assessment results, we could explore the uncertainty in the 
estimated impacts on rice disease epidemics resulting from the uncertainty in climate 
projections from multiple GCMs. Additionally, the possible changes in the proba￾bility of rice diseases were analyzed separately in three climatic zones in Korea: 
Northern, Central, and Southern Areas, which were divided based on19 agro-climatic zones determined in previous studies (Lee et al. 2012; Shim et al. 
2011). These locations represent diverse climate conditions with very specific 
characteristics. 
10.5 Forecasting Model Tailored for Climate Change 99
For the climate change scenario, 11 GCMs were selected because the selected 
GCMs provided all weather variables (temperature, precipitation, and relative 
humidity) in a daily scale required for EPIRICE run. The selected 11 GCMs were 
spatially downscaled to the points of 58 KMA Surface weather observing network 
(ASOS) stations for historical (1976–2005), near future (2011–2040), and distant 
future (2041–2070) periods using the nonparametric quantile mapping method. 
Historical observed data for 30 years were obtained from each ASOS station and 
were used as a reference for the quantile mapping method. 
Compared to the observed data from each ASOS station, the bias-corrected data 
appropriately reflected the temporal (monthly) trends of the selected weather 
variables (data not shown). Output data of the Hadley Centre climate model 
(HadGEM2-AO) were downscaled using HadGEM3-RA by the Korea Meteorologi￾cal Research Institute (METRI) to produce a high resolution (12.5 km) regional 
scenario based on the RCP 8.5 scenario which has been widely used in previous 
impact analyses in Korea. The KMA 12.5 km scenario was also used to compare 
with other GCM scenarios. For each GCM and the KMA 12.5 km climate scenario, 
site-specific climate scenarios in a daily time scale were generated and used by 
EPIRICE model to compute the statistics of disease potentials for both rice diseases, 
leaf blast, and sheath blight. The final multi-model ensemble results were generated 
by combining all EPIRICE results from the individual GCM scenarios and subse￾quently averaging them all to get a mean value. To present this disease impact 
statistic, computed for all GCMs and the multi-model ensemble, and these were 
combined as a box plot. The box plot for the multi-model ensemble illustrates the 
range of uncertainty in estimating the rice disease epidemics resulting from the 
uncertainty in climate projections. 
All simulations were run for 100 days period for both models. Annual simulated 
potential epidemics (represented as the AUDPC) for the leaf blast and sheath blight 
diseases were outputs from the models. The AUDPC was calculated by adding the 
daily disease severity for the entire growing season, providing information about the 
dynamics of disease development, and assessing disease intensity. Disease 
epidemics were summarized by computing the 30-year mean of the potential 
AUDPC for each period: 1976–2005 for the observed and the historical, 
2011–2040 for the near future, and 2041–2070 for the distant future. The resulting 
AUDPCs were presented using a box plot. Thus, the box plots show a measure of the 
potential disease intensity for a particular disease throughout a cropping season. 
This final result showed the range of uncertainty in the prediction of rice disease 
epidemics resulting from limitations in our current understanding of the climate 
system as modeled by GCMs. In a practical sense, this kind of result that accounts 
for uncertainty from climate models can provide more reliable information on where 
and what intensity of epidemics may occur, their temporal patterns over the years, 
and guidance with respect to the assessment of disease risk probability. This will 
enable the development of basic methodological components that could be used in asubsequent risk management process such as linking with agrochemical applications 
or applying rice cultivar profiles with respect to disease resistance. 
100 10 Forecasting in Changed Climate
This approach is important considering the uncertainty embedded in all climate 
projections from GCMs due to structural differences and variable initial conditions 
of the GCMs. By incorporating the differences among individual projections into the 
multi-model ensemble, we could successfully explore and provide stakeholders the 
range of uncertainty in the results from climate change impact assessment, which 
will help them to make more robust risk management plans for the future. At the 
same time, our results emphasized that making any conclusions based on a single 
climate model analysis should be avoided because it may lead to biased decisions. 
10.6 Integrated Modeling Approach 
Newlands (2018) developed a model-based disease risk forecasting framework and 
tested it against wheat stripe rust disease. The results show that in the future, a 
model-based forecasting approach, if supported with an airborne surveillance moni￾toring plan, could be made operational to provide reliable, cost-effective, and near￾real-time information for protecting crop production against multiple disease threats. 
His model is being presented here. 
Model-Based Forecasting of Agricultural Crop Disease Risk at the Regional 
Scale was tested against available disease data collected for wheat stripe (yellow) 
rust (Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici) (Pst). Two stochastic models are evaluated: a 
simpler, site-specific model, and a more complex, spatially explicit transmission 
model. The ability of these models to reproduce an observed infection pattern was 
tested using two climate datasets with different spatial resolutions—a reanalysis 
dataset (~55 km) and weather station network township-aggregated data (~10 km). 
Newlands (2018) observed that the complex spatially explicit model using weather 
station network data had the highest forecast accuracy. The data obtained from a 
multi-scale airborne surveillance design would further improve disease risk forecast 
accuracy under heterogeneous modeling assumptions. Thus, a model-based 
forecasting approach, if supported with an airborne surveillance monitoring plan, 
could provide reliable, cost-effective, and near-real-time information against multi￾ple disease threats. 
The integrated framework was designed to take into account major aspects and 
considerations involved in operational model-based forecasting of crop disease at the 
regional scale. This approach combines data on host, pathogen, and environment, 
and models to capture different aspects of disease dynamics under different 
assumptions. The framework integrates threshold-based infection and multivariate 
spatial assumptions and includes a broader, more representative set of disease 
dynamic parameters, climate covariates, and assumptions on disease–climate inter￾action and spatial dependence. Its component-wide structure permits scaling-up 
from homogeneous to heterogeneous assumptions, whereby a region is divided 
into smaller subregions, with transmission assumed to occur between them and acalibrated model used to capture their specific disease dynamics, susceptibility, 
incidence, and risk. 
10.9 Linked Process-Based Models 101
10.7 The Site-Specific Model (CLR) 
The site-specific model (CLR) with the coarser the JRA-Year Reanalysis (JRA-55) 
input was able to reproduce the general shape of the observed Pst detection (2015 at 
Lethbridge) on the basis of assumptions of critical thresholds of wetness and 
temperature response, and Weibull-distributed germination/infection processes. 
The model predicts the rate of infection (slope of mid-season peak) well, but predicts 
a narrower peak width (timing of main infection peak rise and fall) and predicts peak 
infection a week earlier than it occurred. Predictions of the model are more variable 
during the early- and late-season, which is attributed to higher variability in the 
weather conditions (i.e., fluctuations in canopy wetness and temperature. 
10.8 The Spatial Model (hhh4) 
Using the same coarse JRA climate input data, the spatial hhh4 model with spatial 
transmission assumptions while not the best fit obtained to the observed infection 
curve, like the CLR site-specific model, does also predict a narrow peak. However, 
in the spatial model (hhh4), model predictions are less variable in early/late season 
and it predicts peak infection time correctly. This indicates that assumptions on how 
Pst immigrates, overwinters, and moves between subregions are important for 
accurately determining both infection variability in the early/late season as well as 
the timing of peak infection. Changing the spatial resolution of climate input data, 
i.e., from JRA regional scale to finer the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) 
township scale, improved the prediction of width of the infection peak. This is 
especially crucial, as it is at this time that disease dynamics can switch from an 
endemic, to an epidemic disease occurrence pattern. 
10.9 Linked Process-Based Models 
Fernandes et al. (2004) assessed the potential impact of climate change in the 
epidemics of Fusarium Head Blight in wheat-growing regions in southern Brazil, 
Uruguay, and Argentina. Following is the description of the model. 
Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) caused by Gibberella zeae Schwain (Petch) causes 
contamination of wheat with the mycotoxin Desoxinivalenol (DON) making the 
grains unsuitable for human consumption. In FHB, the fungal spores are carried 
through pollens to the flower and then grow into the kernels, glumes, or other head 
parts. 
The modified version of a model developed by Del Ponte et al. (unpublished) was 
used. The model starts by the time of the emergence of the first group of heads.102 10 Forecasting in Changed Climate
The coupling of both heading and flowering models results in the daily proportion 
of exposed anthers in the field. Infection is defined by means of a combination of 
daily records of rainfall and mean relative humidity in a two-day window. Infection 
rate is a function of mean temperature during each infection time. Potential 
infections up to 14 days after flowering were taken into account. The daily risk 
index is the product of the proportion of susceptible tissue, infection rate, and spore 
cloud density. Final risk is calculated by the summation of partial indices. Rates and 
rules in the models are influenced by weather variables as daily mean temperature, 
daily mean relative humidity, daily solar radiation, precipitation, and consecutive 
rainy days. The model evaluation with disease data from 5 years of epidemics in 
Brazil showed that risk estimated by model explained over 95% of variation in 
disease field severity. The infection events are defined by means of observations of 
rainfall (>0.5 mm) in a two-day window. Hence, daily risk index is the product of 
the proportion of susceptible tissue and infection rate. 
Climatic Data—In each one of the selected sites historical weather data included 
daily values of maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, and solar radia￾tion from 1970 to 2000. Climate change scenarios were obtained based on LARS￾WG and HadleyCM3 projections. LARS-WG is a stochastic weather generator that 
may be used for the simulation of weather data at a single site, under both current and 
future climate conditions. In the present investigation, LARS-WG was used to obtain 
synthetic weather series taking into account the changes that occurred in climate 
during the last century (comparing the periods 1930–1960 to 1970–2000). By means 
of Hadley CM3, under A2 emissions scenario centered in 2020, the second climate 
change scenario was obtained. For this purpose, the rate of change of each variable 
(from the comparison between GCM projections and the baseline period 
(1960–1990) was applied to the daily climate record in each site. 
10.10 Our Observations (Mittal and Chakrabarti, Unpublished) 
In case of multi-model ensembles, the tools like excel, spss are unsuccessful in 
implementing the multi-model ensemble functions hence to implement the model a 
code for statistical computing in R environment can be used (https://www.r-project. 
org/). R-code can have the use of libraries “rgdal,” “readr,” “tidyverse,” “ggplot,” 
“ensembleBMA,” “ensembleMOS,” and “EnsembleML.” EnsembleML is an R 
package for ensemble in machine learning is able to combine and build regression 
and classification models and combine those models to be an ensemble. 
Similarly in the integrated modeling approach also, the tools like excel, spss are 
unsuccessful in implementing the function of HHR and hence in this case also for 
implementation the model a code for statistical computing in R environment may be 
used (https://www.r-project.org/). R-code can have the use of libraries “rgdal,” 
“readr,” “tidyverse,” “spdep,” “surveillance,”and “hhh4 contacts.” 
For Linked process-based model, the development of a program in R environ￾ment can help implement a stochastic weather generator. A few packages can beloaded help the run the simulators in R “dplyr,” “lubridate,” “tidyyr,” “ggplot2,” 
“moments,” and “weathergen.”

Disease Detection: Imaging Technology 
and Remote Sensing 11 
11.1 Imaging Techniques and Spectroscopic for Disease 
Detection 
The spectroscopic and imaging techniques are unique disease monitoring methods 
that have been used to detect diseases and stress due to various factors, in plants and 
trees. Current research activities are toward the development of such technologies to 
create a practical tool for large-scale real-time disease monitoring under field 
conditions. Spectroscopic technology has been successfully applied for plant stress 
detection such as water-stress detection and nutrient-stress detection. In addition, 
there have also been significant applications for monitoring the quality of posthar￾vest fruits and vegetables. Various spectroscopic and imaging techniques have been 
studied for the detection of symptomatic and asymptomatic plant diseases. Some of 
the methods are: hyperspectral imaging, hyperspectral imaging, fluorescence imag￾ing, fluorescence spectroscopy, visible and infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear mag￾netic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. 
Spectral analysis is relatively easy to apply as it is a noninvasive method and does 
not require further operations. For a long time, it has been used for the analysis of the 
physiological status of plants and for the determination of chlorophyll and 
carotenoids contents in leaves. It also reflects changes in the contents and the relative 
proportions of other quality-relevant compounds of crops. Spectral analysis is also 
commonly applied in remote sensing. Besides, the utilization of spectral analysis for 
the detection of fungal and bacterial diseases is extensively being investigated. Both 
fungi and bacteria usually cause damage at molecular, cellular, and/or tissue levels, 
which, in turn, can be detected as changes in the spectral signatures. 
The high-resolution imaging such as videography and digital image analysis at 
various spectral ranges have made it possible to detect different plant diseases. The 
spectroscopic and imaging techniques include fluorescence spectroscopy, visible-IR 
spectroscopy, fluorescence imaging, and hyperspectral imaging.

(i) Hyper-spectral imaging. Local variations in the disease-induced physiologi￾cal alterations of the plant tissues may help to early identify the development of 
the infection. For example, distinct changes in the visible (VIS) and near￾infrared (NIR) range in spring wheat leaves were recorded after infection 
with Drechslera triticirepenti (Muhammed and Larsolle 2003). Similarly, 
three Puccinia rust species could be determined by image analyses of different 
visible and near-infrared wavelength ranges in wheat leaves (Devdas et al. 
2009). Franke et al. (2005) observed that the hyper-spectral imaging was more 
effective than the multispectral approaches for the detection of leaf rust. The 
system for the detection of plant diseases and infection-related damages in 
crops could be further improved by combining spectral and spatial information 
provided by image analysis facilities. Bravo et al. (2004) succeeded to detect 
yellow rust on winter wheat with a very high accuracy of only 5–6% error rate 
with the help of combined hyper-spectral and fluorescence image analysis 
(Nilsson 1995). Wiwart et al. (2001) found a high correlation between the 
hue saturation intensity (HSI) color components of RGB (red, green, and blue) 
images and the Fusarium disease-reduced thousand seed mass of healthy and 
infected wheat. Employing a model-based statistical analysis of NIR spectra, 
mold-damaged wheat kernels could be separated with an accuracy of 95% 
(Delwiche 2003). Peiris et al. (2009) and Dowell et al. (1999) successfully 
applied spectral analyses in the NIR range to determine the DON 
(deoxynivalenol, a mycotoxin) content of Fusarium-infected grains. Polder 
et al. (2005) subsequently analyzed spectral information of transmission spec￾tral imaging in both VIS and NIR range and Fusarium culmorum DNA content 
by PLS (partial least square modeling). Up to now, research on Fusarium 
infection was mainly focused on very basic approaches to detect this fungal 
disease in cereal kernels. Early analysis of potential crop infection by spectral 
imaging may, indeed, provide the means to fulfill these demands. The spectro￾scopic and imaging technology could be integrated with an autonomous agri￾cultural vehicle for reliable and real-time plant disease detection to achieve 
superior plant disease control and management. 
(ii) Fluorescence imaging is an advancement of fluorescence spectroscopy, where 
fluorescence images (rather than single spectra) are obtained using a camera. A 
xenon or halogen lamp is used as a UV light source for fluorescence excitation, 
and the fluorescence at specific wavelengths is recorded using the charge￾coupled device (CCD)-based camera system (Bravo et al. 2004). The chloro￾phyll fluorescence imaging can be an effective tool in monitoring leaf diseases 
(Chaerle et al. 2004; Scharte et al. 2005; Lenk et al. 2007). Chaerle et al. (2004) 
used blue-green fluorescence to evaluate the effectiveness of this technique in 
observing the development of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection in tobacco 
plants. 
(iii) Fluorescence spectroscopy refers to a type of spectroscopic method, where the 
fluorescence from the object of interest is measured after excitation with a beam 
of light (usually ultraviolet spectra). Belasque Jr et al. (2008) employed fluo￾rescence spectroscopy to detect stress caused by citrus canker (bacterial disease11.2 Monitoring Weather 107
caused by Xanthomonas citri and X. axonopodis pv. citri) and mechanical 
injury. 
(iv) Visible and infrared spectroscopy has been used as a rapid, noninvasive, and 
cost-effective method for the detection of plant diseases. The visible and 
infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectra are known to provide the 
maximum information on the physiological stress levels in the plants 
(Muhammed and Larsolle 2003; Muhammed 2005; Xu et al. 2007) and thus, 
some of these wavebands specific to a disease can be used to detect plant 
diseases (West et al. 2003), even before the symptoms are visible. In general, 
visible spectroscopy is used for disease detection in plants in combination with 
infrared spectroscopy (Malthus and Madeira 1993; Bravo et al. 2003). 
(v) Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Plants produce large 
number of secondary metabolites to interact with beneficial or harmful 
organisms. Secondary metabolites may provide plant resistance. NMR-based 
metabolomics has been used to identify candidate compounds for host resis￾tance. It offers noninvasive analysis of metabolites in crude plant extract or in 
intact tissues. NMR spectra are specific for every single compound. NMR 
spectroscopy measures the resonance of magnetic nuclei such as 1 H, 13 C, and 
15 N. NMR method provides access to both qualitative as well as quantitative 
information of the signal compound. For the identification of metabolites, 
database of NMR spectra of common plant metabolite is needed (Leiss 
et al. 2011). 
Profiling of Plant Volatile Organic Compounds for Disease Detection. The 
volatile organic compounds (VOC) released by plants and trees contribute about 
two-thirds of the total VOC emissions present in the atmosphere (Guenther 1997). 
Prithiviraj et al. (2004) assessed the variability in the volatiles released from onion 
bulbs infected with bacterial (Erwinia carotovora causing soft rot) and fungal 
species (Fusarium oxysporum and Botrytis allii causing basal and neck rots) using 
HAPSITE, commercial portable GC–MS (Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry) 
instrument. The study indicated that 25 volatile compounds (among the 59 consis￾tently detected compounds) released from onion can be used to identify the disease 
based on VOC profiling. 
11.2 Monitoring Weather 
The weather parameters have an overriding effect on disease development. Thus, 
weather has been the most critical factor in disease monitoring and forecasting. 
Weather is routinely recorded by government agencies, State Agricultural 
universities, and Krishi Vigan Kendras (Extension center) in India and is used, 
along with satellite photos and other data sources, for broad-scale weather 
forecasting. But the microclimate, i.e., the weather within the crop has a more direct 
impact on disease than broad-scale weather. A variety of devices has been employed 
for monitoring microclimatic factors such as duration of leaf wetness andtemperature that influence greatly the plant disease development. In recent times, the 
development of electronic monitors for many aspects of microclimate, along with 
compact and reliable electronic data recorders, has been highly advantageous for 
monitoring the microclimatic factors that are crucial for particular diseases. With 
further development, these devices will become sufficiently cheap and compact for 
widespread use on individual farms, resulting into very accurate monitoring of 
particular fields. 
108 11 Disease Detection: Imaging Technology and Remote Sensing
11.3 Microprocessor-Based Data Recording System 
As mentioned above, the field study of plant diseases usually requires equipment to 
monitor environmental parameters. The instruments that are used in present day have 
increased in technical sophistication from the clockwork-driven chart types to more 
recent microprocessor-based equipment. The disease warning systems are 
programmed to predict the response of the pathogen to prevailing weather conditions 
from previously derived epidemiological data. There are some models that have 
been formulated to monitor disease progress as a function of climatic influences. In 
order to predict the disease incidence quantitatively in individual orchards from 
flowering to fruit set, it was necessary to adopt an in-field computer system that not 
only acts as a data storage facility for the large quantities of climatic data required but 
also computes infection levels. In field, data recording was also required for daily 
updates of disease predictions and weather data. With such systems, the timing of 
fungicide applications can be more precise and unnecessary spray applications 
during periods when environmental conditions do not favor the growth of the 
pathogen can be avoided. Microprocessor systems for disease warning are used for 
the prediction of a number of diseases including apple scab caused by Venturia 
inaequalis (Cke.) Wint. (Jones et al. 1980, 1984) and potato late blight caused by 
Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Barry (MacKenzie 1981). 
11.4 On Farm Weather Station 
For forecasting, plant diseases importance and necessity of weather data can hardly 
be overemphasized. Actual weather on the ground varies a lot, even over a few 
kilometers. And even a few degrees of difference in temperature or millimeters of 
rainfall can have huge effects on disease outbreak. This is where the on-farm weather 
station comes in handy. For accurate disease prediction and making more effective 
IPM strategy having accurate weather data is prerequisite. Today’s weather sensors 
and stations are largely digital and can feed information to a personal computer or 
mobile device instantly. 
A list of a few major components and features of on-farm weather station is 
presented here.11.7 The Data-Logger 109
11.5 Components of Weather Stations 
Anemometer—Measures wind direction and speed. 
Thermometer—Measures atmospheric temperature. 
Hygrometer—Measures relative humidity using a percentage measure of water 
vapor in the air. 
Barometer—Measures atmospheric pressure to predict precipitation. 
Rain Gauge—Measures liquid precipitation using an open container. They usu￾ally empty automatically and measure the amount of rainfall over a given time 
interval. 
Pyranometer—Measures solar radiation levels from the sun in watts per square 
meter (used to calculate “evapotranspiration,” the rate at which water evaporates 
from the soil). 
UV Sensor—Measures UV rays from the sun. These sensors are used for 
precision growing in particular crops like cannabis, where overexposure to UV 
rays can stunt leaf growth or affect potency. 
Leaf Wetness Sensor—Measures surface moisture of the plants on a scale of 0–15 
(dry to saturated). Data from these sensors are used in fungal disease control. 
Soil Moisture Sensor—Measures water levels in the soil. 
Soil Temperature Sensor—Monitors the soil temperature to detect freezing, or 
high temperatures that can put crops at risk. Also used to calculate the rate of 
evapotranspiration. 
11.6 Automatic Weather Station 
An automatic weather station (AWS) is an automated version of the traditional 
weather station, either to save human labor or to enable measurements from remote 
areas. An AWS will typically consist of a weather-proof enclosure containing the 
data logger, rechargeable battery, telemetry, and the meteorological sensors with an 
attached solar panel or wind turbine and mounted upon a mast. 
11.7 The Data-Logger 
The data-logger is the heart of the Automatic Weather Station. 
The main functions of a data-logger are: 
1. Measurement: The data-logger collects the information from every sensor and 
archives it. 
2. Calculation: The data-logger processes most of the meteorological data for the 
users (avg, min, and max). 
3. Data storage: The data-logger saves all the data either on its own memory or on 
uSD memory card.110 11 Disease Detection: Imaging Technology and Remote Sensing
4. Power supply: The data-logger manages the power supply of the Automatic 
Weather Station, using a solar panel for instance. 
5. Communication: The data-logger manages the communication protocols with the 
remote server. 
11.8 Mast 
Usually, the 3 m (9.8 ft.) mast is used for the measurement of parameters that affect 
crops. 
11.9 Power Supply 
Many stations with lower power equipment usually use one or more solar panels 
connected with one or more rechargeable batteries. The output from the solar panels 
may be supplemented by a wind turbine to provide power during periods of poor 
sunlight, or by direct connection to the local electrical grid. 
11.10 Remote Sensing 
Plant protection involves the correct and timely identification and control of 
diseases. The identification of diseases is a difficult task and often requires consulta￾tion with specialists. An accurate and rapid diagnosis can avoid costly mistakes by 
timely applications of appropriate management practices. 
Assessment of crop disease damage is typically determined using field scouting, 
which is expensive, time-consuming, and difficult for large farms. Field scouting is 
usually conducted on a weekly interval, and treatments are applied if disease is 
detected. For large-scale operations, conventional ground scouting is incapable of 
providing efficient disease monitoring in an economical manner. Remote sensing has 
the potential to detect crop diseases for large-scale operations in a rapid and spatially 
specific manner. Remote sensing permits to obtain information about an object/a 
phenomenon through the analysis of data obtained through sensory devices without 
being in physical contact with that object. In the 1970s, the well-known Land sat 
series of satellites was in use for biomass sensing and crop/soil moisture sensing, 
based on spectral analysis of the solar radiation reflected by plants and soils. As the 
performance of radiation sensors has improved, satellite and airborne receivers have 
provided increasingly detailed information on the reflected spectra, while fast digital 
processing of their output data, coupled with data fusion techniques, has led to a 
variety of powerful, thematic mapping presentations. The maximum size of the 
image pixels has reduced and can now be 10 m, or less, in the case of satellite and 
aircraft platforms. 
Remote sensing has an interdisciplinary approach. It efficiently detects the 
anomalous locations within a field or orchard that have been differentially affectedby weeds, diseases, or arthropod pests (Hatfield and Pinter 1993). In fact, earlier 
scientists were using aerial color-infrared photography for this purpose and relating 
their findings to laboratory spectra of pest-damaged leaves (Hart and Meyer 1968). 
11.10 Remote Sensing 111
Table 11.1 The spectral regions used in satellite-based remote sensing 
Region Wavelength Property 
Visible (blue, red, green) 0.4–0.7 mm Reflectance 
Reflective infrared 0.7–3.0 mm Reflectance 
Thermal infrared 3.0–15.0 mm Radiative temperature 
Microwave 0.1–30 cm Brightness temperature 
The symptoms of plant diseases like rust and wilt can be related to changes in leaf 
pigments, internal leaf structure, and moisture. Chlorophyll degradation and 
alterations in the vascular system of the crop plants profoundly influence the 
reflectance patterns. Thus, spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) that focus on one or 
more attributes associated with these symptoms could be useful for the identification 
of the diseased plants. The spectral regions used in satellite-based remote sensing are 
presented in Table 11.1. Leaf reflectance of sunlight in the visible (VIS, 
400–700 nm), near-infrared (NIR, 700–1100 nm), and short-wave infrared (SWIR, 
1100–2500 nm) are dependent on multiple interactions. The VIS range is 
characterized by low reflectance, due to absorption by photoactive plant pigments. 
Observations made on the rust-affected plants of Vigna spp revealed increased 
reflectance in red region due to the degradation of chlorophyll by brown-colored 
pustules on the leaf surface. This was also accompanied by a significant reduction in 
the reflectance in the near-infrared bands and increase in the water absorption 
regions due to the disruption of vascular tissues. This information is useful for 
developing spectral indices that would be highly associated with the incidence and 
severity of plant diseases. Similar observations were made in response to the 
incidence of orange rust of sugarcane. 
The pathogen often induces several physiological changes in plant metabolism 
which manifest as disease syndrome (Apan et al. 2005; Nilsson 1995; Oerke et al. 
2006). The impact of plant diseases on the physiology and phenology of plants, 
however, varies with the host-pathogen interaction and may cause modifications in 
pigments, water content, and tissue functionality of plants or in the appearance of 
pathogen-specific structures (Gamon and Surfus 1999; Jing et al. 2007; Pinter et al. 
2003). All these individual impacts may alter the spectral pattern of plants. Knowl￾edge on the physiological effects of diseases on the metabolism and tissue structure 
of plants is therefore essential for the hyperspectral discrimination of healthy and 
diseased leaf and canopy elements (Moran et al. 1997). The best results for the 
detection of diseases were obtained in the VIS and NIR range of the spectrum. 
Steddom et al. (2005) demonstrated that multispectral disease evaluation can be 
used effectively to measure necrosis caused by Cercospora leaf spot in sugar beets. 
Similarly, Yellow rust decreases the chlorophyll a concentration, which leads to an 
increase in canopy reflectance in the VIS range and a decrease in the NIR (Jing et al.2007). Bravo et al. (2003), using a quadratic discriminating model based on reflec￾tance, identified yellow rust infestation on winter wheat with a reliability of 96%. 
112 11 Disease Detection: Imaging Technology and Remote Sensing
Attempts were also made to measure increasing or decreasing disease severity 
with the change of reflectance. Cercospora leaf spot increased reflectance in the VIS 
between 450 and 700 nm. A shift of the red edge position was monitored. Reflec￾tance in the NIR decreased with increasing disease severity, whereas an obvious 
increase of reflectance in the SWIR (short-wave infrared) was measured. Powdery 
mildew caused an increase in reflectance over the entire range. This effect was most 
pronounced in the VIS, and minor in the NIR and SWIR. Sugar beet rust slightly 
increased reflectance from 550 to 700 nm, reflectance in the NIR and SWIR 
decreased during pathogenesis. But the spectral data have some limitations in 
disease detection. Most stress factors, such as diseases, nutrient deficiency, or 
water stress, induce symptoms with little distinguishing spectral characteristics 
(Stafford 2000). 
11.11 Remote Sensing in India 
In Indian context (Panigrahy 2007), the launch of the first land resource satellite IRS 
(Indian Remote Sensing Satellite)-1A in 1988, provided data from two sensors: LISS 
I (Linear Imaging Self Scanning I) with 72.5 m spatial resolution and LISS II 
(36.25 m resolution). Since then, a series of satellites from 1B, 1C, 1D, P4, and P6 
have been launched. Currently, more than a dozen orbiting satellites exist that 
provide data in a range of spectral, temporal, and spatial resolutions. Major satellites 
having optical multispectral sensors are Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites. 
Today, satellite-borne sensors are used that exploit the full range of Electro Magnetic 
Radiation (EMR) from visible light, near-, mid-, and far-infrared (thermal), micro￾wave, and long-wave radio energy. The capability of multiple sources of information 
is unique to remote sensing. Of specific interest is the spectral, temporal, and spatial 
resolution. Spectral resolution refers to the width or range of each spectral band 
being recorded. Each target affects different wavelengths of incident energy 
differently—they are absorbed, reflected, or transmitted in different proportions. 
Each band of information collected from a sensor contains important and unique 
data. The spectral region and its property have been highlighted in Table 11.1 
(Panigrahy 2007). 
11.12 Disease and Pest Management in Potato 
Panigrahy et al. (1999) successfully identified and classified potato crop using IRS 
LISS I/II data during 1992–1993 for major potato growing areas in West Bengal like 
Bardhman district with more than 95% accuracy. The use of RADARSAT Standard 
beam SAR data also resulted in more than 90% classification accuracy for potato 
crop in the Bardhaman district.References 113
Work carried out so far has shown the feasibility of the detection of potato fields 
damaged by late blight (Arora et al. 2004). However, the most important is the early 
detection of disease for forewarning purposes. In this direction, hyper-spectral 
remote sensing has a great role to play. Hyper-spectral can provide spectral informa￾tion in narrow bands of 1–5 nm in a contiguous spectrum. Studies carried out using 
ground-based spectroradiometer with the spectral range of 325–1075 nm have 
shown encouraging results. The optimal bands, in 400–1075 nm spectral range, 
for discrimination of late blight disease intensities, were reported to be 540, 610, 
620, 700, 710, 730, 780, and 1040 nm. This covered green, red, red edge, and near￾infrared region, whereas for lower disease intensity up to 25% the red edge bands 
(710, 720, and 750 nm) could discriminate the diseased plants from healthy ones. 
11.12.1 Tea Pests 
Dutta et al. (2009) monitored tea plantations in India using remote sensing 
approaches. The study applies remote sensing technology to monitor pest 
infestations, water logging, and also pattern identification in an uprooted section. 
Data were provided from the sensors viz. LISS III (23.5 m resolution), LISS IV 
MONO (5.8 m resolution), CARTOSAT 1 (2.5 m resolution), and ASTER Data 
(15 m resolution): Acquired from ITC, The Netherlands, LANDSAT (30 m): 
Acquired from Global Land Cover Facility, Google Earth Images: Acquired from 
Google Earth. The delineation of pest-infested areas was successfully done. The 
gradual spread of infestation was observed during 2001–2004. LANDSAT, LISS III, 
and ASTER could delineate tea patches into healthy, moderately infested, and 
infested patches. The percentage of area under healthy, moderately infested, and 
infested tea was then calculated. LANDSAT and LISS III could delineate the tea 
areas as healthy and infested patches but lots of interclass mixing could be observed. 
ASTER could delineate the tea areas as healthy, moderately infested, and infested 
patches. Therefore, high-resolution images like the ASTER, IKONOS, LISS IV, etc. 
should be used.

Classical Disease Forecasting Systems 12 
12.1 Examples of Few Well Known Forecasting Systems 
Attempts to forewarn the farmers against the impending onslaught of epidemic were 
initiated perhaps in the eighteen century, when F. C. Stewart (1897) predicted the 
break out of the bacterial disease of sweet corn on the basis of temperature prevailing 
in the “three critical winter months.” Since then, the development of disease 
forecasting systems has been an ongoing process and already forecasts for a large 
number of crops have been developed. The forecasting systems that were started as 
mathematical equations or models based on growth curves have been evolved into 
computerized knowledge-based expert systems and finally into today’s Web-based 
disease forecasting. Among the numerous forecasts developed, a few may be 
considered as classic. For some of them, 80 years have been passed since after 
their development. But still these are relevant to forecast correctly. Based on their 
intrinsic rules, various modified versions of forecasts to suit various agro-climatic 
conditions have been developed in later years. 
12.1.1 Potato Late Blight 
Late blight was a major culprit in the 1840s European, 1845 Irish, and 1846 
Highland potato famines. Thus, for historic reason, there was great urgency to 
develop a forecasting system so that the farmers are not caught unaware. Such a 
system was developed in Holland following the work of Van Everdingen (1926) 
who first proposed using a set of “Dutch rules” based upon the presence of dew at 
night, night-time temperature, mean cloudiness, and rainfall. The work was then 
taken up by Beamount (1947) and came up with a simple version of Dutch rule, i.e., 
“Beaumont periods.” The first personal computer-based model on late blight fore￾cast, NEGFRY, was developed in Denmark (Hansen et al. 1995). A system called 
“BLITECAST,” based on data collected by electronic weather monitors in farmers’

https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-1210-0_12fields, which is now widely used for predicting late blight world over was developed 
in 1975 by Krause et al. Recently, web-based interactive system is being used for the 
risk management of potato late blight. Thus, a great number of predictive systems 
have been developed to forecast the occurrence of late blight, perhaps more than 
with any other plant disease. A complete review regarding the chronological devel￾opment of late blight forecasting systems is discussed in considerable detail else￾where (Miller and O’Brien 1957; Fry and Speilman 1991).
118 12 Classical Disease Forecasting Systems
12.1.2 Apple Scab 
Mills (1944) first laid the foundation of a practical predictive system for apple scab. 
This system has established a rational basis for management strategy for scab. Mills 
system has been reevaluated, embellished, and updated by many scientists. In 1992, 
one computerized, weather-based infection risk model (Beresford and Spink 1992), 
which identifies the periods of surface wetness that pose a high risk of infection was 
developed. This was followed by the second model which is an ascospore availabil￾ity model. The model identifies the periods when large numbers of ascospores are 
likely to be released from overwintered apple leaves on the ground (Beresford 1999). 
These two computer-based models are currently used in the New Zealand apple 
industry to assist in the selection and timing of fungicides for the management of 
apple scab (black spot), caused by Venturia inaequalis. Both operate with hourly 
weather data and are currently available in the Metwatch TM software supplied by 
Hortplus Lt. Besides an expert system POMME has been developed and used by 
apple growers to manage their orchards. POMME advises growers about when and 
what to spray on their apples to avoid infestations (Roach et al. 1985). 
12.2 Some Other Important Forecasting Systems 
12.2.1 Grape Downy Mildew 
In 1993, Rosa et al. developed a simulation model, PLASMO (Plasmopara Simula￾tion Model) for downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola Berl. et De Toni) of grapevine 
(Vitis vinifera L.). For the model, the inputs are: temperature and leaf wetness for the 
inoculation phase, temperature, and relative humidity for the incubation phase, and 
the type of treatment applied. The model simulates the development of downy 
mildew on the basis of climatic conditions. The computer program has been devel￾oped to facilitate validation and further improvements and to allow direct model use 
in vineyard management. Similarly, the “Vinemild” (Blaise and Gessller 1989; 
Gilles 2012) is another forecasting program for downy mildew of grapes. It is a 
simulation model of the asexual life cycle and a host growth model and both are fed 
into a progeny/parent ratio model to give an output of the proportional diseased leaf 
area. The other input for Vinemild is crop meteorological data (hourly temperature, 
relative humidity, and rainfall values) and at least one observation of the populationof the proportion of diseased leaf area in a vineyard at the onset of an epidemic. The 
program can be implemented on a microcomputer and provides the necessary 
interface with the user. It is menu driven and allows interactive input of data as 
well as biological parameters. So far, the Vinemild model has been used as a research 
tool to investigate the interaction between downy mildew epidemic and crop growth 
and to understand the effect of fruit yield. Possibly, the aim of Vinemild needs to be 
changed to predicting when to apply fungicides. 
12.2 Some Other Important Forecasting Systems 119
Park et al. (1997) developed DMCAST, the third prediction model for grape 
downy mildew. The DMCAST model uses the parameters like the number of days 
required for oospores germination and primary infection when almost 3% of 
oospores are ready to germinate and also the environmental conditions required 
for primary (oosporic) and secondary (sporangial) infection. It assumes that 
epidemics are driven by secondary cycles following the initial oosporic infection 
event. Recently, Orlandini et al. (2008) applied agrometeorology to the analysis and 
modeling of plant disease development and creating a decision-support system for 
the operational management of crop protection. The inputs to the models are 
represented by the fundamental agrometeorological variables of air temperature, 
relative humidity, rainfall, and leaf wetness. Tuning of parameters has been included 
to calibrate the models for any possible behavior differences in the patho-system. 
The main outputs of the model are infection intensity during the growing season, and 
the timing of the different infection events. 
12.2.2 Wheat Stripe Rust 
Wheat stripe rust is the most important wheat disease in China. The prediction of this 
disease is significant for making control strategies and taking timely management 
measures to ensure high and stable yield of wheat. Besides the regression analysis 
method, support vector machine (SVM) method was used to predict wheat stripe rust 
(Wang and Ma 2011). The results showed that the support vector machine method 
can achieve higher fitting accuracy and prediction accuracy and that application of 
this method for the prediction of wheat stripe rust is feasible and efficient. In 
practical applications, the optimal combination of support vector machine (SVM) 
types (a powerful machine learning technique implemented through the software 
SVM-light. The software enables the users to define six weather parameters) and 
kernel functions can be selected to carry out the disease prediction. Therefore, a new 
approach was provided for the prediction of wheat stripe rust. Park and Wellings 
(2012) combined the grey theory and artificial neural network theory and established 
three combination forecasting models, and developed the web-based wheat stripe 
rust forecasting system using network technologies. Earlier Wei-Chang et al. (2008) 
established a model for forecasting conditions for the occurrence of wheat stripe rust 
using meteorological factors. Based on the degrees of wheat stripe rust occurrence in 
previous years and the meteorological data at corresponding periods, the methods of 
grey correlation analysis and fuzzy mathematics (deals with problems relating to 
ambiguous, subjective imprecise judgments) were employed to formulate theforecast model for four pathogenesis stages according to the time sequence before 
winter, early March, early April, and middle May. 
120 12 Classical Disease Forecasting Systems
12.2.3 Blossom Blight of Apples and Pears 
Fire blight a bacterial disease caused by Erwinia amylovora is prevalent worldwide. 
The pathogen infects many Rosaceous plants including apple and pear. The disease 
often appears in the form of a devastating epidemic. Several different systems for 
predicting fire blight outbreaks (Mills 1955; Luepschen et al. 1961; Powell 1965; 
Thomson et al. 1982; Zoller and Sisevich 1979; Billing 1980) have been developed 
from time to time. All of these models, however, deal only with the blossom blight 
phase of the disease and none are truly predictive. They indicate periods of high risk 
but could not identify specific infection events. The model of Thomson et al. (1982) 
was commercially available as the “Western Fire Blight” program on Envirocaster 
TM field units (Neogen Corp., Lansing, MI). But none of these models has been 
available as a computer program. Lightner and Steiner (1992) were the first to 
develop a computer model, MARYBLYT, to predict the disease outbreak at the 
University of Maryland. Since then, many prototypes of MARYBLYT have been 
developed. It forecasts specific infection events, identifies when they occur, and 
predicts symptom appearance for four distinct types of infections. In addition, 
infection risk assessments and predictions are generated in both real and simulated 
time, providing an interactive basis for logical decision-making in cost-effective 
disease management. The MARYBLYT model has been evaluated for the prediction 
of blossom blight in New Zealand since 1993 and has been shown to be accurate for 
predicting blossom blight. 
12.2.4 Coffee Rust 
Kushalappa and Eskes (1989) developed a forecasting model incorporating the 
factors that influence rust development. Fundamental forecast models were devel￾oped for coffee rust, following a systems approach, and involved the prediction of 
amount of rust from net survival ratio for the monocyclic process (SRMP) of 
H. vastatrix. Later, the significant forecast parameters are identified based on 
empirical or fundamental disease prediction models. In 1990, Kushalappa improved 
his model by incorporating significant and practically feasible parameters, 
establishing action thresholds for these parameters, and recommending fungicides 
based on action thresholds. Zendaya et al. (2006) estimated the intensity of a coffee 
rust epidemic. A simple correspondence analysis was used to show that a link could 
be found between certain production situations and the intensity of coffee rust 
epidemics. These links were illustrated by a segmentation tree, which helped to 
define risk domains and rationalize coffee rust control. Recently, Lucas et al. (2011) 
used nondeterministic learners to alert on coffee rust disease. Their baseline 
approach was to build an alarm function to learn a regressor that predicts incidences.They trained a regression support vector machine (SVM) with quite good results. 
The correlation between predicted and actual incidences is about 0.94 in a cross￾validation experiment. 
12.3 Indian Scenario 121
12.3 Indian Scenario 
In this chapter, a picture of the available forecasting systems in the country, their 
impact on Indian agriculture, the prospect and limitations of development of 
predicting equations, or expert systems have been discussed. 
In India, the first stem rust epidemic of wheat was recorded in 1786 A.D. in 
central India, and since then, many epidemics have occurred. In India attempts to 
develop a plant, disease forecasting system was initiated as early as 1925 when 
K.C. Mehata revealed the mode of recurrence of wheat rust in the Gangetic plains 
which was till then a baffling phenomenon. Mehata on the basis of trajectories of 
uredospores from the Himalayas forecasted the appearance of wheat rust at different 
places in the Indo-Gangetic plain. His work was continued by a number of scientists 
in the country with great enthusiasm. A team of scientists, namely, R. Prasad, 
L.M. Joshi, S. Nagrajan, and their associates (Nagarajan and Joshi 1975) further 
improved the system. The countrywide network of the disease monitoring through 
remote sensing and adaptation of efficient forecasting system virtually eliminated the 
menace of rust epidemic from the country. But till now it stands as a solitary success 
of the country in the field of plant disease forewarning system. Nevertheless, 
research work on epidemiology and prediction system has been pursued by Indian 
scientists. But mostly they remained as a matter of academic exercise and could not 
be employed unlike the wheat rust, in curbing a plant epidemic in large scale. A 
review of the literature shows that a number of computerized forecasting and 
Decision Supporting Systems have been developed in recent years and they were 
validated by limited field trials. The potentiality of some of the important forecasts is 
briefly mentioned here. 
12.3.1 Rice Diseases 
In the early 1970s, at the Central Rice Research Institute, Cuttack, the relation of 
meteorological factors on development of rice diseases in respect of blast, 
Helminthosporiose, and False smut was studied and forecasting systems and control 
measures of rice diseases were suggested by Padmanabhan et al. (1971). The 
investigations continued in the ICAR institutes for rice as well as in various state 
agriculture universities resulting into the development of diverse modeling 
approaches viz. neural networks and multiple regression for disease prediction in 
plant populations. Recently Kaundal et al. (2006) used machine learning 
techniques in forecasting rice blast prediction. They developed an SVM-based 
web server for rice blast prediction, a first of its kind worldwide, which can helpthe plant science community and farmers in their decision-making process. The 
server is freely available at http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/rbpred/ website. 
122 12 Classical Disease Forecasting Systems
12.3.2 Oilseeds 
Rapeseed-Mustard is an important oilseed crop in India. The crop production is 
widely affected by rapeseed-mustard diseases such as Alternaria blight (Alternaria 
brassicae (Berk.) Sacc.), white rust (Albugo candida (Pers.) Kuntze) and white rot 
(Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary) downy mildew complex, powdery mildew, 
and white rot. Kumar et al. (2008) developed an Image Based Rapeseed-Mustard 
Disease Expert System particularly which may be highly useful for the agriculture 
extension workers. A multi-location trial on epidemiology and forecasting of 
oilseeds was conducted at 10 different research centers under the ICAR Coordinated 
Research Programme. In the study, the severity of different diseases on leaves and 
pods of different crops were correlated with different weather parameters. Regional 
and cultivar-specific models devised through step-wise regression could forecast the 
crop age at which different diseases first appeared on the leaves and pods, the highest 
disease severity on leave and pods, and the crop age when disease severity reaches 
its peak on leaves and pods at least 1 week ahead of the first appearance of the 
disease on the crop (Chattopadhyay et al. 2005). 
Saini et al. (2009) developed a knowledge management system, KMSCD, for 
crop disease. The aim of KMSCD is to provide a knowledge management tool for 
efficient knowledge acquisition, storage, knowledge engineering, processing, and 
proper maintenance of knowledge that can be ultimately used by the diagnostic 
expert system. The development of the KMSCD simplifies the complete process of 
knowledge management by providing user-friendly interface to the domain expert 
for entering and storing the domain-specific knowledge to solve the disease identifi￾cation and control problem particularly for oil seeds crops. The system presently 
applies to the knowledge management of 25 prevalent diseases of three major oil 
seed crops of India viz. soybean, ground nut, and rapeseed mustard. Earlier Saini 
et al. (2002) developed another expert system—SOYPEST for the identification and 
management of major insect pests. 
12.3.3 Pulse Crop 
Recently, Devraj and Jain (2011) designed and developed an expert system for the 
diagnosis and control of diseases in pulse crops (Puls Expert). Puls Expert is an 
operational automatic diagnostic tool that helps farmers/extension workers to iden￾tify diseases of major pulse crops, viz., chickpea, pigeon pea, mung bean, and urad 
bean and suggests the appropriate control measures. The automatic knowledge 
acquisition system of Puls Expert provides user-friendly interface to the domain 
experts for entering, storing, and structuring the domain-specific knowledge. The 
knowledge base has been designed after examining the type and structure of theknowledge from different sources like literatures, books, databases, farmers, exten￾sion workers, etc. Puls Expert was evaluated by a team of field farmers and State 
Agriculture Officers and it was considered good. 
12.3 Indian Scenario 123
12.3.4 Mango 
Rajkishore et al. (2006) described a rule-based expert system, AMRAPALIKA, 
using Expert System Shell for Text Animation (ESTA), for the diagnosis of the 
most common diseases occurring in Indian mango. The objective is to provide 
computer-based support for agricultural specialists or farmers. The proposed expert 
system makes a diagnosis on the basis of responses of the user made against queries 
related to particular disease symptoms. The knowledge base of the system contains 
knowledge about symptoms and remedies of 14 diseases of Indian mango tree 
appearing during the fruiting season and non-fruiting season. The picture based of 
the system contains pictures related to disease symptoms and is displayed along with 
the query of the system. The result given by the system has been found to be sound 
and consistent. 
Reddy et al. (2009) prepared the vector maps using the geographic information 
system (GIS). The Fusarium favorable areas are mapped by using “threshold values” 
of weather parameters and geostatistical techniques. The result so obtained after 
layering, the favorable conditions for the occurrence of mango malformation were 
found only in certain pockets of northwestern AP and entire state of UP. GIS tool 
was found to be very useful for the prediction of spatial distribution of mango 
malformation at regional scale. 
Chakrabarti and Chakraborty (2006, 2008) developed the Expert System for the 
Management of Malformation of Disease of Mango (ESMMDM). It helps to predict 
the disease incidence and suggests an appropriate integrated management strategy. 
The expert system is based on the information generated from long-term research on 
the etiology, epidemiology, and management under both laboratory and field 
conditions. 
12.3.5 Alien Expert Systems Adopted in India 
For the forecasting systems of late blight disease of potato, scab of apple, and downy 
mildew of grapes, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) regional and 
crop-specific institutes have developed modified versions of the already established 
predicting systems making it suitable for Indian conditions. Jones et al. (1980) have 
earlier developed a microcomputer-based system to predict primary apple scab 
infection periods. This system has now been modified as per the Indian climatic 
conditions and adapted successfully for forecasting primary scab infections in apple 
orchards in India (Sharma and Gupta 1995). Due to the economic importance of the 
apple crop and the notoriety of the apple scab disease, the Reuter Stokes apple scab 
and de Wit leaf wetness recorder tests are also in use in India (Gupta 2000). Krauseet al. (1975) have formerly developed a computerized system, called Blitecast, for 
forecasting the occurrence of the late blight of potato and for scheduling timely 
application of appropriate fungicides. Using the underlying principles of Blitecast, a 
decision support system(INDO-BLIGHTCAST) has been developed in India (Cen￾tral Potato Research Institute, Shimla) for forecasting the outbreaks of the late blight 
disease in potato and prescribing suitable fungicides(Singh et al. 2016). Similarly, 
the North American Plant Disease Forecast Centre (NAPDFC) in Carolina devel￾oped the UC (University Carolina) model to provide continent-wide internet 
forecasting support by tracking the geographic presence and future spread of 
downy mildew pathogen (Main et al. 2001). Using principles and modern methods 
of related sciences a forecast system, Blue Mold Decision Support System, for 
downy mildew disease of grapes has been developed that suits Indian conditions 
(Kotte 2013). 
124 12 Classical Disease Forecasting Systems
12.4 Conclusion 
In different Indian universities, plant pathologists have generated plethora of data on 
plant disease epidemiology underlining the effects of different variables on the 
progression of various diseases. Even the multi-location-trial data over the years of 
a particular crop disease are available. However, these data banks are yet to be 
transformed into an expert system and to be put in service of the farmers. 
The awareness, popularity, and interest in modeling, derivation of equations for 
plant disease forecasting or construction and use of Web-based Expert Systems 
among plant pathologists in India, unlike the developed countries, are not very 
encouraging. Apparently, less understanding in mathematics and computer program￾ming of agricultural scientists and lack of appropriate instrumental facilities in most 
of the state agriculture university (SAUs) and Krishi Vigan Kendra (Extension 
Centre) are the main impediments. Besides the construction of the forecasting 
system is a rigorous inter-disciplinary field, employing sophisticated techniques 
and requiring a good knowledge of its core areas. But it is obvious that without 
the application of the disease forewarning technology, full advantage of integrated 
pest management (IPM) strategy could not be achieved.
