Contents vii Preface 
UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs) at United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are an internationally acknowledged 
directives. They recommend the use of green and environmentally benign materials 
and practices. Herein, green practices encompass green technologies, life-cycle 
assessment, green supply chain, cleaner and sustainable production, and green 
disposal. The scientists and technologists have taken an immense interest and are 
finding a way in following sustainable practices. The recent launch of the UN￾Energy Plan of Action toward 2025 has a double imperative- to end the energy 
poverty and to address climate change. 
This book displays a summary of the initiatives/efforts taken up the research 
community in-line with the UN’s Plan of Action. It aims at providing a broad 
review of the recent advances in the employment of green nanomaterials in 
fabrication of films/composites/aerogels. It has mainly focussed on the emerging 
applications that may contribute positively toward fulfilment of SDG 6, 7 and 12. 
The application areas include packaging, energy, and water treatment. The 
19 chapters presented in the book are divided in the following three sections. 
Section I. Food Packaging (Chapters 3 to 6) 
Section II. Energy Conservation/Conversion (Chapters 7 to 13) 
Section III. Environment (Chapters 14 to 19) 
The first two chapters focus on the fundamental aspects of nanotechnology. The first 
chapter highlights the importance of green nanoparticles with its structure, 
properties, and surface modification. It also overviews the progress of these 
green nanomaterials in packaging, environment and energy-storage applications. 
The second chapter discusses the processing and characterization of nanoparticles 
and materials containing such nanofillers obtained from renewable resources. 
The first section (Chapters 3 to 6) talks about the potential use of green biopolymer￾based packaging films (i.e., use of nano-cellulose, chitosan, nano-lignin, and nano￾startch) in commercial industries. It, in general, focuses on the properties of composite 
packaging films, essential for increasing the shelf life of packed foods. Recent 
advances in the field of antimicrobial active packaging and responsive packaging are 
also highlighted in this section. The authors have shared their opinions about the 
future research direction and hurdles that need to be overcome before making such 
biodegradable and sustainable material/films a commercially viable packaging 
alternative. 
The second section (Chapters 7 to 13), the bigger amongst all, has focussed on 
the energy conversion/conservation applications that look for the employment of 
green nanofillers in the materials. Chapter 7 reviews about the employment of 
nano-lignin in energy-conversion devices including fuel cell, solar cell, and photo 
catalysis. Chapters 8 to 11 summarize the recent attempts made by the researchers 
in replacing traditional (electrode/electrolyte/separator) materials with green 
ix nanofillers for electrochemical energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors). 
Authors have made a distinct comparison of the electrochemical performance of 
batteries, solar cells, supercapacitors, and fuel cells for traditional versus green nano￾reinforced materials. Chapter 12 explains the use of nanocellulose-based membranes 
for separating CO2 from biogas through mechanisms like solution-diffusion and 
facilitated transport. The scope of the chapter is more focused on the facilitated 
transport of CO2, which is extremely speedy and is possible only in the presence of 
moisture. Chapter 13 focuses some recent developments in NC-based aerogels for 
thermal applications such as thermal superinsulation, insulation of electronic devices, 
smart flame-retardant building materials, apparel industry, etc. 
In the third section (Chapters 14 to 18), authors have reviewed the recent research 
advancements in utilizing the green nanomaterials in membranes/aerogels for water 
treatment. The focus includes the removal of metal ions, dyes, organic solvents, and 
various oils from water. A comparative performance of such membrenes/aerogels 
with other materials and water purification methods is also discussed in these 
chapters. Authors have also shown the path for areas of improvement and its future 
research/industry prospects in water treatment domain. 
We expect that this current overview will provide the readers with a unique 
perspective on the rapidly evolving field of green nanofillers and its effective 
utilization in the packaging, energy, and water treatment sectors. Overall, this is a 
reference book for researchers and scientists who would like to explore newer green 
nanomaterials/processing/applications. We are very grateful to all the highly erudite 
and experienced authors and other contributors of the book for their enthusiastic 
effort, patience, and willingness to share their knowledge and expertise with the 
research community. We extend our sincere thanks to CRC Press for publishing 
this book.

1.1 INTRODUCTION TO NANOTECHNOLOGY – 
CLASSIFICATION, EXTRACTION, AND APPLICATIONS 
Nanotechnology is the study and management of matter at the nanoscale, where 
unique phenomena offer innovative applications, with sizes ranging from 1 to 100 
nanometers (Nasrollahzadeh et al. 2019). A nanometre is about one billionth of a 
metre, which is ten times the diameter of a hydrogen atom. To put it into per￾spective, the average diameter of a human hair is about 80,000 nm. Nanotechnology 
includes measuring, modelling, manipulating, and imaging materials at this length 
scale; it encompasses nanoscale science, engineering, and technology. At the na￾noscale, matter such as gases, liquids, and solids show unique physical, chemical, 
and biological characteristics that differ significantly from bulk materials. The 
standard rules of physics and chemistry no longer apply at such scales. Figure 1.1(a) 
shows the transition of characteristics of materials when shredded to sub 100 nm 
(nanoscale) range. Nanofillers are nanomaterials that are used in microelectronics, 
biomedical applications, sensors, coatings etc., due to their excellent electrical, 
optical, and magnetic properties. Higher surface-to-volume ratio makes nanofillers a 
good choice for coatings (Pourhashem et al. 2020). Nanofillers are also used for the 
transparency they can impart to the nanocomposites (Jlassi et al. 2015). Thermal 
stability, high surface-to-volume ratio, etc., are some of the other advantages 
(Shybi, Varghese, and Thomas 2021). Quantum confinement, molecular motion, 
energy quantization, and electromagnetic forces, on the other hand, become in￾creasingly active at the nanoscale. In short, when compared to other forms or sizes 
of the same material, its nanostructured form demonstrates different properties (Bai, 
Sabouni, and Husseini 2018). 
Nanotechnology focuses on creating atomic and molecular scale materials and 
products. It has the ability to improve energy efficiency, assist clean-up of the 
2 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications environment, and solve severe health problems like the recent pandemic created by 
the SARS COV-2 virus. Highly efficient nanotechnology-based personal protection 
equipment and synergistic antiviral coatings have been developed (Sportelli et al. 
2020). It is also claimed that it will be able to greatly boost manufacturing output at 
significantly lower prices. Nanotechnology-based products will be smaller, cost 
effective, and efficient in pre-treatment methods (Ingle et al. 2019). It is also, lighter 
and more functional because of the requirement of less energy and raw materials. 
The reaction from the experts worldwide is that it can may benefit mankind as well 
as destroy it. The American engineer who coined the term nanotechnology, Eric 
Drexler, has issued a warning about the development of “very powerful, highly 
deadly technologies” in his book “Engines of Creation.” Drexler envisioned self￾replicating molecules escaping our control that humans generate (Drexler 2006). 
Despite the fact that this hypothesis has been largely debunked by scientists, many 
people are concerned about the impacts of nanotechnology on human and en￾vironmental health. Activists are concerned that nanotechnology’s science and 
development will advance quicker than policymakers’ ability to establish adequate 
regulatory measures. Nanomaterials aren’t merely something created in the lab. 
However, nanotechnology has enabled humans to build materials that include na￾noforms that will help in developing materials or machines that can offer benefits 
when compared to conventional materials. The recent developments and the pub￾lication trend in the field of nanotechnology in the last decade is given in 
Figure 1.1(b).

Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources 3 1.1.1 CLASSIFICATION OF NANOFILLERS 
A given polymer/metal/ceramic matrix, when reinforced with nanofillers, will result 
in a nanocomposite with the desired enhanced properties of the matrix. The property 
enhancement effect depends on the size and shape of the nanofiller along with its 
dispersion and interaction with the matrix. 
Nanofillers are categorized as 0D (zero dimensional), 1D, 2D, and 3D based on 
their dimensions. (See Figure 1.1(c)). All dimensions of 0D nanofillers are less than 
100 nm. Some examples are fullerene, SiO2, TiO2, MgO, and Al2O3. Similarly, 1D 
and 2D refer to one and two dimensions of nanofiller below 100 nm respectively. 
1D nanofillers are mostly in the shape of tubes, fibers, or filaments. Some examples 
include Carbon Nano Tubes (CNTs), Cellulose Nano Fibres (CNFs). 2D nanofillers 
are generally in the form of sheets/flakes with thickness less than 100 nm. The 
examples of 2D nanofillers are Graphene/Graphene Oxide (GO), and Molybdenum 
Disulphide (MoS2). (H. B. Park et al. 2017, Akpan et al. 2019). When 1D or 2D 
nanofillers form a three-dimensional porous network structure in a material, it is 
termed as a 3D nanofiller system. 
1.1.2 EXTRACTION OF NANOFILLERS 
Nanofillers can be prepared through top-down or bottom-up processes. A top￾down approach refers to slicing or successive cutting of a bulk material to get 
nanosized particles. In this approach, the starting material is in a solid state. A 
bottom-up process is a self-assembly approach. It uses chemical or physical 
forces operating at the nanoscale to assemble basic units into larger structures. 
Natural biopolymers (carbohydrates, lipids, or proteins) employ top-down ap￾proaches to extract their nanosized structure. Alternatively, the bottom-up 
approach is used for chemically synthesized biopolymers like polylactic acid 
(PLA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), as well as microbially processed biopolymers 
like bacterial nanocellulose (BNC), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), poly￾hydroxybutyrates (PHB) (Foong et al. 2020, Meereboer, Misra, and Mohanty 
2020, Smith et al. 2020). A list of typical processes coming under top-down and 
bottom-up processes is displayed in Figure 1.2. 
Important top-down processes are described below: 
1.1.2.1 Thermal Decomposition 
This process involves chemical decomposition through the heat generated through 
endothermic chemical reactions. The chemical bonds are broken down, thus paving 
a way for the manufacture of nanoparticles (Foong et al. 2020). 
1.1.2.2 Sputtering 
Sputtering is a particle ejection method by the application of plasma or gas. The 
plasma or gas ions impinge on to the surface of the target material and release its 
nano-formed structure. These nano particles are deposited as thin films, which are 
annealed later on. The temperature, annealing time, type, and thickness of the 
formed layer will affect the size and shape of the nanoparticles formed. 
4 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 1.1.2.3 Pyrolysis 
The process of thermal decomposition of the precursor material to its nano-form at 
an inert atmosphere with very limited presence of oxygen is termed pyrolysis. It is 
generally employed to produce carbon-based nanofillers for which organic waste is 
mostly taken as a source material. The nanoparticles functional distribution is de￾termined by the growth mechanism of the nanoparticles based on the medium, 
growing size, and physical and chemical properties. Temperature, type of precursor, 
catalyst used, etc., define the nature of the nanoparticle formed. 
1.1.2.4 Nanolithography 
Nanolithography deals with the synthesis of structures at the nanometer-scale on 
various materials by the use of electron beams, lights, charged ions, etc. The in￾tended form or structure is printed on light sensitive material by eliminating ma￾terials on the surface. 
1.1.2.5 Spinning 
Spinning works on diluting polymer solutions spinning in an electric field with high 
voltage. Electrospinning is a method whereby a suspended drop of bulk material is 
FIGURE 1.2 Nanofillers extraction methods – Classification based on top-down and 
bottom-up processes. 
Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources 5 charged up with very high volts (thousands). The droplet produces a taylor cone, 
along with a fine bulk material jet of polymer releasing from the surface with the jet 
carrying an electrical charge. This jet may be directed to a grounded surface, and 
then collected as a web of ranging nanometers. 
1.1.2.6 Laser Ablation 
This process removes material from solid surfaces with the help of a laser beam. In 
nanomaterial processing, the bulk material is immersed in a liquid solution and 
irradiated using a laser beam. A high electric field is created because of the in￾coming laser light. This is enough to remove electrons from the bulk sample. Thus, 
due to this incoming laser, the generated electron collides with the atoms of the bulk 
sample, resulting in the transfer of energy. This transfer leads to the heating of the 
surface, which is followed by vaporization. 
Bottom-up processes can be classified as follows. 
1.1.2.7 Bio Synthesis 
This process makes use of bacteria, fungi, enzymes, and plant extract, along with 
precursors for the generation of nanoparticles. When compared to the chemical 
synthesis routes, bio synthesis offers an eco-friendly method. A big advantage with 
biosynthesis is that it allows nano materials to be bio-compatible; hence, it is very 
useful for bio-medical applications. 
1.1.2.8 Chemical Vapour Deposition 
Chemical vapor deposition is a method of depositing gaseous reactants over a sub￾strate. A very thin layer can be formed due to the chemical reaction that takes place 
when a fused gas contacts a heated substrate (Noorani et al. 2018). Recyclability and 
reusability are some of the advantages of this method. Uniformity, hardness, and high 
purity are the main advantages of thi methods. 
1.1.2.9 Sol-Gel Process 
This is a wet process where a chemical reacts with a precursor solution. Chloride 
and metal oxides are generally used as precursors in this process (Ansari, Sobhani, 
and Salavati-Niasari 2018, Catauro et al. 2018, Lin et al. 2018, Mao and Li 2018). 
Then, the precursors are sonicated, stirred, or shaken in a host liquid. The resultant 
is a combination of solid and liquid phase. From this, nano materials are recovered 
through sedimentation, filtration, and drying. 
Here, the focus is on the classification in terms of the types of materials used: 
inorganic, carbon based, and organic (see Figure 1.3). Inorganic fillers comprise 
mostly of metals, metal oxides (Foong et al. 2020), and nano clays. Metal inorganic 
fillers own unique opto-electrical characteristics because of the effect of surface 
plasmon resistance (LSPR), which is a resonance of the outer electron bands of the 
particles with light wavelengths. For example, gold in its nanoform becomes ruby 
red. Hence, the value of metal inorganic fillers is very high. Another type of in￾organic nanofillers is the metal oxides. Effectiveness and higher reactivity are the 
characteristic of metal oxides. ZnO2 and TiO2 are examples of some of the highly 
valued metal oxides. Nano clays are another type of inorganic nanofiller with 
6 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications nanoparticles and mineral silicates arranged as layers (Merck 2022). Nano clays are 
classified again, based on the chemical composition and morphology into different 
classes like saponite, bentonite, kaolinite, organically modified clay, etc. Organically￾modified (organoclays) are used in polymer nanocomposites. Semi-conductor nano 
materials like ZnO, ZnS, Germanium, Gallium, etc. are other types of inorganic na￾nofillers that are prevalently used in electronic devices. 
Carbon-based nanofillers are used in sporting goods, automotive parts, energy 
storage, device modelling, boat hulls, etc., and can be classified as Carbon nano￾tubes (CNTs), Carbon black, Graphene, Carbon nanofiber, and Fullerene. Graphene 
is a hexagonally shaped allotrope of carbon with honeycomb lattice comprising of 
carbon atoms in 2D planar surface and is about 1 nm thick. CNTs are nanofoils of 
graphene that are twisted into cylindrical shapes. CNTs have the highest tensile 
strength, along with elastic modulus due to the covalent bonds’ formation between 
the individual carbon atoms. Carbon nanofibers are also nanofoils twisted just like 
CNTs, but the shape is conical when compared to the cylindrical-shaped CNTs. 
Carbon black is another type which is spherically shaped with an approximate 
diameter of 20–70 nm (Foong et al. 2020). 
“Organic nanofillers” are those derived either from bio-based or synthetic 
polymers, being either biodegradable or non-biodegradable. Nylon, polyester, 
polyurethane etc. are some of the widely used non-biodegradable nanofiller mate￾rials (Shankar and Rhim 2018, Akpan et al. 2019). 
FIGURE 1.3 Classification of nanofillers based on the type of material used for extraction. 
Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources 7 1.2 NANO FILLERS FROM NATURAL BIOPOLYMERS – 
CLASSIFICATION, EXTRACTION, AND FUNCTIONALIZATION 
Green fillers fall under the category of organic materials that can be used in 
composites for multiple applications. They are used along with polymers for their 
eco-friendliness. Green fillers can be added to composites to minimize costs by 
reducing the quantity of binding materials or to make improvements to some of 
the mechanical properties (Mohan and Kanny 2020, Pandit and Gayatri 2020). 
Green nanofillers, which are biobased and biodegradable, are more focused for 
detailing. 
As seen in Figure 1.4, nanofillers from natural biopolymers are derived from 
plants, animals, fungi, algae, bacteria, and proteins (Xiong et al. 2018). Cellulose 
forms the most abundant group in the world, where as chitin is the second-most 
profound nanofiller. The properties and applications of some of the most used 
nanofillers are detailed in Table 1.1. 
1.2.1 CLASSIFICATION 
1.2.1.1 Nano Polysaccharides 
Polysaccharides are macromolecules comprised of sugar units connected by 
glycosidic linkages. They are the most abundant natural polymers on the planet. 
Plants generate several orders of magnitude of polysaccharide each year more 
than the chemical industry produces synthetically. Natural polysaccharides are 
synthesized for a variety of purposes, including energy storage in plants (i.e., 
starch), structural support of vegetal cells (i.e., cellulose), and as gelling agents 
that create the intercellular matrix and contain ions like sodium, calcium, and 
magnesium (i.e., alginate in the brown algae). Some of them are widely used as

1.2.1.1.1 Extraction 
Polysaccharides have crystalline and amorphous regions. To extract highly 
crystalline Nano Polysaccharide crystals (PN), the amorphous regions are gen￾erally removed through acid hydrolysis. The sources and extraction methods 
highly affect the dimensions, morphologies, and surface properties of PNs. For 
example, the H2SO4 hydrolysis generally produces sulfate groups on PN surfaces. 
This results in better dispersibility in water and lower thermal stability (Roman 
and Winter 2004, N. Wang, Ding, and Cheng 2007). HCl hydrolysis helps in 
getting high thermal stability, but the suspension easily gets aggregated in water 
and hence has very poor dispersibility (Winter et al. 2010, Yu et al. 2013). The 
low dispersibility of PN by HCl hydrolysis can be improved by the use of organic 
acids like acetic acid, butyric acid etc. (Braun and Dorgan 2009). Other methods of 
enhanced efficiency in PN extraction include pre-treatments (Yang et al. 2013), hy￾drothermal methods, ultrasonic, and microwave-assisted technologies etc. (L. Tang 
et al. 2013, Lu et al. 2013).

10 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 1.2.1.1.2 Functionalization 
The advantages of natural PNs over inorganic nanoparticles include availability, 
biocompatibility, biodegradability, flexibility, easy processability, low cost, and 
high specific strength. Therefore, research focuses on the utilization of PNs with 
physical and chemical surface modifications to reinforce all types of matrices. The 
main purpose of the modification, i.e., introducing more functionalities onto 
polysaccharides,is to improve the physical, chemical, and biochemical properties of 
PNs to adapt their potential applications. 
The numerous hydroxyl groups present on the PN surface help their fa￾vourable surface chemical characteristics, making them an important pathway 
for changing surface structure, controlling surface properties, and producing 
functional materials. The methods for chemical modification of PNs that are 
often used, as outlined in Figure 1.5, are divided into three categories: small 
molecule conjugation, “graft onto” strategies, and “graft from” strategies 
applicable to polymers. The major mechanisms involved are: isocyanation 
FIGURE 1.5 Surface modification methodologies of nano polysaccharides. 
Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources 11 (Espino-Pérez et al. 2013), silylation (Roohani et al. 2008), and esterification 
(Cranston and Gray 2006), depending on the surface hydroxyl groups’ avail￾ability and activity. The “graft onto” strategy follows the small molecule con￾jugation mechanism. But here, the grafting effectiveness is restricted by long 
polymer chains, contrary to the small molecules’ conjugation efficiency (L. Tang 
et al. 2013). Also, hydroxyl groups, which are present on the PNs surface are 
able to directly induce ring opening polymerization (ROP) of lactones [30] along 
with olefins’ free radical polymerization (FRP) to graft polymer chains based on 
the “graft from” technique. Controlled radical polymerization, also known as 
atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), may be performed utilizing the 
functionalized Br atom as the starting point by employing small molecule 
conjugation to import initiating groups. 
A brief introduction of nanocellulose, chitin, and chitosan, its extraction, and 
functionalization are discussed as some examples of PNs below. 
1.2.1.2 Nanocellulose – Classification, Extraction, and Functionalization 
Nanocellulose (NC), a polysaccharide, is a light solid substance derived from 
plant matter/bacteria comprising of nanosized cellulose fibrils. It is transparent, 
stronger than steel and can be made electrically conductive by using various 
chemical/physical approaches (Du et al. 2017). NC has lateral dimensions ranging 
from 5 to 20 nm, longitudinally the size ranges from 10 nm to several microns 
(Soutter 2012). Generally, NC is classified into three categories: (1) Cellulose 
nanofibrils (CNF), (2) Cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), and (3) Bacterial NC 
(BNC). Multiple types of nanocellulose forms can be developed using different 
methods (Phanthong et al. 2018, Pires, Souza, and Fernando 2019). The size, 
morphology, etc. depend on the origin of cellulose, processing conditions, and 
pre- or post-treatments (Nasrollahzadeh et al. 2021). 
NC can be extracted from cellulose fibers through different treatment methods 
like traditional treatment and enzymatic treatment of lignocellulosic biomass 
(Gupta and Shukla 2020). The extraction is obtained by a process involving two 
steps. First, the native cellulose biomass is pre-treated and, secondly, changed 
to NC by different methods like micro grinding, electrospinning, high-pressure 
homogenization, high-intensity ultra-sonication, micro fluidization, and steam 
explosion. Figure 1.6 gives a graphical representation of extraction of NC. 
The different surface groups of NCs created by different extraction methods is 
shown in Figure 1.5. Due to the hydrolysis of cellulose by hydrochloric acid, the 
hydroxyl groups are preserved but lead to less stable aqueous suspensions (Beck￾Candanedo, Roman, and Gray 2005). Surface hydroxyl groups of NCs may be 
effectively changed into carboxyl groups using a mixture of TEMPO (2,2,6,6- 
tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) and hypochlorous acid, which may be advantageous 
in accomplishing the subsequent reaction during the surface modification. 
Furthermore, NCs were prepared by hydrolysis and modification in a single step 
using an acid combination containing hydrochloric and an organic acid (acetic acid) 
(Braun and Dorgan 2009). On the surface of the NCs obtained, there are hydro￾phobic acetyl groups 
12 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 1.2.1.3 Chitin and Chitosan – Introduction and Extraction 
Chitin is an amino-polysaccharide polymer that forms the exoskeleton of crusta￾ceans, insects, and cell walls of fungi and is abundantly occurring in nature. 
Crustaceans are the major source of chitin, especially shrimp and crab shells. Chitin 
can be converted to chitosan through two methods – enzymatic deacetylation or 
chemical deacetylation. Chitosan is a fibrous substance that is used as medicine and 
other biomedical applications. Different methods have been in place for extraction 
of pure chitin as well as chitosan based on insects, fungi, crustacean shell waste, 
and molluscs. Generally, demineralization and deproteinization are performed for 
extraction by making use of suitable chemical methods because of the simplicity 
of processes involved and cost effectiveness (See Figure 1.7). 
FIGURE 1.6 From biomass based on lignocellulose to nanocellulose – Extraction routes. 
FIGURE 1.7 Extraction of chitin and chitosan through chemical methods from insects. 
Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources 13 1.2.1.4 Nano Lignin 
Lignin is perhaps the most prevalent by-product of the paper industry, next to cel￾lulose in terms of availability among renewable biopolymers on earth (Ragauskas 
et al. 2014, Demiroğlu Mustafov et al. 2019, Q. Tang et al. 2020). Because of its great 
features, including as regulated shapes and sizes, higher miscibility with polymers, 
and increased antioxidant activity, converting unordered and intricate lignin into 
ordered and homogenous nanoparticles has garnered a lot of interest in recent years. 
Drug delivery carriers, hybrid nanocomposites, UV absorbents, antibacterial agents, 
antioxidant agents, adsorbents for heavy metal ions and dyes, and anticorrosion 
nanofillers are only a few of the industrial uses of nano lignin. 
Bioengineering to change the structure of lignin and integrating uncommon 
components has showed promise in improving lignin recovery and chemical 
transformation in biorefineries. The versatility of composition of lignin monomer 
has been found to be beneficial in increasing extraction efficiency. Lignin 
feedstocks with unique features for coproduct development have been created 
via mining genetic polymorphisms in native populations of bioenergy crops as 
well as direct genetic modification of biosynthetic pathways. The structure of the 
changed lignin and direct bioengineering procedures for specific attributes are 
detailed thanks to advances in analytical chemistry and computer modelling. 
The development of biomass pre-treatment technology has aided lignin extrac￾tion and allows catalytic alterations to achieve desired chemical and physical 
qualities. 
1.2.1.4.1 Classification 
Five types of technical lignin products are obtained. They are – lignosulfonate, 
organosolv, lignin kraft, enzymatic hydrolysis and soda lignin. 
1.2.1.4.2 Extraction 
Lignin can be extracted or separated from lignocellulosic biomass (Q. Tang et al. 
2020). Physical and chemical properties of lignin can be changed with the different 
extraction processes involved (Upton and Kasko 2016). Molecular weight, surface 
properties, functional groups, and solubility (Kumar et al. 2020) affects the pre￾paration. In recent years, different kinds of lignin-based nanoparticles have been 
prepared based on various types of lignin through different methods, such as self￾assembly, solvent exchange, acid catalysed condensation, polymerization, ultra￾sonication, crosslinking, and CO2 antisolvent. 
1.2.1.4.3 Acid-Catalysed Condensation 
Two methods are generally adopted for lignin preparation (Figure 1.8). In the first 
method, the lignin nanoparticles can be obtained in the form of precipitates by 
adding hydrochloric acid into the ethylene glycol solution of lignin followed by 
cross-linking and water dialysis, which can be kept stable at a wide range of pH. 
In the second method, the lignin nanoparticles can be formed by rapidly adding 
HNO3 solutions into the high pH aqueous lignin solutions, which is stable only 
at low pH. 
14 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 1.2.1.4.4 Self-Assembly Method 
Self-assembly is a process in which an ordered or organized structure is generated 
due to some specific intermolecular noncovalent interactions such as hydrophobic, 
electrostatic, hydrogen-bonding, and Van der Waals interactions in absence of any 
external directions. 
1.3 OVERVIEW OF THE APPLICATIONS OF GREEN 
NANOMATERIALS 
1.3.1 GREEN PACKAGING 
Biodegradable nanofiller based composites have better gas/water vapor barrier and 
similar mechanical properties when compared to conventional materials, which qualify 
them for next generation packaging in food industries (Muthuraj, Misra, and Mohanty 
2018, Wu, Misra, and Mohanty 2021). There are two types of packaging in the food 
industry – active or intelligent packaging (“What Is Green Packaging?” 2019). 
Active packaging involves changing the internal conditions of packaging (Fang et al. 
2017). These conditions can be classified as antimicrobial active packaging, antioxidant, 
CO2 emitting, and CO2 generating active packaging (Figure 1.9). The intelligent 
packaging consists of small and inexpensive smart devices/tags which can store, acquire, 
and transfer information about functions and properties of packaged food. The commonly 
used smart devices in intelligent packaging are barcodes, gas indicators, RFID tags, 
freshness indicators, pathogen indicators, and time-temperature indicators. 
1.3.1.1 Materials Used in Green Packaging 
The commonly used materials for green packaging are starch-based biomaterials 
(corn starch), polylactic acid (PLA), biodegradable packing peanuts, mushroom￾based packaging, recycled cardboard, paper, organic fabrics like flax, recycled 
cotton, hemp etc. 
FIGURE 1.8 The different extraction paths of lignin-based nanoparticles. 
Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources 15 1.3.2 BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS 
Bio-renewable polymers have emerged as an attractive alternative to conventional 
metallic and organic materials for a variety of different applications (Le et al. 2015). 
This is mainly because of their biocompatibility, biodegradability, and low cost of 
production. Among the nano fillers from natural biopolymers, chitosan is vastly 
used in biomedical industry. Figure 1.10 shows the applications of some of the 
applications of chitosan nanofillers-based materials in biomedical field. Bacterial 
Nano Cellulose (BNC), Guar gum, Gelatine, etc. are some other biobased nano￾fillers used in biomedical applications. 
1. Tissue regeneration – This involves implanting artificial bone, artificial 
skin, and artificial cartilage for the purpose of tissue engineering (C.-H. 
Kim et al. 2018). 
2. Bio sensing – Cross-linking moieties are being provided by the presence of 
functional groups, thereby immobilizing biological response elements and 
thus increasing the mechanical stability. Biosensors utilizing chitosan-based 
nano composites are able to provide improved selectivity, conductivity, and 
detection of different biological analytes like glucose, antigens, H2O2, DNA, 
and biomolecules.

delivery, gene delivery, cell encapsulation, wound healing, preparation of 
contact lens, dental, and other bone implants, anti-bacterial textile manu￾facturing, bioimaging etc. 
1.3.3 WATER PURIFICATION 
Nano polysaccharides-based materials can be utilized as novel methods to eliminate 
different pollutants and contaminants in water, like organic/inorganic, ionic metals, 
and other pollutants from foul water (Singh, Yadav, and Kuddus 2020). During 
the green nanoparticles’ synthesis, natural materials (plants, microorganisms), and 
organic polymers (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) are involved actively. Green 
nanoparticles provide an alternative way to eliminate pollutants from water 
bodies (Ahankari et al. 2020). The application of green nanoparticles provides an 
economical, convenient, and eco-friendly way for wastewater treatment. 
Figure 1.11 shows the application of green nanofiller, BNC-based membrane 
for purifying contaminated water. The used membrane can be utilized again after 
regeneration through washing, which makes it even more sustainable. 
1.4 SUMMARY 
This chapter deals with the importance of nanotechnology with the focus on the 
environment. The classification of nanomaterials is discussed with more emphasis on 
green nanofillers. Green nanomaterials are sustainable and biodegradable and hence 
FIGURE 1.10 Applications of green nanofillers in several areas of biomedical field. 
Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources 17 preferred over nonbiodegradable nano-counterparts for their adverse environmental 
impacts. However, the synthesis routes are mostly done using traditional methods, 
which are detrimental to the environment. Hence, the synthesis routes for green na￾nofillers need to be further explored since they demand the use of green resources only 
(sustainable production), and the process must be cost-effective as well. 
An overview of some of the important applications – green packaging, biome￾dical applications, and water purification, will be detailed in the following chapters. 
The structure and discussion of each detail in this chapter is intended to provide the 
readers with insight into the following chapters to come.

2.1 INTRODUCTION 
A nanocomposite is a composite in which the reinforcing phase has one, two, or all 
three dimensions less than 100 nm. Nanocomposites are improved alternatives to 
conventional micro composites and monolithic materials because of the unique 
properties they offer. But, the difficulties in controlling the dispersion and dis￾tribution of the nanophase in the matrix make the manufacturing of such nano￾composites problematic. The classification of nanocomposites based on polymer 
and non-polymer, as shown in Figure 2.1 (Sen 2020). This chapter mainly em￾phasizes polymer-based nanocomposites. 
2.2 PROCESSING METHODS OF COMPOSITES INVOLVING 
GREEN NANOFILLERS 
Green nanofillers-based nanocomposites are synthesized by incorporating the na￾nofillers in the polymer matrix using several techniques such as solvent casting, 
solution mixing, precipitation, sol-gel process, spray mixing, extrusion, in-situ 
polymerization, hand lay-up and spray-up technique (see Figure 2.2) (Hetzer and 
De Kee 2008, Ates et al. 2020). Electrospinning, nanofiber direct dispersion, etc., 
are also used for the synthesis of green nanofillers. For the purpose of industrial 
manufacturing, simpler and fewer processing stages are desirable. In recent years, 
many new process like in-situ polymerization, extrusion, and melt intercalation are 
used for bio-based nanocomposites. 
26 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 2.2.1 INTERCALATION AND EXFOLIATION 
In the process of intercalation (Figure 2.3), the reaction between nanofiller-matrix is 
reversible and the newly formed compound is only slightly changed from the matrix 
structure. Intercalation causes the van der Waals gap between the fillers to expand 
but only to a limited extent. This process needs energy and is usually provided by 
the charge transfer between the nanofiller and the matrix (redox). The common 
reactions involved are – adsorption of the nanofillers onto the matrix, exchange/ 
insertion of nanofillers to the matrix, and formation of intermediate stages during 
the process in layered compounds. A good example is the intercalation of 
FIGURE 2.1 Classification of nanocomposites based on the type of materials used. 
FIGURE 2.2 Processing methods of nanocomposites involving green nanofillers. 
Processing-Characterization of Nanocomposites 27 montmorillonite (MMT) dispersed in the chitosan matrix (Gierszewska, 
Jakubowska, and Olewnik-Kruszkowska 2019). Here, because of the good mis￾cibility of chitosan with MMT, the well-ordered multilayer structure composed of 
polymer chains intercalates into the silicate layers. A recent publication explained 
the utility of nanocellulose intercalation in Ti3C2Tx-based MXene for improving 
the performance of pressure sensors used in health monitoring (Yang et al. 2021). 
Exfoliation is an aggressive form of intercalation where the complete separation 
of layers of nanomaterial takes place. For attaining this aggressive form, some 
extreme conditions are required. Some of the commonly used methods are the usage 
of aggressive reagents, polar solvents, thermal methods electrochemical methods, 
etc. (Yu et al. 2016, Roy and Singha 2017, Aruchamy, Mahto, and Nataraj 2018, 
Agrawal and Yi 2020, Bai et al. 2020, Li, Zhao, and Wang 2021). Most researchers 
in this field prefer exfoliation of nanocomposites since this morphology is expected 
to enhance the nanocomposite properties, with considerably lower filler con￾centration as compared to standard composites. 
The processing methods employed for producing polymer nanocomposites are 
briefed below (See Figure 2.4). 
2.2.2 IN-SITU POLYMERIZATION 
This process involves the dispersion of nanofillers into the matrix, followed by the 
formation of bonding between the monomer units of the matrix, encapsulating the 
dispersed nanofiller in the polymer matrix (Bharimalla et al. 2016). This technique 
of nanocomposite formation is very promising because of the formation of uniform 
nanocomposite, which is attributed to the close contact between the nanofiller and 
polymer during synthesis. This results in the formation of nanocomposites with 
enhanced mechanical properties (stiffness, strength, toughness) and heat resistance. 
(Ray and Sain 2016, Kaminsky 2018) in their study dispersed nanocellulose using 
this technique at low viscosity to different polymer matrices. This leads to less 
agglomeration and uniform dispersion of nanocellulose. A recent study conducted 
on the in-situ polymerisation of PBS nanocomposite with chitosan nanowhiskers 
(CsWs) displayed top mechanical properties: tensile strength of 77 MPa and 
elongation at break ~530%; much higher in comparison with PBS nanocomposites 
previously manufactured. Also, tear toughness significantly increased by a factor of 
1.7 through minimal CSWs loading. Similarly, in another study, (Cui, Tarte, and 
Woo 2008) reported that poly(methyl methacrylate) when incorporated with clay 
FIGURE 2.3 Phenomenon of intercalation and exfoliation. 
28 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications nanomaterials using in-situ polymerization significantly enhanced the mechanical 
attributes of the nanocomposite. Moreover, glass transition temperature (Tg) and 
decomposition temperature also increased in comparison to the pristine polymer. 
This reinforcement is attributed to the homogenous dispersion of nanofillers, which 
restricted the movement of the polymers and lead to stronger interactions between 
polymer matrix and clay layers. Despite all these advantages, the in-situ process 
also has certain drawbacks. In-situ polymerisation is possible only if the poly￾merisation happens in the liquid phase. Compatibility between the nanofiller and 
matrix is another area of concern. For example, the green nanofiller, nanocellulose 
is naturally hydrophilic, when dispersed in a hydrophobic matrix creates weak 
bonding at the interface. In such cases, a compatibilizer, which is a coupling agent, 
is required to make the nanocomposite usable. 
2.2.3 MELT PROCESSING 
The principle of melt processing is the conversion of liquid melt into a solid product 
(Kargarzadeh et al. 2018). The matrix material is first liquidized by heating it over 
its melting temperature (Bhawani et al. 2018). The composite can be moulded after 
the nanofiller is added to the liquid melt. This process uses fusible elements like 
gelatin, which are frequently separated from renewable sources, as the matrix, while 
most renewable chemicals can be used as additives. There are three types of melt 
processing methods for the production of nanocomposites- extrusion, injection 
moulding, and compression moulding (Parmar, Patel, and Bhatia 2021). 
The most common method for making thermoplastic polymer nanocomposites 
is melt intercalation. It includes annealing the polymer matrix at high tempera￾tures and then adding the filler and kneading the composite to ensure equal 
distribution. Due to the absence of solvent usage, this process is environmentally 
FIGURE 2.4 (a) In-situ polymerisation, (b) extrusion, (c) solvent casting, (d) electrospin￾ning, (e) layer by layer method. 
Processing-Characterization of Nanocomposites 29 friendly. Also, melt intercalation is compatible with a process like extrusion and 
injection moulding. Thus, this process is economical also. The limitation of 
this process is the negative impact caused by the temperature on the surface 
modification of the filler. 
The most cost-effective and preferred method of creating thermoplastic-based 
composites and nanocomposites is extrusion. Raw material is melted and driven 
through a melting channel with single/twin screws to make the required shape in 
the output block in extrusion (Ghanbari et al. 2018, Lomelí-Ramírez et al. 2018). 
Injection moulding of polymer nanocomposites is carried out in five steps. The 
first step is to make a mould, followed by setting up the mould in the machine. 
The third step is to pressure feed the mix by injecting the melt, followed by 
cooling and ejection. Because of their suitability for mass production, low cost, 
and practicality, extrusion and injection moulding methods are the most preferred 
manufacturing procedures (Dufresne 2018). The films produced using these 
methods have properties similar to casted films (Cheng et al. 2021). Polyamide-6/ 
organoclays composites exhibited the highest improvement of mechanical prop￾erties and greatest exfoliation when the components were mixed intensively with 
higher residence time. This indicated that the mixing of nanocomposite in￾gredients greatly affects its properties (Borse and Kamal 2006). Similar ob￾servations were reported for polylactide/organoclay (Pluta 2006) and 
polycaprolactone/organoclay (Di et al. 2003). A disadvantage of this method 
includes the degradation of material during processing, which might reduce the 
mechanical properties of the nanocomposite. Furthermore, bio extracts, volatile 
substances, and antimicrobial compounds are prone to evaporate during proces￾sing because high temperatures are involved (Di et al. 2003). With polylactide/ 
cellulose nanocrystals composites, when prepared using the melt-processing 
method, agglomeration of nanofiller can be observed because of the insufficient 
polymer wetting on the surface of hydrophilic cellulose nanocrystals and en￾hanced particle interaction. Moreover, due to intense mixing and high tempera￾ture during melt processing techniques, cellulose nanocrystal degradation 
might be possible too (Arias et al. 2015). 
2.2.4 SOLVENT CASTING 
Green nanofillers, such as nanocellulose, can be evenly dispersed in polymers using 
solvent casting and melt-processing processes (Sun et al. 2018). Water-soluble and 
insoluble polymers and polymer emulsions are the main three types of polymers 
used. Utilization of the hydrophobic tail and polar head can be done for the water￾insoluble polymers and emulsions. Basically, a nanocomposite forming solution is 
prepared by mixing all the required ingredients with a suitable solvent followed by 
stirring and heating. The solution is then poured on the petri dishes after which the 
petri dishes are dried overnight in an oven. Finally, the developed nanocomposites 
are peeled from the plates (Cheng et al. 2021). This method is very convenient and 
low-cost and does not require any sophisticated equipment. However, some 
drawbacks of this technique include difficulty in commercialization and large-scale 
manufacturing of nanocomposites due to high energy consumption, long drying 
30 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications time, and high moisture content. Inability to control the uniformity and thickness of 
the film are other major drawbacks of this method (Cheng et al. 2021). Similarly, 
(Hai et al. 2020) used the solvent-casting method to synthesize green nano￾composite derived from chitin/bamboo nanofibers. The prepared films exhibited 
improved mechanical and thermal properties upon nanofiller inclusion. This in￾dicated the successful incorporation of nanofiller into chitin matrix by the casting 
method. The solvent casting method is also used for adding chitosan green nano￾filler to make chitosan-graphene nanocomposites with improved nanocomposite 
properties (Cobos et al. 2018). Recently, a novel solvent-free procedure, which 
is derived from the solvent-casting method, was conducted on PU composites 
involving CNC (Kupka et al. 2019). 
2.2.5 ELECTROSPINNING 
Electrospinning is a manufacturing method to produce fibers that uses electric 
force to draw charged threads of polymer solution up to fiber diameters in 
the size of a few nanometres. It is an electro-hydrodynamic process that is 
the effect of high voltage on a polymer solution. A needle is taken and filled 
with the polymer solution (polymer +solvent) as per the required composition. 
The liquid droplets inside the syringe are connected to a spinneret. This helps in 
the shaping up of the polymer solution as droplets. This is electrified at a very 
high voltage, which changes the shape of the polymer droplet to a Taylor cone, 
thereby generating a jet. This gradually becomes thinned and elongated to form 
fibers. The formed fibres are then collected by a conductive grounded collector 
(Xue et al. 2019). The fibres can be of flat, hollow, or solid morphology ac￾cording to requirement. Electrospun nanofibres have been used to develop green 
nanocomposites that can be used in several disciplines such as drug-delivery 
systems, wound dressings, water treatment, food packaging, etc. (Topuz and 
Uyar 2020). The broad application of such nanocomposites is attributed to 
the ability of electrospun fibres to encapsulate antimicrobial agents, plant ex￾tracts, minerals, etc., within its matrix. The nanocomposites can be engineered 
to assist in the targeted delivery of bioactive agents, especially in the food in￾dustry. However, some disadvantages of this technique include the high cost 
of production, low barrier and mechanical properties, and lesser resistance to 
thermal degradation (Hemmati et al. 2021). Production of PVA nanocomposite 
mats involving the green nanofiller cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) is one of the 
applications (Huan et al. 2016). 
2.2.6 DEPOSITION/LAYER ASSEMBLY 
A thin film is created by depositing oppositely charged materials alternately 
with wash steps in the layer assembly method/deposition/layer-by-layer (LBL) 
deposition. Immersion, spin, spray, electromagnetic, and fluidics are some of 
the ways used to accomplish this process. The LBL method provides the benefit 
of strong interfacial interaction between the polymers by achieving homogenous 
dispersion of nanofillers in it. As a result, aqueous solutions can be used to 
Processing-Characterization of Nanocomposites 31 make multilayered nanocomposites with a distinct structure, thickness, and 
composition. This method is a simple one having versatility in the use of 
materials with the capacity to use diverse ingredients in large amounts while 
controlling the nanocomposite thickness as well (Saini et al. 2021). Zhao et al. 
(Zhao et al. 2020), in their study, compared the properties of alginate/cellulose 
nanofibers composite prepared using blending and LBL assembly. The authors 
reported that the LBL assembly-made nanocomposites exhibited less perme￾ability against moisture, high transparency, and smoother composites compared 
to the neat alginate. Similarly, (Olek et al. 2004), stated that multi-walled carbon 
nanotubes developed by LBL assembly have enhanced tensile strength as com￾pared to the composites developed using in-situ polymerization or mixing. These 
findings support that LBL assembly for the synthesis of reinforced composite 
is a viable option. Moreover, chitosan-based flame retardant nanocomposites 
(Kundu et al. 2020), nanocellulose-based (Bai et al. 2020) nanocomposites 
for desalination, chitin-based (Fard 2021) nanocomposites for scaffold manu￾facturing, etc., are some of the recent examples. 
2.2.7 SOL-GEL PROCESS 
The sol-gel process (chemical-solution deposition) is a wet-chemical technique 
for the synthesis of nanocomposites. Hydrolysis and polycondensation, gelation, 
ageing, drying, densification, and crystallization are the steps involved in the sol￾gel process in chronological order. The sol-gel approach is thought to be useful 
for altering substrate surfaces. The most significant advantage of the sol-gel 
process is the ability to obtain a large surface area and stable surfaces. The 
chemical and physical properties of the synthesized nanocomposites are affected 
by the applied experimental conditions. Even though sol-gel is commonly applied 
to metal oxide nanocomposites, recently, a lot of work has been conducted on the 
synthesis of bio-based nanocomposites (Thiagarajan, Sanmugam, and Vikraman 
2017, Kong et al. 2021). The advantage of the sol-gel process is that it can ad￾dress the mechanical strength problem, which is in place for bio-based nano￾composites. (Yan et al. 2007) synthesized plasticized poly(l-lactide) and silica 
nanocomposites using sol-gel technique. The authors observed an increment in 
the tensile properties of the nanocomposites with silica incorporation. Similarly, 
the sol-gel technique was successfully employed to develop and incorporate 
silicon/phosphorus into the epoxy matrix (Yan et al. 2007). However, in spite of 
all its benefits, this method is still not used in industries but can be expected 
in the near future with the research that is going on (Ansari, Sobhani, and 
Salavati-Niasari 2016) 
An example of dispersion of nanofiller into the polymer matrix through TEM 
and SEM micrographs is presented in Figure 2.5(a,b,c) (Park et al. 2004, Kim and 
Cha 2014, Ren et al. 2015).

Processing-Characterization of Nanocomposites 33 2.3 CHARACTERIZATION OF NANOCOMPOSITES INVOLVING 
GREEN NANOFILLERS 
Characterization is required to understand the different facets of nanocomposites 
after processing. Five important aspects are related to the characterization of 
any processed nanocomposite. The first one is the examination of the quality 
of filler dispersion in the nanocomposite. Quality is defined by the percentage of 
agglomeration of nanofillers and the effectiveness of the processing method in 
making the preferred orientation/alignment of nanofillers. The second is to de￾termine the effect of surface modification of nanomaterials on the characteristics 
of polymer composites. This is widely done to reduce the nanofiller-nanofiller 
interaction and promote the nanofiller-matrix interaction. The third is to check 
the effect of chemical reactions and filler modification on the polymer chains. 
Fourth is the analysis of the process parameters on the properties and morphology 
of the composite. Lastly, the application potential of the nanocomposite is to be 
checked. Table 2.1 shows the outline of the working principle, analytical purpose, 
and limitations of some of the most commonly used characterization methods 
for nanocomposites. 
The different types of characterization methods for nanocomposites are explained 
below, with references to some of the latest studies in green nanocomposites. 
2.3.1 SPECTROSCOPY TECHNIQUES 
2.3.1.1 X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a nondestructive characterization technique that gives 
detailed information about the crystallographic structure, chemical composition, 
and physical properties of materials. The principle behind the working of XRD is 
due to the phenomenon of X-rays getting reflected from the crystalline portions. 
This creates a diffractive pattern that can display the structural orientation of 
atoms. XRD is used to characterize nanoparticles of all sizes, and the observed 
differences in diffraction peak positions are used to draw conclusions about how 
crystal structure and cell characteristics vary as nanoparticle size and shape 
change (Vorontsov and Tsybulya 2018). Moreover, XRD analysis is used to 
examine the change in crystallinity, crystallite size, and lattice spacing in the 
nanocomposites with an increase in nanofiller concentration. With increasing 
crystallinity in the structure, the diffraction patterns show sharp peaks in the 
spectrum. Figure 2.6(a) shows the XRD of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), 
chitosan, and nanocellulose composite. Pure CMC film exhibited very low 
crystallinity and the observed maximum peaks were at 2θ = 23.94°. As the na￾nocellulose is added more, the crystallinity increases. This was displayed in the 
spectrum with sharp peaks occurring at 16° and 26° for the addition of 0.1%, 
0.5%, and 1% nanocellulose (NCL) into CMC film, which confirms the crystal￾linity offered by nanocellulose (Jannatyha et al. 2020). Similarly, poly (Vinyl 
Alcohol)/Guar Gum/Silver nanocomposite exhibited an increase in %crystallinity 
ranging from 48.9%–61.9% as the Ag concentration increased. This phenomenon 
has been attributed to the transition of the nanocomposite from amorphous to 
34 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications crystalline one due to higher nanofiller loading. Higher %crystallinity is also 
reported to reinforce the stiffness, hardness, and stability of the composite (Gasti 
et al. 2021). In another study, cellulose/Tamarindus indica nut powder (TNP)-Cu 
hybrid nanofiller films exhibited an increment in crystallinity (61.1%–72.2%)

Processing-Characterization of Nanocomposites 35 36 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications with an increase in filler concentration. This indicates the crystalline nature of 
TNP-Cu hybrid nanofiller (Kumar et al. 2021). However, cellulose nanocompo￾site incorporated with bagasse cellulose nanofibre followed an opposite trend 
where the crystallinity decreased (74.2%–65.0%) at higher nanofiller concentra￾tions. Possible explanations to this reduction include the penetration of solvent 
between the crystallite space and crystallite chains which increases the amor￾phous nature of the nanocomposite (Ghaderi et al. 2014). A similar trend was 
observed for polypropylene/nanoclay composites (Uwa et al. 2021). 
2.3.1.2 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) 
A characterisation technique called Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) 
is used to obtain an infrared spectrum of absorption or emission of a solid, liquid, 
or gas. It is used to detect the functional groups from the spectral bands of a na￾nocomposite, which tells us of the molecular interaction between the nanofiller and 
different polymers/biomaterials. An FTIR spectrometer obtains high-resolution 
spectral data over a large spectral range at the same time. This gives a huge ad￾vantage when compared to other dispersive spectrometry methods that measure 
intensity over a narrow range of wavelengths at a time. Zhu et al. used an FTIR 
spectrometer with a wavelength range of 4000–400 cm−1 for the characterisation of 
HS, nano-ZnO, nano-SiO2 powders, and nanocomposite films (Figure 2.6(b)). The 
hydroxyl group bending and stretching was displayed as characteristic peaks in the 
infrared spectra of nano-ZnO at 713 cm−1. Also, there occurred a characteristic band 
almost at 799 cm−1 for nano-SiO2. This proved the possibility of Si-O-Si 
bond stretching (Zhu et al. 2021). Similarly, (Nath et al. 2022) in their study 
synthesized tamarind-kernel powder (TKP). cinnamaldehyde, and halloysite loaded 
nanocomposite films. They observed FTIR peaks at ~3695 cm−1, ~3620 cm−1, 
~908 cm−1 which is because of the stretching-vibrations of Al-OH of halloysite and 
the Si-O stretching of the hydroxyl groups of HS. The nanocomposites demonstrated 
the characteristic tamarind kernel powder signal at ~1624 cm−1 and ~2922 cm−1 
which verified the successful impregnation of HS in the TKP matrix. In another study, 
FTIR signals of soybean polysaccharide (SPS) nanocomposite exhibited a change in 
the intensity and position after the incorporation/ZnO/microfibrillated cellulose 
(MFC). The initial peak at ~ 3308 cm−1 was broadened and shifted toward lesser 
wave numbers, which suggests the development of a strong hydrogen bond between 
FIGURE 2.6 (a) XRD of CMC, chitosan, and nanocellulose composite, (b) FTIR of hy￾droxypropyl starch (HS), HS-based film, nano-ZnO, nano-SiO2 nanoparticles and the

Processing-Characterization of Nanocomposites 37 the nanocomposite ingredients. Furthermore, the decrease in the signal intensity at 
~3308 cm−1 is due to the unavailability of -OH groups because of superior inter￾action between MFC and SPS. Other changes in the peak position were also ob￾served at 1030 cm−1 (C-O-C stretching vibration) and 1743 cm−1 (C=O stretching 
vibration) due to the intermolecular interaction between nanofillers and SPS (J. Liu 
et al. 2020). Similarly, shifting of the peak from 3425 to 3373 cm−1 was observed 
after TiO2 was incorporated into PVA/starch matrix. Hydrogen bonding formation 
on the surface of TiO2 is the primary cause of the shift (C. Liu et al. 2015). 
2.3.1.3 Raman Spectroscopy 
The vibrational, rotational, and other low-frequency modes of molecules in a 
complicated system are visualised using Raman spectroscopy. The identification 
helps to determine the structural, chemical, and physical properties of a molecule. 
The Raman effect happens when the electric dipole of a molecule interacts with 
photons of light, which is used in Raman spectroscopy. This interaction exploits 
the inelastic scattering of light so that when an incident photon of light from the 
spectrometer strikes the molecule, the scattered frequency is different from the 
original frequency due to the method in which the molecule becomes excited. 
The content and qualities of the sample under investigation can then be de￾termined using these unique scattered frequencies (Agarwal 2017). Raman 
spectroscopy of starch nanoparticles (SNP) – Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 
composite was taken by Wang et al. (Figure 2.6(c)) (F. Wang et al. 2021). The 
wettability difference in the composite was explored. Some low-intensity areas 
were observed at 709 cm−1 showing that an incomplete PDMS covering happened 
on the surface of SNP. This difference in wettability is due to the physico￾chemical properties of the SNPs (F. Wang et al. 2021). In a study, PBAT 
(Ecoflex) was incorporated with nano silica-silver-carbon to prepare a nano￾composite. The Raman spectroscopy of the composite confirmed the presence of 
nanofillers. The spectra showed peaks at 210 cm−1 and 605 cm−1 which were for 
Si and Ag respectively. The frequencies observed in 0.5%–1.0% nanofiller-loaded 
composite showed a shift in spectra by 3–9 cm−1. This is attributed to the mo￾lecular vibration of C-Si-Ag in the nanocomposite during excitation. These shifts 
suggest that no strong interaction occurred between the nanocomposite in￾gredients resulting in no new bond formation (Biswas et al. 2019). Similarly, 
in another study PVC/GO composites showed two peaks at 1341 cm−1 and 
1580 cm−1 which were because of the D and G bands of GO, respectively. Two 
vibration peaks were also observed at 1595 cm−1 and 1332 cm−1. Furthermore, 
the intensities of the signals of PVC decreased when GO was incorporated in￾dicating the intercalation of GO with the PVA (Moustafa et al. 2021). 
2.3.1.4 Atomic Force Microscopy 
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) works on the principle of scanning the surface 
using a sharp tip with the support of feedback loop to modify the variables required 
for surface imaging (“Atomic Force Microscopy” 2021). A conducting sample is 
not needed unlike in some of the other scanning techniques. This is because, in 
AFM, atomic forces are used to map the tip-sample interaction. Moustufa et al. used 
38 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications the AFM study to find the surface roughness of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)- 
chitin polysaccharide (CH) composites. White voids were visible across the matrix 
in TPU/CH blend pictures, indicating considerable surface roughness. This revealed 
that TPU and chitin were nearly incompatible. Subsequent experiments were con￾ducted by adding 5 wt% of ZnO-SiO2 NPs in the blend. Also, the roughness de￾creased (histogram height reduced from 70.81 nm to 49.10 nm). This also 
confirmed that NPs helped in achieving good compatibility between TPU and chitin 
and also the surface topology of the composite became smoother (Moustafa, 
Darwish, and Youssef 2022). Similarly, cellulose/ZnO nanocomposites when ana￾lysed by AFM revealed blister like bumps on the composite surface with the 
bump density increasing at higher ZnO concentration. The AFM images of the 
smooth surface of neat cellulose is shown. The presence of these bumps could 
be due to the greater phase inversion rate near hydrophilic Zn. The aggregation of 
nanofiller at higher concentration were also visible on the composite surface, which 
might negatively affect the mechanical and barrier properties (Saedi et al. 2021). In 
another study, polysulfone/ZnO nanocomposites showed similar surface irregula￾rities after ZnO was added while the polysulfone surface was smooth. The average 
particle width in polysulfone/ZnO was 10–28 nm, while that of neat polysulfone 
was 25 nm (Gaur et al. 2013). AFM micrographs of cellulose acetate/organoclay 
systems illustrating the phase and height images of the nanocomposites are pre￾sented in Figure 2.6(d). 
2.3.1.5 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 
The principle of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is based on the spins of 
atomic nuclei. Nuclear spin is a property of nuclei with an odd mass or atomic 
number. A magnetic field will develop around a nucleus because it is a charged 
particle in motion. When non-zero spin nuclei are placed in a strong magnetic 
field with the right amount of energy, they flip from a lower energy state to a 
higher energy state. The difference in energy between the two states is determined 
by the applied field. The amount of energy absorbed during this transition is 
determined by the nucleus type and the molecule’s chemical surroundings. 
Excitation or “flipping” of nuclei from one orientation to another is observed as 
an induced voltage arising from the absorption of energy from the radiofrequency 
field as the magnetic field is increased. On Fourier transformation, the time do￾main signal of free induction decay becomes the frequency domain signal. The 
area beneath a peak is related to the number of nuclei “flipping,” and the field 
strength at which protons absorb energy can be used to determine a molecule’s 
structure. 
Ali et al. used NMR to find the characteristic structure of chitosan (CH) and 
chemically modified chitosan (CH-TET). Five distinctive peaks were displayed at 
105, 58, 84, 62 and 75 ppm. Also, small peaks at 175 and 23 ppm were displayed 
for the methyl and carbonyl carbon due to incomplete deacetylation of chitin 
(Figure 2.6(e)). The triethylenetetramine molecule was used to complete the in￾termediate alteration, and its anchoring to the intermediate was confirmed by the 
elimination of vinyl carbon peaks at 128 and 137 ppm, resulting in the production of 
the final product (Ali et al. 2020). 
Processing-Characterization of Nanocomposites 39 2.3.2 THERMAL ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES 
Thermophysical and kinetic characteristics of materials with temperature are stu￾died using thermal analysis techniques. The thermal stability, char content, and 
breakdown temperature of polymer composites supplemented with natural/synthetic 
fibers/or nanosized fillers are studied using thermal analysis (Saba, Jawaid, and 
Sultan 2017). The commonly used thermal analysis techniques are explained below. 
2.3.2.1 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) 
TGA is used to determine the composition and structural influence on composites’ 
thermal degradation behaviour. It entails gradually heating the material to its 
thermal degradation temperature while measuring mass loss during the process 
(Saba, Jawaid, and Sultan 2017). Thus, it helps in finding the thermal stability of a 
material and the volatile components present in it. In the work conducted by Ali 
et al., thermal gravimetric curves for chitosan revealed a two-step thermal dete￾rioration profile from 326 to 350 K in TGA data (Figure 2.6(f)). According to the 
TG analysis of chitosan, a mass loss of 9% of the biopolymer occurs during the first 
stage, with the greatest peak appearing at 335 K. The loss of water as a moisture/ 
physically sorbed on the surface causes a decrease in the mass of biopolymer. The 
polymeric backbone of the biopolymer chitosan degraded from 551 to 601 K, losing 
57% of its mass, with the highest peak at 570 K (Ali et al. 2020). In the work 
conducted by (Zhang et al. 2019), the loading of TiO2 in chitosan biopolymer 
improved thermal resistance of the nanocomposite. After the loss of moisture 
(50°C–105°C), and breakage of intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds 
(105°C–230°C), the actual degradation of chitosan polymeric backbones and ad￾ditives takes place (230°C–800°C). TiO2 significantly slowed down the degradation 
of the composite due to the thermal resistance of TiO2, decreased mobility of 
polymer chains and strong interaction between chitosan and TiO2. ZnO and Fe￾MMT when incorporated into EVA films enhanced the thermal properties of the 
composite. This is because of the synergistic effect of the nanofillers, which prevent 
the degradation of the EVA matrix due to strong nanofiller-matrix interaction 
(Eskandarabadi et al. 2019). Similarly, when ZnS and TiO2 are incorporated into 
chitosan matrix, they exhibit a synergistic effect in enhancing the thermal stability 
of the blend nanocomposite (Jbeli et al. 2018). 
2.3.2.2 Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) 
The difference in the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a sample 
and a reference is assessed as a function of temperature in DSC, a thermoanalytical 
technique. DSC helps in the measurements of glass transition, cure kinetics, 
melting, and crystallization. It also aids in the identification of chemical reactions 
by providing information such as specific heat capacity, thermal history, thermal 
curing, and purity analysis. Due to the development of highly-functional polymeric 
materials recently, DSC has been widely used in the recent times, especially for 
polymeric nanocomposites, which are the area of interest for many (Ayanoğlu and 
Doğan 2020). 
40 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications Jannatya et al. presented DSC results of the Tg (glass transition) results of car￾boxymethylated cellulose (CMC) and CMC/nanofiller 1% treatments (Figure 2.6(g)). 
The results exhibited that Tg value of CMC, CMC/nanocellulose (NCL) 1%, and 
CMC/chitosan (NCH) 1% films were 206.31°C, 221.97°C, and 200.91°C, respec￾tively. Tg value was significantly increased when NCL was added. This is due to a 
high degree of molecular polymer ordering and increased crystallinity of nanofillers, 
both of which required energy to breakdown, showing greater thermal stability 
(Jannatyha et al. 2020). In another study, carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC), when in￾corporated with MgO, exhibited a reduced mass loss rate. Moreover, the melting peak 
of nanocomposites at the temperature range 250°C–310°C is quite smaller compared 
to pure CMC. This is mainly because of the superior thermal stability of MgO. The 
MgO dispersion in the CMC matrix acts as a hindrance, which obstructs mass transfer 
of CMC that effectively delays the weight loss of CMC (Y. Wang et al. 2020). 
Similarly, Tg of epoxy/graphene nanocomposites increased with higher graphene 
content (Shiu and Tsai 2014). DSC thermograms are also used to measure the % 
crystallinity of the nanocomposites effectively. In a study by (Frone et al. 2016), the 
authors observed that the % crystallinity of PLA-cellulose nanofibers (48%) was 
greater in comparison to pristine PLA films (40%) due to the introduction of the 
crystalline phase into PLA matrix. The authors also found out that the heating rate 
does not affect the % in the experiment. (Díez-Pascual and Díez-Vicente 2014) in 
their article reported that the incorporation of ZnO with PHBV considerably enhanced 
the crystallinity of the nanocomposite (~66.3%) as compared to neat PHBV 
(~55.1%). However, with higher ZnO content (8% ZnO), the crystallinity decreased 
slightly which is because of the strong interactions among the C═O of the ester groups 
of PHBV and the hydroxyl groups of the ZnO surface that might obstruct the polymer 
chain diffusion and crystallization process. 
2.3.2.3 Thermomechanical Analysis (TMA) 
The dimensional changes (flexure analysis) happening on solid or liquid materials 
as a function of temperature, applied force, and time can be found through this 
method. It also measures glass transition temperature (Tg), coefficient of thermal 
expansion, and compression modulus. Rubbers and plastics are the preferred choice 
of materials among solids since TMA generates only small forces, which are not 
enough to conduct an experiment on metals. 
Nasrin et al. conducted TMA on chitin-polylactic acid (PLA) nanocomposites. 
From the results shown in Figure 2.6(h), as the temperature increases, the PLA film 
softens as it goes through Tg. This expansion occurs because the film sample still 
contains some crystalline PLA. TMA of chitin-reinforced PLA (CTP) is described. 
Softening of CTP film started at 51.9°C, and the contraction continues up to 118.1°C. 
Then expansion starts and continues up to 137.3°C. This expansion occurs because 
the film sample still contains some crystalline PLA and then melts down (Nasrin et al. 
2017). Similarly, (Saba, Jawaid, and Sultan 2017) synthesized epoxy nanocomposites 
by incorporating nano oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPFB). From the TMA study, it 
was clear that the nano OFPB incorporated epoxy nanocomposite exhibited lower 
thermal dilatations as compared to neat epoxy composite in the rubbery or glassy 
regions. This indicated the enhanced dimensional stability from the coefficient of 
Processing-Characterization of Nanocomposites 41 linear thermal expansion (CTE) of the nanocomposites, which translated to the pre￾sence of synergy between epoxy and nano OFPB. However, when the OPFB con￾centration is 5%, the CTE increases, which can be attributed to the formation of 
aggregates and poor dispersion of nano OPFB that creates free zone for polymer 
segmental motion. The opposite was observed at lower OPFB concentrations (3%), 
where the CTE decreased due to better interfacial bond and reduced polymer seg￾mental motion. These results also indicated enhanced mechanical properties for 
epoxy/(3%) OPFB nanocomposites. A similar reduction in CTE was obtained for 
epoxy/graphene oxide, as compared to pure graphene flakes (Shiu and Tsai 2014). 
2.3.2.4 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) 
DMA is used to find tension, dual cantilever bending, and shear, 3-point bending 
etc of polymers. Viscoelastic properties like storage modulus, loss modulus, and 
tangent modulus and their dependence on frequency and temperature can also be 
found. By measuring temperature dispersion and frequency dispersion simulta￾neously, relaxation phenomena such as glass transition, side-chain relaxation, and 
local mode relaxation can be seen. 
The dynamic, mechanical analysis of poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) 
PBAT and PBAT-30% NC (nano chitin) at two different testing frequencies 
(1000 Hz, 5000 Hz) and between the temperature windows −80°C to +80°C are 
shown in Figure 2.6(i). Because of the presence of nanofiller, the Tg did not appear to 
change considerably in this experiment. However, the presence of the filler causes the 
storage and loss modulus to increase dramatically, which is particularly noticeable 
at lower temperatures (Sadhasivam, Ramamoorthy, and Dhamodharan 2020). 
2.3.2.5 Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) 
DTA is a technique where the temperature difference between sample and reference 
material is visualised against time/temperature. The sample material temperature is 
heated at a programmed rate for achieving this. It helps in identifying the chemical 
composition of substances by monitoring the thermal behaviour of a sample as it is 
heated. In a recent study conducted on the DTA analysis of chitosan-polyurethane 
nanocomposites by Javaid et al., thermogravimetric and differential thermal ana￾lysis (TGA/DTA) of synthesized polyurethane (PU) samples were carried out to 
determine the effect of diisocyanate structure on the thermal stability of PUs in an 
inert medium (N2 atmosphere) at a heating rate of 20°C/min. The study 
(Figure 2.6(j)) showed that, the use of chitosan and incorporation of clay in the PU 
matrix enhanced the thermal stability and prevented the thermal degradation be￾haviour of samples (Javaid et al. 2018). Similarly, in another study, graphene (GO) 
was susceptible to rapid weight loss during heating because it is unstable due to the 
presence of the labile oxygen group; the bulk portion of weight loss takes place 
before 288°C. Further heating to 1100°C resulted in 65% weight loss of GO. 
However, after TiO2 was loaded to form GO-TiO2 composites, the onset of weight 
loss was delayed by 50°C. This suggested that the presence of TiO2 stabilized the 
GO resulting in the delay of thermal degradation that is commonly noticed during 
the thermal treatment of GO (Lambert et al. 2009). 
42 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 2.3.3 MICROSCOPY TECHNIQUES 
2.3.3.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) 
SEM is the most used microscopy technique for the characterization of materials 
structure. The resolution is in the range of 1–5 nm. The depth of field is very 
large, and a 3D image is also possible. SEM works on the principle of the gen￾eration of electrons by an electron gun. It is accelerated through lenses that help 
focus the beam. Nazeer et al. investigated intercalated chitosan-hydroxyapatite 
nanocomposites and found the formation of self-intercalated layered chitosan, 
hydroxyapatite nanocomposites (Nazeer, Yilgör, and Yilgör 2017). Kanimozhi 
et al. utilized SEM for finding the morphology of chitosan/PVA/methylcellulose – 
nanocellulose nanocomposites (Kanimozhi et al. 2018). In another study, Batool 
et al. studied the morphology and size of the newly synthesized Ag NPs. 
SEM was also used to examine the surface of nanocomposite hydrogel mem￾branes. The NPs created using organic extract had a well-dispersed spherical form 
with an average particle size of about 19 nm, and the NPs prepared through 
aqueous extract had an average particle size of about 24 nm (Batool et al. 2019). 
In another study of SEM conducted on CuO-bentonite-gold nanocomposites, 
Figure 2.6(k), (Apriandanu and Yulizar 2021) showed the that CuO and Au were 
formed in the bentonite interlayer. Both the shape of CuO and Au were spherical. 
A variant of SEM is the field emission SEM (FE-SEM) available with higher 
resolution and a much greater energy range. It works similarly to a SEM in that an 
electron beam scans the sample surface, while a monitor presents the information 
that interests us based on the detectors available. The electron production me￾chanism is the most significant difference between a FESEM and a SEM. The 
FESEM uses a field emission gun as an electron source, which produces extremely 
concentrated high and low-energy electron beams, considerably improving spatial 
resolution and allowing work to be done at very low potentials (0.02–5 kV). This 
reduces the charging effect on non-conductive specimens and protects electron 
beam-sensitive samples from harm. The use of in-lens detectors is another standout 
characteristic of FESEM. These detectors, which are optimised for excellent re￾solution and low acceleration potential, are critical for maximising the equipment’s 
performance. Ethylene-vinyl acetate-based nanocomposite loaded with rosemary 
extracts and Fe-MMT/ZnO was analysed with FESEM. The diameter of the na￾noparticles was around 40 nm, which corroborates with the XRD diffractograms. 
The neat EVA films were smooth, whereas the nanocomposite films were less 
smooth. The nanofillers were visible as fine grains with no cracks on the composite 
surface (Eskandarabadi et al. 2019). In another study, (Habibi 2014) analysed 
the surface of magnetite-carboxymethyl cellulose nanocomposite using FESEM. 
The presence of magnetite can be confirmed with the use of FESEM too. The mean 
diameter of the nanoparticles was around 35 nm, which corroborated the data 
from XRD. Therefore, both SEM and FESEM are used to analyse the surface of 
the nanocomposite to find any apparent defect during composite formation. They 
help determine if the nanofillers have been dispersed homogenously or have formed 
an agglomeration. 
Processing-Characterization of Nanocomposites 43 2.3.3.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) 
The high-energy electrons are passed through an ultrathin portion of the specimen 
in the TEM method. When the beam hits the specimen, electron scattering creates 
the image. An electron gun is used to fire the electrons (filament). Two or more 
condenser lenses are placed below the electron cannon to demagnify and control the 
diameter of the beam as it reaches the specimen, which is held inside an objective 
lens slightly below the condenser lenses. After the objective lens, there are two 
further lenses: the intermediate lens and the projector lens. Each one generates a 
genuine, magnified image, which is subsequently displayed on a fluorescent ima￾ging screen or film. Electron scattering causes TEM picture contrast. Pal et al. used 
TEM for confirming the intercalation/exfoliation of nanoclay in PHBV, as well as at 
the interface of the PHBV and PBAT blend matrix (Pal et al. 2020). In another 
study by Apriandanu et al., see Figure 2.6(l). The particle size of CuO-bentonite￾gold nanocomposites was determined using TEM characterization. The particle size 
of the nanocomposites in agglomeration was around 30 nm, with a spherical form 
(Apriandanu and Yulizar 2021). 
2.4 SUMMARY 
The processing of materials containing green nanofillers is challenging, but it 
offers a pathway to intangible applications in the areas of water purification, 
energy, biomedical, and packaging sectors. Some of the processing methods, like 
electrospinning and extrusion, demand high energy and produce emissions. Going 
green in processing methods also is a great concern to be addressed. The utili￾zation of renewable energy sources for manufacturing technologies is currently 
progressing. Upcoming advancements in ‘virtual processing’ technologies in￾volving computer programming have a good prospect since they can display the 
infinite possibilities in manufacturing before actually going for the process. This 
helps the manufacturer to go for the best compatible materials and methods for 
each application. 
The selection of characterization methods is another important criterion. Thanks 
to the development in the field of image processing and sensing technology, a lot of 
techniques are available now to find displacement, temperature fields, and strain 
during mechanical testing methods. Heterogeneities in the processed material im￾parted due to cracks, strain gradients, parasitic effects produced by mechanical 
setups, etc. can be detected. As stated in the chapter, many new technologies have 
emerged and found a niche where they can provide specialised performance, but it 
should be emphasised that only a few have matured into commercial goods, 
indicating that characterisation approaches have a bright future ahead of them.

3.1 INTRODUCTION 
The dependency on petroleum-based products has long sustained the packaging field. 
About 350 million tons of plastic waste have been generated worldwide every year 
(Ritchie and Roser 2018). The packaging field, particularly the food packaging area, is 
heavily dependent on petroleum-based materials as; it confronts many essential cri￾teria that should be properly tuned for the healthy and long shelf life of foods such as 
fruits, vegetables, meats, fish, etc. Nowadays, an increase in the awareness of en￾vironmental conservation and sustainability has encouraged researchers to focus on 
developing and fabricating alternative bio-based plastics for food packaging. The 
advantages of synthetic polymers, such as their low cost, light weight, low trans￾portation cost, good barrier properties, high mechanical and thermal strength, and 
shape versatility, make them attractive for packaging applications (Muller, González￾Martínez, and Chiralt 2017). However, these advantages diminish before the threats 
synthetics are causing to the environment, the cost of petroleum, and the depletion of 
fossil reserves. Hence, the thrust to rely on more sustainable bio-based packaging 
products is rapidly increasing, and researchers have turned their epicentre of invention 
to biopolymers, which could replace petroleum-based products. 
Food packaging is a web comprising different systems involving food processing, 
transportation, retailing, and preserving the food from external spoilage factors like 
microorganisms, temperature, oxygen, and humidity with optimal cost (Kumar, 
Mukherjee, and Dutta 2020; Marsh and Bugusu 2007; Shin and Selke 2014; Yam and 
Lee 2012). The threat that petroleum-based plastics cause to the environment can now 
56 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications be mitigated by introducing bioplastics obtained from renewable resources. 
Nevertheless, not all biodegradable bioplastics are obtained from renewable sources, 
including polycaprolactones, polyglycolide, polyesteramides, etc. (Haghighi et al. 
2020). The term ‘bio-based polymer’ refers to those derived from nature (Soroudi and 
Jakubowicz 2013) and biodegradable in the sense that they disintegrate into CO2, H2O, 
and CH4 by an enzymatic process of microorganisms (Peelman et al. 2013). The 
European Bioplastic Organization stated that annually 1% of the overall global plastic 
production constitutes bioplastics; among the produced bioplastics, 65% are utilized in 
the field of packaging. This number might be increased every year as consumer 
awareness of environmental sustainability is rapidly increasing (Rujnić-Sokele and 
Pilipović 2017). 
An ideal food-packaging material should meet different criteria, including low 
cost, high mechanical strength, good barrier properties, heat sealing ability, shape 
versatility, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, thereby providing food safety 
and the extension of shelf life for food. The food packaging materials should be 
called ‘active packaging’ or ‘active biofilms’ because they should interact with food 
while having the properties mentioned earlier (Hoffmann et al. 2019). 
Biodegradable polymers from renewable sources are now considered the future 
generation of packaging materials. These renewable polymers include proteins 
(like casein), lipids, and polysaccharides like cellulose, starch, chitosan, and agar 
(Fabra, López-Rubio, and Lagaron 2014; Leo et al. 2018; Ramos et al. 2016). 
Polysaccharides have a good gas barrier and mechanical properties with low 
moisture barrier properties (Rhim and Ng 2007), whereas the lipids have good water 
vapor barrier properties and high oxygen permeability but poor mechanical prop￾erties (Vodnar et al. 2015). Among polysaccharides, chitosan stands exceptional for 
food-packaging applications due to its intrinsic antioxidant (Friedman and Juneja 
2010) and antimicrobial properties against various microorganisms, such as gram￾positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and yeast (Kong et al. 2010; Pan et al. 
2015; Raafat and Sahl 2009; van den Broek et al. 2015). Chitosan is the second￾most abundant natural polysaccharide after cellulose. It is an acetylated cationic 
polysaccharide, linear semi-crystalline copolymer composed of randomly dis￾tributed D-Glucosamine units and N-acetyl D- glucosamine. Chitosan is obtained 
by the major crustacean shell component by alkaline deacetylation of chitin. 
Chitosan is different from chitin in the acetyl content, which is lower for chitosan 
polymers than chitin itself (Barikani et al. 2014). Although chitosan has intrinsic 
properties that make it a suitable natural polymer for the production of food￾packaging materials, it has some disadvantages; these include low mechanical and 
thermal stability, and high water sensitivity (due to the presence of the hydrophilic 
functional groups in chitosan). This might lead to the proliferation of micro￾organisms, limiting its application as neat chitosan films or coatings (Al-Tayyar, 
Youssef, and Al-Hindi 2020). In addition, the antioxidant activity and antimicrobial 
property of chitosan are limited to the acidic condition due to the loss of positive 
charges on the amino group at neutral pH, leading to the restriction of its anti￾microbial activity to some specific organisms only (Liu et al. 2004; Rodrigues et al. 
2020). Its solutions are precipitated as a hydrated gel above a pH of 6.2. Chitosan is 
a thermosetting plastic that decomposes before reaching its melting point. The 
Chitosan-Based Nanocomposites 57 mechanical properties of chitosan depend upon several factors, including the degree 
of deacetylation and molecular weight. Hence, chitosan by itself cannot be used for 
packaging applications. Modification of the chitosan is essential to improve its 
mechanical and biological properties for packaging material applications. Various 
kinds of packaging material, based on chitosan, were developed as hybrid com￾posites of organic or inorganic micro or nanoparticles, using cross-linkers (Jahan, 
Mathad, and Farheen 2016; Khouri, Penlidis, and Moresoli 2019), enzyme treat￾ment (Aguila-Almanza et al. 2019), blends of other biopolymers (Ji et al. 2017) and 
proteins (Di Pierro et al. 2011), high energy irradiation (Shahbazi, Rajabzadeh, and 
Ahmadi 2017), graft polymerization (Argüelles-Monal et al. 2018), and com￾plexation (Wang, Wang, and Heuzey 2016). 
Among the materials mentioned earlier, chitosan nanocomposites are a phase￾separated mixture by combining two chemically distinct phases to produce a 
composite material with enhanced physical properties (Cazón and Vázquez 2020; 
Khan, Mansha, and Mazumder 2018). The composite material enhances the ad￾vantages and minimizes the drawbacks of both the matrix and dispersed phase. The 
chitosan-based bionanocomposites include the chitosan blended with other natural 
biopolymers, synthetic biopolymers, or nanoparticles. These bionanocomposites are 
reported to possess different properties, like increased tensile strength, gas im￾permeability, bioavailability, water resistance, flame resistance, and antimicrobial 
activity thus mitigating all the drawbacks of neat chitosan (Hoffmann et al. 2019). 
These advantageous properties pave the way to use these composites in the food￾packaging field. 
Further, this chapter focuses on different production techniques of chitosan 
from various natural sources, its physical and chemical modification, and strategies 
for chitosan composites film production, as well as antibacterial and barrier properties 
of chitosan-based composites film reinforced with organic and inorganic nanofillers 
or a blend of chitosan with other bio-based polymers for food packaging application. 
3.2 SOURCE AND PRODUCTION OF CHITOSAN 
The most common sources for obtaining chitin and chitosan are exoskeletons and 
crustaceans such as shrimp and crabs (Muñoz et al. 2018; Younes and Rinaudo 
2015), while other species such as marine organisms, including crayfish, krill, and 
squid, are also widely used to produce chitosan (Abdou, Nagy, and Elsabee 2008; 
Nwe, Furuike, and Tamura 2010; Teng et al. 2001). However, different species 
show different content of chitin. For example, the content crustacean shells contain 
20% to 40% of chitin (Tolaimate et al. 2003). Organisms like insects and mush￾rooms have also been seen as alternative sources to produce chitosan (Kim 2010). 
Figure 3.1 and Table 3.1 show the chemical structure of chitin and chitosan and 
their sources. 
The chitosan preparation process usually refers to deacetylation; the classifi￾cation of quality chitosan preparation significantly impacts the synthesis of 
chitosan with varying degrees of acetylation (DA) and molecular weight (MW). 
Acetyl groups are removed during the deacetylation process, indicating the MW 
changes due to the depolymerization reaction. Chitosan is not soluble in water 
58 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications and organic solvents, but it can dissolve in an aqueous acidic solution. The 
chemical properties include the presence of amino groups along the chitosan 
backbone, which differ from chitin (Jardine and Sayed 2018). There are two 
processes, through enzymatic or chemical deacetylation, where chitin can be 
converted to chitosan. The most preferable for large-scale production of chitosan 
is through the chemical method of the deacetylation process because of its low 
cost and suitability to mass production (Yadav et al. 2019). Thermo-chemical 
hydrolysis of chitin is the common technique to manufacture chitosan in￾dustrially. This process takes place by using either an acid or an alkali solution. 
The alkali process is usually performed using 50% alkali solution at high 
temperature, which leads to hydrolysing the acetyl groups and converting the 
FIGURE 3.1 Chemical structure of chitin and chitosan and examples of species that contain 
chitin.

Chitosan-Based Nanocomposites 59 N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units into D-glucosamine units with free amine groups. 
However, the acidic process is less preferred because the glycosidic bond is 
mainly unstable, susceptible to acid hydrolysis, and produces unwanted chain 
termination (Hajji et al. 2014). Although thermo-chemical deacetylation is a cost￾effective technique and suitable for mass production, it has some disadvantages 
such as high energy consumption, environmental pollution, and difficult frac￾tionation of a mixture of heterogeneous species with different physicochemical 
properties produced during the process (Kaczmarek et al. 2019). Therefore, the 
trend is shifting toward more eco-friendly enzymatic methods. Chitin deacetylase 
is the only enzyme that can hydrolyze the linkage between acetyl and amine 
groups in the N-acetyl-D-glucosamine unit of chitin. The enzymes can be ex￾tracted from fungi or bacteria. However, the isolation of chitin deacetylase from 
bacterial strains is becoming popular due to the higher activity and faster and 
easier microbial growth in large-scale fermentation systems (Priyadarshi and 
Rhim 2020). In addition, microbial enzymes produce a relatively higher yield of 
chitosan oligosaccharides than the enzymes from fungi (Kim and Rajapakse 
2005). The mode of action of chitin deacetylase enzyme extracted from different 
sources is different. For example, the fungal deacetylase enzyme extracted from 
colletotrichum lindemuthianum is an endo-type extracellular enzyme that cata￾lyzes the hydrolysis reaction of acetamide groups according to the multiple-chain 
mechanism. Alternatively, enzymes extracted from mucor rouxii is exo-type and 
hydrolyses the acetyl groups of chitinous polymers from the non-reducing end 
according to the multiple-attack mechanism. It is worth noting that the efficiency 
of enzyme deacetylation is limited due to the high crystallinity and low in￾solubility of chitin in an aqueous medium. Thus, to maximize the enzyme dea￾cetylation efficiency, pre-treatment of native chitin is an essential step. Chitin is 
usually treated with strong acids to increase the enzyme accessibility, increasing 
the acetylation process rate and efficiency (Guo et al. 2017). The advantages of 
enzymatic deacetylation are well known; they include its high selectivity, low 
energy consumption, production of chitosan of homogenous deacetylation with 
high yield, and the possibility of a controlled alkaline solution waste that saves 
environmental pollution. 
3.3 FUNCTIONALIZATION OF CHITOSAN 
Modification of chitosan enables alteration of the properties, such as water solu￾bility and stability, new biological activity, and improved chemical and mechanical 
properties. Thanks to the available functional groups, –NH2 and –OH, chitosan can 
be modified both chemically and physically to match the various research needs. 
Chemical modification of chitosan has been done through acetylation, methylation, 
alkylation, quaternization, N-succinylation, hydroxylation, thiolation, sulphonation, 
phosphorylation, xanthation, acylation, nitration, and graft copolymerization. The 
details on reaction conditions and induced functional groups, as well as properties 
of chemically modified chitosan obtained by various kinds of modifiers, are well 
explained by Brasselet et al., 2019 and El Knidri et al., 2018. 
60 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications Physical modification of chitosan includes blending/mixing chitosan with other 
polymers, essential oils, or fillers. The properties of the modified polymer can be 
determined depending on the ratios of the polymers being mixed. Blending is the 
most cost-effective technique for developing new chitosan-based materials while 
having promising physicochemical properties. Other chitosan modification techni￾ques include irradiation and plasma treatment. These techniques are cost-effective 
and environmentally friendly. Radiation results in structural changes such as 
crosslinking, chain scission, and free radical formation of chitosan, while plasma 
treatment modifies the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the chitosan. More 
information on irradiation and plasma modification of chitosan can be found in 
Mittal et al., 2018. 
3.4 CHITOSAN-BASED COMPOSITES PROCESSING TECHNIQUES 
Chitosan-based film composite for food-packaging applications has been prepared 
using a variety of processes. These include direct casting, coating, dip-coating 
(immersion techniques), layer-by-layer assembly, and extrusion, along with other 
combinations. The following sections briefly explain each preparation technique, its 
advantages and disadvantages, the differences, and some recent publications on the 
production of chitosan-based composites via different techniques, with the obtained 
results listed in Table 3.2. 
3.4.1 SOLUTION CASTING 
The solution-casting method is one of the most widely used methods for pre￾paring chitosan-based films at the laboratory scale. It is a simple method, and the 
tools necessary for casting operations are affordable. Solution-casting methods 
generally include dissolving chitosan in an acidic solution; mixing or crosslinking 
with other polymers or functional materials, additives, or fillers; and then fil￾tering, sonication, or centrifugation to remove any remaining insoluble particles 
and air bubbles. Finally, the solution is stirred to obtain homogeneous viscose 
solution, the solution is cast onto level bottom, and it is dried under a controlled 
temperature, humidity, and time. The obtained film can be easily peeled off from 
the casting mould and stored to analyse for its microstructure, chemical bonding, 
crystallinity, colour, and mechanical performance. The film formulation and 
drying condition are the main factors for determining the quality of the chitosan￾cast films and improving comprehensive properties. Solution casting is a simple 
and relatively low-cost method, but scaling up the film-forming process by this 
technique may pose challenges and needs further research to analyze its feasi￾bility at the commercial scale. 
3.4.2 COATING 
Coating is a frequently used technique to create thin films of chitosan on the 
surface of various kinds of foods, such as fruit, vegetables, meat, fish, etc., which is 
considered as direct coating. It can also be used to immobilize functional polymers

Chitosan-Based Nanocomposites 63 on the surface of packaging materials, which is considered an indirect coating to 
achieve desired properties or protection. Coating technology is divided into 
spreading, spraying, dipping, or immersing food materials into chitosan-based 
composite solutions. The spread coating is performed with a brush or spatula. 
Spray coating is achieved using the compressed air-assisted sprayer, knapsack 
sprayer, and copper backpack. The immersing or dipping technique involves 
submerging the food in an acidic chitosan film-forming solution. Generally, the 
coating process of food products involves the following steps: formulation of in￾itial materials; mechanical treatment, such as mixing, heating, irradiation, and 
steam-flash pasteurizing; disinfection of food samples using sodium hypochlorite; 
spreading or sparing of chitosan solution onto the food or immersing the sample 
into the solution to form a uniform coating layer; drying in a certain condition; and 
packaging and storing inappropriate conditions. The success of the film composite 
after the dipping process formation depends on the surface’s adequate wetting 
capacity, processing time, and draining time. At the same time, spray and spread￾coating quality depend on the viscosity of the solution and surface tension. The 
disadvantages of the dip-coating technique are that the procedure is sluggish and 
can obstruct the screen, which will significantly impact the final result. Combining 
coating with other treatments, such as irradiation and modification of packaging 
atmosphere, is reported to be effective for improving the food shelf life (Severino 
et al. 2015). Coating is an effective way to significantly improve food quality and 
enhance its shelf life by affecting gas permeability and limiting the growth of 
microorganisms. The advantages of coating are its simplicity and inexpensive cost, 
which does not require complicated equipment. However, it may compromise the 
sensory attributes of the treated food (Muxika et al. 2017). The disadvantages of 
the dip-coating technique are that the procedure is sluggish and can obstruct the 
screen, which will significantly impact the final result (Nowzari, Shábanpour, and 
Ojagh 2013). The preservation properties of food have been highly effective (Jiang 
et al. 2020; Sikder and Islam 2019). 
3.4.3 LAYER-BY-LAYER ASSEMBLY 
The layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly method is the most suited technique for pro￾ducing multi-functional film used for packaging application because it is not shape 
and size dependent and does not require high temperature or pressure. In the LBL 
assembly technique, multilayer films are deposited onto the surface of the substrate 
through alternative adsorption of deposited materials. The materials interact with 
each other via driving forces such as electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and 
covalent bonds. These properties allow the controlled release of the antibacterial 
agent into packaging space and improve the film’s barrier properties, depending on 
the used materials in the particular layers. Some factors are important in the LBL 
process, which affects the film formation and properties of the final product, such as 
pH, which determines the amount of deposited polymer to neutralize the previous 
layer. The number of layers is another important factor that is influenced by pH. The 
number of layers increases with decreasing pH, leading to an increase in the film 
thickness, roughness, and mechanical properties (Ferná
ndez et al. 2014). Moreover, 
64 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications the antibacterial activity of the film improved with the increase of bilayer number 
(del Hoyo-Gallego et al. 2016). 
3.4.4 EXTRUSION 
Extrusion has been developed extensively to fabricate biodegradable chitosan-based 
active packaging and extruded chitosan films in a variety of compositions. 
Generally, the extrusion method includes several steps; formulations of initial 
polymers using different compositions, the mixing and blending of the mixture in 
an extruder at a controlled temperature, cutting extrudates into pellets through the 
pelletizer, drying pellets in an oven, and extruding the pellets into sheets through the 
second extruder. The extruded polymer can also be directly fed to a blown-film 
extruder and formed into a thin film. Extrusion is an excellent method for fabri￾cating films with desirable mechanical, thermal, and antibacterial properties. 
However, the interaction and compatibility between polymers and processing 
temperatures should be controlled to achieve the obtained film’s best performance. 
Extrusion is often preferred over solution-casting methods due to faster processing 
time, lower energy consumption, and being environmentally friendly. 
3.5 ANTIBACTERIAL NANOCOMPOSITES 
Antimicrobial food packaging involves the packaging material that reduces, in￾hibits, or slows the growth of food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms on the 
food through chemical and physical factors (Espitia et al. 2016). The antimicrobial 
additives can be added in any of the three components of packed food material, 
including food-packaging materials, food products, and/or in the headspace atmo￾sphere (Han 2005). An important application of antimicrobial packaging comes 
with the packaging of sensitive food like bakery products, fruits or vegetables, dairy 
products, meat, fish, and poultry products (Raj and Matche 2012). Antimicrobial 
packaging is important when comes to transportation and storage, with increasing 
consumer demand for fresh, safe, convenient, nutrient-rich food. 
Bacteria, viruses, and parasites are the main elements of food spoilage and 
poisoning. Some bacteria in small amounts do not cause any harm, and the body is 
capable of fighting them. Nevertheless, the trouble happens when it multiplies and 
spreads. As per the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the eight 
known bacteria, viruses, and parasites that cause food spoilage, and later illness, 
hospitalization, and death, include salmonella, clostridium perfringens, campylo￾bacter, ataphylococcus aureus, E. coli, listeria monocytogenes, norovirus, and 
toxoplasma gondii (Balter 2006). 
The actual mechanism for the antimicrobial activity of chitosan is not yet clear, 
even though many have proposed different theories. These include: (a) The elec￾trostatic interaction between the positively charged ammonium groups on the sur￾face of chitosan and the negatively charged microbial cell constituents like proteins, 
amino acids, phosphoryl group of phospholipid components and various lipopoly￾saccharides (Elsabee and Abdou 2013; Hosseinnejad and Jafari 2016; Khaneghah, 
Hashemi, and Limbo 2018). This leads to cell membrane rupture and cell leakage, 
Chitosan-Based Nanocomposites 65 which eventually causes cell death (Goy, Britto, and Assis 2009). (b) The chelating 
property of chitosan bind with metal ions inhibiting metabolic enzymes, reducing 
microbial growth (Hosseinnejad and Jafari 2016). (c) The molecular weight of the 
chitosan now plays the role of antimicrobial activity. The high molecular weight 
chitosan binds with microbes, forming an impervious layer and restricting the nu￾trient’s entry into the cell. In contrast, the low molecular weight polymer penetrates 
the cytosol and attaches with the DNA, inhibiting RNA replications and protein 
synthesis, leading to cell death (Kasirga, Oral, and Caner 2012; Raafat and Sahl 
2009; Verlee, Mincke, and Stevens 2017). The first mechanism is the most accepted 
one among these proposed mechanisms, further supported by Lou et al., 2011. 
Even though chitosan has intrinsic antimicrobial properties, the food-packaging 
field needs much more enhanced antimicrobial properties for increased shelf life 
and the preservation of food quality. For this reason, many reports of chitosan 
bionanocomposites have been published with the aid of different natural anti￾microbials and nanostructures of antimicrobials like metal and metal oxide nano￾particles (Matharu, Ciric, and Edirisinghe 2018). We can classify the antimicrobial 
chitosan-based nanocomposites under different categories based on the blended 
chemical structures as discussed in the following sections. 
3.5.1 CHITOSAN–NATURAL POLYMER COMPOSITES 
The combination of chitosan with biopolymers like polysaccharides, proteins, and 
their derivatives are found to exhibit improved properties for active packaging 
coating or film in the food-packaging field. These natural polymers can be obtained 
from plants, animals, or other microbial sources (Huang et al. 2019). They are 
biocompatible, biodegradable, and shown to have antimicrobial activity against a 
broad range of microorganisms. The goodness of natural polymers in the chitosan 
nanocomposites lies in the fact that it could improve the nutritive value, stop or 
minimize the growth of microbes, and control spoilage of the foods (Davidson et al. 
2015). They can preserve the appearance, quality, taste, of the food and enhance its 
shelf life (Kumar, Mukherjee, and Dutta 2020). The compatibility between the 
chitosan and the biopolymer depends on the electrostatic interaction between the 
cationic protonated amino group of chitosan at a pH greater than 6.3 (Li et al. 2010) 
and the high-polarity groups like NH2, C=O, -C-O-C- groups in the corresponding 
polymers (Bonilla et al. 2018). Polysaccharides like starch, cellulose, pectin, car￾rageenan, alginate, xanthan gum, glucose, xylan and its derivatives, proteins like 
gelatine, casein, collagen, whey protein, corn zein, wheat gluten, etc. are reported to 
be blended with chitosan for food-packaging applications. High abundance, good 
mechanical and thermal properties, gas-barrier properties, and aroma add up to the

vallinin, cinnamaldehyde). Essential oils exhibit antimicrobial properties against 
both bacteria and fungi, whereas the chitosan solution or films exhibit little or no 
activity against fungi. Hence, the combination of oil with chitosan synergizes the 
antibacterial and antifungal characteristics. Fungi are very sensitive to the vapours 
of the essential oils, thereby inhibiting their growth either through direct contact or 
the vapour diffusion method. The antimicrobial activity of some essential oil en￾hances the chitosan presence, as in the case of films; the films allow a slow constant 
release of the oil vapours, thereby maintaining a high concentration of the vapours 
in the atmosphere to inhibit the growth of microbes (Wang et al. 2011). Reports 
have included essential oils of oregano, cinnamon, clove, and eucalyptus (Yuan, 
Chen, and Li 2016). These composites reduced, inhibited, and delayed the growth 
of microorganisms (Ponce, Roura, and Moreira 2016). A synopsis of the reports on 
antimicrobial activity of the bionanocomposites of chitosan containing essential oils 
is listed in Table 3.3. 
3.5.3 CHITOSAN–METAL NANOPARTICLE COMPOSITE 
Metal nanoparticles, especially Ag, Au, and Cu nanoparticles, exhibit excellent 
antimicrobial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive 
bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and certain viruses (Hoseinnejad, Jafari, and Katouzian 
2018; Kumar et al. 2017). Different mechanisms are formulated for the anti￾microbial activity of metal nanoparticles. (a) The electrostatic binding of the 
metal nanoparticles to the cell membrane thereby affects membrane potential, cell 
respiration, and transport, causing cell lysis (Pelgrift and Friedman 2013). (b) The 
generation of reactive organic species (ROS) by stimulating nanoparticles on less 
toxic oxidants like superoxide and hydrogen peroxide or the stimulation of light 
on some semiconductor nanoparticles catalyzes ROS formation. The ROS causes 
severe oxidation, lipid peroxidation, enzyme inhibition, and protein alteration that 
leads to microbial death (Pan et al. 2010; Sathe et al. 2016). The nanoparticle 
shape, size, and surface groups determine ROS generation. The increase in par￾ticle size decreases the permeation through the cell membrane of microbes (Dizaj 
et al. 2014, Sathe et al. 2017). The release of metal ions like Ag+
, Cu+
, Zn2+ from 
nanomaterials generates ROS by reacting with molecular oxygen (Joe et al. 
2018). (c) Direct inhibition of the enzymes in microbes. (d) Generation of re￾active nitrogen species. (e) Induction of the programmed cell death (Dizaj et al. 
2014). The chitosan/metal species nanocomposites show the synergistic effects 
through the aforementioned mechanisms. The chelating property of chitosan with 
metal ions increases the nanocomposite’s positive charge density and anti￾microbial activity. The chelation to form the chitin-metal complexes depends on 
the chitosan/metal ion molar ratio, type of metal ion, DD of chitosan, and mo￾lecular weight (Atay 2019). We shall discuss different metals so far associated 
with chitosan for food-packaging applications. 
Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been an emerging promising candidate for 
food-packaging applications, along with chitosan since it possesses antimicrobial 
Chitosan-Based Nanocomposites 69 activity against different bacteria like pseudomonas spp., enterobacteriaceae, 
escherichia coli (Mastromatteo et al. 2015), staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus 
faecalis, vibrio cholerae, and also against some fungi like aspergillus niger and 
candida albicans (Hoffmann et al. 2019). For food-packaging applications, 
AgNPs are synthesized by the bottom-up approach (Roy et al. 2013). The amine 
and hydroxyl functional groups of chitosan reduce Ag+ ions to AgNPs in situ in 
the chitosan matrix in an alkaline medium (Boufi et al. 2013). Copper is cheaper 
than silver and is a ubiquitously available antimicrobial agent when compared to 
silver. Therefore, its use in the food-packaging field is cost-effective and easy 
(Rai et al. 2018). At low concentration, copper acts as a metalloenzyme, whereas, 
in higher concentrations, it acts as an antimicrobial agent against pathogens like 
campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enetrica, E.coli, C. albicans, K. pneumonia, S. 
aureus, A. niger, M. luteus, A. flavus, and P. aeruginosa (Faúndez et al. 2004, 
Ramyadevi et al. 2012). Anti-fungal activity of CuNPs with chitosan was also 
investigated against alternaria solani, aspergillus niger, aspergillus flavus, and 
candida albicans, and fusarium oxysporum (Ramyadevi et al. 2012, Tamayo et al. 
2016). The mechanism behind the antimicrobial activity of CuNPs is not well 
understood, but a few reports suggest that the Cu ions interact with the surface 
carboxyl group of the cell wall of the microbes (Ingle, Duran, and Rai 2014, Ren 
et al. 2009) or by the release of ROS through the interaction of Cu ions on the cell 
wall (Raffi et al. 2010, Swarnkar et al. 2016) or interaction of ions with the amine 
functional groups of peptidoglycans layer causing denaturation of proteins, or by 
the binding of Cu ions with DNA, which involves the interaction with the nuclear 
strands causing the de-organization of the helical structure of DNA or by the 
endocytosis (Ottman et al. 2019). The antimicrobial activity depends on the size, 
electrostatic interaction, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the nanoparticles, 
and the composition of the bacteria cell wall (Rai et al. 2018). Gold nanoparticles 
also are a potential antimicrobial agent in food-packaging applications. The 
AuNPs are usually synthesized by reducing gold salts in the presence of stabi￾lizers like ionic silsesquioxane. This stabilizer functionalized with quaternary 
ammonium groups shows antimicrobial properties and is essential for AuNPs 
synthesis (Hoffmann et al. 2019). Gold particles in conjugation with other mo￾lecules like antibiotics, drugs, and vaccines are more efficient than the gold 
particles alone (Tao 2018). A synopsis of the reports on antimicrobial activity of 
the bionanocomposites of chitosan with metal nanoparticles is listed in Table 3.4. 
3.5.4 CHITOSAN–METAL OXIDE NANOPARTICLE COMPOSITES 
Metal-oxide nanoparticle-biopolymer composites are of particular interest to re￾searchers because of their antimicrobial activity and mechanical and barrier 
properties (Dizaj et al. 2014, Galstyan et al. 2018). They are common nano-fillers 
in the biopolymer matrix. Commonly reported metal-oxide nanoparticles with 
chitosan for antimicrobial activity include zinc oxide (ZnO), copper oxide (CuO), 
and titanium dioxide (TiO2). They generate ROS to cause oxidative stress 
leading to RNA/DNA damage of the microbes (André et al. 2015) and also 
cause phospholipid peroxidation leading to the loss of membrane integrity 
70 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications (Kumar, Mukherjee, and Dutta 2020). Nanoparticles of ZnO have antibacterial 
properties against S. aureus and L. monocytogenes by inhibition and inactivation 
of cell development (Morsy et al. 2014). They also can enhance hydrophobicity 
and barrier properties (Indumathi and Rajarajeswari 2019). The nanoparticle size 
of CuO determines its antimicrobial property. The small size of CuO increases the 
mobility of Cu ions, which enables them to interact with bacterial membranes. 
CuO nanoparticles show superior activity against gram-positive and gram-nega￾tive bacteria (Conte et al. 2013). Titanium dioxide exhibits antimicrobial activity 
in the presence of UV light via photocatalysis. It has shown activity against 
various food-borne pathogens like vibrio parahaemolyticus, listeria mono￾cytogenes, and aalmonella choleraesius (Hoffmann et al. 2019). A synopsis of the 
reports on antimicrobial activity of the bionanocomposites of chitosan with metal￾oxide nanoparticles is listed in Table 3.5.

72 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 3.5.5 CHITOSAN–SYNTHETIC POLYMER COMPOSITES 
Synthetic biodegradable polymers like polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyrro￾lidone (PVP), and polylactic acid (PLA) are in competition with biopolymers in 
terms of diverse range of chemical resistance, physical, and mechanical features, 
along with the low cost of production (El Bourakadi et al. 2019). The chitosan blend 
with polymer depends on the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the hy￾droxyl groups of polymer and amine functionality of the chitosan (Bonilla et al. 
2018). These interactions help enhance the mechanical and barrier properties of the 
composites (Haghighi et al. 2020). Synthetic polymers and chitosan have different 
advantages and disadvantages that can complement each other; therefore, when 
both are combined in the context of antimicrobial property and packaging, the re￾quisite is achieved by the synergistic effect of both. A synopsis of the reports on 
antimicrobial activity of the bionanocomposites of chitosan with synthetic biopo￾lymer nanoparticles is listed in Table 3.6. 
3.6 BARRIER NANOCOMPOSITES 
The polymeric materials used for packaging should exhibit excellent barrier 
properties. The term barrier indicates that it should be impermeable to gases, va￾pours, oils, and organic compounds. Water vapor and other gases penetrated 
through the packaging material may result in the spoilage of food items. Moisture 
absorption through the packaging films may induce the growth of various

Chitosan-Based Nanocomposites 73 microorganisms. The packaging material should also possess good UV-resistance 
properties. UV radiations can cause the photo-oxidation of food items like oils and 
fats. The permeation of a gas through a polymer takes place via solution and dif￾fusion mechanisms. The diffusion of small molecules through the polymer matrix 
depends upon several factors. Hydrogen and dipolar bonds enhance the inter￾molecular cohesion between the polymer chains, thereby decreasing the passage of 
small molecules. The number and volume of microcavities present in the polymer 
matrix will also affect the barrier properties of packaging materials. The micro￾cavities facilitate the easy passage of gases. The morphology of packaging material 
also plays a key role in determining its barrier properties. Barrier properties increase 
with more crystallinity. Generally, crystalline regions restrict the movement of 
small molecules, while amorphous regions allow the permeation of molecules 
through them (Hedenqvist 2005; Lagaron, Catalá, and Gavara 2004). 
The chitosan films have a very low water barrier (Cazón and Vázquez 2020). 
Park et al. (Park, Daeschel, and Zhao 2004) prepared chitosan films with a water 
vapour permeability of 177.2 ± 47.4 g mm/m2 d kPa. The poor water resistance 
properties of chitosan films are due to the presence of a large number of hydrophilic 
hydroxyl and amino groups. Leceta and coworkers prepared high molecular weight 
chitosan films with oxygen permeability of 6.65 ± 0.39 cm3 m m−2 day−1 kPa−1 and 
low molecular weight chitosan films with oxygen permeability of 7.70 ± 0.72 cm3 
m m−2 day−1 kPa−1 (Leceta, Guerrero, and De La Caba 2013). 
The barrier properties of chitosan films can be improved by adding various or￾ganic and inorganic nanosized particles. Several reinforcing materials like nano￾cellulose, nanoclays, and metal oxides in nano form were added as fillers for 
manufacturing chitosan-based nanocomposites for food-packaging applications. 
The fillers were reported to reduce the water vapour transmission rate, oxygen 
permeability, and U.V transmittance of the composite film (Pires et al. 2021). 
Moisture and gaseous-resistance properties of chitosan composite films help to 
improve the shelf lives of packaged food materials. 
3.6.1 NANOCELLULOSE-CHITOSAN COMPOSITE 
Both cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) were reported as 
excellent fillers for preparing composite films with chitosan. The superior mechanical 
and barrier properties of composite films are due to the presence of many hydrogen 
bonds between the nanocellulose and chitosan. The strong electrostatic interaction 
between the nanocellulose and chitosan tends to increase the crystallinity of the 
composite (Souza et al. 2020). The good dispersion of nanocellulose in the chitosan 
matrix helps to reduce water infiltration. The hydrophobicity of nanocellulose-chit￾osan composite films was proved by contact angle measurements and water-swelling 
experiments. The 3D network structure of nanocellulose in the chitosan matrix was 
reported to effectively block the UV radiations (Yadav et al. 2020). Most researchers 
compared the water vapor permeability of nanocellulose-chitosan composite films 
with pure chitosan films. The addition of nanocellulose generally reduced composite 
films’ water vapour transmission rates. Yadav and co-workers noticed that in the 
chitosan-based films loaded with (0–8 wt%) CNC, water vapor permeability reduced 
74 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications from 3.83 × 10−11 to 2.41 × 10−11 gm−1 s
−1Pa−1. A list of recent publications on the 
barrier properties of nanocellulose-chitosan composites is shown in Table 3.7. 
3.6.2 NANOCLAY-CHITOSAN COMPOSITES 
Montmorillonite clays and halloysite nanotubes are widely used as fillers for 
making chitosan composite films for food packaging (Table 3.7). The biodegrad￾ability and non-toxicity of these clays are of great concern. These fillers will help to 
slow the water vapour transmission rate of chitosan-based composite films. Due to 
more tortuous routes for diffusing molecules that must cross impermeable platelets, 
the presence of nanoclay is predicted to reduce oxygen permeability. The presence 
of nanoclay helps to improve the mechanical and thermal properties of composite 
films. The high aspect ratio and surface area of clay particles plays a key role in the 
barrier properties of composite films. Water vapour passing through the film is 
forced to take a tortuous route through the polymer matrix enclosing the clay 
particles, extending the effective diffusion path length. The layered structure of the 
clay and its uniform dispersion makes a barrier to water vapour and gases. Because 
the aspect ratio of stacked platelets is reduced, the contact between polymer and 
clay is likewise reduced. As a result of this impact, the WVTR decrease is noticed 
(Kasirga, Oral, and Caner 2012). Examples of barrier properties of nanoclay-chit￾osan composites are provided in Table 3.8. 
3.6.3 METAL OXIDE NANOPARTICLES-CHITOSAN COMPOSITES 
The dispersion of nano-formed metal oxides in the chitosan matrix reduces the hy￾drophilicity of chitosan. Metal oxide nanoparticles dispersed as aggregates inside the 
polymer matrix. Nano-metal oxide-reinforced chitosan composites exhibit excellent

Water swelling and water solubility properties of chitosan films were significantly 
reduced by the incorporation of metal oxides in the nanoform. Metal oxides tend to 
reduce the hydrogen bonds between chitosan and water vapor (Table 3.9).

76 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 3.7 SUMMARY AND PERSPECTIVE 
Over the last decade, considerable interest and attention has been focused on ap￾plying chitosan and its derivatives in food packaging due to its unique properties. 
Food-packaging materials based on chitosan are biodegradable, antibacterial, bio￾compatible, and have low cytotoxicity. Incorporating organic and inorganic nano￾materials and essential oils into chitosan improves the antimicrobial, mechanical, 
and barrier properties of the fabricated films and coatings to some extent, leading to 
improved food quality and shelf-life extension. However, more effort is needed to 
develop chitosan-based films that can meet the practical criteria and compete with 
petroleum-based packaging films. For example, some strategies require improving 
the mechanical and thermal properties of chitosan films. Water sensitivity and 
hydrophilicity are other drawbacks of chitosan film that should be considered be￾cause it leads to the proliferation of microorganisms and limits its application as a 
neat chitosan film or coating. Thus, more chitosan derivatives and functional ma￾terials are required to overcome this drawback. In addition, the existing production 
technologies could be optimized for getting closer to industrial production. Toxicity 
studies of chitosan films need to be performed when the film contains metal na￾noparticles or chemical modifier agents and has direct contact with food. Moreover, 
new technologies are still required for the facilely mass production of chitosan￾based films with desired properties to meet different packaging applications. 
Degradation and environmental impact and life cycle assessment of chitosan-based 
films are other important subjects that require further studies. Despite the research 
as mentioned above and a gap in the development of chitosan-based food packaging 
materials, it surely has significant opportunities for implementation as a natural 
antimicrobial packaging material for the new generation of active packaging.

4.1 INTRODUCTION 
Packaging is vital in today’s international market to permit real-time supply, 
preserve food goods, ease end-user compatibility, and support customer-level 
communication. Food packaging protects food from environmental contamina￾tion and other impacts (such as odors, shocks, dust, temperature, physical da￾mage, light, microorganisms, and humidity). Microorganisms, gases, smells, 
water vapor, dust, and mechanical trauma are all examples of unfavorable outside 
and inside circumstances that food goods are protected against during trans￾portation and storage (Youssef and El-Sayed 2018). The shelf-life of food can be 
damaged, and the risk of illness and infections to humans increases by various 
food-borne infections, threatening public health (Devlieghere, Vermeiren, and 
Debevere 2004). 
Each year, 76 million U.S. individuals get food-borne infections, according to 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These include 5000 fatal￾ities and 325,000 hospitalizations (Morris 2011). Also, the environmental im￾plications of food-packaging substances have steadily become a serious concern 
globally, specifically for firms and manufacturers, since the amount of packaging 
used rises. Innovative packaging materials based on renewable resources that are 
ecofriendly, biodegradable, compostable, or recyclable, and minimize pollution, 
must be developed (Han et al. 2018). Therefore, it is required to ensure the safety 
and quality of food, prolong shelf life, and prevent food losses and waste (Carocho, 
Morales and Ferreira 2015; Ribeiro-Santos et al. 2017). This is especially important 
since improper packaging can increase medical costs and cause fatalities, adding to 
the financial burden of lost labor and medical costs, particularly for low-income 
families. 
Oxidation is one example of deterioration for many foods, by which the nutri￾tional value of food is decreased due to breaking down vital fatty acids, proteins, 
and lipid-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K, producing off flavors and color) (Nerín 
et al. 2008). Also, one issue that can affect food quality is moisture, making barrier 
properties critical requirements for many food-packaging options. They affect 
sensory properties such as texture, firmness, softness, crispiness, and control 
aerobic spoilage and pathogen growth (Dehnad and Emam-Djomeh et al. 2014). 
Another factor that can decrease the nutritional and organoleptic quality of food is 
oxygen. Since proteins, lipids, and chemicals emit aromas, the critical fatty acids, 
vitamins, and pigments are oxidized, affecting nutritional value (Jafari et al. 2018). 
Furthermore, maintaining the physical integrity of films is critical for main￾taining barrier qualities; hence, mechanical features are also significant for food 
preservation (Khanzadi et al. 2015; Jafarzadeh et al. 2020). 
94 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications On the other hand, the food industry uses traditional physical and chemical 
preservation methods to solve the problems that can badly affect food quality. One 
of the most common techniques is using antimicrobial chemicals or immersing food 
in an antibacterial solution (Sung et al. 2013). Nevertheless, these techniques are 
limited because food products suffer from the diffusion of such antimicrobial 
agents, affecting the quality and health of food products. It is essential to find other 
alternative techniques, especially with the increased demands of consumers to use 
more fresh and healthy foods (Sung et al. 2013). 
Food-packaging development will assist in addressing the market’s growing 
demands, such as customer preferences for healthy and high-quality food items and 
decreasing food packaging’s negative environmental implications (Han et al. 2018). 
Packaging materials used in the food industry should have antimicrobial properties 
that make them promising for increasing food shelf life, improving storage and 
stability, and preventing spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms that keep food 
safe and maintain food quality (Falguera et al. 2011). 
Biopolymer packaging materials are environmentally friendly but they have 
disadvantages. Compared to petroleum-based polymers, they are costly and have 
weaker thermal, mechanical, and barrier properties against oxygen, water vapor, 
microbes, light, and high humidity conditions, limiting their use in industry (Tajik 
et al. 2013). These drawbacks should be addressed to preserve the commercial 
viability of biodegradable films. 
Recently, the food industry has been interested in developing food-packaging 
materials to preserve food products (with quality & safety) since packaging material 
has a critical effect on food’s storage, transportation, and shelf life. Active, brilliant, 
and eco-friendly packaging technologies can work together to produce a multi￾functional system of food packaging, preventing negative interactions between 
ingredients. This might be considered the eventual goal for food-packaging 
technology in the future (Han et al. 2018). 
Nanotechnology has transformed nearly every technology and science sector, 
including the food-packaging business. As a result, specific nanoparticles can be 
employed in food-contact components to extend the food shelf life. It is crucial in 
creating innovative packaging implementations systems that suit customer needs. 
Currently, different inorganic and metal nanoparticles have been used to develop 
vital food packaging andsubstances and prolong the food’s shelf life. Packaging 
using nanocomposites has several advantages, including less preservative use 
and a faster rate of microbial growth inhibition (Hoseinnejad et al. 2017). 
Nanotechnology can produce materials or substances with at least one dimension 
and about a length of 1–100 nm, making materials brighter and having good 
chemical and physical properties (Youssef, Bujdos, et al. 2013; Youssef, Kamel, 
and El-Samahy 2013; Youssef and El-Sayed 2018). 
Nanocomposites can outperform typical composites as a result of the nanofiller’s 
excellent surface. Mechanical characteristics like stiffness, strength, toughness, 
thermal stability, and barrier characteristics may be enhanced by nanofillers 
(Alexandre et al. 2000). 
Nanocomposities, as a result of their nanoscale, have a significant surface-to￾volume ratio, and they have higher surface activity. Furthermore, nanocomposites 
Barrier Properties of Lignin Nanomaterial 95 are used to improve other polymers used in food packaging. They can make thermal 
and mechanical stability changes while also improving electrical conduction 
(Thostenson, Li, and Chou 2005; Uskoković 2007). 
The primary goal of bio-nano composite packaging is to boost the barrier qua￾lities of food packaging, which can reduce the transfer of gas, moisture, and UV 
radiation exposition, thermal, mechanical, and antibacterial characteristics. Also, 
metal nanoparticles can enhance the thermal, mechanical, chemical, structural, and 
barrier characteristics. Furthermore, using eco-friendly materials, plant extracts, and 
nano-form materials to fabricate sustainable packaging can minimize food packa￾ging’s environmental impact (Han et al. 2018). 
The permeability of polymeric materials to gases and vapors, such as oxygen, 
carbon dioxide, and organic vapors, makes biopolymers more ideal for food 
packaging as they have high water-vapor permeability (Arora and Padua 2010). 
As explained by oxygen-scavenging capability, antimicrobial activity, and the 
level of exposition to different damaging characteristics like oxygen levels or 
wholly inadequate temperatures, a wide variety of nanomaterials are appropriate to 
offer innovative and/or brilliant characteristics for food-packaging components 
(Youssef and El-Sayed 2018). 
Using polymer nanocomposites in food packaging has been found to have a 
significant impact because they can reduce food wastage, generate safe and healthy 
foodstuffs (oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor permeability), and have pre￾ferable mechanical characteristics, recycled content, biodegradability, fire re￾sistance, thermal stability, optical clarity, and promising antibacterial and antifungal 
surfaces (Llorens et al. 2012). Also, organic antimicrobial materials are one of the 
solutions used to solve one of the problems in food packaging. Nevertheless, they 
are limited to being utilized in food-packaging applications due to their minimal 
thermal stability. At the same time, inorganic antimicrobial agents, like metallic 
nanoparticles, are utilized in the food-packaging industry because they have high 
thermostability (Llorens et al. 2012). 
As mentioned, this chapter will focus on one of the smartest nanomaterials used 
in the food-packaging industry. Nanolignin, and its effect on other materials, aim to 
improve packaging material properties. 
4.2 LIGNIN IN THE FOOD PACKAGING INDUSTRY 
Lignin is particularly attractive because of its low cost, biodegradability, and 
lack of toxicity; it might be used to generate novel materials or chemicals 
(Zhang et al. 2021). The use of lignin-biopolymer film in the inner layer of food￾packaging systems boosts some features of their interpretation during storage, 
not only by prevention of chemical compound migration from the package to the 
food but also by the packaging system’s radical scavenging activity and UV￾blocking ability (Mohammad Zadeh et al. 2019). Large particle size, hetero￾geneity, poor dispersibility, and irregular morphology make lignin an unideal 
substance. Different chemical techniques may be utilized in lignin modification 
to generate high-value components, such as lignin nanoparticles (Figueiredo 
et al. 2018). 
96 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 4.2.1 THE STRUCTURE OF NATIVE LIGNIN 
Native lignin accounts for 20%–30% of plant cell walls, forming a cross-linked 
network around cellulose and hemicelluloses to give firmness and antibacterial, 
antioxidant, and UV absorption characteristics (D. Kai et al. 2016). The percentage 
of each constituent differs from one plant material to another. the difference be￾tween softwood and hardwood is the type of lignin since the significant component 
of softwood lignin is the G lignin unit, while in hardwood, G lignin units and S 
lignin units are found with the same percentage (Li et al. 2015; Tian et al. 2017a, 
2017b; Schneider et al. 2021). As a result, producing nanoparticles using low-cost 
and plentiful lignin raw materials is crucial for increasing their high value-added 
use (Stewart 2008). Lignin is synthesized in polymers by three hydroxycinnamyl 
alcohols: p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohols. It is composed of three￾dimensional heteropolymers produced from the oxidative coupling of the three 
p-hydroxycinnamyl alcohol known as monolignols, p-coumaryl, coniferyl, and si￾napyl alcohols. The coupling reaction of monolignol radicals results in a hetero￾polymer, which is a hydrophobic consisting of p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), 
and syringyl (S) units (Vanholme et al. 2010). P-hydroxyphenyl formed from 
coumaryl alcohol, which is called lignin H, is the essential constituent of lignin. 
However, guaiacil formed from coniferyl alcohol, called lignin G. syringil, resulting 
from synaphyl alcohol called lignin S. (Carvalho et al. 2009; Schneider et al. 2021). 
(Figure 4.1). 
The chart shows lignin synthesis from three P-hydroxycinnamyl alcohol 
(monolignols), such as P-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol. 
Each substance undergoes an oxidative stress process to produce P-hydroxyphenyl 
lignin with a symbol (H), guaiacyl lignin with a symbol (G), and syringyl lignin 
with a symbol (H), respectively. 
FIGURE 4.1 The structure and synthesis of lignin. 
Barrier Properties of Lignin Nanomaterial 97 4.3 LIGNIN NANOPARTICLES (LNPS) IN THE FOOD-PACKAGING 
INDUSTRY 
As a result of the large size of lignin particles and other factors that control usage, 
the world started to develop methods that can enhance the properties of lignin 
(Schneider et al. 2021). Advanced packaging characteristics like oxygen perme￾ability, moisture permeability, crystalline structure, barrier properties, morphology, 
thermal stability, optical properties, antimicrobial properties, and mechanical 
properties can be achieved by using polymeric materials (matrix) in new technol￾ogies that demand a filler that can react/interact with the existing matrix to create a 
new formularization (Jafarzadeh and Jafari 2020). 
LNPS have a large surface area, which means they have more functional and 
polyphenolic side chains. This increases the surface area of interaction, potentially 
increasing the antibacterial impact. LNPS have the advantages of being “green,” 
readily available, biocompatible, and cheap nanoparticles (Alqahtani et al. 2019). 
Some applications of LNPS have recently been integrated into thermoplastic na￾nocomposites, foams, bactericides, UV-protected products, and others. As a result, 
lignin has been proposed as a recent possible feedstock for manufacturing ecolo￾gically acceptable nanomaterials (Liu et al. 2018). Also, LNPS have a 40% higher 
antioxidant activity than native lignin after testing with 2,2-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl 
(DPPH) (Yang et al. 2016a). 
LNPS embedded in polymer films for food packaging have antibacterial activity 
(Zimniewska et al., 2008). LNPS can improve a film’s mechanical characteristics, 
thermal stability, and UV light barrier while maintaining a reasonable level of 
visible light transparency (Yang et al. 2016b). LNPS have also been utilized to 
increase bacterial membrane adherence as lignin-core NPs doped with Ag+ ions and 
surface stabilized with a cationic electrolyte. Since one of the most common in￾organic nanoparticles is silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), it will focus on its in￾corporation with LNPS. 
The utilization of LNPS in combination with other biopolymers, such as 
starch alginate, gelatin, and synthetic polymers, such as poly (vinyl alcohol), 
poly (ethylene), poly (lactic acid), and poly (vinyl chloride), has also been 
documented in literature. Furthermore, it has been shown that the produced 
packaging material has more antibacterial and mechanical properties (Kovalcik 
et al. 2017). It was found that LNPS could reduce nanocomposites’ transpar￾ency, which leads to enhanced thermal stability. Transparency is an important 
property that can affect not only the quality of food-packaging material and food 
products but also the customer demand by checking the product’s freshness. 
Food-packaging materials should resist any interaction with penetrated light 
(UV and visible). As food packaging has thermal stability, it is more qualified 
and more transparent. 
The light transmittance of nanomaterials reduced dramatically when the con￾centration of LNPS rose from 0.5 wt% to 4.5 wt%. Also, nanocomposite films were 
more UV resistant than pure films due to nanosized lignin’s UV absorption prop￾erties and the polymer matrix’s homogenous dispersion (Zhang et al. 2021). Also, 
LNPS can enhance biological stability and hydrophobic properties, which have 
98 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications been estimated by determining the weight loss rate and contact angle of the samples 
of the new formulas compared to the original forms. The results have shown that the 
antibacterial effect of new formulas has increased, and the addition of LNPS has 
enhanced protective effects on the antimicrobial sample substances in food￾packaging materials have attracted interest since antimicrobial-active films might 
aid in the control of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria (Rhim and Ng 2007). As a 
result, LNPS is thought to be the ideal ingredient for improving the performance of 
other harmful materials used in food packaging. 
4.3.1 MAIN TYPES OF LIGNIN NANOPARTICLES (LNPS) 
Five types of lignin are produced (Figure 4.2): three of them are commonly yielded 
via lifeforce at the commercial scale; lignosulfonate, kraft, and soda lignin. The 
other two types could only be prepared at the small laboratory scale: organosolv and 
enzymatic hydrolysis lignin (Tang et al. 2020). 
• Lignosulfonate 
The lignosulfonate type can be obtained by reacting lignin with sulfite salts 
or sulfurous acids and using counter-ions such as calcium or sodium 
(Doherty et al., 2011; Azadi et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2020). Specifically at 
120°C–180°C, then preservation for 1–5 hours at any pH, whether it be 
neutral, primary, or acidic (Tang et al. 2020). It is used in many 
FIGURE 4.2 Five types of lignin produced. 
Barrier Properties of Lignin Nanomaterial 99 applications, such as dye dispersants and pesticide dispersants because of 
its surface activity and good solubility (Tang et al. 2017; Tang et al. 2020). 
• Kraft lignin 
Kraft lignin type could be obtained under high temperature and pH con￾ditions using sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide at a pH range from 
13–14 at 170°C. The acid precipitation technique is used to get lignin from 
the total solution (Liitiä et al. 2003; Zakzeski et al. 2010; Azadi et al. 2013; 
Tang et al. 2020). 
• Organosolv lignin 
By treating lignocellulosic biomass with the aid of organic solvents such 
as acetone and tetrahydro-furfuryl alcohol (de la Torre et al. 2013; Galkin 
and Samec 2016; Zikeli et al. 2019; Liao et al. 2020; Tang et al. 2020), 
lignin with high purity can be produced compared to other extraction 
techniques and is protected by the standard structure of lignin to be free 
from sulfur (Figueiredo et al. 2018; Haq et al. 2020; Tang et al. 2020). 
• Soda lignin 
This type of lignin is gained by treating lignocellulosic at a temperature 
range from 140°C–170°C using sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and 
anthraquinone as a catalyst (Doherty et al. 2011; Azadi et al. 2013; Galkin 
and Samec 2016; Tang et al. 2020). The produced soda lignin has unique 
characteristics since it is sulfur-free, making it suitable for bioplastic 
production applications (Iravani and Rajender 2020; Tang et al. 2020). 
• Enzymatic hydrolysis lignin 
It utilized hemicellulases and cellulases in an enzymatic hydrolysis process 
to leave lignin only as an insoluble solid remnant. This process is char￾acterized by its low cost and eco-friendliness (Gao and Fatehi 2019; Liao 
et al. 2020; Rico-García et al. 2020; Tang et al. 2020). 
4.3.2 DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF LNPS 
Lignin is detached from lignocellulosic biomass using a variety of methods. Five 
main techniques are used for lignin separation. They are sulfite, kraft, organosolv, 
soda, and enzymatic hydrolysis methods (Liao et al. 2020; Rico-García et al. 2020; 
Tang et al. 2020). However, the product of each method varies in chemical and 
physical characteristics, such as solubility, molecular weight, and functional groups 
affecting the behavior and application of the nanoparticles of lignin (Kumar et al. 
2020; Liao et al. 2020; Rico-García et al. 2020; Tang et al. 2020). 
• Antisolvent precipitation techniques 
Antisolvent precipitation techniques are based on dissolving and re￾precipitating lignin to yield LNPS. It is characterized by simple operations 
and do not need a higher-level tool (Zhang et al. 2021). Lignin is insoluble 
in water and acidic solutions, although it dissolves well in other organic 
solvents like dimethyl formaldehyde (DMF) (Zhao et al. 2016; Anderson 
et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2021). An organic solvent used to maintain the 
solubility of lignin is DMF; in addition, the lignin structure is not affected. 
100 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications LNPS are precipitated from the solution after subjecting it to water as an 
antisolvent (Mishra and Ekielski 2019; Zhang et al. 2021). For example, 
Kraft lignin as a source of lignin, by adding DMF as an organic solvent 
then use water as an antisolvent producing spherical nanoparticles with 
200 nm size (Li et al. 2016; Lievonen et al. 2016; Xiong et al. 2017; Zhang 
et al. 2021). 
• Ultra-sonication technique 
This technique is based on using the ability of ultrasonic waves to cleave 
the molecular bonds of lignin to produce smaller molecular lignin (Sun and 
Tomkinson 2002; Zhang et al. 2021). 
• Homogenization technique 
This technique is based on subjecting lignin particles present in the 
emulsion system to dispersion and homogenization. This will break the 
lignin bonds by sheer force (Nair et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2021). 
4.3.3 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF LNPS 
The molecular weight of lignin and the space between bonds could control the 
shape by which LNPS’ will appear (Österberg et al. 2020; Schneider et al. 2021). 
The shape varies as the bonds may have a sphere shape or an irregular shape 
(Xiong et al. 2017; Schneider et al. 2021). 
The shape of LNPS is fundamental as it affects the behavior and usage. For 
example, the spherical shape of LNPs could be more suitable for biological 
applications since they show an excellent performance if used as carriers for 
hydrophobic substances (Sipponen et al. 2018; Österberg et al. 2020; Schneider 
et al. 2021). 
In addition to that, the stability of LNPs is limited by some factors, such as 
temperature, pH, salt concentration, and others. LNPs showed stability if stored in a 
pH ranges from 5 to 11 and at low salt concentrations (Trevisan and Rezende 2020; 
Schneider et al. 2021). 
• Antimicrobial effect of (LNPS) 
The benzene ring structure and phenol units in lignin, as well as the existence of a 
double bond in α, β positions of the side chain and methyl groups (-C-CH3) in 
position γ, phenolic fragments of lignin, makes lignin a potent antibacterial agent 
against microbes (Yang et al. 2016a; Yang et al. 2018a; Cavallo et al. 2020). It 
also has antibacterial and antioxidant properties. Phenolic units of lignin can 
inhibit bacterial growth and make it available for use in packaging materials 
(Nada et al. 1989). 
Compared to pure non-nanometric lignin, the tiny size of LNPS is favorable to 
antibacterial activity (Yang et al. 2018b; Cavallo et al. 2020; Javed et al. 2021; 
Zhang et al. 2021). 
Lignin can inhibit microorganism growth and culminates in cellular lysis by 
the suppression of enzymes and the disintegration of cell walls because of the 
presence of polyphenols in the structure of lignin (Qin et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2016a; 
Barrier Properties of Lignin Nanomaterial 101 Cavallo et al. 2020). With the number of phenolic side chains, more softening tem￾perature, and better thermal stability than original lignin due to the higher specific 
surface area, LNPS have a more antibacterial effect than the original form of lignin. 
Moreover, they are effective natural support for nanocomposites (Bonilla et al. 2014). 
The new formulas, binary (PVA/LNP and CH/LNP) and ternary (PVA/CH/LNP), 
have an antibacterial effect on plant pathogens so nanocomposite films, such as 
chitosan (CH) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), can be employed in sophisticated food 
packaging (Yang et al. 2016c). 
4.3.3.1 The Mechanism of LNPS as an Antimicrobial Agent 
Because of their tiny size, LNPS can enter bacterial cells, bypassing the cell 
membrane, and certain monophenolic chemicals generated from lignin, such as 
cinnamaldehyde, which can lower intracellular pH, causing cell death (Yang et al. 
2018a; Cavallo et al. 2020). 
An antibacterial nanocomposite film is especially eligible because of its nano￾composite matrix’s appropriate structural integrity, barrier characteristics, and the 
antibacterial capabilities provided by natural antimicrobial compounds embedded 
inside (Rhim and Ng 2007). 
Prokaryotic bacteria such as llsteria monocytogenes, E. coli, and pseudomonas 
aeruginosa can be efficiently killed by LNPS. These bacteria are considered the 
most common types and can be critical in the food industry (Rai et al. 2009). 
• Antioxidant activity of lignin nanoparticles 
LNPS has gotten much interest lately because of its renewable and plentiful green 
supply, UV absorption capabilities, biodegradability, antioxidant, biocompatibility, 
and other factors (Beisl et al. 2017). It has a complicated chemical structure in its 
natural state, consisting of aromatic rings with methoxy and hydroxyl groups, and it is 
reported to have antioxidant properties (Kai et al. 2016; Schneider et al. 2021). The 
antioxidant activity of lignin is boosted when it is converted into a nanoparticle 
(García et al. 2010; Schneider et al. 2021). More phenolic groups can justify this on 
the nanoparticle’s surface, which will react with the radical (DPPH) and reduce it 
(Trevisan and Rezende 2020). LNPS has shown more radical-scavenging activity 
(RSA), superoxide radical-scavenging activity (SRSA), water solubility, and reducing 
power (Lu et al. 2012). 
On the other hand, they have a more vital radical scavenging ability than their parent 
polymers. DPPH radical scavenging activity has been used to investigate the antioxidant 
capacity of lignin nanoparticles in chitosan (CH) films/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) for 
active packaging (Yang et al. 2016a). Incorporating LNPS into PVA and CH films 
significantly improved, highlighting the antioxidation response and scavenging activity. 
• Anti-ultraviolet effect 
Lignin can absorb a broad spectrum of UV light and diminish ultraviolet radiation 
because of phenolic and ketonic groups in its structure. Also, this is gaining its ex￾ceptional antioxidant and anti-ultraviolet characteristics (Becker and Wittmann 2019). 
102 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications It has been discovered that using lignin at the nanoscale improves this feature. 
The UV protectant activity of LNPS was shown to be up to 30% higher than that of 
non-nanolignin against E. coli, (Yang et al. 2016a; Yearla and Padmasree 2016). It 
has been discovered that light transmittance exists in the visible light from the UV 
and visible light-blocking capabilities of chitosan (CH), grafted polylactic acid (g￾PLA), Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and neat polylactic acid (PLA), decreased by the 
application of LNPS. 
At a wavelength of 550 nm, the percentage reduces from 89% to 56%, with 3 wt 
% of LNPS. in the UV region (below 400 nm) of the spectra, transmittance below 
2% was reached for the LNP containing wheat gluten (WG) and PVA samples 
(Yang et al. 2016c). 
• Water vapor permeability (WVP) 
Among the essential roles of a food-packaging film is to restrict moisture trans￾mission from the surrounding environment to the food; determining the perme￾ability of the film to water vapor is crucial, and this value must be kept as low as 
feasible (Jafarzadeh et al. 2015). The incorporation of metal NPs in packaging has 
been shown to inhibit the transfer of water into food items in studies on the ap￾plicability of nanocomposite films in food packaging. WVP may have decreased 
due to the robust and effective interaction between biopolymers and NPs and a 
higher degree of crystallinity, which reduced the intermolecular gap between 
polymeric chains, resulting in more resistance to water molecules moving through 
the films. 
• Oxygen permeability (OP) 
Food-packaging materials must be resistant to oxygen to be used; hence, they must 
have adequate mass-exchange characteristics. Excessive oxygen penetration into 
oil-containing food items can badly affect the deterioration of value, quality, nu￾tritional content, as well as the deterioration of fragrance, flavor, texture, a color 
change, and rancidity, which reduce the food’s value, quality, and shelf life 
(Wihodo and Moraru 2013). As a result, it is critical to keep an eye on oxygen 
transfer in food-packaging systems to maintain food quality and value. Increasing 
the amount of NPS in a film can increase its oxygen barrier qualities. Because NPS 
is impervious to gases compared to polymers, their inclusion into a bio/polymer 
matrix has been extensively studied for their gas barrier qualities. The oxygen 
barrier property was dramatically reduced (62%). A comparable improvement was 
also recorded with a 5% increase in OP. 
• Metal nanoparticles influence the water resistance of food packaging 
composites 
Moisture absorption, moisture content, solubility, contact angle, and wettability 
might be considered some of the essential water-resistant properties in biopoly￾mers for practical applications. Due to the hydrophilic nature of those 
Barrier Properties of Lignin Nanomaterial 103 macromolecules, this feature distinguishes these biopolymers from more common 
synthetic polymers (Ahmad et al. 2016). Finally, films have a reduced moisture 
content and solubility, and they are a good fit for the food-packaging business 
because they can withstand high levels of ambient moisture during handling and 
storage. 
• Metal nanoparticles and their effect on the mechanical characteristics 
of food-packaging composites 
Mechanical properties such as elongation at break, elastic modulus, and tensile 
strength (TS) are important for food-packaging materials because they must preserve 
their integrity during distribution, storage, processing, and handling. Food goods 
are frequently packaged to protect them from mechanical stress. Furthermore, the 
texture of food items during consumption and transit is affected by the mechanical 
strength of food packaging (Ahmad et al. 2016). 
• The influence of metal nanoparticles on the optical properties 
of food-packaging composites 
Food quality is dependent primarily on resistance to UV and visible light and the 
optical properties of packaging materials (transparency, UV transmission/absor￾bance, and color). As a result, the container must shield the contents from UV light 
to avoid lipid oxidation, prevent food discoloration, and maintain food nutrients. 
Furthermore, the color of food-packaging impacts customer acceptance, and it is 
among the essential characteristics of films that might affect their usage (Jafarzadeh 
et al. 2017). 
4.4 THE MODIFICATION OF FOOD PACKAGING PLASTIC 
MATERIALS USING LIGNIN NANOPARTICLES (LNPS) 
About 240 million tonnes of plastics are transformed from 4% of the total pet￾roleum; most of them are polymers used as packaging materials. The low weight 
and low price of petroleum-based plastics are desirable properties in the plastic 
industry. Nevertheless, the pollution resulting from plastic usage due to its slow 
rate of degradation and weak recycling ability is a big issue that prompts sci￾entists to modify these packaging materials through nanotechnology. LNPS are 
potentially valuable biological enhancements for polymer nanocomposite films 
that can be employed in improved food packaging (Zhang et al. 2021). Employing 
the antioxidant properties of LNPS and their ability to shield polymers against 
thermo-oxidation and UV degradation, LNPS are suggested to be integrated into 
polymers for reinforcement (Kun and Pukánszky 2017). (Figure 4.3) (Table 4.1). 
4.4.1 POLYVINYL ALCOHOL (PVA) 
Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is synthesized by hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate (Razzak 
et al., 2001). While being a petroleum-derived artificial polymer, it is a form of 
104 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications biodegradable resin. Therefore, it is highly recommended for the food-packaging 
industry (Mingxian Liu et al. 2014; Gaaz et al. 2015) because it is a semi-crystalline 
plastic that’s also highly polar, nontoxic, and biodegradable (Kubo and Kadla 2003; 
Duarah et al. 2020). It also has excellent hydrophilicity, organic compatibility, 
processability, solvent resistance, strong chemical resistance, and mechanical 
characteristics (Pengju Liu et al. 2014). On the other hand, it has some constraints 
like poor thermal stability, high moisture absorption, low biodegradation rate, low 
capacity to resist UV light, bit barrier, thermal qualities, and a high cost of PVA, 
making it unsuitable for food packaging. It must be modified to be more beneficial 
in the packaging industry (Zhou et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2016c; Luzi et al. 2019; 
Yang et al. 2021). 
All these constraints restrict its functionalities. However, PVA can be blended 
with other polymers like “LNPS” because of its excellent compatibility with 
various polymer mixtures (Nair et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2018a; Yang et al. 2020a), 
making them functional in many industrial applications and “food packaging” 
(Hu et al. 2016) by improve the properties of mechanical strength and thermal 
stability, also enhance the UV irradiation resistance (Nair et al. 2014; Duarah 
et al. 2020) besides the antioxidant and antibacterial characteristics. The nano￾spheres (LNPS) are prepared by the self-assembly method to produce nano￾composite films of lignin nanospheres (LNPS/PVA) (Xiong et al. 2018). The 
films that are produced by solvent casting (He et al. 2019) are transparent in 
visible light and have UV-absorbing solid qualities. Also, lignin nanospheres 
provide a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic shell that create hydrogen bond in￾teractions between the nanospheres and the hydroxyl groups of PVA. This 
property leads to good dispersion of LNPS into PVA films. Therefore, the LNPS/ 
PVA nanocomposite films are considered a promising candidate for food 
packaging applications (Xiong et al. 2018).

Barrier Properties of Lignin Nanomaterial 105 • Improving the efficiency of chitosan (CH) and PVA by incorporation 
of LNPS 
As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, it is known that LNPS are more 
efficient than original lignin, so these lignin-based nanoparticles can support ap￾plication in the biomedical and industrial fields (Tang et al. 2020). 
“CH” is considered a polysaccharide made from deacetylated chitin (Khan and 
Alamry 2021). Chitin is the structural element that forms the exoskeleton of sea 
crustaceans like shrimp. Chitosan is structurally composed of the deacetylated unit 
and acetylated unit in the form of β-(1–4)-linked to d-glucosamine, the deacetylated 
unit N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, which is the acetylated unit (Yang et al. 2016a). 
According to the excellent biological performance of CH as an antioxidant and

106 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications antibacterial agent, its good biodegradability and biocompatibility, chitosan is used 
in biomedical applications and also in industrial applications like food packaging 
(Crini and Badot 2008). In comparison to PVA, CH has some disadvantages that 
restrict its applications, like poor mechanical and thermal properties, high cost, and 
low surface area (Crini and Badot 2008). 
PVA/LNPS nanocomposites films are produced by solvent casting (He et al. 
2019). The obtained antioxidant activity of the PVA, CH, and LNPS system enables 
LNPS incorporated with CH or/and PVA to be used in food packaging as an ex￾cellent antioxidative agent (Yang et al. 2018b). The structural investigations re￾vealed an excellent dispersion and outstanding interfacial adhesion in between the 
compounds of LNP and PVA. CH, as well as PVA/CH combination, generats an 
outstanding improvement in mechanical properties. LNP acts as nucleation spe￾cialists in PVA in addition to the boundary, uncommonly slacking warm corruption 
of twofold besides ternary framework nanocomposites (Duarah et al. 2020). The 
efficiency of LNPS has been shown in thermal stability that increased when these 
LNPS are incorporated with PVA (Nair et al. 2014). It was found that LNPS is 
effective as an antioxidative release agent when working synergistically with CH in 
the PVA/CH system (Yang et al. 2016c). The synergistic antioxidation response of 
LNPS, CH, and PVA has been determined by measuring DPPH radical scavenging 
activity. DPPH is the free radical that is reduced into a yellow-colored compound 
“diphenylpicrylhydrazine” in the presence of antioxidants (Enayat and Banerjee 
2009). The pure PVA sample has been shown no DPPH radical scavenging activity, 
but the pure CH without LNPS has shown some DPPH radical scavenging activity 
about 20.3% (Yang et al. 2016a). Furthermore, this can explain the interaction of 
free amino groups (NH2) of some amino acids found in CH with the free radicals to 
create balanced radicals (Yen et al. 2008). On the other hand, when CH/PVA are 
blended with LNPS in different weights (1 and 3 wt%), two different systems 
binary (PVA & LNPS or CH & LNPS) and ternary (PVA/CH/LNPS), the RSA 
values increased in a remarkable way where the ternary system of PVA/CH/LNPS 
show higher RSA value than the binary system (Yang et al. 2016c; Yang et al. 
2018b). The outcome shows that the parallel nanocomposite films of PVA/LNP in 
addition to CH/LNP, besides the ternary PVA/CH/LNP, could altogether repress the 
development of plant microbes (Yang et al. 2016a). It has been found that CH and 
LNPS have antibacterial effects (at their maximum concentrations) as potential 
active agents in a food-active packaging solution against two plant/fruit diseases, 
pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. odoriferum and xanthomonas arboricola pv. 
pruni. (Yang et al. 2016a). 
Also, the transmittance of light in the visible spectrum is reduced when LNPS 
are included. When measured at a specific wavelength of (550 nm), the measure￾ment was found to drop to 56% for WG containing 3 wt% LNPS from 89% for neat 
WG. The samples containing LNP, PVA, and WG have a transmittance of <2% in 
the ultraviolet region. UV transmittance is measured at 320 nm wavelength for 
PVA, including 3 wt% LNPS. Moreover, it shows a reduction from 90.79% to 
0.39% using solvent casting for manufacturing films of binary in addition to a 
ternary polymer that may include LNPS, PVA, and CH. Ternary mixtures exhibited 
a transmittance of 0.87% at 320 nm (Yang et al. 2016c). 
Barrier Properties of Lignin Nanomaterial 107 • Improving the efficiency of PVA/nano-lignin (LNP) films using dif￾ferent substances 
PVA/nano-lignin (LNP) nanocomposite films are modified by cross-linking using 
Glutaraldehyde (GD) and citric acid (CA). The results show better thermal stability 
and mechanical properties in addition to solid wettability behavior. The results also 
show higher antibacterial activity than PVA-LNP films. Furthermore, GA cross￾link’s PVA-LNP nanocomposite films show better antibacterial activity than films 
cross-linked by citric acid. This strategy indicates the ability to produce active food 
packaging systems (Weijun Yang et al. 2021). PVA/nano-lignin nanocomposite 
films can also be modified by adding cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and glutar￾aldehyde through the acid hydrolysis method (Weijun Yang et al. 2015b). This 
modification leads to enhanced thermal stability and mechanical properties. The 
wettability behavior has improved due to induced cross-linking interactions be￾tween LNP and PVA. “Radical scavenging activity” (RSA) technique, as well as the 
UV shielding action of migratory components in LNP-PVA nanocomposites, also 
improved. Furthermore, the nanofillers might act as impermeable physical barriers 
to produce a convoluted channel, forcing water vapor to take tortuous routes, 
producing improved water-barrier effectiveness. Finally, the developed PVA films 
may rival active antioxidant materials for food packaging resistant to UV radiation 
(Yang et al. 2020a). In alkali lignin/PVA films, glutaraldehyde has been used as a 
crosslinker and glycerin as a plasticizer (Su et al. 2013; Yang et al. 2020b). Findings 
indicate that under the best reaction circumstances, the realized films had good 
mechanical and thermal stability, with cast films showing enhanced and appropriate 
mechanical characteristics with a particular mass ratio of alkali lignin, glutar￾aldehyde, glycerol in addition to PVA (Yang et al. 2016c; Yang et al. 2020b). A 
nanostructured biomimetic polymeric film was created by adding lignosulfonate 
acid to a PVA matrix without any modifications, achieving high toughness (172 
Jg−1) and strain at the break values of greater than 280% (Yang et al. 2020b; Zhang 
et al., 2021). 
4.4.2 POLYLACTIC ACID (PLA) 
“Polylactic acid” (PLA) is a promising material as it is renewable and available 
commercially with outstanding mechanical characteristics and good transparency 
properties (Jonoobi et al. 2010; Jamshidian et al. 2012). However, it has some 
defects that hinder its efficiency as a packaging material, such as poor gas 
barrier properties, high brittleness, low softening temperature, weak water vapor, 
lousy moisture sensitivity, beforehand physical aging, in addition to feeble im￾pact resistance (Yang et al. 2020a). When PLA is used as a nanofiller substance, 
it modifies LNPS properties such as a lower gas barrier property. Also, it can 
overcome PLA limitations to make it a more attractive industrial material 
(Martino et al. 2010; Fortunati et al. 2014). This is because the LNPS enhances 
the “radical scavenging activity” of the renewable filler (Ge et al. 2014), and it 
improves the mechanical and thermal properties of polymers as in PLA polymer 
108 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications (Yang et al. 2015a). Additionally, when toughness and elongation increase in 
PLA/LNPS, the water vapor transmission rate decreases. As a result, PLA/LNPS 
films are believed to have an excellent UV resistance behavior (Yang et al. 
2020a) in addition to good antimicrobial activity (Richter et al. 2015). Previous 
studies state that other modifications are done to PLA/LNPS films to improve 
the utilization of these films in the food-packaging industry. The first mod￾ification is done when the LNP, as well as cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), have 
been dispersed in neat PLA and grafted PLA (g-PLA) with glycidyl methacry￾late (GMA) with different ratios of LNP, CNC, and PLA to synthesize and 
evaluate high-performance PLA-based nanocomposites. This modification leads 
to improved biocidal activity of PLA films containing CNC and LNP when they 
are assayed against plant pathogen bacteria. 
Also, the films of PLA/Lignocellulose affirmed the synergic action of CNC in 
addition to LNP nanoparticles in UV spectrum-blocking ability and transpar￾ency. They also proved to be effective in enhancing nucleation and improving 
crystal growth while acquiring better mechanical efficiency (Yang et al. 2016b). 
Thud, films of PLA that are mixed with CNC and LNP nanoparticles are highly 
suggested to be used in the food packaging industry as they provide good an￾tibacterial activity with mechanical properties. Another modification of PLA 
films that are mixed with CNC and LNP nanoparticles is done by using um￾belliferone (UMB) as active ingredients (AIs) because of its antioxidant action. 
The construction of the multilayer polymeric systems method has been used to 
improve and modify the shelf-life of food items. Wettability and overall mi￾gration characterization found that the films acquired higher antioxidant cap￾ability because of the synergistic action of LNP and UMB. In this study, most of 
the samples confirmed the European Commission (EU) standards for plastic 
materials designed to handle food components for the overall migration test. The 
monolayers of PLA films created an efficient barrier effect that improves both 
bilayer films’ overall migration effectiveness due to proper dispersion of the 
nanofillers in monolayers of PLA films. Concerning the wettability test, parti￾cular films showed the least wettability. This is due to non-polar particles such 
as LNP and UMB. Finally, all the produced films were found to be hydrophobic, 
antioxidant, and biodegradable. These features are significant for the materials 
used in food-packaging applications. Consequently, these antioxidant packaging 
systems incorporating biodegradable and bio-based polymers may provide a 
sustainable and environmentally beneficial option for film applications, including 
food packaging (Iglesias-Montes et al. 2021). A recent modification focuses on 
the importance of incorporating cinnamaldehyde (Ci) with LNP in PLA films 
through supercritical impregnation. The results of this study showed that in￾corporating LNP and the active ingredient (Ci) influenced the thermal, me￾chanical, and colorimetric characteristics producing plastic materials with good 
biodegradability and UV-spectrum barrier characters when correlated to PLA 
films. Also, the disintegration percentage was greater than 90% for all bio-nano 
composites, and these results verified the biodegradability of the produced na￾nocomposites (Cerro et al. 2021). 
Barrier Properties of Lignin Nanomaterial 109 4.4.3 MACROALGAE 
Another bioplastic material utilized in food-industry applications as an alternative 
for petroleum-based polymers is macroalgae. LNPS were used to strengthen the 
macroalgae Kappaphycus alvarezii. LNPS are used to fill macroalgae polymers 
to decrease macroalgae brittleness and hydrophilicity (Rizal et al. 2021). The 
mechanical, structural, thermal, physical, morphological, and water-barrier 
properties of the produced films were enhanced by incorporating purified and 
un-purified LNPS into bioplastic films of macroalgae. This improvement in the 
previous properties of LNP incorporated macroalgae films was found because of 
the miscibility and high compatibility, which is due to the good interfacial in￾teraction between the matrix and nanofiller (LNP). On the other hand, highly 
purified LNPS were found to have a higher reinforcing impact on macroalgae 
polymers than LNPS that are not purified; this improvement is also influenced by 
the surface charge of particles, particle size, and the free accessible hydroxyl 
groups (Rizal et al. 2021). 
As a result, the created LNPS/macroalgae bioplastic sheets will replace existing 
petroleum-derived plastics in many industrial applications, notably food-packaging 
materials. 
4.4.4 SILVER NANAOPARTICLES (AGNPS) 
Using lignin as a filler in nanocomposite films and as a reducing and stabilizing agent 
for AgNPs makes AgNPs more promising as a packaging material (Shankar and Rhim 
2017). AgNPS has been used in several commercial items because of its strong 
temperature resistance, ease of use, and broad spectrum of antibacterial activity 
(Sharma et al. 2009; Jaiswal et al. 2010). DurethamVR and KodakVR are a company 
that uses AgNPS in polymer packaging. They found that about “0.01 mg/kg com￾mission” this releasing rate of AgNPS in the food medium (Wesley et al. 2014). 
Because of excellent surface area, fair optical and catalytic characters, as well as 
magnetic and electric properties with excellent thermal stability, in addition to wide 
spectrum of antimicrobial action, AgNPs is considered one of the most employed 
metallic nanoparticles in manufacturing nanocomposite in applications of food 
packaging in addition to biomedical operations (Duncan 2011; Rhim, Park, and Ha 
2013). AgNPs’ antibacterial efficacy is mainly determined by size, composition, 
concentration, specific microorganism species, and finally, the form of nanoparticles. 
For the exceedingly great specificity, these nanoparticles are more efficient in inter￾acting with the cell membranes of bacteria due to their large surface area. The es￾sential properties of food-packaging materials that are highly needed for excellent 
quality, safety, and increasing the shelf-life of food are the packaging materials’ 
antimicrobial activity (Falguera et al. 2011). This property can be enhanced in the 
packaging system by integrating antimicrobial agents as AgNPs (Kanmani and Rhim 
2014). Since AgNPs are frequently used in producing nanocomposites used in food￾packaging applications (Duncan 2011; Rhim, Park, and Ha 2013). Moreover, lignin 
has polar sulfonate groups, and this group is responsible for the excellent dispersion of 
any produced nanoparticles in aqueous solutions (Monties 1991; Shankar et al. 2015). 
110 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications The films have high antibacterial action against food-borne pathogenic microorgan￾isms and can be applied in food-packaging applications (Shankar and Rhim 2017). It 
was found that the mechanical and UV-spectrum barrier and water vapor barrier 
characters of lignin-AgNPS films were enhanced when lignin was incorporated with 
AgNPS. The optimum concentration of AgNPS was proved to be 1 wt% of AgNPs, at 
which the mechanical property and water vapor barrier property of films were im￾proved. Also, films of (lignin-AgNPS) have great antibacterial action against pa￾thogenic bacteria that cause food-borne as escherichia coli in addition to listeria 
monocytogenes (Shankar and Rhim 2017). Richter et al. (2015) created antibacterial 
LNPS injected with silver in the form of ions and covered with a layer of cationic 
polyelectrolyte. The antimicrobial action of lignin encapsulated AgNPs was studied 
by Marulasiddeshwara et al. (2017). These particles were reported to have anti￾microbial action toward the human pathogens as “staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, and 
aspergillus niger,” with an inhibition zone of 10%, 12%, and 80% percentages, re￾spectively (Marulasiddeshwara et al. 2017). 
4.5 CONCLUSIONS 
Food-packaging materials are considered the most important factors in the food 
industry since they play an essential role in the quality and health of food. 
Efficient food-packaging materials help in protecting food products from harmful 
things such as contamination and physical damage. The synthesis and quality of 
these packaging materials affect human health and food quality dramatically. 
Production of packaging materials with good quality generated from renewable 
sources that are ecofriendly, biodegradable, or compostable, and recycling can 
minimize pollution and be achieved by incorporating nanotechnology techniques 
in this field. 
Nanotechnology methods are used to generate LNPS from Lignin. LNPS have 
good properties to qualify them to be good packaging materials, especially be￾cause of their physical and mechanical properties. LNPS also gain better 
properties on mixing with other substances such as PVA, PLA, CH, and AgNPs 
like antibacterial action, fairwater vapor permeability, enhance mechanical 
properties.

5.1 INTRODUCTION 
In recent times, synthetic plastics based on fossil fuel are creating huge environ￾mental pollution through packaging products, which are mainly made from non￾biodegradable plastics. Therefore, developmental studies on biopolymers produced 
from various agricultural products and/or food waste are thus needed. Starch has the 
best potential to be used as biofilm-forming agents among the biopolymers used to 
apply coatings and films since it is cheap and abundant. Many studies show that 
starch-based coatings and films can be produced with different mechanical, thermal, 
and biological properties, depending on the different natural sources, such as ve￾getables or plant stems. Such studies on carbohydrate starches and their promising 
products are discussed in detail this chapter. 
5.1.1 CLASSIFICATION OF BIOPLASTICS (BASED ON STARCH) 
The bioplastics obtained from different natural resources can be classified based on 
different standards (Rahman 2019). A typical classification of bioplastics and starch￾based biopolymers is shown in Figure 5.1. Here, one classification system based on 
their source splits the bioplastics into three primary categories (Rahman 2019). 
i. Natural polymers (polymers derived from biomass). 
ii. Synthetic polymers (polymers chemically synthesized from renewable 
sources). 
iii. Microbial polymers (polymers derived from microorganisms). 
FIGURE 5.1 Classifications of bio-plastics and starch-based biopolymers. 
122 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications • Natural polymers (polymers derived from biomass) 
Biodegradable biopolymers obtained by fermentation are associated with mi￾crobially produced polyesters and neutral polysaccharides, providing access to 
carbon supply reserves and energy sources, such as starch, cellulose, chitosan, 
and gum, and so on (Encalada 2018). The biopolymers are extracted from 
various natural agricultural, animal, and marine sources. The natural biopoly￾mers contain polysaccharides (e.g., cellulose, starch, gums, chitosan, and so on), 
derived from plants (e.g., soya, gluten and so on), animal proteins and fats 
(e.g., collagen, casein, gelatin and so on, including cross linked fats). However, 
many biopolymers are transparent and hydrophilic, which causes some diffi￾culties when processed in saturated food packaging (Rahman 2019). One of 
the main advantages of the biopolymers is their heat resistance. Their melting 
point is about 175°C (Encalada 2018). However, it requires outstanding gas 
barrier properties suitable for use in food packaging (Rahman 2019). Starch is 
one of the largest polymers, owing to its intrinsic biodegradability, abundant 
push, and annual regeneration. A classification of natural polymers is shown 
in Figure 5.2. 
• Starch 
Starch, a main storage formed from plant carbohydrate, is easily biodegradable 
in nature and can be incurred from various natural sources (Copeland et al. 
2009). It is present generally in wheat, maize, oats, sago, barley, rice, potato, 
cassava, and so on. It is regularly used as a thermoplastic and creates an ad￾ditional flexibility for polystyrene (PS). Starch is a giant bioplastic, used for 
packaging due to its fairly low price, high biodegradability, and good accessi￾bility. It is cheap and biodegradable. Therefore, it has generated growing interest 
among scientists or researchers as one of the components for cheap bioplastics 
(Encalada 2018). However, its medium wetness and poor mechanical property 
FIGURE 5.2 Classifications of natural polymers. 
Modified Hydrophobic Nano Starch 123 restrict it from many uses. Hence, starch is mixed with several biopolymers and 
certain additives to improve those properties. Potatoes are the fourth most 
prevalent food crop in the world, following wheat, rice, and corn. Because 
elements are present as starch, vitamin C, vitamin A, and mineral composites, 
potatos are considered an influential nourishment. The potato is the most im￾portant food, whereas starch present as an ingredient is important to the starch 
industries (Pramanik et al. 2020). In this context, different natural sources of 
starch samples are listed in Table 5.1. 
5.1.2 PLASTIC AND ENVIRONMENT 
Plastics become a necessary part of our everyday survives in today’s life 
(Shafqat et al. 2020). The synthetic polymers are made from petro-chemical 
sources, which are nonrenewable and non-biodegradable (Axelsson et al. 2012). 
Thus, synthetic polymers may be swallowed by different marine animals or 
creatures, and sometimes, the polymers get entangled in them. Therefore, the 
waste plastics create several issues to the entire environment (Li et al. 2016). 
On the other hand, abundant high-performance durable plastics have been 
manufactured, and thus, environmental pollution is growing proportionally 
(Welden 2020). The consumer market needs a lot of plastic goods for our 
regular lives (P. Li et al. 2021). The amount of plastic contamination is also 
increased by carry bags or containers of various crops. In contrast, bioplastics 
are likesynthetic plastics as well as eco-friendly plastics, and are considered as 
potential novel organic materials to overcome the environmental issues (Atiwesh 
et al. 2021).

124 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 5.1.3 STARCH AS A SUSTAINABLE POLYMER 
The starch-bioplastics are complex mixtures of biodegradable plastics, such as 
polylactic acid (PLA), polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), polybutylene 
succinate (PBS), polycaprolactone (PCL), and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). The 
combined mixture of starch with other plastics makes the starch-bioplastics better in 
water confrontation, as well as improved mechanical and processing characteristics 
(Gadhave et al. 2018; Rahman 2019). Since the starch-bioplastics are recyclable and 
compostable polymer with various chemicals, they offer a huge potential as a best 
source for multipurpose usages (Ashok et al. 2016). In 2015, nearly 269 × 106 tons 
of plastic products were manufactured globally. That means that the consumption of 
packing products per resident appraised was 45 kg. Besides food consumption, 
other plastics products are used as apparatuses in paper binders, glues, 
fermentation-feedstock, chemicals, fabrics, and many other industrial goods. As the 
use of plastic packaging is reportedly growing, the environmental pollution will also 
be increasing (Pelissari et al. 2019). The poor thermal stability, high reactivity, and 
hydrophilicity, as well as breakability of the starch, restrict it from wide applica￾tions for industrial polymer, which needs to design the various properties, including 
mechanical veracity (Ojogbo et al. 2020). At present, the growth of renewable or 
maintainable plastics is a hedge to the industry. However, the synthetic plastics 
will be expensive in the future due to the lack of sources and intense hikes in 
petroleum costs (Glenn et al. 2014). 
5.1.4 STARCH PROPERTIES 
The enzymatic hydrolysis properties of starch hosts are usually determined by α￾amylase (Li and Wei 2020). Many of starches comprise 20%–30% amylose and 
70%–75% amylopectin. The waxy rice contains <2% amylose and less amount 
of amylose (0%–8%) but the corn starch contains up to 50% amylose (Obadi and 
Xu 2021). 
• Mechanical Properties 
The starch-bioplastics are employed for industrial purposes. In this context, their 
mechanical and other influential properties have been trying to improve (Chaléat 
et al. 2014). In starch-bioplastics, mechanical characteristics are more significant to 
preserve their barrier behaviour (Bertuzzi et al. 2012). Mechanical characteristics, 
including tensile strength, modulus, and elongation at failure should be optimal to 
control the several properties, such as film’s integrity and water barrier of the 
starch-film during its handling and transportation (Jha et al. 2020). The mechanical 
properties of starch-based films and thermoplastic starch (TPS) are illustrated in 
Table 5.2. 
Amylopectin is more sensitive than amylose to the plasticity. The mechanical 
behaviour of the films holding glycerol is generally remained between 40% and 100% 
of amylose (Chaléat et al. 2014). The stress-strain nature of the clear plasticized 
amylopectin and amylose films is shown in Figure 5.3 (Quitadamo et al. 2017).

Modified Hydrophobic Nano Starch 127 Due to the hydrophilicity of the starch, the internal contact and morphology of 
the starch are immediately changed by the water particles. Its glass-transition 
temperature (Tg) and mechanical properties depends on the water molecules. The Tg 
of natural starch was found between 60 and 80 °C, depending upon its water 
fraction content from 0.12 to 0.14 (Lu et al. 2009). The nature of stress-strain 
behaviours of some plasticized starch-based films are shown in Figure 5.4

and 20 wt% water; adopted from Ref. ( Quitadamo et al. 2017).

with the various percentage of glycerol are depicted in Figure 5.5. 
• Thermal Properties 
The conversion from crystalline (i.e., granular starch) to the dispersion (i.e., 
amorphous state) phase is known as gelatinization (Jane 1995). A differential 
scanning calorimeter (DSC) is employed to determine the gelatinization properties 
of the starches. The starch gelatinization point interrupts the natural structure of its 
particles (Talja et al. 2008). Thermal properties of acetylated starches from several 
plants’ resources are shown in Table 5.3. 
Generally, natural starch obtained from tubers and roots has a lesser gelatine 
temperature compared to the grains (viz., corn, wheat, and rice). Moreover, starch 
alteration makes the changes in gelatinization property by decreasing the tem￾perature and heat content values compared to its natural resembling part (Perez and 
Edith 2017). The decrease in the thermal properties of the altered starch by acet￾ylation depends on further external aspects for the feedback, form, and dimensions 
of the particles, the relation between amylose and amylopectin, the crystals struc￾ture, and the structure of amylopectin clusters (El Halal et al. 2015). The acetyl set 
into the polymer chains results in disruption of the granular construction; hence, it 
increases the bulging chain and reduces the gelatinization temperature (Singh et al. 
2002). Gelatinization enthalpy of native and hydrolyzed starches is illustrated in 
Table 5.4. The change in temperature and the amount of enthalpy (ΔHgel) reduced 
in corn starch are lower compared to potato starch. It can be due to the solidness of 
the corn flour particles and the presence of fats (Singh et al. 2002). 
FIGURE 5.5 Stress-strain plots of pea-starch film plasticized with glycerol indicate that the 
strain of the starch film was reduced by the incorporation of 10% glycerol. Compare this with 
transparent starch film, where the starch film contains 25% glycerol showing a high flexible 
behaviour ( Zhang and Han 2010).

130 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications After starch is heated in the presence of additional liquid, it undergoes a con￾version stage called gelatinization. Further, the gelatinization behavior shows 
temperature gap equivalent to separate type of starch (Alcázar et al. 2015). 
• Biological Properties 
Nanotechnology has currently attracted significant attention and diligent efforts 
because of its substantial nature in the farming and manufacturing industries of 
edible products. It provides the starch to progress sustenance superiority and pro￾tection. The exclusive properties of nanomaterials simplify their usage in medicinal, 
cosmetics, wastewater treatment, and other areas (Krystyjan et al. 2021). 
5.1.5 THE GREEN CONTEXT 
The “green” term was introduced to the market in the 1980s to focus the environ￾mental issues for taking advantage of competitive business and growing into the recent 
term “green paradigm” (Mironescu et al. 2021). There is a strong relation between the 
green packaging and other green concepts, which are depicted in Figure 5.6. 
The “green” composites generally do not promote any skin irritation during their 
manufacturing, unlike the traditional artificial composites based on conventional 
resources. Recently, the advantageous characteristics of several “green” composites 
have been reported and disseminated, including journals, textbooks, conference 
proceedings, and even some industrial magazines. In this context, the nano starch 
has shown as one of the best biopolymers being used as matrix or reinforcement/ 
filler in the production of “green” composites (Satyanarayana et al. 2016). Besides 
chitosan, nano starch is the most naturally abundant polysaccharide, which is 
FIGURE 5.6 Concept of green technology.

(Shehabeldine et al. 2019). In Andean ecosystems, different parameters for the 
natural Andean crops are considered as potential variables for different types of 
starch sources (Torres et al. 2011). 
For biopolymer, compostable resources are biodegraded at composting en￾vironments. In industrial composting situations, temperature is required to raise up 
to 55 – 60˚C under high relative humidity (RH) and the occurrence of oxygen. As a 
result, the composting materials can be converted to the most optimal level when 
compared to other degradation conditions, including, soil, surface water, or marine 
water. Compliance of EN13432 is measured as a suitable quantity for the industrial 
biodegradability for packaging materials. The EN13432 is a standard measurement 
method of testing for biodegradable packaging plastics (Gadhave et al. 2018). 
5.1.6 GREEN CHEMICAL TREATMENTS OF THE STARCH-BASED FILMS 
According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the “green chemical” is 
developed and designed to reduce or eliminate the activation of chemicals and 
processes used and production of hazardous substances to the health of humans and 
the environment (Mironescu et al. 2021). Similarly, the chemical properties of 
plasticizers and any other additives also must be properly identified to verify their 
chemical compatibility with suitable biopolymers. The film-making mechanisms 
and the transformation properties of nano starch into film are very important to 
control the structure of the film-using plasticizers (Han and Aristippo 2005). 
Mixing of starch with non-biodegradable polymers, including polyethylene (PE), 
is a fruitful techniques for enhancing the melting point and other properties of ther￾moplastic starch, but the amount of PE contents should be optimal. This new form of 
PE is termed green polyethylene, which is recently available in the market. The green 
polyethylene can be produced from sugarcane, which is a renewable material. Hence, 
it seems an appropriate material to mix with nano starch for marketing (as “green” 
materials) and as eco-friendly for the environment (Pervaiz et al. 2014). 
5.1.7 HYDROPHOBIC STARCH-BASED COMPOSITE AND NANOCOMPOSITE 
Hydrophobic starch has higher water absorption resistance than hydrophilic starch. 
Nano starches and their natural fibers are similar in their chemistry. Hence, they 
have good compatibility and also strong bonding, which leads them to achieve a 
good stress-transfer capacity in their composite system. By addition of reinforce￾ments to the nano starch matrix, the performance of nano starch-based composites 
can be improved significantly (Soykeabkaew et al. 2015). Generally, the starch 
films have poor mechanical properties, are brittle, and have high water or moisture 
sensitivity owing to their high hydrophilicity compared to the synthetic polymers. 
Therefore, the mechanical properties and resistance to water or moisture absorption 
of the starch can be modified or improved by converting them into nanomaterials by 
several techniques. These inlcude blending with synthetic or natural polymers, 
crosslinking, and preparing as composites (Kampeerapappun et al. 2007). The 
132 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications innovative materials technology has emerged through the introduction of nano 
starch into PLA. This bio-based nanocomposite with greater mechanical as well 
physical properties has been growing as an attractive alternative over the past 
decade (Xiong et al. 2014). 
Nanotechnology is basically a creation and a subsequent use of structures with at 
least one dimension of less than 100 nm. It exhibits several innovative properties 
and phenomena that could not otherwise be shown by conventional isolated mo￾lecules or aggregates (Lagaron and Lopez-Rubio 2011). With the synthetic plastic 
materials, starch or other bio-based products are used to serve numerous important 
functions in different applications. However, their usual properties are not so at￾tractive. In contrast, the use of nanotechnology for bio-based polymers has in￾troduced many significant opportunities to reduce their shortcomings (Soykeabkaew 
et al. 2015). 
Here, employing nanoscale fillers plays a significant role in the growth of polymer 
nanocomposites, which represent a radical substitute to the conventional polymeric 
materials. The nanocomposites also offer several additional advantages, such as ex￾cellent surface properties, good flow, low density, transparency, and recycling. It is 
worthy to noting that all of these improvements can be achieved from very small 
amount of complementary content (generally, less than 5%) (Sorrentino et al. 2007). 
5.2 FILM-FORMING METHODS 
Biopolymers such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and resins are the main 
materials that make up the film, used alone or in combination (Han and Aristippo 
2005). Starch is one kind of polysaccharide that is used to produce biodegradable 
films at a minimal cost; it is able to form a continuous matrix and low oxygen 
permeability compared to other non-biodegradable films (Jimenez et al. 2012). One 
of the most attractive properties of starch is its potential to create integrated films, 
which are processed at specific conditions. The starch generally does not dissolve in 
normal water and also does not melt like conventional thermoplastics owing to its 
unique degradation properties. When starch is processed to cut forces through a 
plasticizer, its particles lose their semicrystalinity and convert into ultrastructure in 
an irreversible style-continuous matrix (Biliaderis 2009). The resources for bio￾polymer film-formation are normally used to gelatinize to manufacture the film￾forming solutions. Converting the native starch into films is generally followed after 
gelatinization and solution casting (wet process) or melting process (dry process) 
(Pelissari et al. 2019). A classification of film forming methods is shown in 
Figure 5.7. 
5.2.1 SOLUTION CASTING (WET PROCESS) 
Solution casting system is done based on the Stokes’ principle. In this method, the 
polymer and prepolymer are formed bonds equally and soluble in the appropriate 
solution. The polymer matrix is a gaseous phase and easily soluble in a suitable 
solution. The nanoparticles are dispersed in one or more solutions. Finally, both 
were found mixed (Das et al. 2018). The solution-casting technique is an old 
Modified Hydrophobic Nano Starch 133 method used to produce starch film forming. This method has widely been used to 
produce starch films for different applications (Pelissari et al. 2019). Gelatinization 
is activated only by the inflammation effect of water-separating amylose and 
amylopectin chains, dissolving them completely. The starch solution made of 
gelatin is placed on the right surface and left to dry until a film is formed. 
The thickness of the film is then determined by adjusting the volume of the starch 
solution (Versino et al. 2016). 
Surface area ratio at dry atmosphere is determined by the RH, drying time, 
and temperature, and consequently, the microstructure of the starch film (Versino 
et al. 2016). 
Generally, the solution casting is performed on a bench where very low levels of 
starch are produced. This is a time-consuming process, and water is used as the only 
cost-effective solvent for starch. Solution casting for producing starch is not a large￾scale technique for manufacturing the film. It has one advantage over all the other 
starch-processing methods. The starch films made by the solution-casting method 
always show an excellent appealing quality, which is a most desired aspect for a 
food-packaging material. 
5.2.2 MELT PROCESSING (DRY PROCESS) 
In the melt-mixing technique, the nanoparticles are mixed with each other at molten 
state (Das et al. 2018). The starch films can also be produced by a dry method. Here, 
the native starches do not act as thermoplastic polymers. However, due to the shear 
pressure, temperature in the range of 120°C–200°C, and water and/or plasticizers, it 
turns into a molten continuous matrix of starches for glycerol, urea, sorbitol, and 
formamide. Here, the original semi-crystalline structure is collapsed (Janssen and 
Leszek 2009). This process is quite different from the gelatinization event. The 
amount of water present in this dry process is limited (i.e., 12%). As a result, the 
clusters of amylopectin soften and decline, mainly because of the combined 
effects of temperature and cutting forces supported by the plasticizer (Fitch-Vargas 
et al. 2016). 
FIGURE 5.7 Classification of film-forming methods. 
134 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications The plasticizers are mainly used in the preparation of TPS, including low￾molecular-mass polyols, concentrated by glycerol (>20%), the acetamide, 
amine compounds formamide, and urea. The polyols promote a good starch granule 
breakdown and increase the flexibility of TPS films. However, they also accelerate 
the regression of amylose and amylopectin, and it makes the TPS more brittle 
over time (Pushpadass et al. 2009). 
5.2.3 NANOTECHNOLOGY IN STARCH FOOD PACKAGING 
Native starch exhibits some limitations to its hydrophilicity. Like any biopolymer, 
the mechanical properties of the conventional starch plastics are poor and also 
brittle (Alcázar et al. 2015). In contrast, nanotechnology especially advances the 
green nanotechnology (GN), which is trying to solve the aforementioned problems 
and significantly improving the properties of starch-based films. In the last two 
decades, another versatile research area that has emerged is polymer nano￾technology using polymer nanocomposites for food-packaging applications. The 
nanocomposites containing the scattered nano-structured phase represent a new 
class of materials named nano packaging. 
The nanotechnology packaging system classified three categories (González 
et al. 2017). 
1. Particulated 3D nano reinforcements 
2. Fibrillated 2D nano reinforcements 
3. Laminated 1D nano reinforcements 
In the original form of nanomaterials with biopolymeric matrix, food with advanced 
features creates nano-packaging systems. The nano-packaging system includes the 
strength, stiffness, flexibility, heat resistance, thermal stability, moisture stability, 
gaseous, light, and water-barrier protection, biological functions, antioxidant, an￾timicrobial, and antioxidant properties. Thus, it provides safety and security of 
content, and minimizes any important interactions with food metrics and human 
health (González et al. 2017). 
The team of researchers combined ZnO nanoparticles into different bio 
polymeric films. The bio polymeric films are generally made from carboxymethyl 
cellulose, carrageenan, and agar. The researchers found that the nanoparticles 
were uniformly dispersed in the matrix, and the colors of the films were changed 
by the various sizes of ZnO nanoparticles. The proper combination of ZnO na￾noparticles in the films led to a rise in ultra violet (UV) barrier, band gap (Eb) 
value, hydrophobicity, humidity, and thermal stability of the films, while vapor 
barrier and TS were low (Kanmani and Rhim 2014). The attainment of green 
metal nanoparticles (MNPs) showed a new era in nanotechnology. Plant extracts 
are a very good choice for the “green” synthesis of metal nanoparticles since the 
plant juices contain many such biological compounds (e.g., amino acids, proteins, 
terpenoids, polysaccharides, enzymes, organic acids, flavonoids, polyphenols, 
tannins, and etc.) that can control and stabilize the nanoparticles biologically (Ali 
et al. 2020). 
Modified Hydrophobic Nano Starch 135 In recent years, the ecofriendly products have received widespread attention as 
safe and nontoxic food packaging materials. However, further enhancement is also 
required to develop optimal compositions for suitable biomaterials that comply with 
tuning on the migration of nanomaterials from packaging to food applications 
(Mironescu et al. 2021). 
5.3 ROLE OF HYDROPHOBIC STARCH PACKAGING AND 
CONTAINERS 
The packaging containers accommodate the largest arena (29.5%) of plastic wastes 
in municipality solid waste (MSW), as shown in Figure 5.8 (EPA 2010). Recently, 
from retail stores to internet shopping, packaging plays a crucial role in securing 
goods during transportation and in displaying products. Here, consumer appeal also 
can be changed in package design, which can significantly alter the product sales 
(Lee et al. 2010). Continuous efforts on reducing the packaging and its environ￾mental effect should be a priority. It is also worth acknowledging the packaging that 
plays an important role in society. Perhaps no other packaging division other than 
the food industry can explain this better. Food packaging is one of the biggest 
industries in the world among the packaging industries (Pearson 2008). The energy 
and resources are used to transport the wasted food, cultivation, harvesting, and 
marketing, and require extra energy to transport to lands. In methane (CH4) pro￾duction, food waste significantly contributes to greenhouse gas production and 
environmental implications (Mena et al. 2011). 
5.3.1 CONSUMER AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS 
Numerous plastic products coming to the market are finally searching their route to 
the municipal solid waste (MSW) facility. The U.S. Environmental Protection 
FIGURE 5.8 Total MSW generation by category. 
136 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications Agency (EPA) keeps the MSW data on the products that are recycled or disposed as 
MSW for decades. The plastic waste started to appear in MSW in the 1970s, 
gradually growing to a total of about 30 MMT (metric million ton). Disposal of 
plastic waste in American landscapes is a concern, in part, due to the sheer size and 
declining land area near urban centres. In this regard, plastic discards can be 
classified by the EPA as nondurable materials, durable materials, packaging, and 
containers (EPA 2010). 
5.3.2 INCREASING SHELF LIFE OF GOODS 
Packaging is a crucial step for improving food. The synthetic plastics with adequate 
transparency, flexibility, and low weight have been widely used for food-packaging 
applications. In addition, they are attributed to severe environmental hazards owing 
to their nonbiodegradable properties. In this context, the addition of natural bio￾logical compounds extracted from different natural sources, such as herbs and 
plants, to the fresh and processed products is an alternative technique commonly 
used to improve the shelf life of food products (Hosseini et al. 2019). To prevent the 
growth of undesirable microorganisms, antibiotics can be added directly to the food 
product during formation, used as a coating or attached to its surface (Del Nobile 
et al. 2012). Further, adding these compounds directly may meant more size, which 
can change the taste of food (Uz and Altınkaya 2011). 
Contamination may happen during handling or exposure of the product 
throughout or after the manufacturing process. As a result, the growth of micro￾organisms in the foods begins, or becomes highly intense, on the surface of pro￾ducts. Hence, the use of antibiotics may be more efficient than adding pictures or 
coatings. The antimicrobial agents grow directly into the food. They may be se￾lected from the package and moved step by step. The food-surface thereby ensures 
that the higher concentrations of antimicrobial agents can be maintained whenever 
needed (Ouattara et al. 2000). 
Essential oils (EOs) are typically volatile. Fragrant substances with oil con￾sistency are usually extracted from plants. These products are important ingredients 
for biodegradable food packaging. It is mainly owing to their natural appearance 
and their functional behaviour (antioxidant or antimicrobial) to enhance the pro￾duct’s shelf life and value (Atarés and Chiralt 2016). The lytic enzyme lysozyme 
(LZ) is the most widely used antimicrobial enzymes for adhering to packaging 
materials (Moreno et al. 2015). Due to its ability to inhibit the growth of many 
pathogenic bacteria and fungi, this active agent is frequently used in polysaccharide 
antimicrobial films or coatings derived from the disintegration of chitin (Cagri et al. 
2004). 
Today, many types of biodegradable starch packaging (e.g., mater-Bi and 
BIOPAR) are already commercialized. The mater-Bi product is a kind of corn 
starch-based bioplastic, launched by Novamont in Italy. It is used as thermoform 
trays for eating food, wrapping paper, packaging pulses, extruded tube mesh, 
avocado wrappers, cardboard plates, and bags for food. The BIOPAR is another 
commercialized plastic product based on potato starch. 
Modified Hydrophobic Nano Starch 137 5.3.3 CHALLENGES 
Bio-plastics are generally promoted as an alternative to standard plastics. However, 
bioplastic production becomes a more challenging point since production should 
not be disrupted for the lack of food resources. Utilization of non-food resources for 
this application can relieve this situation, named as second-generation bio-plastics. 
However, these second-generation bio-plastics must be manufactured using three 
processing methods: discharge, compression, and injection design. The potential 
environmental problems and effects of bio-plastics have not yet been completely 
explored or understood. Therefore, more research is needed to overcome the limited 
resources available, enhance the resource efficiency, and minimize the environ￾mental issues (Sidek et al. 2019). 
Some bio-plastics derived from bacterial polymer (such as PLA) are biode￾gradable. They work only under certain conditions of temperature and humidity 
since the properties of these materials degrade only at that particular stage (Zulkafli 
2014). Bioplastic production is significantly increased compared to conventional 
plastics, which have a positive impact on the bioplastic’s environment, reducing the 
greenhouse gas emissions, space for waste storage, and the risk to marine pollution 
and human health (Comaniţă et al. 2015). 
Bioplastic development is a key to the reliability obtained by novel nano￾technology and the legitimacy of industries that create market and promote sus￾tainable technology (Thakur et al. 2018). 
5.4 APPLICATIONS OF GREEN PACKAGING NANOMATERIAL 
PLA is a well-known 100% biobased plastic best among the plastics currently being 
used in packaging applications. The PLA is very suitable for manufacturing the 
compostable packaging products (Gadhave et al. 2018). When bioplastics are mixed 
with other pharmaceutical reagents, the materials exhibit very good compression 
properties, thereby forming a dense matrix suitable for oral administration of the 
drug-loaded tablets. The crystal nanocellulose is an advanced pelletization system 
that can control the rate of decomposition of tablet and release of drug by adding 
coating or particulate matter to the tablet (Jackson et al. 2011). 
In the dental industry, the bioplastic-based nanocellulose is used in the renewal 
of dental tissues in humans; it is produced from microbial cellulose by the gluca￾nacetobacter xylinus strain (An et al. 2017). The bioplastics also excel in interesting 
searches, such as construction and the building industry. Furthermore, the builders 
as well as the house owners are also attracted to bioplastics for various products, 
such as fencing, flooring, and so on (Souza et al. 2012). 
The growth of bioplastics in the packaging industry is slowing down in the 
grocery store delis or food service industry for sandwich wrappers, film, clamshell 
packaging, or packaging of new products, such as vegetables, salads, fruits, pasta or 
bakery products (Pilla 2011). 
Nanoparticles are an important topic in distribution of anti-cancer drugs. The 
delivery of nanoparticles composed of biodegradable materials, such as PLA, 
proteins, and polysaccharides, has been established. The polysaccharide systems are 
138 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications also of great importance in many studies owing to their low toxicity, high volume, 
and high biocompatibility. However, relatively few starch-dependent nanoparticles 
supply structures have been reported (Lombardo et al. 2019). In this context, 
therapeutic nanoparticles have been used as a powerful technology for the con￾tinuation of cell, tissue, or disease-specific release (Palanisamy et al. 2020). The 
commonly used application of starch nanomaterial is to incorporate film in to 
packaging films as reinforcement or filler components of the matrix film (Razavi 
et al. 2016). The scanning electron microscopies of nano starch extracted from 
different plant sources are shown in Figure 5.9 (Sujka and Jamroz 2013). 
Morphological characteristics of starch nanoparticles on the hydrolysis compo￾sition using hydrolysate and short-chain glucans are depicted in Figure 5.10 
(Oh et al. 2020). 
The chemical structure of starch has been explored for the past few decades, but 
still, there is a lack of universal acceptance owing to its structural complexity (Kim 
et al. 2012). However, a predominant model for nano starch is treated as a con￾centric semicrystalline multiscale-structure. It typically allows the production of 
new nano materials. The starch nanocrystals resulting from the disruption of 
FIGURE 5.9 Scanning electron microscopic images of the starch extracted from different 
plant sources (a) corn, (b) rice, (c) wheat and (d) potato; adapted from Ref. ( Sujka and 
Jamroz 2013) with permission. 
Modified Hydrophobic Nano Starch 139 amorphous part from semicrystalline granules can be produced by acid hydrolysis 
method. The starch nanoparticles can also be produced from gelatinized starch. Kim 
et al. 2012, Razavi et al. 2016, and Sun 2018 had shown transmission electron 
microscopy of starch nanoparticles from different plants (Sun 2018; Kim et al. 
2012; Razavi et al. 2016). Figure 5.11 showed typical transmission electron mi￾crographs of starch nanoparticles (SNPs) produced by primary short linear glucan 
(SLG) at different concentrations 1, 5, and 10%(w/v) and respective particle size 
distributions of SNPs determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Liu et al. 
2017). The starch is mainly a multiscale hierarchical structure. The size of starch 
granules derived from normal maize is around 30 µm. It contains amorphous and 
semicrystalline growth rings of size 120–500 nm, which comprise alternate lamellae 
of amorphous and crystalline of size 9 nm. The semicrystalline growth ring 
blocklets of size 20–50 nm constitutes a unit of the growth rings. The crystalline 
lamellae of the blocklets consist of the amylopectin double helixes, nanocrystals of 
the crystalline lamellae called starch nanocrystals when separated by acid hydro￾lysis, amylopectin’s molecular structure, and amylose molecular structure of size 
0.1–1 nm (Liu et al. 2017). 
5.5 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 
The present chapter discussed the current demands on biodegradable materials 
based on micro and nano-starch-based plastic materials for food packaging and 
FIGURE 5.10 Morphological characteristics of starch nanoparticles on the hydrolysis 
composition using hydrolysate (a–d) and short-chain glucans (e–l); adapted from Ref. ( Oh 
et al. 2020). 
140 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications several applications. The ecological effect of bulk nonbiodegradable waste products 
stimulates research on new biodegradable nanomaterials made from natural re￾sources, such as organisms, plants, and microorganisms. Starch nanomaterial is one 
of the most promising natural polymers for the manufacturing of biodegradable 
packaging, owing to its appeal, combination of obtainability, value, and routine. 
Furthermore, because of its long-term viability, the market for bioplastics is 
expected to grow. Furthermore, microbial biotechnology allows for the production 
of bioplastics since it may be used and commercialized in a variety of industries, 
including agriculture, medicine, pharmaceuticals, and veterinary medicine. With 
increasing customer demand for long-life, safety, and high-quality foods, as well as 
environmental awareness and demand for biodegradable plastics, starch excels at 
reducing the use of petroleum-based packages. Nano starch material is now a better 
alternative. 
Bioplastics must have an integrated eco-friendly basis to maximize the sus￾tainability of materials and processes throughout its lifespan. Bioplastic products 
should reduce the need for non-renewable resources in the long run without com￾peting with traditional sources like starch. Nano starch-based bioplastics would 
potentially be produced with enhanced properties such as strength, hydrophobicity, 
long-term usage. In future, many studies might investigate the topics related to nano 
starch in order to improve its specific characteristics.

6.1 INTRODUCTION 
Active packaging protects food from spoilage by separating food products from the 
environment by providing an inert barrier. Some nanomaterials are directly combined 
into packaging material or embedded into food contact material. In general, active 
substances or nanomaterials are employed in packaging to enhance the internal 
environment of food by absorbing moisture, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other 
compounds (Rai et al. 2019). Bio-nanocomposites are composed of two major 
components called biopolymer or continuous phase and act as a matrix, and the other 
is the dispersed phase, which acts as a reinforcement agent with dimensions ranging 
from 1 to 100 nm. Bio-nanocomposites have specific biocompatibility, flexibility, 
biodegradability, cost-effectiveness, and eco-friendliness, which can be improved 
further by the reinforcement components. The fusion of nanofillers and biodegradable 
polymers can modify bio-nano composites (Sharma, Jafari, and Sharma 2020). 
6.2 ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS IN ACTIVE FOOD PACKAGING 
Mechanisms of some antimicrobial agents are illustrated as shown in Figure 6.1 and 
discussed as follows below 
6.2.1 MOISTURE SCAVENGERS 
Active moisture scavengers are relative humidity (RH) controllers scavenging 
moisture in the headspace, like dryers and moisture removers that absorb liquids. 
Sheets, covers, and beddings are commonly used to protect fresh food in various 
packaging approaches. The most common materials used in such pads are porous 
materials, polymers, puddled and perforated PS papers, or cellulose mixed with 
biopolymer polymers/minerals/salts (polyacrylate salts, chitosan, starch copoly￾mers, zeolite) (Ščetar et al. 2010). 
Renewable Nanocomposites for Food Packaging 153 6.2.2 ETHYLENE ABSORBERS 
Ethylene accumulation can induce green vegetable discoloration and may be the 
source of various post-harvest problems in fresh fruits and vegetables. As a result, 
there are various commercial ways of removing gaseous ethylene. When it comes to 
developing promising technologies, not only are technical aspects important, but so 
are regulatory and marketing issues like the safety of the food, cost, and consumer 
perceptions (Yildirim et al. 2018). 
6.2.3 OXYGEN SCAVENGERS 
Because it is responsible for oxidation and the growth of insects, molds, and 
bacteria, oxygen causes food to deteriorate. The role of oxygen scavengers 
is to lower oxygen concentrations to less than 0.01% and keep them there 
(Byun et al. 2011). 
6.2.4 ESSENTIAL OILS (EOS) 
Since most EOs are generally recognized as safe (GRAS), they have been 
widely investigated as additives in organic emulsion packaging films (Ruiz-Navajas 
et al. 2013). 
FIGURE 6.1 Summary of some antimicrobial agents’ mechanisms in active food packaging. 
154 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 6.2.5 ENZYMES 
The following are some examples of the enzymes that have been actively pursued: 
• Glucose oxidase and catalase are used to eliminate oxygen and remove 
microbiological degradation products. 
• Lactase is added to milk to help eliminate lactose. 
• Cholesterol-changing enzymes are added to liquid egg or milk to eliminate 
cholesterol. 
• Enzymatically triggered time-temperature integrator indicators. 
6.2.6 BACTERIOCINS 
Bacteriocin is used to keep food fresh and clean. The antimicrobial packaging film 
must touch the food’s surface for bacteriocins to diffuse to the surface. Compared 
to immersing and spraying foods with bacteria, the progressive transfer of bacter￾iocins from packing films to the surface of the food may benefit (Appendini and 
Hotchkiss 1996). 
6.2.7 ANTIMICROBIAL POLYMERS 
Packaging materials must prolong the period and reduce the growth of micro￾organisms to increase the shelf life and keep food quality and safety, which can be 
accomplished by introducing antimicrobial agents to the packaging material or 
employing antimicrobial polymers that meet the requirements (Han 2000). 
6.3 CLASSIFICATION OF ANTIMICROBIAL FILMS AND COATINGS 
ACCORDING TO THEIR COMPOSITION 
As shown in Figure 6.2, antimicrobial films and coatings can be classified according 
to their composition as follows: 
6.3.1 POLYSACCHARIDE-BASED FILMS AND COATINGS 
6.3.1.1 Starch 
Starch films are characterized by their excellent gas barrier properties (Cazón et al. 
2017), appropriate durability, cohesive strength, and nontoxicity. The incorporation 
of Ɛ-poly-L-lysine into starch films exhibited an inhibitory effect against E. coli 
and B. subtilis (Zhang et al. 2015). However, a significant limitation in using starch 
coatings is their poor mechanical properties which are dependent on moisture. 
In high humidity, they lose their strength and barrier properties, while in dry 
atmosphere, they become brittle. Plasticizers could overcome this drawback by 
improving flexibility (Souza et al. 2012). 
Renewable Nanocomposites for Food Packaging 155 6.3.1.2 Cellulose 
Due to its renewability, low cost, nontoxicity, low density, high mechanical 
strength, durability, biodegradability, and chemical stability, cellulose could be used 
for making biodegradable films. Cellulose-based films and coatings can retain the 
most water in the product exhibiting an anti-rancidity effect. Methylcellulose could 
be used as a carrier of antibacterial agents in producing edible films (Kocira et al. 
2021). Padrao and his colleagues manufactured bacterial nanocellulose-lactoferrin 
edible films for active food packaging, exhibiting high antimicrobial activity against 
Staphylococcus aureus (Padrao et al. 2016). 
6.3.1.3 Chitin/Chitosan 
Chitosan films and coatings are selectively permeable to CO2 and O2 and biode￾gradable, with good mechanical properties. Therefore, edible chitosan films and 
coatings are used to protect vegetables and fruit against spoilage and microbial 
contamination by regulating gas permeability (Al-Tayyar, Youssef, and Al-Hindi 
2020). However, some factors, including high water vapor permeability and low 
water solubility, resulting from its rigid crystal structure, make chitosan difficult to 
directly use (Chaudhary et al. 2020). 
FIGURE 6.2 Classification of antimicrobial films and coatings according to their compo￾sition: polysaccharide-based films and coatings, protein-based films and coatings and lipid￾based films and coatings. 
156 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 6.3.1.4 Alginates 
Alginate films have strong fibrous structures in solid-state, are impermeable to fats 
and oils, and provide an excellent barrier to oxygen, delaying lipid oxidation in 
vegetables and fruits and reducing their weight loss, as well as the abundance of 
microflora on the surface (Kocira et al. 2021). Furthermore, they help delay the 
ripening process of fruits and vegetables during storage (Al-Tayyar, Youssef, and 
Al-Hindi 2020). Alginate coatings inhibit microbial growth and prevent dehydration 
in fresh-cut fruits (Ferreira, Alves, and Coelhoso 2016). 
6.3.1.5 Carrageenan 
Carrageenan is a natural hydrophilic polymer obtained from species of marine 
algae belonging mainly to rhodophyceae. Kappa carrageenan (κ-carrageenan) 
is a form of carrageenan commonly used in food due to its excellent ability 
to form gels and membranes and its good mechanical properties (Ferreira, 
Alves, and Coelhoso 2016). Carrageenan is used mainly in dairy products, 
nutritional supplement beverages, infant formulas, pet food, and dietetic for￾mulas (Necas and Bartosikova 2013). It also makes edible films and coatings 
that protect vegetables and fruit against moisture loss, turgor loss, chemical 
oxidation, and aging processes. Moreover, carrageenan films and coatings re￾duce the number of microorganisms in food when combined with ascorbic acid 
(Lin and Zhao 2007). 
6.3.2 PROTEIN-BASED FILMS AND COATINGS 
6.3.2.1 Milk Proteins 
Milk proteins have attracted attention as a biomaterial for the preparation of films 
due to their ability to form elastic, transparent, and tasteless films. Casein, one of the 
milk proteins, is a desirable biomaterial to make edible films due to its nontoxicity, 
biodegradability, availability, stability at different conditions, emulsification cap￾ability, micelle formation capability, water solubility, and high nutritional value. 
Casein films have a good oxygen barrier that prevents food oxidation. They can also 
carry food additives, including colors, antioxidants, or antibacterial compounds. 
Whey, another milk protein, is characterized by its good film-forming properties 
enabling the production of films and coating materials with a relatively low gas 
permeability used for oxygen-sensitive food products (Mihalca et al. 2021). 
Furthermore, the addition of low concentrations of a water-soluble chitosan deri￾vative to whey protein enables the manufacture of protein films characterized by 
their excellent fungistatic and barrier properties against food spoilage fungi, espe￾cially aspergillus niger (Braber et al. 2021). Badr and his colleagues found that 
adding 2.5% w/w cumin, cinnamon, and thyme essential oil to edible films of whey 
protein can extend the shelf life of fresh beef meat when refrigerated (Badr, Ahmed 
and El Gamal 2014). 
Renewable Nanocomposites for Food Packaging 157 6.3.2.2 Soy Proteins Isolates (SPI) 
Soy protein films are characterized by their excellent film-forming properties 
and many other effective properties, such as dough, emulsification, cohesiveness, 
adhesiveness, fiber formation, water and fat absorption, and texturizing capability. 
The characteristics of soy protein films can be affected by certain chemicals. 
For example, mango kernel extracts are added to soy protein isolate films (SPI) to 
increase their antioxidant activity, thickness, tensile strength, and transparency 
(Mihalca et al. 2021). Moreover, incorporating food-grade antimicrobial com￾pounds, like lysozyme, nisin, and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), into 
SPI films can inhibit microbial growth. Lysozyme or nisin incorporated SPI films 
inhibit L. plantarum. EDTA increases the inhibitory effect of films against E. coli 
(Cha and Chinnan 2004). 
6.3.2.3 Wheat Protein 
Gluten proteins and wheat proteins are mainly divided into gliadin and glutenin 
(Wieser et al. 2007). Gluten-based films are characterized by their excellent 
film-forming properties due to their cohesiveness and elasticity. They are also 
characterized by a shiny surface, adequate oxygen-isolation performance, poor 
water-vapor resistance, and poor mechanical properties (Chen et al. 2019). Many 
studies have been done to improve gluten film’s properties. The addition of thyme 
essential oil to gluten-edible films boosts their antioxidant and antimicrobial 
properties. Thyme oil could protect the wheat-gluten matrix against oxidative 
destruction during processing and exhibit significant antimicrobial activity 
against gram-positive bacteria (L. innocua and S. aureus), gram-negative bacteria 
(E. coli and P. aeruginosa) and native microflora of some vegetables (Ansorena, 
Zubeldía, and Marcovich 2016). 
6.3.2.4 Collagen/Gelatin 
Collagen is usually combined with other biopolymers to enhance its effectiveness 
in food packaging (Mihalca et al. 2021). An example is an agar–alginate–collagen 
film with incorporated silver nanoparticles (A/A/CAgNPs), exhibiting excellent an￾timicrobial properties against Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes, in ad￾dition to its good mechanical and water resistance; A/A/CAgNPs films exhibited 
an increase in mechanical strength (Wang and Rhim 2015). Another animal protein 
obtained from partial hydrolysis of collagen is gelatin. Gelatin has become an 
important raw material for preparing biodegradable films due to its good film￾forming properties, biocompatibility, biodegradability, abundance, and low cost. 
Gelatin has a melting point near the human body, making it an essential raw ma￾terial for producing edible films (Chen et al. 2019). Edible films of gelatin have 
relatively low oxygen permeability, and by adding some agents like citrus essential 
oils or thymol, gelatin films may acquire antioxidant and antimicrobial effects, 
especially against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia 
coli, and Bacillus subtilis (Kavoosi, Dadfar, and Purfard 2013). Hosseini and his 
colleagues successfully manufactured bio-nano composite films for food packaging 
made from fish gelatin and chitosan NPs to extend the shelf life of food products 
158 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications (Sharma, Jafari, and Sharma 2020). The addition of mango kernel extracts, as in SPI 
films, increases the antioxidant activity, thickness, tensile strength, and transparency 
of fish gelatin films (Mihalca et al. 2021). 
6.3.3 LIPID-BASED FILMS AND COATINGS 
6.3.3.1 Waxes 
Waxes are employed as food coatings and films due to their low water solubility 
and good barrier properties to gas and water vapor (Motelica et al. 2020). 
The antimicrobial activity of Abeego food wrap (a beeswax-based product) has 
been reported since it has an intense antibacterial activity against some bacteria, 
e.g., Salmonella enteritidis and Staphyloccocus aureus (Pinto, Pankowski, and 
Nano 2021). 
6.3.3.2 Glycerides 
Glycerides are added to the hydrocolloid matrix to improve water-vapor 
barrier properties (Kocira et al. 2021). Monoglycerides are employed as emul￾sifiers in edible films to stabilize emulsified films and increase adhesion between 
two components with different hydrophobicity (Cha and Chinnan 2004). 
Monoglycerides are also used as plasticizers to modify the barrier properties of 
films and increase their water-vapor permeability (Cazón et al. 2017). Acetylated 
monoglycerides are commonly utilized in edible coatings (Cha and Chinnan 
2004). Triglycerides, natural plasticizers from vegetable oils, are widely used 
because they have low toxicity and low migration (Vieira et al. 2011). 
Triglycerides are insoluble in bulk water; instead, they form a stable monolayer 
at the interface (Cha and Chinnan 2004). 
6.4 RENEWABLE NANOCOMPOSITES IN FOOD ENCAPSULATION 
6.4.1 COMPARISON BETWEEN MICROENCAPSULATION AND NANOENCAPSULATION 
Table 6.1 illustrates the significant differences between microencapsulation and 
nanoencapsulation. 
The microencapsulation procedure was presented many years ago (Suganya 
and Anuradha 2017). Microencapsulation involves the entrapment of the active 
ingredient either in solid, liquid, or even gaseous state into encapsulating agent 
through mechanical (physical) methods or physicochemical methods (Frakolaki 
et al. 2020). Once the active ingredients are entrapped in the encapsulating agent, 
they become embedded in the coating layer or integrated with either a hetero￾geneous or homogeneous matrix to form the microcapsule (Estevinho and Rocha 
2017). Different coating materials are employed, depending on their rheological 
characteristics, their capacity to distribute and stabilize the active ingredient, their 
inertness towards the active molecule, and their ability to retain the active com￾pound correctly. Certain drawbacks are associated with the encapsulation technique 
employed, as shown in Table 6.2. 
Renewable Nanocomposites for Food Packaging 159 TABLE 6.1 
Comparison between Microencapsulation and Nanoencapsulation 
Encapsulation Type Microencapsulation Nanoencapsulation 
Capsule Size 1 to 1000 µm ( Suganya and Anuradha 
2017) 
10 to 1000 nm ( Konan, Gurny, and 
Allémann 2002). 
Coating Materials For example, carbohydrates like starch 
and modified starch as maltodextrin 
and cyclodextrin are common coating 
materials. Lipids such as wax, 
beeswax, and diacylglycerols are also 
common coating materials 
( Choudhury, Meghwal, and Das 2021). 
The most frequent natural polymers 
in the nanoencapsulation process 
are gelatin, sodium alginate, 
albumin, and chitosan ( Suganya 
and Anuradha 2017). 
Advantages Facile handling, masking of odors, 
tastes, colors, side interactions 
prevention (Laokuldilok et al. 2016; 
Arenas-Jal, Suñé-Negre, and García￾Montoya 2020). 
Nanocapsules have a large surface 
area, tiny particle size, and they 
are easy to form stable and uniform 
colloidal systems. Due to their small 
particle size, nanocapsules have 
better bioavailability for nutrients in 
functional food, improved controlled 
release, and precise targeting for 
the encapsulated core material 
( Ye, Georges, and Selomulya 2018; 
Yang et al. 2020) 
Drawbacks Certain drawbacks are associated with 
the encapsulation technique ( Krajišnik, 
Calija, and Cekić 2017). 
Compared to regular, particle-sized 
microcapsules, nanocapsules have a 
higher particle size requirement; 
therefore, nanocapsules require 
additional, usually high energy 
treatments based on the preparation 
of common capsules, such as high￾pressure, ultrasound, intense 
mechanical agitation, or otherwise 
( Yang et al. 2020). Some challenges 
stand before nanotechnology 
applications in the probiotics industry 
because bacteria are mostly on a 
microscale, making it difficult to 
maintain their viability when applying 
nanotechnology (Frakolaki et al. 
2020). There are safety concerns 
before nanoencapsulation application, 
as there is not enough available data 
for the toxicity due to the recent 
nanoencapsulation discovery ( Jafari, 
Katouzian, and Akhavan 2017a). 
160 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications On the other hand, nanoencapsulation is a type of encapsulation in which the 
active ingredients are encapsulated in a very tiny system at the nanoscale. 
Nanoemulsions are commonly employed in nanoencapsulation, especially in lipo￾some formation. Nanoemulsions participated in the encapsulation of several

the tiny size of the droplet (Dhakal and He 2020). Nanocapsule has become an 
attractive direction in the field of study in encapsulation (Yang et al. 2020). 
6.4.2 MECHANISMS OF RELEASE IN FOOD ENCAPSULATION 
6.4.2.1 Diffusion 
Diffusion is the random transport of bioactive molecules across semipermeable 
membranes according to the concentration gradient. The diffusion mechanism is 
the most frequently occurring release mechanism in controlled-release systems. 
Bioactive molecules diffusion depends on the polarity, solubility, permeability, 
shape, and size of the transported molecules. Also, it is affected by the inter￾molecular interactions such as van der Waals’ and hydrogen bond interactions 
across the chains and the crystallinity of the polymers (carriers) (Boostani and 
Mahdi 2021). 
6.4.2.2 Osmosis 
The osmosis release mechanism occurs when a non-swelling encapsulation system 
absorbs water from the surrounding environment. The absorption of water induces 
the release of the bioactive molecules due to the osmotic pressure generation. Both 
osmosis and swelling release mechanisms are similar in absorbing, swelling, and 
rapturing the carrier when placed in a proper solvent (Boostani and Jafari 2020; 
Boostani and Mahdi 2021). 
6.4.2.3 Erosion 
There are two types of erosion mechanisms. The first is surface erosion, where 
degradation occurs exclusively on the carrier’s exterior surface. The second is 
bulk erosion, in which the whole carrier is degraded. The erosion mechanism may 
be described as the release event without transport events due to the carrier 
dissolution (McClements 2014). To begin eroding the polymer, it must first 
diffuse its degradation products into the release environment (Jafari et al. 2017b; 
Katouzian et al. 2017). 
6.4.2.4 Release by Swelling 
In this mechanism, the core materials are released due to swelling agents in the core 
materials. The presence of specific ingredient components in the encapsulation 
system may affect its swelling, as those ingredients may act as osmolytes and 
trigger diffusion of the solvent into the encapsulation system (Boostani and Jafari 
2020; Boostani and Mahdi 2021). 
6.4.2.5 Release by Fragmentation 
Fragmentation occurs when the carrier cracks or breaks due to various factors, 
including pressure, pH changes, shearing events, and enzymatic activity, releasing 
the food components (Boostani and Jafari 2020). 
162 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 6.4.2.6 Degradation 
It is possible to release microcapsules core materials through biodegradation 
processes if the coatings are compatible with such degradative mechanisms. 
Degradation by biological systems or microorganisms is a process that involves the 
chain-scission or disintegration of biomaterials (Boostani and Jafari 2020; Boostani 
and Mahdi 2021). 
6.4.2.7 Dissolution Mechanism 
In this mechanism, the active ingredient is released through the melting of the 
capsule. The dissolution can be done by placing the capsule in a proper solvent or 
by thermal meaning. The melting can be applied in the food industry by choosing 
encapsulating materials such as lipids, modified lipids, or waxes approved for food 
usage (Madene and Jacquot 2006). 
6.5 ANTIMICROBIAL BIO-NANOCOMPOSITES FOR FOOD 
PACKAGING 
As a result of their biodegradability, availability, comparable cost, and ability to 
lessen the use of fossil fuels on a large scale, biopolymers have gotten much at￾tention for replacement of synthetic plastic (Ingrao, Gigli, and Siracusa 2017). 
Biopolymers, often known as biodegradable plastics, are polymeric materials that 
degrade in part through the metabolism of naturally existing organisms (Sorrentino 
et al. 2007). Biodegradation causes the polymers to break or disintegrate under 
the right conditions of moisture, temperature, and oxygen availability, leaving no 
hazardous or environmentally detrimental residues behind (Chandra et al. 1998). 
6.5.1 CLASSIFICATION OF BIOPOLYMERS ACCORDING TO THE SOURCE OF 
PRODUCTION 
6.5.1.1 Biopolymers Extracted from Biomass 
Polymers from biomass are a significant concern and provide the foundation for 
various applications. Throughout the life cycles of organisms, these polymers are 
produced as a by-product. Their significance in many applications (biofuels, na￾nocomposites, biomedical, and so on) has been studied for many years and is 
currently being investigated. Lignin, cellulose, starch, chitin, pectin, and xylan are 
biopolymers or renewable polymers abundant in nature as plant biomass or other 
biological sources. Poor processability, characteristics (thermal stability, mechan￾ical properties, barrier properties, and water absorption), and performance com￾pared to synthetic counterparts appear to be significant challenges in translating 
these biopolymers into actual applications (Adsul et al. 2016). 
6.5.1.2 Biopolymers Synthesized from Biomass Derived Monomers 
According to a life cycle assessment, biomass-derived compounds have a lower 
carbon footprint than their fossil-fuel-derived counterparts. As a result, items de￾rived from sustainable sources appeal to policymakers and customers who care 
Renewable Nanocomposites for Food Packaging 163 about the environment (Krishna et al. 2018). Furthermore, the intrinsic activity of 
biomass or biomass-derived compounds holds considerable promise for creating 
new types of monomers with numerous acid or alcohol groups, resulting in mate￾rials with novel characteristics. Furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural are essential 
biomass-derived platform chemicals that can create various monomers via hetero￾geneous catalysis because of their diverse functional groups and ease of manu￾facture from cellulose/hemicellulose (Yang et al. 2021). As a result, the focus has 
shifted recently from biomass-based gasoline and fuel additives to biomass-based 
high-value chemicals and polymers (Cherubini et al. 2010). 
6.5.1.3 Biopolymers from Microorganisms 
Biopolymers are polymers produced by living cells (Greenwood 2021). Bacteria 
can make a variety of biopolymers, including polysaccharides (which are made up 
of sugar acids and/or sugar linked by glycosidic linkages), polyamides (which are 
made up of amino acids linked by peptide bonds), polyesters (which are made up of 
hydroxy fatty acids linked by ester bonds), and polyphosphates (which are made up 
of inorganic phosphates linked by anhydride bonds) (Moradali et al. 2020). 
Biopolymers are produced spontaneously by bacteria to aid in propagation and are 
essential for energy storage, structural formation, and biofilm formation. With 
genome sequencing and contemporary molecular technologies developing modified 
bacteria that make custom biomolecules, microorganisms’ ability to generate un￾ique biopolymers has enabled many medical and technical uses. Polyphosphates are 
utilized to store energy in bacteria and are negatively charged due to their multiple 
energy-rich anhydride linkages. This also ensures that they interact strongly with 
positively charged polymers or ions, allowing them to be included in hydrogels to 
fine-tune the gel’s physicochemical properties. Polyesters are made by various 
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, albeit their natural role is less well un￾derstood than other biopolymers. Bacteria also generate biopolymers made of 
amino acids, which can be used for biofilm formation, signaling, or storage. 
Polysaccharides are made by a wide range of bacteria and are either stored within 
the cells (as an example, glycogen) or secreted as capsular polysaccharides that 
are connected to the cell surface or are exopolysaccharides that contribute to the 
biofilm matrix as free exopolysaccharides (for example, cellulose and alginate) 
(Moradali et al. 2020). Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are bioplastics made from 
microorganisms that have gained popularity as a substitute for plastics made from 
petroleum because of their related characteristics and the fact that they are biode￾gradable, biocompatible, and are made from waste and renewable resources 
(Laycock et al. 2013). Biopolymer production is mediated by a bacterium’s reg￾ulatory networks and environmental cues (Greenwood 2021). 
6.6 BIOTECHNOLOGY IN BIOPOLYMERS DEVELOPMENTS 
6.6.1 BIOTECHNOLOGICAL MANUFACTURING OF ADIPIC ACID FROM LIGNIN 
There is an excellent case study for exhibiting the potential contribution of green 
chemistry and biopolymers to industrial biotechnology: the synthesis of hexanedioic 
164 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications acid (adipic acid) from lignin and subsequent transformation of hexanedioic acid 
into nylon-6,6. (Pleissner and Kümmerer 2018). Lignin is a component of lig￾nocellulosic biomass. Even though hemicellulose and cellulose from lignocellulosic 
biomass have been significantly studied as carbon sources in various fermentations, 
the effective use of lignin is still in its early stages (Sonoda et al. 2001). Unspecific 
oxidative enzymes produced by fungi and bacteria, such as peroxidases, can break 
down chemical bonds between monomers, releasing various phenolic compounds. 
On the other hand, enzymatic degradation is slower than thermal and chemical 
degradations due to the obstinate nature of lignin (Pleissner and Kümmerer 2018). 
Studies on lignin-derived aromatic compounds in biotechnological processes have 
been conducted despite lignin degradation and product purification difficulties. 
Several bacteria can oxidize aromatic compounds to produce catechol as the es￾sential aromatic intermediate (Harwood and Parales 1996). One example demon￾strates the utilization of aromatic compounds in the production of muconic acid 
((2E,4E)-Hexa-2,4-dienedioic acid) by fermentation. Muconic acid can be trans￾formed by a chemical method to hexanedioic acid (adipic acid), an ancestor to 
nylon-6,6 (van Duuren et al. 2011). An engineered strain (engineered Pseudomonas 
putida KT2440-JD1) was used to investigate a pH-stat fed-batch method to man￾ufacture cis, cis-muconic acid from benzoic acid. The strain converts benzoic acid 
to cis, cis-muconic acid, catechol, and benzoate diol. Other P. putida strains were 
used by Johnson et al. to produce muconic acid from sugars or aromatic compounds 
(Johnson et al. 2016). Biotechnological processes alone can only produce a portion 
of the final product. Muconic acid must be transformed into hexanedioic acid to 
produce nylon-6,6. Under mild operating conditions, catalyzed hydrogenation of 
muconic acid was done. Purification of muconic acid and downstream processing is 
recommended before catalytic transformation (Capelli et al. 2017). 
6.6.2 BACTERIAL CELLULOSE (BC) 
Bacterial cellulose is a cellulose nanoparticle that differs from fiber-like cellulose 
nanofiber (CNF) and needle-shaped cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) (also called bio￾cellulose or microbial nanocellulose). Bacterial cellulose (BC) comprises a network 
of hydrogen bonds that connects ribbon-shaped nanofibers. It is made up of a 
variety of bacterial species and microorganisms (e.g., Pseudomonas, Acetobacter 
xylinum) (Tayeb et al. 2018). Unlike other nano celluloses, BC is produced from 
low-molecular-weight sugars such as d-glucose via a bio-fabrication assembly 
process and isolated as an exopolysaccharide at the air-nutrient media interface 
(Huang et al. 2013). Understanding its biosynthetic process is critical for fine￾tuning culturing conditions and altering the required nanofibril structure and crys￾tallinity, resulting in new features, functions, and applications for bacterial-derived 
nanocellulose (Tayeb et al. 2018). Furthermore, the non-toxic, lightweight, and 
biodegradable bacterial cellulose is manufactured as pure cellulose, avoiding 
hemicellulose or lignin removal by conventional chemical treatments (Tayeb et al. 
2018). Many studies have indicated applications of bacterial cellulose, and it can be 
used as a strengthening agent, transparent film, and binder in hybrid nanocompo￾sites (Juntaro et al. 2007). 
Renewable Nanocomposites for Food Packaging 165 6.6.3 PRODUCTION OF PROTEIN-BASED POLYMERS 
The development of protein-based polymers is merging between materials science 
and genetic engineering. These are proteins with physical properties that allow them 
to be used as functional materials. They typically have repetitive amino acid 
sequences. Natural examples include elastin, collagen and silk, and artificial se￾quences developed. Recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology can 
create these proteins in a suitable host. Conventionally, the main machine for 
manufacturing these polymers has been Escherichia coli, but due to potential bio￾processing benefits and high yield, the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris is be￾coming more popular. Without the need for selective pressure, the repetitive genes 
which encode protein polymers are integrated into the yeast genome, and many of the 
protein polymers expressed in P. pastoris have been successfully generated as se￾creted proteins. The primary benefit of secretory production is providing a first, highly 
effective purifying step. Using bench-top bioreactors, considerable amounts of pro￾tein polymers can be generated with minimum purifying effort. Furthermore, simple 
downstream processing is essential (Werten et al. 2019). 
6.7 ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF DIFFERENT FILLERS 
IN BIO-NANOCOMPOSITES 
6.7.1 METALLIC-BASED ANTIMICROBIAL BIO-NANOCOMPOSITES 
Metal-based nanoparticles or M-NPs storage does not affect food properties or 
packaging efficiency. Furthermore, M-NPs aid in enhancing mechanical proper￾ties, freshness indicators, water-vapor permeability, and antibacterial properties 
for food packaging (Kumar et al. 2021). Metal and metal oxide nanoparticles are 
easier to process and have more excellent thermal stability. Metal oxides provide 
an advantage by transporting essential mineral elements to the body (Tan et al. 
2021). Physical and/or chemical methods are used to obtain nanoparticles. 
Despite this ability, both methods are harmful to the environment and living 
organisms. For these reasons, there is a growing interest in eco-friendly methods 
for nanoparticle synthesis, known as “green synthesis” or “nanoparticle bio￾synthesis.” Besides being environmentally friendly, these techniques are bio￾compatible, profitable, easy to scale up on a larger scale, and safe, in addition, 
have higher performance and lower energy costs for temperature and pressure. 
The integration of metal ion release, oxidative stress, and nonoxidative damage 
affect cell structures in different ways after NP exposure, including cell wall 
damage, changes in metabolic gene expression, and damage effect on proteins 
and DNA (Guerrero Correa et al. 2020). The antimicrobial efficiency of nano￾materials is related to structural and physical properties like size, shape, and/or 
zeta potential (Gold et al. 2018). Bimetallic nanoparticles, formed by combining 
two metals, have recently emerged as promising and have antibacterial effi￾ciencies exceeding those of monometallic counterparts because of synergistic 
effects, diverse mechanisms of action, and a wide range of physicochemical 
properties (Arora, Thangavelu, and Karanikolos 2020). 
166 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 6.7.2 MONTMORILLONITE-BASED ANTIMICROBIAL BIO-NANOCOMPOSITES 
Nanoscale fillers such as layered silicate nanoclays like montmorillonite and kao￾linite are also promising candidates (Kushwaha and Srivastava 2018). Clay minerals 
are classified according to their source, structure, and chemistry. They are classified 
into four major groups based on their layered structure variations: the kaolinite 
group, the illite group, the chlorite group, and the montmorillonite (MMT) or 
smectite group. MMT is the most commonly used clay to prepare nanocomposites 
among all groups (Attaran, Hassan, and Wahit 2015). Montmorillonite is a mineral 
commonly used in various industrial applications to enhance the physical properties 
of nanocomposite materials (Rihayat et al. 2018). Casting method, melt-mixing 
process, and in-situ polymerization are the three main techniques reported for in￾corporating MMT in polymeric matrices (Vilarinho, Vaz, and Silva 2020). Recent 
studies of MTT bio-nanocomposites application in food packaging are summarized 
in Table 6.3.

chitosan and montmorillonite. 
MMT The use of dialdehyde chitosan as a 
crosslinking agent was investigated. As 
a consequence of the reinforcement of

required for food-packaging 
applications ( Laaraibi et al. 2018) 
Unmodified MMT/ polylactide matrix MMT The results showed that the surface 
wettability of the polymer 
nanocomposites did not differ 
significantly from that of the neat PLA

improvement in the mechanical and 
antimicrobial properties of the 
nanocomposite films, implying that 
unmodified montmorillonite could be 
used as a filler for polymer films in the 
packaging industry (Rapacz-Kmita 
et al. 2017)

Renewable Nanocomposites for Food Packaging 169 6.7.3 LAYERED DOUBLE HYDROXIDE (LDH)-BASED ANTIMICROBIAL 
BIO-NANOCOMPOSITES 
LDH particles are made up of layers of magnesium aluminum hydroxide. 
Hydroxide layers, unlike layered silicates, have a positive surface charge balanced 
by anions located between adjacent layers in the domains (Sorrentino, Gorrasi, and 
Vittoria 2007). The structure of LDHs results in high anionic molecule intercalation 
ability into interlayer regions via electrostatic interaction, anionic exchange capa￾city, and chemical versatility. Furthermore, their internal and external surfaces can 
be easily modified to have better chemical stability, a high specific surface area, and 
a targeting function, making them appealing for various applications (Choi and 
Choy 2011). Solid layered dispersion in polymers includes two significant steps: 
intercalation and exfoliation. A new method for preparing nanocomposites invol￾ving solid-state mixing at room temperature has recently been proposed; it is called 
ball milling. It has the significant advantage of not requiring solvent treatments or 
high temperatures (Sorrentino, Gorrasi, and Vittoria 2007). For examples of LDH 
application in bio-nanocomposites, see Table 6.3. 
6.8 SAFETY OF DIFFERENT ANTIMICROBIAL BIO￾NANOCOMPOSITES IN ACTIVE FOOD PACKAGING 
APPLICATIONS 
The emergence of nanocomposites has become one of the promising approaches 
in the food-packaging industry. So, it is essential to determine their safety and 
environmental impacts before the distribution process. Risk assessment in nano￾composite material is a real challenge in the food-safety sector that should be well￾identified because the migration of nanomaterial toward food or drinks hurts human 
health, animals, and the environment (Sharma, Jafari, and Sharma 2020). The mi￾gration of nanocomposite materials into food products demands specific informa￾tion about the chemistry of packaging material and the type of food to be included 
in the package. Identifying any material that may migrate from packaging material 
is essential for evaluating human exposure to these substances (Munro et al. 2009). 
6.8.1 REGULATION OF MIGRATION TEST 
Principles applied to migrating plastics into food matrices are also applicable in 
migrating nanomaterials into food packaging. However, this would not provide the 
proper level of food safety due to the variations in the physicochemical properties of 
nanomaterials and plastics that may indicate different safe limits for their migration 
(Honarvar, Hadian, and Mashayekh 2016). 
6.8.2 EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH FOR MIGRATION TEST 
Analytical migration testing with natural food is challenging since the complex 
compositions of most foodstuffs. Also, it will be a time-consuming process. The 
effective way to monitor the targeted substance migration using food simulants is 
170 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications based on each case’s specifics (Huang, Li, and Zhou 2015). Food simulants can be 
used as model systems that exhibit that are similar to food interactions. This in￾dicates that both the kinetics and extent of mass transport should be close to each 
other (Hernández-Munoz, Catalá, and Gavara 2002). According to the Spanish 
Association for Standardization and Certification 2005 (norm UNE-ENV 13130-1), 
water can be considered a stimulant for various food products like fruits, vegetables, 
and meat. Using acidified water solution (containing 3% acetic acid) is helpful for 
acidic aqueous food with a pH of less than 4.6 (Farhoodi et al. 2014). A 10% 
solution of ethanol can simulate alcoholic food. Oils produce mass transfer data 
close to natural fatty foods, whereas the analysis is challenging because of the 
abundance of oil components (Huang, Li, and Zhou 2015). Under specific condi￾tions of static or dynamic mode, temperature, and time, component extraction from 
the package is measured by linking it with the food simulant or the food (Avella 
et al. 2005). 
6.9 ANTIMICROBIAL RENEWABLE NANOCOMPOSITES IN 
ACTIVE FOOD PACKAGING MARKETING 
The use of renewable and sustainable materials in food packaging is a top priority in 
the packaging industry for increasing the value of the product in the global market. 
There are many features of using renewable nanocomposites in active packaging. 
However, several issues need to be addressed before reaching the market (Wyrwa 
and Barska 2017). Considering health issues that might happen due to the im￾plantation of active materials into packaging, there is no remarkable growth in using 
active packaging in the EU market despite all the exerted effort. Two main reasons 
explain the lack of diffusion in the EU market (Tiekstra et al. 2021). The first is 
acceptance, and the second is cost. Considering acceptance, it should be mentioned 
that the gap between science and industry makes the consumer is more con￾servative, regardless of all the innovations in the food-packaging industry. A study 
introduced by the Packaging Industry Research Association (PIRA) international 
indicates that the packaging converters and brand holders are the main rejectors to 
introducing active materials in the industry. About cost, the discussion is still on￾going whether the consumer will pay more for the sake of better quality and safety 
(Restuccia et al. 2010). 
6.10 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES 
Food packaging should allow for products to have a relatively long shelf life. It is 
the only way to reassure the safety and quality of the food during the distribution 
process to the markets. Antimicrobial-resistant packaging inhibits the growth of 
microorganisms that cause food spoilage and pathogenic effects. Nanotechnology 
enables the development of novel food packaging materials with high barrier 
properties and antimicrobial activity. Organic nanocomposites (such as biopolymer￾clay nano preparations) are the best candidates for using renewable nanocomposites 
for antibacterial active food packaging. Innovative packaging with improved 
characteristics is needed due to consumer demands for processed foods with 
Renewable Nanocomposites for Food Packaging 171 increased regulatory requirements, food safety issues, market globalization, and 
fewer preservatives. Several challenges in the food packaging industry must be 
addressed. The emergence of new methodologies for proper packaging was in￾evitable to guarantee food security. Active and intelligent packaging is new tech￾nology that provides food safety compared with traditional technologies.

7.1 INTRODUCTION 
Energy is one of the key points among the challenges set by climate change. In the 
race toward sustainability, renewable resources could provide a partial solution. The 
current depletion of the fossil fuels (such as oil and gas), their cost, and their en￾vironmental impacts make it necessary to develop greener energies. Among them, 
photovoltaic sector seems to be an interesting option given that solar energy is 
virtually inexhaustible and abundantly available all around the world. Light energy 
can be also converted into chemical energy using a photocatalyst to improve our 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003245261-9 181 processes regarding waste treatments (pollutants, gas, drugs, etc.). Moreover, pro￾ducing electricity from renewable and biosourced feedstock via fuel cells is a good 
way to reduce our dependency toward fossil fuels (X. Wu et al. 2020). Facing 
climate change and ecological awareness, it is thus becoming necessary to bring 
sustainable solutions for the materials used in energy-conversion systems like solar 
cells, fuels cells or in photocatalytic process. Therefore, the utilization of biomass 
could meet both concerns at stake: climate change and exhaustion of the fossil fuels. 
The use of biomass as a source of biofuels, energy, or building blocks for the 
chemical industry seems interesting to control the CO2 emissions and become 
free from fossil resources. In this context, lignin, one of the constituents of wood, 
waste from the paper industry, seems to be a good candidate but remains still little 
exploited. Indeed, controlled degradation of lignin enables to obtain biofuels, pre￾cursors for organic synthesis, or oligomers applied to functional materials in fuel 
cells, photovoltaic devices (Espinoza-Acosta et al. 2018) or as photocatalysts. 
Lignin is considered to be the second-most abundant and renewable compound 
in nature. It is a phenolic macromolecule mainly made of three crosslinked aromatic 
monomers: the H unit (hydroxyphenyl), the G unit (guaiacyl), and the S unit 
(syringyl). The proportions of such moieties are strongly dependent on the plant 
species from which the lignin is extracted (Mei et al. 2019). Industrial lignin is 
mainly derived from the pulp and paper industry, as well as from by-products of the 
cellulosic ethanol industry, and it is widely and cheaply available (Zevallos Torres 
et al. 2020). In paper industry, raw wood undergoes one of three treatments: a sulfite 
pulping, a soda pulping, or a kraft pulping, all used to separate cellulose from 
hemicellulose and lignin left in the so-called black liquor. Lignin sulfonate (LS) is 
retrieved from sulfite pulping, alkali lignin (AL) from soda pulping, and kraft lignin 
(KL) from kraft pulping. With a carbon content of up to 60%, lignin is an ideal 
carbon precursor because it is rich in active functional groups, such as phenolic 
hydroxyl groups, alcohol hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, carbonyl groups, etc 
(Nguyen et al. 2021). The structure and morphology of lignin can be easily adjusted 
by different methods. Therefore, it also has excellent flexibility and designability as 
a carbon precursor. Moreover, the exploitation of nanolignin (lignin in its nano￾form) is currently the subject of a tremendous amount of research (Z. Zhang, 
Terrasson, et Guénin 2021; Negui et al. 2022). Industrial lignin can be used as a 
carbon source to prepare lignin carbon-based functional materials or nanomaterials 
with high added value (Cao et al. 2021). The functional materials can play a role in 
protecting the environment, which is important for the green and sustainable de￾velopment of the economy (Xuefeng Zhang et al. 2021). 
7.2 APPLICATIONS OF LIGNIN IN PHOTOVOLTAIC DEVICES 
Only a small part of the radiations emitted by the sun reaches earth, with a total 
power 1.8 × 1011 MW. Most of that energy goes unattended, although it would 
cover more than the global energy consumption of humankind (Parida, Iniyan, et 
Goic 2011). The recent advancements in technology, the growing need for energy, 
and the threat of fossil fuels on the environment gave a motive for harvesting some 
of that solar power and converting it into electricity. The steady progress in the field 
182 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications of photovoltaics allowed an increase in power efficiencies of solar cells (Green et al. 
2021) and a reduction of their production costs, particularly with the usage of or￾ganic materials in the fabrication of the photovoltaic components (Yu, Zheng, et 
Huang 2014). Crystalline silicon-based solar cells nowadays represent most of the 
photovoltaic market. This technology permits to reach photoconversion efficiency 
(PCE) up to 25% (in laboratory) and is based on the use of doped mono- or poly￾crystalline silicon. Since the production of crystalline silicon is still both financially 
and energetically costly, amorphous silicon is also incorporated in the photovoltaic 
modules, although this leads to a drop in the photoconversion efficiency (to 10%) 
(Matsui et al. 2015). To reduce the fabrication costs of solar cells and to make 
photovoltaic energy more competitive on the market of renewable energies, other 
technologies have been developed. A first type of technology uses thin layers 
of inorganic materials, such as GaAs, CdTe or CuInGaSe2, with PCE up to 28% 
(Efaz et al. 2021). However, some elements used in the materials, because of their 
toxicity to environment (cadmium, arsenic), need a specific and therefore expensive 
recycling process. Another promising option is based on the integration of organic 
semiconductors in photovoltaic devices. They meet a strong development due to 
their flexibility and lightness, and their supposedly moderate cost and environ￾mental impact. Two types of devices have been developed with organic materials: 
organic solar cells (OSCs with polymers (Z. Li, Chueh, et Jen 2019) or small 
molecules (Mishra et Bäuerle 2012)) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) both 
with efficiencies over 10%. The most up-to-date technology, perovskite solar cells 
(PSCs), derived from DSSC and based on lead halide perovskite instead of dyes, 
have permitted to reach PCE of 25% (Jeong et al. 2021). 
The first prototypes of OSCs, developed in the 1970s, are made of organic small 
molecules (or polymers) sandwiched as a single layer between two metallic elec￾trodes (Schottky cell) (Morel et al. 1978; Ghosh et Feng 1978). The active semi￾conducting organic material absorbs a photon; this generates a hole-electron pair 
that migrates to the interface and separates to create a photoelectric current. Charge 
recombination within the layer or at the interface, severely limiting the PCE, is now 
alleviated with upgraded architectures integrating two organic materials: a donating 
one (D) and accepting one (A). In 1986, Tang developed bilayer solar cells 
(BLSCs), easy to build: D and A materials layered with a planar D/A heterojunction 
are inserted between a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and a back￾contact (Tang 1986). BLSCs have further been improved since then. Yet, the in￾terface has a limited surface area, and the active D layer is very thin (shallow 
diffusion of the exciton) with a reduced optical density of the film: consequently, 
the photon absorption and the PCE are limited (Peumans, Yakimov, et Forrest 
2003). In bulk heterojunction OSCs (BHJ-SCs), D and A materials interpenetrate 
within a single active layer. The D/A interface is much larger and the PCE higher 
(up to 10%), but the fabrication needs more control (Ilmi, Haque, et Khan 2018). 
At the beginning of the 1990s, Grätzel’s team developed DSSC (Kay et Grätzel 
1996). Such hybrid devices are typically made of an organic dye (Mariotti et al. 
2020) (e.g., Ru or Ir complexes, oligothiophene or triarylamine compounds; see 
Figure 7.1) covalently bonded onto an n-type semiconducting inorganic oxide 
(generally titanium dioxide) and a soluble redox mediator, such as triiodide 
Lignin in Energy Conversion 183 ion/iodide ion couple (I3
-
/I-
). The whole system is inserted between two fluorine￾doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes, one being transparent (glass) and the other 
covered with platinum (Figure 7.2). In PSC, developed in the late 2000s (Kojima 
et al. 2009; M. Liu, Johnston, et Snaith 2013), the dye is replaced by a hybrid 
organic lead-halide perovskite layer also deposited onto an n-type semiconductor 
(TiO2), the redox mediator by solid hole transporting materials (HTM) such as 
SpiroMeOTAD and the platinum electrode by a gold back contact. Some of the 
commonly used perovskite materials are MAPbI3 (= CH3NH3PbI3) or FAPbI3 (= 
H2N-CH=NH2PbI3). 
The operation of such cells is based on a photoelectrochemical principle. The 
absorber, dye, or perovskite absorbs a photon to reach an excited state; it can then 
transmit an electron into the conduction band of TiO2. That electron is led to the 
external circuit via the FTO anode. The photo-oxidized absorber is regenerated to 
its ground state by electron transfer from the redox mediator or the HTM. The 
oxidized mediator diffuses through to the electrode, where platinum enables its 
reduction. The hole-transporting material (HTM) allows the release of holes to the 
counter electrode (Au) to close the circuit. 
The photovoltaic properties of the components are obtained by measuring the 
current density J, as a function of the voltage applied between the device terminals 
FIGURE 7.1 Examples of dyes used in DSSC and SpiroOMETAD chemical structures. 
FIGURE 7.2 Operating principle of DSSC or PSC. 
184 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications (plotting J against V) under illumination and in the dark (Figure 7.3). Four values 
are obtained, characteristic of the device performances: the open-circuit voltage 
VOC, the short-circuit current density JSC, the fill factor FF and the photoconversion 
efficiency η. The open circuit voltage VOC and the fill factor FF are device-bound 
parameters while the current density JSC is dependent on the absorber and the re￾generation rate of the redox mediator or the hole carrier rate in the HTM. 
Lignin can be used in OSCs, DSSCs, or PSCs as internal active material. 
Incidentally, some examples of utilization of lignin as device-protecting film were 
reported. More precisely, lignin modification by selective removal of chromo￾phores yields a UV-absorbent lignocellulose nanopaper with 90% optical trans￾mittance, haze, and high thermal and water stability. Application of a transparent 
lignocellulose film over a GaAs solar cell, as an advanced light-management 
layer, allows a higher PCE even under damp conditions (Jiang et al. 2020; 
M. Zhu et al. 2016). 
7.2.1 LIGNIN IN POLYMER SOLAR CELLS 
Lignin and some of its derivatives could prove efficient in the design of polymer 
solar cells. Water-soluble lignosulfonate (LS) or alkyl chain cross-linked lig￾nosulfonate polymers (ALS) each mixed with poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) 
show interesting hole-transporting properties (Yuan Li et Hong 2015; Hong et al. 
2015). The first composite exhibits a better hole mobility than the latter thanks 
to a higher phenolic group content. With such hole mobility (maximum value 
of 3.75 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s
−1 for LS), they could potentially be applied as polymeric 
p-type semiconductors. Poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonic 
acid) (PEDOT/PSS) composite, a widely used cost-efficient and robust hole￾transporting layer (HTL) in various organic electronic devices, was successfully 
replaced by PEDOT/LS and PEDOT/ALS equivalents. PEDOT/LS material showed 
a comparable performance as HTM to that of conventional PEDOT/PSS with a PCE 
of 5.79% in [ITO/HTM/PTB7:PC71BM/Al] devices (Figure 7.4). This was un￾expected because of the amorphous organization of LS as opposed to the 
FIGURE 7.3 J/V plot and characteristic values of a solar cell. 
Lignin in Energy Conversion 185 crystallinity of PSS. Sulfonated-acetone-formaldehyde (SAF) grafted with alkali 
lignin exhibits an amorphous structure and p-type semiconducting properties, with a 
hole-mobility of 2.27 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s
−1 (Hong et al. 2016). 
Hong et al. utilized grafted SAF lignin (GSL) to obtain a homogeneous PEDOT/ 
GSL as HTL in an [ITO/HTL/PTB7:PC71BM/PFN/Al] solar cell with 8.47% effi￾ciency. A cathode interfacial layer has been devised using demethylate kraft lignin 
(DKL) mixed with perylene diimide (PDI) (Hu et al. 2020). The phenol hydroxyl 
groups of DKL bond with the amino groups of PDI forming an isotropic electron￾transfer network. When applied in an OSC, up to 16% PCE could be reached 
(slightly over that of a similar cell using pure PDI). 
7.2.2 LIGNIN IN DYE SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS 
Lignin as an organic material offers different usages in DSSC. Its derivatives can 
be used as absorber, electrode materials, or as electrolyte. Lignophenols, functional 
polymers obtained by chemical modification of native lignin, present a strong ab￾sorbance in the visible region and a fluorescence emission observed at 400–600 nm. 
These photophysical characteristics allow lignophenols to be used as photosensitizers 
in DSSCs. Aoyagi and Funaoka (Aoyagi et Funaoka 2004; 2006) designed DSSCs 
sensitized by polymeric lignophenolic compounds (e.g., lignophenol-based phenol, p￾cresol, catechol, resorcinol, and pyrogallol). Those lignophenolic compounds show 
strong affinity to TiO2 nanoparticles through both phenolic hydroxyl groups and 1,1- 
bis(aryl)propanyl structures, respectively anchoring and stacking to the TiO2 surface. 
p-Cresol-type lignophenols applied in DSSCs indicate 0.11% photoconversion effi￾ciency which is almost twice the value achieved with phenol-type lignophenol-based 
DSSCs (Aoyagi et Funaoka 2004). Oligomers of p-cresol type lignophenols ad￾ditionally enhance the efficiency of DSSCs up to 3.61%. This is probably due to the 
smaller molecular weight of lignophenols that allow higher adsorption capacities 
around the surface of nanoporous TiO2 (Aoyagi et Funaoka 2006). DSSCs perfor￾mances are impacted by the properties of lignophenols, depending on the lignin 
source, phenol type, and molecular weight. Lignin can also be applied as a carbon￾based material for photo-anode (Chou et al. 2015) or counter electrode (Ma et al. 
2016) in DSSC. Chou et al. have charred and mixed bamboo lignin with TiO2 to form 
a powder composite used as an efficient photo-anode material (Chou et al. 2015). 
Using ruthenium complex N719 as an absorber, a DSSC made with a photo-anode of 
FIGURE 7.4 Chemical structures of PC71BM and PTB7. 
186 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications TiO2/bamboo charcoal mixture shows an efficiency of 5.4%, while it is only 3.6% 
with a conventional photo-anode made of TiO2. The higher value is due to a stronger 
current density JSC (17.82 vs 9.01 mA/cm²) obtained thanks to the better capability of 
dye absorption from the composite. 
Electrospun carbon nanofibers were synthesized by Ma et al. from alkali lignin as 
material for counter electrode (Ma et al. 2016). Flexible lignin-derived carbon and Pt 
nanoparticle-decorated lignin-derived carbon counter electrodes were applied in 
DSSCs prototypes that presented efficiencies of 6.75% and 6.94%, respectively. 
These results can be compared to Pt-based DSSCs of 7.29% efficiencies. Zhao et al. 
fabricated also flexible carbon nano-fiber layer from lignin mixed with PVA solution 
by calcination at 1500°C (Y. Zhao et al. 2018). This layer was used as a binder-free 
counter electrode for DSSCs with conversion efficiency 7.6% against 7.67% for Pt 
counter electrode. Pre-oxidized kraft lignin cross-linked by poly(ethylene glycol) 
(PEG) chains has been used as a quasi-solid-state matrix for the I3
-
/I- electrolyte in 
DSSCs (de Haro et al. 2021). It allows a much longer stability under illumination 
(constant PCE over a month) than that of DSSCs incorporating the state-of-the-art 
carboxymethylcellulose membranes (PCE constantly decreasing to around 25% of its 
initial value over a month). Dopamine-lignin nanoparticles (L-NP) have a promising 
applicability to manufacture optical films with haze, fluorescence, and room￾temperature phosphorescence when used with poly(vinyl-alcohol) (PVA) (X. Wang 
et al. 2021). Covering the surface of a solar cell (N719 as absorber) with such film 
positively affects its efficiency by improving its light-harvesting character, resulting 
in a slight increase in the power conversion efficiency from 3.96 to 4.13%. These 
studies brought to light an alternative to expensive counter electrodes using renew￾able, cost-effective, and eco-friendly biopolymers for DSSCs applications, potentially 
paving the way for flexible DSSCs. 
7.2.3 LIGNIN IN PEROVSKITE SOLAR CELLS 
PEDOT:PSS is a common HTM in inverted perovskite solar cells. Its drawbacks 
are a low work function (WF) and a high hydrophilicity, resulting in a poor PCE 
and a weak stability in time, especially under atmospheric conditions. Replacing 
it by a composite of PEDOT and polydopamine copolymer (Figure 7.5) with 
FIGURE 7.5 Molecular structure of PDA:PEDOT:LS and its film structure deposited on 
ITO (from Huang et al. 2018). 
Lignin in Energy Conversion 187 lignosulfonate showed improvements (Huang et al. 2018). The phenol-quinone￾PEDOT backbone enables a higher PCE (with WF=5.45 eV and VOC=1.02 V). 
The pH around 5 and the excellent waterproofness due to the crosslinking of the 
copolymer with LS renders the inverted PSC mounted with PDA:PEDOT:LS much 
more durable. PCE and JSC remained almost unchanged for over a month under 
ambient air conditions in a non-encapsulated device while they drop by 58% and 
72%, respectively, with PEDOT:PSS. 
When LS is used as a template with PEDOT, its active phenol groups and un￾saturated carbon-carbon double bonds form covalent bonding between both poly￾mers and a thermal cross-linking activity (Yuda Li et al. 2019). This provides 
PEDOT/LS with a superior homogeneity, an excellent waterproofness and a high 
work function (over 5 eV). Wu et al. measured a hole-mobility in PEDOT/GSL of 
3.75 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s
−1 and formulated a homogeneous composite (Y. Wu et al. 
2016). The application of PEDOT/LS and PEDOT/GSL in inverted MAPI per￾ovskite solar cells offers 12.9% and 14.9% PCE respectively (against 12.1%–12.6% 
with PEDOT/PSS) (Yuda Li et al. 2019; Y. Wu et al. 2016). Bao et al. even 
claim a 17.8% PCE with PEDOT/PSS-PEDOT/GSL bilayer at the anode-perovskite 
interface (Bao et al. 2017). 
Table 7.1 offers an overview of the performances of various PSCs containing 
lignin-derivatives. 
7.3 APPLICATIONS OF LIGNIN IN FUEL CELLS 
Fuel cells (FCs) are electrochemical devices that, like batteries, convert chemical 
energy into electricity. Since their invention by William Grove in 1838 and 
their first commercial use in 1932, fuel cells have reached a wide range of ap￾plications for transport, stationary, and portable power appliances. At the anode, 
the oxidation of the fuel generates electrons that flow as an electric current via 
an external circuit to the cathode, where the oxidizing agent (generally air) is

188 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications reduced. Between the electrodes, ions diffuse through an electrolyte to close the 
circuit. Historically, the first fuel cells have been designed with liquid electro￾lytes, either basic in alkaline fuel cells (AFC) or acidic in phosphoric acid fuel 
cells (PAFC), soaked in a porous matrix. AFCs operate at low temperature, with 
60% efficiency and are cheap although sensitive to CO2 poisoning and quite 
short-lasting. PAFCs are heavy, bulky, and expensive, run at higher temperature 
(150°C–200°C) with a better tolerance to impurities and a longer durability, and 
reach 40% efficiency (up to 85% with heat and electricity co-generation). 
Improvements have been made by using polymeric membranes instead of li￾quid electrolytes to design polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) 
often used as benchmark. PEMFCs generally contain an acidic electrolyte and are 
therefore also named proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. All those FCs are 
powered by hydrogen as the fuel, either directly fed to the system from a storage 
tank or generated within the fuel cell system by reforming hydrogen-rich fuels 
(e.g., methanol, ethanol, hydrocarbons). Their oxidizing agent is oxygen, gen￾erally taken from the air. In such conditions, the two redox semi-reactions are: 
at the anode: H2 2H + 2e +
at the cathode: O2 + 4H+ + 4e 2H2O
Overall reaction: 2H2 + O2 2H2O
Some FCs have been devised to operate in a reversible manner. When in use as a 
source, they classically produce energy (electricity and heat) from hydrogen and 
oxygen. Conversely, they can also use electricity to electrolyze water into hy￾drogen and oxygen. As chemical energy storage device, reversible FCs could be a 
key to make the most of intermittent renewable energies (e.g., solar power, wind 
power) with a smooth electricity provision on demand. FCs are characterized by 
three parameters. Open-circuit voltage (VOC in V) is the maximum operating 
voltage of the cells and is determined by the thermodynamic of the reaction 
thanks to Nernst laws. The short current density (JSC, in mA/cm²) is defined as the 
maximum current density delivered by the cell at low voltage. The maximum 
power density (in W/cm²) can be obtained by multiplying the voltage by the 
current density. The efficiency (in %) of the FC is the ratio of the electricity 
produced over the fuel consumed. Incidentally, the heat produced by the FC can 
be included in the calculation of an overall efficiency. A classification of the FCs 
has emerged primarily based on the type of electrolyte in them (Figure 7.6). The 
class of a fuel cell determines, among other factors: the electro-chemical reac￾tions occurring, the kind of catalysts required, the operating temperature range 
and the fuel employed. Each type of cells gathers a whole set of characteristics, 
with their advantages and limitations to the potential applications (Steele et 
Heinzel 2001). 
More recent works have permitted to develop fuel cells powered by other fuels 
than dihydrogen. For instance, in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), methanol, 
Lignin in Energy Conversion 189 generally mixed with water, is fed directly to the anode. The electrolyte is a 
sulfonated polymer. As a liquid, methanol is much easier to transport and supply 
to the public using the current infrastructures. DMFCs are mostly used for por￾table applications, such as mobile phones and laptop computers. Direct carbon 
fuel cells (DCFCs) utilize solid carbon as the fuel. Although less easy to deliver 
and feed than gases or liquids, solid carbon may prove much cheaper and 
easily bio-sourced from natural plant polymers after carbonization. DCFCs 
convert chemical energy into electricity by direct oxidation of the carbon into 
pure CO2. That emission needs to be dealt with (e.g., sequestration), but the 
energy / CO2 ratio is much more interesting than that of burnt hydrocarbons (e.g., 
coal power plant). Since the gaseous product spontaneously separates from the 
reagent, the theoretical yield of DCFCs is 100% with ca. 80% electrical effi￾ciency. Some other fuel cells operate directly with carbon materials from biomass 
assisted by light (solar-induced hybrid fuel cells = SIH FC), heat (solid oxide 
fuel cell = SOFC) or microorganisms (microbial fuel cell = MFC or biophoto fuel 
cell = BPFC). 
FIGURE 7.6 Examples of FCs with classification and associated reactions. 
190 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 7.3.1 LIGNIN AS FUEL OR MEDIATOR IN FC 
A DCFC has been designed by Lima et al. to operate directly with kraft lignin 
and lignin sulfonate with no prior carbonization (Lima et al. 2013). The lignin 
anode, the crystalline composite electrolyte, and the mixed salt cathode are each 
pressed into tablets and stacked in a furnace. At the operating temperature of 
560°C, a VOC of ca. 0.7 V was measured, while the JSC was 43–57 mA/cm² with 
pure lignin and increased to 83–101 mA/cm² when lignin was mixed with active 
carbon. Direct biomass fuel cells (DBFCs) were fabricated back in 1985 to run 
with lignin (Weetal, Forsyth, et Hertl 1985). Both graphite felt electrodes were 
soaked with salt solutions containing anthraquinone sulfonate as the electron 
mediator between the fuel and the electrode. The cathodic side was maintained 
under oxygen at pH 1. The anodic compartment was kept under nitrogen atmo￾sphere at pH 12 and LS or crude black liquor (containing KL) was added as fuel. 
Such DBFC produced 1 kW.h electricity from 1 kg of LS. Lignin-containing 
biomass has also been used in other types of DBFCs, running at low temperature 
(< 100°C). The biomass flow FC built by Gong et al. works with two redox ions 
pairs (Gong et al. 2017). Wheat straw is fed to a closed circuit containing iron 
ions. At 100°C, in the anode tank, the straw is degraded by Fe(III) oxidation. 
The Fe2+ ions generated then flow through the graphite felt anode where they lose 
electrons (Figure 7.7). The Fe3+ are recovered and recirculated to the tank. In the 
cathode solution, VO2
+ gets reduced to VO2+ in the graphite felt cathode, and 
regenerated to VO2
+ by oxygen oxidation. That biomass flow FC exhibits a power 
output of 100 mW/cm². 
The polyoxometalates (POMs) mediated DBFC proposed by Zhao and Zhu 
operates with phosphomolybdic acid as a charge carrier between the anode and 
the tank where it is regenerated (X. Zhao et Zhu 2016). This regeneration occurs 
FIGURE 7.7 Schematic representation of the wheat straw direct biomass fuel cell (from 
Gong et al. 2017). 
Lignin in Energy Conversion 191 by oxidation of KL in contact with the circulating POMs and is activated by heat 
or light irradiation. Kaneko and Ueno have designed a single-chamber DBFC 
(Kaneko et Ueno 2013). The FTO-based anode is dipping in the electrolyte with 
solubilized or suspended biomass fuel. The cathode consists in a membrane 
electrode assembly set as an external wall of the cell compartment, one side in 
contact with the solution, the other with ambient air. Such DBFC was success￾fully operated with LS as a fuel to generate VOC of 0.49–0.55V, JSC between 
270 and 440 µA/cm² and a power density of 30–60 µW/cm². Polyoxometalates 
(POMs) have proven an effective catalyst and charge-carrier mediator in liquid￾catalyst FCs, for the direct use of solid fuels such as cellulose, starch, lignin and 
even raw biomasses (W. Liu, Mu, et Deng 2014). In such devices, a solution of 
POMs circulates in one or both cell compartments between the electrode and a 
tank. POM oxidizes the incoming biomass in the anodic tank and in turn gets 
oxidized in contact with the carbon anode. A similar POM-mediation can occur in 
the other part between entering oxygen and the carbon cathode. 
Biophotofuel cells (BPFCs) generate electricity by photodecomposition of bio￾mass derivatives, either liquid or solubilized in aqueous solution (Nemoto et al. 
2007). It can incidentally cleanse water polluted by carbon solutes. They are 
mounted with a nanoporous TiO2 photoanode and an O2-reducing cathode. Various 
solutions of glucose, aminoacids, cellulose sulfate, and sodium lignosulfonate have 
proven to be potential fuels, photochemically decomposed into water, CO2 and 
nitrogen gas with up to over 85% photoefficiency. Solar-induced hybrid fuel cells 
have recently been developed to upcycle natural polymers such as cellulose, starch 
and lignin, and even raw biomasses (W. Liu et al. 2014). Direct use of solid fuels is 
challenging at low temperature because catalytic systems in FC are generally ac￾tivated by heat. Polyoxometalates have proven an effective solution since they act 
as a photocatalyst (thus activated by light irradiations instead of heat) and charge 
carrier. An example of SIH FC using phosphomolybdic acid as the photocatalyst 
and directly fueled by cellulose generates a power density reaching 0.72 mW.cm−2, 
i.e., almost 100 times higher than that of cellulose-based MFCs and close to that 
of the best MFCs reported in literature. Interestingly, it is possible to design SIH 
FCs inert to most organic and inorganic contaminants present in the fuels. MFCs 
are generally mounted with two electrode compartments separated by a proton 
exchange membrane. At one of the electrodes, the redox reaction occurs with a 
variety of biodegradable substrates as fuel, thanks to the action of microorganisms. 
Most MFCs use an organic fuel catabolized by a bacterium at the bioanode. A 
single-chamber MFC has been successfully powered by lignin degradation products 
(Shewa et al. 2016). LS was first photocatalytically treated in the presence of ti￾tanium dioxide under UV light. The carefully bred microbial mixture at the bioa￾node, fed with pre-treated LS, generated maximum current and power densities of 
0.868 mA/cm² and 0.248 mW/cm², respectively. The bioelectricity generated this 
way still has low power and current density but could feed small devices such as 
biosensors. Lignin also showed an interesting activity as a mediator in a dual￾chamber MFC fueled with ethanol-containing wastewater (Sakdaronnarong et al. 
2013). It enabled a higher efficiency since it inhibits the methanogenic micro￾organisms thus favoring hydrogen production at the anode. 
192 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications In solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), the electrolyte is a hard, nonporous ceramic 
compound. SOFCs operate at very high temperatures (up to 1000°C), which makes 
precious-metal catalysts non-necessary and enables the cells to reform hydrocarbon 
fuels internally, both reducing cost. Therefore, SOFCs can run directly with natural 
gas (fossil fuel), biogas (obtained from fermentation of biomass) and syngas 
(synthetic gas made from gasification of biomass, including lignin) (Karl et al. 
2009; Athanasiou et al. 2007). The cathode is fed by oxygen gas that reduces to 
oxide ions; oxide ions diffuse through the solid oxide electrolyte; at the anode, 
hydrogen gas, carbon monoxide, methane, methanol and possible other gases are 
oxidized into water and carbon dioxide. The efficiency is around 60% at converting 
fuel to electricity and up to 85% in co-generation. As a result of the temperature, 
SOFCs can only be used for stationary applications. 
7.3.2 LIGNIN AS MEMBRANES IN FC 
Membranes are one of the most important constituents of fuel cells. They must 
be permeable to protons to ensure the closure of the electrical circuit. Sulfonated 
polymers like Nafion® are commonly used in this type of application. Garcia￾Valls’ team (Xiao Zhang, Benavente, et Garcia-Valls 2005; X Zhang, Glusen, et 
Garciavalls 2006) investigated the substitution of these materials with membranes 
prepared from the incorporation of lignosulfonates in polysulfone matrix in 
DMFCs. The sulfonated lignin, a waste produced from paper industry, could 
represent a cheaper alternative to the currently used materials. The polysulfone 
polymer is a hydrophobic, chemically resistant material that could play a role in 
preventing the methanol from crossing the membrane. The studied membranes 
were prepared by coating a film of a mixture of polysulfone and lignosulfonate on 
a glass surface and precipitating the film in water. Different membranes from 
77 to 178 µm thickness (depending on the lignosulfonate ratio and the tem￾perature of precipitation) were obtained. The permeability of the membranes to 
protons and methanol was studied. It was found that the lignosulfonate-containing 
membranes showed a good ability to transport protons, but with an observed 
current density five times lower than the Nafion® based material. One of the 
advantages of the new membranes was that its methanol permeability was much 
lower than the standard Nafion® membranes. Further investigation, especially in 
the process for the membrane preparation, was needed to improve the perfor￾mances of these new materials. 
7.3.3 LIGNIN AS ELECTRODE MATERIALS IN FC 
Another potential use of lignin in fuel cells consists in preparing activated carbons 
from it for applications in electrodes. These activated carbons could be doped with 
heteroatoms or functionalized with metallic nanoparticles. 
For example, in 2014, Fong, Smirnova et al. prepared electrospun carbon na￾nofibers from lignin with silver nanoparticles. For the preparation of the nanofibers, 
Kraft lignin and polyvinyl alcohol were dispersed in distilled water (Lai, Zhou, 
et al. 2014). The dispersion was then electrospun and the nanofibers were gathered 
Lignin in Energy Conversion 193 as mats and desiccated before being carbonized. Silver nanoparticles were deposited 
onto the nanofibers (Figure 7.8) and the obtained electrocatalytic system was 
characterized in cyclic voltammetry (Lai, Kolla, et al. 2014). It showed that the 
electrode consisting of 15 wt% Ag deposited on lignin-based carbon nanofibers 
exhibited a higher oxidation and reduction current density in oxygen reduction 
reaction (ORR) than a commercial Pt/C system. The lignin-derived material 
could represent a cheaper and efficient electrocatalytic system for ORR in alkaline 
fuel cells. 
Lignin-based activated carbon could also be used as a support for platinum 
nanoparticles to prepare electrocatalysts in oxidation of alcohols, for potential 
applications in direct methanol fuel cells. In 2017, Rodriguez-Mirasol et al. 
prepared different electrocatalysts based on carbon fibers obtained from lignin 
(García-Mateos et al. 2017). The materials were obtained by electrospinning a 
solution containing lignin, ethanol, phosphoric acid, and a platinum (II) salt to 
form lignin fibers, which were carbonized to form carbon nanofibers with high 
porosity and well-dispersed platinum nanoparticles (around 2 nm). They were 
tested in the electro-oxidation of simple alcohols and exhibited interesting per￾formances regarding the current density, with relatively low onset potential and 
high specific oxidation currents. More recently, another research team prepared 
similar electrocatalysts by reducing the platinum (II) salt by NaBH4 and depos￾iting the formed metallic nanoparticles on carbon dots (around 4.7 nm) (X. Li, Lv, 
et Pan 2019). This carbon support was obtained by carbonization of lignin at high 
temperatures (500°C–800°C). The prepared Pt nanocatalysts were then evaluated 
in the electro-oxidation of methanol in acidic solutions for potential application 
in direct methanol fuel cells. They proved to be more stable and active than 
commercially available catalysts, such as Pt/C (40% Pt), for example. 
Electrodes prepared from lignin could also be functionalized with titanium di￾oxide. Ibrahim’s team extracted lignin from palm oil waste and used it to synthesize 
graphene oxide after carbonization and oxidation with nitrate and permanganate 
(Yaqoob et al. 2021). Solvothermal deposition of the metal oxide was then per￾formed to functionalize the materials with less than 100nm TiO2 nanoparticles. The 
composite materials were then grafted onto graphite rods, which could serve as rigid 
support and current collector. The usefulness of the prepared electrodes was eval￾uated by incorporating them in MFC and analyzing them in cyclic voltammetry and 
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The studied electrodes showed a very 
FIGURE 7.8 SEM images of the Ag/nanofibers as electrocatalytic systems loading with (a) 
11 wt%, (b) 15 wt%, and (c) 25 wt% of Ag contents (from Lai, Kolla, et al. 2014). 
194 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications good stability and were used in a 90-day operation. No toxicity to the biofilm was 
observed. The presence of TiO2 increased the electron transfer rate and the energy 
generation in comparison to electrodes prepared without the metal oxide. Moreover, 
when charged with a solution of lead (+II) cations, the studied MFC showed a 90% 
removal of the heavy metal at the end of the operation. Preparing anodes from 
lignin could represent a cost-effective and efficient method both for heavy metal ion 
removal and electric energy generation. 
Lignin could also be used to synthesize activated carbons doped with het￾eroatoms to prepare materials for electrocatalytic purposes. The natural presence 
of certain elements in commercial lignin can sometimes be sufficient to produce 
doped carbon materials. When calcium lignosulfonate is chosen as the starting 
material, the presence of calcium and sulfur atoms in the final biocarbon will 
greatly improve the electrochemical properties of the materials. This was proven 
by Demir, Gupta et al. (Demir et al. 2018) when they prepared high surface area 
carbon materials with a porous structure. Used as electrodes in ORR, these ac￾tivated carbons displayed a high efficiency in electrocatalysis. They could re￾present an inexpensive and sustainable alternative to other commercial electrode 
materials. With the goal to enhance the electrocatalytic properties of the carbon 
materials, the lignin could be modified with heteroatom containing functions. For 
example, lignin obtained from beech wood by alkaline treatment could be 
functionalized by aromatic nitration with nitric acid and a catalytic amount of 
sulfuric acid (Graglia et al. 2016). After the reaction, the obtained lignin showed a 
6.7 wt.% nitrogen content as proven by microanalysis. This result was compatible 
with a nitro-functinalization of 50% of the aromatic rings in the lignin. The ni￾trated lignin was then carbonized in a nitrogen atmosphere. To produce analogs, 
some nitrated lignin samples were reduced into amino compounds before car￾bonization. The obtained N-doped activated carbons proved to have high porosity 
and surface area. They were evaluated in electrocatalysis for the ORR and po￾tential applications in fuel cells. All the nitrogen-doped materials had a higher 
catalytic efficiency in comparison to carbons obtained from the same lignin used 
without modification. The best performances were observed with carbons pre￾pared from nitrated lignin (without reduction to anilines). A half-wave potential 
of 0.85V (versus the renewable hydrogen electrode) was produced in this case, a 
result comparable to other electrocatalysts (without noble metals) found in the 
literature, but with a cheaper and more sustainable material. 
Another way of preparing doped activated carbons derived from lignin is by 
simply mixing lignin with other heteroatom-containing molecules or salts before 
the carbonization process (no chemical reaction between lignin and the added 
molecules is involved in this case). For example, Peng’s team added melamine 
and urea, as a source of nitrogen, and NaCl/ZnCl2, as pore-forming agents, to a 
dispersion of lignin in water before carbonization (Shen et al. 2020). The obtained 
carbon materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, which 
showed a nanoporous structure (Figure 7.9) with a homogeneous distribution of 
not only nitrogen but also sulfur and chlorine. The performances of these ma￾terials were tested in electrocatalytic ORR by voltammetry. The lignin-derived 
carbon showed activity and stability higher than the commercially available Pt/C, 
Lignin in Energy Conversion 195 with a maximum reached power density at around 780 MW.cm−2, indicating 
potential interesting applications in PEMFC. A similar strategy was previously 
used by He et al. to prepare nitrogen and sulfur-doped carbon nanoplatelets 
(Xianlei Zhang et al. 2016). Alkaline lignin was used as a source of both carbon 
and sulfur and was mixed with urea (source of nitrogen) before pyrolysis. The 
N,S-doped carbon materials were then evaluated in eletrocatalysis for ORR 
in alkaline or acidic media. It was found that the presence of both nitrogen and 
sulfur had a synergetic effect on the electrocatalytic properties. Thanks to the 
high surface area and pore-rich structure, a high catalytic activity was observed 
with results superior to a commercial Pt/C electrode as far as the half-wave 
potential is concerned. These promising results could be applied to fuel cell 
devices. 
Table 7.2 sums up the different applications of lignin and its nanomaterials in 
fuel cells. 
7.4 APPLICATIONS OF LIGNIN IN PHOTOCATALYSIS 
Photocatalysis technology mainly refers to the use of photocatalysts to convert 
green and renewable solar energy into chemical energy, which is environmentally 
friendly, economical, and safe (Kar et al. 2021). It is considered one of the most 
promising approaches for solving the current energy crisis and environmental 
pollution facing the world. Photocatalyst materials mainly initiate redox reactions 
and can be widely used in the degradation of organic pollutants, CO2 reduction, 
photolytic hydrogen production, self-cleaning materials, etc. (Saravanan et al. 
2021). Photocatalysts are photoresponsive compounds that may induce, when ex￾cited by light irradiation, chemical transformations by energy transfer, most often 
realized by electron transfer (S. Zhu et Wang 2017). They are typically transition 
metal complexes (Teegardin et al. 2016) (e.g., [Ru(bpy)3], organic dyes (Marin 
et al. 2012) (e.g., xanthenes, porphyrins, phtalocyanines, eosin Y) and colloidal 
FIGURE 7.9 SEM images of nanoporous materials obtain by carbonization of lignin (a) and 
lignin with ZnCl2 and NaCl in ratio of (b) 0:4, (c) 1:2, (d) 1:1, (e) 2:1 and (f) 3:1 (from Shen 
et al. 2020). 
196 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications semiconductor particles. Researchers have explored the photocatalytic performance 
of a large number of semiconductor materials such as TiO2, ZnO, WO3, CdS, 
Fe2O3, SnO2, etc. (Chan et al. 2011; Mousa et al. 2021). Under sufficient light 
excitation, an electron can jump the bandgap (e.g., from the highest occupied en￾ergy band) (valence band, VB) to the lowest empty one (conduction band, CB) 
(Figure 7.10). This forms a hole-electron pair. After migration to the particle sur￾face, the electron, e
− can cause the reduction of an external species and the hole, 
h+ its oxidation. For example, in aqueous media, semiconducting photocatalysts 
tend to generate reactive oxygen species such as superoxide ion, hydroxyl radical, 
peroxides, and singlet oxygen, the surface reactions being:

Lignin in Energy Conversion 197 Oxidation: H2O + h+ H+ + OH
An efficient photocatalyst must have a narrow bandgap to absorb in the UV visible 
range and CB and VB levels compatible (Figure 7.10) with the redox potentials of 
the initiating couples (for instance, •OH
/H2O and 
O2/O2
• in aqueous solutions). 
A) Schematic representation of photocatalytic reaction in a semiconductor under 
light irradiation in aqueous media. B) VB, CB and Eg of several semiconductors. 
Semiconductors are often use for photocatalysis as nanoparticles. Their design 
and preparation are crucial to reach good performances for photocatalytic reactions. 
Unfortunately, these nanophotocatalysts have some shortcomings in the process of 
actual use, such (1) nanoparticles tend to agglomerate, resulting in fewer active 
sites; (2) photogenerated electron and hole pairs easily recombine, resulting in low 
photocatalytic efficiency; (3) only part of the solar spectrum can be absorbed, re￾sulting in low utilization of sunlight; (4) semiconductor materials are prone to 
photocorrosion, resulting in poor recycling poor performance. Carbon exists widely 
in nature in the form of monomers or compounds. It can be used in modified 
semiconductor photocatalysts because it is nontoxic and chemically and thermally 
stable. Carbon based materials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, graphite-like 
carbon, etc., can be used to combine with photocatalysts to prepare composite 
photocatalysts which can be a good solution to the above problems (H. Wang, 
Qiu, Zhong, et al. 2017). Carbon-based materials have high specific surface area, a 
large number of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms and π-conjugated structure, which 
make them have good electrical conductivity (Khan et al. 2018). Carbon materials 
can be used as carriers to prevent agglomeration of nanophotocatalysts and thus 
increase their catalytic active sites. It also acts as an acceptor or transport channel 
for photogenerated electrons, thus increasing the photocatalyst activity (Chen et al. 
2016). In addition, the electronic interactions between carbon and semiconductor 
materials form a “binary” structure, which helps to broaden the light absorption 
range of the photocatalyst. Moreover, the good adsorption property of carbon 
FIGURE 7.10 a) Schematic representation of photocatalytic reaction in a semi-conductor 
under light irradiation in aqueous media. b) VB, CB and Eg of several semi-conductor. 
198 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications materials can also play a role in enriching the reaction substrate. These can promote 
the improvement of photocatalyst performance and inhibit the photocorrosion 
phenomenon of the catalyst at the same time. All these features of carbon-based 
photocatalysts can well improve the problems of photocatalysts in practical appli￾cations and are widely concerned. 
7.4.1 PHOTOCATALYTIC DEGRADATION OF ORGANIC DYES 
Wei Liu et al. (W. Liu et al. 2021) used phosphorus acid-assisted hydrothermal 
method to prepare lignin-derived graphene quantum dots (P-LGQDs). The prepared 
P-LGQDs had excellent optical properties due to the doping of phosphorus ele￾ments into the carbon material by this pretreatment. The P-LGQDs/g-C3N4 het￾erojunction composites were then prepared by sonicating melamine and quantum 
dots in an aqueous solution for 1 hour (as shown in Figure 7.11). The prepared 
P-LGQDs/g-C3N4 composites exhibited outstanding photocatalytic performance 
for the degradation of methylene blue and 2-phenoxy-1-phenylethanol (94.6% and 
93.1%, respectively). This would be a novel approach to efficiently and greenly 
convert lignin, and achieve valorization and value-added applications of lignin. 
Furthermore, the application of lignin-derived carbon materials will allow for 
efficient and rapid photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes and the production 
of chemicals. 
Huan Wang et al. (H. Wang, Qiu, Zhong, et al. 2017) successfully fabricated a 
lignin-based carbon/ZnO nanocomposite by using lignin from paper waste streams 
through one-pot in-situ method and calcination (as shown in Figure 7.12). ZnO 
nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed on lignin-based carbon nanosheets during 
high-temperature calcination. The specific surface area of the prepared photo￾catalysts was much higher than that of pure ZnO by BET analysis. The prepared 
nanocomposite showed excellent photocatalytic effect on the degradation of methyl

composites (from W. Liu et al. 2021). 
Lignin in Energy Conversion 199 orange with a degradation rate of 98.9%. At the same time, the material retained 
excellent photocatalytic activity after multiple recycling, which could be explained 
by the photocatalytic electron transfer mechanism between ZnO and porous carbon. 
The same method was used by Huan Wang et al. (H. Wang, Qiu, Liu, et al. 2017) to 
prepare well-combined lignin-based carbon/ZnO hybrid composite by using alkali 
lignin as carbon source. Similarly, the prepared photocatalysts showed excellent 
catalytic performance for both methyl orange and rhodamine. This achieves a green 
and valuable application of lignin in paper waste streams, which is of great sig￾nificance for the sustainable use of renewable resources. Furthermore, it also ex￾pands the application of biomass matrix and metal-oxide nanocomposites materials 
in the field of photovoltaics and photocatalysis. 
Zhong Dai et al. (Dai et al. 2020) successfully synthesized TiO2@lignin 
based carbon nanofibers composite materials (TiO2@CFs) by electrostatic 
spinning and heat treatment technology (as shown in Figure 7.13). The TiO2 
nanoparticles were uniformly and stably dispersed and wrapped around the 
carbon fiber, as observed by scanning-electron microscopy. The hydrophobicity 
FIGURE 7.12 Schematic illustration of the synthesis pathway for lignin-based carbon/ZnO 
nanocomposites (from H. Wang, Qiu, Zhong, et al. 2017). 
FIGURE 7.13 The production processes of TiO2@CFs (from Dai et al. 2020). 
200 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications of TiO2 and the high electrical conductivity of carbon fiber provided higher light 
adsorption capacity and internal electron transfer pathways for the TiO2@CFs 
composites. The prepared TiO2@CFs composites could achieve 100% of the 
photocatalytic methylene blue degradation within 21 minutes, which was about 
three times higher than commercial TiO2 materials. This will have a profound 
impact on the development of the field of highly efficient photocatalytic 
materials. 
Yuxiao Cui et al. (Cui et al. 2021) prepared the carbonized spheres com￾posites of lignin-based carbon spheres (LCs) and graphitic carbon nitride 
(g-C3N4) through hydrothermal synthesis. The prepared lignin microcapsules 
from softwood Kraft lignin were hydrothermally carbonized to obtain lignin￾based carbon spheres. The LCs/g-C3N4 composite photocatalyst was obtained by 
co-calcination of urea and carbon spheres under nitrogen atmosphere. The hy￾droxyl groups in the structure of carbon spheres could adsorb urea on their 
surface by hydrothermal method to achieve nitrogen doping of the LCs/g-C3N4 
composites. The results indicated that the photocatalytic degradation rate of the 
LCs/g-C3N4 composites obtained by this method for rhodamine B was three 
times that of pure g-C3N4 powder. Feng Feng et al. (Feng et al. 2015) used 
aminated lignin as a carbon source and zinc carbonate precursors to synthesize 
ZnO nanoparticles by high temperature calcination method. The photocatalytic 
degradation of methyl orange by the prepared lignin-doped ZnO nanoparticles 
could reach 98% within 90 minutes. The lignin content and calcination tem￾perature had a significant effect on the structure and catalytic properties of the 
ZnO nanoparticles. Ting-Ting Miao et al. (Miao, Guo, et Pan 2013) generated 
three different structures of ZnO nanocomposites (nanoparticle-bar, nanomesh￾lamina, and quasi-nanosphere) by using sodium lignosulphonate as a carbon 
source. The hierarchical nanostructures and excellent crystalline properties of 
the prepared ZnO nanocomposites were observed. The tunable size of ZnO 
nanomicrocrystals (50–200 nm) was controlled by the amount of sodium lig￾nosulphonate added during the precipitation synthesis. The prepared nanomesh￾lamina structure ZnO nanocomposites had the highest photocatalytic degradation 
rate for methylene blue, reaching 100% within 1.5 hours. This was because the 
nanomesh structure had more pores and a larger specific surface area, thus 
providing more active sites for photocatalytic reactions. The economical and 
simple method of synthesizing ZnO nanocomposites not only efficiently use 
biomass, but also can treat industrial wastewater. 
The main three dyes used in the aforementioned studies have their structures 
detailed in Figure 7.14, and Table 7.3 gathers the results of their degradation. 
7.4.2 PHOTOCATALYTIC DEGRADATION OF ORGANIC DRUGS 
Lin-Fei et al. (Tian et al. 2018) prepared lignin-based Fe3O4/C/ZnO ternary com￾posite through one-pot method by using lignin amine as a template and cross￾linking agent. The prepared Fe3O4/C/ZnO composite had Fe3O4 nanoparticles as 
the core, carbon encapsulated on the periphery of Fe3O4, and then ZnO nano￾particles adsorbed on the surface of carbon. The catalytic performance of the 
Lignin in Energy Conversion 201 prepared Fe3O4/C/ZnO composites was assessed by photocatalytic degradation of 
antibacterial drugs norfloxacin. The prepared ternary composite achieved 94% 
catalytic degradation of the drug norfloxacin and maintained high catalytic activity 
after five cycles. The highly active Fe3O4/C/ZnO photocatalysts are extremely 
useful in water treatment and pollutant degradation. 
Binpeng et al. (B. Zhang, Yang, Qian, et al. 2020) synthesized the lignin-based 
hollow carbon (LHC)/ZnO composite with highly improving the photocatalytic 
activity and recyclability. The hollow carbon with opening structure was obtained 
by using enzymatic hydrolysis lignin as the carbon source through calcination and 
self-assembly method. The ZnO/LHC composite photocatalysts were prepared by 
homogeneous immobilization of ZnO nanoparticles on the surface and inside the 
hollow carbon through a solvothermal method. The photocatalytic performance

202 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications of ZnO/LHC composite was significantly improved compared to that of pure ZnO. 
The rates of photocatalysts for degradation of organic pollutant (ciprofloxacin) 
and hydrogen production by hydrolysis had been increased by 2.0 times and 
1.8 times, respectively. This was because rapid transfer and conversion of reactants 
could be achieved in hollow and open structures, which thus increased the active 
site and improved the reaction activity. In addition, more light was absorbed to 
catalyze the reaction due to the electron interaction between ZnO and hollow 
carbon. The same method was used by Binpeng et al. (B. Zhang, Yang, Qiu, et al. 
2020) to prepare lignin-derived flower-like carbon (LFC)/ZnO composite. The ZnO 
nanoparticles could be stably embedded in flower-like carbon due to its three￾dimensional structure and large number of functional groups. The LFC/ZnO 
composite exhibited excellent photocatalytic performance for the degradation of 
sulfamethazine, with a degradation rate three times higher than that of pure ZnO. 
This not only achieves a simple and efficient application of lignin, but also solves 
the problem of recyclability of zinc oxide photocatalysts. 
Tao Wang et al. (T. Wang et al. 2020) produced the porous BiVO4-C nano￾composite by using sodium lignosulfonate as a carbon source through one-step 
hydrothermal method. The biomass-based porous structure formed by the carbo￾nization of lignin provided a good environment and attachment point for the 
uniform growth of BiVO4. The enhancing photocatalytic activity of BiVO4-C na￾nocomposite toward pollutant (oxytetracycline hydrochloride) under visible-light 
was observed. Compared with pure BiVO4, the photocatalytic degradation rate 
of BiVO4-C nanocomposite was increased by four times. This was mainly due to 
the involvement of oxygen-containing radicals in the porous carbon structure in the 
photocatalytic reaction process, leading to an increase in the charge-migration 
rate and thus an enhanced photocatalytic effect. 
The synthesis and application of lignin-controlled photocatalysts are important 
for the value-added effect of biomass resources. Xiaoyun et al. (Chen et al. 2016) 
prepared mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle by using un-modified lignin as a template 
through a hydrolysis precipitation approach. The specific surface area and pore 
volume of the prepared mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle reached 165.8 m2
/g 
and 0.312 cm3
/g, respectively, under high calcination temperature at 500 ℃. 
The photodegradation rate of phenol in aqueous solution up to 97.9% was ob￾served due to the network structure of lignin, which facilitated the stable for￾mation of mesoporous TiO2 nanoparticle. The electronegative hydroxyl 
functional group in the lignin structure had a strong affinity for metal ions, thus 
adsorbing the TiO2 nanoparticles to the template. Lignin from the black liquor 
waste is used as a template for preparing nanocomposites to realize the sustain￾able use of biological resources. 
Kirankumar et al. (Venkatesan Savunthari et al. 2021) developed lignin na￾norods/C3N4 nanocomposite materials by the wet-impregnation method for pho￾tocatalytic decomposition of drugs triclosan. The lignin nanorods were prepared 
from alkali lignin by using the solution combustion method in the muffle furnace. 
The graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) nanosheets and nanorods were prepared from 
melamine by a direct heating process and thermal reflow technology. The lignin 
nanorods/GCN nanocomposites were prepared through ultrasonic treatment and 
Lignin in Energy Conversion 203 suspension back method. Compared with other photocatalysts, the photocatalytic 
degradation rate of the prepared lignin/GCN nanocomposites for triclosan could be 
as high as 99.9%. The synergistic catalytic effect of lignin nanorods and GCN 
made the prepared nanocomposites have more active sites, which could improve the 
photocatalytic performance. This green and simple synthesis method allows for 
the efficient use of biological resources. Furthermore, the environmentally friendly 
and recyclable photocatalyst nanocomposites facilitate the treatment of organic 
pollutants in wastewater and environmental protection. 
Gómez-Avilés et al. (Gómez-Avilés et al. 2019) generated C-modified TiO2 
composites by using lignin as a carbon source through hydrothermal synthesis 
method and subsequent heat treatment. TiO2 was synthesized from titanium 
isopropoxide by using the sol-gel approach. The lignin and the synthesized TiO2 
were subsequently calcined at high temperature to obtain the C-modified TiO2 
composites. The anatase phase in C-modified TiO2 composites obtained after heat 
treatment had higher specific surface area and more defects. The results indicated 
that the prepared C-modified TiO2 composites had a high catalytic effect on 
the solar-photocatalytic degradation of acetaminophen and maintained good 
stability after four uses. It was attributed to the enhanced light absorption of the 
C-modified TiO2 composites, which improved the photocatalytic activity. The 
development of photocatalysts has a very important role in the photodegradation 
of emerging pollutants. 
Table 7.4 sums up those degradation tests by composite catalysts of various 
drugs, whose structures are given in Figure 7.15.

204 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 7.4.3 PHOTOCATALYTIC DEGRADATION OF SO2 AND CO2 GAS 
Nan Wang et al. (N. Wang, Fan, et Ai 2015) prepared porous carbon-CeO2 com￾posites by using sodium lignin sulfonate as a carbon source through co-calcination 
process under 400 ℃ to 600 ℃. The decomposition of lignin at high temperatures 
leaded to the formation of porous carbon, which provided a template for the 
homogeneous growth of CeO2 nanorods. The porous carbon-CeO2 composites 
could be obtained from the uniform growth of CeO2 nanorods in the porous carbon 
structure. The prepared composites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic desulphura￾tion effects at room temperature under light conditions. Compared with CeO2 na￾norods, the photocatalytic conversion rate of the porous carbon-CeO2 composites 
for SO2 was significantly improved, up to 51.98%. This was due to the porous 
structure of carbon that could absorb more SO2, thus increasing the photocatalytic 
reaction activity and conversion rate. The prepared photocatalyst significantly af￾fected the removal of SO2 from the environment, which not only develops the 
potential application of lignin, but also reduces the environmental pollution pro￾blem. Qichao Gao et al. (Gao et al. 2021) successfully synthesized lignin-based 
carbon quantum dots (C dots) and TiO2 nanosheets composites by the thermal 
desorption method. The lignin in poplar pre-hydrolysis liquor was purified and 
extracted by adsorption of TiO2 nanosheets, and then the mixture sample was 
calcined at 500 ℃ for 3 hours to obtain the C/TiO2 composite. Under the action of 
high temperature, the formed lignin-based carbon quantum dots were uniformly 
fixed and dispersed on TiO2 nanosheets. The synthesized C/TiO2 composites were 
used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction to evaluate their catalytic performance (Gao 
et al. 2021). The results showed that the photocatalytic capacity of C/TiO2 com￾posites for CO2 reduction was enhanced by 300% compared with pure TiO2 na￾nosheets. The efficient reduction of CO2 by the prepared C/TiO2 photocatalyst will 
play an important role in environmental protection and suppression of the green￾house effect. (Figure 7.16). 
The synthesis of the carbon-based material with the photocatalyst imparts ex￾cellent photocatalytic performance and good stability to the photocatalyst. 
Therefore, carbon-based photocatalysts are well suited for the removal of toxic 
organic compounds in wastewater by photocatalytic degradation. The use of solar 
FIGURE 7.15 Examples of drugs treated by photocatalysts. 
Lignin in Energy Conversion 205 energy to treat pollutants in water has broad practical application prospects due to 
its nontoxic and low energy consumption, which has received wide attention from 
researchers. 
7.5 CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES 
With the rapid development of industry, the problem of resource shortage and 
environmental pollution has gradually aroused widespread concern. Many re￾searchers are beginning to shift their attention from nonrenewable fossil resources 
to renewable and abundant biomass resources. Energy is an important and essential 
material prerequisite for economic development and social life. Solving the problem 
of efficient energy conversion is an indispensable means to achieve sustainable 
socio-economic development. Biomass, such as lignin, cellulose, etc., is renewable, 
widely distributed, and abundant, which can ensure their sustainable use for the 
production of energy. Therefore, realizing the high-value utilization of lignin bio￾mass energy is of great significance to alleviating the current resource shortage 
problem. 
As an industrial by-product, industrial lignin has low economic efficiency as a 
fuel and also causes serious environmental problems. Based on the structural 
characteristics and functions of lignin itself, the preparation of value-added products 
from industrial lignin as a raw material can realize its potential high-value appli￾cations. Lignin-based nanomaterials prepared by using abundant lignin as a carbon 
source have good light transmission as well as excellent mass-transfer efficiency 
and electron-transport properties. Therefore, their unique physicochemical proper￾ties have attracted extensive interest from researchers in the fields of photocatalysis, 
adsorption, and energy storage. 
FIGURE 7.16 Process scheme of the photocatalytic CO2 reduction with C/TiO2 photo￾catalyst (from Gao et al. 2021). 
206 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications Lignin contains a large number of aromatic ring skeletons, as well as active 
functional groups that can be used to prepare carbon-based nanomaterials with 
high specific surface area. They are suitable as carriers for noble metal catalysts. The 
prepared photocatalysts can quickly remove pollutants from industrial wastewater, 
which is simple, efficient, environmentally friendly, and easy to operate. Meanwhile, 
the nanocomposites synthesized from lignin can provide sustainable solutions for 
energy conversion such as solar cells and fuel cells. More importantly, they also have 
great potential high-value applications in other fields such as food packaging, bio￾medicine, cosmetics, and drug delivery. In conclusion, we need to invest more efforts 
to develop value-added applications of biomass energy represented by lignin as much 
as possible to achieve efficient conversion and sustainable use of energy.

8.1 INTRODUCTION 
Rapid technological advancements and innovations bring revolutionary changes 
to our society but raise major environmental crises and energy-conservation issues. 
Traditional fossil fuel creates severe environmental crises, such as water pollution, 
air pollution, global warming, and rising sea levels. Therefore, fossil-energy re￾sources must be replaced with renewable and sustainable energy-storage devices. 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003245261-10 215 Electrochemical energy-storage systems, such as supercapacitors, batteries, and 
fuel cells, have shown great potential for powering portable electronic devices, smart￾grids, and electric vehicles. The major challenge in developing these energy-storage 
devices is reducing the overall cost and using environmentally friendly materials and 
processes. Among the various materials, cellulose-derived materials have gained the 
attention of researchers as natural, eco-friendly, and biodegradable materials 
(Pradhan, Brooks, and Yadavalli 2020; R. Guo et al. 2020; Subhedar et al. 2021). 
Cellulose, the most abundant natural biopolymer substance, is produced by 
plants, tunicates, algae, and bacteria (Moon et al. 2011) derived from wool, cotton, 
flax, sisal, and hemp plants. It can be used as a polymer substitute due to its 
lightweight, biocompatibility, renewability, biodegradability, versatility, natural 
abundance, and excellent adaptability (Lasrado, Ahankari, and Kar 2020; Khalid 
et al. 2021). Furthermore, because of its nontoxic and environmentally benign 
nature, it has increasingly been used as a sustainable material in various emerging 
fields like drug delivery, energy storage, biomedicine, electronics, structural en￾gineering, and automotive applications (Xing et al. 2019; Nagarajan et al. 2021). 
According to an IMARC Group report, the cellulose fibres market is valued 
29.3 billion USD in 2019 and is expected to grow to 49.2 billion USD by 2026, at a 
CAGR of 9% (IMARC Group Report 2021). Nanocellulose (NC) is cellulose with 
length in the nanometer scale (<100 nm) and is mainly classified into three types: 
cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), cellulose nanofibers (CNF), and bacterial cellulose 
(BC). Table 8.1 compares physicochemical properties associated with CNCs, 
CNFs, and BC. 
Cellulose is made up of linear chains of β-D-glucan units joined by β-1, 4 
glycosidic bonds with cellobiose residues as the repeating unit at different degrees 
of polymerization. The intramolecular hydrogen bonds and intermolecular van der 
Waals forces promote the parallel stacking of chains, resulting in an abundance of 
nanosized elementary fibrils bundled together to form microfibrils, which in turn 
develop macro-fibrils (Moon et al. 2011; Gopi et al. 2019; Pang et al. 2021). 
Figure 8.1 shows a pictorial representation of cellulose from its natural raw material 
to the fundamental molecule (Miyashiro, Hamano, and Umemura 2020). CNF is a 
bunch of cellulose nanofibers, as shown in Figure 8.1a. The intertwined cellulose 
chains are flexible and have a large surface area. CNF comprises crystalline and 
amorphous regions with widths ranging from tens to hundreds of nanometers and 
soft and long chains with micrometer scale lengths (see Table 8.1). As shown in 
Figure 8.1b, CNC resembles an extended crystal rod and is more rigid than CNF. 
BC is synthesized through microbial fermentation (see Figure 8.1c). Other bacterial 
species that produce BC include agrobacterium, pseudomonas, rhizobium, and 
sarcina (Siró and Plackett 2010). 
Several techniques have been developed for extracting NC from cellulosic ma￾terials. The types and properties of the produced NC vary depending on the ex￾traction technique employed (Phanthong et al. 2018). Figure 8.2 and 8.3 depicts 
the three main NC extraction techniques: chemical, enzymatic hydrolysis, and 
mechanical processing (Rojas, Bedoya, and Ciro 2015).

Nanocellulose-Based Supercapacitor Electrodes 217 8.2 PREPARATION OF NC-BASED CONDUCTIVE MATERIALS 
FOR ENERGY-STORAGE DEVICES 
Conductive materials allow electrical current to flow, and, as a result, they are essential in 
energy-storage devices. Many conductive materials, e.g., conducting polymers (CPs), 
carbonaceous materials (like graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNT), carbon black), and 
metallic particles, are generally combined with a soft and flexible substrate to form 
lightweight electrodes for supercapacitors. NC-based porous materials have unique 
features that enable them to be widely used as electrodes or substrates in energy-storage 
devices, particularly supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries (Li, Yu, et al. 2017; Wang, 
Yu, et al. 2019). Since NC is not electrically conductive, it must be functionalized with 
conductive materials before being used as electrode material in energy-storage devices. 
Fabrication of NC-based conductive materials is usually performed in two ways, as 
shown in Figure 8.4. The first is to coat conductive materials on top of the NC substrate. 
The second is to combine conductive materials within the NC substrate, mainly by in￾situ polymerization and blending (Hsu and Zhong 2019; R. Guo et al. 2020). 
8.3 NC-BASED MATERIALS FOR ELECTRODES IN 
SUPERCAPACITOR 
Supercapacitors are the most promising electrochemical energy-storage devices 
exhibiting high specific power density (10 kW kg−1), specific energy density 
FIGURE 8.1 a) Cellulose in plants or trees has a hierarchical structure that ranges from the 
meter to the nanometer scale, b) This schematic illustration shows the reaction between 
cellulose and acid to form nanocellulose, and c) Bionanocellulose is cultivated from 
cellulose-synthesizing bacteria ( Miyashiro, Hamano, and Umemura 2020). 
218 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications (10 Wh kg−1), superior rate capability, fast charge-discharge rate, long cycle life 
(>105 cycles), and low maintenance cost (Cao et al. 2018; Huang et al. 2018; Xu 
et al. 2018). In short, its electrochemical performance lies in between electro￾chemical batteries and capacitors (Pérez-Madrigal, Edo, and Alemán 2016). 
Supercapacitors are mainly classified into three categories based on the charge 
storage mechanism: 1) electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), 2) pseudoca￾pacitors, and 3) hybrid supercapacitors (see Figure 8.5). EDLC stores energy by

2015).

Zhong 2019). 
220 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications accumulating charges electrostatically at the electrode/electrolyte interface, whereas 
pseudocapacitors utilize fast and reversible redox reactions on the electrode ma￾terials to obtain high pseudocapacitance. Hybrid supercapacitors combine both 
EDLC and pseudocapacitive mechanisms using both types of electrodes (W. Chen 
et al. 2018). The capacitance of supercapacitors is mainly dependent on electro￾chemical adsorption/desorption of anions and cations at the electrode/electrolyte 
interface. Higher capacitance can be achieved by increasing the electrode’s surface 
area and pore volume, providing more space for electrolyte ion adsorption (R. Guo 
et al. 2020). 
NC can be combined with other active materials or transformed into carbon 
materials to develop highly porous aerogels and films with high mechanical 
strength, high surface area, and excellent electrochemical performance (Jose et al. 
2019). Furthermore, NC-based functional materials have been utilized to fabricate 
the elements of supercapacitor devices, such as electrodes, separators, and gel 
electrolytes (L. Li et al. 2018; Peng et al. 2018). This chapter focuses on the recent 
advancements in supercapacitor electrodes made from NC-based materials. Work 
done by several researchers related to the fabrication of NC-based aerogel and films 
for supercapacitor electrode applications is reviewed and discussed in the sub￾sequent sections. Table 8.3 summarizes the electrochemical performance of various 
NC-based supercapacitors. 
8.3.1 NC–CPS BASED MATERIALS 
CPs are organic polymers with highly conjugated polymeric chains that conduct 
electricity. Among all kinds of CPs, polyaniline (PANI, 0.01–5 S cm−1), poly￾pyrrole (PPy, 0.3–100 S cm−1), polythiophene (PTh, 2–150 S cm−1), polyacetylene 
(PA, 3–1000 S cm−1), and their derivatives have been extensively explored as active 
electrode materials owing to their fast redox switching, high pseudocapacitance, 
good electrical conductivity, and low cost (Nyholm et al. 2011; Shi et al. 2015; 
Shown et al. 2015). In recent years, significant research has been carried out to 
FIGURE 8.5 Type and mechanism of supercapacitors: electrical double-layer capacitors, 
pseudocapacitor and hybrid ( Pal et al. 2019). 
Nanocellulose-Based Supercapacitor Electrodes 221 develop conductive composite films and aerogels by combining CPs (particularly 
PANI and PPy) with NC. PPy and PANI are easy to synthesize and inexpensive. 
These materials exhibit higher specific mass capacitances, and power density and 
hence are widely used as electrode materials for supercapacitors (Meng et al. 2017; 
W. Zheng et al. 2017). 
PANI has attractive properties, such as low density, excellent doping/ 
dedoping characteristics, large storage capacity, and redox reversibility (Ramya, 
Sivasubramanian, and Sangaranarayanan 2013). However, it has major drawbacks 
such as low conductivity and insolubility (difficult to melt), making it and its de￾rivatives challenging to process (Bhadra et al. 2009). As a result of these limita￾tions, PANI-based materials are usually combined with carbon-based materials for 
supercapacitor applications. The various composite materials developed employing 
PANI, NC, and carbon-based materials and their performance are discussed in 
Section 8.3.3. The development and electrochemical performance of the PPy-NC 
based materials are discussed in the following section. 
8.3.1.1 Films 
Two-dimensional film electrodes, consisting of a layer of active material with a 
thickness ranging from nanometers to a few micrometers, have been intensively 
studied in supercapacitors, particularly flexible/stretchable supercapacitors and 
micro-supercapacitors. Notable attempts have been made to develop paper-based 
flexible electroactive conducting polymers composite supercapacitor electrodes 
with enhanced capacitance. PPy has received much attention in developing flexible 
supercapacitor electrodes for portable and wearable electronics (L. Wang et al. 
2019). Wang et al. (Z. Wang, Carlsson, et al. 2015) demonstrated a surface modified 
PPy-NC composite with a high gravimetric and volumetric capacitance of 127 F g−1 
and 122 F cm−3, respectively, at a current density of 300 mA cm−2. The device 
provided energy and power densities of 3.1 mWh cm−3 and 3 W cm−3. 
On the other hand, the use of PPy resulted in poor processability and mechanical 
properties, which limits its commercial applications. This can be prevented by 
forcible reinforcement of matrix with natural fibres like algae or BC (C. Ding et al. 
2010; Sasso et al. 2010; Cabuk et al. 2014; Nazarzadeh Zare, Mansour Lakouraj, 
and Mohseni 2014). Bideau et al. (Bideau et al. 2016) synthesized conductive 
composite films with oxidized cellulosic nanofibers (CNFo), 1-(2-cyanoethyl) 
pyrrole, and pyrrole, and reduced 1-(2-cyanoethyl)pyrrole before grafting it on 
the carboxyl groups of CNFo. On this grafted material, the polymerization of 
PPy has conducted in an iron (III) chloride (FeCl3) solution. The grafting of 
1-(2-cyanoethyl)pyrrole to the material improved its properties by strengthening 
the bond between the polymer chains and the cellulose fibers. Also, the PPy de￾position on the grafted material increased mechanical properties, wettability, 
electrical conductivity, and thermal protection. The electrical conductivity was 
increased by a factor of 105 compared to the film without PPy coating. 
Wesling et al. (Wesling et al. 2020) prepared supercapacitor devices using BC￾based separator and flexible electrodes and provided enough support and high 
surface area. The electrodes comprised BC membranes with PPy at different con￾centrations of copper chloride (CuCl2), used as an oxidizing agent. It was observed 
222 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications that increasing the ratio of CuCl2 to PPy concentration resulted in a spike in specific 
capacitance from an average value of 82 mF cm−2 for [0.04 M] 2:1 sample to 
1649 mF cm−2 for [0.08 M] 4:1 sample. The device exhibited a maximum specific 
capacitance of 1789 mF cm−2, energy density of 6.05 × 10−6 Wh cm−2, and power 
density of 2.44 × 10−3 W cm−2. During discharge testing at 1 mA cm−2, it obtained 
significant energy density and power density of 187 Wh cm−2 and 5.47 mW cm−2, 
respectively, making it a viable candidate for future energy-storage devices. 
Many supercapacitor electrodes show high gravimetric capacitance but lack high 
volumetric capacities due to low actual mass loadings and apparent densities for the 
active material. Due to the growing demand for portable and wearable energy￾storage devices, developing three-dimensional (3D) electrodes with high volumetric 
capacitance is necessary to maximize device volume utilization. 
8.3.1.2 Aerogels 
Aerogel is a fascinating 3D nanoporous material with excellent physical and che￾mical properties, ultra-low density (0.003–0.5 g cm−3), high porosity (95%–99.8%), 
large specific surface area (SSA) (100–1500 m2 g−1) (Long, Weng, and Wang 2018). 
Nanoporous aerogels have been extensively used for various fields such as food 
applications, energy storage, optical sensors, adsorption, defense and aerospace, 
and water purification (Hebalkar et al. 2020; Manzocco, Mikkonen, and García￾González 2021). Aerogels have a wide range of functions such as open networks, 
high surface area, bandgap, and nanosized features (Ziegler et al. 2017). Chen et al. 
(Y. Chen et al. 2018) prepared highly conductive electrode material by in-situ 
polymerization of PPy on CNFs and vapour-grown carbon fibres (VGCFs). The 
material’s conductivity was found to increase as the VGCF content increased. 
CNF/VGCF/PPy aerogel exhibited capacitance of 8.61 F cm−2 (678.66 F g−1), and 
after 2000 cycles of charge/discharge, 91.38% of capacitance was retained. 
Aerogel templating is a straightforward approach for developing highly porous 
and organized structures (Smirnova and Gurikov 2017). Nguyen et al. (Nguyen, 
Hamad, and MacLachlan 2018) developed PPy composite aerogel fibers templated 
by gelatin-functionalized cellulose nanocrystals (gCNC) aerogel fibers see 
Figure 8.6a). They employed gCNC aerogel fibres with hierarchical (HCF) and 
twisted structures (TCF). The gelatin plays a crucial role in crosslinking CNCs and 
introduces surface functional groups to assist the complete deposition of PPy on the 
CNC nanofibrillar aerogels. The PPy/HCF composites exhibit a web-like hier￾archical aerogel network under TEM (see Figure 8.6c). In contrast, the PPy/TCF 
composites retain the CNC scaffolds’ chiral nematic structure (see Figure 8.6d). 
Supercapacitor electrodes made of PPy composites exhibit a leaf-like cyclic vol￾tammetry (CV) curve at a slow scan rate of 5 mV s
−1 (see Figure 8.6b), whereas 
PPy/HCF and PPy/TCF exhibit specific capacitance of 60 F g−1. The high porosity 
and chirality of the developed gCNC aerogels make them promising in fibril pro￾cessing, biomedical engineering, scaffolding, absorption, and chiral separations 
(De France, Hoare, and Cranston 2017; H. Liu et al. 2017). 
Cell capacitance can be enhanced by using electrode materials with electro￾chemically active groups, which causes an enhanced charge storage corre￾sponding with charge/discharge of the double-layer (Karlsson et al. 2013; 2014; 
Nanocellulose-Based Supercapacitor Electrodes 223 Z. Wang et al. 2014). Tammela et al. (Tammela et al. 2015) obtained a capaci￾tance of 11 F g−1 for the asymmetric devices at a current density of 156 mA cm−2, 
while cyclic stability indicates a loss of 23% capacity over 1000 cycles at a 
current density of 20 mA cm−2. They used polypyrrole-covered cladophora cel￾lulose composite fibres (PPy-cellulose) as a positive electrode. Carbon nanofibers 
formed by heat treatment of the developed PPy-cellulose composite in the pre￾sence of nitrogen gas were used as a negative electrode. A cell capacitance value 
of 25 F g−1 was found for an asymmetric cell operating at 1.6 V, equating to a 
gravimetric energy density of 33 J g−1, which is much higher than that reported 
for symmetric PPy-cellulose supercapacitors (14 J g−1). The carbon and PPy￾cellulose electrodes exhibited specific gravimetric capacitances of around 59 
and 146 F g−1. 
Even though CPs have several advantages, such as simple synthesis procedure, 
high pseudocapacitance, and flexibility, they have the drawback of having low 
energy density and power density, as well as poor cyclic stability. Researchers have 
recently developed ternary composites combining CPs, carbon materials, and metal 
oxides, and the supercapacitors displayed improved electrochemical performance. 
The supercapacitor developed using ternary composites, and their performances are 
discussed in section 9.3.3. 
8.3.2 NC–CARBON-BASED MATERIALS 
8.3.2.1 Films 
Many recent studies have proposed to produce NC-graphene based film-type 
electrodes. The composite thin film can be prepared by either vacuum filtration or 
FIGURE 8.6 a) A polymerization mechanism of pyrrole on gCNC fibers, b) Cyclic vol￾tammetry curves of PPy/TCF fibers and PPy/HCF fiber electrodes in 0.01 M KCl solution at

TCF composites ( Nguyen, Hamad, and MacLachlan 2018). 
224 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications chemical vapour deposition (Weng et al. 2011; L. Liu et al. 2014; Y. Liu et al. 2015; 
R. Liu, Ma, Huang, Mei, Li, et al. 2016). Song et al. synthesized the graphene-oxide 
(GO)/NC films by chemical reduction and layer by layer deposition on flexible NC 
substrate, which was different from the traditional method (N. Song et al. 2017). 
Sevilla et al. (Sevilla, Ferrero, and Fuertes 2016) prepared a flexible film com￾posite with excellent ion diffusion. The porous cellulose was deposited onto porous 
particles to generate the composite film, which enabled direct access to the elec￾trolyte and provided an excellent electrochemical performance. It showed an areal 
capacitance of 60 mF cm−2 at a current density of 500 mA cm−2 and 95% capa￾citance retention after 5000 cycles. Li et al. (Z. Li et al. 2017) used the structural 
advantages of CNF and CNC to develop the hybrid NC films as a material for 
supercapacitor electrodes. Long CNF established a macroporous framework, and 
the assembly of short CNC around the CNF framework resulted in the formation of 
micro/mesopores. The carbonized thin film with a hierarchal porous structure 
formed due to strong interaction between the CNFs and CNCs exhibited SSA of 
1244 m2 g−1. With a high mass loading of 4 mg cm−2, hierarchically porous carbon 
film exhibited a specific capacitance of 170 F g−1 and retained 65% of its original 
specific capacitance at a very high current of 50 A g−1. 
8.3.2.2 Aerogels 
Carbon aerogels are enticing for supercapacitors owing to their fascinating char￾acteristics like high SSA, highly porous structure, excellent electrical conductivity, 
low density, and open 3D network (Biener et al. 2011; Antonietti, Fechler, and 
Fellinger 2014). Carbon aerogels obtained from precursors such as melamine/for￾maldehyde (MF) (Yang et al. 2021), resorcinol/formaldehyde (RF) (Yu, Sano, and 
Zheng 2022), and cresol/formaldehyde (Zhu et al. 2006) exhibit relatively high SSA 
and specific capacitances, but also harmful, costly precursors and complex synthesis 
processes hinder large-scale production. 
Cellulose-based carbon aerogels have gained interest due to biodegradability and 
renewability, as cellulose is a natural and easily accessible polymer, making it a 
promising material for realistic applications (Wu et al. 2013; Jiang and Hsieh 2014). 
Cellulose aerogels can be synthesized through gelation, regeneration, and super￾critical or freeze-drying (Zu et al. 2016; Zaman et al. 2020). The performance of 
carbon aerogels obtained for different carbon aerogels is presented in Table 8.2. Zu 
et al. (Zu et al. 2016) used natural materials as precursors and synthesized CO2- 
activated high SSA carbon aerogels by pyrolyzing NC aerogels. They reported an 
increase in the SSA (892 to 1873 m2 g−1) after CO2 activation. The activated carbon 
aerogels exhibited higher specific capacitances (302 F g−1) than inactivated carbon 
aerogels (187 F g−1) because the large SSA and highly porous interconnected na￾nostructure allowed electrolyte ions and electrons to migrate efficiently. 
Carbon aerogels obtained from BC are flexible, fire-retardant, and have a higher 
potential for organic pollutants/oils absorption. Also, BC–derived materials are 
under a fast–developing stage and are extensively used in biomedical applications, 
paper-making, and energy-storage devices (Ma et al. 2020). Recently, Lv et al. (Yan 
Lv et al. 2020) have synthesized coal-based porous carbon aerogels using freeze￾drying and subsequent calcination. The coal oxide was used as a carbon source, 
Nanocellulose-Based Supercapacitor Electrodes 225 while polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) served as a crosslinking agent and sacrificial tem￾plate. Figure 8.7a) depicts the steps involved in developing 3D hierarchical porous 
carbon aerogels. The supercapacitor electrode exhibited a high specific capacitance 
of 260 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 with excellent retention of 105% after 
50,000 cycles. The aerogel’s excellent electrochemical performance was due to its 
3D crosslinked structure, high SSA (1303 m2 g−1), 3D hierarchical porous structure, 
and 65.6% micropore to total volume ratio. 
Zhuo et al. (Zhuo et al. 2019) developed a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical 
porous carbon aerogel to support conductive PPy using cellulose as a carbon precursor. 
PPy was loaded to the surface of a carbonized cellulose framework homogeneously 
(see Figure 8.7b). The aerogel’s layered porous structure enhanced the ion transport and 
electrochemical performance. The supercapacitor with carbon/PPy aerogel electrode 
demonstrated a high specific capacitance of 387.6 F g−1 with excellent cyclic retention. 
Reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is a nanostructured carbonaceous material with 
excellent conductivity and has been widely employed for supercapacitor electrodes. 
Wang et al. (T. Wang et al. 2020) developed bamboo-derived cellulose fibers/ 
RGO carbon aerogel composite by freeze-drying and carbonization. With 2.5 wt% 
of GO, the composite revealed hierarchical pore structures (in the range of 0.5–2.0 
nm), resulting in a high SSA of 1957 m2 g−1. Also, a high specific capacitance of 
351 F g−1 at 10 mV s
−1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte solution was observed. The composite 
showed low internal and charge-transfer resistance, indicating excellent electrochemical 
behavior. 
8.3.3 NC/CP/GRAPHENE/METALLIC PARTICLES-BASED COMPOSITE 
MATERIALS 
Doping or coating with conductive polymers such as PPy or PANI improves the 
electrochemical property of supercapacitor because it has a high pseudocapacitance, 
is environmentally friendly, economic, and involves a simple synthetic procedure 
(D. Wang et al. 2018; Choudhary, Ansari, and Purty 2020; Luo et al. 2020; X. Liu 
et al. 2020). Employing ice crystal templates followed by CO2 activation, Lei et al. 
FIGURE 8.7 The synthesis process for a) 3D hierarchical porous carbon aerogels (Yan Lv 
et al. 2020) and b) 3D hierarchical porous carbon/PPy aerogel composite ( Zhuo et al. 2019). 
226 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications (Lei et al. 2021) developed an N-doped cellulose-based carbon aerogel with an 
interconnected honeycomb-like percolation structure using PPy as a nitrogen 
source. The SSA (31–1196 m2 g−1) and total pore volume (0.02–0.58 cm3 g−1) 
increased as the CO2 activation period was increased from 0.5 to 2 hours. The 
specific capacitance was also found to increase with the CO2 activation period, as 
illustrated in Figure 8.8a. The supercapacitor with 2 hours CO2 activation period 
aerogel (N-CA-2) electrode displayed high specific capacitance of 160 F g−1, out￾standing charge/discharge rates and remarkable cyclic stability (98.2% retention 
after 3000 cycles). Furthermore, the device achieved specific energy of 21.9 Wh 
kg−1 at specific power of 145 W kg−1 using EMIMBF4 electrolyte. Shang et al. 
(Shang et al. 2021), on the other hand, produced a zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 
(ZIF-8) derived carbon (ZC)/ PANI@CA (ZPCA) composite with a high SSA of 
347 m2 g−1 and a high N- content (6.27 at.%). A 3D hierarchical framework of 
ZPCA revealed micropore (0.89 nm) and widened meso/macropores (10–80 nm). 
Shorter ion-diffusion paths result from a well-developed hierarchical porous 
structure, favouring electrochemical performance enhancement. At 0.5 A g−1, the 
ZPCA electrode had a high specific capacitance of 388 F g−1 and good cyclic 
stability at a high current density (see Figure 8.8b). The ZPCA symmetric super￾capacitor in 1 M Et4NBF4/AN electrolyte demonstrated an exceptionally high en￾ergy density of 81.8 Wh kg−1 at a power density of 950 W kg−1.

228 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications CNF has been used in many applications like biosensors and energy-storage 
devices because of its high structural stability, mechanical strength, and low thermal 
expansion (Jiang et al. 2018; W. Chen et al. 2018). CNF is hydrophilic and hence 
promotes ion diffusion within the graphene layers and increases the hybrid elec￾trode’s flexibility and mechanical strength. Also, due to more hydroxyl groups, 
CNF bonds firmly with PPy (Du et al. 2017; Z. Wang et al. 2017; W. Chen et al. 
2018). CNF is combined with PANI to create a material capable of producing high￾performance supercapacitors. The presence of CNF with PANI during poly￾merization improves specific capacitance. The composite with 20 wt% CNF had the 
highest capacitance of 421.5 F g−1 (W. Zheng et al. 2017). 
Lyu et al. (Lyu et al. 2019) used CNF aerogels with an electrochemically active 
nanoscale fibre-entangled network of PANI, multiwalled carbon nanotubes 
(CMWCNTs), and GO nanosheets to fabricate hierarchically structured 
polymer–inorganic hybrid nanocomposite electrodes employing layer-by-layer as￾sembly process (see Figure 8.8c and d). The material delivered a high SSA, large 
effective contact area, and high areal capacitance (see Figure 8.8e) of the electrode. 
CNF-[PANI/CMWCNT]10 (CPC10) and CNF-[PANI/RGO]10 (CPR10) showed ca￾pacitance of 965.80 and 780.64 F g−1 in 1 M aqueous H2SO4 (see Figure 8.8f). 
Recently, Hou et al. (Hou et al. 2020) developed a conductive CNF/CNT film 
utilizing a vacuum-filtration method. The film was then used to electrodeposit 
a PPy/CNT composite to develop a sandwich structured film supercapacitor. 
The CNF assisted in the homogenous dispersion of CNT to produce the conductive 
CNT/NFC film and increased the mechanical strength of the film. With 19.2 wt% 
CNT, the developed film had a high tensile strength of 60.8 MPa and electrical 
conductivity of 90.8 8 S cm−1. The flexible supercapacitor had a capacitance of 
11.25 F cm−3 and a volumetric energy density of 1 mWh cm−3 at a power density of 
0.08 W cm−3. 
RGO can be used with PANI to improve the mechanical and electrochemical 
properties of the electrodes (C. Liu et al. 2010; Manoj et al. 2017). As there is an 
extensive demand for eco-friendly, lightweight, and high-performance super￾capacitors, Hsu et al. (Hsu et al. 2019) developed a metal-less NC-based super￾capacitor with PANI/RGO film electrode exhibiting excellent flexibility, 
conductivity, mechanical strength, and high mass loading ratio of active mate￾rials. PANI/GO-based supercapacitors developed by Manoj et al. demonstrated 
high specific capacitance of 132 F g−1 at a current density of 5 A g−1. The su￾percapacitor cells displayed impressive cycling stability, retaining 84.8% of their 
initial capacity over 1000 cycles (Manoj et al. 2017). Kang et al. (Kang et al. 
2017) developed a GO/PANI-based composite electrode with an excellent elec￾trochemical performance by growing a network of PANI on the surface of GO 
and using it as a conductive link between the interlayers of GO. Liu et al. (R. Liu, 
Ma, Huang, Mei, Xu, et al. 2016) prepared a PANI/cellulose/graphene electro￾conductive and a highly flexible film by filtration method that can serve as an 
independent electrode. Its layered structure can provide capacitance of 2–5 times 
greater than most of the polymer flexible electrodes. When used as a symmetric 
capacitor, it gives an areal capacitance of 1.93 F cm−2 with an energy density of 
0.17 mWh cm−2. 
Nanocellulose-Based Supercapacitor Electrodes 229 Wan et al. (Wan, Jiao, and Li 2017) produced RGO/PPy/cellulose mixed-paper 
substrate by in-situ polymerization and chemical reduction treatment and used it as 
a supercapacitor electrode. It showed a capacitance of 1.2 F cm−2 at 2 mA cm−2 
with permittivity at 89.5% after 5000 cycles. The film fabricated using CNF, RGO, 
and PPy displayed a sandwich-like structure. The bulk PPy was wrapped in RGO/ 
CNF frame, resulting in a high flexibility supercapacitor electrode. The specific 
capacitance of the electrode was as high as 304 F g−1, and 81.8% capacitance 
was retained after 1000 charge/discharge cycles. The symmetric supercapacitor 
assembled using two paper electrodes exhibited a high specific capacitance of 
625.6 F g−1 and retained 75.4% of initial capacitance upon 5000 charge/discharge 
cycles (Hou et al. 2019). 
Chopped carbon fibre (CCF) can freely pierce through any part of the 3D net￾work of the cellulosic fibres, which improves the mechanical properties of the 
material and provides a pathway for electron transfer even if it is damaged. The 
addition of CCF on the PPy/GO electrode improved the electrochemical perfor￾mance and provided high charging/discharging rates (Razaq et al. 2012; Z. Wang, 
Xu, et al. 2015). Lyu et al. (Lyu et al. 2016) fabricated a paper-based supercapacitor 
via in-situ polymerization of PPy and RGO coated on CCF. The composite formed 
shows high flexibility and a high areal capacitance of 363 mF cm−2 with a volu￾metric energy density of 0.28 mWh cm−3 at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2. The 
capacitance is retained up to 84% even if the composite is severely damaged. 
The one-dimensional (1D) NC fibers can avoid the stacking of graphene na￾nosheets and agglomeration of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheet because of 
its high aspect ratio, mechanical property, and flexibility (Klemm et al. 2011; Moon 
et al. 2011; Yanyan Lv et al. 2017). Lv et al. (Yanyan Lv et al. 2019) developed 
a solid-state supercapacitor using nanohybrid aerogel films due to the high porosity. 
These films are made up of carbon-nanosphere fibers (CNPFs)/MoS2/RGO as 
electrode materials and PVA or sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as electrolyte. These nano￾hybrid aerogels were prepared by freeze-drying process and one-step pyrolysis. 
The all-solid-state flexible supercapacitors showed a high specific capacitance of 
1144.3 F g−1 at 2 mV s
−1 and high retention of capacitance (>98%) even after 
10,000 cycles. 
Zhang et al. (Zhang et al. 2019) demonstrated an all-nanofiber asymmetric su￾percapacitor with hierarchical porous carbon (HPC) anode, NC separator, and 
hierarchical porous HPC/nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4) composite cathode (see 
Figure 8.9a). During the formation of aerogel foam, the ZnCl2 used as a pore 
regulation agent resulted in high SSA and high porosity in both HPC and HPC/ 
NiCo2O4 electrodes. The all-fibril structure showed high conductivity 3D inter￾connected fiber networks, which provide uninterrupted fast electron transport paths. 
The CV curve (see Figure 8.9b) in the potential window of 0−1.6 V showed a slight 
variance at different scan rates of 5–200 mV s
−1. All-nanofiber asymmetric su￾percapacitor showed excellent electrochemical performance (64.83 F g−1 (10.84 F 
cm−3 at 0.25 A g−1) and 32.78 F g−1 (5.48 F cm−3 at 4 A g−1), highest for cellulose￾based asymmetric supercapacitor (see Figure 8.9c). All-nanofiber asymmetric su￾percapacitor device showed high values of both energy density (23.05 Wh kg−1) and 
power density (213 W kg−1) compared to other existing reported metal oxide-based 
230 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications asymmetric supercapacitor devices (see Figure 8.9d). The 93% retention of capa￾citance over 1000 cycles exhibits good cyclic stability due to the hierarchically 
porous structure, allowing ion diffusion during the charging/discharge process. 
8.4 SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK 
Developing efficient, portable, and renewable energy sources remains an important 
issue to overcome the challenges associated with fossil energy and global warming. 
As an advanced electrochemical energy storage device, supercapacitors have drawn 
significant attention in various emerging fields such as portable, smart-grids, and 
electric vehicles. Biopolymers and sustainable raw materials have been extensively 
investigated in response to the need for biodegradable and economical electrode 
materials. NC, a natural biopolymer substance, possesses many features such as 
biodegradability, nanoscale dimension, flexibility, high mechanical strength, ex￾cellent adaptability (exposed hydroxyl groups on surfaces), natural abundance, and 
biocompatibility. Owing to these characteristics, NC can be used as a matrix or 
nanofiller for supercapacitor electrodes. Since NC is not electrically conductive, it 
must be coupled with other active materials (CPs and metallic nanoparticles) or

234 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications converted to carbon form to develop highly porous conductive supercapacitor 
electrode materials with 3D-entangled network structures. This chapter reviewed 
the recent research advancements in developing NC-based conductive materials 
for supercapacitor electrodes. Although NC has been widely used in developing 
supercapacitor electrode materials, some challenges must be addressed in the future. 
1) Large-scale production of high-quality and uniform high aspect ratio, structures, 
surface chemical characteristics, and nanofibrillation degree. 2) Simplified pro￾duction facility for NC-based energy supercapacitors with optimized nanoscale 
structures, superior electronic conductivity, flexibility, mechanical properties, 
physical and chemical stability, and electrochemical performance. 3) Since the 
microstructure of NC has a significant impact on the mechanical and electro￾chemical performance of the supercapacitor, precise control of the size and porous 
structure of NC should be investigated in the future. 
As exemplified in this chapter, NC has significant potential and application as 
supercapacitor electrodes. It is envisaged that enhanced preparation, processing, 
and characterization techniques for cellulose nanomaterials would create a new era 
of environmentally friendly energy in which NC will be widely used in various 
energy-storage systems.

9.1 INTRODUCTION 
Because of the growing global worry about the scarcity of fossil fuels, researchers 
worked to find alternative renewable energy sources for power generation (Schlemmer 
et al. 2021). Polymer electrolytes have been considered a cutting-edge subject in the 
last decades due to their high ionic conductivity even at ambient or sub-ambient 
temperatures with a stable performance. In addition, they are low-cost, ecologically 
friendly, and have high flexibility. Thus, they have been used in many 
electrochemical-device applications such as batteries (Diana et al. 2021) and fuel cells 
(Mohanapriya et al. 2020). Electrolyte membranes are highly Ion-conducting mate￾rials that act as an electrolyte in moving electric charges between the two electrodes 
and providing a physical barrier between the cathode and the anode materials at the 
same time (Schlemmer et al. 2021). Polymer electrolytes have been classified based on 
their physical state and composition into dry solid, plasticized, gel, and composite 
polymer electrolytes (Di Noto et al. 2011). Also, it is affected by many different 
characteristics such as proton conductivity, mechanical qualities, chemical, and 
thermal stability, etc. These characteristics will be discussed in this chapter. 
9.2 CLASSIFICATION OF POLYMER ELECTROLYTES PES 
Polymer electrolytes have been classified according to materials used in their 
manufacturing into dry solid, plasticized, gel, and composite polymer electrolytes. 
9.2.1 DRY-SOLID POLYMER ELECTROLYTES (DSPES) 
Dry-solid polymer electrolytes (DSPEs) are created by dissolving inorganic salts in 
polar polymers. When exposed to an electric field, cations can travel from one 
246 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications coordinated site to another due to the cations’ poor coordination with sites along the 
polymer chain (Edman et al. 2000; Aziz et al. 2018). SPEs have other functions 
besides ionic conduction in cells and batteries; they act as a separator between 
the electrolyte and the electrode, minimizing the need for inert porous spacers. In 
addition, SPEs work as binders, allowing for easier electrical interaction with 
electrodes without requiring a high-temperature procedure as liquid electrolytes doo 
(Gray 1991; Ngai et al. 2016). 
9.2.2 PLASTICIZED POLYMER ELECTROLYTES (PPES) 
Plasticized polymer electrolytes are another type of PPEs, which have recently been 
widely utilized in many application devices such as fuel cells. The addition of 
plasticizers to polymer electrolytes decreases the glass-transition temperature and 
the crystallinity of the PE system. In addition, increasing the dissociation of salts 
and charge-carrier diffusions enhances the ionic conductivity. On the other hand, an 
obvious reduction occurs in the mechanical strength of the produced polymer 
electrolytes (Samir et al. 2004). Without mechanical strength, polymer electrolytes 
cannot resist the stress between the anode and the cathode (Kim et al. 2003). 
9.2.3 GEL-POLYMER ELECTROLYTES (GPES) 
Gel-polymer electrolytes (GPEs) possess a great advantage as they merge the 
liquid-state electrolyte properties, such as diffusivity and outstanding con￾ductivity, and solid-state electrolytes properties like cohesiveness and safety. Due 
to these unique characteristics, gel-polymer electrolytes have attracted more 
significant attention than other PEs (Stephan 2006). Gel electrolytes are thought 
to have high conductivity over solid electrolytes because of networks with many 
microporous filled with water that facilitate ions’ transportation (Moon et al. 
2015; Torres and De-la-Torre 2021). To prepare gel electrolytes, we mix alkali 
metal salt, a tremendous amount of organic solvent or plasticizer, and a suitable 
polymer matrix such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) which acts as a host cap￾turing the liquid content. As a result, GPE-based electrolyte products enhance 
safety more than liquid-based electrolyte products. GPEs exhibit some dis￾advantages, such as poor mechanical strength, the reactivity of the polar solvents 
toward the metal electrode, and solvent volatility (Agrawal and Pandey 2008; 
Ngai et al. 2016; Aziz et al. 2018). 
9.2.4 COMPOSITE-POLYMER ELECTROLYTES (CPES) 
To overcome the disadvantages and the limitations of SPEs, a new form of PEs 
called composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) was suggested. The main problem 
of SPEs is the poor ionic conductivity. This problem is due to the host polymers’ 
weak dielectric constant, which results in ion pairs (ion-ion association). 
Recently, scientists have dispersed inorganic inert fillers in the PEs matrix. 
Ceramic materials are used as inorganic fillers in PEs because they have 
low dielectric strength. SiO2 is usually used as a ceramic filler in this type of 
Green Polysaccharide Nanoparticles 247 electrolyte. It reduces the crystal content and the polymer’s glass-transition 
temperature (Mohapatra et al. 2009; Mulmi et al. 2009; Aziz et al. 2018). CPEs 
exhibit advantages such as high thermal stability, good flexibility, and con￾ductivity (Bruce and Vincent 1993; Kam et al. 2013). 
9.3 CRITERIA OF MEMBRANE SELECTION 
Membrane selection depends upon some properties that affect the electrolyte 
membrane, including the following: thermal stability, water absorption capability, 
proton conductivity, ionic conductivity, mechanical properties, and permeability. In 
this section, we will briefly discuss some of these criteria. 
Thermal stability is an essential character of PEM selection, usually assessed 
using thermogravimetric analysis (Iwaiand Yamanishi 2009). Thermally stable 
PEM have high reaction kinetic speeds, low electrode flooding, and minor catalyst 
poisoning (Sperling 2005). To improve the integration of hygroscopic fillers into 
PEM, nafion, for example, in a fuel cell is controlled by the stability and the 
concentration of cross-bonding among sulfonic groups. 
Water-uptake capacity is critical for retaining the polymer’s proton con￾ductivity. Water molecules are essential in proton-transport pathways, hence im￾proving the PEM’s capacity of water uptake, which is related positively to the 
protonic conductivity and other properties (Kumar and Carolin 2019). 
Ionic conductivity is one of the essential features of PEMs. A good PEM needs 
to have adequate ionic conductivity. It increases as the water content increases 
(H. S. Kim et al. 2003). For example, fuel cells have two types of ionic con￾ductivity: in-plane conductivity, which occurs along the surface of the membrane 
direction, and through-plane conductivity that occurs across the thickness of the 
membrane direction (Neburchilov et al. 2007). 
Proton conductivity is another important factor for determining the efficacy of 
PEM, especially in fuel cell applications. The components utilized in fuel cells need 
to obtain high proton conduction (Montoneri et al. 2010). So, the development of 
proton-conducting materials resulted in low internal resistance and high-power 
density output of fuel cells (Tang et al. 2012). Several factors influence proton 
conductivity, including relative humidity, ion exchange capacity, temperature, and 
polymer morphology (Yusmaniar et al. 2018). 
Mechanical stability is the most crucial factor due to its practical uses and 
lifetime (Peron et al. 2010). Efficient PEM should have excellent mechanical 
quality, solid ionic conductivity, and low thickness (Shengsheng Zhang et al. 
2009). Mechanical stability usually decreases as proton carriers increase. 
Hydrophobic domains of aromatic backbones give the PEMs better mechanical 
properties as these domains prevent the dissolution process (Rikukawa and Sanui 
2000; Yoshitake and Watakabe 2008). In addition, PEM undergoes chemical 
degradation over time due to the loss of functional groups caused by radicals 
formed by the corporation of H2 and O2. Several studies indicate that when the 
oxidative stability of the membranes decreases, a failure of energy conversion 
occurs. This oxidative stability is determined according to the dissolving capacity 
(Angulakshmi et al. 2011). 
248 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications Permeability is another fundamental factor affecting PEM. As the thickness of 
PEM decreases, the permeability increases (Kreuer 2001). 
9.4 CHEMICAL MODIFICATION OF POLYSACCHARIDES 
The electrolyte membrane is considered as the main component in different cells, so 
it must have the desired properties like high proton conductivity or ionic con￾ductivity, one of the most important characteristics that determines the effectiveness 
of the using membrane. Unfortunately, pure polysaccharide membranes do not 
achieve the desired proton conductivity or ionic conductivity to satisfy the cell 
targets (Ohma et al. 2019). To overcome this problem, it was better for combining 
the polysaccharides with proton-conducting polymers. In this way, proton con￾ductivity can be enhanced by making new proton transport pathways through the 
host polymer (Selyanchyn, Selyanchyn, and Lyth 2020). Improving the proton 
conductivity or ionic conductivity can be achieved also by modifying the chemical 
structure of polysaccharides. Considering the flexibility of the structure of biopo￾lymers, it makes them able to accommodate ions, making them easily modified by 
using amorphous polymers and dissolving the polymer in a salt liquid, or adding 
metal salt into the polymeric solution to alter the crystallinity of the polymer (J. H. 
Kim et al. 2004; Gong et al. 2016; Aziz et al. 2019). Another modification was 
developed by Schoenenberger et al. as they introduced a detailed study about the 
reaction between cellulose ethers and various poly ether-based isocyanate. Also, 
they mentioned that the modified cellulosic structure provides good film-forming 
properties (Schoenenberger et al. 1995). 
9.4.1 EXAMPLES OF CHEMICALLY MODIFIED AND COMBINED 
POLYSACCHARIDES 
9.4.1.1 Cellulose-Based PEM 
Normal bacterial nanocellulose BNC shows poor ionic conductivity (Gadim et al. 
2017; Vilela, Silva, et al. 2020). However, lignosulfonates have a high content of 
sulfonate groups, which by adsorption of water molecules produce paths for the 
structural diffusion of protons. These paths translated into separators with ionic 
conductivity. So, they are solid contenders for biobased ion-conducting materials. 
In Vilela et al. experiment, they produced biobased ion-exchange membranes for 
polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). They blended BNC and lignosulfonates via 
diffusion of an aqueous solution of the lignosulfonates and tannic acid as natural￾cross-linker into the wet BNC nanofibrous. The membrane with the highest lig￾nosulfonates content showed the highest ionic conductivity with 23 mScm−1 at 
94°C and 98% RH (Vilela, Morais et al. 2020). 
Another study used bacterial cellulose nanofibers to design PEMs. The BC na￾nofibrous used fucoidan (derived from brown algae) aqueous solution and tannic 
acid as a cross-linker. After heating, the produced PEMs, which have the highest 
fucoidan content, showed a protonic conductivity of 1.6 mScm−1 at 94°C and 98% 
RH (Vilela, Silva et al. 2020). 
Green Polysaccharide Nanoparticles 249 Priyangga et al. developed nanocellulose NC composite membranes modified 
with imidazole Im and phosphotungstic acid PTA using the phase-inversion 
method. The NC/Im membrane achieved the highest proton conductivity with 
14.98 mScm−1. The NC/PTA showed conductivity at 13.17 mScm−1, while NC/Im/ 
PTA membranes showed 6.34 mScm−1. The increased ionic conductivity was due to 
imidazole heterocyclic molecules, which facilitated the proton pathway, while the 
phosphotungstic acid form helped in the proton flow (Ilbeygi et al. 2019; Shaobo 
Zhang et al. 2019; Priyangga et al. 2020). (See Figure 9.1.). 
9.4.1.2 Chitosan-Based PEM 
Barbara Kaker et al. used graphene oxide (GO) in improving polymer-based na￾nocomposite anion-exchange membranes (AEMs) for direct alkaline ethanol fuel 
cells. They also used dodecyl 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate DTHB as the cross-linking 
agent and benzyl trimethyl ammonium chloride BTMAC as the hydroxide con￾ductor in designing CS−Mg (OH)2 (CS + Mg)-based AEM composites. The CS/Mg 
membrane achieved high ionic conductivity with 89.1 ± 3.0 mScm−1 at 40°C. The 
CS/Mg membrane with GO, which their distribution in the matrix enhanced the 
tortuous ionic channels and transfer barrier for OH− ions, achieved the lowest ionic 
conductivity with 76.3 ± 2.1 mScm−1. When BTMAC is added to the CS/Mg/GO 
membrane, the ionic conductivity enhanced to 142.5 ± 4.0 mScm−1, as the BTMAC 
improved the dispersion of GO clusters to provide a pathway for the transmission 
of hydroxide anion. While the cross-linking with DTHB reduced the ionic con￾ductivity to 92.8 mScm−1, the DTHB molecules hindered the OH− transportation 
through the membrane (Kaker et al. 2019). 
Divya et al. developed a proton exchange membrane by blending sulfonated 
chitosan S-Chitosan and sulfonated graphene oxide SGO nanosheets for direct 
methanol fuel cells DMFCs via a simple solution-casting method. They made 
pure S-chitosan membrane and S-chitosan membranes with 0.5 and 1 wt% of SGO. 
FIGURE 9.1 SEM images of NC/Im. 
250 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications The S-chitosan membrane with the concentration of 1 wt% of SGO showed proton 
conductivity of 4.86 × 10−3 Scm−1 at 25°C, as the addition of SGO provided more 
SO3H groups, leading to ionic clusters creating a new network for proton con￾duction (Shirdast, Sharif, and Abdollahi 2016), which enhanced the proton con￾ductivity. They approved that S-chitosan/SGO nanocomposite proton exchange 
membranes can potentially alternate Nafion (Divya et al. 2021). (See Figure 9.2.). 
FIGURE 9.2 SEM images of the membranes. 
Green Polysaccharide Nanoparticles 251 9.4.1.3 Pectin-Based PEM 
Muthukrishnan et al. used pectin, ammonium formate (AF), and ethylene carbonate (EC) 
to produce biopolymer membranes. Pectin was used as a host polymer, AF was used as 
proton donor salt, and EC as the plasticizer. Their produced membrane with 50 Mwt% of 
pectin, AF and 0.4 wt% of EC showed the highest ionic conductivity with (3.6 ± 0.21) × 
10−3 Scm−1. When the EC was added to the sample, it increased the free volume of the 
pectin host, leading to facilitating the rapid rotation of the polymer chain; as a result, the 
ionic conductivity of the membrane increased (Muthukrishnan et al. 2021). 
9.4.1.4 Carrageenan-Based PEM 
Arockia Mary et al. used carrageenan to produce a biopolymer membrane for lithium￾ion batteries. They used 1 g of Kappa-carrageenan with different concentrations of 
LiNO3. Their produced membrane with 0.65 wt% of LiNO3 has achieved the highest 
ionic conductivity with 1.89 × 10−3 Scm−1. The increased concentration of salt leads 
to an increase in the charge-carrier concentration, which increases the ionic con￾ductivity as a result. When they used a higher concentration of salt about 0.7 wt%, the 
ionic conductivity decreased because of the aggregation of the salt and the increase in 
the degree of crystallinity (Moniha et al. 2018; Arockia Mary et al. 2020). 
9.4.1.5 Alginate-Based PEM 
Shaari et al. used alginate to produce PEM as they used it in form of sodium alginate. 
Besides the sodium alginate used as matrix phase, they used alumina as nanofiller in 
the PEM to enhance the proton conductivity. Their produced membrane with 15% 
alumina showed the highest proton conductivity with 25.6 × 10−3 Scm−1 at 60°C. The 
enhanced proton conductivity is due to the ability of sodium alginate to attract water 
molecules and the action of the added alumina as they worked like bridges for protons 
across polymer matrices (Shaari and Kamarudin 2020) (Figure 9.3). 
9.5 SOURCES OF POLYSACCHARIDES UTILIZED AS AN 
ELECTROLYTE MEMBRANE 
9.5.1 ALGAL POLYSACCHARIDES 
Interestingly, polysaccharides have been found from micro algae, for example, 
alginate, agar, agro see, and carrageenan, which sparks interest globally. Algal 
FIGURE 9.3 FESEM images for sodium alginate with 15% alumina. 
252 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications polysaccharides are biodegradable, cost-effective, high-performance, and en￾vironmentally friendly options available for providing higher solid polymer elec￾trolytes for advanced electrochemical applications (Torres and De-la-Torre 2021). 
Algal polysaccharides like agar, carrageenan, fucoidan, alginate, and ulvan are 
found in polysaccharide-rich seaweeds’ cell walls and intracellular structures (Şahin 
2021). Agar is a hydrophilic colloid polysaccharide derived from several marine 
algae of the rhodophyceae class, where it happens as a structural carbohydrate in 
cell walls and is likely to play a role in ion-exchange and dialysis processes (Selby 
and Whistler 1993). Alternatively, carrageenans are sulfated linear polysaccharides 
derived from rhodophyceae red seaweeds. Fucoidans are heterologous poly￾saccharides in brown macroalgae extracted from sargassum siliquosum (S. H. 
Wang et al. 2020), while alginate naturally exists in water-soluble polysaccharides 
from diverse brown algae species (Jahandideh, Ashkani, and Moini 2021). 
9.5.2 PLANT POLYSACCHARIDES 
Plant polysaccharides (PP) are classified into storage polysaccharides like starch 
and structural polysaccharides like cellulose, hemicelluloses, pectin, and lignin. 
(Kikuchi and Yamada 2020). PP can be extracted from vegetables, fruits, cereals, 
and legumes. Cellulose is the major PP on earth, compensating for about 15%–30% 
of the dry mass overall primary cell walls (Moo-Young 2019). Hemicelluloses are 
heteropolymers embedded in the cell wall of plants, and they differ in their structure 
according to the origin, like mannas and galactomannanes (Izydorczyk et al. 2005). 
Pectin, also known as pectic substances, refers to a group of closely related poly￾saccharides found in plant cell walls and can be obtained from agro-by-products 
such as citrus peel and apple pomace (Voragen et al. 2009). Fructans are present in 
plants and seem to behave as backup carbohydrates while improving cold and 
drought tolerance (Stick and Williams 2009). 
9.5.3 BACTERIAL POLYSACCHARIDES 
Polysaccharide constituents play critical functional and structural roles in bacterial 
cell life. The first barrier against pathogens and bacteriophages is defined by cap￾sular polysaccharides and LPS (Varki et al. 1999). Staskawicz et al. Extracted 
polysaccharides of pseudomonas solanacearum (Staskawicz et al. 1983). The 
most common resource in nature is chitin in the second position after cellulose 
(Song, Shang, and Ratner 2012). (Table 9.1) 
9.6 A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS DEALING WITH THE 
POLYSACCHARIDE ELECTROLYTE MEMBRANE 
Recently, with the depletion in the nonrenewable energy sources as fossil fuels, 
researchers have taken on finding alternative energy sources. Alternative means not 
only a substitution for fossil fuels but also safe for the environment. This part of the 
chapter will discuss some of these applications briefly. 
Green Polysaccharide Nanoparticles 253 9.6.1 FUEL CELLS 
Fuel cells are considered as ecofriendly energy-converter devices since they convert 
chemical energy resulting from a redox reaction into electrical energy (Ma and 
Sahai 2013); they are presumed to be one of the most promising candidates as zero￾emission power sources (Li 2005). A fuel cell consists of two thin electrodes 
(porous anode and cathode) packing an electrolyte material in between. The input 
fuel passes over the anode and oxygen passes over the cathode where they are 
dissociated catalytically into ions and electrons. The electrons pass through an 
external electrical circuit to provide power while the ions move through the elec￾trolyte toward the oppositely charged electrode (Ye, Rick, and Hwang 2012; 
Li 2005). 
In general, fuel cells are characterized upon the electrolyte material type into H2 
fuels where hydrogen has an important role in the anode and the non-H2 fuel cells 
where chemical compounds such as ethanol act as an electron donor in the anode 
(Cooper 2007; Sopian and Daud 2006). Therefore, high efficiency, high energy 
density, quiet operation, and environmentally friendly properties were the most 
advantages of fuel cells (Ye, Rick, and Hwang 2012). 
Nafion (a commercial perfluoro-sulphonic acid-based membrane) is mostly uti￾lized in fuel cells where low proton conductivity under anhydrous conditions, high 
cost, and nonenvironmental friendliness are their disadvantages. That is why

254 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications researchers were very concerned in studying other alternative materials for ob￾taining high-performance fuel cells excluding non-eco-friendly annon-eco-friendly. 
Biopolymer-based membranes, such as chitosan, cellulose, and carrageenan, 
were studied as alternative materials for enhancing fuel cell performance since they 
are natural and abundant polymers solving the drawbacks of nafions as an alternate. 
Both ionic liquids and modified biopolymer-based membranes, including the use of 
biopolymers in the nanosize form, were studied for their potential to improve the 
ionic conductivity and thermal stability of fuel cell applications (Adiera et al. 2020). 
Bayer et al. (2016) had investigated fuel cells with nanocellulose membranes, 
mentioning that nanocellulose paper can be utilized in fuel cells, but require significant 
optimization to compete with nafion. A combination of nanofibrous bacterial cellulose 
(BC) and an algael polysaccharide fucoidan (Fuc) were investigated by (Vilela, Silva, 
et al. 2020), and exhibited protonic conductivity that increases directly with relative 
humidity (RH), which is a typical feature for numerous water-mediated proton con￾ductors. (Mohanapriya et al. 2020) used a mixture of pectin (PC), polyvinyl alcohol 
(PVA), and sulfonated titanium dioxide (S-TiO2) nanoparticles where they found that 
this mixture improved the proton conductivity and restricted methanol permeability. 
9.6.2 BATTERIES 
Lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries are other types of energy storage devices that 
store electrical energy in a chemical form and can be rechargeable (Boaretto et al. 
2020). However, on the industrial scale, there is a global demand for sodium-ion 
batteries to be used in different applications as sodium is an abundant element that 
makes the batteries cheaper than others (Chawla and Safa 2019). Safety, toxicity, 
and recycling are the environmental challenges that need to be improved in batteries 
and their components (Schlemmer et al. 2021). 
Generally, lithium-ion batteries require an adhesive polymer binder because of 
the mechanical stress resulting during the charge/discharge process. (Gendensuren 
and Oh 2018) investigated modified bio-derived alginate as a binder for A proving 
its strong mechanical property. Another investigation by (Hu et al. 2019) worked on 
a modified natural polysaccharide (carboxymethylated gellan gum) as a water￾soluble high-performance binder for silicon anodes in lithium-ion batteries for 
better capacity performance by controlling the volume change in silicon occurred 
during the charge/discharge process. 
In sodium-ion batteries, researchers were concerned with the development of 
electrodes and electrolytes. (Diana et al. 2021) investigated the utilization of new 
sodium alginate (a biopolymer) and sodium thiocyanate (NaSCN) combination as 
an electrolyte membrane in sodium-ion batteries for the first time. (Jo et al. 2020) 
worked on a novel composite of cellulose–polyacrylonitrile–alumina as a separator 
displaying good thermal stability and electrolyte uptake. 
9.6.3 DYE-SENSITIZED SOLAR CELLS 
Solar radiation is one of the renewable energy sources concerning most researchers 
recently due to the depletion of fossil fuels globally (Hasan, Islam, and 
Green Polysaccharide Nanoparticles 255 Rashid 2020). Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) depend upon photovoltaic con￾version where solar radiation produces excited electrons that are injected into a 
conduction band causing oxidation of the dye. Then, the dye is regained to the 
ground state by electron donation from the reduced state of the electrolyte, which in 
turn is regenerated by the reduction of the oxidized species of the electrolyte at the 
counter-electrode (Nagaraj et al. 2017). 
Materials in which the electrolyte is made have played an important role as they 
are responsible for carrying the charge between anode and cathode, and con￾tinuously reproducing the dye. They also have a great effect on the stability and the 
energy-conversion process. Hence, researchers were having much concern in 
studying the effect of different biopolymers as an alternative eco-friendly and low￾cost electrolyte materials rather than usually synthetic ones (Wu et al. 2015). 
(Nagaraj et al. 2017) investigated a new biopolymer gel electrolyte based on 
potato starch and studied the effect of cross-linking degree of the starch mixture 
they prepared in this investigation. (Yusuf et al. 2014) studied the ionic conductivity 
properties of the cell by using phthaloylchitosan as a gel-polymer electrolyte in 
combination with tetrapropylammonium iodide, Pr4NI, as the salt. 
On the other hand, (Yang, Guo, and Zhao 2012) worked on a new composite 
polymer electrolyte based on the polysaccharide agarose, where they found that 
both thermal and ionic conductivity characteristics of the polymer electrolyte were 
affected when the titanium oxide is added as a filler into the agarose matrix. (Singh 
et al. 2013) have added potassium iodide into a biopolymer matrix based on agarose 
to improve the ionic conductivity. 
9.6.4 SUPERCAPACITOR 
Supercapacitors are other types of energy-storage devices that have been developed 
because of the growing revolution in portable electronic systems (Dunn, Kamath, and 
Tarascon 2011; Tarascon and Armand 2011). Supercapacitors referred to an electrical 
double-layer capacitor demonstrating a high electric capacity with more advantages 
over the ordinary batteries. The electrolyte polymer of the supercapacitors also have 
the characteristics for making the capacitors light in weight, flexible, and stable 
(Nishide and Oyaizu 2008; Pérez-Madrigal, Edo, and Alemán 2016). 
As researchers had taken on the priority of the environment, they were concerned 
with developing alternatives for the electrolyte polymers of supercapacitors by 
replacing them with biopolymers due to their safety. They studied their effect on the 
electric performance of supercapacitors, so polysaccharides were the choice for 
being the alternative of the ordinary synthetic polymers (Poizot and Dolhem 2011; 
Pérez-Madrigal, Edo, and Alemán 2016; Z. Wang et al. 2017). 
Saliu et al. (2021) designed a nano-level starch-gelatin incorporated with nano￾TiO2 for being used in supercapacitors, and they demonstrated the effectiveness of 
that nanohybrid biopolymer for supercapacitor devices in energy storage applica￾tions (Shu et al. 2020). This study worked on hierarchical composite porous carbon 
(HPC) materials derived from polysaccharides carboxymethyl cellulose, bacterial 
cellulose, and citric acid, as a promising electrode for supercapacitors in which the 
resultant HPC displayed unique porous nanosheet morphology with high specific 
256 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications surface area. Another investigation introduced by Lee et al. 2017 demonstrated 
a new class of coffee-mediated green activation of cellulose for being used in all 
paper flexible supercapacitors (Lee et al. 2017). 
9.7 CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES IN USING 
POLYSACCHARIDES AS ELECTROLYTE MEMBRANES 
The previous chapter showed that polysaccharides can be more effective as a PEM than 
nafion, but they may be difficult to use in commercial applications since it is 
a challenge to translate single cells into functioning devices. Another challenge 
is estimating the production costs, the possibility of providing the raw materials, and 
identifying problems facing production, which needs pilot lines for battery production. 
Even if companies participate in research and development activities, they will not 
invest in new technologies due to the possibility of higher losses. 
However, as the environment and sustainability of the electrolyte membrane 
have become more important in the last years, polysaccharides have the opportunity 
to be used. That is because of their abundance, ecofriendly nature, and ability to be 
combined and chemically modified. 
9.8 CONCLUSION 
With the increasing worldwide levels of global warming and pollution, there is a 
great demand for new technologies that depend upon natural compounds rather than 
synthetic products that are hazardous and also difficult to recycle. Polysaccharides 
as natural compounds provide different properties. They are abundant, low cost to 
obtain, safe to the environment, and biodegradable, making them perfect alter￾natives for synthetic materials, especially as polymer electrolyte membranes in 
electronic devices. They can be chemically modified or combined with other con￾ducting materials for higher effectiveness. So, finding a polysaccharide with higher 
efficiency is one of the challenges most researchers face.

10.1 INTRODUCTION 
Global power consumption has witnessed a steady rise over the last few years due 
to the development of modern society. This has led to an increased focus on using 
sustainable, environmentally friendly, and renewable resources. Energy-storage 
devices such as batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) have shown excellent po￾tential for future use. However, significant challenges still exist regarding pro￾duction and overall operation costs, safety, and the use of renewable materials in 
energy-storage devices (Simon and Gogotsi 2010). Batteries and SCs comprise 
two electrodes (anode and cathode), an electrolyte, and a separator. Separators 
play a vital role in energy-storage devices by maintaining electrical insulation 
between the anode and the cathode. This reduces the chances of a short circuit 
occurring and contributes toward an improved overall safety of the energy￾storage device. Separators also play a crucial role in facilitating ion transfer. 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003245261-12 265 An excellent separator must have: high thermal and chemical stability, porosity, 
surface hydrophilicity, and superior mechanical properties. A highly porous se￾parator can enable strong electrolyte uptake and high ionic conductivity, allowing 
energy-storage devices to have higher capacitance (L. Li et al. 2018). However, 
very few researchers have concentrated their efforts on improving the chemical 
composition and morphology of separator membranes (H. Wang et al. 2018; Peng 
et al. 2019). 
Polyolefins like polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) are commonly used 
separators because of their high ionic conductivity and excellent electrochemical 
stability. However, many drawbacks have been associated with the use of 
polyolefin-based separators. Firstly, the polyolefin-based separators are highly re￾stricted in energy-storage devices that meet high-power demands and function at 
high temperatures, mainly due to their low melting point (130°C–160°C). Secondly, 
the petrochemical process used to produce raw materials required to manufacture 
these separators is not eco-friendly or sustainable. 
Nanocellulose (NC) has gained immense importance over recent years due to 
its increasing applications in sensors, energy harvesters, reinforced polymers, etc. 
(Mangayil et al. 2017). The most commonly used methods for preparing NC 
include acid hydrolysis, mechanical separation, and chemical pretreatments (Guo 
et al. 2020). Based on their structures and properties, NC can broadly be classified 
into three subcategories: cellulose nanofibers (CNF), cellulose nanocrystals 
(CNC), and bacterial cellulose (BC). CNFs have a high aspect ratio (>200) and a 
web-like entangled structure, and hence, they can be developed into films or 
aerogels. CNCs are highly crystalline and possess a large surface area of about 
250–500 m2 gm−1. BCs, on the other hand, are constituted of highly pure cel￾lulose and have a web-like entangled structure. However, the cost of producing 
BCs is substantially higher than that of CNCs and CNFs because of the high 
number of nutrients required to culture the acetobacter and the slow rate of BC 
production (Chen et al. 2018). 
In general, NCs are not electrically conductive. Hence, they cannot be used to 
make energy-storage devices directly. To make NCs electrically conductive, they 
are combined with conductive materials such as carbonaceous materials (like 
graphene, carbon black, carbon nanotubes (CNT)), conductive polymers, and 
metallic particles. This can be achieved by coating the NCs with a layer of 
conducting material using vapor deposition or sputter coating. Another common 
method is to combine the conductive material and the NC substrate to make a 
composite. This can be accomplished through in situ polymerization or mixing. 
The composite materials combine the advantages of both conductive materials 
and NC (Du et al. 2017). Additionally, NCs exhibit promising mechanical 
properties such as Young’s modulus of about 138 GPa. The hydroxyl groups on 
the NC’s surface enable chemical alterations with active materials. The ratios of 
active materials can be modified so that the resulting NC-based composite has 
suitable electrochemical properties. Apart from this, NC exhibits high stability in 
most solvents and has good stability over a wide electrochemical window. 
Figure 10.1 highlights the suitable properties and potential applications of NC in 
energy-storage devices. 
266 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications Separators can broadly be classified as nonwovens, microporous membranes, 
and composite membranes. Nonwoven membranes refer to randomly oriented fibers 
to form a network structure further reinforced into membranes using mechanical, 
chemical linking, and thermal-bonding methods. Microporous membranes widely 
used in lead-acid and alkaline batteries mainly comprise cellulose and paper-based 
separators (Schlemmer et al. 2021). Natural materials such as lignin and cellulose 
and their derivatives and synthetic materials, such as poly (vinylidene fluoride) 
(PVDF), PA (polyamide), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), etc., have been used to fabricate 
such membranes. The electrospinning process is one of the commonly used 
methods for fabricating these membranes with controlled structure and morphology. 
Although the electrospinning process suffers from drawbacks such as low 
throughput and the high cost of production, it still has the potential to create new 
materials in the future. 
Polymers have long been used to fabricate separator membranes for batteries and 
SCs. Recent advances have focused on the possible usage of polymer ceramic 
membranes in batteries and SCs. 
Researchers have noticed increased porosity when ceramic particles are in￾corporated into polymer matrices, which leads to improved ionic conductivity due 
to the increase in the amorphous region in the crystalline polymer matrix (Bon 
et al. 2018). In one such work, BaTiO3 and NiO were used as filler materials to 
fabricate nanocomposite separator films using PVDF. Films of 50 µm thickness 
were fabricated using the solution-mixing technique. These films’ porosity and 
ionic conductivity (83% and 19.8 mS cm−1, respectively) were significantly 
higher than commercially available cellulose membranes (65% porosity and 
FIGURE 10.1 Properties and potential application of nanocellulose in energy storage de￾vices ( Chen et al. 2018). 
Nanocellulose-Based Separators 267 10 mS cm−1 ionic conductivity). Such promising properties of polymer ceramic 
membranes have encouraged researchers to explore further the possibility of 
creating more advanced separators with suitable properties. However, polymeric 
membranes have limited applications in SCs due to their low electrolyte wett￾ability, intrinsic hydrophobicity, and low ionic conductivity (Sharma and Gaur 
2021). Furthermore, with an increasing need for green, environmentally friendly, 
and eco-efficient materials, researchers have concentrated on biodegradable, cost￾effective, non-toxic green materials for the sustainable manufacturing of se￾parators/SCs. NC has demonstrated an ability to be employed as an alternate 
material in fabricating separators. The cost of production of NC separators is 
lower compared to conventional separators. NC-based separators also have good 
mechanical properties and thermal stability and can be used in storage devices 
working under high-power applications. NC-based separators’ electrolyte wett￾ability is also significantly higher (Guo et al. 2020). 
On the other hand, composite membranes can be classified as inorganic, or￾ganic, or inorganic-organic hybrid membranes, depending on the fillers used. 
These composite separator membranes exhibit superior performance. For in￾stance, a PVDF-HFP (poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)/CNC 
composite separator was found to be a more suitable separator material for 
lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as compared to the PVDF-HFP-based separators as it 
exhibited better mechanical properties, including higher Young’s modulus and 
tensile strength (Kelley, Simonsen, and Ding 2013). Composite membranes 
can also be fabricated by depositing polymers onto the surface of commercial 
separators. 
10.2 NC-BASED SEPARATORS FOR BATTERIES 
10.2.1 LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES 
LIBs have emerged at the forefront to meet the energy-storage demands of modern 
applications, such as electric vehicles and hybrid electronic devices. Over the past 
couple of decades, polymers have been widely explored as a potential separator 
material for LIBs. Polymers such as PVDF (Costa et al. 2014), polyimide (PI) 
(Shayapat, Chung, and Park 2015), poly (methyl methacrylate), and (PMMA) (Cho 
et al. 2011) have been extensively used in the past. However, due to growing en￾vironmental concerns, there has been an increased focus on using environment￾friendly recyclable polymers. One such polymer material that has shown great 
potential is poly-l-lactic acid (PLLA). PLLA is a biodegradable polymer and can 
easily be recycled compared to other polymers. Separators fabricated using PLLA 
have a porosity value of about 72% and an electrolyte uptake over 250% (see 
Figures 10.2a and b). The tortuosity value for the PLLA membrane with 10% 
polymer concentration was 2.3, which is comparable with commercial separators, 
whose value lies in the range of 2.5–4.1. Since PLLA performs similarly to other 
polymers as a separator, it can be considered a potential alternate material (Barbosa 
et al. 2020). 
268 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications The separators used in LIBs do not participate directly in the electrochemical 
reactions occurring within the battery but play a crucial role in the transportation 
of the Li+ ions and the battery’s overall safety. These separators must possess a 
particular set of essential properties to exhibit satisfactory performance. It is 
foremost essential that a separator be chemically stable toward the electrode and 
electrolyte. The separator must also be electrochemically stable during strong 
oxidation and reduction circumstances during charge-discharge cycles. Another 
essential aspect that affects the separator’s performance is the porosity of the 
FIGURE 10.2 a) Electrolyte uptake value, b) Uptake as a function of the time of the PLLA 
membrane of different polymer concentrations ( Barbosa et al. 2020), c) Image showing the 
electrolyte wettability and electrolyte immersion-height after 1 hour of the commercial PP￾PE-PP, BC and BC/Al2O3 separator, d) Uptake capacity as a function of time of the PP-PE￾PP and BC/Al2O3 separator (Q. Xu et al. 2017), e) Electrolyte wettability, f) Electrolyte

ECM22, and ECM12 separator membrane ( Sheng et al. 2020). 
Nanocellulose-Based Separators 269 separator membrane. The pores in the separators must be small enough to prevent 
electrode particles from penetrating yet large enough to allow electrolyte ion 
transport. These pores must also be uniformly distributed throughout the se￾parator membrane. Commercially fabricated separators’ porosity ranges between 
40% and 50% (Heidari and Mahdavi 2020). The pore size and tortuosity of the 
pores influence the electrolyte wettability and the ionic conductivity of the se￾parator. Ideally, separators used along with electrolytes exhibit an ionic con￾ductivity ranging between 10−3 and 10−1 S cm−1. 
To minimize the internal resistance of the separator, it is desired that the 
separator be as thin as possible. However, this would compromise the me￾chanical properties of the separator membrane. It is also essential that separators 
possess mechanical properties such as good tensile and puncture strength. The 
thickness of the separator must be chosen to balance both these properties. 
Commercially used separators have a thickness varying between 5 µm and 
25 µm (Zhai et al. 2021). 
Apart from these basic requirements, it is also desirable that separators possess 
some additional properties that enhance the functioning of the LIBs and improve 
their overall safety. Separators in high-temperature applications must keep their 
dimensional stability at extreme temperatures and shut down to prevent pores 
from clogging in the case of overheating. The shrinkage in separators should not 
exceed 5% at a temperature of 100°C for 60 minutes. Flame-retardant properties 
are also desirable in separators as most electrolytes used in modern-day batteries 
are flammable. Separators with self-healing properties that can heal cracks and 
damage have also gained importance in recent years. Self-healing separators 
enhance the overall safety of the battery and improve the service life of the 
separator. 
BC has emerged as a material of great interest for fabricating separator mem￾branes for LIBs. BC-based separators exhibit good dimensional thermal stability, 
with negligible deformation at elevated temperatures of 200°C. In comparison, a 
commercial Celgard 2340 separator begins to show thermal shrinkage at tem￾peratures as high as 80 °C. However, low tensile strength (>80 MPa) and porosity 
have impeded BC-based separators’ widespread use. Surface modification of 
BC-based separators has been explored as a potential technique for improving its 
properties. Al2O3 powder is commonly used as a surface modifier due to its che￾mical inertness, excellent thermal stability, and good wettability. The properties of 
composite BC/ Al2O3 separator membranes fabricated utilizing an in-situ thermal 
decomposition technique were significantly improved (Q. Xu et al. 2017). The 
electrolyte uptake and porosity were reported to be 625% and 74% respectively in 
BC/ Al2O3 separator membranes (see Table 10.1) as compared to 390% and 70.5% 
in BC-based separator membranes and 225% and 44.5% in commercial PP-PE-PP 
(Celgard 2340) separator (see Figures 10.2c and d). The tensile strength was also 
found to improve from 65 to 140 MPa. The good electrochemical and mechanical 
properties exhibited by the BC/ Al2O3 separator have made it a potential separator 
membrane that can be used in high-power LIBs operating between a voltage range 
of 2.5 to 4.2 V.

Nanocellulose-Based Separators 271 Bacterial CNCs (BCNCs) produced by acid hydrolysis of BC fibers are highly 
hydrophilic and biodegradable, making them suitable for energy-storage devices. 
The average diameter and length of BCNCs were obtained around 10–50 nm and 
100–1500 nm, respectively (Singhsa, Narain, and Manuspiya 2018). BCNCs were 
successfully reinforced to polyether block amide (PEBAX) as a matrix material to 
fabricate BCNCs/PEBAX microporous membranes employing nonsolvent-induced 
phase separation followed by film casting. The sulfated BCNCs produced by 
H2SO4-hydrolysis had more significant negative charges on their surface and higher 
aspect ratios, which aided in reinforcing and provided good thermal and dimen￾sional stability. The separator membrane containing 20 wt% BCNCs had 56.8% 
porosity, 101.4% electrolyte uptake, and ionic conductivity of 9.79 mS cm−1 (see 
Table 10.1), making it a promising separator candidate for LIBs (Ajkidkarn and 
Manuspiya 2020). 
The demand for lighter and thinner LIBs is rising with potential applications in 
smart wearable devices. This can be achieved by optimizing the thickness of the 
separator membranes in LIBs. Researchers have been able to fabricate ethanol￾soaked separator membranes from CNFs with a thickness of 12 µm (ECM12) and 
weight of half as compared to that of conventional polyolefin separators (Celgard 
2325). The ECM12 separator possesses a mesoporous structure with a porosity of 
59%, the ionic conductivity of 0.26 mS cm−1 (see Table 10.1), and electrolyte 
uptake of 281% (see Figures 10.2e and f). The ultra-thin and ultra-light, these se￾parator membranes excellent showed tensile strength and better thermal stability 
(see Figure 10.2g) (Sheng et al. 2020). 
10.2.2 LITHIUM-SULFUR BATTERIES 
Lithium-sulfur batteries (Li-S batteries) have piqued researchers’ interest as a po￾tential replacement for LIBs. They possess a higher energy density (2600 Wh kg−1) 
and are more environmentally friendly than LIBs (Ma, Ma, and Cui 2019). Apart 
from this, sulfur (S) is cheap, abundantly available, and environmentally friendly, 
making it an attractive prospect for energy storage devices. 
Li-S batteries consist of an anode fabricated from sulfur, a cathode fabricated 
from Li-based materials, and an electrolyte. The electrochemical reaction oc￾curring between sulfur and lithium is responsible for converting the chemical 
energy into electrical energy in the battery. Apart from properties such as: having 
a reasonable thickness, porosity, wettability, and excellent thermal and chemical 
stability, it is desired that the separators also possess ion-selective permeability. 
This is responsible for avoiding the migration and permeation of soluble 
polysulfides. 
Rechargeable battery cells with liquid organic electrolytes tend to experience the 
formation of dendrites. These dendrites develop a new surface on the anode, 
forming a solid electrolyte interface, causing capacitance fading. In some cases, 
these dendrites form and expand from the solid alkali-metal anode toward the 
cathode leading to an internal short circuit. Thus, dendrite formation poses a sig￾nificant safety hazard for rechargeable battery cells. However, liquid organic 
electrolytes are inevitable until a solid or ionic liquid (IL) electrolyte has an 
272 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications equivalent ionic conductivity. Such growth of dendrites is inevitable in Li-S bat￾teries. These dendrites form on the Li surface through uneven electrodeposition due 
to the nonuniform electric field and lithium flux. Electrons converge on the peaks 
of these uneven surfaces and intensify the preferential deposition leading to self￾propagating dendrite growth. These dendrites can penetrate the separator membrane 
resulting in capacity loss and other safety hazards. The internal accumulation of 
heat is also a major concern, especially when polyolefin separators are used, as this 
could lead to thermal shrinkage of the separator. This could also lead to direct 
contact between the cathode and anode, leading to a short circuit (Wei et al. 2020). 
Thus, the role of separators in Li-S batteries is crucial and highlighted in 
Figure 10.3. 
The intermediate polysulfide compounds formed in Li-S batteries are soluble 
in organic liquid electrolytes. This results in the shuttle effect, wherein these 
polysulfide compounds react to the Li anode and corrode it. Several approaches, 
such as adding additives to reduce the solubility of polysulfide compounds in the 
electrolyte and modification of separators, have been used to reduce the shuttling 
effect (Huang et al. 2015). In one such work, porous cellulose-based separators 
were used in Li-S batteries having a liquid organic electrolyte. The separator 
membrane obstructed the polysulfides, with only a small portion penetrating 
through the membrane’s pores to reach the anode. The anode surface was smooth 
after 100 and 1000 cycles, respectively. In comparison, when a commercial 
Celgard 2500 separator was used, irregular dendrite structures were found to have 
formed on the anode surface after 100 cycles. It was concluded that the nano￾sized porous NC membrane may have played a crucial role in suppressing the 
dendrite formation on the anode (Yu et al. 2016). 
Modification of separators has also been explored as a potential method of 
inhibiting the shuttle effect. One such modification was carried out by coating 
FIGURE 10.3 The function of separators in Li-S batteries ( Wei et al. 2020). 
Nanocellulose-Based Separators 273 carbonized bacterial cellulose/titania (CBC / TiO2) onto the surface of a pristine 
separator facing the cathode (F. Li et al. 2017). TiO2 has a strong electrostatic 
attraction toward S and can adsorb polysulfides, thus improving cyclic stability 
and capacity retention. Analysis of the sides of the separators (with and without 
CBC/TiO2 coating) facing the anode after a certain number of cycles revealed 
deposition of Li2S2 and Li2S. This deposition was less apparent in the separators 
with the coating of CBC/TiO2. This can be attributed to the CBC / TiO2 modified 
separator’s strong shuttle effect suppression, allowing polysulfides to permeate 
from the cathode to the anode. As a result, the lithium anode is protected from the 
production of lithium dendrites. The use of cellulose-based separators is also 
attributed to the reduced formation of high surface area lithium (HSAL) on the 
electrodes in batteries due to improved wettability of the lithium surface. This 
was observed in one such work wherein CNF (aka NFC) separators of varying 
thickness (31 to 62 µm) and different loading of cellulose fibers was used as 
separators (Pavlin et al. 2019). A TGA analysis of the NFC separator revealed 
thermal stability up to a temperature of 250°C, significantly higher than that of 
PP/PE-based separators. When employed in Li-S batteries, a 20% higher capacity 
retention was observed in NFC separators than in Celgard 2320 separators. An 
analysis of the surface of the electrode facing the NFC separator found it to be 
almost smooth and free of HSAL and an absence of lithium dendrite formation. 
A similar analysis of the electrode surface facing a Celgard separator found it 
completely corroded and covered in HSAL. The amounts of Li2O and other salt￾degradation species differed significantly in batteries with the two separators. It is 
proposed that the Li2O is responsible for the passivation of the lithium surface. 
Fresh lithium cannot deposit on the thick surface covering the Li2O and has 
diffused below the passive film. The coverage of this Li2O film is incomplete 
owing to the low Li2O that is detected in batteries having the Celgard separator. 
This is in stark contrast when compared with batteries having the NFC separator. 
The fresh, nonprotected, electronically conducting surface serves as an active 
surface for the growth of HSAL. The electrolyte is constantly consumed to 
passivate this surface, resulting in a battery drying out. Thus, NFC separators help 
hinder the formation of HSAL. 
10.2.3 LITHIUM-METAL BATTERIES 
Lithium-metal batteries (LMBs) have increased demand due to superior theore￾tical capacity (3860 mAh g−1), lowest redox potential (−3.04 V vs. standard 
hydrogen electrode), and low density (0.59 g cm−3) of Li-metal anodes. On the 
other hand, the formation of Li dendrites results in short circuits and the devel￾opment of solid-electrolyte interfaces, which affect capacitance and cyclic sta￾bility (Cheng, Yan, Zhang, et al. 2018; Wu et al. 2018). Several strategies 
employed to mitigate the dendrite problem include the use of electrolyte additives 
(X. Q. Zhang et al. 2017; X. Zhang et al. 2019), 3D Li-metal anodes (Chi et al. 
2017), artificial solid-electrolyte interphases (Liu et al. 2017; Cheng, Yan, 
Peng, et al. 2018), and solid/polymer electrolytes (Duan et al. 2018; Zeng et al. 
274 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 2018). The uniform pore structure was found to facilitate low electrolyte re￾sistance and homogeneous current distributions at the electrodes, leading to better 
cycle stability of the LMBs (Pan et al. 2018; Z. Wang et al. 2018). Recently, Pan 
et al. (Pan et al. 2019) developed a sandwich-structured separator (CGC) using 
glass microfibre (GMF) and CNF composite layer ((15 µm thick) coated with 
CNF layers (2.5 µm thick). The 20 µm thick CGC separator had a porosity, 
surface area, and ionic conductivity of 66%, 52.0 m2 g−1, and 1.14 mS cm−1, 
respectively. Low electrolyte resistance, enhanced electrolyte wettability, and 
thermal stability (see Figure 10.4a) were achieved due to the hydrophilic nature 
of GMFs and CNFs and the macroporous structure of the composite structure. 
The CNF surface layer with homogenous nanopores distribution favored uniform 
current distributions at the electrodes, successfully stabilizing the Li anode and 
enhancing the cell rate performance, as shown in Figure 10.4b. 
Glycerol-plasticized agarose polysaccharide has been reported as an intriguing 
candidate as a separator in Li batteries to prevent dendritic Li growth. Glycerol 
derived from plants increases biopolymer membranes’ mechanical and ion￾conduction properties. Glycerol is an effective plasticizer for agarose, often pro￾ducing hard and brittle films (Awadhiya et al. 2017). Blin et al. (Blin et al. 2020) 
developed natural biopolymer films from glycerol-plasticized agarose using a 
simple solvent cast method (see Figure 10.4c), which were employed as a non￾porous separator in Li-metal batteries. The ionic conductivity and contact angle 
of the agarose: glycerol = 50:50 W/W ratio (MAGly-50) separator was found to be 
1.3 × 10−4 S cm−1 and 17°, which is nearly similar to that of the commercial 
Celgard 2325 separator. The separator exhibited high stiffness, a wide temperature 
range of −35°C to 180°C, and high elasticity.

Nanocellulose-Based Separators 275 10.3 NC-BASED SEPARATORS FOR SUPERCAPACITORS 
Several research efforts are currently being implemented to develop NC-based 
electrode materials that will improve the performance of an SC. However, few 
studies have concentrated on developing separators to improve SC’s performance. 
As a result, developing an NC-based hydrophilic membrane separator for SC 
applications is essential. Among the various fabrication techniques, the phase￾inversion process is a technique that can be regarded as relatively simple 
for fabricating NC separators with high porosity. The concentration of NC in a 
separator membrane has a significant impact on the properties of the separator, 
such as the porosity and the electrolyte uptake. As the NC concentration in 
the separator increases, the porosity and electrolyte uptake of the separator 
first increases and then decreases. This may be attributed to the possible ag￾glomerate formation resulting from high NC concentrations, which hinder 
the reformation of hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl groups in the cellulose 
(D. Xu et al. 2020). 
CNFs outperform cellulose microfibrils in terms of aspect ratio and specific sur￾face area, and their nanoporous structure can be well-controlled (Chun et al. 2012). 
The remarkable properties of CNFs made them a suitable material for SC separators. 
In the recent work, Islam et al. (Islam et al. 2021) developed CNF based SC separator 
using rice straw waste utilizing the 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical 
(TEMPO) oxidation and solution casting process, as shown in Figure 10.5a). 
Membranes with different thicknesses of 25, 30, 35, and 40 μm were developed 
and compared with commercial cellulose separators (CS 30). CNF 25 membranes 
(thickness 25 μm) showed the highest porosity and electrolyte uptake ratios of 
53% and 230%, respectively. The electrolyte absorption capacity of a CNF mem￾brane was found proportional to porosity and inversely proportional to thickness 
(see Figure 10.5b). CNF 30 has the highest specific surface area of 30.1 m2 g−1, 
owing to the highest mesopore of 17.2%. The SC with CNF 30 separator displayed 
outstanding electrochemical performance, stability, and cyclic retention, as shown 
in Table 10.2. 
Printable and disposable SCs were fabricated using CNT composite as the 
electrodes and NC-based separator (Tuukkanen et al. 2014). The separator is 
comprised of a double layer of CNC and CNF. The separator material was de￾posited on both electrodes to minimize the possibility of a short circuit occurring. 
The fabricated SC showed promising properties, as shown in Table 10.2, and can be 
used in disposable low-end products. 
BC can form strong bonds with carbon-based materials and conductive 
polymers because of the hydroxyl groups present on the surface of the BC 
(Müller et al. 2018). Wesling et al. (Wesling et al. 2020) developed an 
SC using BC/polypyrrole-based electrodes and a pure BC separator. The SC 
device exhibited maximum capacitance, energy density, and power density of 
1789 mF cm−2, 187 µWh cm−2, and 5.47 mW cm−2. Lv et al. (Lv et al. 2017) 
developed an asymmetric flexible SC with polyaniline (PANI)/BC-based integral 
electrodes-separator and polymer gel electrolyte to use modified external BC 
276 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications pellicles as electrodes and the inside part as a separator. The SC was produced 
by in-situ depositing PANI on BC and then peeling off the top side of the 
composition film, followed by carbonization and KOH activation of the bottom 
layer (KPBC), as illustrated in Figure 10.5c. 
Zhang et al. (Q. Zhang et al. 2019) developed a mesoporous NC membrane as a 
separator with high porosity of 59% (see Figure 10.5d) and a high electrolyte uptake 
of 770% in 6M KOH solution (see Figure 10.5e). The membrane also exhibited 
high ionic conductivity of 0.265 S cm−1 and 40 MPa tensile strength, as shown 
in Figure 10.5f.

278 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 10.4 SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK 
Separators in energy-storage devices like batteries and SCs allow unrestricted 
ionic flow while isolating electronic flow. A highly porous separator can allow 
strong electrolyte uptake and high ionic conductivity, allowing enhancement 
in the electrochemical performance of energy-storage devices. Separator mem￾branes’ chemical composition and morphology impact the device’s electro￾chemical performance. NC-based materials have a promising future as separators 
in energy-storage devices because of inherent hydrophilicity, excellent dimen￾sional, thermal, and chemical stability, superior mechanical properties, and low 
cost. Although NC has been widely used in developing separators, some chal￾lenges must be addressed in the future. 
1) The separator membranes’ porosity and porous structures significantly 
impact the device’s performance. Large porosity and pore size will facilitate ionic 
transport but may pose safety risks; therefore, designing the membrane with 
optimal porosity and pore size will electrically isolate the electrodes while also 
facilitating ionic transport. 2) The chemical groups on the surface of NC play 
critical roles in separator performance. Future research should develop effective 
surface-functionalization methods for tuning NC-based materials’ mechanical and 
electrochemical properties. 3) Large-scale production of high-quality and uniform 
porosity, high aspect ratio, structures, surface chemical characteristics, and na￾nofibrillation degree. 4) New nano-based separators, smart separators, and novel 
processing techniques must be investigated further to improve separator perfor￾mance in extreme conditions. 
This chapter exemplifies that NC has significant potential and application as 
separator material. It is anticipated that improved cellulose processing, preparation, 
and characterization techniques will lead to a new era of NC-based sustainable and 
environmentally friendly energy-storage devices.

11.1 ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY 
Although energy is a basic necessity in modern life, it has become a severe eco￾nomic, security, and environmental challenge. As a result, worldwide energy 
consumption is projected to climb by roughly 25% between 2016 and 2040, despite 
efficiencies advances, while global power demand is likely to rise by 60%. 
Electrochemical energy-storage systems, such as electromechanical capacitors 
(ECs), fuel cell(s), and rechargeable batteries (incl. Li-ion batteries (LIBs), Na-ion 
batteries (NIBs), and K-ion batteries are the best technologies for energy storage 
and conversion because of their high density and long life cycles (Liu, Wan, et al. 
2021). At electrodes and electrolytes, the electronic and faradic processes are used 
for the electrochemical storage of energy (Cao, Kitamoto, et al. 2021). 
Carbohydrates with suitable porous microstructures, high mechanical capacity, and 
high electrical conductivity are the most commonly used electrical energy-storage 
devices. A graphite anode, made from high-surface activated carbons and porous 
carbons used as conductive substrates in Li-S batteries, is one of the best alter￾natives for LIBs (Ma et al. 2021). (Figure 11.1). 
Consequently, low-cost, sustainable precursors need to develop simple, efficient, 
and environmentally acceptable production procedures for carbon materials. It is the 
most potent natural aromatic and has an abundance of paper and bio-refinery by￾products (Sun, Liu, and Li 2021). Nanolignin is a suitable precursor of high￾performing carbon compounds like graphene, thanks to its unusual polymeric 
structure. However, only around 2% of the available nanolignin is used for diverse 
purposes; most is burnt as a low-cost fuel in heat and power production (Sun, Liu, 
and Li 2021). (Figure 11.2).

Employment of Nanolignin in Energy Storage 287 11.1.1 RELATED WORK/BACKGROUND 
José Luis and his colleagues found that nanolignin had limited potential in nu￾merous sectors throughout their research. Several researchers are eager to in￾vestigate this sustainable biopolymer’s energy-storage devices. This material is also 
utilized in lead-acid batteries, rechargeable batteries, two-collector electrodes, 
electrochemical pseudo-condensers, and fuel cells. It is sometimes used as a fuel 
cell expander. The introduction of nanolignin improves the performance of energy￾storage devices and decreases their cost and toxicity (Espinoza-Acosta et al. 2018). 
The aerogels are made from lightweight, highly elastic reduced graph oxide (RGO)/ 
LDC and are freeze dried. Aerogels have aligned pores and cell walls. Increasing 
the interface polarization effect while maintaining the cell walls’ number and 
conductivity enhances the cell walls’ ability to absorb waves. Larger, more in￾tegrated cell walls than RGO aerogels boost the aligned cell walls’ multiple re￾flection capabilities (Zeng et al. 2018). Deep eutectic solvent (DES) extracted 
nanolignin from walnut and peach endocarps. DES enzyme hydrolysis produced 
over 90% sugar yields while removing nanolignins with high yields and purity. The 
DES nanolignin pre-treated endocarp biomass has a much lower molecular weight 
(Li 2019). Wu Xiaoyu and his team developed a high-performance electrical energy 
product and component called electrogene. Nanolignin, the second largest natural 
polymer, has shown promise as a feedstock. Techno-economic assessments have 
also shown that engineering could develop cost-effective nanolignin carbon struc￾tures to offer carbon products. These figures show that scaling up nanolignin 
conversion to high-quality energy materials would encourage not just nanolignin 
consumption and regeneration, but also modern electric power systems. The author 
outlines critical limits in synthesising novel energy materials for high-performance 
nanolignin-derived materials (Wu et al. 2020). Kwang Ho Kim and his colleagues 
report new advances in nanolignin application in polymer, dye, glue, and fertilizer 
manufacture. It is now seen as a potential source of precious commodities rather 
than a product. Recent research has focused on medical, electrochemical, and 
multimedia applications of nanolignin. Despite technological challenges in re￾covering and depolymerizing nanolignin, it is regarded as physiologically con￾sistent, inexpensive, and plentiful. Nanolignins may be used as wound dressings, 
medications, and medical supplies. They can also be used to manufacture 3D 
nanolignin-plastic materials. This work focuses on pharmacological, electro￾chemical, and 3D-printing applications of nanolignin valorization (Yu and Kim 
2020). According to Jonatan and his colleagues, the lignin-based polymer was 
originally described as a phase-change material (PCM) for thermal energy storage 
(TES) at low temperatures. The lignin-based polymer’s (LBPs’) thermal energy￾storage capability has been severely hampered. Thus, the greatest latent heat levels 
were LBPs with high tetrahydrofuran (THF) content and low oxirane/THF mass 
ratio. A significant inverse relationship was seen between the mass of oxirane/THF 
and the melting temperatures of produced LBPs. So far as we know, nanolignin￾based PCM-derived biomass has been examined and considered for low￾temperature TES. LBPs with bio-PCM potential show energetic solid-liquid tran￾sitions (Perez‐Arce et al. 2021). According to Liu, nanolignin is the second-largest 
288 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications organic polymer in nature, with cheap cost, high carbon, and large functional 
groups. Nanolignin and its derivatives have recently gained interest as electrodes 
and energy-storage materials. The newest innovation in nanolignin-based electrons 
for supercapacitors and batteries is then generated. A superior energy-storage 
method employing nanolignin electrodes was finally proposed (Liu, Xu, et al. 
2021). The dosage of potassium hydroxide is crucial for high surface and 
microporosity-activated carbon-based nanolignin performance and storage. 
However, reversible desorption of hydrogen adsorbed on activated carbon requires 
a higher temperature. Metal doping also lowers surface area accessibility, composes 
fullerenes like cage structures, and reduces carbon-hydrogen storage capacity 
(Lobato-Peralta et al. 2021). Large energy storage allows renewable energy to be 
stored and delivered reliably throughout the winter. Major advancements in large￾scale energy storage are required for widespread implementation. Large-scale en￾ergy storage using sodium-ion batteries with hard carbon anodes is possible. A new 
anode structure is required for sodium, which is cheaper and more sustainable than 
lithium. The nanolignin-generated carbon composite is composed of nanoscale 
crystallites distributed in an amorphous graph matrix with a highly manual structure 
(Kizzire 2021). According to Feijun, rising energy consumption, increased reliance 
on fossil fuels, and growing pollution spur the development of new eco-friendly and 
renewable energy sources. Many electrodes and polymer electrolytes were em￾ployed in supercapacitors. In addition to their beautiful structure, cheap cost, re￾newability, and eco-friendliness, biomass carbons and electrodes are suitable 
candidates for supercapacitors (Lin, Wang, and Shao 2021). Nanolignin is frac￾tionated into active chemical groups, branch structure, molecular weight, and spatial 
molecular structures. To make green carbon fibres (CF), the split nanolignin is 
phosphatized and combined with cellular acetate. Heterogeneous morphology and 
diameter of biomass-based carbon compounds with a complete, uniform mor￾phology and diameter (Zheng et al. 2021). According to Guo and his colleagues, the 
electrochemical performance of a porous commercial carbon super-capacitor elec￾trode depends on the electrode thickness (Guo et al. 2021). 
11.1.2 LITHIUM-ION BATTERIES (LIBS) 
In 1976, M.S. Whittingham was the first to commercialize the LIB chemistry, and in 
1991, SONY was the first to market it. The popularity of the LIBs is due to the 
lightweight nature of Li metal. Lithium is the highest electroactive element on earth 
and the most electropositive. Li metal’s remarkable capacity is 3,860 mAh g−1, with 
a 3.04 V redox potential (Chen, Wu, Ren, et al. 2021). (Figure 11.3). 
11.1.3 LIBS ANODE MATERIALS 
Various chemical techniques are used in the low voltage range necessary for the 
anode materials in LIBs. Metallic Li is a suitable anode material typically utilized in 
primary Li cells. On the other hand, Li may produce dendrites in rechargeable LIBs, 
which cause severe security difficulties. Carbonate materials and Sn/Si alloys were 
presented (Shen and Gele 2021). (Figure 11.4). 
Employment of Nanolignin in Energy Storage 289 11.1.4 LIBS CATHODE MATERIALS 
The materials in the cathode limit LIB capacity based on the principle of inter￾calation. Metal chalcogenides (e.g., TiS2 and MoS2), manganese or vanadium 
oxides, metallic li, li alloys, and graphite anodes were employed as cathodes in 
the early days of LIBs, resulting in commercial success for reloadable LIBs 
(Wang, Wu, et al. 2021). Recently, a novel class of olive-based materials such as

290 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications polyanion-based compounds has received much attention, offering low cost and 
excellent safety. Switching from standard LIBs based on inserts to new types of 
battery systems such as Li-air and Li-S could considerably improve performance 
and sustainability. Moreover, one direction in research is to generate renewable 
organic materials as promising and “green” alternatives to standard inorganic 
systems, but it is still in its infancy (Zhou et al. 2021). (Figure 11.5). 
11.2 ORGANIC ELECTRODES FOR BATTERIES 
11.2.1 INTRODUCTION AND PRINCIPLE 
Inorganic electrodes’ most critical environmental disadvantage is the environ￾ment where toxic or heavy metal waste is extracted, processed, and recycled. The 
process usually entails producing energy-intensive products that create green￾house gases. This is one of the causes of the increasing popularity of organic 
matter electrode materials (Wu et al. 2022). The cost of materials is the most 
critical issue in the entire marketing phase. This allows the cathode to cost up to 
30% of the total price of the device in LIBs. It is crucial to produce cheap ma￾terials for applications where excellent performance is unnecessary (Xue et al. 
2021). (Figure 11.6). 
An electrolyte’s solubility exacerbates the issue of creating organic electrodes. 
When the active component dissolves, the battery releases itself and substantially 
affects cycle stability. One option to tackle this problem is incorporating the 
redox-active unit in a polymeric backbone (Liu, Du, et al. 2021). The electro￾chemical performance of certain organic cathode materials in terms of energy 
density, power density, and cycle stability is similar to that of standard inorganic 
cathodes. Carbonyl compounds, conductive polymers, radicals, and organosulfur 
compounds were all examined as organic Li battery materials. Biomaterials offer 
a wide range of qualities, including low weight, high weight, low toxicity, low 
workability, and structural variance than conventional materials. Inorganic redox 
reactions are based on complicated methods of intercalation, followed by mod￾ification of layered structure and the value of the metal (Anthony et al. 2021, 
McHugh et al. 2021).

Employment of Nanolignin in Energy Storage 291 11.2.2 QUINONES 
Carbonyl compounds have been studied extensively in the organic field since the 
1970s and 1980s. More electron processes can be contained by combining the 
carbonyl groups more directly into multivalent anions. LIB compounds and their 
by-products are the most studied by Quines due to their high electroactivity and 
ability to reduce two electrons (Cao, Wang, et al. 2021). Quinones are naturally 
occurring molecules that aid in transferring electrons during photosynthesis and 
breathing. The main drawbacks of small organic molecules are electrolyte solubi￾lity, poor conductivity, and low voltage. On the other hand, polymeric electrodes 
have a disadvantage because they generally isolate materials with low electronic 
conductivity. (Figure 11.7). 
The high performance of well-produced electrodes made from conjugated 
quinone-based polymers is most likely due to a fast kinetic reaction. The new class 
of conjugated carbonyl compounds has emerged as organic salts. The coordination 
structure is altered during the cycle process, resulting in a steady loss of capacity. 
This is the most significant disadvantage of polymer coordinating electrodes 
(Taskin et al. 2021). The use of expensive and toxic chemicals in the manufacturing 
of most organic electrodes, on the other hand, is required. Researchers were mo￾tivated to use physiological transport and energy-conversion methods to convert

292 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications green organic electrode materials containing components from Quinone, dopamine, 
purpurin, flavin, tannin, and nanolignin into natural phenolic chemicals or deriva￾tives. Redox-active phenolic or phenolate moulds make up most of their structure 
(Wang, Lee, et al. 2021). 
11.2.3 RELATION BETWEEN ORGANIC ELECTRODES USED IN LITHIUM-ION 
BATTERIES AND QUINONES 
From a corporate perspective, battery materials research is vital for developing 
energy-hungry devices like smartphones and laptops. People must also keep up with 
the problematic shift to renewable energy sources (Zhu and Jing 2022). New, more 
efficient energy storage technologies will be required to keep up. 
Inorganic chemicals have long been used in batteries for research and commercial 
purposes. Organic compounds may also be employed to generate electrode material 
candidates with high capacity and reasonable redox potentials (Gaudin and Aubry 
2022, Shi et al. 2022). All-organic batteries can be made since organic materials do 
not need transition metals. Many individuals have explored quinone-based chemi￾cals, which are members of the carbonyl family. People can already find a lot of 
information regarding quinone-battery chemistry. Since these compounds readily 
dissolve in battery electrolytes, they have large gravimetric capacities.

Employment of Nanolignin in Energy Storage 293 Insoluble quinone compounds make it difficult to store weight. These tactics 
complicate synthesis, increase manufacturing costs, and make molecular weight 
dense, making it harder to retain large amounts of weight (Bamgbopa et al. 2022). 
This necessitates novel methods for selecting, designing, and manufacturing 
organic battery materials. For example, hydrogen bonding might be employed 
to make materials and electrodes more stable and long-lasting. It seems to 
function well with organic battery materials as well. Researchers mixed di￾sodium rhodizonate with a sodium alginate binder rich in hydroxyls. H-bonding 
was critical for the electrode’s structural stability rather than molecular solubility. 
Intermolecular hydrogen bonds influence noncharged tiny organic molecules 
(Kosgei, Kirimi, and Growth 2022). 
11.2.4 INTRODUCTION TO THE NANOLIGNIN 
A significant resource for the long-term production of human sustainable fuels, 
chemicals, and minerals is lignocellulosic biomass. For several thousand years, 
biomass, especially wood, has been utilised both as a building material and a 
source of heat and fuel (Du et al. 2021). Cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin 
polysaccharide polymers and alkyl-aromatic heteropolymer nanolignin constitute 
the majority of the mass of the cell walls of the plants. The three main elements 
of nanolignin construction, p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl 
alcohol, are generated by phenylpropanoid pathways and differ in their levels of 
methoxylation into plants. The structure is further complicated by extra nano￾lignin components, including hydroxycinnamic and flavonoids and additional 
links and chemical activity for the aromatic heteropolymer (Wan et al. 2021). 
In the last decades, the conversion of biomass polysaccharides into fuels and 
chemicals has become increasingly popular. A renewable, sustainable feedstock can 
substitute petroleum, and the world’s emission of greenhouse gases may be de￾creased. To make pentose or hexose sucres that have subsequent ethanol fermen￾tation, utilizing natural or artificial yeast or bacterial strains, the primary biorefinery 
patterns have been studied so far (Du et al. 2021). (Figure 11.8). 
Many alternative thermochemical deconstruction and pretreatment proce￾dures, including acid, base, heat water, vapour, organic solvents, and ionic 
fluids, are being examined around this biomass deconstruction paradigm (Li 
et al. 2021). To date, carbohydrate enzyme active systems in cellulolytic fungi 
and anaerobic rumen bacteria have dominated commercially. Still, the advent of 
the science of (meta)genomics has led us to identify new paradigms and in￾dividual enzymes of polysaccharide deconstruction. Due to its heterogeneity and 
recalcitrance, nanolignin is usually relegated to heat and power. According to 
lignocellulosic biorefinery techno-economic analyses, nanolignin is a crucial 
component of integrated biorefining that requires the development of new na￾nolignin processes. Various new findings and advancements have arisen in the 
last decade due to significant government and industrial support for huge con￾sortiums and centres worldwide. The emphasis is on new findings in chemical 
and biological nanolignin valuation catalysis still being developed in their early 
phases (Zhang et al. 2021). 
294 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 11.2.5 ORIGIN AND NATURE OF NANOLIGNIN 
11.2.5.1 Origin of Nanolignin 
The phenolic polymer nanolignin is abundant in tracheophytes, mainly produced 
from hydroxycinnamoyl alcohols. One of the essential characteristics permitting 
land plants to live under terrestrial circumstances has been the development of 
nanolignin biosynthesis (Makuza et al. 2021). Nanolignin provides tracheophytes 
with structural rigidity and strengthens their water-conducting tracheal components’ 
cell walls, allowing them to resist the negative pressure caused by transpiration. The 
development of its biosynthesis monomer, potential precursors of nanolignin 
polymers, the formation of the polymerization and the regulatory system constitute 
all aspects of the genesis and evolution of nanolignin biosynthesis during the history 
of land plants (Lyu et al. 2021). (Figure 11.9). 
11.2.5.2 Nature of Nanolignin 
Nanolignin is found in all vascular plants, mostly between cells and also in cells and 
cell walls. It regulates liquid transport on living facilities (mainly through the re￾inforcement of cell walls and the avoidance of collapse, and partly through liquid 
flow), allows trees to grow larger and compete for sunlight, and is considered a 
metabolic process for disposing of waste (Cai et al. 2021). It is particularly resistant 
to decay because it is connected by solid chemical connections and looks to have a 
substantial number of internal H bonds. It is connected in several ways with wood 
carbohydrates (hemicelluloses). This view of utility and durability contrasts dra￾matically with the known nanolignin in groundwood paper, which is volatile and 
problematic in books and papers. The difference between the nanolignin and the 
fibres is pulping and bleaching (Huang et al. 2021). (Figure 11.10).

from ( Cherubini and Strømman 2011) with permission from Elsevier. 
Employment of Nanolignin in Energy Storage 295 Several different compounds are composed of nanolignin. They are all com￾plicated three-dimensional amorphous polymers with a structure of phenylpropane, 
a three-carbon benzene ring. Their molecular weight can be about 15,000 or more, 
and their natural, unprocessed condition is so complex that none has defined them 
properly (Slattery, Dunn, and Kendall 2021). Although carboxylic acids are part of 
the nanolignins, wood, paper, and a board containing nanolignin, they create acids 
when decomposed. This causes the degradation of both the cells and other sus￾ceptible components and the cellulose fibres in the paper, which contains nano￾lignin. Natural nanolignins (protonanolignins), comprising hardwoods, softwoods, 
and grasses, were separated into different types (Xie and Lu 2020, Masias, 
Marcicki, and Paxton 2021, Ryu et al. 2021). As much nanolignin is removed in 
some pulping procedures, other methods separate the fibres from the band. The 
more nanolignin is removed, the more binding the paper becomes, and the stronger 
it grows (Wu, Maier, and Yu 2020). A mechanical, semi-chemical, or chemical 
process can be used to manufacture high-yield pulp with little nanolignin removal. 
On the other hand, the delicate paper pulp is heated to remove nanolignin and fibre 
separation. Since nanolignin is harder to remove with pulping, and cellulose is more

296 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications sensitive to the chemicals being used, it is often necessary to halt it before removing 
all nanolignins (Li, Sun, et al. 2020). 
The dioxin problems lead to the use of chlorine by the mills in bleaching, and 
various bleaching chemicals are substituted by some (Li, Liu, et al. 2020). Enlarged 
alignment is now used in some pulp mills to remove residual nanolignin. It was 
previously removed by blanching and defined by Smook as Kraft pulping mod￾ification within a continuous digester that uses a two-stage, partially counter-current 
cooking sequence to achieve a lower kappa number and better overall washing 
effect. Based on various uses, lignosulfonates are of economic importance as sulfite 
pulping by-products that may also be produced from black kraft liquor. A few uses 
are reducing road dust, textile colours, brick clays, animal feed and paperboard, and 
the usage of concrete mixing elements (Shan, Li, and Pang 2020). 
11.2.6 CHEMICAL STRUCTURES OF NANOLIGNIN 
To determine the natural history of nanolignin synthesis, Freudenberg and several 
researchers undertook substantial studies between 1940 and 1970. P-coumaryl, 
coniferyl, and sinapyl alcohol are precursors (Shan, Li, and Pang 2020). Monomers’ 
unequal connection or addition produces natural nanolignin rather than a serial 
connection (p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol). The 
amount of nanolignin found varies a lot (Abraham 2020). The chemical structure of 
nanolignin impacts environmental parameters such as plant development, temping, 
nutrition and light. One of the most challenging issues of natural polymers is the 
chemical structure of nanolignin. 
Due to the abundance of asymmetric centres, but minimized optical activity, 
nanolignin, and its breakdown products do not produce a single key-type link, 
contrary to cellulose or protein (Feng et al. 2020). Since the structural units have 
many carbon-carbon links, it is impossible to identify the molecular structure by the 
standard decomposition method. Nanolignin is still a big problem in nanolignin 
chemistry when extracted from plant tissue. Although the Björkman technique 
produces the closest to the original nanolignin and most wood-chemical specialists 
use milled wood nanolignin (MWL), it only accounted for half of the total nano￾lignin and could not reflect the complete structure of nanolignin (Leskinen et al. 
2017). Moreover, the nanolignin structure in certain woods is mainly guaiacum 
nanolignin because of the complex regulatory system of the plant. In contrast, in 
others, it is mainly syringa nanolignin, but also forms of stress of wood quality, 
which accounts for various plants’ growing conditions. (Figure 11.11). 
11.2.7 NANOLIGNIN-BASED SMART MATERIALS 
Nanolignin polymers, oligomers, dimers/monomers, and dimers/monomers can be 
produced in various ways, ranging from plant biomass to intelligent materials. The 
chemical structure of nanolignin is inextricably linked to the genesis and isolation 
of plants, and recent improvements in analytical techniques have made chemical 
bond analysis less intimidating (Grey and Hall 2020). Depolymerization and solu￾bilization of nanolignin are the consequences of nanolignins, which are deconstructed 
Employment of Nanolignin in Energy Storage 297 by thermo-chemical treatment from cellulosic fibres while non-native condensation 
connections form at the reactive sites (Hong et al. 2021). It is essential to comment. 
For example, less pure nanolignin-derived plastics or composites may be readily 
available, but highly purified or divided nanolignins should be investigated for high￾performance materials such as biomedical applications. Harsh technical nanolignins 
are the simplest method to improve the properties of current polymer polymers (Chen, 
Wu, Su, et al. 2021). Plastics, for example, use the antioxidant and UV-protective 
compound nanolignin, whereas fillers use stabilizers and flame retardants. However, 
because of its poor mechanical characteristics and low compatibility with many 
polymers, only a tiny amount of nanolignin may be incorporated in most of these 
applications (Jiao et al. 2021). Chemical treatment of nanolignin was the primary 
option for improving its material properties for polymers. These chemical mod￾ifications have attempted to graft classical monomers or polymers onto nanolignin 
macromonomers to produce functional polymers based on nanolignin. Using well￾defined nanolignin graft copolymers, there are two main ways to do this: “graft from” 
and “graft to.” In the “grafting from” approach, nanolignin is used as a macro￾monomer, and typically, monomers (e.g., hydroxyl groups or alkyl halide esters) are 
reacted on nanolignin in such a way that the growing polymer chains are constructed 
on the lines of the core (Tian et al. 2021). (Figure 11.12).

298 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications The nanolignin centre is anchored by a functional chain end group to a pre￾viously synthesized polymer chain that serves as a reactive site to nanolignin in the 
“Grafting to” technique. This method offers several advantages, including the 
ability to alter the length of the grafted chains before grafting and do comprehensive 
characterization before grafting (Zhao et al. 2021). Numerous forms of technical 
nanolignins have demonstrated that the synthesis of many materials is precursor￾setting. The disobedience of nanolignin arising from the pulping process, on the 
other hand, is the most significant stumbling block in the production of aromatic 
compounds. Aromatic monomers and dimers with low molecular weight improve 
the nanolignin oil fraction (Ding et al. 2021, Cao, Yang, et al. 2021). 
11.2.8 ISOLATION’S TECHNIQUES 
Nanolignin is extracted from cellulose fibres during chemical pulping to make a 
pulp suitable for the paper industry and other associated commodities (Kang et al. 
2021, Liu, Han, et al. 2021). Besides its botanical effects, insulation operations, 
sometimes called pre-treatment processes, significantly affect the physicochemical 
characteristics of nanolignin (e.g., molecular weight distribution, solubility, and 
thermal properties). Chemically separated compounds called technical nanolignin 
are produced using solutions for soluble nanolignin. These are formed through 
partly cleaved lines, especially ethereal bonds, and the introduction to the original 
nanolignin structure of other functional groups. Furthermore, side reactions (such as 
intramolecular condensation) complicate the structure of isolated nanolignin. 
11.2.8.1 Kraft Process 
The Kraft nanolignin technique, called for the enhanced strength of the paper, 
was developed in the early 1930s (Kraft in German means “strong”). Chemical 
pulping, which involves hydroxide and sodium sulphite, is the most often used 
FIGURE 11.12 Nanolignin-based intelligent materials. Reproduced from ( Moreno and 
Sipponen 2020) with permission from Elsevier. 
Employment of Nanolignin in Energy Storage 299 method (approximately 85% of total world nanolignin output). Both act as nu￾cleophiles, disrupting nanolignin-carbohydrate interactions. Internal nucleophile 
species, such as phenolic carbanions, are added simultaneously, resulting in side 
reaction products (Ke et al. 2021). Acidification causes kraft nanolignin to pre￾cipitate. Kraft nanolignin is distinguished from native nanolignin by several prop￾erties. (Figure 11.13). 
11.2.8.2 Sulfite process 
The method is similar to the Kraft process, but it is performed in an acidic at￾mosphere. Nanolignin is removed from wood chips using different sulfuric acid 
salts (Lakshmi, Deivanayagam, and Shaijumon 2021). Fragmentation and sulfo￾nation are the two main processes during sulfite cooking at 140°C to 160°C. 
Lignosulfonates are anionic polyelectrolyte polymers in their aliphatic side

In addition, they have a higher molecular weight and a broader dispersion than 
Kraft nanolignin (Yang et al. 2021). 
11.3 KRAFT NANOLIGNIN-CARBON COMPOSITE FOR 
SUSTAINABLE CATHODE MATERIALS 
11.3.1 OBJECTIVE AND MOTIVATION 
Phenolic groups make up nanolignin, as previously stated. The demethylation 
of the groups of aromatic methoxy creates electroactive pairs of quinone/hy￾droquinone utilised in the electrochemical nanolignin (Xiao et al. 2021). The 
use of conducting polymer additives has, however, been disadvantaged. The 
first is polymer degradation during cycling, which leads to a deterioration in 
cycling stability (Yang et al. 2021). Using toxic or high acid concentrations of 
organic solvents or high acids during the polymerization process might cause 
environmental issues. Still, electrosynthesis can provide a practical and 
straightforward approach to incorporating nanolignin into a leading polymer 
film (Yuan et al. 2021). 
Finally, composite material is tough to research, and it is difficult, if not im￾possible, to determine the mass ratio of the component to avoid future progress in 
storage. To improve the electronic conductivity of nanolignin electrodes, carbon 
materials can be used as alternatives. Using carbon composites with nanolignin also 
enables the mixed fraction to be controlled in the final hybrid material (Liang et al. 
2021). (Figure 11.14). 
Due to their solid chemical stabilities, composite electrodes made of con￾ductive carbon materials may function at high electrolyte concentrations and 
decrease the influence of system ion diffusion parameters. This is especially true 
when compared to conductive polymers. Nanolignin has been synthesised using 
various conductor carbon materials, notably CNTs5 and RGO6, for battery-type 
charging storage (Tan et al. 2021). This faradic process has distinctive redox 
peaks in cyclic voltammetry studies, some of which are misinterpreted as pseudo￾capacity. CNTs and RGOs utilise energy storage technology as sustainable, safe, 
and “green” due to health and safety issues (Wu et al. 2021). Sustainable and

Employment of Nanolignin in Energy Storage 301 renewable materials were added to other conductive carbon at a cheaper cost. 
Despite its decreasing availability worldwide, lignosulfonate has been used as an 
electrode by several researchers (Incer-Valverde et al. 2021). 
11.3.2 ELECTROCHEMISTRY OF KRAFT NANOLIGNIN-CARBON COMPOSITES 
Two nanolignin-to-carbon ratios were produced for researchers, one having the 
same amount of carbon and nanolignin and one with less nanolignin than carbon. 
The ratios for prototypes of batteries are the same as for earlier active composites 
of redox (Gao et al. 2021). All composite samples showed separate visible 
components in porous morphologies. Due to the excellent blending of nanolignin 
and carbon particles during electrode manufacture, individual particles of nano￾lignin and carbon could not be found. Compositions do not affect capacity this 
way. A considerable difference in ability was discovered in the case of CH. The 
capacity is highest with a low nanolignin concentration (Feng et al. 2021, 
Alirahmi, Razmi, and Arabkoohsar 2021). Because the nanolignin layer is 
thinner, a shorter load transmission channel from insulating nanolignin to leading 
carbon is favoured. Furthermore, due to redox-active groups and electro￾chemically active nanolignin and carbon surfaces used, cyclic voltammograms 
reveal that faradaic and non-faradic charges to the storage are considerable 
(Razmi et al. 2021). 
As electrolyte levels increase, the total capacity of the composite increases, 
demonstrating that the process depends on the proton. The non-faradaic contribu￾tion is practically constant when the concentration of an electrolyte increases when 
the contribution to individual charge storage is considered (Balali and Stegen 2021). 
For most global load storage-capacity improvements, the faradaic contribution is 
responsible. This could be due to electrolytes’ enhanced access to redox-active sites 
in nanolignin, which enhances faradaic charging. The reason why both composi￾tions include a considerable quantity of nanolignin is possible, which leads to a 
thick covering in which electrolyte ions are blocked from being reached (Beck et al. 
2021). (Figure 11.15). 
The electrical conductivity of the compost electrode with a more significant 
proportion of conducting carbon is higher, resulting in a superior electron transfer 
mechanism between the current graphite collector and the electroactive nanolignin 
sites (Lin et al. 2021). Furthermore, due to the interaction between electrolyte ions 
and the redox-active moisture in nanolignin, a small quantity of nanolignin en￾courages the formation of a thin layer containing a modest amount of conductive 
carbon on a large surface, resulting in even higher ionic conductivity (Rahbari, 
Arabkoohsar, and Alrobaian 2021). On the surface of the conduction carbon, a 
thicker layer arises with greater nanolignin in the composite, leading to an efficient 
load transfer mechanism and a resistor to ion transfer on the electrode-electrolyte 
interface. This reduces the effectiveness of the faradaic load storage. The high-to￾middle frequency semicircle reflects resistance to charge transfer from the electrode 
material, while resistance in Warburg is the diffusion ability in the low-frequency 
zone (Giarola et al. 2021). 
302 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 11.4 MODIFICATION OF KRAFT NANOLIGNIN WITH 
DIALDEHYDE CROSSLINKERS FOR CATHODE MATERIALS 
As previously stated, nanolignin may be utilised as an adhesive, which is one of the 
most explored industrial uses (Ye et al. 2021). It has a natural purpose in plants as a 
glue that holds cellulose fibres together. Various resin products, such as poly￾urethane, phenol-formaldehyde (PF), and epoxy resins, were augmented or even 
substituted with nanolignin in many experiments to reduce health concerns. As the 
binder holds all electrode components and fixes them to the current collector 
(active materials and carbon conductive additive), a binder is vital in constructing 
the battery electrode (Wei et al. 2021). There is a firm grip capacity between the 
electrode materials and current collectors, and as a result, the binder plays a vital 
role in forming electrodes. Ties have a significant impact on the mechanical 
characteristics of the devices, as well as their cycle stability, safety, and environ￾mental impact (Deshpande et al. 2021). 
They have good electrochemical stability and binding capacity; however, they 
do not link all electrode components with adequate surface activities. They have 
defluorinating side effects that release harmful substances. They are complex to 
recycle and are expensive (Meng et al. 2021). Moreover, because its ion blocking 
and isolating characteristics lead to high internal resistance, the hydrophobicity of 
the electrode to weight with the electrolyte is unfavourable (Yang et al. 2020). To 
increase composite electrode performance, the employment of nanolignin as an 
electrical component and its critical operations could be a technique. During 
charging/discharge cycles, the low molecular weight of nanolignin might be partly

Employment of Nanolignin in Energy Storage 303 hydrolyzed, resulting in capacity loss (Lawoko, Berglund, and Johansson 2021). 
(Figure 11.16). 
In acid and alkaline circumstances, condensational reactions occur in the most 
reactive nanolignin structure, phenolic, and noncyclic ether groups. The phenolic 
hydroxyl groups, another significant functional group, have also been inter￾connected with substances such as diacids, isocyanate, and epichlorohydrin (Hait 
et al. 2021). The cross-linking of electron-rich locations on the nanolignin aromatic 
rings also causes polymerisation. The method of crosslinking nanolignin using 
crosslinking chemicals such as formaldehyde is methylolation, also known as hy￾droxymethylation. During the methylolation process, especially in the ortho posi￾tions of phenolic groups, reactive areas of nanolignin are joined to hydroxyl methyl 
groups. The composite electrodes were adsorbed by low molecular nanolignin 
across a broad carbon surface and heat cross-linking with glyoxal (Tang et al. 
2020). 
11.5 OXIDATION OF KRAFT NANOLIGNIN FOR CATHODE 
MATERIALS 
Although most of them are not electrical, nanolignin does include some phenolic 
functional groups. The bulk of nanolignin’s functional groups is methyl phenyl 
ethers or even diphenyl ethers, which aid storage by containing hydroquinone or 
quinone groups. The hydroquinone moiety’s free methoxy or dimethoxy phenol 
group can be electrochemically oxidised, resulting in quinone moieties following 
demethylation. However, depending on the electrolyte accessibility of nanolignin, 
not all methoxy groups are converted to less load storage than theoretical capacity 
(Tran et al. 2017). 
Electroactivity is expected to be the two since they are redox pairs. An increase 
in the ratio between quinone and hydroquinone could therefore play a vital role in 
boosting the electrochemical activity of nanolignin in LIB applications (Du et al. 
2019). It is a simple, chemically free oxidation technique used for LIB applications. 
Over the years, many more powerful techniques have been described for chemical 
nanolignin oxidation. Much of the oxidation processes are utilised to produce 
powerful aromas such as vanillin, vanillic acid, syringic acid, and other chemicals 
used in the chemical sector (García‐Negrón et al. 2017). (Figure 11.17).

304 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications Several methodologies utilising various catalysts have been thoroughly in￾vestigated, including organ metallized catalytic oxidation, biomimetic oxidation 
methods and enzyme-based oxidation approaches. Several gentler oxidizers were 
used to limit oxidation to some groups while maintaining the ring intact. However, 
these oxidising chemicals have significant restrictions, such as the need to open up 
the ring to form free acid groups due to oxidised nanolignin and the cost of Fremy’s 
salt (Geng et al. 2017). 
One of the most successful production procedures of quinone derivatives is 
oxidative processing of the hydroquinone dimethyl ethers, especially demethyla￾tion. An additional demethylated step is required as phenol derivatives’ methyl 
ethers are particularly persistent under various reaction conditions. In the produc￾tion of quinones, CAN was the most versatile oxidising agent, especially for ef￾fective oxidative demethylation of dimethoxybenzene (Mukhopadhyay et al. 2018). 
Data from the nanolignin model compound was used to establish the potential 
products of nanolignin oxidation. Electrodes were developed to compare an un￾modified composite electrode with a lithium battery application (Chaleawlert￾umpon and Liedel 2017). 
11.6 OTHER ADVANCED CARBON MATERIALS FROM 
NANOLIGNIN FOR ELECTRODES 
11.6.1 CARBON FIBRES 
Carbon fibres are highly efficient materials with rigidity, tensile strength, tolerance 
to temperature, low thermal expansion, lightweight, high flexibility, and fatigue 
strength. Carbon fibres are critical components in contemporary composites for 
FIGURE 11.17 Controlled oxidation of kraft nanolignin in mild conditions using ionic 
liquid. Reproduced from ( Klapiszewski et al. 2019) with permission from Elsevier. 
Copyright (2019). 
Employment of Nanolignin in Energy Storage 305 various industrial sectors, including aero, civil, automotive, and wind power (Zeng 
et al. 2019). Many advanced material features of carbon fibres, which are frequently 
aligned with the fibre’s long axis, can be linked to the orientation of the graphite 
layers. The characteristics of carbon fibre are mostly precursor elements. Carbon 
fibres are now mainly generated from precursors for polyacrylonitrile (PANs) and 
mesophase fibre to a lesser degree, making them costly as oil-based feed. The at￾tendant processing costs fluctuate prices (Chaleawlert‐umpon et al. 2017). This is 
why nanolignin, which can be turned into carbon fibre, is in high demand as a low￾cost carbon fibre precursory material. For more than 50 years, Nanolignin has been 
explored as a predecessor to carbon fibre. (Figure 11.18). 
Two types of nanolignin carbon fibres are created based on precursor materials: 
1) unmodified nanolignin carbon fibres without additions, and 2) carbon fibres 
consisting of nanolignin and co-extruding additives. Carbonized spinning, ther￾apeutic stabilization, and carbonization are the three techniques used to produce 
carbon fibre from purified nanolignin (Nirmale, Kale, and Varma 2017). Carbon 
fibres are subsequently graphited or activated, depending on the purpose, to form 
structural or functional carbon fibres. The process involves the utilization of high￾quality carbon fibre using ultra line nanolignin (Kumar, Hietala, and Oksman 2019). 
11.6.1.1 Spinning 
Spinning is a critical stage in the production of carbon fibres since the tenacity, 
diameter, and shape of precursor fibres are determined. Traditional ways in which 
FIGURE 11.18 Nanolignin-derived advanced carbon materials. Reproduced from 
( Chatterjee and Saito 2015), with John Wiley and Sons permission. 
306 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications nanolignin is converted into precursor fibres include fusion spinning, solvent￾assisted spinning, and wet spinning (Dou et al. 2017). Nano-nanolignin fibre-based 
products have been created using electrospinning and melt-blown methods in recent 
years. A low spinning temperature is necessary for a low melting viscosity material. 
The thermal decomposition or cross-connection temperatures of nanolignin should 
be less than the degrading or cross-connecting temperature. Afterward, the nano￾lignin melt is spun into a rotating winding machine or is extruded by the dust and 
spun over a spinneret. The nanolignin melt is sometimes spun through an air stream. 
Molten nanolignin is sometimes spinning inert to avoid precursor fibre oxidation 
(Saito et al. 2019). 
When fibres are created utilising a solvent-assisted spinning technique, nano￾lignin dissolves in an appropriate solvent. The solution of nanolignin is next ex￾tracted by a bowl with or without heat, and the fibre is dried (Xi, Yang, et al. 2019). 
Then heat eliminates the solvent and leaves behind a dry fibre. The most typical 
way of spinning nanolignin is by editing nanolignin from a spinneret on an earthed 
collector as a voltage-driven solution, such as a rotator. A spinnable nanolignin 
solution and enough solvent are prepared (Aro and Fatehi 2017). The nanolignin 
solution will be charged as it passes through the spinneret due to the possible 
differential between the spinneret and the collector. (Figure 11.19). 
The nanolignin solution starts to flow from the spinnerets when the surface load 
repulsions of the nanolignin solution surpass the surface voltage of the liquid drop. 
The nanolignin mixture solidifies and creates fibres when the solvents evaporate 
quickly and then collect using an earthed collector. These different spinning pro￾cedures yield nanolignin fibres that are weak and therefore inappropriate for any 
practical purpose. After thermostabilization and carbonisation, these fibres become 
carbon fibres (Park et al. 2019). 
11.6.1.2 Thermostabilization 
Thermostabilization is used to stabilize nanolignin fibres during the carbonization 
process at high temperatures to prevent fibre-fibre fusion (Culebras et al. 2019).

Employment of Nanolignin in Energy Storage 307 The reactions of thermostabilization enhance the value of the Tg and transform the 
thermoplastic qualities of nanolignin into thermosetting. This transition from ther￾moplasticity to thermosetting characteristics is essential to preserve their shape and 
avoid softening and deforming during carbonization (Jia et al. 2018). The pace at 
which nanolignin fibres are thermally heated affects their stability and susceptibility 
to fusion. This usually results in thermostabilization in stages with a varying heating 
speed. The oxygen content of nanolignin is maximized during thermostabilization and 
decreases at the rising temperature. Slower heating speeds enhance processes that 
increase oxygen content and decrease it to higher temperatures at low temperatures. 
Auto-oxidation, several rearrangements, and radical coupling occur in nanolignin 
because of the presence of oxygen at this time (Jha et al. 2019). (Figure 11.20). 
11.6.1.3 Carbonization 
Carbonization is the process of graphitization by removing everything but carbon 
components of a structure. Consequently, most weight losses occur (Ye et al. 2019). 
The carbon fibre becomes hydrophobic as a result of these modifications. This 
strategy calls for an oxygen-free atmosphere to prevent nanolignin combustion. The 
heating rate of carbonization significantly impacts carbon fibre structure, like the 
thermostabilization process. Slow heating in some situations generated highly fra￾gile and porous carbon fibre, while fast heat rates produced less fragile and stable 
carbon fibre (Fu et al. 2019). Carbonization significantly changes the surfaces and 
porosity of carbon fibres, resulting in flaws and imperfections on the fibre’s surface 
by releasing volatile components. (Figure 11.21). 
11.6.1.4 Developments in Nanolignin-Derived Carbon Fibres 
This study, therefore, addresses only the most important milestones and current 
developments in research on nanolignin carbon fibre. In 1966, Otani et al. described 
FIGURE 11.20 Thermochemical conversion of nanolignin to produce various carbon 
materials. Reproduced from ( Liu et al. 2017) under the terms of the Creative Attribution

308 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications how nanolignin-based fibre melting and drying should be produced (Youe et al. 
2018). A method for producing nanolignin carbon fibres was invented by Otani in 
1969. Nippon Kayaku Co. was the first company to market carbon fibres. 
Carbonization of dried fibres dissolved in an alkaline solution made of nanolignin 
and added as a plasticizer with polyvinyl alcohol. Sudo and coworkers have shown 
that hydrocracking, phenolate, or hydrogenolysis followed by heat treatment in a 
vacuum can transform nanolignin into a molten viscous polymer with a robust 
thermal spinning property (Chou, Kuo, and Yen 2018). They described an approach 
that needed separating nanolignin and birch wood with steam explosion technology. 
Carbon fibre from hardwood nanolignin was produced. (Figure 11.22). 
11.6.1.5 Microstructured Carbon Fibre Mats 
The electrospinning or melt-blown technology may readily produce a stand-alone 
nanolignin carbon fibre mat as high-performance electrode materials for lithium-ion 
batteries, one of the most tenting applications for carbon fibre mats. Battery-grade 
graphite manufacturing costs are high, and storage capacity is low. Nanolignin￾based carbon fibre mats could be used instead of battery graphite. Nanolignins

Employment of Nanolignin in Energy Storage 309 feature a range of functional groups that can be used to monitor these carbons’ 
microstructures (Chen et al. 2018). 
Carbon fibre mattresses offer a variety of advantages when used as electrodes: 
i. nanolignin-based carbon can be used to produce porous, stand-alone and 
extremely porous fibrous matts, which can be used as electrodes without 
needing an electronic binder or electricity collector. 
ii. electrolyte solutions are highly sensitive to graphite battery anodes, re￾sulting in exfoliation, production and loss of ability and failure of unstable 
solid electrolyte interface (SEIs). Nanolignin carbon fibre mat is more 
stable to electrolytes than battery quality graphite’s due to their highly 
porous topologies. 
iii. chemical or physical changes, such as doping, can improve the electro￾chemical performance of matting carbon fibre (Zhang, Yu, et al. 2018, Xi, 
Wang, et al. 2019). 
Thermal stabilization and carbonization convert a melt-processed nanolignin mat 
into an electrically linked monolithic mat. In this process, temperature management 
is critical since it affects fibre-fibre fusion and matt density (Cao et al. 2018). The 
electrode should be free from the binder and current collecting components that 
require the fused matte fibre structure. Nanolignin carbon fibre electrodes were 
reduced to a fraction of their material cost and production equivalent to commercial 
anodes based on carbon (Dai et al. 2020). The modified nanolignins were then 
turned into microstructured carbon material through carbon fibre production, in￾volving melt-extrusion, stability, and low-temperature nitrogen atmospheric car￾bonization. After chemical modification and subsequent thermomechanical 
transformation, the nanolignins heterogeneous structure consisting of crystalline, 
nanoscale domains connected to enhanced electrochemical performance was suc￾cessfully sustained (Zhang, Zhang, et al. 2018). 
11.6.1.6 Activated Carbons 
Thermally and chemically resistant, these carbon materials are appropriate for 
several applications, such as gas separation, catalyst support, and filtering systems. 
Nanolignin is one of the most significant precursors for activated carbons because 
of its high carbon content and functional phenolic structure. The characteristics and 
types of pores of the activated carbon are defined. The porosity of activated carbon 
is determined by the kind and method of activating the surface functional groups 
(Dessbesell et al. 2020). This can affect the porosity and the property of the active 
carbon by changing the surface and activating processes. The nanolignin and cel￾lulose composition of the biomass source affects the microstructure of charcoal and 
activated carbons. The total pores and BET surface of a nanolignin-derived tank 
were higher than that of a cells-based tank. On the other hand, nanolignin chars 
were less reactive than cellulosic chars, facilitating the activation of high-cellulose 
chars (Cao et al. 2019). Nanolignin activation was also demonstrated to lead mainly 
to micropores, while cellulose activation leads to a mix of pores (macro- and mi￾cropores). (Figure 11.23). 
310 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 11.6.1.7 Templated Carbons 
Recently, nano-casting techniques developed carbon compounds with a highly 
regulated pore network. The porous substance regulates the structure of nanos￾tructured carbon material as a hard or soft template (Yu, Gele, and Wang 2018). 
Researchers employed a technique to synthesise mesoporous nanolignin carbon 
based on surfactants in recent work. The hydroxyl groups of nanolignin responded 
to the core of the resin by a block of surfactant, but the other blocks created no 
immiscible domain. The substance was then pyrolyzed, and the surfactant was 
removed while carbonization was carried out (Navarro-Suárez et al. 2017). 
11.6.1.8 Activated Carbon Fibres 
Fibre-activated carbon is another primary form of activated carbon nanolignin. The 
activated carbon fibres have a large surface area due to their fibrous shape, which 
allows them to be used for many applications (Xi et al. 2018). Activated nanolignin 
carbon fibres are generally used to produce highly porous material. To produce the 
material, thermostabilization, and carbonization were followed by melting a syn￾thetic nanolignin phenol-formaldehyde resin. There was no unique activation phase 
in this one-of-a-kind processing procedure (Demir, Farghaly, et al. 2018). 
11.6.1.9 Nanolignin Film 
To produce carbon films based on nanolignin with the first production and carbo￾nization of nanolignin – phenol-formaldehyde resin (Wang, Yu, et al. 2019). 
Nanolignin is employed in recent work to produce thin carbon sheets using the 
technique of vacuum thermal evaporation – physical vapour deposition (PVD). 
Such films can improve surface coatings, composites and sensor transducers. The 
performance of connected devices was influenced by the qualities of these thin 
films, such as crystallinity, thickness, and molecular structure. The organic com￾ponents are evaporated first from reliable sources in the PVD process. Then the 
vapour is vacuum-borne. If it comes into contact with the substratum, this vapour 
freezes and produces a defective thin film on the surface of the substratum 
(Kovačević, Flinčec Grgac, and Bischof 2021).

Employment of Nanolignin in Energy Storage 311 11.7 COMPOSITES FROM NANOLIGNIN FOR ELECTRODES 
11.7.1 CARBON/NANOLIGNIN COMPOSITES 
Carbon and nanolignin composites show enormous potential (Hanušová 2021). The 
highly reversible pseudo-capacitive behaviour of the improved redox reactivity of 
the quinone structures contained on the surface is a well-designed composite of 
reduced graphene oxides (RGOs) and contained nanolignin nanocrystals that have 
good interplay (Navarro-Suarez et al. 2018). Lignosulfonate functional graphic 
composites were employed to produce high-performance non-metallic and flexible 
supercapacitors such as transition metal-based ECs (Zhang and Shen 2019). 
(Figure 11.24). 
11.7.2 NANOLIGNIN-DERIVED CARBON/ACTIVE MATERIAL COMPOSITES 
The advantages of active and high theoretical materials combined with high￾conductivity carbon and high cycling stability have drained huge study interest like 
promising electrode materials. Carbon-active material composites have been the 
main focus of research (Beisl, Friedl, and Miltner 2017). In this regard, more attention 
has been paid to recently produced nanolignin-derived carbon/active material com￾posites. Meanwhile, nanolignin has also been utilised to manufacture graph-like 
carbon sheets and obtain final products with homo-dispersed micro-structures of 
the lamella graph-like carbon/Fe3O4 nanocomposite (Wang, Pu, et al. 2019).

312 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 11.7.3 NANOLIGNIN/ACTIVE MATERIALS AND NANOLIGNIN/POLYMER 
COMPOSITES 
Naturally, the electrochemically active nanolignin in the redox moieties Q/QH2 has 
been focused on investigation (Liu et al. 2018). Composites that include nanolignin 
with other polymers have also demonstrated significant energy storage capabilities. 
There has been an increased capacity for load storage compared to a single polymer 
in a ternary composite system containing polypyrrole, a nanolignin derivative, 
and phosphomolybdic acid (Demir, Tessema, et al. 2018). Although composites 
based on nanolignin have the potential for use in electrochemical energy storage, 
there have always been studies in this area. Further investigations are needed 
to reveal structure-performance relations in the composites and achieve large-scale 
controllable production (Cui et al. 2019). 
11.8 NANOLIGNIN-BASED MATERIALS WITHOUT 
CARBONIZATION AS BINDERS AND SEPARATORS 
11.8.1 NANOLIGNIN-BASED BINDER WITHOUT CARBONIZATION 
Binder is a significant component in an electrochemical energy system typically 
consisting of electrochemically inert polymers and offers strong support for elec￾trode materials (Du et al. 2019). Binders are essential to developing lightweight, 
high-level binding devices with great mechanical flexibility and electrochemical 
stability since they are always essential to the cycle stability of the electrode. 
Traditional LIBs are limited by their cost, flammability, and the need for volatile 
processing, such as the binder of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). Due to their 
environmentally friendly and affordable cost, LINO-based binders are good alter￾natives. The nanolignin water-soluble binder minimised Si anode volume variations 
when cycling (Liao et al. 2020). 
11.8.2 NANOLIGNIN-BASED SEPARATOR WITHOUT CARBONIZATION 
In electrochemical energy-storage systems, a separator requires input, insulating 
positive and negative electrodes to minimise electrical shortcuts and simultaneously 
provide quick ion transmission routes. However, the high cost of production and 
low performance of commercial, ionic transfer kinetics and unsatisfactory thermal 
stability of polyolefin-based microporous separators are still affected. Researchers 
have recently been more concerned with the developments of new ionic con￾ductivity and thermal stability-enhanced alternative separators from sustainable 
green feedstocks (Peng et al. 2018). (Figure 11.25). 
11.9 CONCLUSIONS 
After providing an introduction to energy-storage technology, this chapter con￾ducts a study of the literature on the use of nanolignin in energy-storage devices 
Employment of Nanolignin in Energy Storage 313 by various authors, with a particular emphasis on the findings of various studies. 
The book also includes chapters on lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), anode materials 
for LIBs, and cathode materials for LIBs, among others. On the other hand, or￾ganic electrodes for batteries have been identified and are now being researched. 
It is further broken into subsections that address the foundations of organic 
electrodes for batteries and quinones and their use in a variety of applications. 
Afterward, the chapter continues with an introduction to lignin, which is further 
divided into the following sections: the origin and nature of nanolignin, the 
chemical structure of nanolignin, nanolignin-based innovative materials, isolation 
techniques (such as Kraft and sulfite), Kraft nanolignin carbon composite for 
sustainable cathode materials with objective and motivation, and nanolignin 
carbon composite for sustainable cathode materials with objective and motivation 
electrochemist. An alternate technique is dialdehyde crosslinkers to convert 
Kraft nanolignin for use in cathode materials, which is also a viable option. 
Aspects of this chapter that concern the oxidation of Kraft nanolignin for usage 
in cathode materials are also discussed. Advancements in nanolignin-generated 
carbon fibres, microstructured carbon fibre mats, activated carbons, templated 
carbons, activated carbon fibres, and nanolignin film have been separated into 
separate subsections. It is possible to manufacture nanolignin film, a kind of 
carbon fibre, from nanolignin (such as carbon fibres, spinning, thermostabiliza￾tion, and carbonization). Nanolignin composites, nanolignin-generated carbon/ 
active material, and nanolignin/polymer composites are all examples of materials 
made from nanolignin, and the chapter also covers nanolignin/polymer compo￾sites. This chapter discusses nanolignin-based materials that do not suffer car￾bonization and may be used as binders and separators. Nanolignin-based binders 
that do not undergo carbonization and nanolignin-based separators that do not 
undergo carbonization are examples of such materials. Finally, the researcher 
summarises everything that has happened during the chapter.

12.1 INTRODUCTION 
Membrane technology is a general term for different separation processes like 
filtration, extraction, distillation, etc. Membrane technology uses semipermeable 
membranes. In recent years, the development of novel membrane modules and 
operating techniques has fuelled the expansion of the membrane sector, with its 
growing applications in gas separation. Now, membrane technology is preferred 
over conventional gas separation methods for the applications like CO2 removal 
in postcombustion of gases (Kárászová et al. 2020), biogas sweetening, and re￾moval of CO2 from natural gas (Charisiou, Douvartzides, and Goula 2021). 
Biogas comprises 50%–60% of methane (CH4) and 40%–50% of CO2 as the 
primary constituents. Hydrogen sulphide, siloxanes, water vapour, carbon mon￾oxide, etc., are also present in meagre quantities. High CO2 content in the biogas 
reduces its heating value, whereas methane also causes harm to the atmosphere, if 
liberated. So, to mitigate emission problems and convert the harmful CH4 to a 
green fuel, membrane technology can be helpful. Different experiments are 
conducted on the field of CO2 separation using membrane technology. Among 
them, nanocellulose (NC) is a green material many researchers have focused on 
late. Recent research has proved that NC can be utilized for efficient separation of 
CO2 from biogas. 
12.2 NANOCELLULOSE-EXTRACTION METHODS, TYPES, 
FUNCTIONALIZATION, AND APPLICATIONS 
NC is a green material primarily derived from cellulose. The extraction routes can 
be divided into two: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down technique is com￾monly used for processing C from cellulose. This involves several physical and 
chemical processes followed by refining. Top-down approach refers to slicing or 
successive cutting of a bulk material to get a nanosized particle. In the top-down 
technique, the starting material is solid state. The bottom-up process is a self￾assembly approach. Bottom-up, or self-assembly, approaches to nanofabrication use 
chemical or physical forces operating at the nanoscale to assemble basic units into 
larger structures. NC can also be derived from a bottom-up process using the 
synthesis of bacteria (Figure 12.1). 
Cellulose is a multilayer, complex molecular structure made up of ultrafine 
fibrils with nanoscale dimensions. In nanodomains, these nanofibrils have highly 
ordered nano crystallites and low-ordered whiskers. Although nanocellulose is 
made from cellulose, it has radically different properties than cellulose. It has 
improved crystallinity, a large surface area, rheological qualities, alignment and 
orientation, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and low toxicity, among other 
characteristics. Due of its extraordinary physical qualities, outstanding surface 
328 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications chemistry, and superior biological properties, nanocellulose has attracted a lot of 
attention for numerous biochemical applications. 
The characteristics of nanocellulose are influenced by the source, isolation 
method, and possible surface changes. Surface modification methods on nano￾cellulose are commonly employed to incorporate charged or hydrophobic mole￾cules. The different types are silylation, sulfonation, esterification, polymerization, 
urethanization, etherification, and phosphorylation (Thomas et al. 2018) (Daud and 
Lee 2017). Nanocellulose possesses good strength, a high Young’s modulus, bio￾compatibility, adjustable self-assembly, thixotropic, and photonic characteristics, 
all of which are important for its uses. 
Nanocellulose is used to make a wide range of nanomaterials and nano￾composites, including polymers, metals, metal oxides, and carbon-based com￾pounds. Nanocellulose, in particular, works well with organic-based materials, 
imparting mechanical qualities to the composite (Srivastava et al. 2021). When 
material strength, flexibility, and/or specialised nano structuration are required, 
nanocellulose can be used as a potential material. Functional paper, optoelec￾tronics, and antibacterial coatings are among the applications, which also include: 
packaging, mechanically reinforced polymer composites, tissue scaffolds, drug 
delivery, biosensors, energy storage, catalysis, environmental remediation, and 
electrochemically controlled separation. Phosphorylated nanocellulose is a fas￾cinating material with a diverse range of uses in multiple dimensions, such as 
bone scaffolds, adsorbents, and so on.

Nanocellulose Membranes for Biogas Upgradation 329 12.3 MEMBRANE TECHNOLOGY – TERMS IN GAS SEPARATION 
The performance of membranes is defined in terms of “purity” and “recovery” of 
the permeate gas. Purity is defined as the ratio of quantity of permeating gas present 
at the permeate side of the membrane to the other gas in the binary mixture. 
Recovery is defined as the quantity of permeating gas left after what is passed 
through the retentate side. To enhance the purity and recovery of the membrane￾separation process and make it more competent, it is desired to have both high 
selectivity and permeability at a lower operating cost. 
Permeability of a gas (component A) is obtained by the product of the kinetic 
factor: the diffusion coefficient (DA) and the thermodynamic factor – the solubility 
coefficient (SA). 
PA = DASA
(Rafiq, Deng, and Hägg 2016) 
Another unit of defining the performance of a membrane is permeance. It is 
generally given in gas permeation unit (GPU), 1 GPU = 1 × 10–6 cm3
(STP) cm–2 s
–1 
cm Hg–1. The permeability (PA) can be calculated by multiplying the thickness of 
membrane (l) with the permeance in GPU. The unit of permeability is barrer, where 
1 barrer = 1 × 10–16 GPU. The ideal selectivity in terms of permeability over 
component B αA/B is

See Table 12.1 for some of the recent works done in CO2 separation, the impact 
of NC on the performance of membranes and the comparison of different combi￾nations of NC with other materials. 
12.3.1 ROBESON’S UPPER BOUND 
Even though polymeric membranes have been successfully commercialised since 
the 1980s, their performance is limited by an unfavourable trade-off between per￾meability (P) and selectivity (α), and hence is constrained by an upper limit, as 
demonstrated empirically by Robeson (Robeson 2008). Researchers have set the 
benchmark as this upper bound for membrane separation of gases. Membranes 
going beyond the upper bound are treated as highly efficient. 
12.4 FACILITATED TRANSPORT MECHANISM (FTM): CONCEPT, 
TYPES, AND APPLICABILITY OF NC IN UTILIZING THE 
MECHANISM FOR BIOGAS UPGRADATION 
FTMs combine the advantages of selectivity of reactive processes, along with 
the reduced energy, mass, and volume of membranes. In biogas purification, the 
330 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications membrane’s reactive component (carrier), interacts with CO2 reversibly to form 
a CO2 carrier complex (Tong and Ho 2017). This process happens with the 
concentration gradient across the membrane. The CO2 permeation is assisted by 
the low partial pressure of CO2 at the permeate side. The CO2 complex formed 
is reversed at the permeate side. The carrier is then regenerated by the release of 
the collected CO2. Thus, a CO2 selective permeation takes place (Noble 1992) 
(Ward and Robb 1967). This is in contrast to the usual gas-permeation me￾chanism observed in membranes, which is solution–diffusion. In solution– 
diffusion, the gases generally permeate in a membrane from the feed side to the 
permeate side, which is a very slow process. The main highlight of facilitated 
transport is that the drawback of solution–diffusion can be countered (see 
Figure 12.2(d)). 
12.4.1 CARRIERS: WORKING PRINCIPLE 
CO2 transport is aided by the carriers in the membrane. They form bonds with CO2 
molecules and selectively allow them to pass through the membrane. Moisture in 
the membrane aids the carriers in this facilitation and is a crucial component of the 
action (Janakiram et al. 2020). Other nonreactive gases (including CH4) in the feed 
will also pass through the membrane during this time, albeit at a very slow rate via 
solution–diffusion (see Figure 12.2(d)) (Kasahara, Kamio, and Matsuyama 2014) 
(Kasahara et al. 2012). 
Amines are generally utilized as carriers for CO2-selective FTMs synthesis 
due to the good amine–CO2 affiliation. Organic bases like quaternary ammonium 
hydroxide and carbonate, CO2 hydration catalyst, amidine, carboxylate, and 
mimic enzymes like Zn-cyclen and vinylimidazole-zinc complex are also used 
as carriers (M. Saeed and Deng 2015) (Yao et al. 2012). Amidine, guanidine 
groups, etc., were also found to have very high permeability and selectivity

Nanocellulose Membranes for Biogas Upgradation 331 (Blinova and Svec 2012). These carriers are less popular as their reaction pro￾ducts are normally slower than the ‘amine–CO2’ reaction. It is worth to mention 
here that the diffusion of any ‘functional group-CO2’ reaction product is the 
deciding factor of the CO2 transport through the membrane (Belaissaoui et al. 
2020). These carriers are preferred where superior oxidative stability and me￾chanical strength of the membrane at higher temperature is essential because 
amines are prone to oxidative degradation (Han and Ho 2021). Another type is 
iptycene containing thermally rearranged (TR) polymers, which are utilised more 
now for CO2 separation due to their excellent CO2/CH4 selectivity and shorter 
physical ageing (Weidman and Guo 2017). The molecular design of perfluoro 
dioxolanes is also suitable for CO2/CH4 separation due to chemical and plasti￾cization resistance. Other fluorine-containing glassy polymers, such as fluori￾nated polyimides, TR, and triptycene-based polymers can also be used as 
carriers. 
12.4.1.1 Mobile Carrier Membranes 
The mobile carriers can move freely across the membrane. They can be classified as 
two types: supported liquid membrane and ion-exchange membranes. 
12.4.1.2 Supported Liquid Membrane (SLM) 
This type of membrane works on the principle of the movement of mobile car￾riers, which are kept dissolved in a liquid membrane. A liquid film is kept sta￾tionary in a microporous support membrane (Figure 12.2(a)). The target solute 
will be transported by the carriers due to the formation of a carrier-moisture 
complex. This complex diffuses through the membrane (Hess, Staudt-Bickel, and 
FIGURE 12.2 (a) Mechanism of supported liquid membranes, (b) Ion exchange mem￾branes, (c) Fixed site carrier membranes, (d) Facilitated transport involving mobile carriers 
and fixed site carriers compared with solution–diffusion. 
332 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications Lichtenthaler 2006) (Li et al. 2017). Such a membrane is also known as an im￾mobilized liquid membrane (ILM) (Ward and Robb 1967) (Swaidan et al. 2015) 
(Washim Uddin and Hägg 2012). As time passes by, the possibility of membrane 
drying happens. This is a limitation of this membrane as it only works in the 
presence of humidity, and thus, membrane drying can rapidly deteriorate the 
membrane’s separation properties. Deactivation of carriers is another dis￾advantage. This happens due to the incapability of carriers to carry the complex 
due to the higher concentration of complex formation at a time. SLM also lacks 
membrane stability because of the carrier solution volatility (Sarma Kovvali and 
Sirkar, 2001). 
12.4.1.3 Ion-Exchange Membranes (IEM) 
The carrier-solution volatility problem encountered in the liquid membranes can be 
resolved using IEMs (Figure 12.2(b)) (Luis and Bruggen, 2013). They are devel￾oped as support materials for aqueous carrier agents to prepare FTMs. In IEMs, the 
attractive electrostatic forces help to retain the ionic mobile carriers inside the 
membranes. Even though this will significantly reduce the leakage of carriers, a 
complete blockage of carrier loss is not possible. Also, the efficiency in gas per￾meation is lowered because of the induction of oriental crystallization by the 
charged polymeric matrix (Liao et al. 2014). 
12.4.1.4 Fixed-Site Carrier Membranes (FSC) 
Carriers form a covalent bond with the membrane matrix in FSC, thus solving the 
problem of carrier leakage. FSC holds the advantage of the durability of a dense 
membrane due to the strong bonds and the selectivity of a mobile carrier membrane 
due to the presence of carriers. Fixed carriers as functional groups are present in 
the polymer backbone or in the form of pendant groups. The mostly used poly￾amides, like PVAm, PAA, PEI, polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer, chitosan, 
etc., are some examples. 
The disadvantage of the FSC is that the permeance and selectivity are much 
lower than the mobile carrier membranes (see Figure 12.2(c)). 
12.4.2 APPLICABILITY OF NC IN BIOGAS UPGRADATION 
NC normally has the properties of a gas-barrier material. To make it usable for gas 
permeating in membranes, water vapour presence is required. This will enhance the 
CO2 permeating nature of NC, which will in turn help in the facilitated transport 
and thus the separation of CO2 from biogas. But NC needs the support of other 
hydrophilic materials (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl amine (PVAm)), 
etc. to carry out very high CO2 permeation. See Table 12.1 for some of the recent 
works done in CO2 separation, the impact of NC on the performance of membranes 
and the comparison of different combinations of NC with other materials. 
From the table, the CO2 separation work by Jahan et al. on CNC-PVA membrane 
shows that, by incorporating CNC, the permeance increased nearly by five times 
and the selectivity more than doubled. On another work using CNF, permeance 
doubled and the selectivity increased from 29 to 39. This shows that, CNF has a 
Nanocellulose Membranes for Biogas Upgradation 333 marked impact on improving the performance of the membrane. But NC alone is 
not suitable for performing biogas purification. From the table, works conducted by 
Ansaloni et al. and Venturi et al. displayed that, without the presence of a hydro￾philic agent like PVAm, the permeability of membranes involving pure NC is 
negligible. However, the selectivity was found to be very high. Even though with 
high selectivity, negligible permeability/permeance will make the material un￾suitable for biogas purification. Hence, a combination of both can achieve high 
performance to the biogas purification membranes. 
12.5 FACTORS AFFECTING PERMEABILITY AND SELECTIVITY 
12.5.1 EXTERNAL FACTORS 
12.5.1.1 Effect of Relative Humidity 
Relative humidity helps in increasing the permeance of membranes in gas se￾paration. For achieving this, pure NC alone is not alone sufficient. Hydrophilic 
materials like PVA, PVAm, etc. are needed to use this advantage. A comparison 
of some of the recent studies on CO2 separation by FT membranes on pure NC 
membranes and NC-based composite membranes is shown in Figure 12.3. It 
shows that, as the RH increases, the permeability increases. This can be attributed 
to the presence of hydrophilic materials in the membrane composition, which 
created membrane swelling to let the gas pass through, thereby increasing the 
permeability. However, without the hydrophilic materials, pure NC membranes 
do not have the capability to let the gas permeate at high permeability. However, 
selectivity increased, which can be attributed to the controlled swelling of NC 
even at high RH (Jahan et al. 2018b). Selectivity increased from 2 to 300 for pure 
CNF for a change in RH from 0 to 85% (Venturi, Ansaloni, and Baschetti 2016) 
(Ansaloni et al. 2017), while permeance ranged in the minuscule from 0.000006 
m3
/m2 bar h to 0.0006 m3
/m2 bar h. Up to 50% RH, for pure CNF, both the 
permeance and selectivity lagged and beyond 50% RH the selectivity increased 
exponentially up to 300 without utilisable improvement in permeance. In contrast, 
for NC-based composites, the permeability increased very highly. A study con￾ducted on CNF-PVAm (Venturi, Ansaloni, and Baschetti 2016) showed that the 
permeability increased exponentially (U. Saeed et al. 2020) with increasing RH. 
A striking feature is that, after 55% RH the selectivity went down (see 
Figure 12.3(d)). This is because of the high water activity at high RH. At high 
water activity, the difference in permeance of the different gases will be reduced 
due to the high swelling of the membrane (all the gases will pass easily at similar 
rates) and hence the reduction in selectivity. For the CNF-PVAm composite 
(Ansaloni et al. 2017), the permeability went beyond 0.08 m3
/m2 bar h at 85% 
RH, where the selectivity was attained at around 30. Another reason for the 
decrease in selectivity is the high RH water clustering. Venturi et al. found out 
that at levels of medium to higher humidity, a triggering of water clustering in the 
membrane matrix happened, which in turn resulted in the downfall of selectivity 
(Venturi et al. 2018). This is due to the massive swelling of the membranes. The 
CNF content, which was added at different proportions from 30% to 70%, 
334 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications showed that the dimension of water clustering was decreasing from 5.1 to 4.1 
with the increase in CNF. However, with the reduced content of PVAm, per￾meability was severely affected. Water sorption tests on the membrane were 
conducted to quantify the water presence and it showed that the membrane with 
lower proportions of CNF content (70% PVAm and 30% CNF) helped in redu￾cing the swelling and increasing the water uptake. Considering all these aspects, 
an optimum membrane material composition of 70% PVAm content and 30% 
CNF was proposed as the optimum range in the study, where the permeance was 
achieved at the maximum value of 0.01009 m3
/m2 bar h at 85% RH and a se￾lectivity of 184. 
Apart from this, the effect of high partial vapor pressures in reducing the 
moisture content even at high RH contributes to the loss of permeance and se￾lectivity (He and Hagg 2017). 
12.5.1.2 Effect of Feed Pressure 
The permeance and selectivity of the membrane are reduced as the gas supply 
pressure is increased. This might be due to the stacking of polymer chains, which 
causes the membrane to become denser at high pressure, restricting gas permeance 
(Zhu et al. 2019) (Kida, Maeta, and Yogo 2018). Permeance and selectivity are also 
influenced by polymer chain motion. The gas-separation performance of 
FIGURE 12.3 (a) Effect of RH on CO2 permeability of pure NC membrane (b) Selectivity 
of pure NC membrane (c) Permeability of NC based composites (d) Selectivity of NC based 
composites. 
Nanocellulose Membranes for Biogas Upgradation 335 membranes can be harmed by high polymer chain mobility. The polymer chain 
motion increases as the feed gas pressure rises. This action becomes more forceful 
at very high pressures, resulting in membrane "plasticization." The swelling of 
dissolved CO2 in the interstitial space between the polymer chains causes plasti￾cization, which is a permanent alteration in the polymer structure. The selectivity of 
CO2 decreases as permeance rises due to the plasticization effect. This is because 
the membrane allows all gas to travel through the permeate side (Xu et al. 2019). 
Another drawback of membranes operating with high feed pressures is the phe￾nomenon called as “carrier saturation.” This is the inefficiency of carriers to fa￾cilitate CO2 transfer across the membranes. Along with that, high feed pressure 
causes swelling (Jahan et al. 2018a). Due to this swelling, the water vapour per￾meance become higher than CO2 permeance (He and Hagg 2017) and hence causes 
water loss. The water vapour content in the gas stream, which is very important for 
the working of FTMs, is thus reduced and hence the permeance and selectivity are 
reduced. Thus, high water vapour content is required for high-pressure applications 
to avoid membrane drying. 
Some of the recent studies conducted to check the impact of high feed pressures 
displayed similar results. Jahan et al. experimented with pressures varying from 
5 to 15 bar, for which a decrease in permeance from 0.27 m3
/m2 bar h to 
0.18 m3
/m2 bar h and selectivity from 39 to 36 was observed for PVA/CNC 
membranes (Jahan et al. 2018b). On another study 1 wt% phosphorylated CNF 
(P-CNF) at 9 pH, the permeance reduced from 0.14 m3
/m2 bar h to 0.09 m3
/m2 bar h 
and selectivity reduced from 39 to 28(Jahan et al. 2020) (Figure 12.4). 
On another study conducted by Jia et al. (Jia et al. 2020) for finding the effect of 
varying feed pressure on ZIF-8@CNF 70 membranes, the permeability and se￾lectivity values were found to be steady for pressures in the range of 1–5 bar, which 
proved that the best operating pressures is on the sub 5 bar range when compared 
with that of the previously mentioned study. 
12.5.1.3 Effect of Temperature 
Increasing temperature causes weight loss of the membrane. This will increase the 
permeance of gases passing through the membrane, but the selectivity is reduced 
FIGURE 12.4 (a) Effect of feed pressure on CO2 permeance (b) Effect of feed pressure on 
CO2/CH4 selectivity. 
336 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications due to the loosening of the membrane. The decrease in selectivity can be controlled 
to a limit by incorporating more continuous CO2 pathways in the membranes (Jia 
et al. 2020). Thus, Robeson’s upper bound for CO2/CH4 shifts downward with the 
increase in temperature (Rowe et al. 2010). This is because in CO2/CH4 separation 
the high CO2 solubility and diffusivity are the driving factors for high separation 
(Han and Ho 2021). At high temperatures, the diffusivity will increase for CH4 
also and thus reduces selectivity. In FTMs, the temperature effect is more complex. 
Increasing temperature affects the facilitated transport in both ways (Saedi et al. 
2016). The negative effect in permeance is due to the decrease in the equilibrium 
constant of CO2 reversible reaction with carriers (Shen et al. 2006). However, the 
diffusivity is increased due to the increasing temperature, which is helpful for 
permeation. In the studies conducted, where the diffusivity is prevalent than 
the decrease in equilibrium constant, the permeance is increasing. A 54% increase 
of permeance and 40% decrease in selectivity was observed for a temperature 
change from 35°C–75°C (Ebadi Amooghin et al. 2016). NC based FTMs also 
showed similar findings like other FTMs. A 56% increase of permeance and 
45% decrease in selectivity was observed for a temperature range from 25°C–85°C 
(See Figure 12.5). 
12.5.1.4 Effect of pH 
Hydroxyl groups abound in alkaline substances like NaOH will increase the per￾meance and selectivity because of the presence of hydroxyl groups. The following 
are the entire reactions: 
CO2 combines with water to form bicarbonates in the first stage. 
CO2 + H2O H2CO3
These bicarbonate ions then react reversibly with NaOH. 
FIGURE 12.5 (a) Influence of temperature on Robeson’s upper bound, (b) Reducing se￾lectivity and increasing permeability with increase in temperature. 
Nanocellulose Membranes for Biogas Upgradation 337 H2CO3 + NaOH NaHCO3 + H2O
NaHCO3 NaOH + CO2
Thus, CO2 dissolution in water swollen membrane is enhanced and later it dis￾associates into bicarbonates. The optimum pH for getting good permeance and 
selectivity on NC-based FTM was observed in the studies on CNC/PVA mem￾branes by Jahan et al. (Jahan et al. 2018b). The pH was increased by adding sodium 
hydroxide (NaOH). The results of permeance and selectivity adhered to the general 
observation mentioned above (M. Saeed and Deng 2015) (Kim et al. 2013). The 
optimum pH value is taken as 9 for the CNC 1 wt%/PVA membrane. This is be￾cause after 9 pH, a sudden and steep rise in thickness occurred. Increase in thickness 
is a backlash in the otherwise favourable permeance environment set up by the high 
pH. This could be due to the flocculation of CNC at pH greater than 9, which 
created viscous solutions. Also, the flocculation created thickness, which are non￾uniform in their nature which gave nonuniform permeance. Similar results were 
obtained for studies on CNF/PVA membranes (Jahan et al. 2020). 
Some of the major internal variables of the membranes affecting the perfor￾mances of the membrane are thickness of the membrane, moisture uptake capacity, 
crystallinity, etc. (Yasin et al. 2014). 
12.5.2 EFFECT OF INTERNAL PARAMETERS 
12.5.2.1 Effect of Thickness 
It is a complicated phenomenon between membrane thickness and CO2 permeance. 
In general, a thick membrane results in poor CO2 permeance and is not re￾commended. This is because as the thickness of the membrane rises, the CO2 
molecules that are carried across it will face increased resistance. However, per￾meance is not the only factor to consider when choosing a membrane thickness. 
For example, increasing the thickness of membranes used for gas separation in 
extremely high-pressure applications up to a certain point is helpful since it pro￾vides physical support to sustain the pressure. As a result, the membrane plastici￾zation effect associated with high input pressures may be avoided. 
More than the physical strength lending property offered by the increased 
thickness, quantification of thickness effect on the membrane performance with 
permeance/permeability and selectivity is significant. The measurements on CO2 
permeability through a thick film cannot be extrapolated to calculate the CO2 
permeance of a thin-film FTM. Since, thin film membranes are more significant in 
CO2 separation, permeance is more meaningful than permeability to quantify the 
performance of a membrane. Figure 12.6 shows the effect of thickness on per￾meance and permeability. Data from different previous studies are taken and the 
impact of thickness on permeance and permeability is depicted. The studies shows 
that the general trend is that, with increasing thickness, permeance is reduced and 
permeability is increased. 
338 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications In NC-based FTMs, an addition of CNC in the membrane showed increased 
thickness. Jahan et al. (Jahan et al. 2018b) found that CNC addition to PVA 
makes the membrane thick, which gave the output at the permeate side differently 
at varying CNC concentrations. Permeance and selectivity experiments conducted 
at different weight concentrations of CNC observed that 1 wt % of CNC optimum 
for the membranes. The thickness observed at this composition is 905 nm and at 
2 wt%, thickness shot up to 1450 nm. CNC addition up to 1 wt% helped in 
increasing the permeance because of the impact of hydroxyl groups in the CNC 
and beyond that, the CO2 permeance was significantly reduced. Similar results 
were obtained on another study conducted using phosphorylated CNF (P-CNF) 
(Jahan et al. 2020). Venturi et al. (Venturi et al. 2018) used 30% weight of CNC 
with lupamin, and got the permeance of 0.0057 m3
/m2 bar h and selectivity of 
135. The thickness of the membrane was 50 microns. The near 50-fold reduction 
in permeance showed when compared to the previously mentioned studies, it can 
be attributed to the 50-time increase in thickness of the membrane. An aberration 
to the thickness effect on permeance was observed in the study conducted by 
Matsumoto et al. (Matsumoto and Kitaoka 2016). An extremely high permeance 
of 8.22 m3
/m2 bar h is about 30 times higher than the results observed in the 
FIGURE 12.6 SEM images of (a) Cross-sectional view and thickness of pure PVA (b)

thickness of 1.5% CNC in PVAm (d) Comparison between permeance and permeability with 
change in selective layer thickness. 
Nanocellulose Membranes for Biogas Upgradation 339 previous studies. The selectivity of 123 was achieved with membrane thickness of 
50 microns for MOF-TOCN@paper. This can be attributed to the combination of 
gas-barrier TOCNs and nano porous MOFs which gave extremely high CO2 
permeance and selectivity. Thus, the choice of membrane materials significantly 
impacted on the effect of thickness on permeance. 
A recent study on the effect of casting suspension viscosity on membrane 
thickness was conducted on PVA/CNC membranes (Jahan et al. 2018a). The 
viscosity was adjusted (made equal on all sides) by water dilution. A difference of 
4 centipoise was observed at 1.5 wt% CNC on PVA after the adjustment. Hence, 
a thickness reduction from 1500 nm to 650 nm occurred. Permeance tests showed 
a marginal improvement of 1.2% permeance when compared to the previously 
conducted study of the same CNC composition in PVA. The selectivity also 
improved from 36 to 39. 
12.5.2.2 Effect of Mechanical Properties of Membrane 
The presence of nanocellulose imparts strength to the membrane. A study by Niazi 
et al. (Niazi et al. 2017) compared pure PVA to the added concentrations of CNF. 
The results showed a gradual increase of elastic modulus as the percentage of CNF 
added was increased. Venturi et al. (Venturi et al. 2018) studied the elastic modulus 
for pure CNF and compared with combinations of different percentages of PVAm. 
The results displayed similar output as in the former study. Pure CNF was found to 
have an elastic modulus seven times more than the membrane with 70% CNF 
composition with 30% PVAm. 
12.5.2.3 Crystallinity 
Degree of crystallinity is a measure of the structural quality of a polymer. It is 
directly related to the nature of the polymer while melting, whether it behaves 
like a typical solid or transitions between glassy and rubbery states. While used as 
membrane materials for gas separation, rubbery polymers generally have low 
solubility coefficients and high diffusion coefficients than glassy polymers. The 
diffusion selectivity advantage lies with glassy polymers, and they dominate the 
Robeson upper bound (Robeson et al. 2015). Glassy polymers are thus preferred 
in FTMs due to the high solubility and diffusion selectivity. In membranes used 
for gas separation, crystalline regions present in the membrane materials restrict 
gas permeation and thus amorphous regions are needed for gas permeance. 
Figure 12.7 shows the gas permeance through crystalline and amorphous regions 
in NC. 
The choice of NC as membrane material presents a trade-off between gas per￾meating and restricting characteristic. The gas permeating can be attributed to the 
high hydroxyl groups on the NC surface and the permeation-restricting character￾istic is due to the crystallinity NC is offering to the membrane. Some of the recently 
conducted studies on NC-based membranes for CO2 separation displayed the 
methods to reduce the crystallinity impact on gas permeance. Matsumoto et al. 
found that the high number of hydrogen bonds between the crystalline TOCNs 
(tempo oxidized nanofibres) contributed to the highly dense structure of the 
membrane and gas permeance was restricted due to this (Matsumoto and Kitaoka 
340 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 2016). To reverse the outcome, they incorporated MOF (metal organic frameworks) 
to TOCN to facilitate CO2 transport. 
On another study, to find the optimum CNC combination with PVA where the 
crystallinity impact on the gas permeation property of the membrane, Jahan et al. 
(Jahan et al. 2018b) tried out different proportions of CNC from 0.5 wt% in PVA to 
for 2 wt%. The crystallinity values increased in proportion with the increase in CNC 
content from 58% to 66%. The CO2 permeation was enhanced up to 1 wt% CNC 
because of the overlapping of the impact of hydroxyl groups over the permeation 
restricting effect. The effect of the moisture-absorbing capability of CNC also in￾creased the chain flexibility. However, beyond that, the structure of the polymer was 
found to be becoming less flexible, and the chain mobility was reduced with the 
increasing CNC concentration (Mandal and Chakrabarty 2014). This is because of 
the increase in nucleating agents, which in turn created large quantities of small 
crystallites getting bundled together. The membrane also got thicker due to the 
crystalline nature of CNC. Both the rigidity and thickness also contributed to 
the decrease in the CO2 permeation. Similar performance was found by Saeed et al. 
(U. Saeed et al. 2020) in their work, which also presented 1 wt% of CNF in PVA as 
the optimum NC concentration. 
12.6 SUMMARY 
This chapter focused on the effect of nanocellulose in biogas upgradation. The 
impartation of facilitated transport mechanism by the addition of carriers for the 
significant improvement of the outcomes in polymeric membranes are also dis￾cussed. The type of carriers and classification of FTM is given.

Nanocellulose Membranes for Biogas Upgradation 341 The importance of nanocellulose as a material to be used for CO2 separation in 
the composite is highlighted here. The impact of the hydroxyl groups on the 
reactive surface of nanocellulose is highlighted. The classification of nanocellu￾lose and the comparison between these is also mentioned. The research done to 
improve the outcomes using different functionalisation methods like carbox￾ymethylation, phosphorylation, etc., are discussed here. External variables af￾fecting permeance and selectivity are detailed with the findings from the recent 
studies based on NC-based FTMs. It is shown from the studies that RH being a 
major parameter helped in increase of CO2 permeance in all the studies. A pre￾ferred RH of 90% is most mentioned considering the impact it has in selectivity 
also. Another parameter discussed is temperature effect. Permeance increased for 
CO2 because of the loosening of the membrane at high temperatures, but it is 
shown that the selectivity decreased. Atmospheric temperature is suggested in 
some studies, as the optimum to opt for. Even though explored less, the impact of 
increasing pH by adding sodium hydroxide is also mentioned, which was con￾ducted in one study. Feed pressure is another factor defined where its increase 
drastically reduced the outcomes. This trend is visible more in the high-pressure 
regions from 5 bar onward. 
The internal parameters of the membrane material are also presented. It is shown 
that, thicker the membrane, lesser is the permeance of the membrane but selectivity of 
CO2 increased. Other parameters like NC concentration, moisture-uptake capacity, 
and membrane strength are also briefed. Crystallinity restricted the CO2 permeation 
through it, because of the high density they offer to the membrane.

13.1 INTRODUCTION 
Given the more adverse effects of global warming and environmental disasters, 
scientists have focused their attention more on the remediation of it for the past few 
decades. The use of petroleum-based polymers is at its peak stage for tremendous 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003245261-15 347 applications in diverse fields, irrespective of the adverse impacts they are producing 
on the environment due to their nonbiodegradable nature. Research in the field of 
biomaterials explores a wide variety of polysaccharides and other naturally oc￾curring materials, as an alternative to nonbiodegradable materials, that are capable 
of replacing plastic and other synthetic counterparts (Y. Chen et al. 2021). Recent 
research on fire-retardant (FR) application has ended up with the usage of aerogels 
for their ability to effectively retard any propagation of fire and heat conduction due 
to their specialized ultralight porous structure, unlike any conventional materials. 
Aerogels are highly porous solid materials having a density close to air (Zhao 
et al. 2015). It mainly constitutes a polymer structure having a porosity of 99% and 
air in it; hence, the name aerogel. Aerogels as a class of advanced materials were 
first produced by Kistler in 1931 using silica, gelatin, albumin, cellulose and agar 
(F. Zhu 2019). Silica aerogel is the first commercially developed and widely used 
aerogel (Patel, Purohit, and Suthar 2009; Hasan et al. 2017; Lamy-Mendes, Silva, 
and Durães 2018). Even though the silica aerogel found its applications in thermal 
insulation and oil-water separation, the fragile nature of silica aerogel limits its 
application as a thermal-resistance coating due to its lack of flexibility. So silica is 
mostly manufactured in small granules or powder form, but this is not suitable for 
convenient and effective application as a surface coating. Hence, it is necessary to 
either improve the properties of the aerogel by using functional additives or to 
develop new green materials or composite aerogels, which have all the desired 
characteristics (Y. X. Chen et al. 2021). 
Recent research explores green materials such as nanocellulose, chitin, chitosan, 
starch, lignin, etc., which are cheap and abundantly available but highly suitable for 
making aerogel for specific applications, especially for flame retardancy and 
thermal insulation. The large specific surface area due to high porosity, tunable 
surface chemistry, mechanical stability, nontoxic nature, and biodegradability of 
such green aerogels make it an excellent choice as an insulating material, thermal 
insulator, and flame-retardant material. Its functionalization and composite forms 
considering thermal properties for applications in the field of flame retardancy are 
explained in detail in this chapter. 
The properties possessed by aerogels and their applications in different scenarios 
are explained in detail in Table 13.1. It is obvious that the properties and appli￾cations of aerogels are not limited; there are vast opportunities for them to be used 
in engineering, medical, and energy fields. 
13.1.1 CLASSIFICATION OF AEROGELS 
Aerogels classification is done based on the type of materials used and their pore 
diameters. Both inorganic and organic materials can be used for making aerogels; 
however, organic polymers such as proteins and polysaccharides are given much 
more focus as they are eco-friendly and sustainable. Considering the pore size 
aerogels are classified into three micro porous (pore diameter <2 nm) aerogel, 
mesoporous (pore diameter 2~50 nm), aerogel (Muhammad et al. 2021), and 
macroporous (>50 nm) aerogel (Muhammad et al. 2021). 
348 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications The major classifications and the materials used are shown in Figure 13.1. 
Aerogel can be made using a single material or in composite form. The major base 
materials used for aerogels are oxides of silica and non-silica, resin and cellulose￾based organic materials, carbon-based materials like CNT and graphene, chalco￾genide aerogel and other kinds of aerogel (single element, carbide, etc.). Also, the

FIGURE 13.1 Classification of aerogels( Muhammad et al. 2021). 
Flame-Retardant Green Aerogels 349 composite aerogels can be of multi-composition, gradient aerogel and micro-/nano￾aerogel compositions (Du et al. 2013). 
Aerogel is normally made in three different forms (Figure 13.2), monoliths (large 
solid blocks), powders and film forms, according to the applications for which it is 
used and the properties of the materials, like its flexibility, fragile nature, me￾chanical stability etc. (Du et al. 2013). 
Although there are a lot of aerogel materials available, more focus is on green 
aerogels based on cellulose, chitosan, starch, and lignin due to their abundance, 
sustainability, and modifiable chemistry. The highly porous, hence minimal density 
and low thermal conductive nature of these green aerogels find applications in 
diverse engineering fields due to their changeable chemistry as a thermal insulators, 
energy storage material, catalyst supports, adsorbents, and electromagnetic 
shielding. Even though the NC aerogels are highly flammable, recent studies ela￾borate that increased chances of functionalization can mitigate such drawbacks 
drastically (Sun et al. 2021). The aerogel was invented in 1929–1930 by Dr Samuel 
Stephens Kistler, and it is commercially produced in the early 1950s. Lack of proper 
manufacturing methods, huge time consumption, and unavailability of better ma￾terials led to the stage of abandoning the further research in this field. With the 
introduction of the material science discipline, new materials and processing 
methods were successfully turned out, and that changed the history of aerogels. The 
detailed history and current scenario are shown in Figure 13.3. Nowadays, aerogels 
with different characteristics are used in many engineering fields, as well as in 
medical fields such as thermal insulators, flame-retardant coatings, energy storage 
devices, etc. 
13.1.2 CHARACTERISTICS OF AEROGELS 
Characteristics of the aerogels are dependent on the material used and the pre￾paration method. Some of the relevant properties are given in Figure 13.4. The 
characteristics can be controlled by changing the precursors and their concentration. 
Therefore, the parameters like specific surface area, mass density, pore size, and 
pore volume can be varied substantially (Zheng et al. 2020). The processing method 
also plays a major role in the physiochemical properties of the aerogels as the 
method employed for the removal of liquid from gel may affect the structure of the 
aerogel in multiple ways. Structure breakage and shrinkage are two major defects 
FIGURE 13.2 Different forms of aerogels (a) monolith ( Khamidi et al. 2014), (b) powder 
( Wei, Zhu, and Sun 2022) (c) sheet ( Shanmugam et al. 2020).

glycol, PPy – polypyrrole, PVA – polyvinyl alcohol, PBAs – polyhydroxybutyrates, PANi - 
polyaniline) ( Ahankari et al. 2021). 
Flame-Retardant Green Aerogels 351 observed in the freeze-drying process. The essential behaviour required in thermal 
insulation is the lower thermal conductivity and in flame retardancy is higher 
porosity along with good mechanical stability and char formation. The major 
characteristics of focus as a surface coating are porosity, mechanical strength, 
thermal conductivity, and flame retardancy. 
13.1.2.1 Porosity 
Porosity is the most desirable property in aerogels. It inherently controls the me￾chanical strength, surface area, density, heat resistance, and flame retardance. Silica 
aerogel, the first commercially developed and the most widely used aerogel ma￾terial, has a very low density of 0.003 g/cm3
–0.5 g/cm3 and a high specific surface 
area of 600 m2
/g–1500 m2
/g. These properties offer it a very low thermal con￾ductivity, as low as 0.012 W/ m·K (Zheng et al. 2020). The pore size is also a 
significant factor when come to the Knudsen effect, which affects the heat re￾sistance and hence the flame retardancy and emission of toxic gases. 
13.1.2.2 Mechanical Strength 
Mechanical strength is greatly influenced by the porosity and density of the 
aerogel. The high porosity and very low density of the aerogel make it a brittle and 
hence easily collapsible structure. The fragile nature of traditional aerogel mate￾rials (especially silica aerogels) was found to be inappropriate for insulation and 
flame-retardant application due to their poor mechanical characteristics. It is es￾sential to enhance their properties by the modification of the microstructure of the 
aerogel matrix to impart good mechanical strength to use in potential applications. 
FIGURE 13.4 Properties of aerogels ( Thapliyal and Singh 2014). 
352 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications Functionalization can bring about flexibility and good mechanical strength for 
aerogels. By the addition of filler to the polysaccharide aerogel matrix the modulus 
of compression can be increased (Muhammad et al. 2021). Another concern is the 
moisture absorbance of the aerogels, due to their hydrophilic nature. Crosslinking 
has to be done to improve the hydrophobic nature of the aerogel (Muhammad et al. 
2021). Materials like carbon, organic, and metal oxides are also gaining interest as 
aerogel materials (X. Zhang et al. 2011; Araby et al. 2016; Qian et al. 2017), but 
their low tensile strength and fragile nature limit their use in applications that 
require flexibility (Du et al. 2013; Venkataraman et al. 2016). Aerogel structure can 
be reinforced with organic or inorganic nanofillers and polymers (Wan et al. 2020). 
Polyamide aerogel exhibits good mechanical strength having an elastic modulus of 
more than 30 MPa, which is superior considering SiO2 aerogels (Fan et al. 2019). 
13.1.2.3 Thermal Conductivity 
Thermal conductivity is greatly influenced by the type of the polysaccharide used 
for making aerogels, the processing methods, the pore arrangements, and pore size. 
Heat transfer takes place through the air particles’ collision and thermal conduction. 
The lower pore size of aerogels reduces the number of collisions between the 
molecules, thus decreasing the thermal conductivity and limiting convective mass 
transfer. In particular, a lower-sized pore establishes hindrance to air molecules in 
heat convection by limiting its travel by maintaining the pore size much less than 
the mean free path (Muhammad et al. 2021). The thermal conductivity of silica 
aerogels is ~20 mW m−1 K−1, which is very low and can be used as a thermal 
insulator, but the brittle nature makes it mechanically weak and the high production 
cost restricts its application (Pekala, Alviso, and LeMay 1990; Meador et al. 2015; 
Feng et al. 2016). On the other hand, loss of porosity and increase in density can 
contribute to increased thermal conductivity as in the case of polyamide aerogels, 
for which it is 30–60 mW m−1 K−1. 
13.1.2.4 Flame Retardancy 
Polymer materials can be imparted with fire-retardant properties by incorporating 
them with fire retardant materials like halogen, phosphorous, metal nanoparticles, 
etc., during gelation. The flammability of aerogels depends on the thermal con￾ductivity. The greater the thermal conductivity, the greater will be the heat flow 
rate, which can lead to the release of volatile and toxic gases; that, in turn, facilitates 
the propagation of flame through the aerogel at a much faster rate. 
The most widely used fire retardants are intumescent flame retardants (IFRs). 
Upon heating, the IFR is converted into char form and prevents further heat transfer 
to the underlying layer; therefore, it hinders fire from heating and propagating to 
the underlying materials, as shown in Figure 13.5. An IFR consists of three com￾ponents: an acid source, a gas source, and a carbon source (M. Luo et al. 2021). 
Other factors affecting the flammability of aerogels are the structure of aerogels, the 
orientation of fibres in NC aerogels, decomposition temperature, and volatile gas 
emission while decomposing. It is observed that randomly oriented fibres are 
more vulnerable to fires due to increases permeation of oxygen than properly or￾iented, unidirectionally or bidirectionally, fibres (Kovačević, Flinčec Grgac, and 
Flame-Retardant Green Aerogels 353 Bischof 2021). Upon decomposition of aerogels to higher temperatures, it will 
release volatile gases that will aid further combustion and propagation instead of 
extinguishing it. 
13.2 PROCESSING OF AEROGELS 
Aerogels are made by combining a polymer with a solvent to form a gel, and then 
removing the liquid from the gel and replacing it with air. It is created by the 
gelation process in which a polymer is mixed with the solvent to form a mixture 
known as a colloid that follows polymerisation among polymer molecules and 
nanostructure formation. Cross-linking and branching between polymer molecules 
form a 3D porous structure (Dervin and Pillai 2017). The nanostructures form a 
network that spans the entire liquid volume leading to gel formation. Then the 
solvent liquid is removed by suitable means without affecting the structure formed 
resulting in aerogel (Muhammad et al. 2021). 
Various ways to remove the liquid from the pores of the gel may damage the 
structure if it is not done properly. The removal of solvent can be done by eva￾poration of the solvent and extraction of solvent through sublimation. The stresses 
associated with solvent removal can greatly affect the structure resulting in the 
breakage of the network and shrinkage. The methods which are used for solvent 
removal are: 
• Thermal drying 
• Freeze drying 
• Supercritical drying 
• Ambient pressure drying 
Capillary pressure depends on the surface tension of the solvent used. A high 
surface tension liquid increases the capillary pressure inside the pores. This will 
result in the collapse of the gel upon solvent removal. 
FIGURE 13.5 Mechanism of intumescent system ( Kovačević, Flinčec Grgac, and Bischof 
2021). 
354 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 13.2.1 THERMAL DRYING 
The easiest way of solvent removal is thermal drying, in which the solvent is 
removed by direct heating and evaporation of the gel. The evaporated liquid 
will flow through the porous structure and raise the capillary pressure, which 
results in the breakage of the gel structure. The main reason for stress is the 
capillary action of the liquid during the drying process, which tends to compress 
the pore structure and thereby breakage of the network at weak spots due 
to pressure gradient (Woignier et al. 2018). Also, shrinkage during thermal 
drying reduces the porosity of the aerogel produced. The aerogel produced in 
this way is termed xerogel. The drawbacks of shrinkage and breaking can be 
avoided by making the evaporation much slower at room temperature (Woignier 
et al. 2018). 
13.2.2 FREEZE DRYING 
The freeze-drying process involves freezing the solvent initially by exposing 
the gel to a very low temperature, around −80°C, and the resulting solid is 
sublimed to form a cryogel. Cryogels exhibit smaller surface areas and meso￾porous structures. 
13.2.3 SUPERCRITICAL DRYING (SCD) 
Supercritical drying (SCD) is the most widely used drying process because of its 
easiness, in which the air replaces pore liquid. To reduce the chances of structural 
damage, the liquid from the gel is removed in a controlled manner. In SCD, the wet 
gels are heated in closed containers to their critical temperature at critical pressure. 
13.2.4 AMBIENT PRESSURE DRYING 
Also known as subcritical drying in which the solvent in the gel is replaced with a 
liquid, through the solvent exchange, which shows critical pressure and temperature 
values close to ambient conditions. Then exposing it to the ambient condition will 
dry the gel to form aerogel. This method also has an added advantage of functio￾nalization of the structure through the admission of the low surface tension solvent. 
Subcritical drying is found to be more inexpensive and effective compared to the 
supercritical drying process. 
13.2.5 PROCESSING OF NC AEROGELS 
The lignin part and hemicellulose parts, which are present along with cellulose in 
lignocellulosic biomass, need to be removed using delignification and chemical 
treatment, and the resulting cellulose is mechanically crushed into NC fibrils 
(Muhammad et al. 2021). Then these NC can be used as a precursor to form a 
colloidal solution. 
Flame-Retardant Green Aerogels 355 There are three steps in NC aerogels preparation: 
1. Dissolving or dispersion of NC 
2. Forming NC gel by the sol-gel process, and 
3. Drying NC gel while preserving its 3D porous structure. 
Various NC aerogel preparation methods are available, like the freeze-drying 
method (Kordjamshidi et al. 2019), supercritical fluid technology (Kang et al. 
2019), compression moulding, and salt leaching (Singh, Zafar, and Talha 2019), 
fibre bonding (X. Chen et al. 2019), gas foaming (Manavitehrani et al. 2019), rapid 
prototyping (H. Wang et al. 2019), electrospinning (J. Zhang et al. 2019), freeze￾drying, and supercritical drying methods. Among all the preparation methods 
freeze-drying and supercritical drying methods are popular because they resulted in 
aerogels showing a microporous structure (Abe, Iwamoto, and Yano 2007; F. Jiang 
and Hsieh 2014). 
The surface area of the NC aerogels is dependent on the preparation method and 
it is observed that up to 600 m2
/g surface area could be achieved (Sehaqui et al. 
2011; Yamasaki et al. 2019). The fabrication process is depicted in Figure 13.6, 
using supercritical drying and freeze-drying methods. As discussed earlier, the 
supercritical drying method replaces liquid in the gel with a gas, normally air, as a 
result of the vaporization of solvent (J. Luo and Wang 2018). This ensures no 
damage to the aerogel structure due to the absence of capillary forces (Figure 13.6) 
FIGURE 13.6 Preparation of NC aerogels ( Nita et al. 2020) ( Li et al. 2021). 
356 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications (Moreno-Castilla and Maldonado-Hódar 2005; Cabañas et al. 2007; X. Wang et al. 
2016). Alternatively, in the supercritical drying process, the higher processing 
time is a challenge, and the high cost associated with it, due to the wastage of 
solvent (Yamasaki et al. 2019; Lee and Park 2020), hinders it production in com￾mercial scale. 
Since the freeze-drying process involves freezing the solvent below ambient 
temperature and is followed by sublimation, it will produce an open pore structure 
(J. Liu 2006; Hao et al. 2014; J. Song et al. 2019). The surface structure of the 
aerogels can be altered during any phase of the processing stage by controlling the 
process parameters and additives (Owens Corning 2018). The freezing process is 
done in two ways, slow cooling with unidirectional templating and submerging the 
gel directly into a cryogenic fluid. The former method produces crystallization in 
the freezing direction; hence, porous structure produced is parallel to the direction 
of crystallization, as shown in Figures 13.7a and b. On the other hand, the latter 
method leads to the formation of small nondirectional pores due to the fact that 
crystallization occurs all over the gel due to direct exposure of the whole gel 
structure to very low temperature. This results in high surface areas, as shown in 
Figures 13.7a and c. 
FIGURE 13.7 a) Unidirectional freezing and direct quenching of NC gels for freeze-drying 
( Zaman et al. 2020). b and c) SEM images of aerogels resulting from unidirectional freezing 
and direct quenching, respectively ( Munch et al. 2009; Munier et al. 2016). d and e) SEM 
images representing the porous structure formed via freeze-drying and supercritical drying 
(X. Wang et al. 2018). 
Flame-Retardant Green Aerogels 357 The supercritical drying method is superior compared to freeze-drying as it could 
preserve the pore structure intact, which is an essential super-insulating property. 
There are several new drying techniques to overcome the difficulties of making 
aerogels using traditional freeze-drying methods for mass-scale production. Spray 
freeze drying (SFD) is a newly introduced method by which pore-size of NC 
aerogels can be brought to the mesoporous range. SFD is a freeze-drying process, 
but the difference is in the way of freezing the gel, as shown in Figure 13.7d and e 
(Jiménez-Saelices et al. 2017). As the name indicates, the CNF suspensions (1–2.6 
wt% CNF) are sprayed in the mould at −80°C as compared to the preparation of 
colloid at room temperature and exposing it to −80°C. The thermal conductivity of 
the aerogels prepared by the SFD method (λ ~ 20 mW m−1 K−1) is less than that 
prepared by the CFD method (λ ~ 28 mW m−1 K−1), which is attributed to the 
macro-porous structure formation in SFD method. Jimenez-Saelices et al. formed 
aerogels with pore size in the mesoporous range employing TEMPO-oxidized CNF 
(Jiménez-Saelices et al. 2018). CNF was used as a stabilizer in such emulsions 
and formed strong gels as a template to form aerogels. Such bio-aerogels developed 
alveolar texture with closed pores in the alveolar cell walls. This resulted in super￾insulating aerogels with higher mechanical properties (toughness). Thus, it is 
evident that the SFD method can be used effectively for the mass production of 
aerogels in the mesoporous range. 
13.3 AEROGEL FUNCTIONALIZATION 
The characteristics of the aerogels can be altered substantially by the crosslinking of 
polysaccharides via physiochemical methods, which in turn modify characteristics 
like the specific surface area, pore size, and density (Muhammad et al. 2021). Since 
aerogel preparation is a multistage process, its functionalization can be done at 
suitable stages to impart its specific properties. The stages available for functio￾nalization are, 
• Functionalizing during gelation 
• Functionalizing after gelation 
• Functionalizing after supercritical drying 
The easiest way to modification of aerogels is in their primary stage of formation, 
i.e., during gelation. Here, the precursors are mixed with suitable monomers in 
the gelation process to form a gel network having specialised properties. The 
main advantage of this method is it is a simplified process, no additional pro￾cessing is required, and hence, the number of steps can be reduced. However, it is 
very difficult to find proper additives that can be reacted with precursors during 
the gelation process to impart the desired properties because it might change the 
pH of the solution; therefore, the gelation process time can be delayed. This, in 
turn, may produce unwanted chemical reaction that could produce adverse effects 
rather than benefits. 
Once the gel is formed, functionalization can be done by diffusion of reactive 
molecules into aerogel pores through the solvent. Once these molecules reach the 
358 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications surface of the aerogel structure, the bonding reaction takes place, and the properties 
are changed according to the chemicals introduced. This method ensures proper 
functionalization of the gel structure and greater flexibility and control over the 
process. Since diffusion is a process that involves the movement of molecules 
through the solvent, it will take time to reach the aerogel structure. This will make 
this process very slow; hence, it is not suited for monolithic, cubic, and spherical 
aerogels. If there is a chance of reaction between the solvent and the diffused 
molecule, the solvent must be replaced with another liquid which will enhance the 
diffusion. 
Vapour diffusion is yet another method, which can be done after the for￾mation of the aerogel at any time. Here, the drawback of molecular diffusion 
through solvent is not present. Hence, it is a comparatively faster process. The 
reactive molecules are introduced into the pore structure in the vapour form. 
These chemically reactive molecules can readily form bondings with the mo￾lecules available on the surface of the structure and functionalize it. The main 
advantage of this process is it does not produce any unwanted reactions, and the 
absence of solvent makes it much faster. However, reactive molecules in vapour 
form are very difficult to obtain without hazardous nature and the lack of ability 
of vapour molecules to reach every corner of the pores makes functionalization 
incomplete. 
A crosslinked aerogel polymer can be built by simple mixing, solution casting, 
free radical polymerization, ultraviolet (UV) and gamma-ray irradiation, bulk 
polymerization, or interpenetration (Muhammad et al. 2021). 
13.4 FLAME RETARDANT GREEN AEROGELS 
In the modern scenario with the increase in transportation and building, the cases of 
fire hazards are increasing day by day. This demands materials for providing 
thermal insulation and fire-retardant coating on expensive and easily flammable 
things. Bio-aerogels are given more interest these days due to their availability and 
biodegradability compared to other inorganic and organic chemicals. Many green 
materials are available to produce aerogels, including cellulose, starch, alginate, 
pectin, lignin, collagen, and chitosan. However, NC, chitin/chitosan, starch, and 
lignin are recently explored polysaccharides having growing interest. 
The growing importance of green aerogels in engineering applications is de￾picted in Figure 13.8, which shows the number of SCI-indexed journals published 
considering different green aerogels (ScienceDirect search engine, Jan. 2022). Also, 
the number of patents granted shows the growing interest in potential green aerogels 
(SciFinder Scholar database, January 2022). 
With the increase in global warming and considering energy saving as part 
of achieving sustainability, buildings are nowadays made with thermal insulation. 
By 2025, the thermal insulation market is expected to reach US$ 77 billion, 
which is around 5.4% of the compound annual growth rate CAGR (Owens 
Corning 2018). 
Still, the silica aerogels hold superior insulating properties compared to NC 
aerogels due to their bigger pore size. This increases the chances of thermal 
Flame-Retardant Green Aerogels 359 convection because the Knudsen effect cannot take place in pore sizes larger than 
the mean free path of air molecules. (Figure 13.9). Besides, conventional matrix 
materials like polyurethane and polyimide are mechanically stronger than green 
aerogels (Y. X. Chen et al. 2021). However, the availability of inorganic nanofillers, 
which are environmentally friendly and nontoxic, facilitates the usage of green 
aerogels by modifying their properties. 
13.5 GREEN AEROGELS WITH INORGANIC NANOFILLERS 
Green aerogels are environmentally friendly due to their biodegradable and sustain￾able nature. These days aerogels are developed from many green materials, especially 
polysaccharides like cellulose, chitosan, alginates, starch, pectin, carrageenan, gelatin, 
soy, and recently developed silk fibroin, which is getting more attention considering 
its abundance and specific properties (Montes and Maleki 2020). 
FIGURE 13.8 Growing importance of green aerogels reflects in increasing the number of 
SCI-indexed publications and patents granted over the last decade. 
FIGURE 13.9 Knudsen effect ( Apostolopoulou-Kalkavoura, Munier, and Bergström 2021). 
360 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications Polysaccharides are capable of crosslinking or entangling with other precursors 
due to the presence of several functional groups on the cell wall, such as hydroxyl, 
phosphate, sulfate, and carboxyl groups. Organic-inorganic hybrid materials are 
formed by the interaction between them, like hydrogen bonding, electrostatic 
interaction, Vander Waals force, or covalent bonds, at the molecular level 
(Muhammad et al. 2021). These nanofillers can impart flexibility, hydrophobicity, 
and any other specific functionalities onto the aerogel matrix by proper functio￾nalization. Inorganic nanofillers can be incorporated into NC aerogels to impart the 
hydrophobic nature, mechanical strength, and flame retardancy. The base material 
for the skeleton can be any polysaccharide of interest onto which additives are 
filled/functionalized through physical as well as chemical interaction in a controlled 
manner (Sukhavattanakul and Manuspiya 2020). 
The main issue with organic polymers is that they will release volatile flammable 
products, especially hydrocarbons as long as the heat supplied is sufficient enough 
to thermally degrade the material (Machado et al. 2021). Besides that, the toxic gas 
emission resulting from combustion also becomes fatal if the fire is not ex￾tinguished. Flame-retardant properties can be either intrinsically provided through 
new designs or an existing polymer can be filled with inorganic polymers that 
interfere with the flame through physical compounding or chemical crosslinking. 
The crosslinking of polysaccharides via physical and chemical methods can alter 
the physical properties of the aerogel, including the specific surface area, pore size, 
and density (Muhammad et al. 2021). Both organic and inorganic materials can be 
used as flame retardants, some of which are ammonium polyphosphate (APP), poly 
(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO), polydopamine(PDA), halloysite, sepiolite 
nanorods, SiO2, and so on. 
Every flame-retardant aerogel composite consists of three elements, a matrix 
made of suitable biopolymer, a reinforcement for improved mechanical strength and 
modification fillers for imparting flame-retardant properties (Kovačević, Flinčec 
Grgac, and Bischof 2021). The flame retardancy always happens due to the char 
formation of nanofillers; therefore, it covers the entire aerogels from transmitting 
heat and pyrolysis, as shown in Figure 13.10. The protective layer further formed 
will prevent volatile gases from emerging from the aerogel matrix and inhibit flame 
subsequently. 
13.5.1 NC/INORGANIC NC-BASED AEROGELS 
Nanocellulose(NC) is obtained from plant cell walls through chemical and mechan￾ical methods to form nanocrystals and nanofibrils or from microorganisms through a 
bottom-up process resulting in bacterial cellulose (Muhammad et al. 2021). NC 
aerogel has plentiful internal pores; hence, it can excellently perform as a thermal 
FIGURE 13.10 Formation of a flame retardant layer on 
NC aerogel ( Kovačević, Flinčec Grgac, and Bischof 2021). 
Flame-Retardant Green Aerogels 361 insulator. However, the high porosity weakens the mechanical properties like 
toughness and strength and makes it a highly brittle material. These drawbacks of 
NC can be rectified by reinforcing it with nanoparticles of graphene, clay, organic 
polymers, cellulose whisker, metal nanoparticles, or other related mixtures. Another 
concern is that it decomposes when exposed to a temperature range of 200°C–260°C; 
this, in turn, releases volatile gases like CO, methane, and ethylene, which further 
accelerates burning. When it comes to flame-retardant application, the above-said 
additives cannot contribute much to extinguishing the flame once it is ignited. Here 
it requires additional functionalization to prevent the propagation of flame. Green 
materials such as graphene oxide, magnesium hydroxide, montmorillonite, and se￾piolite are found to be a good choice as additives showing flame-extinguishing 
properties (C. He et al. 2018). 
The inherent flammability of NC aerogels possesses a high risk of fire hazards, 
which are very hard to extinguish once aerogel material is ignited. The hydro￾philicity and lower mechanical strength are the other concerns when choosing 
NC as aerogel base material. The only way to overcome this difficulty is by the 
usage of inorganic nanofillers, which could hinder the flame propagation and 
functionalization to strengthen and make it hydrophilic. The most commonly 
considered method was to use inorganic particles as flame-retardant fillers to im￾prove the fire resistance of cellulose porous materials, such as aluminium hydroxide 
nanoparticles, magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles, and reduced graphene oxide/ 
ZrP composite(S. Jiang et al. 2021). Boron-containing materials, like boric acid, 
zinc borate, and borax, are efficient cellulose flame retardants. 
Since nanocellulose is hydrophilic, it tends to form aggregates when mixed 
with hydrophobic solvents (Z. Song, Xiao, and Zhao 2014). The availability of 
hydroxyl groups on the surface and the hydrophilic nature of nanocellulose makes 
it a good choice as a hydrogel structural element. However, the incorporation of 
NC with petro-based plastics as reinforcement has not yet been successfully 
achieved. The high strength and porosity of the NC aerogels, which are com￾petent with conventional silica aerogels and the flexibility and strength they offer, 
unlike silica, make them a suitable alternative in many applications (X. Yang and 
Cranston 2014). 
Even though the additives, such as halogen and phosphorous, can impart fire￾retardant properties in aerogels made of petro-based polymers like polystyrene 
(Briga-Sá et al. 2013), polyethylene (Kaynakli 2012), and urethane (Kumar and 
Suman 2013), their burning will release toxic gases, which are of great concern 
due to the adverse environmental impacts and health issues produced (Dietz et al. 
2013; Brehme et al. 2014). Although NC aerogels have very low density, good 
mechanical strength, heat-resistant properties, and sustainability, the inherent 
flammable nature is a big issue when it comes to flame-retardant applications 
(Dorez et al. 2013). 
Metal nanoparticles are found to be excellent inorganic nanofillers that could 
effectively improve the mechanical strength of the aerogel matrix alongside their 
pollution-free nature. Chenglin He et al. used aluminum hydroxide (AH) as an 
inorganic filler on waste cotton, as a nanocellulose source, to impart its flame￾retardant properties and mechanically strengthen it. AH is a pollution-free, inert, 
362 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications and nontoxic flame retardant material; hence, it will not produce any secondary 
pollution. Upon burning, aerogel made of cotton is completely burned without any 
retardancy, even after the removal of flame; but, the AH NPs@cellulose composite 
aerogels self-extinguish once the flame is removed and the remaining portion of the 
aerogel is maintained intact. The size of nanoparticles holds a major role in the 
inhibition of flame, the lower the particle size higher will be the flame retardancy. 
Among the samples prepared, the sample with the highest amount of AH nano￾particles (~140 phr) exhibited a lower total heat release (THR) of 1.6 kJ/g and peak 
of heat release rate (PHRR) of 22 W/g against 13.2 kJ/g and 280 W/g of cellulose 
aerogel respectively (C. He et al. 2018). Table 13.2 shows the heat release rates 
achieved by AHNPs composite aerogels. This is because the decomposition of AH 
NPs started much before the decomposition temperature (in the range 
210°C–330°C) of NC aerogel, thereby forming a char layer on the aerogel; this, in 
turn, inhibits further pyrolysis of the inner layers of the aerogel. This gives the 
aerogel improved thermal and fire retardation at elevated temperatures (~400°C) 
compared to pristine NC aerogels. This improved the compressive strength to 1.5 
MPa from 0.08 MPa earlier (C. He et al. 2018). 
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are two-dimensional materials that possess 
excellent flame retardancy, modifiable surface chemistry, smoke reduction by 
suppression, and sustainable nature (X. Luo et al. 2020). Xiaolei Luo et. al. 
prepared MgAl-layered double hydroxide (MgAl-CO3 LDH (MA-C) and MgAl￾H2PO4 LDH (MA-P) as green nanofillers and flame retardants. Six samples of 
MA-C and MA-P are prepared with varying weight percentages of 0.6, 1.2, and 
1.8 along with a pure form of cellulose aerogel (CA). The combustion behaviour 
was then assessed by the limited oxygen index (LOI) and cone calorimetry test. It 
is observed that with the increase in MA-C and MA-P the LOI value was in￾creased and was found to be 35.42% and 36.25% for CAC-3 (1.8 wt%) and CAP￾3 (1.8 wt%) respectively as against 18% for CA (X. Luo et al. 2020). Upon 
CONE calorimetry test, the flammable behaviour of the CA could be observed 
with a peak of heat release (PHRR) of 116.34 kW/m2
. With the addition of MA-C 
and MA-P the PHRR could be reduced by 41% and 50% (Table 13.2). The peak 
heat release rate is delayed due to the decomposition of LDH into char and 
prevents the aerogel from further burning. Smoke production ratio (SPR) value 
for CA, SPR peak of 0.053m2
/s at 20.5 s is observed as compared to CAP-2 
which shows SPR peak of 0.011 m2
/s. 
Halogenated compounds, an organic flame retardant, possess high flame re￾tardancy. However, the environmental impacts and health issues it could produce 
hampered their wide usage. A suitable flame retardant that could replace 
halogen is phosphorus-based materials (Salmeia et al. 2016). Upon heating, the 
phosphorus-based FR can dehydrate cellulose to actively produce a char layer 
over the aerogel. DOPO (9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenantherne-10-oxide) 
is a phosphorous-containing FR, which shows excellent flame-retardant ability, 
less toxicity, good thermal stability, and outstanding oxidation resistance. Jiali 
Huang et al. prepared an aerogel using NC and DOPO-IA, a phosphorus￾containing FR. DOPO-IA was incorporated into NC aerogel in different quantities 
(Huang et al. 2021). CN aerogels with amounts of 15%, 20%, and 25% DOPO-IA

364 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications were prepared. With higher amounts of DOPO-IA, the density of the aerogel is 
increased due to improved crosslinking density. When looking into the char re￾sidue, 25% DOPO-IA added CN aerogel showed a 19.8% amount at 700°C, 
which is the highest among all other samples. This has also enhanced the me￾chanical strength, but the thermal conductivity is not affected in any way. When 
coming to the FR with the increase in additive, the char formation is found to be 
increased. Hence, it showed self-extinguishing behaviour, which is highly needed 
in any FR material. With the increase of the addition amount of DOPO-IA, the 
THR and PHRR are found to be decreased substantially along with char for￾mation (Table 13.2). 
A blending of two or more categories of fibres obtained from different sources 
could have mixed properties. In that way, any natural occurring fibre with FR 
properties can be imparted to NC by simply mixing with it. A promising FR 
material in such a perspective is alginate fibres, which have an LOI value of 
48.0% as compared to NC. A blend of alginate with any other fibre materials can 
be made to impart FR characteristics. To make such a composite form, Yun Liu 
et al. prepared a viscose/alginate fibre blend, which is both biodegradable and 
available at a very low cost, to make a nonwoven fabric with FR characteristics. 
Viscose fibres are regenerated cellulose fibres which find applications in textile, 
automobile, and construction fields considering their nontoxic nature and bio￾degradability. However, like NC, viscose fibres are also not fire resistant and have 
an LOI of 19% (Y. Liu et al. 2020). Three samples of viscose/alginate fibres 
are prepared with the weight ratio of 80/20, 50/50, and 20/80, along with viscose 
fibre only. The thermal stability of the viscose/alginate fibres is found to be 
much improved at high temperatures (~700°C) with a char residue of 14.35% for 
the 50/50 sample against 1.82% of viscose, as shown in Table 13.2. The PHRR 
and THR values are also greatly decreased with the addition of alginate. The 
woven method also affected the flame retardancy greatly as the nonwoven fabric 
has a large gap between fibres which increases the thermal conductivity. 
13.5.2 CHITIN AND CHITOSAN-BASED AEROGELS 
Chitin is extracted from crustaceans like crab and shrimp. Chitosan is deacetylated 
form of chitin and consists of hydrophilic hydroxyl and amino groups, which can be 
easily modified to impart particular properties (Muhammad et al. 2021). Chitosan 
(CS) is an amino-polysaccharide having abundant hydroxyl and amino groups, 
which contribute to the enhanced charring, hence improved thermal insulation 
properties (J. Zhu et al. 2020). The limitation of chitosan like dissolution in acids, 
low surface area, poor solubility, and gelation in water hinders its usage in aerogel 
form without proper modification (Muhammad et al. 2021). However, it has many 
favourable characteristics as an aerogel material, like higher surface area, molecular 
weight distribution, and accessibility of the amine functional groups. The additives 
used in chitosan are explained in the coming sessions and the properties achieved 
are shown in Table 13.2. 
The compatibility of CS with inorganic salts facilitates amino groups to form 
complexes with metal ions that control the swelling properties of CS. Considering 
Flame-Retardant Green Aerogels 365 the solubility of chitosan in an acidic environment and its three-dimensional (3D) 
networks, Zhaoyun Yang et al. prepared chitosan-aluminum/PVA (CAP) aerogels 
using the ambient pressure-drying (APD) method (Z. Yang et al. 2021). Seven 
samples having varying amounts of AlCl3 and AIP are prepared. The sample 
containing the most amounts of inorganic constituent showed maximum LOI; 
hence, it is more fire-resistant. The sample CA1.5P-AIP15 (PVA/g – 4, 
AlCl3⋅6H2O/ g – 1.5 and AIP/mL – 15) showed a maximum LOI value of 41.1% as 
against 26.8% of CP. Thus, it is obvious that aluminium compounds formed 
compact char and retarded the flame by suppressing the smoke formed oxygen and 
heat transfer. The THR value and PHRR values are also found to be lesser for a 
sample having the highest alumina content. 
Another form of alginate, sodium alginate (SA), is a polysaccharide biopolymer 
obtained from seaweed. Unlike NC, it is inherently fire retardant due to its hydroxyl 
and carboxyl groups, which form a carbonization layer upon heating and halt the 
propagation of flame (H. He et al. 2021). However, the brittle nature of CS is a big 
concern, which can be overcome by proper cross-linking with any bio-based binders 
like 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) and sodium hypophosphite (SHP) 
to impart its flexibility. With that in mind, He et al. prepared a lightweight and 
porous sodium alginate/carboxymethyl cellulose/chitosan polysaccharide-based 
composite aerogels (SCC-B) by freeze-drying and post-cross-linking technology. 
Four samples are prepared with varying amounts of BTCA and SA/CMC/CS (SCC) 
in the mass ratios 0:10, 1:10, 2:10, and 3:10. The ester cross-linking enabled 
phosphorylation of polysaccharides which, therefore, improved the thermal stability 
due to the formation of the carbonization layer. The formation of residues and 
nonflammable substances was observed during heating of the specimens and is 
attributed to the effective catalysing of it by BTCA, thereby acidification and de￾hydration of the aerogels occurred. The CO2 emission resulting from the burning of 
aerogels diluted the oxygen surrounding it, thereby the fire could be effectively 
extinguished. 
Hydroxyapatite (HAP) is an inorganic material mainly found in teeth and 
bones as the main component. HAP exhibits good thermal compatibility and 
nontoxicity; hence, it can be incorporated with polysaccharides to impart me￾chanical strength and thermal resistance. Since its melting point is above 1000°C 
and contains phosphorus content higher than any other FR, it could act as an 
excellent FR (J. Zhu et al. 2020). However, the weight percentage of HAP should 
be more than 20 wt% to impart favourable properties, which in turn produces 
another issue of difficulty in maintaining uniform dispersion of nano HAP in 
chitosan solution. Jundong Zhu et al. prepared a composite aerogel using chitosan 
and hydroxyapatite with a directional freezing technique. The HAP is modified to 
improve the dispersion in composite gel formation using a silane coupling agent 
(APTES) for adding amino groups to the surface to form HAP-Si. For imparting 
better crosslinking the process is proceeded with adding glutaraldehyde (G), and 
samples with and without G are prepared in different mass ratios of HAP-Si and 
CS or CSG. With the increase in HAP-Si, content the mechanical strength of the 
composite aerogel was found to be increased; however, this leads to the thick￾ening of cell walls and a loss of porosity. 
366 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications Imparting self-healing property by the formation of dynamic covalent bonds 
and supramolecular interactions between various constituents in an aerogel net￾work is an innovative way to halt any fire hazards (J. Y. Yang et al. 2020). Ji-Yu 
Yang et al. developed biomass aerogels by electrostatically assembling chitosan 
(CS), phytic acid (PA), and itaconic acid (IA). The aerogel skeleton showed self￾healing property because the interaction between the amine groups (CS) and 
carboxyl groups (IA) was weak electrostatically. Both CS and PA could form 
char layers due to the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and amino groups 
(CS), and six phosphate groups (PA). Thus, it is obvious that integration of the 
3D skeleton could impart flame retardancy and self-healing ability to the aerogels. 
By re-dissolving and re-shaping processes, these materials also can be easily 
recycled; hence, their sustainability is guaranteed (J. Y. Yang et al. 2020). 
13.5.3 STARCH-BASED AEROGELS 
Among diverse natural polysaccharides, starch has gained increasing research in￾terest for aerogel fabrication. It is nonallergenic, nontoxic, and generally recognized 
as safe, abundant, and cheap. Starch is found in the granular and semi-crystalline 
forms in nature. The size of starch granules from different plants varies from 1 to 
100 µm(F. Zhu 2019). Starch-based aerogels can be prepared into various shapes 
and sizes, such as monolith, film, and microsphere, ranging from nanoscale to 
micron-sized (Zheng et al. 2020). 
Starch is a homopolysaccharide composed of glucose. Starch can be of two 
types: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose is made up of (1 → 4)-linked α-D-gluco￾pyranosyl units and is a linear starch molecule. It accounts for the mesoporous 
structure and higher surface area of the starch aerogels. Amylopectin is made up of 
α- D-glucopyranosyl units, a highly-branched starch molecules. Amylose gives 
amorphous behaviour to starch granules, and amylopectin provides crystalline be￾haviour (Zheng et al. 2020). Starch exhibited very low density (0.10 g/cm3
–0.24 g/ 
cm3
) and thermal conductivity in the range 0.024 W/m·K–0.043 W/m·K, which is 
lower and suitable for thermal insulating applications. Forming aerogel the starch 
content should be in the range of 5–15 wt%, below which the gel formation will not 
take place and above which dense aerogel structure with superior mechanical 
strength is formed. But the increase in density would affect the thermal insulating 
property as it could conduct more heat. 
13.5.4 LIGNIN-BASED AEROGELS 
Lignin is the second-most abundant polysaccharide present in biomass. It is 
composed of three different types of phenylpropane units and various functional 
groups, such as ether, hydroxyl, methoxy, aldehyde, and ester groups. Therefore, 
it exhibits a very rigid, hyperbranched macromolecular structure (C. Wang et al. 
2016). The chemical composition of cellulosic fibres greatly affects its FR 
properties because the presence of lignin could improve char formation (Salmeia 
et al. 2016). However, the lignin content should not exceed a certain limit (~10 wt 
%) for the char formation to take place during thermal decomposition processes. 
Flame-Retardant Green Aerogels 367 Increasing the lignin content will adversely affect FR property as it could de￾polymerise the aerogel structure. 
13.6 CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK 
Aerogels are solid porous materials gaining importance these days considering 
their extent of application in many engineering and medical fields. It is made by 
the sol-gel process accompanied by an appropriate drying technique, mainly 
supercritical drying and freeze-drying techniques. With increasing concerns over 
sustainability and global warming, the use of natural biodegradable materials as 
aerogel base materials, in which NC, chitin, starch, and lignin were recently 
found to be structurally strong enough and chemically modifiable to any extent 
for use in multiple applications especially as a thermal insulator and flame re￾tardant. NC is found to be the most studied polysaccharide, and most abundantly 
available, among others in the field of flame retardancy and thermal insulation 
applications owing to its abundance, low cost, and extent of functionalization. 
The flame retardancy and thermal insulation applications of such aerogels are 
found to be increasing day by day due to their environment-friendly and nontoxic 
nature. However, unlike NC aerogels other polysaccharides such as starch, lignin, 
and other upcoming polysaccharides are not yet completely explored in FR and 
thermal applications. 
A lot of research in this field is being carried out to use many types of inorganic 
and organic nanofillers and for physiochemical modification to structurally strengthen 
it and to be used in many futuristic fields such as energy storage application, water 
filtration and medical applications through appropriate modifications.

Environmental pollution is one of the serious threats that society faces every day. 
The modern urbanization and industrialization processes not only deplete the natural 
fossil fuels such as petroleum and its derivative but also produce large amounts of 
pollutants that are released in water, soil, and air and pollute environment and cause 
detrimental effects on human health and the surrounding environment (Kampa and 
Castanas 2008; Manisalidis et al. 2020). Different types of pollution and their main 
sources are classified in Figure 14.1. Generated pollutants are released into the en￾vironment in different forms, for example, industrial effluent (Jaishankar et al. 2014; 
Muhammad et al. 2016) contains heavy metals such as arsenic, lead, cadmium, 
chromium, mercury, etc.; atmospheric pollution (Eljarrat et al. 2020) is caused by the 
toxic gases such as carbon oxides, ozone, sulfur, nitrogen oxide, etc. and suspended 
airborne particles; and volatile organic compounds, while soil pollutants (Kumar 
Sharma, Agrawal, and Marshall 2007) may comprise organic and inorganic sub￾stances such as synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides, hydrocarbons, phenols, 
etc., as well as microbial pathogens. These environmental pollutants greatly affect 
human health when they enter the human body either through inhalation, ingestion, 
or absorption through the skin. These pollutants tend to accumulate in food chains, 
such as the bioaccumulation of heavy metals (B. Hu et al. 2020; Dutta et al. 2022) 
which causes major risks to humans and wildlife. 
Day-to-day new technologies are being explored for the remediation of pollutants 
in water, soil, and air. (Tran, Reinhard, and Gin 2018). Several techniques have 
been developed to resolve the issues related to improving water, for example, reverse 
osmosis(Shanmuganathan et al. 2016), electrodialysis (Vyas et al. 2000) ion￾exchange membrane filtration(Y. Zhang et al. 2018), nanofiltration, biological de￾gradation (G.-J. Zhou et al. 2014), etc. to reduce or remove the content of pollutant 
in water to make water clean and drinkable. However, these methods have several 
disadvantages such as high energy demand, slow response, sensitivity, and high 
FIGURE 14.1 Types of environmental pollution and their major sources. 
378 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications operating cost. Much research has been conducted on eco-friendly and sustainable 
resources to overcome the world’s largest threats. Over the last few years, different 
types of biobased materials are implemented for environmental remediation purposes. 
Chitosan and its derivatives gained so much scientific attention since the last 
century. Chitosan is a modified biopolymer of polyaminosaccharide. It is synthesized 
from chitin (which is the second most abundant natural organic material on the earth) 
consisting of unbranched chains of β-(1, 4)2-acetoamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose by 
deacetylation. Chitosan has a stronger affinity to many organic or inorganic com￾pounds due to abundant amino and hydroxyl groups compared to chitin, which 
benefits its applications in many fields such as wastewater treatment, agriculture, 
pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and food industry (Sarode et al. 2019). The structure of 
chitin and chitosan is shown in Figure 14.2. 
Due to some limitations of raw chitosan (powder and flakes), there has been a 
growing interest in modifying the chitosan to improve the original properties and 
broaden the applications. Different forms of modified chitosan are nanochitosan, 
chitosan/biopolymer blend, chitosan hydrogels, chitosan beads, chitosan/nano￾particles composites. Recently, the use of nanosized material (at least one dimen￾sion is in nanosized) has increased remarkably compared to the traditional micro￾sized materials due to their better performance. The nanosized materials have a 
large surface area, more porosity, and quantum size effect (L. Zhang, Zeng, and 
Cheng 2016). Nanochitosan is a form of chitosan that has characteristics of chitosan 
and unique physiochemical properties such as environment-friendly, cost-effective, 
high crystallinity, large surface area, significant chemical reactivity, and ease of 
functionalization which can enhance their utilization for eliminating or to remove 
the pollutants from water, soil, and air. Therefore, this chapter places prominence

Herein, we discuss commonly used preparation methods and various recent applica￾tions of nanochitosan in wastewater treatment for removing the contaminants such as 
heavy metals, organics/inorganics dyes, salts, biological contaminants, etc.). Soil and air 
remediation using nanochitosan materials is also explained in this chapter. The chapter 
ends with a discussion on current challenges for the use of nanochitosan to broaden its 
scope in environmental remediation and its future perspective at the industrial level. 
14.2 NANOCHITOSAN 
Chitosan has the ability to easily form a gel, beads, microparticles, nanofibers, 
nanoparticles, and membranes (Sivakami et al. 2013). Chitosan-based nanomater￾ials have attracted notable interest as they are environmentally friendly materials 
with superior physiochemical properties such as larger surface area, high crystal￾linity, and high chemical reactivity and quantum size effects that can enhance their 
use as nanocatalysts and nanosorbents in many applications. In addition to these, 
they are also applied to improve the strength and washability of textiles products 
and contribute to antibacterial properties (Ting, DR and Shen 2005). Moreover, 
nanochitosan has been used as a drug carrier in controlled release therapy for gene 
transfer in artificial organs (Huang, Sheu, and Chao 2009). Chitosan nanoparticles 
are formed due to the interaction between the macromolecules of opposite charges. 
Chitosan nanoparticles were first investigated by Ohya et al. in 1994. They prepared 
nanoparticles by crosslinking and emulsifying methods (Ohya et al. 1994). After that, 
various methods are used for the synthesis of chitosan nanoparticles. Currently used 
methods are shown in Figure 14.3. The major methods are classified as ionotropic 
FIGURE 14.3 Different types of methods for synthesis of chitosan nanoparticles. 
380 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications gelation, microemulsion, co-precipitation, emulsion droplet coalescence methods, poly￾electrolyte complex, and reverse micellar methods (Huang, Sheu, and Chao 2009). 
14.2.1 IONOTROPIC GELATION 
This method is widely used because it is simple, nontoxic, easy, and organic solvent 
free to get desired size particles. Calvo et al. (1997) reported this method for the 
first time (P. Calvo, C. Remuñán-López, J. L. Vila-Jato 1997). In this method, 
negatively charged polyanion crosslinker such as tripolyphosphate (TPP) interact 
with the positively charged amine group of chitosan by electrostatic force. An 
aqueous acidic solution of chitosan is prepared and then polyanion, TPP solution is 
added dropwise under constant stirring at room temperature. Anionic TPPs are 
crosslink with chitosan nanoparticles and used as a nanocarrier for suitable con￾trolled drug delivery. (Debnath, Subhashis, R. Suresh Kumar 2011). 
Sivakami M.S. et al. prepared chitosan nanoparticles using ionotropic gelation 
method for chromium removal from wastewater treatment where these nano￾particles crosslink low molecular weight chitosan with polyanion sodium TPP 
(Sivakami et al. 2013). 
Wong and Kuo prepared the chitosan nanoparticles by ionic gelation using 
polyacrylic acid. They reported in their study that the effective maximum capacity 
for the removal of nickel was 435 mg/g, which was better compared to micro-sized 
chitosan followed the Langmuir isotherm equation (J.-W. Wang and Kuo 2008). 
Recently, K. Vijayalakhmi et al. synthesized nanochitosan/sodium alginate/mi￾crocrystalline cellulose beads for lead (Pb) II removal using TPP as an anionic 
crosslinker. They reported that the optimum pH for Pb (II) adsorption was 6 at 50°C 
with 62.5 mg/L initial metal concentration (Vijayalakshmi et al. 2017). Likewise, 
other work reported by Farid et al., in which they used chitosan and sodium tri￾phosphate as a crosslinking agent for the synthesis of nanochitosan and used it as a 
flocculating agent for harvesting microalga Nannochloropsis sp. When nanochi￾tosan was used as a flocculant instead of chitosan, the flocculant was reduced by 
40%, while biomass recovery increased by 9% (Farid et al. 2013). 
14.2.2 CO-PRECIPITATION METHOD 
In this method, chitosan nanoparticles are prepared using low pH acidic solution, 
such as acetic acid, and a high pH solution such as sodium hydroxide/ammonium 
hydroxide to get monodisperse nanoparticles. 
Yuwei Chen and Jianlong Wang, prepared the magnetic chitosan nanoparticles by 
a simple co-precipitation method. Synthesized nanoparticles showed better sorption 
performance for removing Cu (II) from an aqueous solution. They reported that the 
maximum sorption capacity for Cu (II) was 35.5 mg/g using the Langmuir isotherm 
(Yuwei and Jianlong 2011). Also, Chitosan-coated iron oxide nanoparticles were 
prepared by Wulandari et al using this co-precipitation method (Wulandari et al. 
2018). The formation of magnetic chitosan nanoparticles by co-precipitation and 
emulsifier method is shown in Figure 14.4, (a) and (b), respectively. 
Trends in Nanochitosan-Based Materials 381 14.3 NANOCHITOSAN-BASED MATERIALS FOR WATER 
REMEDIATION 
Due to the presence of amino and hydroxyl groups, chitosan and its derivatives 
become popular materials in water purification. Various types of research have been 
conducted on chitosan and its derivatives for the removal of various pollutants such 
as heavy metals, organic dyes, salts, etc. from water and wastewater (Muhammad 
Zubair, Arshad, and Ullah 2020). Researchers indicated that chitosan nanomaterials 
have shown higher adsorption capacity in water purification than traditionally used 
micro-sized chitosan materials for the removal of heavy metals because of their 
higher surface area and better reactivity (Sivakami et al. 2013).

using an emulsifier (b). [Reproduced with permission from John Wiley and Sons (publisher) 
( Shaumbwa et al. 2021)]. 
382 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 14.3.1 HEAVY METALS 
Heavy metals and dyes are the major pollutants in industrial wastewater. If their 
concentration is higher than recommended concentration set by WHO or the gov￾ernment standards, they can be very toxic and harmful to humans and living or￾ganisms. Nanomaterials are very effective adsorbents for heavy metal removal due 
to their large surface areas, and higher reactivity for pollutant adsorption. Chitosan 
nanoparticles/nanocomposites have been used to adsorbs heavy metals ions such as 
As, Pb, Cu, Ni, Ag, etc., and other precious metals like Pd, Au, Pt, etc. 
Haider and Park prepared chitosan nanofiber by electrospinning, the results in￾dicated that the equilibrium adsorption capacities for Cu (II) and Pb (II) were 
485.44 mg/g and 263.15 mg/g, respectively according to the Langmuir isotherm 
method without changing its inhered characteristics such as bioactivity, non￾toxicity, and biocompatibility (Haider and Park 2009). 
Seyed Masoud Seyedi et. al., investigated the adsorption of cadmium (Cd) from 
water using nanochitosan and chitosan. They reported that the maximum adsorption 
capacity of nanochitosan was 358 mg/g compared to chitosan for which it was 153 
mg/g by using the Langmuir model (Seyedi et al. 2013). 
Recently, Jinyun Liu et al., reported novel adsorbent, biomimetics SiO2-chitosan 
composite with high adsorbent capacity toward As (V) and Hg (II) from drinking 
water. They prepared chitosan nanoparticles coated with SiO2 leaf-like structure 
prevents agglomeration and chitosan loss and provides a better interaction between 
chitosan functional groups and heavy metal ions. The composite had maximum ad￾sorption capacities for Hg (II) was 204.1 mg/g and for As (V) was 198.6 mg/g, fur￾thermore, within 2 mins the removal efficiency reaches over 60% (J. Liu et al. 2019). 
Kong et al. prepared chitosan metal ion nanoparticles by adding sodium phytate 
followed by centrifugation. Synthesized chitosan nanoparticles adsorption capacity 
at different adsorption conditions were tested for Cu (II) and Ni (II) ions. The 
maximum adsorption of Cu (II) and Ni (II) ions were 405 mg/g and 315 mg/g, 
respectively according to the Langmuir model at pH 5.2 and temperature of 30°C. 
They also mentioned that adsorption capacities were many times higher than the 
pure chitosan resin (Kong et al. 2018). 
Recently, magnetic chitosan nanoparticles were investigated for water purifica￾tion because of their simplicity, high separation efficiency, cost-effectiveness, low 
toxicity, and very good superparamagnetism. X. Liu et. al. synthesized magnetic 
chitosan nanocomposite on the basis of amine factionalized magnetic nanoparticles. 
They indicated that the interaction between chitosan and metal ions was reversible 
under a weak acidic condition which makes nanocomposites fast quite efficient and 
these nanocomposites conveniently remove Pb2+ and Cu2+ and Cd2+ from waste￾water. The results indicated that the nanocomposite showed the removal efficiency 
for Pb2+ was about 95% within 10 mins using ultrasound radiation and retained 
efficiency in 40 mins. For cadmium and copper, it was 89% and 92%, respectively 
(X. Liu et al. 2009). 
Similarly, Zhou et al. synthesized ethylenediamine-functionalized magnetic 
chitosan nanoparticles by precipitation into the water in oil (W/O) microemulsion 
method. The nanoparticles were tested for adsorption of precious metal ions: Pd (II) 
Trends in Nanochitosan-Based Materials 383 and Pt (IV). The results indicated that the prepared nanoparticles were good sor￾bents as the maximum adsorption loading capacity shown for Pd (II) was 171 mg/g 
and for Pt (IV) was 138 mg/g (L. Zhou et al. 2010). 
Chang and Chen reported a novel magnetic nanoadsorbent for the removal of 
heavy metal ions. Monodisperse chitosan Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared by 
carboxymethylated chitosan and covalently attached to the surface Fe3O4 nano￾particles through carbodiimide. Prepared nanoparticles were tested for adsorption of 
Cu (II) showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 21.5 mg/g followed by the 
Langmuir adsorption method. 
Thinh et al. synthesized magnetic chitosan nanoparticles using the co￾precipitation method followed by epichlorohydrin crosslinking reaction with an 
average size was 30 nm. The results indicated that maximum adsorption capacity at 
pH 3 was 55.80 mg/g calculated using the Langmuir isotherm model and they 
mentioned that magnetic chitosan nanoparticles could serve as a better adsorbent for 
Cr (VI) from wastewater (Thinh et al. 2013). 
Li et al. prepared novel nanoabsorbents, graphene oxide-based magnetic 
cyclodextrin-chitosan (CCGO) for Cr (VI) removal. They reported the maximum 
adsorption capacity of 67.7 mg/g using the Langmuir isotherm model and re￾generation data showed that after five cycles, only 5% of capacity loss was occurred 
(L. Li et al. 2013). 
Recently, Chen et al. synthesized a novel Fe3O4-chitosan/EDTA bifunctional 
absorbent by glutaraldehyde crosslinking coupled through amidation reaction. The 
prepared adsorbent tested for methylene blue (MB) dye, Cu (II), and Pb (II). The 
results revealed sorption capacities of Cu (II) was 225 mg/g, Pb (II) was 220, and for 
MB was 459.9 mg/g according to the Langmuir isotherm model (Chen et al. 2019). 
14.3.2 ORGANIC POLLUTANTS 
Major organic pollutants are being generated from several industries such as che￾mical, pharmaceutical, fertilizers, textile, cosmetics, printing, pulp and paper, dis￾charged into the environment. Main organic pollutants are organic dyes, pesticides, 
detergents, hydrocarbons, and phenols. There are many reports on chitosan and its 
derivatives used for the removal of dyes from industrial wastewater. Chitosan-based 
nanomaterials have been investigated a lot for removing toxic dyes wherein hy￾droxyl groups used in dye adsorption and the amine groups remain as an active 
group for other biopolymer activity. 
Hu et al. prepared nanochitosan by using chitosan and sodium tripolyphosphate 
(TPP) through the gelation method. The adsorption capacity of nanochitosan was 
determined for the Acid Green 27(AG 27) dye of anthraquinone. The results 
showed adsorption capacity of nanochitosan was greater than micro-sized chitosan 
(Z. G. Hu et al. 2006). 
Zinc oxide nanoparticles were prepared via immobilization onto chitosan and 
used for the determination of adsorption capacities of nanoparticles for direct blue 
78 (DB78) and acid black 26 (AB26). The results showed adsorption capacities 
were 34.5 mg/g and 52.6 mg/g, respectively for direct blue 78 and acid black 26 
according to the Langmuir isotherm model (Salehi et al. 2010). 
384 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications Zhou et al. prepared ethylenediamine–functionalized magnetic chitosan nano￾particles (EMCN) and tested for the removal of Acid Orange 7 and Acid Orange 10 
dyes. The nanoparticles EMCN exhibited adsorption of 3.47 mmol/g for Acid 
Orange 7 and 2.25 mmol/g for Acid Orange 10 using the Langmuir isotherm model 
(L. Zhou et al. 2011). 
Fan et al. studied β–cyclodextrin–chitosan (CDC) modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles 
(CDCM) for adsorption of MB dye. The adsorption capacity of MB was estimated 
at 30°C as 2.78 g/g, and the data were well fitted with the pseudo–second-order 
model. They indicated that sorbent is recyclable as it showed 90% adsorption after 
four cycles (L. Fan et al. 2012). 
Further in their work, Fan et al. investigated loading efficiency of MB dye by 
CDC supported on graphene oxide (MCCG) and then they compared it with bare 
CDC. Results revealed that MCCG has a stronger dye uptake due to a large surface 
area of GO and hydrophobicity of β–cyclodextrin and functional group of chitosan 
than bare CDC. MB dye removal adsorption capacity of MCCG was 84.3 mg/g and 
50.1 mg/g for bare CDC using the pseudo–second-order kinetics model. The na￾nocomposite showed good cyclic stability up to five cycles (L. Fan et al. 2013). 
Recently, Kumar et al. prepared biobased chitosan-based nanocomposite using 
chitosan, poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and ZnO (CS/PVA/ZnO) nanocomposite via a 
solution casting method. The green nanocomposite film prepared with CS/PVA/ 
ZnO showed higher adsorption capacity toward acid black 1 (AB 1) in an aqueous 
solution and suggested that the presence of ZnO increased the adsorption ability of 
the film. The CS/PVA/ZnO nanocomposite showed excellent photoluminescent 
properties than CS/PVA film (Kumar et al. 2019). 
Xu et al. prepared chitosan-based novel adsorbent by surface grafting of poly(2- 
(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) on magnetic chitosan microspheres for anionic 
dyes (e.g., Acid Green 25 and Reactive Blue 19) adsorption from water. The adsorption 
capacity of adsorbent toward acid green 25 and Reactive blue 19 was better than 
magnetic chitosan microspheres due to electrostatic interactions between cationic ter￾tiary amine functional groups and dye molecules, and hydrogen bonding was estab￾lished between the dye secondary amine groups and ester carbonyl group of the grafted 
polymer. They also indicated that the recovery efficiency of adsorbent is high about 
90% after five cycles of regeneration (Xu et al. 2018). 
14.3.3 DESALINATION 
It is a process to remove salts and minerals from saline water. Commonly, desa￾lination is categorized into membrane- or thermal-based desalination. Membrane￾based desalination includes reverse osmosis, electro dialysis, and membrane dis￾tillation. Currently, the usage of membrane-based technology has increased because 
of the better contaminant’s removal, longer filtration media life, higher efficiency, 
smaller footprint, and easy of operating (Obotey Ezugbe and Rathilal 2020; 
Muhammad Zubair, Arshad, and Ullah 2021). Nanochitosan is one of the promising 
materials to be used in desalination applications as it can be easily modified for the 
desirable characteristics (Saha et al. 2019; M Zubair, Arshad, and Ullah 2020; 
Muhammad Zubair and Ullah 2021). 
Trends in Nanochitosan-Based Materials 385 Shakeri et al. reported a membrane derived from chitosan for forward osmosis 
(FO) desalination process. Membranes were synthesized by the addition of trime￾soyl chloride (TMC) monomer that showed higher hydrophilicity and water per￾meation compared to commercial thin film composite (TFC) membrane. The results 
revealed that a dense thick active layer was formed due to higher chitosan contents 
and NaOH concentration, which improved membrane performance in salt rejection 
(Shakeri, Salehi, and Rastgar 2017). In a recent study, TFC polyester amide na￾nofiltration membrane was prepared from carboxylated chitosan and TMC. The 
study indicated separation performance was enhanced at higher concentration of 
carboxylated chitosan because of the post-curing at 40°C and 15–20 minutes. 
However, at a low concentration of carboxylated chitosan, permeation flux and salt 
rejection of the membrane were improved. Furthermore, the incorporation of 
benzyl-triethylammonium chloride (0.025 wt%) into the aqueous solution displayed 
the most prominent factor to improve the membrane separation performance. Most 
importantly, membrane properties greatly affected the phase transfer catalysts and 
its uniform distribution was necessary to maintain the membrane performance (D. 
Wu et al. 2022). Yang et al. synthesized positively charged composite nanofiltration 
membrane by the crosslinking of chitosan and 1,3,5-triglycidyl isocyanurate on the 
polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane (B. Yang et al. 2021). The membrane was 
studied for the rejection performance of salts such as magnesium chloride (MgCl2), 
sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), and sodium chloride 
(NaCl). The membrane exhibited that a molecular weight cut off of 1500 Da 
showed the rejection higher than 90% for the polyethylene glycol. The membrane 
had a bigger pore size than previously reported chitosan-based membranes ascribed 
to higher flux rate (Miao, Zhang, and Lin 2013; X. Qian et al. 2018). The study 
concluded that average pore diameter of 1.560 nm and 0.902 nm was determined, 
which decreased with an increase in chitosan concentration. 
Ghaffar et al. prepared cellulose acetate-based membrane using chitosan nano￾particles. The membrane performance, i.e., water flux and salt rejection was eval￾uated with 35 g/L NaCl in a dead-end filtration system. The results revealed that the 
addition of chitosan nanoparticles increased the water flux from 6 to 18 L/m2
. h. 
While the salt rejection increased from 89% to 94% for membrane having 2% 
chitosan nanoparticles (Abd El-Ghaffar et al. 2020). 
Membranes have issues such as scaling or mineral deposition after the removal 
of contaminants, especially calcium, magnesium, carbonate, and sulfate stick to 
membrane’s surface in the form of CaSO4, CaCO3, and BaSO4 and limit the re￾jection of the contaminants (Jiang, Li, and Ladewig 2017). Maher et al. used the 
modified chitosan with guanidine to inhibit the scaling of calcium sulfate and 
carbonate salts. The guanidine group was used because it can enhance the chitosan 
solubility in water. The inhibition efficiency of guanidine-modified chitosan was 
assessed with CaSO4 and CaCO3 solutions for 6 hours and showed a good per￾formance at about 10 and 15 mg/L, respectively. However, flux was decreased to 
2.6% and 5% in feed water for both salts. Also, precipitation of CaSO4 improved 
from 3 to 15 minutes due to chitosan biguanidine addition. The study concluded that 
this material can be used as an efficient antiscalant during the membrane desali￾nation process (Maher et al. 2020). 
386 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 14.3.4 ANTIBACTERIAL/ANTIFOULING 
Water is one of the major resources to spread microbial pathogens particularly if the 
disinfection is performed inadequately that leads to pathogenic growth (Haramoto 
et al. 2018; H. Wang et al. 2018). These pathogens cause many infections in living 
organisms especially in humans. Currently, there is growing number of studies to 
address the microbial decontamination of water (Ashbolt 2015; Luby et al. 2015). 
Chitosan is an excellent material to disinfect the microbes contaminated water. 
Chitosan can be modified into a bacteriostatic material with high efficiency, en￾vironmentally benign nature, and prolonged life. Chitosan has the ability to act as an 
antibacterial material for water purification and as an anti-fouling agent for mem￾branes used for water decontamination. 
In a recent study, chitosan-derived cryogels were developed by Yin et al. The 
results revealed antibacterial activity against gram-negative Escherichia coli and 
gram- positive Staphylococcus aureus (Yin et al. 2021). 
Chitosan has been used to improve the anti-fouling properties of the cellulose￾based nanomembrane. Wang et al. modified the chitosan and TiO2 using dopamine 
on the cellulose substrate membrane. The membrane exhibited excellent perfor￾mance against E. coli (90.6%) and S. aureus (95.1%) (D. Wang et al. 2021) that can 
reduce the bacterial growth on the membrane surface. 
A novel chitosan/ biochar-nanosilver composite was reported by Hu et al. They 
prepared the composite using biochar-loaded silver nanoparticles and coated with 
chitosan. The composite displayed good antibacterial activity against E. coli (Z. Hu 
et al. 2019), In another study, a multifunctional chitosan-based nanocomposites were 
prepared with silver, copper nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes. Multifunctional 
nanocomposites (1% concentration and 10 mins contact time) exhibited excellent 
antimicrobial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, and a fungal strain i.e., Aspergillus 
flavus (Morsi et al. 2017). 
Chitosan has been used to remove the Microcystis aeruginosa cells from the 
drinking water. For this purpose, chitosan was converted into water-soluble form 
using quaternary ammonium salt. The M. aeruginosa cells were removed during 
chitosan quaternary ammonium salt coagulation and floc storage. The study presented 
that all cells were eliminated, and no damage was observed. The optimum dose of 1.5 
mg/L was observed at rapid mixing for 0.5 minute with 5.04 g while at slow mixing 
30 minutes and 0.20 g were found optimum. The excellent efficiency was ascribed to 
chitosan quaternary ammonium salt flocs with bigger size and compact structure 
which were readily settled. During floc storage, salt may produce reactive oxygen 
species and accelerated the M. aeruginosa cell lysis (Jin et al. 2017). 
Delezuk et al. reported a Janus micromotor-based bacteria killing approach for 
contaminated drinking water. They prepared micromotors using magnesium mi￾croparticles coated with chitosan, polymers poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) and al￾ginate. This material was tested against E. coli bacteria. The results indicated that 
micromotor-based chitosan material showed better antibacterial efficiency (96% 
i.e., 27-fold increase) as compared to static chitosan-coated microparticles within 10 
minutes (Delezuk et al. 2017). Chitosan was also used to modify the poly (ether 
imide) ultrafiltration membrane to improve its anti-fouling properties. Firstly, they 
Trends in Nanochitosan-Based Materials 387 performed phthaloylation of chitosan and then membrane was modified with 0.5–2 
wt% of N-phthaloyl chitosan. The study concluded that membrane modified with 2 
wt% of N-phthaloyl chitosan demonstrated improved antifouling properties. This 
increase was due to higher water, lower hydraulic resistance, and lower irreversible 
fouling (Kanagaraj et al. 2015). 
Chitosan has also been used along with other nanoparticles to be used as an an￾tibacterial agent. Natarajan et al. used chitosan-based films with TiO2 and Ag na￾noparticles as antibacterial agents against packaged drinking water bacterial strains 
(Natarajan et al. 2016). Antibacterial activity of the films was tested using glycocalyx 
test and mass assessment which proved their effective antibacterial action. 
14.3.5 NANOCHITOSAN FOR OIL AND WATER SEPARATION 
Considering oil and water separation is an interfacial concern, functional materials 
(as cost-effective methods) with unique wettability (super-oleophilicity or super￾oleophobicity) have been developed (H. Zhang et al. 2018). Several researchers 
have put efforts to develop the superhydrophobic and superoleophilic materials for 
oil/water separation using polytetrafluoroethylene-coated stainless steel meshes, 
silicone nanofilament-deposited polyester materials, polystyrene/silica-coated filter 
papers, micro-/nano-textured copper meshes, and so on (J. Yang et al. 2014). 
The chitosan has been used for different purposes in multiple fields (biomedical/ 
biotechnological/agricultural); however, its utilization for separating the oil and 
water is seldom reported because of its reduced mechanical stiffness, strength, and 
durability (J. Yang et al. 2014; H. Zhang et al. 2018). Still the chitosan is considered 
as an ideal material that interacts with fluorosurfactant to fabricate superhydrophilic 
and superoleophobic surfaces due to the presence of proton-able amine group. 
Some researchers fabricated the superhydrophilic and superoleophobic coatings by 
spray casting the chitosan-based nanocomposites for specifically separating the water 
from oil/water matrix with the additional benefits of anti-fouling and recycling (J. 
Yang et al. 2014). A hybrid hydrogel (with a distinct property of salt-tolerance su￾peroleophobicity) was prepared by fabrication of the nanofibrillated cellulose into 
chitosan matrix through freeze-drying method. The prepared hydrogel had high oil/ 
water separation efficiency (>99%), and good recyclability, which suggested the high 
potential for practical implications (H. Zhang et al. 2018). Another research was 
conducted to prepare the aerogel by fabrication of reduced graphene oxide reinforced 
with chitosan and then modification with perfluorodecanethiol (PFDT), concluding 
that the developed aerogel has an excellent oil/water separation behavior and pro￾mising role in remediating the oily wastewater (Cao et al. 2017). 
14.4 NANOCHITOSAN-DERIVED MATERIALS FOR SOIL 
REMEDIATION 
The soil’s environment is a tri-phasic system consisting of solid, liquid, and gas 
phases with biotic (unicellular and multicellular living organisms) and abiotic 
(mineral elements) interactions (Medina-Pérez et al. 2019). The accumulation of 
heavy metals and other contaminants in the soil’s environment released from 
388 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications various anthropogenic activities has now increased the ecological risks (Malerba 
and Cerana 2020). The increased concentrations of metal (loids) are highly toxic to 
soil microorganisms and have negative impacts on soil microbial species diversity 
(Medina-Pérez et al. 2019). Great efforts are being made and the efficient methods 
are required for the decontamination of metal-contaminated soils (Kamari, Pulford, 
and Hargreaves 2011). 
14.4.1 INORGANIC (HEAVY METAL) CONTAMINANTS 
There are two ways to recover the metal-contaminated soils (i) through extraction of 
metal complexes that involve the active removal of metal ions and (ii) through 
immobilization of metal ions (Yong et al. 2015). Besides other advantages, the 
chemical structure of chitosan permits its integration with metal ions and molecules, 
and hence leads to decontamination (Malerba and Cerana 2020). The purpose to use 
the chitin/chitosan includes the immobilization of metal ions via precipitation, 
sorption, or complexation (Yong et al. 2015). 
The monoprotic (formic, acetic, hydrochloric, and nitric) acids dissolve the 
chitosan molecules, where the chitosan becomes positively charged in acidic so￾lution, by transforming –NH2 group to a protonated amine group (–NH3+). The 
acidic chitosan is then precipitated through a phase inversion process by adding 
alkali (NaOH, KOH) to increase the pH > 6.5. The deprotonation of –NH3+ group 
takes place by hydroxide ions, and hence leads to the precipitation of chitosan 
(Yong et al. 2015). This phenomenon is used to produce porous hydrogels (Dang 
et al. 2011), beads (Rorrer, Hsien, and Way 1993), and membranes (Uragami, 
Yoshida, and Sugihara 1988). 
Zhao et al. prepared carboxylated graphene oxide/chitosan/cellulose composite 
beads for the removal of copper (Cu2+) from soil and achieved the high Cu2+ im￾mobilization efficiency by using the composite beads (Zhao et al. 2019). Qian et al. 
developed the magnetic microgels with ionized chitosan for the remediation of 
cesium-contaminated clays. The microgels efficiently adsorbed cesium (Cs) ions in 
a wide range of pH between 4 and 8 (J. Qian et al. 2020). Alsharari et al. amended 
the soil with nano-fungal chitosan for the bioremediation of heavy metals and 
achieved the higher removal efficiencies for lead (Pb2+) and Cu2+, which suggested 
that the nanochitosan assumed to have more binding sites in addition to hydroxyl 
and amino groups. The researchers further suggested that the immobilization of 
heavy metals could be attributed to the complexation, ion exchange, and surface 
precipitation (Alsharari, Tayel, and Moussa 2018). Weng et al. developed biode￾gradable and biocompatible anti-bacterial cellulose/chitosan nanofiltration mem￾branes for the rejection of salt and dye contaminants and reported that the higher 
rejection rates were achieved (Weng et al. 2017). Abasiyan et al. developed the 
nanocomposite from magnetic chitosan cross linked with κ-carrageenan for the 
removal and immobilization of Cd2+ from soil systems. The maximum adsorption 
capacity for Cd2+ onto magnetic chitosan nanocomposite increased from 750.2 to 
992.7 μmol/g, which suggested that this maximum adsorption is also attributed to 
the functional groups (carboxyl, carbonyl, and phenolic groups) contained in the 
soil organic matter (Mola Ali Abasiyan, Dashbolaghi, and Mahdavinia 2019). Low 
Trends in Nanochitosan-Based Materials 389 molecular weight chitosan derivatives have been applied in porous reactive barriers 
to remediate metal-contaminated sediments and groundwater. Both pure and 
modified chitosan has also been used to phytoremediate the metals, but the metal’s 
mobilizing mechanisms are not well understood yet (Yong et al. 2015). 
14.4.2 ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS 
Dye waste effluents are considered toxic to humans and hazardous to aquatic organisms. 
Therefore, removal of dyes from effluents is required and can be achieved through 
physical, chemical, and biological methods (M. Wu et al. 2019). Oily waste effluents and 
vegetable oil mills effluents (VOME) are also the source of environmental contamina￾tions (Anwar et al. 2015). The soils contaminated with organic contaminants can also be 
remediated with chitosan (Yong et al. 2015). Chitosan is having high sorption capacity 
for oily contaminants as it is positively charged at low pH, can be an effective coagulant 
for anionic contaminants such as dyes, tannins, humic acids, and humate-metal com￾plexes. Dye recovery by chitosan involves the neutralization of surface charge of dye 
molecules by the electrostatic attraction of –SO3 groups toward –NH3+ groups in chitosan 
molecules (Yong et al. 2015). 
Chitosan infused with enzymes (Z. Yang et al. 2010), clay (Q. Fan et al. 2007) and 
Cu hydroxide nanoparticles (Jaiswal, Chauhan, and Sankararamakrishnan 2012) has 
been used recently for the treatment of toxic organic chemicals (Phenol, Bisphenol 
A). Celis et al. prepared montmorillonite (SWy-2)–chitosan bionanocomposites 
(SW–CH) for the removal of herbicide clopyralid (3,6-dichloropyridine-2-carboxylic 
acid) from aqueous solution and soil/water suspensions. The results concluded that 
acidic soil (pH = 4.5) amendments with 5% and 10% of SW-CH increase the clo￾pyralid adsorption significantly. However, the adsorption is negligible when SW–CH 
was added to an alkaline soil (pH = 8.0), indicating the absence of positively charged 
sites in SW–CH at high pH values (Celis et al. 2012). 
14.4.3 DEGRADATIVE CAPACITY OF CONTAMINATED SOILS 
Bioaugmentation improves the degradative capacity of contaminated soils by in￾serting the specific community of microorganisms to the soils. Bioaugmentation can 
be achieved through immobilizing microorganisms in several carriers or the use of 
activated soil (Pal et al. 2021). Chitosan polymers either in the form of beads, 
flakes, membranes, or composites can be used for the immobilization of bacterial 
community that slowly releases the microbes to the soil (Mohan and Pittman 2007; 
Angelim et al. 2013). For efficient functioning of microorganisms Jobin et al. used 
the chitosan beads encapsulated the Streptomycetes spores against the common scab 
of potatoes (Jobin et al. 2005). 
14.4.4 CHITOSAN IN SENSOR TECHNOLOGY 
Chitosan has been recognized to play a prominent role in developing the electro￾chemical and optical sensors for in-situ identification of trace contaminants. Based 
on its enzyme compatibility and stability on nanoparticles, natural chitosan is used 
390 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications predominantly as an immobilizing agent in sensor technology. Chitosan gels are 
being used for the homogenous immobilization of contaminant sensing agents (e.g., 
enzymes, microbes and nanoparticles) by various processes such as coagulation 
(alginate, phosphate) and crosslinking (Sugunan et al. 2005; Radhakumary and 
Sreenivasan 2012). These immobilization processses maintain the adherence of 
sensing elements in the chitosan gel phase, which prevents instability and loss of the 
sensing agent (Yong et al. 2015). 
14.5 NANOCHITOSAN-DERIVED MATERIALS FOR AIR 
REMEDIATION 
Air pollutant particularly particulate matter (PM) is known to be causing serious 
health issues to human beings, reducing the atmospheric visibility, and affecting the 
production efficiency, ecosystems, and climate globally (Zhen Wang et al. 2018). 
With aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 µm, PM has a long-life span, can travel over 
thousands of kilometers, have high adsorption capacity for toxic pollutants, and 
high penetration toward respiratory systems (Shen et al. 2011; Turner et al. 2011). 
Recently, nanofibers are being used as an effective remedial strategy for the re￾moval of aerosols at micron level (Leung and Hung 2012). 
14.5.1 CHITOSAN-BASED ELECTROSPUN NANOFIBER FILTERS 
Electrospun nanofiber filters are being developed using different materials, ex￾hibiting controlled morphology and characteristic 3D structures (Jing et al. 2016; 
Zhe Wang et al. 2016; S. Zhang, Tang, et al. 2016). However, the low dissolution of 
chitosan in water makes its electrospinning difficult. Although several researchers 
examined the effect of solvents (acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, formic acid, and 
trifluoroacetic acid TFA) on the morphology of chitosan nanofibers. 
Electrospinning of chitosan nanofiber can be achieved using a blend of chitosan 
with another polymer, such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), poly(vinyl alcohol) 
(PVA), Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and silk fibroin (L. Wang et al. 2016). Zhang 
et al. described that the chitosan nanofibers prepared from direct e-spinning are 
more time efficient in removing the PM2.5, because of high polarity of positively 
charged NH3+ group and smaller diameter (Leung and Hung 2012). Wang et al. 
developed an ultra-fine chitosan hybrid nanofiber comprising TiO2 and/or Ag na￾noparticles by needleless electrospinning method. The hybrid nanofibers achieved ≥ 
99% filtration efficiency for the removal of nano-aerosols (Turner et al. 2011). 
However, there are some drawbacks associated with the electrospun fiber filters. 
For example, it is difficult to control the packing density and fiber diameter of 
electrospun fibers (Podgórski, Bałazy, and Gradoń 2006). Mostly, they are not 
uniform and self-supported, which causes easy disintegration of their cavity 
structure (S. Zhang, Liu, et al. 2016). Furthermore, the electrospinning is not an 
environmentally friendly process, as significant hazardous vapors emit to the en￾vironment. Additionally, the output products are expensive due to slow production 
rate that makes them difficult to achieve the industrial-scale requirements 
(Podgórski, Bałazy, and Gradoń 2006; Barhate and Ramakrishna 2007). 
Trends in Nanochitosan-Based Materials 391 14.5.2 CHITOSAN-BASED HOLLOW FIBER MEMBRANES 
Besides other filtration applications, hollow fiber membranes can also be used for 
nanofiltration (NF) (Gao et al. 2017), organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) (Sun 
et al. 2015; Tham et al. 2017), membrane distillation (MD), and gas separation (Lu, 
Zuo, and Chung 2017). The hollow fibers have several advantages such as large 
membrane area per unit module volume, self-supported structure, and easy handling 
for industrial scale up (Liang, Yong, and Chung 2017). However, there are some 
challenges in designing a hollow fiber with high selectivity and permeability. As the 
filtration performance of the membranes can be improved by using the inorganic 
materials such as titanium dioxide (TiO2) (Y. Yang et al. 2007), aluminum oxide 
(Al2O3) (Vanangamudi, Hamzah, and Singh 2015), and silica (SiO2) (Pourafshari 
Chenar et al. 2013), these materials have been integrated into membranes. Among 
them, SiO2 has more advantages and commonly used because it is chemically 
stable, less expensive, and compatible with organic solvents used to prepare 
polymer dopes (Bottino et al. 2001; Yu et al. 2015). 
Wang et al. prepared the nanochitosan (CS)/polyvinyl alcohol membrane for air 
filtration through nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS) method. The mem￾brane M30-3 with the thickness of 37 µm presented the highest air filtration quality 
with the 95.59% filtration efficiency (C. T. Liu et al. 2018). The poly(lactic acid) 
(PLA, [CH(CH3)COO]n) is a linear aliphatic polyester, can be prepared through 
fermentation and polymerization from renewable bioresources. The PLA can be 
transformed to nano fibrous membranes through dissolution in common solvents 
and electrospinning and possesses the good mechanical properties. As air filtration 
media, Li et al. prepared the nano-porous fibrous membranes through electrospin￾ning of PLA solution with homogenous dispersion of chitosan nanoparticles, 
maintaining the solution viscosity. Li et al. reported that high filtration efficiency of 
98.99% was achieved by using the PLA/chitosan membrane (with a mass ratio of 
chitosan/PLA of 2:5:8) with the high antibacterial activity of 99.4% and 99.5% 
against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively (H. Li et al. 2018). 
14.5.3 CHITOSAN-BASED NANOTUBES FOR AIR FILTRATION 
Wang et al. developed an eco-friendly halloysite nanotubes chitosan/polyvinyl al￾cohol/nonwoven fabric (HNTCS/PVA/NWF) hybrid membrane with porous 
structure (distributed uniformly) for air filtration. Wang et al. reported that 96.8% 
filtration efficiency was achieved and concluded that this filtration performance is 
due to the membrane surface with the strong interactions and diffusion adsorption 
caused by the CS/PVA matrix and HNTs, respectively (Zhen Wang et al. 2020). 
14.6 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVE 
Chitosan and its derivatives are widely used because of their versatility, biodegrad￾ability, abundance nature, and ease of modification. Chitosan-based nanomaterials 
(nanoparticles, nanofiber, beads, magnetic-chitosan nanocomposite) become more 
popular due to their unique characteristics such as eco-friendliness, cost-effectiveness, 
392 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications high crystallinity, larger surface area, and significant chemical reactivity. Ionotropic 
gelation and co-precipitation are widely used methods for the preparation of nanochi￾tosan. Chitosan-based nanomaterials and nanocomposites have been used for removing 
pollutants such as heavy metals, organics dyes, oil, etc. from wastewater, industrial 
wastewater. The chitosan-based nanomaterials (beads, gels, magnetic-chitosan nano￾composite) have been used for the soil remediation contaminated with lead, copper, and 
cadmium. Chitosan-based nanomaterials also have a significant role in sensor tech￾nology for the in-situ identification of trace contaminants. Recently the chitosan-based 
products (nano-fibers filters, hollow fiber membranes, nanotubes) have been used in 
remedial technologies for removing the aerosol particles. Finally, this chapter concludes 
that chitosan-based nanomaterials have a bright future in water purification, soil, and air 
remediation. The next step is the commercialization of nanochitosan as renewable, 
sustainable, and cost-effective materials for environmental remediation. 
A plethora of research has been conducted on the utilization of nanochitosan for 
environmental remediation. However, there are many research questions need to be 
addressed for its applications at larger scale. Most importantly, detailed studies of 
mechanistic understanding of nanochitosan-based materials and their interactions 
with pollutants should be the priority for researchers which will provide foundation 
for its industrial applications. In the coming years, demand for nanochitosan-based 
materials for environmental applications will grow tremendously due to their en￾vironment friendly nature.

15.1 INTRODUCTION 
The greatest challenge that humans will face in the near future is the scarcity of 
potable water due to unsustainable practices. As we know 71% of the earth’s surface 
is covered by water, but freshwater amounts to only 2.5% of it. The population ex￾plosion inevitably demands rapid urbanization and industrialization to meet the basic 
necessity of people all over the world. This in turn leads to overexploitation of natural 
resources, especially water, to a much greater extent. According to UNICEF, today 
about 33% of the world’s population experiences severe water scarcity for at least a 
month a year. And if this trend continues, by 2025, water scarcity will affect half of 
the world’s population (“Water Scarcity | UNICEF” n.d.). This view gives us an 
insight into the greatest challenges we are going to face. In such a scenario, over￾exploitation and contamination of water resources should be avoided in favour of 
future generations. In addition to that, the implications of contaminated water on 
human health based on the various diseases are in the order of billions of dollars. Just 
to cite an example, the yearly load on the Indian government because of diarrhoea 
contamination is around USD 8.0 billion. However, we cannot completely avoid such 
practices unless a future technology that remedies all such problems is invented. Here 
comes the importance of inventing new methods for decontaminating water to meet 
the increasing needs of people, especially in developing countries. 
According to the United Nations, the main reason for water scarcity today is the lack of 
adequate wastewater treatment, with around 80% of the total wastewater produced not 
404 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications being properly treated. Untreated water from any source, especially from industries, 
contains many hazardous chemical compounds that endanger all living things. Most of 
the major pollutants responsible for the degradation of water sources are heavy metal 
ions, dyes, oils, salts, microbes, etc. Pollutant removal can be achieved through several 
known mechanisms such as membrane separation, ion exchange, photocatalysis, ad￾sorption and electrochemical treatment. Even though the methods currently used for 
water purification are adequate up to some extent, their versatility cannot be guaranteed 
considering cost and secondary pollution. Being the most common and abundantly 
available material, cellulose, the raw material used for producing NC has recently drawn 
the attention of scientists and engineers for its wide range of applicability in the fields of 
medicine, engineering, and so on. Major drawbacks of NC are membrane fouling and 
solvent waste from processing NC. The porous and hydrophilic nature of NC, along with 
tunable surface characteristics, high mechanical strength, and high surface area have 
found application in the field of water treatment. 
15.2 WATER POLLUTION 
Water is considered polluted if it is contaminated with anything that prevents its use 
for a specific purpose. Water resources are generally polluted in various ways and 
extents depending upon the location of water resources and sources of pollution 
present. Most of the pollution happens near industrialized and urban areas compared 
to rural areas. Also, the types of contaminants, like dye, metal ions, oil, drugs, etc., 
may vary depending on the sources, like industries, hospitals, municipalities, etc., 
from which water resources are contaminated. In rural areas, organic wastes 
dominate, whereas in urban and industrial areas, along with organic materials, in￾organic and nonbiodegradable wastes such as plastics, hazardous chemicals and 
microbes are also present. The size of the pollutants is a major concern as most 
of the macro-sized pollutants can be easily filtered using membranes, but micro and 
nanosized pollutants and microbes make current filtration techniques compromising 
in terms of removal efficiency. For the development of more effective systems 
for purification, one needs to know the types of pollutants and their extent based 
on location. We can classify pollutant sources into two categories: 
1. Direct sources of pollution 
2. Indirect sources of pollution 
15.2.1 DIRECT SOURCES OF POLLUTION 
The main stream of pollutants comes from the direct dumping of wastes, especially 
domestic and industrial wastes, into water resources such as ponds, rivers, etc. This 
waste accounts for most of the pollution, while indirect sources are marginal. 
Domestic wastes mainly contain electronic wastes, human waste, hospital waste, 
waste from hotels and restaurants, organic waste, plastics, chemicals, pesticides, re￾sidential waste, etc. Industrial wastes mainly contain chemicals such as dyes, 
paints, oil, metal ions, salts, etc., arising from oil production, mining, chemical fac￾tories, manufacturing plants, petroleum refineries, textile mills, etc. Along with that, 
Nanocellulose Membrane for Water Treatment 405 microorganisms are also present in considerable amounts, causing the obnoxious 
smell of water. A polluted water source is highly impeding any flora and fauna. 
15.2.2 INDIRECT SOURCES OF POLLUTION 
Pollution can also come from soil and rain. If groundwater comes into contact with 
already deeply polluted soil, the fresh groundwater will be polluted. Another concern is 
rain; when it rains in areas with high air pollution, contaminants come down with the rain 
and it, in turn, pollutes freshwater sources. Even though these types of pollutants are 
unavoidable, they do not affect any living organisms as compared to direct pollution. 
15.3 MAJOR CONTAMINANTS AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS 
The presence of hydrogen atoms (positively charged) and oxygen atoms (negatively 
charged) makes water a universal solvent. This property of water causes it to attract 
any pollutant and dissolve it easily; this will contaminate water. The type of pol￾lutants can be either naturally occurring or manmade (Gopakumar et al. 2019). The 
main sources of contaminants are agricultural wastes, industrial wastes, household 
wastes, dyes, pesticides, sewage wastes, animal wastes, and hospital wastes. Based 
on their characteristics, pollutants can be classified mainly into three categories: 
physical contaminants, chemical contaminants, and biological contaminants. 
15.3.1 PHYSICAL CONTAMINANTS 
These tend to alter the visual appearance and properties of water. Contaminants like 
solid materials such as sediments, organic, inorganic, etc. materials are suspended 
in water, and hence, can be seen physically (Uddin, Nash, and Olbert 2021). If only 
physical contaminants are present, they can be easily filtered out using a regular 
filter by size exclusion. Physical contamination is assessed by measuring tem￾perature (palatability, viscosity, solubility, odours, and chemical reactions are in￾fluenced by temperature) (Omer 2020) colour, turbidity and suspended solids. 
15.3.2 CHEMICAL CONTAMINANTS 
These tend to alter the chemical structure of water. They can either be naturally 
present in soil or man-made chemicals that are released directly into water bodies or 
reach water by leaching through the soil. Generally heavy metals ions, chemicals 
waste from industries, pesticides, dyes, etc. are the main pollutants. Even though 
colour change, odour, or taste may occur in water due to the admission of some 
chemical contaminants, it may not be easily detected by a physical examination in 
all cases. Laboratory testing is required to identify the chemicals present in water. 
Size exclusion alone cannot easily remove chemical contaminants. Special methods 
are needed to adsorb or remove the contaminants; they include distillation, elec￾trostatic interaction, reverse osmosis, hydrophobic/hydrophilic interaction, etc. The 
extent of chemical contamination is estimated by analyzing pH, dissolved oxygen 
406 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), 
alkalinity, Cl- and specific conductivity. 
15.3.3 BIOLOGICAL CONTAMINANTS 
These refer to microbes like fungus, bacteria, viruses, etc., which make water not 
safe for household uses. The indication of biological contamination can be identi￾fied by the foul smell of water. The microbial attributes such as coliform-faecal and 
coliform-total are considered for assessing the quality of water. 
Along with the above-mentioned parameters, other parameters are also con￾sidered, like total phosphate, total sulphate, nitrates, total hardness, and total ni￾trogen. Toxics, pesticides, phenols, and detergents are the other chemicals of 
concern along with heavy metals like Cd, Mn, Zn, Cu and Hg. 
Water quality is assessed by a tool, the water quality index (WQI), based on the 
amount and type of contaminants mentioned above (Figure 15.1). The factors to be 
used for assessment are determined based on the location of water source, the po￾tential of contamination, and its intended usage. Three factors are used for calculating 
WQI, namely physical, chemical, and biological parameters (Uddin, Nash, and Olbert 
2021). WQI indicates the quality of water on a scale of 0–100 (Tyagi et al. 2020). 
Lower values point to lesser amounts of dissolved pollutants and higher values in￾dicate higher contamination. Excellent quality water has a WQI value in the range of 
0–25, a scale of 26–50 indicating good quality, 51–75 denoting poor quality, 76–100 
indicating very poor quality (not safe), and above 100 representing undrinkable water. 
15.4 LIGNOCELLULOSIC BIOMASS 
Agricultural wastes such as plant residues, wood, forestry waste residues, and grass 
are the main source of lignocellulosic biomass. Besides cellulose, two other ele￾ments are present in lignocellulosic biomass, namely hemicelluloses and lignin. The 
amounts of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin vary with the source and type of 
lignocellulosic biomass, especially for hardwood and softwood (Phanthong et al. 
2018). Lignocellulose is processed to extract cellulose and discard lignin and 
hemicellulose using chemical treatments. 
FIGURE 15.1 WQI parameters. 
Nanocellulose Membrane for Water Treatment 407 15.4.1 CELLULOSE 
Cellulose is the major constituent of the lignocellulosic biomass, which amounts 
to around 35%–50% by weight (Phanthong et al. 2018). Cellulose is a polymer 
composed of glucose units (C6H10O5)n, which is formed by covalent bonding 
through acetal functions between the equatorial hydroxyl groups of C4 and the 
C1 carbon atoms. This results in a linear polysaccharide structure. Cellulose 
provides the plant cell wall with high mechanical strength and insolubility in most 
organic solvents. 
15.4.2 HEMICELLULOSE 
Hemicelluloses amount to 20% to 30% of the total lignocellulosic biomass. 
The function of hemicelluloses is to give strength to plant cell walls through 
adhesion to cellulose by hydrogen bonds. They are mainly composed of pentoses 
and hexoses monomers (Anwar, Gulfraz, and Irshad 2014). There are two 
types of hemicelluloses found in wood, based on whether it is softwood or 
hardwood; they are xylans, present in hardwood, and glucomannans, present in 
softwood. 
15.4.3 LIGNIN 
Dry lignocellulosic biomass contains 10%–25% by weight of lignin, a binder ma￾terial that holds cellulose and hemicelluloses together. The presence of lignin 
contributes to the strength of the plant cell walls, which is termed compressive 
strength and stiffness. Lignin also prevents any water permeation into cell walls, 
hence preventing decay of the plant cells. 
15.5 NANOCELLULOSE (NC): INTRODUCTION/FUNDAMENTALS 
AND EXTRACTION 
Cellulose is a natural polymer found in plant cell walls. NC can be extracted 
using various chemical and mechanical top-down treatments in the form of na￾nosized material. Since plants are everywhere, NC availability is highly guar￾anteed. The plant cell walls not only contain cellulose, but also lignin and 
hemicellulose in a considerable amount. The various treatments for the removal 
of hemicellulose and lignin result in two different forms of NC, namely cellulose 
nanofibrils (CNF), and cellulose nanocrystals (CNC). Bacterial NC (BNC) is 
another form of NC obtained in a pure state from a bottom-up approach. For 
water filtration, these three candidates are well suited in terms of purification 
efficacy and water flux. The mechanisms involved in water purification are ad￾sorption, electrostatic interaction, and size exclusion, which can be drastically 
improved by varying the adsorption sites, electrostatic potential, and pore size, 
respectively. However, the characteristics of the extracted NC differ depending 
on the source of extraction. 
408 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 15.5.1 EXTRACTION 
Among cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin, cellulose possesses most of the de￾sired properties as a membrane material; hence, its extraction from lignocellulosic 
biomass effectively and efficiently is highly needed. There are two stages for the 
extraction, pretreatment, acid, and alkali treatments. Following chemical pre￾treatments for the removal of hemicelluloses and lignin from the biomass, acid￾based or enzymatic hydrolysis is performed to extract NC from cellulose. Besides 
chemical treatment, mechanical grinding can also be used to break down the macro￾sized cellulose into NC fibrils. 
15.5.2 PRETREATMENT 
Pretreatment is used to remove lignin and hemicelluloses and to obtain nearly pure 
cellulose from lignocellulosic biomass. Initially, the biomass is pretreated with an 
acid. During this process, lignin is almost completely removed; hence, it is also 
known as the delignification process. It is performed by stirring lignocellulosic 
biomass with distilled water, sodium chlorite, and acetic acid at 70°C–80°C for 
4–12 hours. To control the pH, acetic acid and sodium chlorite are added to the 
mixture at regular one-hour intervals overnight. Then, the mixture is washed with 
distilled water to bring its pH to neutral. The collected solid materials are then oven￾dried at 50°C to obtain holocellulose, which is a mixture of hemicelluloses and 
cellulose in the fibre. The absence of lignin and other impurities can be identified 
from the white hue of the holocellulose fibre. 
Alkaline treatment is used for the removal of hemicelluloses and any residual 
lignin. Sodium hydroxide at 4–20 wt% is used for the alkaline treatment, which is 
usually mixed with holocellulose for 1–5 hours. The solid products are then rinsed 
with distilled water until their pH becomes neutral and then oven-dried at 50°C. The 
majority of the fibrous products from this treatment consist of cellulose. The re￾sulting cellulose is composed of two regions, viz. amorphous and crystalline. The 
following treatments are designed either for the removal of amorphous regions or 
mechanical defibrillation resulting in CNC or CNF, respectively. The characteristics 
of CNC and CNF are given in Table 15.1.

Visual appearance Transparent or iridescent films Transparent films 
Nanocellulose Membrane for Water Treatment 409 15.5.3 ACID-BASED HYDROLYSIS 
For acid hydrolysis, a strong acid, hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, is used. A 
strong acid could remove most of the amorphous regions of cellulose and result 
in the release of crystalline nanocellulose (CNC) in the form of rod-like 
nanoparticles. 
15.5.4 ENZYMATIC HYDROLYSIS 
In this process, the cellulose fibre is altered using enzymes, a biological treatment 
method, during which the enzymes help in the cleavage of cellulose fibres to break 
down into NC. 
15.5.5 MECHANICAL FIBRILLATION 
To break down large cellulose fibres, consisting of fibril aggregates, into more or 
less individualized fibrils, a shear force can be applied along the longitudinal axis of 
the cellulose fibrils employing any method such as high-pressure homogenization, 
ultrasonication, and ball milling. The major disadvantage of mechanical processes 
is their considerable energy consumption. As a result, the mechanical shearing 
process is frequently coupled with other effective pretreatment methods to reduce 
energy consumption. 
15.6 NC MEMBRANES 
NC is an advanced material with the following qualities: abundant availability, 
nontoxicity by nature and biodegradability (Y. Liu and Liu 2021). Nanosized CNC 
or CNF can be used to prepare membranes with extremely low pore sizes for the 
effective removal of both micro- and nanosized pollutants. Since the surface of NC 
is rich in hydroxyl groups, it can be tuned to be used for any particular filtration 
application. 
Due to its high crystallinity and mechanical strength, NC can be used either as a 
reinforcing material for traditional membranes to increase their strength and fil￾tration efficiency or as a stand-alone membrane material (Y. Liu and Liu 2021). The 
main advantages of NC are its abundance and low cost, which makes it a highly 
suitable membrane material, along with other favourable properties such as flex￾ibility, light weight, high mechanical strength, reusability, and recyclability. 
However, pristine cellulose is prone to fouling due to weak chemical resistance and 
its life span is affected by the contamination level of water. 
There are currently five types of filtration techniques in use (Y. Liu and Liu 
2021). Based on the extension of filtration ability, they have named microfiltration 
(MF, 10–0.1 µm), ultrafiltration (UF, 0.1–0.01 µm), nanofiltration (NF, 0.01–0.001 
µm), reverse osmosis (RO, <0.001 µm), and forward osmosis (FO). In contrast to 
forward osmosis, which uses the penetration pressure differences on both sides of 
the solution as its driving power, reverse osmosis relies on the solvent to overcome 
the pressure difference caused by an external force. 
410 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 15.7 PREPARATION OF NC MEMBRANE 
Membrane preparation is the most important step in water purification as it can 
affect the performance of the membrane. The balance between porosity, perme￾ability, and absorptivity have to be properly achieved for efficient purification 
(Georgouvelas et al. 2021). There are mainly seven membrane preparation methods: 
phase inversion, interfacial polymerization, track-etching, vacuum filtration, solvent 
casting, dip coating, and electro spinning. 
15.8 CHARACTERISTICS OF NC MEMBRANE 
As a promising candidate, NC meets all the good characteristics expected for a 
membrane material. The favourable characteristics are explained below. 
15.8.1 HYDROPHILICITY 
NC is highly hydrophilic due to the presence of hydroxyl groups on the membrane 
surface, which is helpful in the selective removal of certain hydrophobic con￾taminants. The surface characteristics can be tailored by proper surface modification 
for imparting hydrophobic nature to the cellulose surface; hence, contaminants can 
be selectively adsorbed to the membrane surface very easily. 
15.8.2 POROSITY 
Porosity is the desired property in water filtration. Removal of contaminants by size 
exclusion can be done by varying the porosity of the membrane. The pore size can 
greatly influence water flux; a larger pore size facilitates a higher permeability of 
water, and a lower pore size reduces the water flux considerably. The porosity is 
determined by the NC fibre diameter and thickness of the membrane. A larger fibre 
diameter always results in larger pore sizes and good mechanical strength, but a 
lower number of adsorption sites available compared to smaller fibre diameters. 
15.8.3 HIGH SURFACE AREA 
Large surface area is highly favourable for adsorption of pollutants. With a greater 
surface area, more adsorption sites are available on the NC membrane for attracting 
and containing the pollutants. Also, the high specific volume facilitates it to permit 
more water flux and a higher rate of filtration. 
15.8.4 MODIFIABLE SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS 
The surface characteristic of NC can be tuned for selective removal of various 
contaminants that possess different characteristics. The hydroxyl groups available at 
the surface of the NC membrane can be modified by suitable chemistry to form a 
composite structure to impart specific properties that are not exhibited by pristine 
cellulose. 
Nanocellulose Membrane for Water Treatment 411 15.8.5 ELECTROSTATIC INTERACTION 
The usual extraction process of CNC involves a sulfuric acid hydrolysis step. It 
results in the grafting of anionic sulfate groups at the surface of CNC, which can 
induce the adsorption of cationic species. These negative charges can be used to 
electrostatically attract and remove cationic metal ions. Major metal ions that cause 
pollution are Cu(II), Al(II), Cd(II), Pb(II), etc., which can be removed by electro￾static attraction. 
15.8.6 WATER FLUX 
The amount of water that can be filtered by a membrane is affected by its capability 
to permeate water through it. The highly porous structure of NC membranes allows 
for a high water flux. This flux also varies with the concentration and size of 
contaminants and time of usage. Water pressure is another decisive factor, high 
pressure water results in higher water flux. There is always a tradeoff between water 
flux and filtration efficiency. 
15.8.7 MECHANICAL STRENGTH 
NC membranes show high tensile strength, which is a highly desirable property in 
high-pressure water filtration for higher water flux. They also have good compression 
resilience; hence, they retain their structure even after multiple filtration cycles. 
15.8.8 REUSABILITY AND BIODEGRADABILITY 
Membranes can be reused up to a certain extent without any decrease in filtration 
efficacy. Since NC is biodegradable by nature, it can be easily disposed of without 
causing any secondary pollution. 
15.9 WATER FILTRATION MECHANISMS USING NC 
Different mechanisms are used for the removal of contaminants with various 
chemical and physical properties. Selection of mechanism and preparation of NC 
needs to be initially determined by the nature of the pollutant, the extent of pol￾lution, and amount of water to be treated. Most major pollutants can be effectively 
treated with the following mechanisms. 
a. Filtration by size exclusion. 
b. Filtration by electrostatic interaction. 
c. Filtration by hydrophilicity. 
15.9.1 FILTRATION BY SIZE EXCLUSION 
Membrane performance is an essential parameter to control to effectively reject 
pollutants. Smaller pore size always results in a higher pollutants rejection rate, but 
412 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications the water flux is also affected (Sharma et al. 2020). The main factor that controls the 
porosity of the membrane is the diameter of the NC fibrils that are used for 
membrane preparation. It is observed that fibrils with a diameter of 3–6 nm can be 
used to prepare a thin membrane with a mean pore size of approximately 20 nm. 
With the increase in fibril diameter, the pore size and water flux are substantially 
increased, but this, in turn, affects the selective rejection of pollutants. To achieve 
efficient filtration, the membrane has to be made with fibrils of appropriate dia￾meter. Another major factor concerning water flux is the thickness of the membrane 
(Sharma et al. 2020). A thick membrane could be favourable for applying higher 
pressure because of its good mechanical properties, such as tensile strength and 
Young’s modulus, but it will adversely affect the water flux due to the decrease in 
the pore size of the membrane. 
15.9.2 FILTRATION BY ELECTROSTATIC INTERACTION 
Contaminants such as dyes and metal ions are toxic by nature. Prolonged exposure 
to dyes causes severe health issues related to pulmonary organs, skin allergies, and 
even cancer. Dyes can be cationic, anionic, and nonionic. NC exhibits a high af￾finity toward charged pollutants, especially due to the presence of hydroxyl groups 
present on their surface. Hydroxyl groups can easily interact with charged particles. 
Proper functionalization of the NC membrane surface with a suitable additive must 
be performed to attract a variety of charged pollutants through electrostatic inter￾action much more efficiently than the pure form of NC (Georgouvelas et al. 2021). 
The abundance of hydroxyl groups helps to properly functionalize the surface to 
impart the desired properties to the membrane surface. This helps in the removal of 
dyes (cationic or anionic) and metal ions. Cationic dyes can be removed with NCs 
functionalized with anionic functional groups and anionic dyes with cationic 
functionalization (Reshmy et al. 2021). 
15.9.3 FILTRATION BY THE HYDROPHILICITY 
NC is hydrophilic by nature due to the presence of a large number of hydroxyl (OH) 
groups on the molecular backbone (J. Huang et al. 2019). This facilitates the ab￾sorption of water by the membrane material and results in swelling. This hydro￾philic behaviour helps separate immiscible fluids, like water from oil contaminants. 
Once the membrane is wetted by water, no oil can come in contact with the 
membrane material, hence it only allows water to pass through. 
15.10 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN WATER FILTRATION 
USING NC-BASED MEMBRANES 
NC in different forms, such as membrane, aerogel, and composite forms, are used 
for the removal of highly toxic and nonbiodegradable pollutants that are micro and 
nano in size. Especially, heavy metal ions, dyes, and microbes are the main can￾didates as they can produce adverse effects on all living organisms through direct 
Nanocellulose Membrane for Water Treatment 413 ingestion and accumulation. The main focus is on the removal of major con￾taminants, such as heavy metal ions, dyes, microbes and oil/water separation. 
15.10.1 REMOVAL OF HEAVY METAL IONS 
Heavy metals ions are considered a great threat due to their adverse effects on 
public health, as well as all kinds of living organisms, including plants and fresh￾water supply (Fato et al. 2019). The major heavy metal ions that contaminate water 
are Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+ Cr3+, As3+ and Ni2+. These kinds of non￾biodegradable metal ions can cause severe health issues, such as permanent kidney 
damage, the nervous system breaking down, and poor renal function. So, their 
effective removal has been a priority in recent decades. 
The conventional water-purification methods used for the removal of heavy 
metal ions are chemical precipitation, flocculation, ion exchange, evaporation, and 
electrolysis. The high cost, high energy consumption, time consumption, and sec￾ondary pollution of these methods led to the search for economical and efficient 
means to remove heavy metal ions even from dilute solutions (Hokkanen, Repo, 
and Sillanpää 2013). A recent development in the field of heavy metal ion removal 
is membrane technology. It has the advantage of renewability and is a pollution-free 
process when compared to conventional processes (Y. Liu and Liu 2021). Recent 
studies focused on using membrane materials like PVA, polysulfone, etc. However, 
membrane fouling and secondary pollution are the limitations of using such ma￾terials in commercial applications. This led to the exploration of NC as a membrane 
material because of its biodegradability, abundant availability, and sustainability. 
Also, the rich hydroxyl groups available on NC make it tunable for selective ad￾sorption of pollutants. 
Recent studies in employing NC as a standalone or as a composite membrane 
material are explained in detail in the coming section. This section discusses NC in 
the form of aerogels, beads, and membranes in metal ion removal from water. 
i. Wood-inspired NC aerogel (TCTGAs) 
ii. Pectin/cellulose microfiber composite beads (Pec/CNF) 
iii. Dual nano fibrillar-based bio-sorbent films 
iv. Chitosan-NC based composite membrane (CS/NC) 
v. NC and polycaprolactone nanospun composite membranes 
The primary mechanism of metal ion removal is direct adsorption. The positively 
charged metal ions can be easily adsorbed onto the membrane if the surface of the 
membrane is maintained negatively charged. The presence of hydroxyl groups on 
the NC and the addition of amino groups onto the NC surface facilitates the binding 
of metal ions onto the membrane surface through electrostatic attraction and che￾lation reaction respectively. Adsorption is also affected by the pH of water to be 
treated. A higher pH value results in more hydroxyl ions in water, which react with 
metal ions hence forming precipitates. At lower pH values, due to the predominant 
interaction of hydrogen ions with the hydroxyl groups (protonation) on the NC 
membrane surface, the metal ion adsorption is reduced (Mo et al. 2019). 
414 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications The adsorption performance of the NC membrane is directly affected by the 
membrane’s surface area, porosity, pore accessibility, and diffusion rate of metal 
ions. A membrane with sufficient porosity is the primary necessity in enhancing 
the adsorption performance. This can be achieved by the use of aerogels. 
Aerogels are highly porous, lightweight 3D structures having density very close 
to air. Due to their high porosity (~99%), aerogels can facilitate easier water 
transport without the need for high pressures. Mo et.al. developed a highly elastic, 
highly porous (99.5%), 3D honeycomb structured aerogel (TCTGAs) using 
tempo-oxidised CNF (TCNF) and graphene oxide (GO) and trimethylolpropane￾tris-(2-methyl-1-aziridine) propionate (TMPTAP) as a crosslinking agent (Mo 
et al. 2021). TCTGAs could adsorb 571 and 462 mg/g of Pb(II) and Cu(II) ions, 
respectively, very rapidly. For other metal ions, the adsorption rates are given in 
Table 15.2. The rapid adsorption is attributed to the improved pore accessibility 
due to the formation of lengthy channels in the honeycomb structure resulting 
from unidirectional freeze-drying. 
Along with better surface or pore accessibility, the availability of functional 
groups on the membrane surface is necessary for the adsorption of metal ions. 
When positively charged metal ions come in contact with the membrane surface, the 
negatively charged hydroxyl groups present on NC can electrostatically attract it. In 
addition to that, the functionalization of the membrane can add specific functional 
groups, such as carboxyl groups, onto the membrane surface. For example, Lessa 
et al. (Lessa et al. 2020) added pectin (Pec) onto beads prepared by cellulose fibrils 
(CF), thereby carboxyl groups are embedded in the composite beads (Jakóbik￾Kolon et al. 2017). It could remove 58%, 77%, and 94% of Cd(II), Cu(II), and Fe 
(II) ions, respectively from water through electrostatic attraction. It was also ob￾served that the presence of multiple metal ions reduced the overall adsorption 
performance. Fe(II) ions are adsorbed in great amounts because of their reduced 
ionic radius and lower atomic weight compared to Cu(II) and Cd(II) (Laus and de 
Fávere 2011). The dual nano fibrillar-based bio-sorbent films prepared using CNF 
and LNFs (lysozyme nanofibrils) (Figure 15.2b) by Silva et al. (Silva et al. 2020) 
could adsorb 93.3% of mercury from water through chemisorption. The negatively 
charged carboxylic groups (−COO–) present at the surface of CNFs enhanced the 
removal of mercury (Thomas et al. 2018). 
In addition to electrostatic attraction, the addition of amino groups onto the 
membrane surface can further improve the adsorption rate. Through chelation reac￾tion, metal ions can be bound to amino groups and form chelates (Flora and Pachauri 
2010). Thereby, metal ions can be easily adsorbed from water sources. The TCTGAs 
prepared by Mo et al. showed a chelation reaction (Mo et al. 2021) due to the presence 
of the amino groups, resulting in rapid adsorption of Pb(II) in 2 minutes and 100% in 
10 minutes. This is attributed to the affinity of Pb(II) and Cu(II) toward the membrane 
through mono-layer chemisorption (Mo et al. 2021). The time taken for TCTGAs is 
much lower than any works reported before (Pu et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2019; Deng, 
Zhang, and Wang 2019; Wang et al. 2019). (Figure 15.2c). 
The use of abundantly available natural materials or their composites is of 
great importance due to their renewability and biodegradability. (Figure 15.2c). 
One such combination is NC and chitosan. Chitosan is a biocompatible and

416 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications biodegradable polymer. It is the deacetylated form of chitin, which is found 
abundantly in the shell of crustaceans such as crabs, prawns, shrimps, and krill. 
Chitosan naturally exhibits cationic characteristics, solubility, and adsorptive 
properties, they are highly favourable for selective adsorption of metal ions. The 
modification of chitosan is very convenient because of the presence of two re￾active functional groups (NH2 and OH) (Gu et al. 2021). There are three methods 
available for the modification of chitosan to improve its characteristics, chemical, 
mechanical, and enzymatic. Chemical modification can be done to introduce 
functional groups such as alkyl, carboxymethyl, and phenolic compounds. Due to 
the risk of toxic effects of chemical treatment, the enzymatic approach is gen￾erally preferred because enzymes act as catalysts and are highly specific. 
Chitosan-based adsorbents have proven to be good adsorbents of heavy metals, 
such as As, Cu, Cd, and Pb. The use of cross-linking agents, such as glutar￾aldehyde, formaldehyde, ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, isocyanates, and var￾ious alteration methods, can enhance the physical, chemical, and biological 
properties of chitosan (Begum et al. 2021). This composition was found to be 
very effective in removing chromium ions from water. This composite membrane 
shows a good hydrophilic nature and the presence of hydroxyl linkage provides 
additional advantages of high water retention capacity and mechanical strength. 
FIGURE 15.2 Preparation of (a) wood-inspired NC ( Mo et al. 2021) (b) dual nano fibrillar￾based bio-sorbent films ( Silva et al. 2020) and (c) chitosan-NC composite membrane 
( Goswami et al. 2021). 
Nanocellulose Membrane for Water Treatment 417 Even though functional groups can remove metal substantially, size exclusion 
is the best mechanism that can completely remove metal ions by permitting only 
water molecules to pass through the membrane pores. Through the pore size 
adjustment, a pollutant with a relatively larger size than the pore size can be 
easily separated from water. The polycaprolactone (PCL) (biodegradable polye￾ster), cellulose nanofiber (CNF) composite membrane (PCL/CNF) prepared by 
Hinestroza et al. (Hinestroza et al. 2020) through the electrospinning method, 
used the size exclusion technique to remove iron and chromium ions from tap 
water. The PCL/CNF composite could remove 75% to 99% of iron and chromium 
from tap water. The colloidal form of metal ions facilitated easy removal of it 
through size exclusion. 
The acidity or alkalinity of water can seriously affect the performance of the 
NC membrane. The Pec/CF composite beads prepared by Lessa et al. (Lessa et al. 
2020) showed maximum adsorption in the pH of 3.5 and 5 for Cd(II) and Cu(II) 
respectively. Above pH values 3.5 the ionization of pec carboxyl groups (-COO−
) 
facilitates the ionic crosslinking of pec with divalent cations. This is because of 
the electrostatic interaction between divalent ions (metal ions) in water and 
carboxyl groups on pectin. However, these pH values are very difficult to 
maintain in the large-scale processing of water. However, for LNF/CNF com￾posite prepared by Silva et al. (Silva et al. 2020) showed a maximum adsorption 
performance of 99% at pH 11. This was attributed to a minimum surface zeta 
potential of 3.0 ± 0.2 mV at pH 11. To check the stability of the PCL/CNF 
composite membrane in harsh environments, it was dipped in acid (HCl) and 
alkali (NaOH) for 24 hours. The membrane completely dissolved into HCl, 
whereas, in an alkaline medium, it showed less solubility. Hence, the applicability 
of the PCL/CNF membrane is subject to the pH of water to be treated. 
The type of NC, fibre diameter, and type of crosslinking greatly influence 
the mechanical strength of the membrane. The honeycomb structure of TCTGAs 
and the covalent bonding between TCNF and GO improved the mechanical 
strength of the aerogel (4.2 kPa at 40% strain) (Hyun and Torquato 2000) (Qiu 
et al. 2012). 
Moreover, along with good adsorption performance, recyclability is also an 
important aspect needed in membrane materials to avoid secondary pollution. 
TCTGAs showed excellent regeneration and adsorption capacity, even after five 
adsorption/desorption cycles, since no apparent collapse occurred in the structure 
after multiple adsorption/desorption processes (Mo et al. 2021). For Pec/CF, the 
reusability of the composite was also not significantly affected up to five reuses, and 
from the first to the last stage, an overall reduction in efficiency of 10% was ob￾served. For assessing the reusability of PCL/CNF (Hinestroza et al. 2020), water 
with 100 ppm of chromium was filtered through the membrane for 10 cycles. After 
each cycle, the amount of chromium remaining in water was measured. It was 
observed that the first four cycles play a major role in removing chromium ions 
from 87 ppm to 29 ppm, after which no major decrease is observed. But, after 10 
cycles, clogging of pores of the membrane by the metal ion prevented subsequent 
adsorption. 
418 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 15.10.2 REMOVAL OF DYES 
Textile dyes diversely affect plant growth, cause the death of living organisms in 
water due to increased biochemical and chemical oxygen demand, and significantly 
reduce the aesthetic quality of water bodies. Dyes can also enter the food chain and 
produce serious health issues due to their mutagenic and carcinogenic character￾istics. They are mainly used in the textile industry in the production chain. They 
come in four forms: viz. reactive, direct, acidic and basic. None of the conventional 
decontamination methods is effective against dye removal as they are highly soluble 
in the aqueous medium (Lellis et al. 2019). 
This section focuses mainly on two types of commonly used dyes, methylene 
blue (MB) and rhodamine B (RhB). Mechanisms that are found to be effective in 
removing positively and negatively charged dyes are electrostatic interactions, 
hydrophobic interactions, and molecular size exclusion. These mechanisms, alone 
or in combination, can be applied to achieve the desired results (P. Liu, Zhu, and 
Mathew 2019). The properties of pristine NC can be enhanced by proper surface 
modification or by forming composites with biopolymers that exhibit the desired 
characteristics. NC-based membranes that have recently found applications in this 
field are listed below. 
• Graphene oxide/cellulose nanofiber (GO/CNF) membrane 
• Magnetic NC (MGCNF) membrane 
• Bacterial nanocellulose/molybdenum disulfide (BC/MoS2) membrane 
• CNC, TO-CNF and CNC-g-PCysMA membranes 
• TOCN/PVA/M-K10 aerogel (TPMA) 
• Carbon dot-cellulose (CD@CNF) membrane 
Membrane pore size has a significant role in excluding pollutants through size 
exclusion, as well as maintaining the water flux. The addition of a thin GO layer on 
the CNF membrane will improve the water permeability of the membrane due to the 
presence of standing inserted GO sheets as they form nano-channels through the 
membrane that facilitate easy water transport. Lie e. al. prepared GO/CNF mem￾branes using CNF and GO layers with various thicknesses (ranging from 0.9 to 
1.1 nm) was coated on the membrane surface (P. Liu, Zhu, and Mathew 2019). The 
pore size of the membrane was found to be decreased with an increase in GO layer 
thickness due to denser and smaller pores of GO compared to CNF. The CNF 
membrane exhibited rather good water permeability (3229 L/m2
∙ h∙ bar) due to the 
large micron-sized pores in the network. Even though the addition of GO reduces 
the overall pore size of the membrane, water permeability was found to be increased 
to 18,123 L/m2
∙ h∙ bar due to the presence of standing inserted GO sheets that 
facilitated water transport. However, as the GO membrane thickness was increased, 
the denser layer of GO reduced the permeability to 723 L/m2
.h.bar. The dye￾rejection rate was 98.8% for VBB, 97.6% for MV@ and 92.3% for R6G for GO￾CNF1 membrane with the GO grammage of 0.2 g/m2
. It was also observed that 
when increasing GO density, the dye-rejection rate did not increase. The rejection 
rate was also affected by the charge of the dye particles and their hydration radius. 
Nanocellulose Membrane for Water Treatment 419 Since the hydration radius is high for VBB (0.94 nm) and its charge is positive, it is 
easily rejected compared to MV2 (0.65 nm, positively charged) and R6 G (0.60 nm, 
negatively charged). 
The hydrophilic character of the membrane results in swelling of the membrane, 
which will reduce the wet strength and increase the membrane fouling. In the above 
study, it was found that the hydrophilic characteristics of the CNF/GO membrane 
(contact angle 75°–83°) decreased substantially compared to CNF (contact angle 
23.8°) and GO (contact angle 42.9°) because CNF and GO interact via hydrogen 
bonding, which reduced the swelling of the membranes. The water uptake of the 
GO-CNF membrane was estimated by soaking it in water for 24 hours, and it was 
only 1.2 times its weight compared to 6.7 times when only the CNF membrane was 
used. This decreased hydrophilicity increased its modulus and strength character￾istics, even in the wet and re-dried state. 
Due to their quick response time, powerful oxidation capacity, and broad 
application for the removal of organic pollutants, sulphate radical-based advanced 
oxidation processes (AOPs) be an effective technique for environmental treat￾ment. Amiralian et al. prepared magnetic NC (MGCNF) membranes using CNF 
as a template on which magnetic nanoparticles having a size of less than 20 nm in 
diameter were synthesized using the co-precipitation method (Amiralian et al. 
2020). For the degradation of RhB, peroxymonosulphate (PMS) was used as an 
oxidizing agent, which was activated by the iron-oxide nanoparticles grafted onto 
the CNF. The sulphate radicals (SO4·−
) produced through the catalytic reaction 
with iron-oxide nanoparticles during catalytic reaction degraded the RhB dye 
molecules (Table 15.3). It could be observed that, with the increase in CNF 
content, the crystallite size of the magnetic nanoparticles, as well as the con￾centration, were reduced. This resulted in the reduction of saturation magneti￾zation of MGCNF and a decrease in the degradation efficiency for RhB due to a 
decrease in catalytic activity. 
MoS2 is a bifunctional photocatalyst/adsorbent which has the potential for 
removing the organic pollutants from water through the assistance of photo￾catalysis. Ferreira et. al. prepared BC/MoS2 membranes with a higher specific 
surface area (98−137 m2
/g), and a maximum pore volume of 0.36 cm3
/g, due to a 
broader distribution of larger mesopores (Ferreira-Neto et al. 2020). The effi￾ciency of the samples was analyzed under three conditions, viz. dark, visible light 
and UV light. The photocatalytic reaction enhanced the adsorption ability of the 
membrane substantially compared to pure bacterial nanocellulose (BC), which 
had less response to visible and UV light, hence no considerable improvement in 
adsorption performance. The removal efficiency was found to be 96 ± 3% within 
120 minutes for organic pollutants and 88% ± 3% within 120 minutes for Cr(VI) 
due to adsorption and photoreduction. The reusability was unaffected up to six 
uses with only a slight decline in performance (<10%) and negligible leaching of 
MoS2 into water (<0.03%). 
The adsorption performance and catalytic degradtion of dyes of pristine NC 
can be improved by functionalization. Georgouvelas et al. prepared three types 
of cellulose-based membranes using CNC, TEMPO-oxidised CNF (TO-CNF), 
and CNC-grafted polycysteine methacrylate (PCysMA) (CNC-g-PCysMA) for 
420 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications analyzing the removal efficacy of metal ions such as Au (III), Co(III) and Fe(III) 
and dyes such as MB and RhB from water (Georgouvelas et al. 2021). Cellulose 
fibres were used as the base of the membrane to provide good permeability and 
strength. All three CNC, TO-CNF, and CNC-g-PCysMA membranes exhibited 
good water flux, regardless of the added functional layers, with total pore volume 
estimated at 0.03 m3
/g for all membranes. TO-CNF showed higher metal ad￾sorption capabilities, 78.6 ± 3 mg/g and 70.0 ± 2 mg/g for Co(III) and Fe(III), 
respectively, due to the availability of carbonyl groups, compared to CNC and CNC￾g-PCysMA, while CNC removed 31.9 ± 1 mg/g of Au(III) due to the availability 
of hydroxyl groups. Since TO-CNF is mostly negatively charged, it removed the 
highest amounts of MB dye, as it is cationic, through electrostatic interaction 
(Georgouvelas et al. 2020). Hydrogenation of MB and RhB dyes using NaBH4 ex￾hibited only 20% and 50%, respectively, but, when used with the membranes, it 
showed a drastic increase amounting to 30%–60% and 100% for MB and RhB. 
Among the membranes, TO-CNF exhibited higher efficiency in the hydrogenation of 
MB whereas CNC for RhB. 
Carbon dots (CDs) are zero-dimensional carbon-based materials that can be

Nanocellulose Membrane for Water Treatment 421 performance. Ahn et al. prepared carbon dots (CD) NC (CD@CNF) composite 
for the removal of methylene blue (MB) dye from water (Ahn, Pak, and 
Kim 2021). Three samples were mainly used for experimentation, CNF (10 gsm, 
20 gsm and 30 gsm), CD-CNF and CD@CNF. For analyzing the release effi￾ciency, three dyes were used, they are vitamin B12 (VB12), orange G (OG), 
methylene blue (MB) and VB12 + OG + MB mixture. Among them, MB was 
cationic by nature, OG was anionic and VB12 was neutral. The CD@CNF 
composite membrane outperformed all its counterparts in terms of rejection rate, 
reusability, and stability under high pressure due to its CD-enveloped CNF 
structure. The MB rejection rate was 96% as a result of the strong affinity be￾tween CD and MB. Even from a mixture of MB, OG and VB12, CD@CNF could 
remove 99.1% of MB. CD@CNF exhibited an increased rejection rate and high 
water flux compared to pristine CNF and CD-CNF due to its structural stability 
against water pressure (Ahn, Pak, and Kim 2021). 
NC aerogel membranes are nowadays used for water decontamination appli￾cations due to their high porosity (99%) and large surface area compared to 
traditional membranes. The weak hydrogen bonding between CNF is a major 
problem in maintaining the wet strength of aerogel membranes during high￾pressure water-filtration applications. Through the incorporation of polyvinyl 
alcohol (PVA) and montmorillonite K10 (M-K10), the strength of the aerogel 
membrane can be improved. Luo et al. prepared aerogels using CNF, PVA, and 
M-K10 to overcome the poor mechanical properties of pristine NC aerogels 
(Luo et al. 2021). Tempo-oxidized CNF (TOCNF) was used as the main element 
of the aerogel considering its high adsorption capacity for organic solvents. 
TPMA aerogel also exhibited good compressibility, i.e., even after 100 cycles of 
compression at 60% strain, TPMA retained 93% of its original height due to 
the high strength skeleton between PVA and CNF. The good compressibility 
and fatigue resistance of TPMA was highly favourable for high-pressure water 
filtration. Regarding the adsorption capacity and rate of MB, during the initial 
rapid adsorption, the adsorption rate of MB increased with time due to the 
concentration difference of MB, and thereafter, it slowed down due to the un￾availability of adsorption sites in the aerogel. The adsorption of MB was due to 
electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding (Luo et al. 2021). 
15.10.3 REMOVAL OF MICROORGANISMS 
Pathogens can produce various ill effects on the human body. It is therefore obvious 
that the removal of microbes is an essential task in making water potable. Unlike 
metal ions and dyes, even a small percentage of pathogens present in water can 
reach such a level that it will mitigate its overall usability and will be transferred to 
water bodies upon contact with affected water. In this way, diseases can spread 
across societies without direct social interaction. Mainly bacteria, viruses, and 
protozoa impair water usability to a large extent. NC-based membranes are a good 
choice for microbial removal due to their hydrophilic nature and controllable 
porosity (Gopakumar et al. 2018). 
422 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications One way to address this problem is through the use of an NC paper membrane 
for the filtration of microorganisms. The viruses and micro-organisms can be re￾moved from water by size exclusion, through nanofiltration and ultrafiltration 
techniques (Mautner and Bismarck 2021). Unlike conventional methods, here 
bacterial NC was used as a dispersion in low surface-tension organic liquids: al￾cohol (ethanol), ketone (acetone), and ether (tetrahydrofuran)) for improving the 
porosity of the membrane without altering its pore size for a better water flux. The 
density of the membrane was much lower compared to water-dispersed BC due to 
the lower surface tension of organic liquids, which reduced capillary forces; but as 
the pore size is a function of fibril diameter, it was unaffected. Four samples were 
prepared, namely BC (dispersed in water), BC-Ac (dispersed in acetone), BC-Et 
(dispersed in ethanol), and BC-THF (dispersed in tetrahydrofuran). The gsm of BC￾org papers was 500 kg/m with a porosity of 67% compared to BC having 1500 kg/m 
and 33%, respectively (Sehaqui et al. 2011). The mechanical strength of BC-org 
was affected by the high porosity and was found to be much lower than that of BC 
(Hsieh et al. 2008). BC is highly affected by membrane compaction due to its highly 
dense structure, resulting in a substantial decrease in permeability compared to BC￾org, for which the permeance was less affected, due to its looser fibril network 
structure. For BC, the permeance was 29 L/m2 h MPa at 20 gsm and 6 L/m2 h MPa 
at 65 gsm against 1000 L/m2 h MPa at 20 gsm and 250 L/m2 h MPa at 70 gsm for 
BC-org, almost 40 times higher permeance. Separation performance was assessed 
by using 10, 15, and 20 nm gold nanoparticles (NPs). BC rejected 100%, BC-Et 
rejected 99.7%, BC-Ac rejected 98.5% and BC-THF rejected 96.6% NPs. Even 
though the separation performance was somewhat better for BC, this can be 
overcome by the high porosity, lower material requirement, and high efficiency of 
BC-org papers (Orsolini et al. 2016). 
In another study, a hybrid material was prepared by grafting CNC with 
polysulfobetaine methacrylate (PSBMA) for removing fouling agents and bac￾teria from contaminated water. The materials selected for this study were CNC 
and LCNC (lignocellulose nano crystal) as base materials and poly (sulfobetaine 
methacrylate) (PSBMA) for grafting onto the membrane. The LCNC is CNC 
from which the lignin part is not completely removed because lignin shows an￾tifouling and antibacterial properties due to the phenolic structure and the pre￾sence of carbonyl and carboxylic acid functional groups on the side chains. 
LCNC also requires less time and effort to be produced and produces less waste 
compared to pristine CNC. However, lignin hinders the grafting of PSBMA on 
LCNC; hence, the grafting is negligible. In this study, the inhibition of viable 
bacteria and antifouling properties of three materials, LCNC, CNCE, and CNC-g￾PSBMA were compared. E.coli was used as the microorganism. From the agar 
diffusion method, CNC-g-PSBMA exhibited a larger inhibition zone amounting 
to 1.6 ± 0.2 mm compared to 1.4 ± 0.3 mm for LCNC. This is because the 
adsorption of proteins on LCNC was very high, due to the hydrophobic nature of 
lignin and high saturation point, compared to CNC-g- PSBMA (Georgouvelas 
et al. 2020). The higher amounts of protein adsorption onto the surface of LCNC 
reduce its antibacterial ability. 
Nanocellulose Membrane for Water Treatment 423 15.10.4 REMOVAL OF OIL 
Oil spilling into water from various sources such as tankers, offshore platforms, 
drilling rigs, and wells can considerably reduce its quality. Oil tends to float or 
submerge in water depending on the relative density. Besides, the oil film can move 
along water bodies according to currents and winds. This can seriously affect all 
kinds of marine animals and plants. Highly volatile and less viscous oils normally 
float on water surface, evaporate very easily and produce less damage compared to 
highly viscous and less volatile oils. The methods generally used for oil removal are 
oil skimming, burning, centrifugation, use of oil-absorbing materials, and mem￾brane separation. Membrane separation is found to be more cost-effective and ef￾ficient (F. Huang et al. 2021). 
The problems faced by all water-filtration systems are that the superhydrophobic￾superoleophilic nature of the filtration membranes causes oil to clog the passage and 
reduce water flux, and the difficulty in removing oil from the filter elements hence 
affects the life of the membrane. To remedy this, membranes prepared from BNC that 
exhibit hydrophilicity due to the availability of hydroxyl groups, a porous network 
and, a high surface area can be used to prepare membranes for water and oil se￾paration. The reason behind the usage of BNC instead of CNC or CNF is its purity 
compared to other forms of NC. Ashrafi et al. (2021) prepared a BNC membrane for 
the removal of oil from an oil/water mixture by confining water in the BNC matrices 
and repelling oil. The authors analyzed the membrane’s effectiveness under both 
gravity and pressure-driven conditions. The overall porosity of the membrane was 
estimated to be 84.3% ± 2.3%. Water-infused membranes hence show super￾oleophobicity toward other organic liquids, which prevents oil from penetrating the 
membrane. When the BNC membrane is exposed to water, it immediately absorbs 
water and becomes superoleophobic with a contact angle of 174.5 ± 2.5°. The reason 
behind this superoleophobic nature is the reduction in the coefficient of friction when 
the membrane becomes wet, which is around five times lower than when it is dry. 
Since no oil particles can reach the membrane surface, they can prevent oil fouling 
and can be reused with a separation efficiency of >99.9% even after multiple uses. 
The water flux was found to be inversely proportional to the thickness of the mem￾brane and directly proportional to the feed pressure. Even though the membrane can 
withstand up to 100psi, a linear increase in water flux was found in the 0–20 psi 
pressure range only. The water flux was also estimated to be 140.35 ± 15 L/m2 h for a 
1.1 ± 0.054 mm thick BNC membrane, which is in the range of commercial filters 
(Ashrafi et al. 2021). 
Huang et al. (2021) developed a composite membrane (PML) using super￾hydrophobic ployvinylidenefluoride (PVDF) and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) 
and grafting lauric acid on the surface for the separation of oil/water mixture. The 
membrane was prepared by mixing a PVDF solution and MCC, which was stirred 
for 10 hours at 25°C. Then, the dispersion was kept in a quartz mould for 6 hours at 
60°C to obtain a dry PVDF-MCC (PM) membrane. As we know, cellulose is a 
hydrophilic material, to impart hydrophobic behaviour to PM, lauric acid (having 
good hydrophobicity) was grafted onto the PVDF-MCC(PM) membrane. Five types 
424 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications of oils were selected for experimentation: kerosene, xylene, petroleum ether, n￾hexane and oleic acid. The oil/water mixture was formed by mixing 10 mL oil and 
10 mL water along with a blue dye. The thermal stability of the membrane in the 
range of 30°C–600°C was analyzed. The weight of the PML membrane started to 
decrease drastically after 200°C. The contact angle of 153° ± 2° shows the extent of 
hydrophobicity of the PML membrane, which in turn, positively affects the se￾paration efficiency, which was increased from 93.8% to 99.54%, and the water flux 
reached 8800 L/m2 h. The mechanism of separation is due to the hydrophobicity of 
the membrane; water cannot penetrate the membrane, while oil is adsorbed into the 
membrane, separating it from water. The time required for separation depends on 
the viscosity of the oil petroleum ether, n-hexane and xylene were separated in 
2 min due to their low viscosity, whereas kerosene took 4–5 minutes and oleic acid 
around 30 minutes because of its high viscosity. The water flux was also drastically 
affected by the viscosity of the oils. The flux of n-hexane was the largest, reaching 
8800 L/m2 h, for petroleum ether and xylene, the fluxes were above 5000 L/m2 h, 
and the flux of oleic acid was the smallest, about 130 L/m2 h due to its high 
viscosity. The biodegradability of the membrane could be observed during its 
usage, its hydrophobicity and weight decreased by a certain percentage every week 
and by the sixth week, it began to break down (F. Huang et al. 2021). 
15.11 TYPES OF MEMBRANE SEPARATION TECHNIQUES 
PRESENTLY IN USE 
Among water-purification techniques, membrane filtration is nowadays used as an 
efficient method instead of traditional methods such as flocculation, sedimentation, 
distillation, etc., due to recent developments in membrane technology. The most 
widely used membrane-filtration technique is reverse osmosis (RO) for both waste￾water treatment and desalination purposes. Other membrane-filtration techniques are 
nanofiltration (NF), microfiltration (MF), and ultrafiltration (UF) (Gupta and Ali 2013). 
The range of pollutants that can be removed by different filtration mechanisms 
is given in Figure 15.3. It is observed that membranes with a pore size less than

Nanocellulose Membrane for Water Treatment 425 But they have the disadvantage of requiring higher driving pressure for a con￾siderable water flux. It is evident that for better purification, pore size is of para￾mount importance. The types of membrane materials can greatly affect the 
separation performance based on their physical and chemical properties. 
15.12 CONCLUSION 
NC is an excellent alternative to nonbiodegradable polymer membranes for water 
purification in comparison to traditional separation membranes. It exhibits su￾perior separation efficiency, low energy consumption, abundance, low cost, and 
produces no secondary pollution. The main advantage of NC is that it can be 
custom-tailored to suit any situation. The availability of hydroxyl groups on the 
surface of NC membranes can be easily modified to impart its specific char￾acteristics to adsorb a wide variety of pollutants. In addition, its high porosity is a 
highly favourable property for higher water flux and lower energy consumption. 
The porosity can also be modified by varying the diameter of cellulose fibres. The 
high mechanical strength, tensile strength, and elastic modulus of NC fibrils 
allow them to withstand higher water pressure as in reverse osmosis. It can also 
withstand temperatures up to 300ºC without decomposing, which enables it to be 
used in membrane distillation as well. The hydrophilic nature only permits water 
to pass through the membrane and adsorb contaminants. Chemical inertness is 
another important property desired for long-term usage, it increases the life span 
of the membrane. Most traditional membranes face fouling due to scaling of 
contaminants, which is not the case with NC due to its hydrophilic nature. NC can 
be used either as a standalone material for a membrane or as an additive to 
improve the properties of traditional membrane materials irrespective of their 
nature, such as nanocrystals, nanofibrils, and bacterial NC (Y. Liu and Liu 2021). 
NC can be incorporated with organic or inorganic additives to impart specific 
properties that NC alone cannot achieve. 
15.13 FUTURE SCOPE 
The uses of NC in water purification are still in the developing stage. More 
studies are needed to achieve the best possible outcome from NC-based mem￾branes. Nowadays, most of its practical applications in water purification consist 
of incorporating it into traditional membranes as a surface coating or as a 
composite additive due to the lack of economic ways of extraction of NC and 
lack of technology to prepare membranes using NC on an industrial scale. Even 
though it has improved the efficiency of current water-purification methods 
drastically, its potential is not yet completely exploited. Even though, NC fulfils 
most of the characteristics that are needed in a membrane material, its certain 
disadvantages, like shorter life span, prone to fouling, weak chemical resistance 
and weak high-temperature resistance (Y. Liu and Liu 2021), also need to 
be addressed. Further research in this field is necessary for the near future 
to mitigate the global water crisis.

16.1 INTRODUCTION 
The pollution of oily waste in water bodies arising from oil tanker spillage, 
submarine pipeline failure, and industrial oil-carrying effluent incurs catastrophic 
impacts on environment, ecology, and public health. As the largest oil spill in 
history, the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, also named the Gulf of Mexico Oil 
Spill, occurred at ~70 km southeast from the coast of Louisiana, USA in April 
2010, and leaked up to 3.2 million barrels of crude to the gulf. Though the oil rig 
was recapped within 3 months to avoid further spillage, no end to its disastrous 
consequences can be seen today. According to the National Geographic (Meiners 
2020), the marine mammalians living in the associated area have experienced a 
substantial increase in the reproduction impairment rate; meanwhile, disorder of 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003245261-19 431 lung and heart function was reported among people in contact with the oil. 
Therefore, technologies for efficient and effective removal of such oil pollutants 
from contaminated water is urgently demanded. 
Traditional strategy for oily waste cleanup is in-situ burning, in which case the 
floating heavy oil is burned and consumed. However, this strategy is unfavored due 
to safety concerns and the generation of huge quantities of toxic exhaust and re￾sidues. More popular methods under active investigation include booms/skimmers, 
use of dispersant, bioremediation, and sorption, which can be implemented solely or 
in combination with one another (Hongzhi Liu, Geng, et al. 2017). Yet, the asso￾ciated challenges, such as the poor collection efficiency of small oil droplets 
(booms/skimmers), enlarged oily waste affected area and secondary pollution (use 
of dispersant), and inferior processing efficiency and incomplete oil digestion 
(bioremediation), reduce their value for oily waste cleanup in a green and sus￾tainable way. In comparison, sorption, which can be applied without or with booms, 
stands out as a facile, highly efficient, cost-effective oily waste cleanup alternative, 
and is widely believed to be green and sustainable due to its reduced environmental 
footprint (Lu et al. 2021). 
Both inorganic and organic materials can be used to prepare sorbents for oily waste 
cleanup, though they show certain differences in characteristics and performance. 
Inorganic sorbents, made from finely grained mineral particles or aerogels, are gen￾erally able to contain up to ~20 times their own weights in oil. Typical feedstocks for 
inorganic sorbent include fly ash (J. Wang, Han, and Zhang 2016), zeolite (Wen et al. 
2013), silica (B. Liu, Zhang, et al. 2017), graphite (T. Zhang et al. 2020), and gra￾phene (Bong et al. 2015). Due to the presence of hydrophilic groups on mineral 
surfaces, many inorganic sorbents possess poor selective sorption in removing oily 
waste from water. In addition, the inherent high density of inorganic materials 
commonly makes the sorbent too dense to float on the water after oil cleanup and 
hence increases the difficulty of recovery. Another limitation for inorganic sorbent, 
particularly for the widely studied silica aerogel, is that the porous structure of 
aerogel-type sorbent can be severely and irreversibly damaged due to the capillary 
force generated during oil sorption and the brittle nature of inorganic sorbent, making 
these sorbents not competent for multiple-time oil removal. Carbonaceous aerogel 
(for example, graphene, carbon nanotubes, and carbon fibers) represents a novel type 
of inorganic sorbent that gives excellent oil sorption capacity (several hundred times 
its own weight in oil) and sufficient mechanical robustness for reuse (Maleki 2016; 
Torres et al. 2021); nevertheless, the complicated manufacturing procedure and 
high energy intensity remain to be resolved before they are suitable for massive 
commercialization. 
Organic sorbents, based on the origin of feedstocks, can be further classified into 
synthetic polymer and bio-derived sorbents. Common synthetic polymers such as 
polyethylene (Zhao et al. 2016), polypropylene (G. Wang and Uyama 2016), 
polystyrene (Lee et al. 2013), polyurethane (Guselnikova et al. 2020), and rubber 
(Hao Liu and Kang 2018) have all been studied for oil/water separation. The fea￾sibility of manufacturing into low-density aerogel/foam and its intrinsic hydro￾phobicity and oleophilicity endow these synthetic polymers better floatability and 
greater oil sorption capacity compared to the inorganic ones, i.e., up to hundreds of 
432 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications times of the sorbent’s weight. Although they have excellent performance in se￾lectively and efficiently removing oily waste from water, concerns about their 
nonrenewable nature, poor degradation kinetics, and long-term negative impacts on 
environment make them less attractive from perspective of minimum ecological 
footprint. 
Sorbents derived from plant and animal residues, on the other hand, have 
recently drawn extensive attention regarding technological development and the 
public’s increasing awareness of sustainability. Particularly, sorbents originating 
from plant or wood industry by-products feature advantages including renew￾ability, low cost, massive availability, nontoxicity, and relatively low environ￾mental impacts. A spectrum of cellulosic feedstocks has been proposed for 
sorbent production, such as pulp (Z. Liu et al. 2021), cotton (Zijie Wang, Wang, 
and Liu 2016; Lv et al. 2018), corn stover (T. Xu et al. 2021), bagasse 
(Abdelwahab, Shukry, and El-kalyoubi 2021), and functionalized wood (Fu et al. 
2018), as well as cellulose nanomaterials isolated from bacteria cellulose (J. Guo 
and Catchmark 2012), and marine animals (G. Zhu et al. 2018). As opposed to 
synthetic polymers, one key advantage of bio-derived sorbents is the inclusion of 
certain groups in their structures that are susceptible to microbial activities, such 
as the β-1,4-glycosidic (for cellulose) and peptide (for protein) bonds; these 
structure features enable the used product more likely to be cut down into low￾molecular-weight blocks over time, which can more easily undergo biodegrada￾tion and lead to reduced environmental footprint. Regarding the cleanup effi￾ciency of oily waste, the sorbents constructed directly from pristine natural 
materials tend to give moderate sorption capacity for oil (up to ~50 times of their 
own weight) and certain unwanted water uptake, due to the presence of surface 
hydroxyls groups. Having these hydrophilic groups blocked or modified into 
more hydrophobic/oleophilic one is hence commonly deployed for improved oil 
sorption capacity with greater selectivity. 
In addition to material types, different sorbents can also be categorized based 
on another dimension – the structural form they are designed or engineered into 
for use. Traditional sorbent, such as powders, grains, and beads, is relatively easy 
and cheap to produce, especially for those made from inorganic materials; 
however, the intractable post-treatment remains as a challenge, and the un￾recovered sorbent materials after oily waste cleanup may even pose a potential 
secondary hazard to the contaminated area. In contrast, porous aerogel or foam is 
much more favored as it maintains the integrity of the matrix during oil sorption 
and makes it easier to recover such sorbent. Moreover, increasing the porosity of 
foam or aerogel reduces the apparent density of sorbent, making it readily able to 
float on water; the interconnected porosity provides channels to enable oil transfer 
into bulky sorbent and meanwhile provides essential vacancy to accumulate and 
hold oil. All these factors collectively suggest the great potential of aerogel or 
foam sorbent in oily waste cleanup. 
This chapter will focus on cellulosic-based sorbents from perspectives of 
favored performances and the common strategies to achieve them. The cellulosic 
sorbents include two major types, and both will be discussed in this chapter: 
(i) nanocellulose-based porous materials, such as aerogel/foam, which is 
Nanocellulose for Oily Waste Cleanup 433 assembled from micro-/nano-scale cellulosic materials or, in other word, follows 
a “bottom-up” strategy in structural design; and (ii) modified wood, in which case 
pristine bulk wood, with part of their constituents eroded and removed, is func￾tionalized to obtain preferential affinity with oil, following a “top-down” strategy. 
A schematic of nanocellulose- and modified wood-based sorbents for oily waste 
cleanup is given in Figure 16.1. It is also noticeable that there were studies 
proposing super-hydrophilic, super-oleophobic porous materials for oily waste 
cleanup, where the water went through the aerogel filter and left oil on top of it 
(Paul et al. 2016); despite constructed from nanocellulose, these materials are not 
covered in this chapter as they are not used as sorbents but follow a different oil/ 
water separation mechanism. 
16.2 KEY EVALUATORS FOR OIL SORBENTS 
Regardless of the great variability in feedstock, modification strategy, and assembling 
method, different oil sorbents can be evaluated and compared based on certain key 
characteristic parameters associated with their physical properties and performance, 
including apparent density, oil sorption capacity, oil/water sorption selectivity, and 
mechanical robustness. 
16.2.1 APPARENT DENSITY 
Sorbent’s apparent density ( a) determines its floatability and is of vital im￾portance when considered for marine oily waste cleanup. For nanocellulose 
aerogels made through ice-templating and freeze drying (or supercritical fluid 
drying), their a only depends on the material’s concentration in the precursor 
suspension. According to Martoïa et al. (2016), once a minimum concentration is 
reached (mostly in the range of 0.1%–6%), the nanocellulose can sufficiently 
interact with each other and hence form a self-supportive network after removal 
of the dispersant. This makes it viable to produce nanocellulose aerogel with 
a tunable in a large range, i.e., from ~0.5 g/cm3 to below 0.01 g/cm3 (Sakai et al. 
2016). The threshold concentration is affected by the morphology (primarily 
FIGURE 16.1 Schematic of nanocellulose- and modified wood-based sorbent for oily waste 
cleanup. 
434 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications geometry and aspect ratio) of the nanocellulose, their orientation during packing, 
and the interactions among them. Studies have demonstrated that a clear negative 
correlation between the threshold concentration and the aspect ratio of nano￾cellulose, i.e., threshold concentrations of 1% and 5.9% corresponding to aspect 
ratios of 200 and 11.5 (Jennings, Kropp, and Scrivener 2013; Jawaid, Boufi, and 
Khalil HPS 2017), respectively. Further elevating the concentration above the 
threshold value increases the collision probability among nanocellulose; this leads 
to more frequent overlapping and more intensive interaction among different 
nanocellulose, which results in higher a of the porous materials (Martoïa et al. 
2016). On the other hand, for foams made via air-drying, the a not only depends 
on the concentration of the precursor suspension but may also be affected by the 
network’s shrinkage during the drying process, which is reflected by a denser and 
more rigid network structure. 
For modified wood sorbent, since the volume of bulky wood barely changes during 
modification treatment, its a is a function of its original wood density and the extent 
of component removal (such as lignin and hemicellulose). Apparently, lightwood 
feedstocks with a low density, such as balsa (density of 0.09–0.16 g/cm3
), are more 
suitable to develop sorbent with low a (Guan, Cheng, and Wang 2018). 
16.2.2 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES 
Regarding mechanical properties, certain mechanical robustness is required for 
sorbent to maintain as an integer and preserve its microscale topography when 
immersed in the oil/water mixture and during oil sorption. This is particularly 
important for nanocellulose-based porous sorbents since their structure is assembled 
from micro-/nano-scale cellulosic materials that can be dispersed or even fall apart 
in contact with water or oil (Ferreira, Rezende, and Cranston 2021). Structural 
reinforcement for improved mechanical integrity in water and oil is essential for 
sorbents, and this can be achieved via physical and/or chemical crosslinking; 
meanwhile, hydrophobization treatments allow sorbents to repel water from en￾tering and wetting their internal structure, which can prevent structural disin￾tegration due to the competing hydrogen bonding of water molecules. More details 
regarding both structural design and hydrophobization approaches for improved 
structural integrity will be discussed in the later section. Compared to porous sor￾bents, modified wood sorbents have advantages in terms of better mechanical ro￾bustness, as the compact stacking and alignment of natural cellulose fibers in the 
cell wall are well preserved and help maintain the structural integrity when used for 
oily waste cleanup in complicated oil/brine system (Wu et al. 2021). 
One common method to evaluate the mechanical properties of sorbents is 
compression test, in which most cellulosic sorbents display a 3-regime curve in 
compression stress and strain, though a sharp transition between neighboring re￾gimes is not commonly seen: (i) elastic structural deformation before reaching the 
yield limit, showing a proportional stress-strain relationship; (ii) plastic deformation 
after reaching the yield point where structural collapse starts to occur, giving a 
quasi-flat stress-strain curve; and (iii) material densification where cellulose chains 
are deformed and forced together, indicating a sharp stress-strain increment (De 
Nanocellulose for Oily Waste Cleanup 435 France, Hoare, and Cranston 2017). The compression stress-strain curve of 
nanocellulose-based porous materials is impacted by various factors, including 
nanocellulose morphology, aerogel/foam a, as well as porosity and size distribu￾tion; on the other hand, the oriented assembly of nanocellulose and structural an￾isotropy induced by unidirectional cryogenic templating could lead to distinctly 
different compression behaviors between the perpendicular and parallel directions 
relative to the major nanocellulose alignment (Mi et al. 2018; L. Zhou et al. 2019). 
Generally, sorbents with a high yield strain and proper elastic modulus are bene￾ficial for sustaining large quantity of oil, and recycling and multi-time use, as the oil 
contained can be released and collected readily by squeezing. 
16.2.3 POROSITY AND SORPTION CAPACITY 
The capacity of how much oil can be absorbed and contained by the sorbent is 
presented in the unit of g per g sorbent (in dry), and often uses various oils, organic 
solvents, and hydrocarbons as models of oily wastes. Apart from sorption se￾lectivity, which will be discussed in Section 2.4, the oil sorption capacity of a 
sorbent is associated with its porosity (or internal vacancy), which theoretically 
equals to the volumetric fraction of the vacancy enclosed by the macroscopic 
geometric boundary of the bulk sorbent. The total geometric porosity of a porous 
cellulosic material can be calculated using Equation 16.1, which provides an esti￾mation of the oil sorption capacity. 
porosity = 1 × 100% a
cellulose
(16.1) 
Based on difference in diameter, the sorbent’s total internal vacancy can be clas￾sified into macro- (d > 50 nm), meso- (2 nm < d < 50 nm), and micro-pores (d < 2 
nm). Particularly, the large pores (macro-pores) play a significant role in oil 
sorption and containment as they represent the predominant volume; in comparison, 
tiny pores (meso- and micro-pores), only occupying a small portion of the total 
vacant volume, many of which are even inaccessible for oils, are less relevant with 
oil sorption. As a useful analytical technique for direct measurement of the total 
accessible space, mercury porosimetry is conducted by pressurizing the non-wetting 
liquid (often mercury) into the porous sorbent until the intruded liquid volume 
plateaus, followed by depressurizing and quantification of the contained liquid 
volume (by calculating the reduced free liquid amount) (Giesche 2006). It has been 
used in many studies to quantify the porosity of cellulosic materials (Sescousse, 
Gavillon, and Budtova 2011; Joshi et al. 2016) and is considered more accurate in 
measuring the accessible pores (Hossen et al. 2020). 
Another common representation of a material’s porosity is specific surface 
area (SSA), typically measured using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) isotherm. 
Since SSA is relatively easy to quantify but is in essence critically dependent on 
tiny pores including meso- and micro-pores, it is not directly related to a mate￾rial’s oil sorption capacity. SSA is mostly in the range of 1–600 m2
/g for cellulose 
436 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications and lignocellulose materials (Ferreira, Rezende, and Cranston 2021). For porous 
materials prepared in a “bottom-up” strategy, SSA is a function of drying method 
and feedstock characteristics. For drying procedure, that includes the evaporation 
of liquid dispersant; the adjacent cellulosic fibers are forced to move closer by 
the capillary force at thin intervening liquid between them, leading to a low SSA 
of the aerogel/foam. Hence, suppressing the capillary force facilitates aerogel 
preparation with high SSA, which can be achieved by reducing the surface ten￾sion of the liquid (γ) as the capillary force is proportional to γ. For instance, 
foams fabricated from water dispersion with ambient drying typically give a low 
SSA of below 10 m2
/g, due to the relatively high γ of water (72.8 mN/m at 20°C) 
(Ferreira and Rezende 2018); in contrast, foams prepared from dispersion of low￾γ liquid, such as isopropanol (γ of 23.0 mN/m at 20°C), enable a considerably 
greater SSA of up to ~100 m2
/g (Ganesan et al. 2016). Further suppressing the 
capillary force can be achieved by pivoting from ambient drying to supercritical 
or cryogenic dryings. In supercritical drying, the original liquid dispersant is 
diluted and removed by another fluid at supercritical conditions, while no inter￾facial meniscus exists and hence no capillary force is generated; as a trade-off 
of the relatively high cost of supercritical fluid operation, aerogel with ultrahigh 
SSA of ~600 m2
/g can be obtained (Heath and Thielemans 2010; Darpentigny 
et al. 2020). In cryogenic drying which is relatively more economic, the original 
dispersant is phase-transformed into a solid followed by direct sublimation, 
so that no liquid state is involved in the drying, neither is the capillary force. 
The aerogels prepared from cryogenic drying give an improved SSA of up to 
~300 m2
/g (Nemoto, Saito, and Isogai 2015; G. Li et al. 2017). Such value is 
much lower than that prepared through supercritical fluid drying, which is rea￾sonable as the micro-/nano-scale cellulose are pushed together by the formed 
crystals during cryogenic treatment, which leads to materials’ overlapping and 
aggregation. Since the space occupied by the frozen dispersant (typically ice) is 
directly associated with the internal vacancy of the resultant aerogel, minimizing 
the size of frozen crystals to inhibit the formation of large dispersant crystals 
is important in developing aerogels with a high SSA. 
For modified wood, the sorption capacity is dominated by the porosity of the 
original wood and affected by the porosity generated during component (lignin and 
hemicellulose) removal as well. Though modified wood typically shows a low 
porosity and a low SSA (tens of m2
/g) as its cellulose matrix remains integral during 
treatment for vacancy creation, the cellular structure and the cellulose nanofibril’s 
orientation of the pristine wood can be well preserved, and the open cell lumens 
can provide space for oil sorption and storage. 
16.2.4 SORPTION SELECTIVITY 
Sorption selectivity is a key parameter for evaluating sorbents’ performance since 
they are expected to contain as much oily substance as possible but minimum water 
from an environment where both oil and water exist. Pristine nanocellulose and 
wood materials possess massive surface hydrophilic groups, primarily hydroxyls. 
Hence, certain hydrophobization treatment is necessary to be applied to these 
Nanocellulose for Oily Waste Cleanup 437 pristine materials, to strengthen their van der Waals and hydrophobic interaction 
with oily fractions and therefore to achieve satisfactory sorption selectivity. Three 
major hydrophobization strategies for cellulose materials will be discussed in detail 
in the next section. 
16.3 PRODUCTION PROCESS OF NANOCELLULOSE￾OR MODIFIED WOOD-BASED SORBENTS 
As driven by the urgent need of transitioning from traditional, nonrenewable ma￾terials into carbon-neutral, high-efficiency, and renewable alternatives, considerable 
progress has been achieved during the last decade in developing high-performance 
sorbents for oily waste cleanup from nanocellulose or wood. Technologies proposed 
to achieve sorbents with favored properties, including low a, high porosity, sa￾tisfactory mechanical robustness, and good sorption selectivity, will be discussed 
from two perspectives, i.e., structural design and hydrophobization method. Owing 
to the intrinsic difference in preparation approach, nanocellulose-based aerogel/ 
foam (“bottom-up” strategy) and modified wood-based sorbent (“top-down” 
strategy) will be discussed in separate subsections. 
16.3.1 NANOCELLULOSE-BASED AEROGEL/FOAM SORBENTS 
As discussed in Section 16.2, the inherent hydrophilicity of cellulosic materials 
makes it essential to carry out certain crosslinking and hydrophobic treatment for 
enhancement in structural integrity and oil sorption selectivity and capacity. It is 
noticeable that for nanocellulose-based porous materials, their crosslinking and 
hydrophobization can be achieved in separate steps, but they can also be accom￾plished in a single step or using a single additive; meanwhile, it is likely that more 
than one crosslinking (or hydrophobization) strategy is implemented synergistically 
for an improved performance. Details of common crosslinking and hydrophobiza￾tion practice for cellulose aerogel/foams are discussed in the following subsections. 
Key processing parameters and sorbent properties of selected representative works 
are given in Table 16.1. 
16.3.1.1 Crosslinking 
According to the type of interaction, crosslinking strategies for preparing 
nanocellulose-based aerogel/foam can be classified into physical crosslinking 
(physical entanglement and electrostatic interaction) and chemical crosslinking 
(covalent bonding). 
16.3.1.1.1 Physical Crosslinking 
Cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) or bacterial cellulose (BC) that are dispersed in liquid 
can form physical entanglement which mechanically reinforces the structure as￾sembled during either air drying, or cryogenic treatment (ice-templating) and 
freeze-drying, or supercritical drying. Though the strength of physical entanglement 
depends on various factors, CNF or BC with high aspect ratio and flexibility are 
more commonly used than cellulose nanocrystals (CNC); to a certain extent, this is

Nanocellulose for Oily Waste Cleanup 443 similar to the case of the threshold concentration for stable porous structure (dis￾cussed in Section 16.2.1), where structures with high aspect ratio and certain 
flexibility allow much lower threshold concentration to form a self-supportive 
structure. In contrast to CNF and BC, CNC are mechanically rigid and low in aspect 
ratio. The aerogels made solely from CNC via physical crosslinking alone are 
hardly to preserve good mechanical integrity when dipped in water or subject to 
mechanical compression. 
Sourced from a variety of woody and grassy plants, CNF are widely identified 
as platform materials to produce aerogel/foam for separation and purification 
purposes. CNF originated from a bunch of agricultural and forest resources, in￾cluding kraft pulp (Korhonen et al. 2011), bamboo (Z. Xu, Zhou, et al. 2018), 
poplar (Chen et al. 2016), cotton (Gu et al. 2021), as well as recycled paper board 
(Jeddi, Laitinen, and Liimatainen 2019), have been studied for oil sorbent fab￾rication purpose. With the capability of forging mechanically durable aerogel via 
intra- and inter-fibril hydrogen bonding, CNF can be assembled into strong 
aerogel by itself for sorption purposes. For example, Jiang and Hsieh reported the 
construction of amphiphilic aerogel from 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy 
(TEMPO)-mediated oxidized CNF using ice-templating (−20°C) and freeze￾drying (F. Jiang and Hsieh 2014), which exhibited good structural integrity at a 
very low a of 1.7–8.1 mg/cm3 and ultrahigh porosity of up to 99.9%. Such high 
porosity enabled aerogel a high sorption capacity of liquid, i.e., 210 g water or 
375 g chloroform per g sorbent. A more recent study by Qin et al. demonstrated 
that the microstructure of purely CNF-based aerogel can be drastically modified 
by a two-stage ice-templating/freeze drying technology (Qin et al. 2021). As 
shown in Figure 16.2, aerogel made from conventional ice-templating (at −20°C)/ 
freeze drying of CNF suspension gave a honeycomb structure with firmly￾compacted, nonelastic walls. In contrast, a first liquid-nitrogen ice-templating (at 
−196°C) enabled the assembly of dispersed CNF into sub-micron fibers due to 
suppressed ice growth; such materials can be reconstructed into aerogel with 
hierarchical micromorphology during a second conventional ice-templating/ 
freeze drying. These structural features endowed the aerogel superb mechanical 
robustness, with superelasticity confirmed by cyclic compression tests and 
compression demonstrations under extreme conditions (high mass load or ul￾tralow temperature; Figure 16.2). After silanization modification, this superelastic 
aerogel showed a very high contact angle of 164° and a superb chloroform 
sorption capacity of 489 g/g sorbent, which were among the highest of all dis￾closed values so far (Table 16.1). 
For nanocellulose that carry charged functional groups, such as the carboxylic 
acid groups in TEMPO-mediated oxidized CNF, adding counter-ion additives 
such as multi-valent metal ions or polycations can prompt more robust physical 
crosslinking via electrostatic interactions. Yang and co-workers proposed the 
development of composite aerogel using CNF and sodium alginate (SA), both 
carrying carboxylic acid groups, with Ca2+ as the cationic crosslinker (J. Yang 
et al. 2018). A mixed suspension of CNF and SA at a mass ratio of 1:7 (in dry) 
was frozen for ice templating in either random or controlled ice growth (in 
unidirectional or bidirectional orientations). After freeze drying, the sample was 
444 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications immersed in diluted CaCl2 solution, which allowed penetration of Ca2+ into the 
material network and fostered stronger bridging between CNF and SA chains. 
Such practice was found to effectively reduce the swelling deformation/collapse 
and improve the structural integrity of SA/CNF aerogel in water. Improved hy￾drophobicity was achieved using silanization with contact angle increased from 
0° to 148.7°, which enhanced the oil sorption selectivity and led to an improved 
oil sorption capacity of 15–36 g/g sorbent. Particularly, the uniform lamellar 
microstructures obtained using bidirectional ice-templating endowed aerogel 
sorbent excellent elasticity and shape integrity, which allowed a good perfor￾mance retention as reflected by a high oil sorption capacity of ~99% with barely 
changed materials’ contact angle of 144.2° after 40 cycles of oil sorption and 
sorbent regeneration. 
The physically entangled CNF network allows satisfactory stabilization of the 
impregnated additives for improved hydrophobicity or mechanical elasticity,

Nanocellulose for Oily Waste Cleanup 445 where covalent bonding may not be necessary to fix them. For instance, according 
to Lorevice et al. (2020), CNF derived from eucalyptus can be dispersed in water 
and blended with natural rubber (NR; from hevea brasiliensis), followed by 
aerogel fabrication using cryogenic treatment and freeze drying. The resultant 
aerogel showed a low a of 33–37 mg/cm3
, regardless of the initial NR/CNF 
blending ratio; meanwhile, the natural rubber was found to exhibit as nano￾spheres with diameter of ~500 nm and randomly distributed in the physically 
entangled CNF network. Interestingly, addition of small amount of NR (20% in 
the NR/CNF mixture) notably improved the compressive modulus to 600 kPa, 
suggesting good mechanical robustness. With a high SSA of 256 m2
/g, the 
sorption capacity of such aerogel was reported in the range of 10–40 g/g sorbent 
for various cooking oils, organic solvents, and hydrocarbons. Meanwhile, kinetics 
measurement suggested up to 90% of such sorption capability can be accom￾plished within 10 s after the sorbent contacted oily fractions, indicating high oily 
waste cleanup efficiency. 
By blending CNF with graphene oxide (GO) for improved mechanical beha￾vior, Mi and his co-workers fabricated GO/CNF composite aerogels with a low a
of 5.9 mg/cm3 (Mi et al. 2018). The aerogel sorbent in this work was made 
anisotropic via bidirectional freezing, as shown in Figure 16.3. With a high SSA 
of 47.3 m2
/g and implementing hydrophobic treatment using a long-chain silane, 
the composite aerogel achieved a very high contact angle of 150.3° and an oil 
sorption capacity of 80–197 g/g sorbent, which is considerably higher than most 
pristine cellulose aerogels. The anisotropic cellular structure, as well as the 
making use of CNF’s flexibility and GO’s rigidity, endowed the composite 
aerogel excellent elasticity and shape preservation with reduced structural da￾mage after mechanical squeezing, which allowed easy separation of the contained 
oil and ensured the sorbent excellent oil sorption retention over recycling. In a 
more recent study by Gu et al. (2021), reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and nano￾chitosan (NCS) were physically mixed with CNF for aerogel preparation. The 
composite aerogel, notated as RGO/NCS/CNF, showed a high porosity with a low 
density of 9.3 mg/cm3
. The impregnation of RGO and NCS was found to increase 
the contact angle to up to ~115°, leading to an increased oil sorption capacity in 
the range of 120–177 g/g sorbent. 
In addition, physical crosslinking enables the feasibility of incorporating other 
additives into the assembled structure for desired functionality, such as magnetic 
responsiveness. For instance, based on the work by Gu et al. (2020), a CNF aerogel 
sorbent can be facilely constructed via freeze drying with well distributed, im￾pregnated magnetite (Fe3O4) nanoparticles. The involvement of magnetite endowed 
the sorbent good magnetic responsiveness, which is considered of value regarding 
easy recycling of sorbents from a large, contaminated area after oily waste cleanup. 
With oleic acid used as the hydrophobic modifier, the composite aerogel achieved a 
contact angle of 84.5°, which was lower than the values achieved by other studies 
with the use of silanization. However, since oleic acid was merely physically coated 
on the fibrous network, it is doubted that such sorbent can preserve its oil sorption 
selectivity and capacity after squeezing and regeneration, as the coated oleic acid 
446 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications can be dissolved in the contained oil and removed from the sorbent during sorbent 
squeezing and regeneration. 
Different from CNF, BC are produced as secondary metabolite by various 
bacterial species, among which the most effective producers found so far are 
acetobacter xylinum (Z. Li, Qiu, et al. 2018), acetobacter hansenii (Feng et al. 
2015), and acetobacter pasteurianus (Kumar et al. 2019). With a small diameter 
of 20–100 nm and a high aspect ratio of ~50, BC can be prepared into highly 
interconnected, robust porous networks via physical crosslinking. In the work by 
Z. Li, Qiu, et al. (2018), dispersion of cellulose sourced from A. xylinum can be 
used to readily produce aerogel via cryogenic treatment and freeze drying. Such 
aerogel had a low density a of 23.2 mg/cm3 and a porosity of 98.5%, indicating 
its proper floatability. The high SSA of pristine BC aerogel (81.5 m2
/g) provided 
a large surface for downstream cycles of polyhemiaminal (PHA) coating/removal 
for controlled switchability between oleophilicity and hydrophilicity. Due to 
FIGURE 16.3 (a) Schematic, photos, and scanning electron microscopy images (scale bar =

Nanocellulose for Oily Waste Cleanup 447 robust physical crosslinking, the authors claimed that the BC aerogel was strong 
enough to maintain an integrity after three rounds of such cycles, which involved 
the contact with oil, organic solvents, and acidic water (Z. Li, Qiu, et al. 2018). 
16.3.1.1.2 Chemical Crosslinking 
Chemicals with two or more functional groups that facilitate covalent bonding with 
cellulose (typically the hydroxyls) could trigger chemical crosslinking for enhanced 
mechanical properties of the aerogel/foam. A number of synthetic or natural che￾micals have been identified as eligible chemical crosslinkers for cellulosic mate￾rials, primarily including diisocyanate (F. Jiang and Hsieh 2017), epichlorohydrin 
(Ahuja et al. 2021), multi-carboxylic acids (Zhai et al. 2016), and paper wet￾strengthening reagent (V.C. Li, Mulyadi, et al. 2018). In addition, due to the hy￾drophobic nature of most chemical crosslinkers used, the use of such reagents may 
increase the materials’ overall hydrophobicity as well. 
As one of the most reactive molecules to hydroxyls, methyl diphenyl diiso￾cyanate (MDI) has been investigated as hardening agent for CNF aerogel (F. Jiang 
and Hsieh 2017). Since TEMPO-mediated oxidized CNF carried abundant surface 
polar groups (hydroxyls and carboxyls) that can participate hydrogen bonding, CNF 
hydrogel precursor was assembled by a combined ice-templating and ambient 
thawing (notated as FT-CNF) or alternatively, by charge neutralization using hy￾drochloric acid to suppress inter-fibril electrostatic repulsion (notated as HCl-CNF). 
MDI was used at a quite high dosage, with CNF/MDI mass ratio from 1:1 to 1:4; 
due to the limited solubility of MDI in water, the crosslinking process was carried 
out in acetone medium. The freeze-dried aerogel derived from both types of CNF 
hydrogels gave a comparable a in the range of 6.9–8.3 mg/cm3 but distinctively 
different morphology. Specifically, aerogel made from FT-CNF exhibited a multi￾hierarchical structure, with honey-comb scaffolds of 200–500 μm in width; the wall 
of such scaffolds, constructed by assembled CNF, showed a bimodal mesopore 
distribution with peak values of 6 and 60 nm, and hence led to a high SSA of up to 
228 m2
/g. In comparison, aerogel made from HCl-CNF primarily gave a fibrillar 
structure, probably due to insufficient driving force for CNF assembly. Regarding 
the crosslinker’s dosage effect, increased MDI dosage also led to improved aero￾gel’s a with more complete micropore filling (Figure 16.4), which agreed with the 
results of solvent sorption capacity that decreased from 81.7 to 63.6 g/g sorbent. 
Notably, due to the presence of diphenyl groups in MDI, the MDI-crosslinked CNF 
aerogel showed simultaneously increased contact angle, suggesting that the CNF 
aerogel was turned hydrophobic (Figure 16.4). Meanwhile, all the SSA, compres￾sion modulus, cyclic sorption performance, and thermal stability of the aerogel 
sorbent were found positively correlated with MDI’s amount, which can be at￾tributed to the increased density of crosslinking knots in CNF network and hence 
enhanced mechanical robustness. 
Glutaraldehyde carrying aldehyde groups can condensate polyols and hence has 
been used as chemical crosslinker for preparing CNF aerogel. Xu and co-workers 
reported the development of a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/CNF composite aerogel (Z. 
Xu, Jiang, et al. 2018). The curing of PVA/CNF hydrogel was achieved using 
glutaraldehyde at a PVA: CNF: glutaraldehyde mass ratio of 4:4:1 and 
448 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications accomplished at 75°C for 3 h, followed by ice-templating and freeze drying for 
aerogel fabrication. With a high porosity of ~99% and hydrophobic modification via 
silanization (contact angle increased from 0° to 138°), the aerogel exhibited an oil 
sorption capacity up to 136 g/g sorbent. Interestingly, the glutaraldehyde-cured and 
hydrophobically modified aerogel was found to show excellent structural integrity 
that allowed impregnation of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticle using dip coating in 
ethanol medium, during which structural deformation/collapse was not observed.

Nanocellulose for Oily Waste Cleanup 449 On the other hand, the aldehyde group’s reactivity with hydroxyl and amine groups 
makes glutaraldehyde not only an effective crosslinking agent for cellulose itself 
but may also binding with amine-containing functional additives such as chitosan. 
For instance, Zhang et al. proposed the fabrication of an anisotropic, chitosan (CS)- 
reinforced CNF aerogel using directional freeze casting (M. Zhang et al. 2021). 
With glutaraldehyde serving as the binder, the addition of CS was found to sub￾stantially improve the aerogel’s mechanical strength and resistance to structural 
deformation/collapse, which led to a good elasticity and cyclic sorption perfor￾mance. With a low a of 8.4 mg/cm3 and high porosity of 98%, the composite 
aerogel sorbent after hydrophobic treatment achieved a high sorption capacity in the 
range of 80–253 g/g sorbent. 
Multi-carboxylic acids have also been studied for cellulose crosslinking due to 
their condensation capability with cellulose hydroxyls (Zhai et al. 2016; Shang et al. 
2021). Zhai and co-workers demonstrated the preparation of PVA/CNF micro￾spherical aerogel using 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) as crosslinking 
agent via esterification (Zhai et al. 2016). After ice-templating and freeze drying, 
the covalent bonding was facilitated at 140°C, resulting in a mechanically robust 
aerogel. In a recent study by Shang et al. (2021), BTCA was used as crosslinker for 
preparing pure CNF network. With the esterification reaction catalyzed using so￾dium hypophosphite (NaPO2H2), a robust aerogel with low density (6 mg/cm3
) and 
high porosity (99.6%) was obtained. After hydrophobic modification using silane, 
the aerogel gave a high solvent sorption capacity of up to 226 g/g sorbent, with a 
good performance retention of 170 g/g sorbent (75% of the original) after 30 cycles. 
Compared to small molecule crosslinkers that carry a few binding sites, poly￾meric crosslinking agents not only facilitate chemical bonding with cellulose ma￾terials but also endow physical entanglement with cellulose network, which 
collectively led to inter-connected network with further improved mechanical 
properties. Polyamidoamine epichlorohydrin (PAE), which has a commercial name 
of “Kymene,” is a reactive polycation that can condensate with various functional 
groups due to its azetidinium groups; hence, it has been used to cure biopolymers, 
including cellulose (V. C. Li, Mulyadi, et al. 2018; Gong et al. 2019) and protein/ 
peptides (Y. Zhu, Chae, Wang, et al. 2021; Y. Zhu, Chae, Adhikari, et al. 2021). 
Zhang and co-workers accomplished the initial explorative study to crosslink mi￾crofibrillated cellulose (MFC) with PAE (W. Zhang et al. 2012). The MFC/PAE 
composite hydrogel was physically blended and made into aerogel using ice￾templating and freeze drying, while the condensation between PAE’s azetidinium 
groups and MFC’s carboxyl groups was achieved afterward at 120°C for 3 h. The 
crosslinked aerogel exhibited improved structural integrity when immersed in 
water, as opposed to pure MFC aerogel that disassembled instead. A roughly ne￾gative correlation was observed between the aerogel’s sorption capacity and 
crosslinker’s dosage, which can be attributed to the increased density of cross￾linking knots and therefore less macropore volume for liquid sorption. However, 
due to lack of further hydrophobic treatment, it is anticipated that the composite 
aerogel retained poor sorption selectivity without further modification. 
As aforementioned, the inherent mechanical rigidity and low aspect ratio of CNC 
makes it not suitable for fabricating flexible sorbent purposes, unless its surface 
450 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications is intensively functionalized to facilitate assembled network with improved cross￾linking. A representative work for the former case is accomplished by X. Yang and 
Cranston (2014), who partially substituted the surface hydroxyls of CNC with either 
aldehyde or hydrazide (-NHNH2) groups. After mixing and driven by ice￾templating, the CNC-CHO and CNC-NHNH2 were pushed together and fostered 
the condensation of aldehyde and hydrazide groups into hydrazone, which resulted 
in CNC network crosslinked by covalent bonds. Such crosslinking was found to be 
more stable in aqueous environment, while irreversible structural collapse was 
observed when the aerogel was compressed in dry. Due to the rigid nature of CNC 
and less overlapping between CNC in aerogel than that made from CNF, the made 
aerogel gave an SSA of 250 m2
/g, which is among the highest for freeze-dried 
aerogels of all types; as a result, a high sorption capacity of 50–130 g/g sorbent was 
achieved. It needs to be noted that due to the lack of hydrophobic treatment, this 
CNC aerogel sorbent showed preferred sorption of water than oily solvents, which 
is associated with the hydrophilicity induced by the unreacted hydroxyls at CNC 
surface. As reported by Ma et al. (2017), the CNC-NHNH2 used in X. Yang and 
Cranston (2014) can be replaced by other lower-molecule-weight hydrazone￾carrying reagents, such as 1,4-benzenedicarbonylhydrazone. 
Another way to incorporate CNC in aerogel sorbent is incorporating it as 
an additive to reinforce the aerogel that contains another polymer as the pre￾dominant constituent. Gong and colleagues developed sorption materials using 
CNC-reinforced PVA aerogel (Gong et al. 2019). The crosslinking was accom￾plished using epichlorohydrin, an agent that reacts rapidly and efficiently with 
the hydroxyls carried by both CNC and PVA. After silanization, a high contact 
angle of 144.5° was achieved, which in together with the aerogel’s low a of 
22.5–36.1 mg/cm3 and high porosity of > 97.7% resulted in an oil sorption 
capacity of 21–33 g/g sorbent. 
16.3.1.2 Hydrophobization 
Depending on type of reagent used and process involved, technologies for hydro￾phobic modification of cellulose aerogel/foam can be generally classified into three 
groups: (i) nanocellulose or aerogel physically blended with hydrophobic agent, 
such as graphene (Chatterjee, Ke, and Liao 2020); (ii) nanocellulose or aerogel 
chemically functionalized using hydrophobic reagent, such as silane (Cervin et al. 
2012) and acyl chloride (Phanthong et al. 2018); and (iii) thermal treatment (or 
pyrolysis), which removes the surface hydroxyls at high temperature and is more 
suitable for as-assembled sorbents (Z. Xu, Zhou, et al. 2018). The increased hy￾drophobicity and oleophilicity can be evaluated in terms of elevated contact angle. 
16.3.1.2.1 Physical Blending 
Typical additives, such as carbonaceous materials, natural rubber (NR), hydro￾phobic polymer or wax, and certain types of surfactants, can be incorporated into 
BC- or CNF-based aerogel/foam via physical blending to improve the composite 
materials’ hydrophobicity. The carbonaceous additives mainly include carbon 
nanotubes and graphene derivatives, such as graphene oxide (GO) (Mi et al. 
2018), RGO (Gu et al. 2021), and esterified graphene (EG) (Chatterjee, Ke, 
Nanocellulose for Oily Waste Cleanup 451 and Liao 2020). For instance, Nie and co-workers reported the fabrication of 
CNT/BC composite aerogel with a low a in the range of 4–11 mg/cm3 achieved 
for aerogels contain 0%–10% CNT (Nie et al. 2019). Regarding hydrophobic 
modification performance, the incorporation of 5% and 10% CNT substantially 
improved the aerogel’s contact angle from 77° to 106° and 123.3°, respectively. 
Meanwhile, such results were compared with the aerogels made from carboxylic 
carbon nanotubes (CCNT), a hydrophilic CNT derivative, which reversibly re￾duced the aerogel’s contact angle to 34.5° and 24.6°, at a dosage of 5% and 10% 
CCNT with respect to the composite, respectively. This well demonstrated the 
improved hydrophobicity introduced by CNT blending, with oil sorption capacity 
improved by 2–4 times to 80–120 g/g sorbent as opposed to pristine BC aerogel. 
Wang and colleagues proposed a facile method to physically combine BC with 
one of two types of graphene derivatives that produced GO/BC and RGO/BC 
aerogel with an ultra-high porosity of ~99.9% (Y. Wang et al. 2014). Due to a 
lesser presence of hydrophilic groups in RGO compared to GO, aerogel made 
with RGO showed better oil sorption selectivity than the other. The incorporation 
of RGO, even at a low dosage of 20% in the blend, remarkably increased the 
composite aerogel’s oleophilicity and led to a high oil sorption capacity of up 
to 150 g/g. 
NR was physically blended with CNF by Lorevice et al. (2020), for composite 
aerogel sorbent development. As discussed in Section 3.1.1.1, a low a of 33–37 
mg/cm3 was achieved for the composite aerogel, regardless of the initial NR/CNF 
blending ratio, and the NR nano-spheres were well distributed and stayed stably in 
the CNF network. The incorporation of NR nano-spheres increased the composite’s 
contact angle from 60° (pure CNF aerogel) to ~90° (20% NR in mixture), which 
allowed an increased water/oil sorption selectivity from 40% to 90% (percentage 
volume of aerogel pores occupied by oil). 
PHA, prepared using paraformaldehyde and 4,4’-diaminodiphenyl ether, pro￾vides an approach for temporary hydrophobization of aerogel sorbent. As reported 
by Z. Li, Qiu, et al. (2018), BC aerogel coated with PHA showed a substantially 
increased contact angle to 136° with a satisfactory SSA of 46.5 m2
/g. These col￾lectively led to a sorption capacity for a bunch of oil and organic solvents in the 
range of 20–61 g/g sorbent. The switchable wettability of PHA/BC aerogel, realized 
by the ease of PHA depolymerization into water soluble monomers in acidic 
conditions (pH = 1), allowed controlled removal of the contained oil from porous 
sorbents after oily waste cleanup and helped regenerate BC for next-cycle PHA 
coating and oily waste cleanup (Z. Li, Qiu, et al. 2018). The authors also claimed 
good recyclability of the BC aerogel sorbent for three cycles; however, no data was 
provided for this argument. 
16.3.1.2.2 Chemical Modification 
Compared with physical blending, introducing hydrophobic functionality by 
covalent bonding has drawn more attention due to its superior and more robust 
performance. Common techniques for such purpose include chemical vapor de￾position (CVD) (Gong et al. 2019). Atomic layer deposition (ALD) (H.C. Guo 
et al. 2017), cold plasma treatment (J. Shi et al. 2013), sol-gel process (Sai et al. 
452 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 2014), and esterification (Phanthong et al. 2018), with the use of silanes 
(Ahuja et al. 2021), alkyl amine (Gao et al. 2018), alkyl ketene dimer (Tarrés 
et al. 2016), plastics precursor (Mulyadi, Zhang, and Deng 2016), and alkyl acid 
chloride (Phanthong et al. 2018). Among all the techniques, CVD is the most 
extensively used due to low reagent dosage, high processing efficiency, and ex￾cellence in hydrophobic modification performance. Typically conducted in an 
enclosed chamber, CVD processing involves the migration of a gas precursor of 
a hydrophobizing reagent to the surface of target materials (aerogel) for coating. 
Various types of silanes, with their molecular structures partially given in 
Figure 16.5, are usually chemically bonded to nanocellulose-based aerogels via 
CVD. Silanization coating usually endows the aerogels excellent oleophilicity 
and hydrophobicity, with reported contact angle of materials mostly above 130° 
(Table 16.1) and some even exceeding 150° (superhydrophobic surface) (Cervin 
et al. 2012; F. Jiang and Hsieh 2014). For example, the amphiphilic aerogel made 
by Jiang and Hsieh can be modified by triethoxyl(octyl)silane using CVD to 
substantially suppress the aerogel’s hydrophilicity (F. Jiang and Hsieh 2014); as 
a result, the water sorption capacity of the aerogel was remarkably reduced 
from 210 to 11.4 g/g sorbent. Sanguanwong et al. hydrophobized carboxylic 
CNF/sepiolite composite aerogel with methyltrimethoxysilane using CVD 
(Sanguanwong et al. 2021). The resultant hydrophobic aerogel showed an im￾proved contact angle to 121°–128°, which in together with the low a (6 mg/cm3
) 
and high porosity (99.5%) led to a high oil sorption capacity of 90–138 g/g 
sorbent. 
Gao and co-workers demonstrated superhydrophobic surface (contact angle of 
152.5°) by utilizing octadecylamine coating (Gao et al. 2018). For improved coating 
performance, polydopamine (PDA) was initially in-situ polymerized on nanofi￾brillated cellulose (NFC) surface, which served as the anchoring interlayer for 
further chemical bonding with octadecylamine to form Schiff’s base. The resultant 
FIGURE 16.5 Representative silanes and silane derivatives that have been investigated for 
hydrophobic modification of nanocellulose-base aerogel/foams. 
Nanocellulose for Oily Waste Cleanup 453 hydrophobic aerogel displayed a very low a of 6.04 mg/cm3 and a high SSA of 
93.1 m2
/g, with its oil sorption capacity characterized to be up to 176 g/g. It is 
interesting whether the surface hydrophobicity and high oil sorption capacity can be 
retained after recycling, or in other words, whether the ternary NFC/PDA/octade￾cylamine design is robust under mechanical compression. However, no relevant 
discussion was provided. 
Organometallic compounds, such as titanium tetraisopropoxide, Ti(OCH 
(CH3)2)4, have also been investigated for hydrophobic modification (Korhonen 
et al. 2011; Chin, Romainor, and Pang 2014); however, the performance is not as 
good as those of other approaches. As reported by Korhonen et al. (2011), TiO2 
coating of 7 nm in thickness was achieved at nanocellulose aerogel using sol-gel 
method with Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4 as the hydrophobizing precursor, with oil sorption 
capacity of 20–40 g/g sorbent reported for various mineral oil and organic solvents. 
In a more recent work by Chin et al., the oil sorption capacity of resultant aerogel 
reached 28 g/g sorbent, despite the fact that the pre-coating aerogel substrate (i.e., 
Fe3O4-impregnated regenerated cellulose aerogel) was dried using supercritical 
CO2 drying for improved SSA (Chin, Romainor, and Pang 2014). The oil sorption 
capacity of TiO2-coated aerogels in both studies does not exceed 40 g/g sorbent, 
which may be attributed to reduced hydrophobicity of metal oxide coatings, or the 
enclosure of partial pores in the aerogel during TiO2 coating that makes such pores 
inaccessible for oil sorption. 
Instead of implementing hydrophobic post-treatment to as-assembled aerogel, 
it can also be directly applied to CNF, followed by conversion of the hydrophobic 
CNF into aerogel. Mulyadi and colleagues investigated the potential of hydro￾phobizing CNF using in-situ polymerization at CNF surface (Mulyadi, Zhang, 
and Deng 2016). Specifically, a mixture of hydrophobic monomers (n-butyl ac￾rylate, styrene, and ethylene dimethylacrylate) at mass ratio of ~0.9:1 with respect 
to CNF was added dropwise into CNF dispersion, where radical polymerization 
was initiated by potassium persulfate; the purified hydrophobic CNF was further 
frozen and freeze-dried to generate aerogel, with PAE used as the crosslinking 
agent. Owing to the in-situ coated styrene-acrylate copolymer on CNF surface, 
the assembled aerogel, with a of 23.2 mg/cm3 and porosity of 98.5%, exhibited 
excellent hydrophobicity with a contact angle of 149°. Similar to hydrophobized 
CNF, CNC can also be surface modified before blending with additives for 
aerogel fabrication. Zhu et al. proposed the valorization of tunicate-sourced CNC 
and red mud (RM), an alumina industry waste, into functional composite aerogel 
(G. Zhu et al. 2018). The isolated CNC was hydrophobized using methyl￾trimethoxysilane, prior to being chemically bonded to ball-milled RM with 
hexamethylene diisocyanate as the crosslinker; such pre-hydrophobic modifica￾tion was essential to ensure a good oleophilicity and hydrophobicity of the final 
aerogel, especially considering the hydrophilic nature of both pristine CNC and 
RM constituents. The aerogel demonstrated an oil sorption capacity of up to ~35 
g/g sorbent. Meanwhile, due to the incorporation of inorganic clays, the com￾posite aerogel possessed a compression modulus at the magnitude of 104 kPa, 
much greater than that of most CNC-containing aerogels. However, since the 
sorbent regeneration was achieved not by compression, but through rinsing the 
454 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications oil-containing aerogel in toluene for recyclability, it remains unknown how well 
the mechanical elasticity of such composite aerogel was. 
16.3.1.2.3 Thermal Treatment 
Apart from incorporating hydrophobic additives via physical blending or che￾mical bonding, thermal treatment (pyrolysis) provides a distinctly different ap￾proach to improving nanocellulose aerogel’s hydrophobicity by partially or 
completely removing the hydrophilic hydroxyls of nanocellulose, depending on 
the temperature and duration of thermal treatment. Due to loss of materials, 
structural shrinkage is commonly observed during thermal treatment. For in￾stance, the study by Wang et al. demonstrated the preparation of hydrophobic 
aerogels from carboxylic CNF aerogel precursors (M. Wang et al. 2017). The 
pyrolyzed aerogel had a much smaller volume than the precursor after staged 
thermal treatment with highest temperature of 1000°C (Figure 16.6). The made 
aerogel sorbents achieved a contact angle of 139.6°, which along with the low a
of 8.8 mg/cm3 contributed to a high oil sorption capacity of 110–260 g/g sorbent. 
Regeneration of the used sorbent can be achieved by either direct burning or 
distillation, while the cyclic ethanol sorption capacity was different from one case 
to the other (Figure 16.6). Long et al. recently proposed the complexation of 
carboxylic CNF and choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvent (DES) for 
composite aerogel as precursor for pyrolysis (Long et al. 2021). After processed 
FIGURE 16.6 Photos of aerogel precursors and carbonized aerogel sorbents prepared by

Nanocellulose for Oily Waste Cleanup 455 at selected temperature in the range of 200–750°C for 2 h, the annealed aerogels 
showed a remarkably elevated contact angle from <1° to 129.7°; yet, the rela￾tively high a of 112 mg/cm3 restrained the oil sorption capacity (5–12 g/g sor￾bent). After oil sorption, the sorbent can be regenerated by direct burning, which 
made subtle damage to the carbonaceous network and enabled sorbent reusing for 
at least 100 times. 
16.3.2 MODIFIED WOOD-BASED SORBENTS 
Different from nanocellulose-based sorbents that are designed and constructed 
using a “bottom-up” strategy, wood-based sorbents are prepared following a “top￾down” strategy, primarily including two key steps: (i) creating in-situ vacancy in￾side wood structure, mostly by removing lignin and hemicellulose, and (ii) hy￾drophobic treatment to enhance oil sorption selectivity. Due to their inherent 
difference in feedstock and process design, the sorbents made from nanocellulose 
and wood show distinct structural difference primarily from two perspectives: (i) a
for the former can be as low as ~1 mg/cm3
, while a for the latter is mostly higher 
than 50 mg/cm3 as it is restricted by the feedstock’s density and the limit of internal 
vacancy creation; (ii) the former can be made anisotropic or isotropic (by different 
templating methods), while the latter is essentially anisotropic as the structure of 
cell lumen derived from natural wood is retained. Studies on wood-based sorbents 
with key parameters are summarized in Table 16.2. 
Guan et al. developed highly hydrophobic wood-based foam sorbent from 
balsa wood, due to its inherent low density of 92 mg/cm3 (Guan, Cheng, and 
Wang 2018). As illustrated in Figure 16.7, the lignin and hemicellulose com￾ponents present in the wood were removed in turn using sodium chlorite and 
sodium hydroxide treatment, respectively, leading to a free-standing, purely 
cellulosic anisotropic matrix with superb elasticity and mechanical robustness. 
Hydrophobization of such matrix was achieved using CVD with methyl￾trimethoxysilane as the functionalizing reagent, leading to the generation of 
superhydrophobic surface with a high contact angle of 151°. In the work by 
Wu et al., balsa wood was also used as the feedstock with similar approaches 
implemented to remove lignin and hemicellulose (Wu et al. 2021). 
Hydrophobization of the isolated cellulose network was achieved by a combi￾nation of: (i) thermal treatment at 800°C for 6 h, followed by (ii) liquid phase 
silanization conducted at 60°C for 2 h using hexane solution of dihydroxyl￾terminated polydimethylsiloxane, tetraethoxysilane, and ditin butyl dilaurate; the 
first step appeared to be less effective, while the superhydrophobic surface (an 
ultrahigh contact angle of 154°) of the fabricated sorbent was mainly attributed to 
the silanization treatment. Interestingly, the Joule-heating behavior of the made 
foam sorbent enabled heating upon applied electric potential or electromagnetic 
radiation, and hence, facilitated heavy oil sorption/desorption by reducing its 
viscosity. However, due to the relatively high a as aforementioned, the porosity 
of wood-based sorbents in both cases is not as high as those of nanocellulose￾based ones, resulting in a comparatively lower oil sorption capacity, i.e., 41 g/g 
sorbent for Guan et al.’s study.

Nanocellulose for Oily Waste Cleanup 457 16.4 SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK 
This chapter demonstrates the importance of dealing with oily waste pollution, one 
of the major issues challenging environment, ecology, and public health. A pro￾mising green and sustainable approach to resolving such problems is using 
nanocellulose- or modified wood-based sorbents, which are reviewed technically 
from two perspectives: key performance evaluators and production strategy. The 
information and discussion included in this chapter shall provide readers insights to 
develop more sustainable, lower cost, and market-ready sorbents from cellulosic 
feedstocks for oily waste cleanup. To move forward with the technology devel￾opment, the following three factors are worthy of consideration.

458 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications • Procedure safety. Many chemical hydrophobization techniques, such as 
silanization, involve the use of toxic precursors and specific equipment. 
This makes the processing more complicated and increases both capital 
and operational cost for scale-ups. Identifying greener and less toxic 
chemical reagents, as well as seeking for suitable, highly hydrophobic 
physical blending additives, can be of great interest in terms of 
commercialization. 
• Real scenario evaluation. So far, most sorbents developed for oily waste 
cleanup are evaluated in terms of oil sorption selectivity and capacity 
based on their performance in treating model oil/water mixture. Yet, real 
scenarios, such as cleanup of sea oil spillage, are much more complex due 
to water salinity, which could impact the sorbents’ performance sub￾stantially but have been barely discussed. On the other hand, the impact of 
using sorbents on aquatic life should be well assessed, which is vital to 
avoid any secondary pollution beyond oily waste. 
• Life cycle assessment (LCA). As elaborated by Jungang Jiang, Zhu, and 
Jiang (2021), even though the inherent sustainable nature of cellulosic 
materials has been widely acknowledged, discussion on their environ￾mental and ecological perspectives is commonly limited to the feedstock 
renewability and reuse of the end products, which is oil sorbent in this 
chapter. Nevertheless, important aspects regarding carbon footprint related 
to the synthesis of chemicals, water intake, energy consumption, and 
chemical and solvent loss during recycling have barely been discussed. A 
comprehensive LCA of sorbent products involving all reagents, energy, 
and resources is strongly suggested to provide a fair comparison of the 
environmental impact among different technologies.

17.1 INTRODUCTION 
The availability of pure drinking water, especially for rural population and under￾privileged groups, is one of the main concerns for the global research community. 
Moreover, due to the rapid rise in population, urbanization and farming activities 
have escalated the demand of pure water across the world. In the meantime, un￾treated or partially treated chemicals released from industries like pharmaceutical, 
leather, painting, textile, etc., have deteriorated the freshwater resources. 
Contamination due to heavy metals (lead, arsenics, mercury, Fluoride) and 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003245261-20 467 microorganisms have affected the lives of humans by causing kidney, liver, and 
infectious diseases (Ouni, Ramazani, and Fardood, 2019). 
According to global surveys, almost 75% of people on earth live in the areas 
where they face drinking water problems regularly. The scientific community 
observed that water treatment is one of the solutions to overcome these water￾scarcity problems. Until now, various traditional and conventional technologies, 
like ion exchange, ultra-filtration, adsorption, electro-precipitation, membrane 
filtration, reverse osmosis, and some advanced oxidation processes are mainly 
used in water purification (Nasrollahzadeh et al., 2021). These conventional 
technologies are not cost-effective or accessible for large, needy populations and 
require upgrading for removal of wide chemicals (Nasrollahzadeh et al., 2018; 
Yargıç et al., 2015). The advent of carbon-based materials over the past few 
decades, as shown in Figure 17.1, including fullerenes (spherical carbon mesh 
built of C atoms with sp2 hybridization via Euler’s theorem), carbon nanotube 
(CNTs, 1D carbon nanostructures comprising of cylinders of sp2
-hydbridized C 
atoms several nanometers in diameter and numerous microns in length), graphene 
(a 2-dimensional monolayer of sp2
-hydbridized C atoms in a honeycomb lattice), 
activated carbon and carbon dots are proving a great boon in the rapid growth of 
human civilization (Iijima, 1991; Novoselov et al., 2007). 
Pyrolysis (Cho et al., 1996), chemical vapor deposition (Ren et al., 1998), 
electrolysis (Terrones et al., 1996), arc discharge (Iijima and Ichihashi, 1993) 
and laser ablation (Thess et al., 1996) are widely used methods in the fabrication 
of carbon nanomaterials. The existing source of raw material includes methane, 
benzene, and coal products put bar in cost-effectiveness. The challenges like 
FIGURE 17.1 Carbon Nanomaterials. 
468 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications cost-effective materials, large availability to normal people for water purification 
have motivated the scientific community for exploring renewable, economical 
carbon sources in synthesizing carbon nanomaterials for numerous applications 
to the development of society (Wang et al., 2018). The present chapter discussed 
the fabrication method for carbon-based nanomaterials using renewable re￾sources and their application in water treatment. Carbon nanotubes, activated 
carbon, graphene oxide, and carbon dots for application on water treatment. 
Moreover, the molecular dynamic (MD) simulation tool is discussed to evaluate 
the water treatment method. 
17.2 CARBON NANOTUBES 
Over the last decade, CNTs have drawn attention of scientific community for water 
purification and treatment applications. CNTs can potentially be used for techno￾logical innovation in terms of improving water treatment due to being eco-friendly 
and cost-effective and because of their specific surface area, strong sorption, fast 
kinetics (Kar et al., 2012), thermal stability, and conductivity (Sharma et al., 2015; 
Sreeprasad et al., 2011; Khan and Husain, 2005). The main advantage of these 
CNT-based membranes is to permit the water more easily by removing the heavy 
metals, microbes, pollutants. Figure 17.2 shows a schematic representation of water 
treatment with CNT. Carbon nanoparticles are of various types, including single￾walled carbon tubes (SWCNTs) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). 
Each carbon-nanotube is made up of a single molecule comprised of millions of 
atoms and the length of this molecule can be tens of micrometers long with dia￾meters as small as 0.7 nm (Dresselhaus, Dresselhaus, and Jorio 2004). Generally, 
CNTs are considered as one-dimensional structures that have a ratio of about 1000 
for large length-to-diameter. The main composition of pure SWCNT can be seen as 
a rolled-up tubular shell of graphene sheet, which comprises of hexagonal rings of 
C atoms like benzene, as shown in Figure 17.3. Graphene sheets comprises of a 
single layer of crystalline graphite derived from a lattice structure and are available 
in cylindrical structures. Usually, SWCNTs consist of only ten atoms around the 
circumference and its tube is only one-atom thick. 
FIGURE 17.2 Water treatment with carbon nanotubes. 
Carbon Nanomaterials 469 A MWCNT is in the shape of concentric cylinders, which is formed by the bunch 
of rolled up graphene. MWCNTs are usually spatially larger consisting of a bunch 
of SWCNTs that were rolled. The multiwalled carbon nanotubes is confined to 
nanostructures with outer diameter of less than 15 nm, also called carbon nanofi￾bers. CNTs are totally different from carbon fibers because they contain bunch of 
layered graphite sheets, but no single molecules (Lin et al., 2003; Dresselhaus et al., 
1998). Multiwalled CNTs, discovered by Iijima in 1991 (Iijima, 1991) possess a 
unique design and interesting properties, such as peak tensile strengths, good 
moduli, high aspect ratios, low densities, good strength in characteristics like 
chemical, thermal, and electrical conductivity. These different properties of CNTs 
from other materials have given a path to wide range of applications in devices used 
for energy conversion and storage (Zhang et al., 2009; Gonzalez-Valls and Lira￾Cantu, 2009); semiconductor equipment (Stobbe et al., 2006); probes (Larson et al., 
2015; Dremov et al., 2015); wind blades (Ma and Zhang, 2014). 
17.2.1 SYNTHESIS OF CARBON NANOTUBES FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES 
Since the invention of carbon nanotubes (Iijima, 1991), it acts as one of the widely 
used in nanotechnology due to its superior physical and chemical properties. Recent 
investigations on CNTs reveal its potential for water treatment. Figure 17.4 shows 
FIGURE 17.3 Graphene Sheets rolled into CNTs. 
FIGURE 17.4 Carbon Nanotubes fabrication method. 
470 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications the methodologies used for fabricating CNTs, including arc discharge, laser abla￾tion, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), electrolysis,hydrothermal, etc. (Janas, 
Dawid 2020). 
Due to the usage of more petroleum products, coal as carbon source for synthe￾sizing CNTs, researchers started developing renewable carbon nanomaterials, which 
can be used for applications, like water purification, energy conversion, etc., as dis￾played in Table 17.1. Microwave irradiation was used to synthesize carbon nano￾material from rice husk. Carbon nanotube is fabricated by sonicating the washed rice 
husk in the ferrocene catalyst to generate plasma to improve the catalytic decom￾position. From experimentation, qualitative carbon nanotubes have been fabricated 
(Wang et al., 2015; Asnawi et al., 2018). Tripathi et al. used an unconventional 
concept and explained the green catalyst assisted bulk CNTs (Tripathi et al., 2017). 
CNTs have been grown using green catalyst synthesized from garden grass (Cynodon 
Dactylon), rose (Rosa), neem (Azadirachta Indica), and wall-nut (Juglans Regia) plant 
extracts. The carbon nanomaterials growth was achieved by CVD technique at 575°C 
using wall-nut extract, while increasing the temperature to 800°C the formation of 
carbon nano-belts (CNBs) was observed, and has been confirmed by high resolution 
electron microscopes, Raman, and IR spectroscopic studies. 
Pamela et al. synthesized the CNTs synthesized using a mixture of biochar and 
ferrocene, heating assisted by microwave (Pamela et al., 2019). Biochar samples 
utilized in the fabrication of CNTs were obtained from agro-industrial wastes like 
wheat straw, oat hulls, rapeseed cake, and hazelnut shells, which are pyrolyzed at 
400°C and 600°C. (Fathy, 2017) fabricated the CNTs by pretreating the rice straw 
hydrothermally using ferrocene and combined catalyst of ferrocene and nickel ni￾trate in the presence gases released from camphor.

Carbon Nanomaterials 471 17.3 ACTIVATED CARBON 
Activated carbon is a highly permeable material that react to extract harmful species 
from polluted water, normally through surface adsorption. It has been proven to be a 
great solution to remove high amounts of microorganisms, wastes from water, 
which is currently used as the most reliable, economical material for domestic 
water-purification devices (Chengfeng and Rongrong, 2019; Song et al., 2015; Du, 
2010; Jie, Min, and Jing, 2018; Triestam, 1999; Archer, 2019). This material has 
been mostly used for designing cartridges in water-treatment devices since it has the 
characteristics that help in removing disinfectant products, pesticides, microbes, 
herbicides, heavy metals released from industrial areas, halogenated contaminants, 
and other substances that affect the water bodies. However, it is not as productive as 
carbon nanomaterials because of its properties like low adsorption rate and surface 
area (Gehrke, Geiser, and Somborn-Schulz 2015). In recent times, by installing new 
modifications to activated carbon substrate, it has improved the devices capability 
of capturing organic and inorganic contaminants. Activated carbon fibers (ACFs) 
had been developed, and it is being used as the new generation solution for water 
treatment. 
17.3.1 SYNTHESIS OF ACTIVATED CARBON 
Commercial-activated carbon is broadly utilized as an adsorbent in water and gas￾purification applications. It can be produced by activating various materials and 
carbonation methods using coal and cellulose raw materials. Recently, more at￾tention has been paid to the use of biomass and different types of bio-waste as 
renewable source materials for activated carbon, as shown in Figure 17.5. The 
existing commercial method for production of activated carbon provides good 
quality product, but they use fossil fuel as raw material which limit them in cost 
effectiveness and sustainability (Bergna et al., 2017). Also, the preparation of ac￾tivated carbon is also an energy-consuming process. Therefore, other substitutes 
such as renewable source adsorbents, must be explored. 
Activated carbons have been prepared by one-step pyrolysis of agricultural 
wastes like apricot stones, cherry stones, and grape seeds, in presence of steam at 
700°C. Activated carbons obtained by this process are suitable for removing Ni, Mg 
and As ions from water (Petrov et al., 1999). For removing mercury effectively 
from water media, authors prepared activated carbon derived from wastes of pis￾tachio wood with help of activating reagent NH4NO3. In this process, almost 97.9% 
of mercury contamination is filtered (Sajjadi et al., 2018). Coconut shell-activated 
carbon is processed into fuel that can replace coal. The process of forming into a 
coconut shell-activated carbon is by drying, pyrolysis, and carbonization. When the 
temperature reaches 500°C, the coconut shell is activated carbon, which can pro￾duce the greatest heat and is durable because of the many elements contained 
carbon and of many pores formed (Sulistyani et al., 2014). 
Table 17.2 lists out the methods for synthesis of activated carbon using re￾newable materials. Activated carbon can also be derived from harmful aquatic plant 
altemanthera philoxeroides (AP). The AP is initially cleaned with deionized water, 
472 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications dried in an oven, pre-carbonized at 450°C. It is then grinded to powder, immersed 
into KOH aqueous solution, and activated at 800°C. The final products were mixed 
with excess 3 M HCl solution, washed with deionized water and finally dried in an 
oven at 80°C. The activated carbon has been synthesized using sugarcane bagasse

Sajjadi et al. (2019) synthesized activated carbon for removing Pb(II) from water, 
which is derived from pistachio wood by two-stage chemical-activation processing

carbon from rice husk has been developed. RHs were first washed with distilled 
water and then ground into powder before the carbonization. Then the RHs are 
heated at 500°C to obtain carbonized rice husks which are added to the KOH so￾lution to obtain a mixture. The mixture is dried and heated up to 600°C–900°C and 
the activated carbon is obtained (Shrestha et al., 2019). 
17.4 CARBON DOTS 
Carbon dots are one of the types of quantum dots that can be extracted from various 
carbon precursors. The CNP was discovered in 2004 by Xu et al. (Xu et al., 2004) 
accidentally, and a SWCNT was synthesized by this group using electrophoresis 
method. Two years later, Sun et al. (2006) gave the term carbon dots, when de￾veloping fluorescent C particles with parameters less than 10nm. The unique 
properties like high water solubility, low toxicity, more biocompatibility, good 
color production under different wavelengths have helped the researchers to work 
on it rigorously. Moreover, using surface doping properties like chemical, physical, 
optical can be enhanced for the carbon dots. Carbon dots can also be used as 
photocatalyst because it can work as an electron donor and acceptor (Zhang et al., 
2018) when doped with various metal ions, functional groups (Namdari et al., 
2017). Figure 17.6 displayed application fields of carbon dots, which includes 
FIGURE 17.6 Applications of carbon dots. 
474 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications biomedical (Sharma and Das, 2019), bioimaging, drug delivery (Feng et al., 2016), 
gene delivery (Liu et al., 2012a), sensing (Qian et al., 2014), and catalysis (Pirsaheb 
et al., 2018). 
17.4.1 SYNTHESIS OF CARBON DOTS 
After the discovery, the synthesis of carbon dots was confined to only materials 
consisting of carbon content. By the passivation of carbon dots, the quantum yield 
and solubility have improved. Over the last decade, several green resources like 
fruits, vegetables, juices, beverages, bakery products, plants, etc. were utilized for 
synthesizing carbon dots. Initially, researchers mostly used cost-effective, renew￾able methods like the hydrothermal (HT) method. Initially, researchers used fruits 
and their derivatives to fabricate green CDs. Wang et al. (2016) extracted carbon 
dots from aqueous papaya which showed a smaller size (2–6nm) and higher 
quantum yield of 18.98% when compared with ethanoic extraction. Moreover, the 
quantum yield and average diameter obtained makes this greater than the CDs 
obtained from grass (Liu et al., 2012b). Liu et al. (2018) utilized pear juice to 
synthesize green carbon dots using the hydrothermal method, which are used for 
determining 96% Cu2+ ions from water samples. Similarly, some researchers also 
synthesized from juices derived from fruits like orange (Sahu et al., 2012), sugar 
cane (Mehta et al., 2014). The quantum yield of carbon dots synthesized using 
lemon juice is around 24.89% at 380nm wavelenth (Hoan et al., 2019). In addition 
to it, fruit peels containing carbon content were also used to fabricate carbon dots 
like lemon or orange peels (Chatzimitakos et al., 2017). From Pomelo peels, (Lu 
et al., 2012) carbon dots were synthesized at 6.9% quantum yield and used for 
removing Hg2+ ions from lake water. 
Kavitha and Kumar (2018) synthesized carbon dots by low-temperature carbo￾nization process with help of palm dates fronds as material with quantum yield of 
33.7%. Feng et al. (2015) developed carbon dots using rose petals via the 
microwave-irradiation method, which showed high QY of 13.45%. Synthesis of 
CDs via the microwave method using lignin (Si et al., 2018), lotus root for detecting 
Hg2+ from environmental water (Gu et al., 2016), and gelatin (Arsalani et al., 2019) 
as a starting material is reported. Teng et al. (2014) synthesized N-carbon dots using 
konjac flour via pyrolysis method. The fabricated N-CDs had high quantum yield of 
22%, average diameter of 3.37nm and also have pH sensing properties. Xue et al. 
(2015) utilized lychee seeds to synthesize green carbon dots, which are water so￾luble with an average blue fluorescence time of 3.9ns. Recently, (Zhang and Ding 
(2019) fabricated CDs derived from marigold flower which was observed that 
quantum yield of 7.84% and also it was combined ethylenediamine to form N-CDs. 
17.5 GRAPHENE OXIDE (GO) 
Graphene oxide (GO) & reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are the main two types 
derived from graphene structures (Lujanienė et al., 2017). In the research com￾munity, graphene oxide (GO) provided a better solution to purify water due to its 
Carbon Nanomaterials 475 high ability of removing heavy metals and high adsorption rate. The existence of 
-OH, -COOH, -C=O, and other hydrophilic groups is one of the vital reasons for 
these characteristics (Wang and Chen, 2015). GO having high functionalized sur￾faces helped to remove impurities like Pb(II) and Hg(II) from water (Zhang et al., 
2014). It has been observed by researchers that GO is only solution to filter con￾taminants because of its high permeability property. 
17.5.1 SYNTHESIS OF GRAPHENE OXIDE 
Table 17.3 displayed the methods for the preparation of GO using renewable 
sources. Mahata et al. (2018a) synthesized an eco-friendly, sustainable r-GO 
form extracts of ocimum sanctum L (tulsi leaves). Initially, the tulsi leaves were 
cleaned and chopped into small pieces and warmed at 35°C around 20 min with 
distilled water, then cooled down. The liquid was filtered from leaves and 10mg 
of GO was combined with 10ml deionized water in a flask, stirred for 30 
minutes. A further 10mL of leaf extract is added to the solution was heated till 
70°C and stirred, which was kept for 4hr to obtain dark black solution. The 
authors cooled the solution and again centrifuged it for 35min at 3500 rpm to 
finally attain the rGO with 92% yield. (Mahata et al. (2018b) used oil wastes 
like oil palm leaves, palm kernel shells, and empty fruit brunches to fabricate 
graphene oxide. In this, authors used carbonization of materials in a furnace 
under N2 gas for 3 hours at temperatures ranging from 400°C to 900°C by 
supplying constant heat of 10°C/min. This method helped in the removal of nitro 
groups in water. Dong Han Seo et al. (2018) developed a renewable membrane 
with soybean oil and polycrystalline Ni substrate via CVD method for proces￾sing seawater.

476 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 17.6 FULLERENE 
Fullerene is an allotrope of carbon in which atoms are packed in a closed shell. In 
this form of carbon molecule, it contains 60 carbon atoms arranged in a dome-like 
structure consisting of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons (Yadav and Kumar, 2008). In 
recent studies, fullerenes materials are utilized for many applications like water 
splitting, pollutant, and bacteria removal from water using photo catalysts (Yao 
et al., 2020). 
17.6.1 SYNTHESIS OF FULLERENES 
Alekseeva et al. (2016) designed a composite using fullerene and polystyrene for 
the removal of metal ion like Cu2+. The adsorption capacity of the nanocomposite 
was found to be 14.6mmol/g for Cu2+ ions. 
17.7 MD SIMULATIONS FOR WATER TREATMENT 
The structural and dynamical analysis of nanoconfined water is a domain of great 
interest among researchers. Authors encounter numerous challenges in applications 
like pharma, water treatment, energy storage and conversion, and geophysical 
processes. In past few years, several experimental and MD simulation studies have 
been used to understand the water flow passing. To understand the mechanisms like 
transport of water and functioning of membranes, mainly information at a molecular 
level needs to be analyzed microscopically as shown in Figure 17.7. To evaluate the 
structural, dynamical characteristics of the amorphous membrane containing 
polymers and transport processes can be visualized using atomistic molecular 
modelling techniques like the MD simulation. 
In MD simulations, mechanism like molecular permeation, factors like chemical 
functionalization and structural parameter can be obtained. Table 17.4 shows the 
FIGURE 17.7 MD simulation on water treatment using CNTs. 
Carbon Nanomaterials 477 MD simulation for water treatment. Borg et al. (2018) observes that using MD 
simulations for water-treatment analysis, provides the flow resistances, predicts the 
flow in fine structures. The simulation studies also give the idea about density, slip 
length, and viscosities for different diameters. Rizzuto et al. (2018) studied the 
effect of number of walls in the MWCNT membranes for desalination applications, 
mainly two different types of MWCNT, i.e., MWCNT (8,8) and MWCNT (6,6) 
were analyzed using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation. For each 
membrane, authors investigated ion rejection and water conductance by applying 
hydrostatic pressure difference. After studies, it is observed that MWCNT (8,8) 
offers good conductance and salt rejection. 
Giri, Amal Kanta, and M. Natália DS Cordeiro (2021) studied about the heavy 
metal ion rejection through graphene membrane using MD simulation by reducing 
interlayer spacing. From investigations, they observed that heavy metals (i.e., Cd2+, 
Cu2+, Hg2+, Pb2+) can pass through 1nm wide membranes and at interlayer spacing 
of 0.8nm, high rejection of metal ion is observed. Fatemi and Foroutan (2016) 
studied the adsorption capacity of CNTs for gas storage and water filtration, from 
results, it is observed that adsorption rate decreases, gas separation increases with 
the increase in temperature. Water permeability, flow dynamics of functionalized 
CNT were studied using MD simulation analysis, and also from analysis, its ion 
rejections is observed clearly (Foroutan et al., 2019). Through MD simulations, 
visualization of flow can be observed effectively and also demonstrated that CNTs 
are more efficient for desalination water. The randomness of flow is observed when 
the pressure gradient is absent (Sahu et al., 2019). NEMD mainly focus on the 
confinement effect of transport of water molecules through CNT membranes. 
Through this simulation, the pore-size effect and pore-size distribution in CNT￾based nanomembranes can be studied (Tao et al., 2018).

478 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications chemicals, dust. Patent CN108002366A Liangti, Cheng, and Zhang (2018) designed 
a graphene foam prepared from solar radiation, which has high contaminants and 
microbes’ removal rates and also have the standards of drinking water. Chen (2018) 
designed a filter containing activated carbon made using bamboo. The filter also 
comprised of other chemicals like NaOH, KOH, octadecyl acrylate, bentonite, and 
silicon dioxide. The filter had a large adsorption capacity and a natural antibacterial 
agent, which purified water. Pan (2018) in his patent authors designed a water 
purifier using sintered activated carbon filter core, in which rod-like activated 
carbon filter is fabricated. In this, activated carbon is prepared from coconut shells, 
ultra-high molecular polyethylene, negative ion powder, and tourmaline powder. It 
is followed by sintering heat treatment of the membrane. After several testings, it 
was observed that it had a strong capability of pollutants and microbes. The main 
advantages of activated carbon filter are easy-to-use, can fabricate by readily 
available raw materials (i.e., coconut shell), low cost, and suitable for large pro￾ductions. Iang (2013) designed a terminal water treatment purifier which mainly 
relates to energy-saving and water-saving advantages. The main advantage of the 
design is the purifier work at low pressure, which improves reduces the energy and 
save water. In the first stage, a microfiltration membrane with a composite mole￾cular sieve is provided whereas in second-stage spherical preparation filled with 
active carbon, connected with a nanofiltration membrane. The water leaves the 
stage 1 enters the stage 2, and after that, it is connected to a purification tank. From 
the purification tank, water can be used in many applications. 
Yabing et al. (2014) fabricated a multifunctional water purifier integrated with 
activated carbon and low-temperature plasma. The main parts of water purifier are a 
storage water tank, a vertical activated carbon bed, a water collecting tank, and a 
plasma reaction device. The main advantages of this water purifier are that it is 
easy-to-use, economically reliable, and also reusable. This invention gives an in￾tegrated multifunctional water-purifying device involving a kind of gas and low￾temperature plasma. Deng (2019) provided a natural water purifier for drinking tap 
water in domestic usage. In this activated carbon purifier, a backwashing technique 
is used to replenish residual chlorine removal capability. By washing it forward and 
in reverse, it removes the adsorbed substances, which are left between the surfaces 
and pores of the carbon particles. Zeng et al. (2017) provided an energy-saving 
water purifier with multistage filtering functions. It comprises a PP cotton filter core 
layer, an ultra-filter membrane core layer, a sintered active carbon filter core layer, 
an ultraviolet ray sterilizing lamp panel, and a display screen. PP cotton filter core 
layer ensures removal of silt- and rust-type ultrafine impurities. Zhu et al. (2014) 
designed a high–precision ultrafiltration water purifier. The purifier liner consists of 
activated carbon arranged in the inner part of the water purifier’s main body. In this 
water purifier, activated carbon is used to remove heavy metals, pesticides, fouling 
smell, taste. This filter also used to remove bacteria.

18.1 INTRODUCTION TO AEROGELS 
Aerogel comprises of a microporous solid, which in the dispersed phase is a gas that 
has properties such as low density and low thermal conductivity. In 1932, Samuel 
Stephens Kistler introduced the term aerogel. He employed the technique of su￾percritical drying to extract liquid components from a gel to produce an aerogel. 
Later, various drying methods were developed, and different types such as silica 
aerogels, carbon aerogels, graphene aerogels, alumina aerogels, and polysaccharide￾based aerogels were produced. 
While conventional aerogels come from nonrenewable resources such as inorganic 
and petrochemical materials, many biomass-based resources have been used over the 
past decade. Polysaccharide-based aerogels are sustainable as the raw materials are 
derived from biodegradable natural resources. These include cellulose, starch, chitosan, 
alginate, carrageenan, and pectin. Among these, cellulose is one of the most abundant 
among natural polymers and is readily available. It has standout properties such as 
biocompatibility, sustainability, low toxicity, and renewability. Polysaccharide-based 
aerogels have notable applications in environmental engineering, building construc￾tion, medical practice, packaging, and electrochemistry, so on (Fricke and Emmerling 
1992; Pierre 2011; Y. Wang et al. 2019). Types of polysaccharide-based aerogels and 
their application according to the year of publication is shown in Figure 18.1. 
18.2 POLYSACCHARIDE-BASED AEROGELS: PRECURSORS 
AND METHODS OF PREPARATION 
18.2.1 PRECURSORS 
Before dwelling on the applications of polysaccharide-based aerogels, here is an 
outline of different sources of biopolymers and their chemical constitution in the 
synthesis of aerogels. 
Cellulose is an abundant organic resource. It is a polysaccharide complex biopo￾lymer with excellent mechanical strength and the ability to form complex aerogels 
mainly obtained from plants. It is composed of D-glucose units with β-1,4-glucosidic 
linkages. Cellulose-based aerogels mainly fall into three categories: nanofibrillated 
cellulose (NFC) aerogels, cellulose nanocrystal (CNC)aerogels (also known as na￾nowhiskers), and bacterial cellulose (BC) aerogels. The fibrillation process produces 
nanofibrillated cellulose that attains diameters of 5–70 nm. Nanofibril cellulose 
aerogel with pore size ranging from 10–100 nm is also produced using the super￾critical drying method. Cellulose nanocrystals obtained by hydrolysis and mechanical 
treatment reactions are highly crystalline and rigid with high nanowhisker modulus. 
488 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications The production of bacterial cellulose involves complex biochemical synthetic pro￾cedures. The most critical bacterial source for the production of BC aerogel is acet￾obacterxylinum bacterium. Unlike the other two forms of cellulose aerogels, BC 
aerogels have applications mainly in the biomedical field, such as in drug delivery, 
skincare, and wound-healing (Bodin et al. 2011; Khalil et al. 2014; Cherian, Paulose, 
and Vysakh 2018; Blanco et al. 2018; Bhat et al. 2019). 
Starch, the prime storage biopolymer in plants, plays an essential role in cell 
metabolism. It has two independent and interconnected D-glucan biopolymers. One is 
amylose, a relatively linear 1,4-alpha-D-glucan with a small number of long branches. 
The other is amylopectin, mainly a 1,4-alpha-D-glucan containing high-density 
branches. The ratio of amylose and amylopectin in the starch affects aerogel’s mi￾crostructure, thereby influencing the properties. 
Chitin is the second-most abundant natural polysaccharide, composed of re￾peating beta-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine units. These rigid, crystalline linear 
polymers are insoluble in water at neutral pH. Chitin is seen in shells of arthropods, 
such as crabs and shrimps besides insects, fungi, and bacteria (Ziatabar et al. 2018). 
Chitosan is a partially N-deacetylated derivative of chitin. This rigid and 
crystalline heteropolysacchride molecule is composed of D-glucosamine and 
FIGURE 18.1 Polysaccharide-based aerogels and their applications according to the year of 
publication (a) Type of aerogel; (b) applications on different fields (Y. Wang et al. 2019). 
Potential Applications of Polysaccharide-Based Aerogels 489 N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Chitosan is insoluble in water at neutral Ph, but soluble in 
acidic pH due to protonation at the free amino group. The primary natural sources 
of chitosan are arthropods and mushrooms (Ziatabar et al. 2018). Takeshita and 
Yoda (Takeshita and Yoda 2015) have reported that chitosan-based aerogels have a 
more randomly oriented pore structure than cellulose aerogels, which provide ex￾cellent thermal insulation properties. 
Konjacglucomannan is a beta-1,4-glycosidic linked polysaccharide composed of 
D-mannose and D-glucose with a molar ratio of 1.5:1.6:1 with 5%–10% acetyl 
substitution. It can attract multivalent cations and form appropriate cross-linking 
structures due to the presence of free carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. It is reported 
that the addition of gelatin and starch to this polysaccharide skeleton helps in the 
formation of open and closed pores (Jin et al. 2015). 
Pectin is an acidic heteropolysaccharide biopolymer with different degrees of 
esterified residues of galacturonic acid and other carbohydrate moieties. It is clas￾sified as high methoxy pectin and low methoxy pectin based on the degrees of 
pectin esterification. A significant commercial source of pectin is citrus fruits 
(Groult and Budtova 2018a; 2018b). Alginates are metal salts of alginic acid, a 
naturally occurring edible polysaccharide found in brown algae. It has many free 
carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, attracting multivalent metal ions to form a novel 
“egg-shaped” structure (Dekamin et al. 2018). 
Carrageenan is a natural linear sulfated polysaccharide molecule extracted from 
edible red seaweed (Anderson, Dolan, and Rees 1973). 
Chemical modification improves biopolymers’ physical, mechanical, and 
chemical properties to a large extent and helps diversify their applications. Many 
research groups have reported starch-hybrid aerogels with enhanced hardness, 
surface area, anti-fungal properties, and thermal insulation properties and so on 
(Abhari, Madadlou, and Dini 2017). Utilizing grafting and monomethyl mod￾ification, Hasan et al. (Hsan et al. 2019) and El Knidri et al. (El Knidri et al. 2018) 
improved the solubility coagulation of chitosan. Grafting and oxidation of kon￾jacglucomannan enhanced their swelling ability, hydrophobic interaction ability, 
and appropriate water retention capacity. Properties like thermal and pH re￾sponsiveness and hydrophobicity of alginate were boosted by grafting and tar￾geted modifications (J. Wu, Deng, and Lin 2013; Luo et al. 2018). 
18.2.2 METHODS OF PREPARATION 
The main advantage of polymeric aerogels compared to inorganic aerogels is that 
the pore size can be adapted by changing the polymer source and synthetic protocol 
including drying methods. Aerogels with open and closed pore structures can be 
produced from the natural polysaccharides. Open pores interact with neighbouring 
surroundings, whereas closed pores keep them separated from outside. When 
aerogels are used in drug encapsulation, the drug needs to be encapsulated and then 
released; hence, closed pores are used here. In regenerative medicine, open pores 
are used. Thus, the type, quality and size of pores play an essential role in their 
usage. Therefore, it is essential to select a suitable synthetic protocol for their 
production (Rouquerol et al. 1994; Hüsing and Schubert 1998). Drug loading of 
490 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications aerogels during sol-gel process and by supercritical impregnation post-treatment 
method is shown in Figure 18.2. 
After various pre-treatment steps, the biomass gets converted into nanoma￾terial, which will be in a suspension form (J. Liu, Willför, and Xu 2015). Even 
though there are several methods for producing nano aerogels from this sus￾pension (hydrogel), the best routes are supercritical drying and freeze-drying. 
Small pores can be efficiently produced by supercritical drying. The other ad￾vantages are reduced gel shrinkage, higher porosity, and a 3D network of the 
aerogel morphology. It is suitable for large-scale production as it is expensive and 
dangerous. Freeze-drying is simple, sustainable, and economical and suitable for 
large-scale production. The most common solvent for the supercritical drying 
process is carbon dioxide (CO2). Air and vacuum drying processes are also 
possible, but these are rarely used. 
High-temperature supercritical drying and low-temperature supercritical drying 
are the drying options. In high temperature supercritical drying, the water in the 
hydrogel is replaced by an organic solvent and placed in an autoclave. When the 
solvent reaches a supercritical state, it evaporates constantly. In low-temperature 
supercritical drying, the organic solvent is replaced by soluble CO2 as a drying 
medium. In supercritical drying, the original shape of materials is maintained by the 
elimination of capillary pressure (Kistler 1932; S. Liu et al. 2017; Ciftci et al. 2017). 
Freeze-drying is an extensively used method. Gel-sol is frozen in the first step, 
followed by sublimation of ice gel, during which the liquid in the gel is replaced by 
gas to produce a high vacuum. Ice crystal growth process determines the aerogel 
structure. Nucleation and growth of crystals are the two stages in freeze-drying. The 
crystal centre and nucleus are obtained by cooling of solvent to attain a super￾cooling point. This happens in the nucleation step. The growth of crystal takes place 
in the second stage, and both stages share a competing relationship. Under easy 
forming conditions, it will proliferate, condense into blocks, and lessen the chances 
FIGURE 18.2 Drug loading of aerogels: (a) during the sol-gel process (co-gelation); (b) in 
the aerogel matrix by supercritical impregnation post-treatment method ( García-González, 
Alnaief, and Smirnova 2011). 
Potential Applications of Polysaccharide-Based Aerogels 491 of forming small, uniform crystals. If we decrease the temperature, it will result in 
the formation of large ice crystals (Ni et al. 2016; Weiling Wang et al. 2019; El￾Naggar et al. 2020; Ciftci et al. 2017). 
18.3 APPLICATIONS OF POLYSACCHARIDE-BASED AEROGELS 
Given their biodegradability, biocompatibility, renewability, high porosity, low 
density, low toxicity, large surface area, and extremely lightweight and pliable 
nature, polysaccharide-based aerogels have various applications in the biomedical 
field, food industry, aerospace industry, cosmetics production, electronic industry, 
building material industry, and so on. According to a statistical study on the various 
fields of application of polysaccharide-based aerogels by Wang et al. at the be￾ginning of 2019, 30.84% of the aerogels finds application in the environmental 
engineering field, 15.58% in the health and medical fields, 13.4% in the packaging 
field, and 11.21% in the building/construction field. (Y. Wang et al. 2019) The 
following sections of the chapter explain those applications in detail. 
18.3.1 BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS 
18.3.1.1 As Biosensors 
A biosensor is an analytical tool that exclusively detects a biological or a chemical 
component by generating signals proportional to the concentration. When the bio￾sensor interacts with, binds with, or recognizes the analyte under study, it produces a 
biochemical signal, converted into an electronic or optical signal by a transducer. Due 
to biocompatibility, biodegradability, and renewability, polysaccharide-based aero￾gels are extensively used in biosensing applications. Cellulose nanofibril with low 
density derived from cotton is used as a transducer biosensor surface for wound 
healing (Edwards et al. 2016). Consequently, nanofibers’ extensive surface area and 
biocompatibility, bacterial carbon nanofibers incorporated with gold nanoparticles 
have been used to immobilize heme proteins and enzymes. This biosensor also de￾tects hydrogen peroxide even in low concentrations (Wei Wang et al. 2011). 
18.3.1.2 Tissue Engineering and Bone Regeneration 
Tissue engineering is an emerging field of research concerned with improving re￾storation and maintenance rates and repairing damaged tissue. Scientists working in 
this area have engineered entities consisting mainly of scaffolds and biologically 
active molecules. Since polysaccharide-based nanofibers have many “green qualities” 
and diverse physical, mechanical, and biochemical properties, they have been widely 
used in tissue engineering. Highly porous structures of nanofibrillated cellulose 
aerogel microspheres provide large surface areas, low bulk density, and high water 
absorption capacity to support cell growth and differentiation. A bilayer aerogel 
scaffold consisting of cellulose nanofibers and polyvinyl alcohol was fabricated and 
evaluated for potential skin tissue engineering applications. An MTT assay of the 
scaffolds revealed their biocompatibility, and they can be used for skin repair appli￾cations (Subhedar et al. 2021). Tang et al. synthesized a polyethylene glycol diacrylate 
(PEGA) and cellulose nanofibril-based scaffold for tissue engineering applications. 
492 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications Studies have shown that the NIH 3T3 cells tightly adhered to the scaffolds and spread 
over their surface with good differentiation and viability (Tang et al. 2019). Another 
nanocellulose-based aerogel, reported by Liu et al., also showed promising potential 
for tissue-engineering applications. Their degree of swelling and porosity was influ￾enced by charge density, swelling media conditions and processing parameters. In 
vitro MTT assays confirmed these scaffolds’ biocompatibility (J. Liu et al. 2016). 
Fang et al. have reported hydroxyapatite/bacterial cellulose nanocomposite scaffolds 
prepared through a biomimetic procedure, claiming that they have the potential for 
bone-tissue engineering. Their paper investigated the proliferation and osteoblastic 
differentiation of stromal cells derived from human bone marrow on the newly syn￾thesized nanocomposite. The results showed that the cells proliferated faster on the 
nanocomposites than on pure bacterial cellulose (Fang et al. 2009). 
Due to the relatively low cost, biocompatibility, low toxicity, and gelation me￾chanism, alginate aerogels are commonly used in tissue engineering. The drawback 
is the limited adsorption of protein due to their hydrophilic nature leading to in￾hibition of cell adhesion. Mejuto and Gonzalez have reported 3D-printed alginate￾hydroxyapatite (HA) aerogel scaffolds with excellent biological and textural 
properties for bone tissue engineering. They have also prepared the same scaffolds 
using a supercritical drying method. The scaffolds allowed the attachment and 
proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The aerogels tested also enhanced 
the fibroblast migration toward the damaged area, favouring bone regeneration 
(Iglesias-Mejuto and García-González 2021). 
18.3.1.3 Wound Healing 
Optimal oxygen permeability, moisture control, and normal cellular function among 
other factors are required for the wound healing process. Porous biomaterials with 
large surface area and biocompatibility make them good choices for wound healing. 
Chitosan aerogels can accelerate blood clotting and have antibacterial properties. 
Chitosan aerogels loaded with vancomycin are used to treat and prevent infections 
on injuries (Lorenzo and Müller 2008). Duong et al. developed a cotton fiber￾chitosan-based hybrid aerogel to stop bleeding. These scaffolds prevent blood loss 
by counteracting the systolic blood pressure at the injured area (Duong et al. 2018). 
Cellulose-based aerogels are used as a dressing material for wounds because of their 
rigidity, porosity, and nonallergenic nature. Cellulose aerogels produced from ultra￾pure lignocellulosicnanofibers are used for dressing wounds. Sometimes an anti￾bacterial material or plant extracts are incorporated with cellulose nanofibers to 
improve the healing quality of dressing materials (Yahya et al. 2020). 
18.3.1.4 Drug Delivery 
One of the biggest challenges for the pharmaceutical industry is the synthesis of drugs 
that give relevant therapeutic results with the diminutive side effects and the discovery 
of appropriate pathways to deliver optimum doses of these formulations to target organs 
in a time-bound manner. The unique properties of aerogels can be helpful in this if 
properly exploited. The large surface area and open pore structure guarantee their use in 
drug-delivery systems (DDS). High adsorption abilities and low toxicities determine the 
choice of an aerogel as a potential carrier and drug release rates (immediate, prolonged, 
Potential Applications of Polysaccharide-Based Aerogels 493 or controlled release). The release rate of the loaded substances is an important de￾terminant. That is the rate of dissolution of the loaded substance. This is largely 
determined by the specific surface area. The larger the surface area, the faster is the 
dissolution and the more effective is the absorption in the body. With their relatively 
large surface area, aerogels prove their worth in this regard. 
Silica-based aerogels were widely studied because of their high degree of bio￾compatibility. However, their nondegradability is a severe hindrance to their po￾tential application. They are not subject to enzymatic decomposition within the 
body. This problem can be solved by replacing silica-based aerogels with 
polysaccharide-(starch, alginate, chitosan, and so on) based ones characterized by 
higher stability, biodegradability and renewability. 
Biodegradable and biocompatible polysaccharide-based aerogels are a better 
choice for drug-delivery applications than inorganic or carbon-based nanomaterials. 
While selecting and designing a drug-delivery carrier, care must be taken to avoid 
possible side effects and complications at the time of administration. The drug 
release mechanism should be fine-tuned by varying the process parameters during 
the fabrication of carriers (Smirnova 2011). 
Obaidat et al. developed carrageenan-based aerogel microparticles using the 
emulsion-gelation technique to deliver ibuprofen. The main aim of this carrier 
system was to enhance the dissolution velocity of feebly soluble drug molecules 
(Obaidat, Alnaief, and Mashaqbeh 2018). The poor solubility of ketoprofen was 
resolved by loading it in carriers made of starch, pectin, and alginate-based aerogel 
microphores. The drug-releasing mechanism of pectin and alginate microphores 
followed the Gallagher-Corrigan release model, whereas the starch followed first￾order kinetics (García-González et al. 2015). Chitosan and alginate with mu￾coadhesive properties are used for the mucosal delivery of ketoprofen and quercetin 
(Gonçalves et al. 2016). A calcium ion cross-linked hybrid chitosan aerogel was 
developed for the controlled delivery of 5-fluorouracil, an anticancer agent. Here 
the drug-releasing pattern follows Fick’s diffusion model (R. Wang et al. 2017). An 
alginate-g-P (NIPAM-co-NHMAM) temperature and pH-responsive (dual￾responsive) aerogel fabricated by Shao et al. displayed a decent drug-loading ef￾ficiency, up to 13.24% (Shao et al. 2018). The high gelation, stability, and low 
toxicity make pectin a good candidate for fabricating carriers for drug delivery. The 
dissolution velocity of poorly soluble nifedipine drug was enhanced using a high￾methoxyl pectin aerogel (Tkalec, Knez, and Novak 2015). 
For instance, Mehling et al. loaded polysaccharide-based aerogels with ibuprofen 
and paracetamol and identified the direct dependence of drug loading and kinetics 
on specific surface area and pore size, respectively (Mehling et al. 2009). Chitosan￾based polymers synthesized using tolerant acids and propylene glycol as cross￾linking agents are lightweight and appreciably responsive to stimuli; they are 
therefore used as anticancer drugs (Lin, Jia, and Wu 2019). Nevertheless, another 
aerogel synthesized using polyethyleneimine grafted with cellulose nanofibers de￾veloped by Zhao et al. is used as a DDS for sodium salicylate in treating diabetes, 
cancer, arthritis, and so on (Zhao et al. 2017). 
Cryogel composites of nanocellulose/gelatine have successfully been used for 
the controlled release of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (J. Li et al. 2019). The drug-release 
494 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications rate can be carefully tuned by adjusting the NFC/gelation ratio, porosity, density, 
and degree of cross-linking. The delivery of a drug, vanomycin, is easily achievable 
using chitosan-based aerogel carriers, permitting efficient therapeutic action at the 
wound site (López-Iglesias et al. 2019). To prolong the drug-release activity, a core￾shell structure was set up with the core fabricated using amidated pectin and the 
shell using alginate (Horvat et al. 2018). Oral administration of 5-fluorouracil 
(5-FU) was done using an inter-polymer complex of cellulose acetate phthalate 
(CAP) and chitosan (CS) with an extended drug-release time of 12hours. The au￾thors also noted a dependence of drug loading on the compositions of CS and 
CAP, especially at some specific pH values (Thakker et al. 2014). 
18.3.2 FOOD TECHNOLOGY 
The biodegradability, sustainability, renewability, and biocompatibility of poly￾saccharide-based aerogels make them effective in food technology. They are 
suitable for the human diet, pose minimal adverse effects, and penetrate the food 
industry in an eco-friendly way. 
18.3.2.1 Food and Food Supplements 
Aerogels have numerous food-related applications as smart ingredients that control 
the release of nutrients, fat substitutes, intelligent food-packaging materials, etc. 
Their open pore structure enables the incorporation of functionalization that opens 
up possibilities in the food industry by focusing on specific consumer needs. Starch￾based aerogel fabrication has gained considerable interest in recent times, for plenty 
of raw materials are available (Zhu 2019). Microcrystalline or agar-incorporated 
aerogels based on starch, synthesized by Dogenski and co-workers, showed ex￾cellent water stability, mechanical capabilities, and controlled release of active 
materials (Dogenski et al. 2020). Alginate and pectin-based aerogels fabricated 
using bivalent Ca2+ cross-links exhibited 1081 nm pore size, 44.61% water solu￾bility, and improved textural characteristics compared to pure starch-based aerogels 
(K. Chen and Zhang 2019). Catalytic power and mechanical stiffness are further 
aided by the combination of ionic and covalent cross-links (Hou et al. 2020). 
However, another polysaccharide of marine origin is carrageenan, which is effec￾tive as an emulsifier and stabilizer (Tran et al. 2020). Its properties have been 
carefully studied by Agostinho et al. (Agostinho et al. 2020). 
The source largely determines the morphological features of aerogels derived from 
cellulose. For instance, eucalyptus cellulose-based aerogels have a well-arranged 
structure with tiny pores (de Oliveira et al. 2019), while pure cellulose fractions 
(containing no hemicellulose) offer higher density and compactness compared to 
aerogels (Fontes-Candia et al. 2019). In addition, the air-trapping ability (under their 
carefully tunable pore size) causes a higher flavor perception by improving food 
sensory properties. This implies enhanced taste at lower levels of salt use. 
Aerogels are widely used as carriers in delivery systems. The process of loading 
aerogels with the target molecules can be done during any of the two steps of 
aerogel production: wet impregnation or post-drying impregnation. They can pro￾tect sensitive compounds, and entrapping plant extracts in cellulose-based aerogels 
Potential Applications of Polysaccharide-Based Aerogels 495 can attribute antioxidative properties. Also, the bioavailability of nutrients is im￾mensely enhanced in aerogel-protected particles compared to their being adminis￾tered as free ingredients. Another advantage is the ability of an aerogel’s porous 
network to take up oils (the weight of oil trapped might even exceed five times the 
weight of aerogel particles) through capillary forces and thereby act as fat sub￾stitutes for less healthy saturated/trans fats (Mikkonen et al. 2013). Essential oils 
that are natural antimicrobials and antioxidants play an essential role in preventing 
food decay, but if these EOs are released at an exceedingly fast rate, they get 
exhausted way too quickly, and the shelf life of the food is affected. However, 
EHCN-EO and TOCN-EO offer a solution by enabling a sustained release of Eos 
(Z. Zhang et al. 2020). 
18.3.2.2 Food Packaging 
With their highly porous nature and large surface areas, aerogels open up novel 
applications in the field of packaging, as in other applications we have dealt with. 
Mechanical strength can be reinforced using nanoparticles and fibers. Although 
an aerogel is a low density, low molecular weight polymer, the weight it can 
withstand is astonishing. A chitin-based aerogel weighing 60 mg, with a volume of 
approximately 5.6 cm3 withstood, without any considerable deformation, a weight 
of 100 mg. Aerogels can also be made moisture-resistant by repeated mechanical 
milling and freezing processes. This implies that such aerogel-based substances can 
retain their structure even when they contact solutions. Bio-based aerogels are also 
good thermal insulators, with thermal conductivity of less than 0.025 W/mK 
(Manzocco, Mikkonen, and García-González 2021). Hence, they are used in cold 
storage and thermal flasks. Certain aerogels developed can enhance the shelf-life, 
especially fruits and vegetables, by lowering ethylene production and increasing 
resistance to microbes. CO2 levels as low as 5% and O2 levels higher than 8% delay 
foodstuff deterioration, as shown by Huber and Embuscado (Embuscado and Huber 
2009). Further, the use of polluting petroleum derivatives in food packaging can be 
reduced significantly by preventing surface contamination, as shown in studies by 
Tian et al. (Tian and Bilal 2020). 
CNF-CH composite films have been extensively investigated and have reduced 
water-absorption capacity and improved the moisture barrier and antibacterial prop￾erties (Deng, Jung, and Zhao 2017). Cellulose-based aerogels have the astonishing 
film-forming ability (Almasi, Ghanbarzadeh, and Entezami 2010), but their highly 
hydrophilic nature makes them less efficient barriers (Tabari 2017). PCF11 coatings 
increase the shelf life of edibles, especially tomatoes (Deng, Jung, and Zhao 2017). 
The remarkably hydrophilic semi–crystalline starch granules also promise the food￾packaging industry (Pelissari et al. 2019). Pullulan, Gellan, and Xanthan gum are a 
few microbial polysaccharides useful in synthesizing edible films (S. A. A. Mohamed, 
El-Sakhawy, and El-Sakhawy 2020). 
18.3.3 ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY 
Aerogels possess many properties that make them ideal for use in the electronics 
industry. These include exceptionally low thermal conductivity, flame resistance, 
496 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications electrical insulation, low density, and corrosion resistance, to name a few (X.-L. Wu 
and Xu 2014; Ahankari et al. 2021). Therefore, they are used in many electronic 
gadgets including supercapacitors, batteries, and high voltage insulators. 
18.3.3.1 Supercapacitors 
Over the years, there has been a shift in our energy needs to sustainable, en￾vironment friendly, renewable power sources, and storage systems without com￾promising on efficiency. While biofuels, wind energy, and solar energy dominate 
the domain of power sources, lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors rule the 
storage sector because of their high energy density, long life, low thermal con￾ductivity, operational stability, and so on. 
A supercapacitor, also referred to as an ultra capacitor, is an enhanced capacitor 
whose capacitance value overtakes the capacitance value of the other types of ca￾pacitors manifold. Metal-oxide-based supercapacitors have the requisite capacitance 
value and design flexibility, but high production costs. Polymer-based ones like 
PEO and PMMA also are good candidates, but they are nondegradable and thus 
pose threats to organic life. Therefore, researchers have turned their attention to 
biopolymers like chitosan, cellulose, agar,and starch, which adhere to the principles 
of sustainability (M. G. Mohamed et al. 2020). 
Porous nanoplatelets-wrapped carbon aerogels fabricated by bamboo cellulose 
dissolution open a fascinating path in supercapacitor applications (Yang et al. 
2018). Other innovations include conducting polymer-based supercapacitors 
such as nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) doped poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythipohene) 
(PEDOT) (Ravit et al. 2019) and a ternary system composed of carbon nanofibers￾chitosan and cobalt nanoparticles (CNF-CS/Co) (Punde, Karna, and Srivastava 
2019). Cellulose foams may be carbonized to carbon foams for various applications. 
Additionally, pseudoocapacitance can be incorporated into these aerogels and 
carbon foams using heteroatoms (P,N,S) (Ghosh et al. 2020). 
18.3.3.2 For Batteries 
Batteries top the list of energy-storage systems due to their inherent simplicity, 
portability, and efficiency. A battery’s energy storage can be maximized by in￾creasing the cell potential and decreasing the mass of reactant per electron 
exchanged. 
Rechargeable lithium batteries with LiCoO2 as cathode and graphite as anode are 
commonly used. Their capacities can be further enhanced if oxygen is directly used 
as the cathode active material (Li/O2 cell) (Mirzaeian and Hall 2009). However, 
bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) derived carbon-based electrodes can offer better 
efficiency as the enhanced surface area increases the electrode/electrolyte interface 
essential for charge-transfer reactions, and the open 3D network provides a smooth 
path for continuous path. The open 3D network provides a smooth path for the 
continuous path. However, bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) derived carbon-based 
electrodes can offer better efficiency as the enhanced surface area increases the 
electrode/electrolyte interface essential for charge transfer reactions. The open 3D 
network provides a smooth path for continuous electron transport. Moreover, the 
extremely thin nanofibers (diameter approximately 20nm) guarantee the lithium 
Potential Applications of Polysaccharide-Based Aerogels 497 ions’ reduced diffusion distance (L. Wang et al. 2014). Bacterial cellulose (BC) 
derived carbon nanofiber (CNF) decorated with nanoFe3O4 (Y. Wan et al. 2015) 
exhibits improved electrochemical performance. Their highly flexible and porous 
network structure, huge surface area, and excellent reversible capacity together 
make them sought-after electrode materials, especially in lithium-ion batteries. 
Bacterial cellulose-derived (BC) amorphous Fe2O3 coated carbonaceous aerogel 
(Huang et al. 2016) is also synthesized using almost the same combination of raw 
materials. 
The poor ionic conductivity offered by polypropylene(PP) separators is a severe 
drawback to lithium-ion batteries. This could be overcome by enveloping these 
separators with an induced self-assembly of hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC)-based 
aerogel (Liao et al. 2016). Cellulose aerogel membranes (CAMs) are helpful in the 
fabrication of lithium-ion batteries, where they act as a matrix for gel-polymer 
electrolyte (J. Wan et al. 2017). Xiaoming et al. investigated the anchorage of Si 
nanoparticles via hydrogen bonding on 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl 
(TEMPO)-oxidized bacterial cellulose (TOBC) aerogel with an enhanced conduc￾tion network and a rate of 298.6 mAhg–1 at 1.6 Ag–1 (X. Zhou et al. 2019). 
18.3.3.3 For Piezoelectric Devices 
The piezoelectric effect can be thought of as emanating in crystalline substances 
due to electromechanical interaction (between electrical and mechanical states), 
that is, internal mechanical stresses might be generated by applying an electric 
field or vice versa. This implies it is a reversible effect. For instance, a 0.1% 
deformation in the original dimensions of lead zirconate titanate crystals results in 
measurable piezoelectricity. Conversely, a 0.1% deformation can be produced in 
the static dimensions of the crystal mentioned above upon applying an electrical 
field. Piezoelectricnanogenerators are being studied widely as novel sources to 
power portable, wireless, or implantable devices. Piezoelectric ceramics like 
BaTiO3(BT), (K, Na)NbO3, etc. have high piezoelectric coefficients but are ac￾companied by very unpleasant brittleness (Shi et al. 2019). On the other hand, 
polymers like polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) are highly flexible but low pie￾zoelectric coefficients (Bera and Sarkar 2017). This points to a growing interest in 
combining the suitable properties of both to construct flexible high-performance 
piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENG); that is, the synthesis of composites of 
elastomeric polymers with inorganic polymers piezoelectric nanomaterial. 
Additional output enhancement can be realized by coupling PENG with TENG 
(triboelectricnanogenerators), which results in single electrode hybrid generators. 
An example is the use of C/BT aerogel papers to construct high performance 
PENGs, wherein the carbon network enables enhanced loading and homogenous 
distribution of tetragonal BT nanoparticles. Such PENGs can usually generate 
a power of 11.8 μW, which further raised by coupling with TENGs (approx. 
85 μW) (Korkmaz and Kariper 2020). Nevertheless, the use of inorganic and 
synthetic polymers poses several environmental issues. Here comes the role of 
natural polymers in nanogenerators’ fabrication as they help overcome the po￾tential toxicity and non-degradability of inorganic and synthetic polymers. Zheng 
and co-workers developed a cellulose nanofibril (CNF)/polydimethylsiloxane 
498 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications (PDMS)-based nanogenerator with an open-circuit voltage of 60.2 V and a power 
density of 6.3 mW/cm3 (Zheng et al. 2016). It can generate enough power 
to charge a capacitor up to 3.7 V or power 19 blue LEDs. Cellulose (dopant: Au/ 
PDMS), nanocellulose (dopant:BaTiO3) andcalcium-alginate (dopant:BaTiO3) 
are some of the other biopolymer-based aerogels used in this field, with power 
densities of 8.34 mw/m2
, 378.2 nW and 16.14 W/m2 respectively (Shi et al. 
2019). The output performance of cellulose-based triboelectricnanogenerators 
(TENGs) was achieved by adding electronicfunctional fillers trough modification 
of contact surface and chemical modification (Song et al. 2021). A depiction of 
the fabrication process, as well as the SEM images of C/BT, is given in 
Figure 18.3. 
The exploitation of the piezoelectric effect has been in applications such as 
inkjet printing, detection, and production of sound, generation of high voltage 
electricity, as triggers in electronic drums, and so on. Everyday uses include spark 
generation to ignite cooking gas and other heating devices, cigarette lighters, and 
torches. 
18.3.3.4 In High Voltage Insulators 
Polystyrene, mineral wool, and polyurethane were the traditionally used thermal 
insulators due to their high flexibility, resistance to mechanical deformations, etc. 
However, the discovery of silica aerogels with high porosity and low density, ad￾ditionally endowed with extremely low thermal conductivity (λ < 20 mW m-1K-1) 
opened up new possibilities in the field of insulation. Nevertheless, their applica￾tions are limited by poor mechanical strengths and weak interfacial interactions. 
Polysaccharide-based aerogels can exhibit improved gaseous thermal insulation 
if their pore size is less than 70 nm to gaseous exchange molecules. Bleached 
cellulose fiber (BCF)-based aerogels when coated with CNF decreased the pore size 
FIGURE 18.3 Schematic of the fabrication process of a C/BT aerogel paper-based PENG. 
Potential Applications of Polysaccharide-Based Aerogels 499 (6−13 nm), and hence, exhibited a higher gaseous thermal insulation than when 
BCF alone is used, as is evident from the work of Seantier et al. (Seantier et al. 
2016). Hybrid CNF-based aerogels are created by combining them with organic and 
inorganic nanoparticles, and noteworthy is one synthesized by Bendahou et al. 
using nanozeolite particles (Bendahou et al. 2015). Low-density CNF aerogels were 
subjected to compression to reach the Knudsen regime, thereby making super￾insulating CNF (Plappert et al. 2018). However, another method of superinsulator 
synthesis with TEMPO-oxidised CNF using freeze-dried Pickering emulsions was 
illustrated by Jim´enez-Saelices et al. (Jiménez-Saelices et al. 2017). Alginate with 
PET showed a surprisingly reduced surface area of 18 m2
/g and relatively low 
conductivity (Ahmad, Ulker, and Erkey 2018). In 2019, Qi et al. synthesized cotton￾based CNF cryogels with a decrease in conductivity of 0.049–0.028 W corre￾sponding to an increase in porosity from 97.7% to 99.4% (Qi et al. 2019). 
Composite cellulose-based aerogels with very low thermal conductivity of 0.018 W/ 
m⋅K were reported by Wang et al. (D. Wang et al. 2020). Other recent contributions 
include studying the effect of different freeze-drying methods on the thermal 
conductivity of polyimide/bacterial cellulose cryogels, (X. Zhang et al. 2020) metal￾organic cryogel network based on CNF and aluminium, and so on (S. Zhou et al. 
2020). Similarly, hybrid alginate-based aerogels were synthesized by Raman et al. 
(Raman, Gurikov, and Smirnova 2015) and Gurikov et al. (Gurikov et al. 2015) and 
possess super-insulating capacity with conductivity around 0.018–0.022 W/mK. 
Chitosan aerogels with the low value of thermal conductivity [around 0.024–0.025 
W/mK] were obtained by gelling urea with chitosan solutions (Guerrero￾Alburquerque et al. 2020). The assembly of nanorods of carboxylated chitin led to 
the formation of new nanochitin aerogels (PNCAs) with controllable density (10–50 
mg/cm3
) and appreciable mechanical strength, which when silylated offered pro￾mising insulation properties (30.5–35.8 mW/mK) (Yan et al. 2020). The process of 
fabrication of chitin aerogels have been illustrated in Figure 18.4. 
FIGURE 18.4 The fabrication of chitin aerogels. (Reproduced with permission from Yan 
et al., 2020). 
500 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications 18.3.4 IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING 
Possible applications of aerogels include thermal insulation, drug delivery, tissue 
engineering, medical implants, energy/hydrogen storage devices, biosensors, and 
adsorbents for liquids, gases, and some harmful ions. Among these, polysaccharide 
aerogels are promising materials for catalysis and many other engineering applica￾tions due to their high surface area, the absence of diffusional limitations, high 
density, and the convenience of their functional groups (Y. Liu, Liu, and Song 2021). 
Their sources’ reproducibility and reliability allowed the exploitation of biomass￾derived functional polysaccharides in large-scale industrial production processes. 
18.3.4.1 For Catalysis 
Catalytic activity and selectivity of aerogels are influenced by different chemical 
and structural properties of its surface area and pore structure. Polysaccharide 
aerogels can be used as catalyst support. For example, alginate aerogel micro￾spheres are used as catalyst support in the substitution reaction of an allyl car￾bonate with morpholinecatalyzed by the water-soluble Pd (TPPTS)3. Another one 
is the use as bifunctional catalysts, which match the existence of a metal complex 
on the aerogel with the intrinsic functions of the polysaccharide, for example, 
metallophthalocyanine supported on chitosan, which is obtained by the saturation 
of chitosan-aerogel beads with an aqueous solution of a sulfonated metal 
phthalocyanine, followed by drying the solids in supercritical CO2 conditions. 
Polysaccharide aerogels can also be used as organic catalysts. For example, 
chitosan is used as a catalyst for fatty acid addition to glycidol, leading to 
monoglyceride formation (Quignard, Valentin, and Di Renzo 2008; Rauter, 
Vogel, and Queneau 2010). Aerogels-based catalysis has only limited applica￾tions due to the method of preparation, which is expensive. Work is ongoing to 
improve the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of aerogels in the field 
of catalysis. 
18.3.4.2 In Filtration and Separation 
The process of separation of oil and water poses a worldwide challenge, including 
in instances involving industrial oily wastewater and oil spills in oceans. The 
creation of functional aerogels for separation and filtration helps minimize en￾vironmental problems. The aerogel must show super-wetting properties for different 
filtration applications to disintegrate the emulsion. Therefore, it is necessary to 
develop aerogels with specific properties: such as hydrophobic–oleophilic, 
hydrophilic–oleophobic, or omniphobic (Cervin et al. 2012; Y. Wang et al. 2019). 
Aerogels on silane treatment become superhydrophobic and superoleophobic. 
These properties enhance the absorption capability of oils and organic solvents like 
kerosene, nitrobenzene. It can also be used for lampblack filtration. These types of 
aerogels can be fabricated by the freeze-drying method (Fan et al. 2017). Fibre 
aerogels, biomass-derived banana peel/waste paper (BPWP) hybrid aerogels, which 
exhibit superhydrophobicity, superoleophobic wettability, and high porosity can 
effectively separate water-in-oil emulsions (Yue et al. 2018). Twisted carbon fiber 
(TCF), raw cotton, copper (II)-cellulose nanofibers and carbon nanotubes, bamboo 
Potential Applications of Polysaccharide-Based Aerogels 501 fungus tube-like polysaccharide aerogel, protein−polysaccharide conjugate poly￾saccharide aerogels KGM/gelatin/starch/wheat/straw/okara can be used for CO2 
separation, air filtration, as an oil absorbent and so on (Muhammad et al. 2021). 
Alginate-graphene metal oxide (Zhuang et al. 2016) nanoporous chitosan, cross￾linked chitosan aerogel, nanocellulose-polyethyleneimine aerogels and so on can be 
used as water pollutant absorbents. Several studies have been carried out using 
cellulose, chitosan, starch, lignin, alginate, and konjacglucomannan as air-filtration 
material (Muhammad et al. 2021). The filtration performance is assessed by fil￾tration efficiency and filtration resistance. A super hydrophobic cellulose nano￾crystal (CNC) coated cotton fabric was manufactured to separate oil and water, 
with good mechanical properties (Y. Wang et al. 2019). Recently, compressible 
and conducting carbon aerogels (3C) have found wide application thanks to their 
excellent performance on oil-water separation (L. Li et al. 2017). 
Research is ongoing to find new superwetting aerogels and increase the pro￾duction and availability of polysaccharide-based aerogels for efficient filtration 
and separation. 
18.3.4.3 In Green Technology 
Cellulose-based aerogels are environment-friendly, green, biodegradable, and have 
good absorbents. These properties make them well-suited for use in biomedical 
materials, heat insulation, preparation of CA aerogels, and so on. Carbon aerogels 
(CA) constitute a high-performing and unique class of high surface area materials 
having tunable three-dimensional hierarchical morphology and environmental com￾patibility, electrical conductivity, and chemical inertness. These properties hold 
great technological promise in many energy-related applications, including hydrogen 
and electrical energy storage, desalination, catalysis, drug delivery, and aerospace 
applications (Moreno-Castilla and Maldonado-Hódar 2005; Biener et al. 2011). 
Starch-based aerogels are a green alternative for many applications (Zhu 2019). 
Bio-based polymers used in packaging materials are made from bio-based 
resources. Polysaccharides, the most-used raw material, are extracted from plants 
or marine organisms. Polysaccharides are biocompatible, biodegradable, and 
nontoxic toward living organisms, and given these properties, they are used in 
edible coatings and films in food packaging, for example, starch-based aerogels. 
Polysaccharide aerogels prevent bacterial growth in treated wounds, provide a 
clean environment, and have pH-responsive features that make their use in bio￾medical applications and drug-delivery advantageous (Muhammad et al. 2021). 
As a consequence of their biodegradability, biocompatibility, and edibility, re￾searchers are seeking to develop multifunctional bio-based aerogels to minimize 
the use of conventional synthetic ones. 
18.3.5 IN CONSTRUCTION APPLICATIONS 
Aerogels exhibit heat-insulating and load-bearing properties that have popularized 
their use in the construction sector. They can be used for thermal and sound 
insulation, and are fire-resistant. High performance concrete (HPC), ultra-high￾performance concrete (UHPC) and lightweight concrete (LC) are developed from 
502 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications the mixture of aerogel concrete, which combines all the benefits of conventional 
concrete. Starch aerogels have low thermal conductivity, making them suitable for a 
wide range of applications in the construction and pipeline industry (Muhammad 
et al. 2021). Like cellulose-based composite sponges, aerogels are excellent 
thermal-insulating materials used in buildings. Silica-based aerogels are widely 
used in the construction sector (Fickler et al. 2015). 
So far, aerogels have been too costly and mechanically breakable to become 
popular in the construction sector. Nevertheless, of late, many technical changes have 
been enabled in aerogel plasters, endowing them with high mechanical resistance at 
lower costs for construction purposes (Buratti, Moretti, and Belloni 2016). 
18.3.5.1 As Solar Energy Materials 
Aerogel-based catalysts are used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and for solar￾energy storage, as in hydrogen fuel cells, electrolysers, and so on. The early 
aerogels produced by Kistler in 1931 found numerous applications including solar 
energy collectors. However, polysaccharide-based aerogels are less prominent 
as solar energy catalysts given their thermal stability and efficiency properties 
(Y. Wang et al. 2019). 
Bakierska et al. reported starch-based carbon aerogels with high electrical 
conductivity and surface area, suitable for electrochemical applications such as 
energy storage (Hebalkar et al. 2020). Research work is going in applying poly￾saccharide aerogels in solar energy conversion. 
18.3.5.2 In Acoustic Devices 
The application of aerogels in the field of acoustics is high given their intrinsic 
acoustic character and geometric features. Aerogels with open-pore microstructure 
are frequently used in the acoustic designing of buildings and aircraft to help in 
absorbing sound waves (Fernández-Marín et al. 2019). 
Silica/cellulose hybrid aerogels used for acoustic insulation by Feng et al. had 
sound absorption coefficients of around 0.39–0.50 at 10 mm thickness (Feng et al. 
2016). Aerogel-coated nonwoven fabrics have a higher absorption coefficient, 
making them highly suitable for acoustic roles in buildings and automobiles 
(Venkataraman et al. 2014). Biomass (wheat straw, gum, gelatin) aerogels with an 
efficiency level of 0.35 can be used for sound absorption (Y. Wang et al. 2020). 
Monolithic silica aerogels, as well as granular silica aerogels, can be used for 
acoustic purposes. Granular aerogels have advantages over monolithic aerogels in 
acoustics due to their macroporosity, lower elastic constants, low cost, and com￾mercial availability (Gibiat et al. 1995). In acoustics, aerogels are used as 
impedance-matching material in developing efficient ultrasonic devices (Forest, 
Gibiat, and Hooley 2001). 
18.3.5.3 As Thermal Insulators 
A thermal insulator should be lightweight, strong, water-resistant, and so on. Bio￾based aerogels with thermoconductivity values below that of air (25–26 mWm–1 K–1) 
have been synthesized from source materials such as pectin and cellulose. For 
polysaccharide aerogels, the thermal conductivity depends on the sort of 
Potential Applications of Polysaccharide-Based Aerogels 503 polysaccharide used, the processing conditions, and pore size and additives’ presence. 
The pore size highly influences the heat-transfer mechanism. By decreasing density 
and increasing porosity, we can increase the thermal conductivity of aerogels. 
Starch’s low thermal conductivity thermal conductivity value is linked to its pore size, 
which is lower than the mean free path of air molecules (Muhammad et al. 2021). 
Polysaccharide aerogels have low thermal conductivity (16–22 mW/mK), close 
to silica aerogels and some synthetic polystyrene foams. Chitosan with its low 
thermal conductivity is suitable for use as a thermal insulator. Ultralight aerogels 
have a uniform three-dimensional microstructure and are highly porous with tun￾able density. It can be prepared from renewable nanochitin through acid-induced 
gelation, supercritical drying, and silylation. Nanochitin is a lightweight and high￾strength material with 40–150 Gpa modulus (Muhammad et al. 2021). Starch 
aerogels have thermal conductivity comparable to pectin aerogels and lower than 
cellulose-based aerogels (Druel et al. 2017). 
NASA’s Kennedy Space Center and Glenn Research Center have worked on the 
thermal insulation properties of aerogels to be applied in the space industry, parti￾cularly in spacesuits and space radiators. The biodegradable konjacglucomannan 
(KGM)/starch-based aerogels made with wheat straw showed significant thermal in￾sulation and mechanical properties. The nanofibrillated cellulose aerogel developed by 
Gupta et al. based on the pinewood cell wall is used for thermal insulation applications 
(Gupta et al. 2018). Aerogels can also be used as fire-resistant materials. For example, 
melamine-formaldehyde-pectin aerogels invented by Chen et al. have good thermal 
conductivity (H. B. Chen et al. 2019). Wood cellulose aerogels and cellulose/chitosan 
aerogels can be used in thermal insulation. Cellulose-based composite sponge aerogels 
are excellent thermal insulation properties (Y. Wang et al. 2019). 
Research and studies are ongoing to fabricate environment-friendly, strong, ro￾bust, efficient, and high-performance thermal insulators. 
18.3.5.4 As Lightweight Materials 
About 99% of aerogels consist of air, which makes them some of the lightest 
materials on earth. They have only 1%–15% of solid material with a high specific 
surface area, low thermal conductivity, good strength, and dimensional stability. 
Epoxy cross-linked aerogels are more elastic and retain high porosity, producing 
strong but lightweight materials. Lyocell technology is one method used to 
produce ultra-light solid aerogels. Shaped ultralight aerogels can be prepared 
from bacterial cellulose (G.xylinum) in two steps, comprising solvent exchange 
and scCO2 drying. The ultra lightweight nature of aerogels due to their micro￾porous structure has made them useful in medical applications, drug-delivery, 
cosmetics formulation, food packaging, etc. (García-González, Alnaief, and 
Smirnova 2011). Numerous methods are emerging to make lightweight aerogel 
materials by means of chemical and biological processes. 
18.4 SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK 
Polysaccharide-based aerogels have widespread applications in the pharmaceu￾ticals, packaging, environmental engineering, electrochemistry, etc. It has special 
504 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications properties, such as high porosity, low density, nontoxicity, and biodegradability. 
The production of bio aerogels involves the isolation of polysaccharides from the 
raw material and its modification, preparation of hydrogel, and dehydration by 
drying methods like supercritical fluid or freeze-drying. Polysaccharide-based 
biopolymers such as cellulose, starch, chitin, chitosan and alginate serve as the 
base materials for the production of nano aerogels. Since it is a porous material, the 
size and shape of pores play essential roles in their applications. Techniques used 
for raw material preparation, gel, and drying vary for aerogels with different pore 
structures. Even the source of polysaccharide biopolymer plays a role in governing 
the shape and size of pores. It is noted that supercritical drying produces pores 
mainly in the nano scale. 
Many advances are foreseen in developing and applying polysaccharide multi￾functional materials in the food-packaging sector. Research activity and published 
papers on the topic have been steadily growing since 2011. The targets are to in￾crease aerogels’ hydrophobicity, and to use natural agricultural waste as raw ma￾terial in their production. Steps are needed to improve their performance, enable 
mass production in industry, ensure applications in broader fields, and design dif￾ferent shapes and sizes to meet requirements (Y. Wang et al. 2019). Advances are 
needed to improve their properties in industrial applications and as a substitute for 
available silica aerogels.

Green nanomaterials adhere well to the new norms of giving impetus to the 
sustainability factor. Theoretical research developing and testing new green na￾nomaterials is currently being carried out. The good thing is that nanotechnology 
research is focusing on the betterment of their application methods. Even though 
the research is progressive at the laboratory scale, soon it will reach a new high, 
where this technology will be applied to commercial-scale production. 
Researchers have searched for the possibility of utilizing green nanomaterials that 
encompass a vast and diversified range of industries. Packaging industries, energy 
conservation/conversion, water, and gas purification are the most prominent 
among them. 
DOI: 10.1201/9781003245261-22 515 19.1 PACKAGING 
Researchers have been constantly investigating active packaging materials in various 
biodegradable polymer matrices derived from natural and synthetic sources as they 
are environmentally friendly and durable during service. Since nanomaterials have 
high surface-to-volume ratios, the resultant nanocomposite can improve the perfor￾mance of fresh food packaging in terms of shelf life. To impart antimicrobial, anti￾bacterial, and antioxidant properties in food-packaged material, nanocomposites have 
been progressively employed, illustrating its importance in the years to come. 
Literature shows that nanoparticles must disperse well and be distributed uniformly in 
polymer matrices to enhance these aforementioned properties. Additionally, it should 
enhance the interfacial interactions and adhesion between the phases to improve the 
aforementioned active properties (Carvalho and Conte Junior 2020). The primary 
nanomaterials that have displayed improved antimicrobial and antioxidant abilities of 
the packaged film are graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, chitosan. Zinc oxide (ZnO), 
silver and selenium nanoparticles (AgNPs, SeNPs) are also ideal fillers as they have 
strong antimicrobial and antioxidant properties (Kim et al. 2020; Ndwandwe et al. 
2021). However, limited research has been carried out on plant-mediated synthesis of 
SeNPs-based active packaging (Xiong Chang et al. 2021). 
There are also safety concerns regarding nanoparticles incorporated into active 
packaging due to the possibility of them diffusing into food and causing human 
toxicological consequences (Jovic 2017). The migration of nano-particles to food 
products to investigate the possibilities of undesirable or harmful ingredients is still 
not conclusive and will be an emergent area to explore (Gallocchio, Belluco, and 
Ricci 2015; Souza and Fernando 2016). Policies for each country regarding the use 
of green nano film for food packaging are different. This is due to this lack of clarity 
in the toxicity of green nano materials while using it for food packaging (Faghih 
Akhlaghi, Daeihamed, and Jafari 2021). Therefore, nanoparticles-based packaging 
should be studied in greater depth to understand its effect on the human body. 
19.2 ENERGY CONVERSION/CONSERVATION 
Green nanotechnology research is picking up the pace in developing components 
for better power generation, energy storage, and energy absorption. Components 
such as batteries, supercapacitors, solar cells, and fuel cells can be made smaller and 
more efficient; at the same time, this technology can also improve efficiency. The 
management of waste generation reduces global warming by reducing CO2 emis￾sions and brings economic benefits by increasing productivity. The risks associated 
with the use of new green nanotechnology must be weighed against those associated 
with current technologies. Moreover, the human and environmental costs of not 
addressing these challenges should also be considered (Kawamoto, He, and Ito 
2017; Mondal, Anweshan, and Purkait 2020; Muhammad et al. 2021). 
In energy storage, the scope of commercial applications employing green na￾nomaterials is abundant. At the industrial level, thick electrode design with high 
mass loading is a promising direction to further improve the energy density on 
a device level (Wang et al. 2021). Another advancement in the near future is 
516 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications “pore engineering,” which can promote ion conductivity and maximize the ion 
storage capacity (Hsiao and Lin 2021). In addition, given the relatively high cost of 
green nanomaterials produced by state-of-the-art manufacturing techniques, new 
manufacturing techniques with both large scalability, and low cost are in urgent 
need for practical application. Advanced integration techniques, especially enabled 
by stable and highly conductive solid-state electrolyte, are desirable for 
nanocellulose-based integrated, flexible, and high-safety electronic applications. 
However, there is huge potential to develop new green battery components due to 
their rich structural diversity and great possibilities for structural alteration. As of 
now, the field of green electrolytes is still an underexplored area, where synthetic 
polysaccharide chemists, composite engineers and electrochemists can work to￾gether to design more sustainable battery components (Chen and Hu 2018). 
Flexible electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices are another latest trend, 
and a lot of progress has occurred at the laboratory level. It can be industrially 
manufactured using green nanomaterials, but the lack of feasible techniques 
available now is a concern. For example, consider the fabrication of nanocellulose￾based composites for EES; the fabrication is complicated and time consuming. Only 
very few strategies like direct blending and in-situ polymerization are successfully 
attempted for fabricating green nanofillers with different kinds of active materials. 
Among that too, some limitations of low efficiency, sophisticated process etc. also 
exist along with the high time consumption. Intensive research is still needed in this 
area to make it a success in the commercial scale. Improving the mechanical 
strength and durability is another factor to be worked upon. Further, understanding 
the molecular interaction between green nanoparticles, active compounds that are 
added and surface engineering relating to the porous structure are paramount and 
needs to be worked upon (Xu et al. 2021). 
Nanocellulose (NC) is a promising material for use in biogas separation process 
that facilitates the separation of CO2 from bio-methane (CH4). With improvements 
in the performance of NC-based membranes in biogas separation, it is expected in 
the near future that the dominance of membrane technology will outdate the con￾ventional absorption and adsorption processes. But currently, the efficiency of 
separation and shelf life of such membranes has hardly verified at mass level as the 
conventional processes have. 
19.3 WATER TREATMENT/PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY 
It is essential to have a drinking water systems capable of eliminating micro-pollutants. 
Hence, novel advanced water-treatment technologies are needed. Membrane tech￾nology has an edge over other conventional technologies. Nanocomposite membranes 
are able to integrate various properties, leading to multifunctional systems. It can both 
retain nano-particles and eliminate contaminants. Due to their high specific surface 
area, these membranes also offer higher decontamination efficiency. 
Biogenic approaches that exploit micro-organisms, algae, plant polyphenols, etc. 
have great potential because of the inherent greenness and sustainability of the 
production techniques, as well as their excellent efficiency in minimizing en￾vironmental contaminants. The chemical industry has been under pressure to avoid 
Future Outlook and Challenges 517 toxic and harmful solvents and use biomolecules from organisms in place of toxic 
reagents/chemicals to produce biocompatible nanomaterials. Nanomaterials pre￾pared from biological resources can adsorb contaminants from aqueous waterways 
or catalyze the degradation of organic pollutants into nontoxic compounds. 
Biogenic nanomaterials could be crucial in decontaminating drinking and industrial 
wastewaters due to their sustainable, energy-efficient, relatively inexpensive, and 
ecologically reliable nature (Gautam et al. 2019; Nasrollahzadeh et al. 2021). 
The fundamental technical restriction of nano-engineered water technologies is 
that they are seldom adaptable for large-scale procedures and are currently not 
competitive with traditional treatment methods in many circumstances. A thorough 
clarity on the issues of economic viability of production of such green nanoma￾terials, their interactions with micro-pollutants in water treatment systems, their 
possible toxicity to human health, and their life-cycle consideration is very much 
required for this to happen. The advancement of improved analytical and imaging 
technologies has opened up new avenues for the assessment and measurement of 
nanosized particles, particularly in water-treatment applications (Nasrollahzadeh 
et al. 2021). In short, nano-engineered materials that are safer and earth-abundant 
can provide significant improvements in decentralized water-treatment systems and 
point-of-use devices. 
19.4 SCOPE FOR INDUSTRIALIZATION 
The aforementioned packaging, water treatment, and energy domains have high￾lighted the respective technical difficulties in the go-ahead for mass-scale in￾dustrialization. One more common technical hurdle is the making of nano-composite 
material/film/aerogel at the industrial scale. In processing methods like extrusion-film 
casting and injection molding, the chances of agglomeration of nano-particles are 
more likely if traditional screws are employed. Recent innovation in manufacturing 
employ nano blades/screws for its use in extrusion and injection molding (Parmar, 
Patel, and Bhatia 2021). This improvisation in the screws helps in the dispersion 
of nano particles, which improves the quality of the product. 
Apart from the technical aspects, other major aspects to be considered while 
implementing in industries include financial, regulatory, and organizational aspects 
(Matus et al. 2012; Vinayan, Nagar, and Ramaprabhu 2013). Most of the con￾ventional enterprises in these areas are highly capital intensive, and so these firms 
will be reluctant to abandon their previous investments in machineries and infra￾structure to pave a way for new technology. United Nations (UN) and International 
Monetary Funds (IMF) are offering incentives to manufacturers to support green 
nano/technology, which can help developing nations. With this economic support, 
the manufacturers can change from conventional sources to green nano/technology. 
Strict national government rules and regulations could also offer an effective boost 
to the development and commercialization of green nanotechnologies. 
The fundamental feature of green nanotechnology is the synthesis of eco-friendly 
materials and the use of eco-friendly chemical processes. Green chemistry princi￾ples can be applied to green methods of processes and nanoproducts, but the actual 
implementation is relatively low (Shaheen et al. 2020). At the current state of 
518 Nanomaterials from Renewable Resources for Emerging Applications globalization, it looks like the green technology is at the early stages of the tran￾sition. There should be a collaboration of manufacturing companies, academic re￾searchers, industry leaders, and Government and policy makers so that a successful 
movement of green technologies from the laboratory to industries can be facilitated.
