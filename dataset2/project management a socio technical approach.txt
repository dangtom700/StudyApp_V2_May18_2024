Our motivation in writing this text continues to be to provide a realistic, socio-technical 
view of project management. In the past, textbooks on project management focused 
almost exclusively on the tools and processes used to manage projects and not the human 
dimension. This baffled us, since people, not tools, complete projects! While we firmly 
believe that mastering tools and processes is essential to successful project management, 
we also believe that the effectiveness of these tools and methods is shaped and determined 
by the prevailing culture of the organization and interpersonal dynamics of the people 
involved. Thus, we try to provide a holistic view that focuses on both the technical and 
social dimensions and how they interact to determine the fate of projects.
Audience
This text is written for a wide audience. It covers concepts and skills that are used by 
managers to propose, plan, budget, manage and lead project teams to successful comple￾tions of their projects. The text should prove useful to students and prospective project 
managers in helping them understand why organizations have developed a formal project 
management process to gain a competitive advantage. Readers will find the concepts and 
techniques discussed in enough detail to be immediately useful in new-project situations. 
Practicing project managers will find the text to be a valuable guide and reference when 
dealing with typical problems that arise in the course of a project. Managers will also find 
the text useful in understanding the role of projects in the missions of their organizations. 
Analysts will find the text useful in helping to explain the data needed for project imple￾mentation as well as the operations of inherited or purchased software.
Members of the Project Management Institute will find the text is well structured to 
meet the needs of those wishing to prepare for PMP (Project Management Professional) 
or CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management) certification exams. The text 
has in-depth coverage of the most critical topics found in PMI’s Project Management 
Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) and its supplement guidebook, Process Groups: A 
Practice Guide. People at all levels in the organization assigned to work on projects 
will find the text useful not only in providing them with a rationale for the use of proj￾ect management processes but also because of the insights they will gain into how to 
enhance their contributions to project success.
Our emphasis is not only on how the management process works but also, and more 
importantly, on why it works. The concepts, principles, and techniques are univer￾sally applicable. That is, the text does not specialize by industry type or project scope. 
Instead, the text is written for the individual who will be required to manage a variety 
of projects in a variety of organizational settings. In the case of some small projects, 
a few of the steps of the techniques can be omitted, but the conceptual framework 
applies to all organizations in which projects are important to survival. The approach 
can be used in pure project organizations such as construction, research organizations, 
and engineering consultancy firms. At the same time, this approach will benefit orga￾nizations that carry out many small projects while the daily effort of delivering prod￾ucts or services continues.

Content
In this and other editions, we continue to try to resist the forces that engender scope 
creep and focus only on essential tools and concepts that are being used in the real 
world. We have been guided by feedback from reviewers, practitioners, teachers, and 
students. Some changes are minor and incremental, designed to clarify and reduce con￾fusion. Other changes are significant. They represent new developments in the field 
or better ways of teaching project management principles. Below are major changes to 
the ninth edition (2024 Release).
∙ The title of the text has been changed to Project Management: A Socio-Technical 
Approach. This more accurately captures the emphasis not only on the techniques 
associated with project management but also on what ultimately determines 
success—people and how they use these techniques to complete projects. All 
material has been reviewed and revised based on the latest edition of Project 
Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), Seventh Edition, 2020. Note that the 
newest edition represents a major shift in PMBOK toward focusing not only on 
terms and processes but also behavioral issues associated with managing projects. 
This has been the focus of this text from the beginning.
∙ The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on project execution is discussed throughout 
the text.
∙ Some of the Snapshots from Practice have been expanded to more fully cover the 
examples.
∙ New student exercises and cases have been added to chapters.
∙ The Snapshot from Practice boxes feature a number of new examples of project 
management in action.
∙ The Instructor’s Manual contains a listing of current YouTube videos that corre￾spond to key concepts and Snapshots from Practice.
Overall the text addresses the major questions and challenges the authors have 
encountered over their 80 combined years of teaching project management and con￾sulting with practicing project managers in domestic and foreign environments. These 
questions include the following: How should projects be prioritized? What factors con￾tribute to project failure or success? How do project managers orchestrate the complex 
network of relationships involving vendors, subcontractors, project team members, 
senior management, functional managers, and customers that affect project success? 
What project management system can be set up to gain some measure of control? How 
are projects managed when the customers are not sure what they want? How do project 
managers work with people from foreign cultures?
Project managers must deal with all these concerns to be effective. All of these 
issues and problems represent linkages to a socio-technical project management per￾spective. This text focuses not only project management methodology but also on the 
behavioral skills and cultural awareness necessary to be successful. The chapter con￾tent of the text has been placed within an overall framework that integrates these topics 
in a holistic manner. Cases and snapshots are included from the experiences of prac￾ticing managers. The future for project managers is exciting. Careers will be built on 
successfully managing projects.
Student Learning Aids
Student resources include study outlines, online quizzes, PowerPoint slides, videos, 
Microsoft Project Video Tutorials, and web links. These can be found in Connect.

2.1 Why Project Managers Need to Understand Strategy
Project management historically has been preoccupied solely with the planning and 
execution of projects. Strategy was considered to be under the purview of senior man￾agement. This is old-school thinking. New-school thinking recognizes that project 
management is at the apex of strategy and operations. Shenhar speaks to this issue 
when he states, “It is time to expand the traditional role of the project manager from an 
operational to a more strategic perspective. In the modern evolving organization, proj￾ect managers will be focused on business aspects, and their role will expand from get￾ting the job done to achieving the business results and winning in the marketplace.”1
There are two main reasons project managers need to understand their organiza￾tion’s mission and strategy. The first reason is so they can make appropriate decisions 
and adjustments. For example, how a project manager would respond to a sugges￾tion to modify the design of a product to enhance performance will vary depending 
upon whether his/her company strives to be a product leader through innovation or 
to achieve operational excellence through low-cost solutions. Similarly, how a proj￾ect manager would respond to delays may vary depending upon strategic concerns. 
A project manager will authorize overtime if his/her firm places a premium on getting to 
the market first. Another project manager will accept the delay if speed is not essential.
The second reason project managers need to understand the strategic implications of 
their project is so they can be effective project advocates. Project managers have to be 
able to demonstrate to senior management how their project contributes to their firm’s 
mission in order to garner their continued support. Project managers need to be able to 
explain to stakeholders why certain project objectives and priorities are critical in order 
to secure buy-in on contentious trade-off decisions. Finally, project managers need to be 
able to redirect teams efforts when they drift off course. Being able to explain why a sug￾gestion or course of action is not appropriate in terms of strategic objectives will go along 
way in building support within the team (Brown, Hyer, & Ettenson, 2013).
For these reasons, project managers will find it valuable to have a solid understand￾ing of strategic management and project selection processes, which are discussed next.
2.2 The Strategic Management Process: An Overview
Strategic management is the process of assessing “what we are” and deciding and imple￾menting “what we intend to be and how we are going to get there.” Strategy describes how 
an organization intends to compete with the resources available in the existing and per￾ceived future environment. Two major dimensions of strategic management are respond￾ing to changes in the external environment and allocating the firm’s scarce resources 
to improve its competitive position. Constant scanning of the external environment for 
changes is a major requirement for survival in a dynamic competitive environment. The 
second dimension is the internal responses to new action programs aimed at enhancing 
the competitive position of the firm. The nature of the responses depends on the type of 
business, environment volatility, competition, and the organizational culture.
Strategic management provides the theme and focus of the future direction of the 
organization. It supports consistency of action at every level of the organization. 
It encourages integration because effort and resources are committed to common 
goals and strategies. Strategic management is a continuous, iterative process aimed 
at developing an integrated and coordinated long-term plan of action. Objectives 
Explain why it is impor￾tant for project manag￾ers to understand their 
organization’s strategy.

Finally, this model applies the management weights to each criterion by impor￾tance using a value of 1 to 3. For example, ROI and strategic fit have a weight of 
3, while urgency and core competencies have weights of 2. Applying the weight to 
each criterion, the priority team derives the weighted total points for each project. 
For example, project 5 has the highest value of 102 [(2 × 1) + (3 × 10) + (2 × 5) + 
(2.5 × 10) + (1 × 0) + (1 × 8) + (3 × 9) = 102] and project 2 has a low value of 27. If 
the resources available create a cutoff threshold of 50 points, the priority team would 
eliminate projects 2 and 4. Project 5 would receive first priority, project n second, 
and so on. In rare cases where resources are severely limited and project proposals 
are similar in weighted rank, it is prudent to pick the project placing less demand on 
resources. Weighted multi-criteria models similar to this one are rapidly becoming the 
dominant choice for prioritizing projects.
In May 2007, Frontier Airlines Holdings 
hired Gerry Coady as chief informa￾tion officer (CIO). Nearly a year later 
the airline filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 11. In an interview, Coady 
describes how he managed IT projects during the 
bankruptcy and recession crisis of 2008–2009.
Fundamentally, Coady faced a situation of too 
many projects and too few resources. Coady used a 
strategy of focusing on reducing the number of proj￾ects in the portfolio. He put together a steering com￾mittee of senior management that reviewed several 
hundred projects. The end result was a reduction to 
less than 30 projects remaining in the portfolio.
HOW CAN YOU GET TO A BACKLOG OF 
OVER 100 PROJECTS?
“There are never enough resources to get everything 
done.” Backlogs build over time. Sacred cow projects 
get included in the selection system. Projects proposed 
from people who have left the airline still reside in the 
project portfolio. Non-value-added projects somehow 
make their way into the project portfolio. Soon the 
queue gets longer. With everyone in IT working on too 
many projects concurrently, project completion and 
productivity are slow.
WHICH PROJECTS REMAIN?
To cut the number of projects, the steering committee 
used a weighting scheme that reflected the airline’s 
priorities, which were fly safe, generate revenue, 
reduce costs, and customer service. The weighting 
scheme easily weeded out the fluff. Coady noted that 
“by the time you get to the 20s the margin of differen￾tiation gets narrower and narrower.” Of the remaining 
projects, project sponsors had to have solid justifica￾tion why their project was important. Reduction of the 
number of projects placed emphasis on high-value 
projects.
WHAT ADVICE DOES COADY HAVE FOR 
CRISIS MANAGEMENT?
In times of crisis, it is easier to take bold steps to make 
changes. But you need to have a clear vision of what 
you should be focusing on with the resources avail￾able. Coady suggests, “It comes back to really having a 
good idea of what the initial business case for a project 
is and what resources it is consuming, both people and 
otherwise.”

You will find the content of this text highly practical, relevant, and current. The concepts 
discussed are relatively simple and intuitive. As you study each chapter we suggest you 
try to grasp not only how things work but also why things work. You are encouraged to 
use the text as a handbook as you move through the three levels of competency:
I know.
I can do.
I can adapt to new situations.
The field of project management is growing in importance and at an exponen￾tial rate. It is nearly impossible to imagine a future management career that does 
not include management of projects. Resumes of managers will soon be primarily a 
description of their participation in and contributions to projects.
Good luck on your journey through the text and on your future projects.

All of humankind’s greatest accomplishments—from building the great 
pyramids to discovering a cure for polio to putting a footprint on the 
moon—began as a project.
Ever since the first edition, we have opened our text with the line: “This is a 
good time to be reading a book about project management.” This is more true 
today than ever before. Business leaders and experts have recognized that project 
management is critical to sustainable economic growth. New jobs and competi￾tive advantage are achieved by constant innovation, developing new products and 
services, and improving both productivity and quality of work. This is the world 
of project management. Project management provides people with a powerful set 
of tools that improves their ability to plan, implement, and manage activities to 
accomplish specific objectives. But project management is more than just a set of 
tools; it is a contact sport that requires building collaborative relationships among 
a diverse cast of stakeholders. Exciting opportunities await people skilled in proj￾ect management.
The project approach has long been the style of doing business in the construc￾tion industry, U.S. Department of Defense contracts, and Hollywood, as well as big 
consulting firms. Now, project management has spread to all avenues of work. Today, 
project teams carry out everything from port expansions to hospital restructuring to 
upgrading information systems. They are creating next-generation fuel-efficient vehi￾cles, developing sustainable sources of energy, and exploring the farthest reaches of 
outer space. The impact of project management is most profound in high-tech indus￾tries, where the new folk heroes are young professionals whose Herculean efforts lead 
to the constant flow of new hardware and software products.
Project management is not limited to the private sector. Project management is also 
a vehicle for doing good deeds and solving social problems. Endeavors such as provid￾ing emergency aid to areas hit by natural disasters, devising a strategy for reducing 
crime and drug abuse within a city, or organizing a community effort to renovate a

public playground would and do benefit from the application of modern project man￾agement techniques.
Perhaps the best indicator of demand for project management can be seen in the 
rapid expansion of the Project Management Institute (PMI), a professional organiza￾tion for project managers. PMI membership has grown from 93,000 in 2002 to more 
than 686,000 in 2021. See Snapshot from Practice 1.1: The Project Management Insti￾tute for information regarding professional certification in project management.
It’s nearly impossible to pick up a newspaper or business periodical and not find 
something about projects. This is no surprise! Approximately $2.5 trillion (about 
25 percent of the U.S. gross national product) is spent on projects each year in the 
United States alone. Other countries are increasingly spending more on projects. Mil￾lions of people around the world consider project management the major task in their 
profession.
Many people who excel at managing projects never have the title of project manager. 
They include accountants, lawyers, administrators, scientists, contractors, coaches, 
public health officials, teachers, and community advocates whose success depends 
upon being able to lead and manage project work. For some, the very nature of their 
work is project driven. Projects may be cases for lawyers, audits for accountants, events 
for artists, and renovations for contractors. For others, projects may be a small but 
The Project Management Institute 
(PMI) was founded in 1969 as an 
international society for project man￾agers. Today, PMI has members from 
more than 200 countries/territories 
and more than 686,000 members. PMI profession￾als come from virtually every major industry, includ￾ing aerospace, automotive, business management, 
construction, engineering, financial services, informa￾tion technology, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, and 
telecommunications.
PMI provides certification as a Project Manage￾ment Professional (PMP)—someone who has docu￾mented sufficient project experience, agreed to follow 
the PMI code of professional conduct, and demon￾strated mastery of the field of project management by 
passing a comprehensive examination based on the 
Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), 
which is in its 6th edition. The number of people earn￾ing PMP status has grown dramatically in recent years. 
In 1996, there were fewer than 3,000 certified Project 
Management Professionals. By 2023, more than 1.3 
million people have passed the PMP exam. 
Just as the CPA exam is a standard for accountants, 
passing the PMP exam may become the standard for 
project managers. Some companies are requiring that 
all their project managers be PMP certified. Moreover, 
many job postings are restricted to PMPs. Job seekers, 
in general, are finding that being PMP certified is an 
advantage in the marketplace.
PMI added a certification as a Certified Associate 
in Project Management (CAPM). CAPM is designed 
for project team members and entry-level project man￾agers, as well as qualified undergraduate and graduate 
students who want a credential to recognize their mas￾tery of the project management body of knowledge. 
CAPM does not require the extensive project manage￾ment experience associated with the PMP. In fact, stu￾dents often qualify for taking the CAPM exam by taking 
a course on project management. For more details on 
PMP and CAPM, google PMI to find the current website 
for the Project Management Institute.
This text provides a solid foundation for passing 
either exam. However, we personally found it neces￾sary to study a good PMP/CAPM exam “prep book” to 
pass the exam. This is recommended, given the format 
and nature of the exam. Project management is not a 
multiple choice profession.

critical part of their work. For example, a high school teacher who teaches four classes 
a day is responsible for coaching a group of students to compete in a national debate 
competition. A store manager who oversees daily operations is charged with develop￾ing an employee retention program. A sales account executive is given the additional 
assignment of team lead to launch daily deals into a new city. A public health official 
who manages a clinic is also responsible for organizing a Homeless Youth Connect 
event. For these and others, project management is not a title but a critical job require￾ment. It is hard to think of a profession or a career path that would not benefit from 
being good at managing projects.
Not only is project management critical to most careers, but also the skill set is 
transferable across most businesses and professions. Project management fundamen￾tals are universal. The same project management methodology that is used to develop 
a new product can be adapted to create new services, organize events, refurbish aging 
operations, and so forth. In a world where it is estimated that each person is likely 
to experience three to four career changes, managing projects is a talent worthy of 
development.
The significance of project management can also be seen in the classroom. Twenty 
years ago, major universities offered one or two classes in project management, pri￾marily for engineers. Today, most universities offer multiple sections of project man￾agement classes, with the core group of engineers being supplemented by business 
students majoring in marketing, management information systems (MIS), and finance,

as well as students from other disciplines such as oceanography, health sciences, com￾puter sciences, and liberal arts. These students are finding that their exposure to project 
management is providing them with distinct advantages when it comes time to look 
for jobs. More and more employers are looking for graduates with project management 
skills. See Snapshot from Practice 1.2: A Dozen Examples of Projects Given to Recent 
College Graduates for examples of projects given to recent college graduates. The 
logical starting point for developing these skills is understanding the uniqueness of a 
project and of project managers.

Like most organizational efforts, the major goal of a project is to satisfy a cus￾tomer’s need. Beyond this fundamental similarity, the characteristics of a project help 
differentiate it from other endeavors of the organization. The major characteristics of 
a project are as follows:
1. An established objective.
2. A defined lifespan with a beginning and an end.
3. Usually, the involvement of several departments and professionals.
4. Typically, doing something that has never been done before.
5. Specific time, cost, and performance requirements.
First, projects have a defined objective—whether it is constructing a 12-story apart￾ment complex by January 1 or releasing version 2.0 of a specific software package as 
quickly as possible. This singular purpose is often lacking in daily organizational life 
in which workers perform repetitive operations each day.
Second, because there is a specified objective, projects have a defined endpoint, 
which is contrary to the ongoing duties and responsibilities of traditional jobs. Instead 
of staying in one job, individuals often move from project to project, working with dif￾ferent groups of people. For example, after helping to install a security system, an IT 
engineer may be assigned to develop a database for a different client.
Third, unlike much organizational work that is segmented according to functional 
specialty, projects typically require the combined efforts of a variety of specialists. 
Instead of working in separate offices under separate managers, project participants, 
whether they be engineers, financial analysts, marketing professionals, or quality 
control specialists, work together under the guidance of a project manager to com￾plete a project.
The fourth characteristic of a project is that it is nonroutine and has some unique 
elements. This is not an either/or issue but a matter of degree. Obviously, accom￾plishing something that has never been done before, such as building an electric 
automobile or landing two mechanical rovers on Mars, requires solving previously 
unsolved problems and using breakthrough technology. On the other hand, even 
basic construction projects that involve established sets of routines and procedures 
require some degree of customization that makes them unique. See Snapshot from 
Practice 1.3: London Calling: Seattle Seahawks versus Oakland Raiders for an 
unusual change in routine.
Finally, specific time, cost, and performance requirements bind projects. Projects 
are evaluated according to accomplishment, cost, and time spent. These triple con￾straints impose a higher degree of accountability than typically found in most jobs. 
These three also highlight one of the primary functions of project management, which 
is balancing the trade-offs among time, cost, and performance while ultimately satis￾fying the customer.
What a Project Is Not
Projects should not be confused with everyday work. A project is not routine, repetitive 
work! Ordinary daily work typically requires doing the same or similar work over and 
over, while a project is done only once; a new product or service exists when the proj￾ect is completed. Examine the list in Table 1.1 that compares routine, repetitive work 
and projects. Recognizing the difference is important because too often resources can 
be used up on daily operations, which may not contribute to longer-range organization 
strategies that require innovative new products.

On October 7, 2018, the National Foot￾ball League (NFL) Seattle Seahawks 
walked off the field having played their 
best game of the season, only to fall 
short to the undefeated Los Angeles 
Rams, 33-31. Next on the schedule was an away game 
with the Oakland Raiders. Instead of heading about 
670 miles south to Oakland, California, however, the 
Seahawks flew nearly 5,000 miles to London, England, 
eight time zones away, to spread the gospel of the NFL.
Sending an NFL team overseas during the season is 
no easy task. Advanced planning is critical. Players need 
passports. Accommodations have to be found and trans￾portation arranged. The equipment staff sends supplies 
months in advance. All total, the Seahawks ended up 
shipping 21,000 pounds of gear and products, including 
1,150 rolls of athletic tape, 2 tons of medical supplies, 
350 power adapters, and 500 pairs of shoes!
Two of the biggest challenges the “Hawks” faced were 
jet lag and distractions. Many of the players and staff had 
never been overseas. London would be a strange, excit￾ing experience. With this in mind, head coach Pete Carroll 
decided to fly early to London on Wednesday, October 10. 
This would allow players to better adjust their sleep pat￾terns while providing some free time to explore London.
WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 10
The Seahawks boarded a chartered jet that included 45 
sleeping pods in first class for the veteran players. Coach 
Carroll and his staff sat in the first row of business class. 
Rookies and members of the practice squad sat behind 
them. Regardless of class, everyone got the same menu: 
beef filet, Cajun chicken, or herb-roasted salmon.
Typically, on flights to the east, Sam Ramsden, the 
team’s director of health and player performance, tells 
players to stay awake so they will be tired and sleep 
well when they arrive. For the London trip, though, 
Ramsden reversed the program: he told players to 
sleep as much as possible on the flight so that when 
they arrived in London on Thursday afternoon, they 
would have enough energy to stay up until 9 or 10 p.m. 
and then get a full night’s rest. “We try to protect their 
circadian rhythms as much as possible,” Ramsden said. 
Circadian rhythm (also known as body clock) is a natu￾ral, internal system that’s designed to regulate feelings 
of sleepiness and wakefulness over a 24-hour period.
Ramsden’s staff gave each player special sleep kits 
that included blackout eye masks. Some players took 
melatonin or Ambien, while others used headphones 
that played the sounds of wind and rushing water to 
induce sleep.
THURSDAY, OCTOBER 11
The Seahawks landed on Thursday about 1:30 p.m. 
(5:30 a.m. Seattle time). Buses took them to a golf 
course resort north of London.
At night, the players let off some steam at a Topgolf 
facility. Here organized into groups of four, they tried to 
hit golf balls into giant holes to score points. Jeers rang 
out every time they were wildly off target.
FRIDAY, OCTOBER 12
After several hours of meetings and a practice, play￾ers were free to explore London. They scattered to the 
various corners of London. On returning to the resort 
before the 11:00 p.m. curfew, a few of the players com￾plained about the warm English beer.
The Oakland Raiders arrived in London at 1:00 
p.m., 53 hours before game time.
SATURDAY, OCTOBER 13
Coach Carroll likes to take his players to the stadium 
the day before a road game so they can visualize 
conditions ahead of time. At 1:30 p.m., the Seahawks 
drove to Wembley, where they saw their fully Seahawk￾equipped locker room and the field, the most famous 
soccer pitch in England. The field appeared slick, so 
the equipment manager had longer screw-in cleats 
available for the players. The Hawks returned to their 
resort for their normal pregame evening routine.
GAMEDAY, OCTOBER 14
During the course of the game, the TV announcers 
commented several times that the Raiders seemed 
sluggish, while the Seahawks were sharp and focused. 
The Seahawks dominated the game, winning 27–3.

Program versus Project
In practice, the terms project and program cause confusion. They are often used syn￾onymously. A program is a group of related projects designed to accomplish a com￾mon goal over an extended period of time. Each project within a program has a project 
manager. The major differences lie in scale and time span.
Program management is the process of managing a group of ongoing, interdepen￾dent, related projects in a coordinated way to achieve strategic objectives. For exam￾ple, a pharmaceutical organization could have a program for curing cancer. The cancer 
program includes and coordinates all cancer projects that continue over an extended 
time horizon (Gray, 2011). Coordinating all cancer projects under the oversight of a 
cancer team provides benefits not available from managing them individually. This 
cancer team also oversees the selection and prioritizing of cancer projects that are 
included in their special “Cancer” portfolio. Although each project retains its own 
goals and scope, the project manager and team are also motivated by the higher pro￾gram goal. Program goals are closely related to broad strategic organization goals.
The Project Life Cycle
Another way of illustrating the unique nature of project work is in terms of the project 
life cycle. The life cycle recognizes that projects have a limited lifespan and that there 
are predictable changes in the level of effort and focus over the life of the project. 
There are a number of different life-cycle models in project management literature. 
Many are unique to a specific industry or type of project. For example, a new-software 
development project may consist of five phases: definition, design, code, integration/
test, and maintenance. A generic cycle is depicted in Figure 1.1.
The project life cycle typically passes sequentially through four stages: defining, 
planning, executing, and closing. The starting point begins the moment the project is 
given the go-ahead. Project effort starts slowly, builds to a peak, and then declines to 
delivery of the project to the customer.
1. Defining stage. Specifications of the project are defined; project objectives are 
established; teams are formed; major responsibilities are assigned.
2. Planning stage. The level of effort increases, and plans are developed to determine 
what the project will entail, when it will be scheduled, whom it will benefit, what 
quality level should be maintained, and what the budget will be.
3. Executing stage. A major portion of the project work takes place—both physical 
and mental. The physical product is produced (e.g., a bridge, a report, a software 
program). Time, cost, and specification measures are used for control. Is the project

on schedule, on budget, and meeting specifications? What are the forecasts of each 
of these measures? What revisions/changes are necessary?
4. Closing stage. Closing includes three activities: delivering the project product to 
the customer, redeploying project resources, and conducting a post-project review. 
Delivery of the project might include customer training and transferring documents. 
Redeployment usually involves releasing project equipment/materials to other proj￾ects and finding new assignments for team members. Post-project reviews include 
not only assessing performance but also capturing lessons learned.
In practice, the project life cycle is used by some project groups to depict the tim￾ing of major tasks over the life of the project. For example, the design team might 
plan a major commitment of resources in the defining stage, while the quality team 
would expect their major effort to increase in the latter stages of the project life cycle. 
Because most organizations have a portfolio of projects going on concurrently, each at 
a different stage of each project’s life cycle, careful planning and management at the 
organization and project levels are imperative.
The Project Manager
At first glance, project managers perform the same functions as other managers. That 
is, they plan, schedule, motivate, and control. However, what makes them unique is 
that they manage temporary, nonrepetitive activities to complete a fixed-life project. 
Unlike functional managers, who take over existing operations, project managers cre￾ate a project team and organization where none existed before. They must decide what 
and how things should be done instead of simply managing set processes. They must 
meet the challenges of each phase of the project life cycle and even oversee the dis￾solution of their operation when the project is completed.
Project managers must work with a diverse troupe of characters to complete proj￾ects. They are typically the direct link to the customer and must manage the tension

between customer expectations and what is feasible and reasonable. Project managers 
provide direction, coordination, and integration to the project team, which is often 
made up of part-time participants loyal to their functional departments. They often 
must work with a cadre of outsiders—vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors—who do 
not necessarily share their project allegiance.
Project managers are ultimately responsible for performance (frequently with too 
little authority). They must ensure that appropriate trade-offs are made among the 
time, cost, and performance requirements of the project. At the same time, unlike their 
functional counterparts, project managers often possess only rudimentary technical 
knowledge to make such decisions. Instead, they must orchestrate the completion of 
the project by inducing the right people, at the right time, to address the right issues 
and make the right decisions.
While project management is not for the timid, working on projects can be an 
extremely rewarding experience. Life on projects is rarely boring; each day is differ￾ent from the last. Since most projects are directed at solving some tangible problem or 
pursuing some useful opportunity, project managers find their work personally mean￾ingful and satisfying. They enjoy the act of creating something new and innovative. 
Project managers and team members can feel immense pride in their accomplishments, 
whether it is a new bridge, a new product, or a needed service. Project managers are 
often stars in their organization and well compensated.
Good project managers are always in demand. Every industry is looking for 
effective people who can get the right things done on time. See Snapshot from 
Practice 1.4: Ron Parker for an example of someone who leveraged his ability to 
manage projects to build a successful career in the glass products industry. Clearly, 
project management is a challenging and exciting profession. This text is intended 
to provide the necessary knowledge, perspective, and tools to enable students to 
accept the challenge.
1986    BS Business 
Administration—
Oregon State University
1986–1990 Food Products 
Manufacturing
1990–1994 Wood Products Manufacturing
1994–Current Glass Products Manufacturing
Upon completion of my business degree at Oregon 
State University, I was recruited by a Fortune 100 food 
products company for a first-line production supervi￾sor position. In that role, an opportunity came up for 
me to manage a project that involved rolling out a new 
statistical package-weight-control program throughout 
the factory. Successfully completing that project was 
instrumental in accelerating my career within the com￾pany, advancing from supervisor to product manager in 
less than three years.
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 1.4 Ron Parker
After four years in food products, I accepted an 
offer to join a wood products manufacturing company. 
Initially, my role in this company was human resource 
manager. My HR responsibilities included managing 
several projects to improve safety and employee reten￾tion. Successful completion of these projects led to a 
promotion to plant manager. In the plant manager role, 
I was tasked with building and managing a new wood 
door manufacturing factory. After successfully taking 
that factory to full production, I was promoted again, 
to corporate manager of continuous improvement. This 
“culture change” project involved implementing total 
quality management throughout 13 different manu￾facturing factories as well as all the indirect and sup￾port functions within the corporation. Shortly after we 
successfully ingrained this new culture in the company, 
the owner passed away, leading me to look for other 
employment.

lar60886_ch01_001-029.indd 11 10/14/23 11:36 am
I was able to leverage my previous experience and 
success to convince the owner of a struggling glass 
fabrication company to hire me. In this new role as 
general manager, I was tasked with turning the com￾pany around. This was my largest project yet. Turning a 
company around involves a myriad of smaller improve￾ment projects spanning from facilities and equipment 
improvements to product line additions and deletions 
to sales and marketing strategy and everything in 
between. In four years we successfully turned the com￾pany around to the extent that the owner was able to 
sell the company and comfortably retire.
Successfully turning that glass company around 
got the attention of a much larger competitor of ours, 
resulting in an offer of employment. This new offer 
involved the start-up of a $30M high-tech glass man￾ufacturing facility in another state. We were able to 
take that facility from a dirt field to the highest-volume 
manufacturing facility of its kind in the world in just 
three years. After building and operating this factory at 
a world-class benchmark level for eight years, I came 
across a new and exciting opportunity to help expand 
a strong glass fabrication company in Canada. I spent 
four years successfully transitioning this Canadian 
company from a medium-sized glass fabrication facility 
to one of the largest and most successful of its kind in 
North America.
After tiring of the “Great White North,” I found an 
opportunity to tackle the largest and most impactful 
project of my career. I’m currently VP of operations 
in a venture-funded, high-tech, start-up company. In 
this role, I’m overseeing the construction and start￾up of the first full-scale, high-volume electrochromic 
glass fabrication factory in the world. This new project 
involves building a company from the ground up and 
taking an exciting new technology from the lab to full￾scale commercialization. Success in this role, although 
still far from being certain, will eventually revolutionize 
the glass industry through the introduction of a product 
that dramatically improves the energy efficiency and 
occupant comfort of buildings around the world.
Looking back on my career, it is apparent that my 
degree of success has largely been the result of taking 
on and successfully completing successively larger and 
increasingly impactful projects.
There’s a saying that’s always resonated with me: 
“If your only tool is a hammer, all your problems look 
like nails.” Good tools are hard to come by and heavy 
to carry around. I like my tool bag filled with general￾ist tools: things like communication skills, leadership, 
common sense, judgment, reasoning, logic, and a 
strong sense of urgency. I often wonder how much 
more I could have accomplished, had I actually studied 
project management and had more of that toolset in 
my bag. With a bag full of strong generalist tools, you 
can tackle any problem in any business. Project man￾agement is clearly one of those skills where the bet￾ter you are at it, the higher your chances of success in 
any business environment. Having the tools is only part 
of the equation, though. To be successful, you must 
also be willing to run at problems/opportunities when 
everyone else is running away from them.
Ron Parker
Being Part of a Project Team
Most people’s first exposure to project management occurs while working as part of 
a team assigned to complete a specific project. Sometimes this work is full time, but 
in most cases, people work part-time on one or more projects. They must learn how 
to juggle their day-to-day commitments with additional project responsibilities. They 
may join a team with a long history of working together, in which case roles and norms 
are firmly established. Alternatively, their team may consist of strangers from differ￾ent departments and organizations. As such, they endure the growing pains of a group 
Final PDF to printer12 Chapter 1 Modern Project Management

evolving into a team. They need to be a positive force in helping the team coalesce into 
an effective project team.
Not only are there people issues, but project members are also expected to use 
project management tools and concepts. They develop or are given a project char￾ter or scope statement that defines the objectives and parameters of the project. 
They work with others to create a project schedule and budget that will guide proj￾ect execution. They need to understand project priorities so they can make inde￾pendent decisions. They must know how to monitor and report project progress. 
Although much of this book is written from the perspective of a project manager, 
the tools, concepts, and methods are critical to everyone working on a project. Proj￾ect members need to know how to avoid the dangers of scope creep, manage the 
critical path, engage in timely risk management, negotiate, and utilize virtual tools 
to communicate.
1.2 Agile Project Management
Traditional project management focuses on thorough planning up front. Planning 
requires predictability. For plans to be effective, managers have to have a good 
understanding of what is to be accomplished and how to do it. For example, when it 
comes to building a bridge, engineers can draw upon proven technology and design 
principles to plan and build the bridge. Not all projects enjoy such predictability. 
Figure 1.2 speaks to this issue.
Project uncertainty varies according to the extent the project scope is known and 
stable and the technology to be used is known and proven. Many projects, like the 
bridge project, product extensions, events, marketing campaigns, and so forth have 
well-established scopes and use proven technology, which provide predictability for 
effective planning. However, when the project scope and/or technology is not fully 
known, things become much less predictable and plan-driven methods suffer. Such 
was the case for software development projects where it was estimated that in 1995

American firms and agencies spent $81 billion for canceled software projects (The 
Standish Group, 1995). Fast forward to 2021, the cost of poor software quality in the 
United States was estimated to be over $2 trillion because of unsuccessful projects, 
software failure, and inferior quality legacy systems (Krasner, 2022).
Enter Agile project management (Agile PM). Agile methodologies emerged out 
of frustration with using traditional project management processes to develop soft￾ware. Software projects are notorious for having unstable scopes in which end-user 
requirements are discovered not defined up front. Agile PM is now being used across 
industries to manage projects with high levels of uncertainty. Examples of people 
encountering high-uncertainty work include software systems engineers, product 
designers, explorers, doctors, lawyers, and many problem-solving engineers.1
Fundamentally, Agile PM employs an incremental, iterative process sometimes 
referred to as a “rolling wave” approach to complete projects (see Figure 1.3). Instead 
of trying to plan for everything up front, the scope of the project evolves. That is, the 
final project design/outcome is not known in great detail and is continuously devel￾oped through a series of incremental iterations (waves). Iterations typically last from 
one to four weeks. The goal of each iteration is to make tangible progress such as 
defining a key requirement, solving a technical problem, or creating desired features 
to demonstrate to the customer. At the end of each iteration, progress is reviewed, 
adjustments are made, and a different iterative cycle begins. Each new iteration sub￾sumes the work of the previous iterations until the project is completed and the cus￾tomer is satisfied.
Agile PM focuses on active collaboration between the project team and customer 
representatives, breaking projects into small functional pieces, and adapting to chang￾ing requirements.
It is not simply a question of either/or. Agile methods are often used up front in 
the defining phase to establish specifications and requirements, and then traditional 
methods are used to plan, execute, and close the project. Agile methods are also used 
to address certain technical issues on a project while most of the project work is being 
managed in the traditional way. Hybrid project management has emerged as the name 
given to this blending of traditional and agile methodologies.
The internal dynamics on Agile projects is quite different from the traditional 
PM approach. Agile works best in small teams of four to eight members. Instead of 
directing and integrating the work of others, the project manager serves as a facilita￾tor and coach. The team manages itself, deciding who should do what and how it 
should be done.
Agile PM will be discussed in depth in Chapter 15 and where appropriate through￾out the text.

 It should be noted that PMBOK Guide also includes Incremental and Iterative as two additional approaches, which are 
beyond the scope of this text. Search pmi.org for further details.

1.3 Current Drivers of Project Management
Project management is no longer a special-need management. It is rapidly becoming a 
standard way of doing business. See Snapshot from Practice 1.5: Project Management 
in Action: 2019. An increasing percentage of the typical firm’s effort is being devoted 
to projects. The future promises an increase in the importance and role of projects in 
contributing to the strategic direction of organizations. Several reasons for this are 
discussed briefly in this section.
Compression of the Product Life Cycle
One of the most significant driving forces behind the demand for project management 
is the shortening of the product life cycle. For example, today in high-tech industries 
the product life cycle is averaging 6 months to 3 years. Only 30 years ago, life cycles 
of 10 to 15 years were not uncommon. Time-to-market for new products with short 
life cycles has become increasingly important. A common rule of thumb in the world 
of high-tech product development is that a 6-month project delay can result in a 33 
percent loss in product revenue share. Speed, therefore, becomes a competitive advan￾tage; more and more organizations are relying on cross-functional project teams to get 
new products and services to the market as quickly as possible.
Businesses and nonprofits thrive and 
survive based on their ability to man￾age projects that produce products 
and services that meet market needs. 
Here is a small sample of projects that 
are important to their companies’ futures.
INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC.: MONARCH 
PROJECT
The Monarch platform is an AI-driven robot featuring 
two arms with a long, blue tube attached that allows a 
doctor to steer a camera and other surgical implements 
deep inside the body. Intuitive hopes to one day use 
robots to not only diagnose but also treat lung cancer.
WALT DISNEY/MARVEL STUDIOS: CAPTAIN 
MARVEL
Captain Marvel is a superhero film based on Marvel 
Comics character Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. The 
film stars Academy Award–winner Brie Larson in the 
title role. It is Marvel’s first female-led superhero movie 
and is seen by many as a response to D.C.’s popular 
Wonder Woman film.
PROJECT C.U.R.E.: CARGO
Cargo projects deliver semi-trailer-sized cargo containers 
carrying medication donations to underresourced hospi￾tals, clinics, and community health centers in developing 
countries. Each 40-foot container delivers an average $4 
million worth of medical supplies and equipment.
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 1.5 Project Management in Action: 2019*
SIKORSKY-BOEING: DEFIANT PROJECT
Boeing and Sikorsky have teamed up to develop a proto￾type for the next-generation military helicopter. The SB-1 
Defiant is being built to travel faster, longer, and more 
quietly than other models. At stake is a billion-dollar-plus 
contract with the U.S. Department of Defense.
AUDI: E-TRON SUV
E-tron is Audi’s first entry into the all-electric vehicle 
market. It is a fully equipped, luxury SUV with a 220-
mile range. With a starting price of $74,800, it is meant 
to compete against Tesla’s electric SUV and Jaguar’s 
I-Pace, as well as establish Audi as a significant player 
in the growing all-electric market.
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: TROPICAL FOREST 
RESTORATION
In many parts of the tropics, deforestation results in 
areas dominated by colonizing ferns. The Dominican 
restoration project involves manually removing ferns 
and planting native trees and shrubs.

Knowledge Explosion
The growth in new knowledge has increased the complexity of projects because proj￾ects encompass the latest advances. For example, building a road 30 years ago was a 
somewhat simple process. Today, each area has increased in complexity, including 
materials, specifications, codes, aesthetics, equipment, and required specialists. Simi￾larly, in today’s digital, electronic age it is becoming hard to find a new product that 
does not contain at least one microchip. The same is likely to be true for artificial intel￾ligence (AI). Product complexity has increased the need to integrate divergent technol￾ogies. Project management has emerged as the key discipline for achieving this task.
Triple Bottom Line (Planet, People, Profit)
The threat of global warming has brought sustainable business practices to the fore￾front. Businesses can no longer simply focus on maximizing profit to the detriment of 
the environment and society. Efforts to reduce carbon imprints and utilize renewable 
resources are realized through effective project management. The impact of this move￾ment toward sustainability can be seen in changes in the objectives and techniques 
used to complete projects. For example, achieving a high LEED certification award is 
often an objective on construction projects.2
Increased Customer Focus
Increased competition has placed a premium on customer satisfaction. Customers no 
longer simply settle for generic products and services. They want customized products 
and services that cater to their specific needs. This mandate requires a much closer 
working relationship between the provider and the receiver. Account executives and 
sales representatives are assuming more of a project manager’s role as they work with 
their organization to satisfy the unique needs and requests of clients.
Increased customer attention has also prompted the development of customized 
products and services. For example, 25 years ago buying a set of golf clubs was a 
relatively simple process: you picked out a set based on price and feel. Today, there 
are golf clubs for tall players and short players, clubs for players who tend to slice the 
ball and clubs for those who hook the ball, high-tech clubs with the latest metallurgic 
discovery guaranteed to add distance, and so forth. Project management is critical both 
to developing customized products and services and to sustaining lucrative relation￾ships with customers.
Small Projects Represent Big Problems
The velocity of change required to remain competitive or simply keep up has created 
an organizational climate in which hundreds of projects are implemented concurrently. 
This climate has created a multiproject environment and a plethora of new problems. 
Sharing and prioritizing resources across a portfolio of projects is a major challenge 
for senior management. Many firms have no idea of the problems involved with the 
inefficient management of small projects. Small projects typically carry the same or 
more risk as large projects. Small projects are perceived as having little impact on 
the bottom line because they do not demand large amounts of scarce resources and/
or money. Because so many small projects are going on concurrently and because 
the perception of the inefficiency impact is small, measuring inefficiency is usually 
nonexistent. Unfortunately, many small projects soon add up to large sums of money.

 LEED certification was developed by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) and is one of the most 
popular green building certification programs used worldwide.

Many customers and millions of dollars are lost each year on small projects in product 
and service organizations. Small projects can represent hidden costs not measured in 
the accounting system.
Organizations with many small projects going on concurrently face the most dif￾ficult project management problems. A key question becomes one of how to create 
an organizational environment that supports multiproject management. A process is 
needed to prioritize and develop a portfolio of small projects that supports the mission 
of the organization.
In summary, there are a variety of environmental forces interacting in today’s busi￾ness world that contribute to the increased demand for good project management 
across all industries and sectors.
1.4 Project Management Today: A Socio-Technical Approach
Project management has shaped the world we live (see Snapshot from Practice 1.6: 
PMI’s 50 Most Influential Projects 1969–2019). Managing projects is a multidimen￾sional process (see Figure 1.4). The first dimension is the technical side of the man￾agement process, which consists of the formal, disciplined, purely logical parts of the 
process. This technical dimension consists of project management methodology: plan￾ning, scheduling, and controlling projects. Clear project scope statements are written 
to link the project and customer and to facilitate planning and control. Creation of the 
deliverables and work breakdown structures facilitates planning and monitoring the 
progress of the project. The work breakdown structure serves as a database that links 
all levels in the organization, major deliverables, and all work—right down to the tasks 
in a work package. Effects of project changes are documented and traceable. Thus, any 
change in one part of the project is traceable to the source by the integrated linkages of 
the system. This integrated information approach can provide all project managers and 
the customer with decision information appropriate to their level and needs. A success￾ful project manager will be well trained in the technical side of managing projects.

To commemorate its 50th year, the 
Project Management Institute (PMI) 
undertook a yearlong research initia￾tive: to identify the 50 most influential 
projects of the last 50 years. They 
reached out to more than 400 experts—from leading 
academics to influential authors, their Global Executive 
Council as well as to their global chapter communities. 
Thousands of projects were examined, with the over￾riding criteria: Did they reshape our expectations, defy 
convention, and transform an industry or our culture in 
ways that continue to reverberate? The final selections 
provide an inspirational reflection on what project work 
has enabled and the central role project management 
has played in creating the world we live in. The top five 
projects were:
1. World Wide Web—for single-handedly revolution￾izing how we live, work, think, and play.
2. Apollo 11—for proving risk management and out￾of-this-world ambitions can make the impossible 
possible.
3. Intel 4004—for creating the microprocessor that 
democratized the power of computing.
4. Euro—for flawlessly executing the largest mon￾etary changeover in the industry.
5. Human Genome Project—for rising above usual 
silos and unlocking the building block of human￾ity and enabling unparallel innovation in medicine 
and life sciences.
Other projects cited included:
• Singles Day—for creating the largest e-commerce 
day in the world and fundamentally shifting how 
we shopped.
• Prius Automobile—for forcing the auto industry 
toward a more sustainable future.
• 1985 Live Aid Concert—for re-imaging the magni￾tude and model of philanthropy with a major dose 
of celebrity.
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 1.6 PMI’s 50 Most Influential Projects 
1969–2019*
• Rwanda National Unity and Reconciliation 
Commission—for forging a path to recovery/
redemption amid severe trauma.
• Walt Disney World—for setting the bar on immersive 
entertainment and then raising it again and again.
• Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)—for taking 
much of the mystery out of medicine.
• iPod—for being able to contain one thousand 
songs in your pocket and being the gateway prod￾uct to the i-universe.
• Global Polio Eradication Program—for creating 
the world’s largest health initiative and bringing a 
deadly disease to the brink of extinction.
• Wikipedia—for tapping the world’s collective 
knowledge with a radically collaborative online 
encyclopedia.
It should be noted that most of these “projects” 
consisted of a series of projects often conducted by 
different people and organizations. Many would be 
considered programs.

The second and opposing dimension is the sociocultural side of project manage￾ment. In contrast to the orderly world of project planning, this dimension involves the 
much messier, often contradictory and paradoxical world of implementation. It cen￾ters on creating a temporary social system within a larger organizational environment 
that combines the talents of professionals working to complete the project. Project 
managers must try to shape a project culture that stimulates teamwork and high levels 
Final PDF to printer18 Chapter 1 Modern Project Management
lar60886_ch01_001-029.indd 18 10/14/23 11:36 am
of personal motivation as well as a capacity to quickly identify and resolve problems 
that threaten project work. Things rarely go as planned and project managers must be 
able to steer the project back on track or alter directions when necessary.
The sociocultural dimension also involves managing the interface between the proj￾ect and the external environment. Project managers have to assuage and shape the 
expectations of customers, sustain the political support of top management, and nego￾tiate with their functional counterparts, monitor subcontractors, and so on. Overall, 
the manager must build a cooperative social network among an often divergent set of 
stakeholders with different standards, commitments, and perspectives.
Some suggest that the technical dimension represents the “science” of project man￾agement, while the sociocultural dimension represents the “art” of managing a project. 
Frankly, we believe there is less art behind managing projects as the term would sug￾gest. Best practices and research exist to suggest there is more science behind manag￾ing the sociocultural dimension than previously existed. This text has a reflection of 
this progress.
To be successful, a manager must be a master of both. Unfortunately, some project 
managers become preoccupied with the planning and technical dimension of project man￾agement. Often their first real exposure to project management is through project manage￾ment software, and they become infatuated with network charts, Gantt diagrams, and 
performance variances; they attempt to manage a project from a distance. Conversely, 
there are other managers who manage projects by the “seat of their pants,” relying heav￾ily on charisma and organizational politics to complete a project. Good project manag￾ers work with others to balance their attention to both the technical and sociocultural 
aspects of project management.
Summary Project management is a critical skill set in today’s world. A project is defined as 
a nonroutine, one-time effort limited by time, resources, and performance specifica￾tions designed to meet customer needs. One of the distinguishing characteristics of 
project management is that it has both a beginning and an end and typically consists 
of four phases: defining, planning, executing, and closing. Successful implementation 
requires both technical and social skills. Project managers have to plan and budget 
projects as well as orchestrate the contributions of others.
This text is written to provide the reader with a comprehensive, socio-technical under￾standing of project management. The text focuses on not only project methodology but 
also on how people apply these methods to successfully complete projects. Following 
this introductory chapter, Chapter 2 focuses on how organizations go about evaluating 
and selecting projects. Special attention is devoted to the importance of aligning proj￾ect selection to the mission and strategy of the firm. The organizational environment 
in which projects are implemented is the focus of Chapter 3. The discussion of matrix 
management and other organizational forms is augmented by a discussion of the sig￾nificant role the culture of an organization plays in the implementation of projects.
The next six chapters focus on developing a plan for the project; after all, project 
success begins with a good plan. Chapter 4 deals with defining the scope of the proj￾ect and developing a work breakdown structure (WBS). The challenge of formulating 
cost and time estimates is the subject of Chapter 5. Chapter 6 focuses on utilizing 
Text Overview

the information from the WBS to create a project plan in the form of a timed and 
sequenced network of activities.
Risks are a potential threat to every project, and Chapter 7 examines how organiza￾tions and managers identify and manage risks associated with project work. Resource 
allocation is added to the plan in Chapter 8, with special attention devoted to how 
resource limitations impact the project schedule. After a resource schedule is estab￾lished, a project time-phased budget is developed. Finally, Chapter 9 examines strate￾gies for reducing (“crashing”) project time either prior to the initiation of the project or 
in response to problems or new demands placed on the project. Throughout all these 
technical discussions, the sociocultural aspects are highlighted.
Chapters 10 through 12 focus on project implementation and the sociocultural side 
of project management. Chapter 10 focuses on the role of the project manager as a 
leader and stresses the importance of managing project stakeholders within the organi￾zation. Chapter 11 focuses on the core project team; it combines the latest information 
on team dynamics with leadership skills/techniques for developing a high-performance 
project team. Chapter 12 continues the theme of managing project stakeholders by dis￾cussing how to outsource project work and negotiate with contractors, customers, and 
suppliers.
Chapter 13 focuses on the kinds of information managers use to monitor project 
progress, with special attention devoted to the key concept of earned value. The proj￾ect life cycle is completed with Chapter 14, which covers closing out a project and the 
important assessment of performance and lessons learned. Agile project management, 
a much more flexible approach to managing projects with high degree of uncertainty, 
is the subject of Chapter 15. Finally, so many projects today are global; Chapter 16 
focuses on working on projects across cultures.
Throughout this text, you will be exposed to the major aspects of the project man￾agement process. However, a true understanding of project management comes not 
from knowing what a scope statement is, or the critical path, or partnering with con￾tractors, but from comprehending how the different elements of the project manage￾ment system interact to determine the fate of a project. If by the end of this text, you 
come to appreciate and begin to master both the technical and sociocultural dimen￾sions of project management, you should have a distinct competitive advantage over 
others aspiring to work in the field of project management.

 Case 1.1
A Day in the Life—2024
Troi, the project manager of a large information systems project, arrives at her office 
early to get caught up with work before her co-workers and project team arrive. How￾ever, as she enters the office she meets Akeem, one of her fellow project managers, 
who also wants to get an early start on the day. Akeem has just completed a project 
overseas. They spend 10 minutes socializing and catching up on personal news.
Troi walks to her desk and opens her laptop. She was at her client’s site the day 
before until 7:30 p.m. and has not checked her e-mail or voice mail since 4:30 p.m. the 
previous day. She has 2 voicemails, 16 e-mails, and 10 posts on her team Slack chan￾nel.1
 She spends 15 minutes reviewing her schedule and “to-do” lists for the day before 
responding to messages that require immediate attention.
Troi spends the next 25 minutes going over project reports and preparing for the 
weekly standup meeting. Her manager who just arrived at the office, interrupts her. 
They spend 20 minutes discussing the project. He shares a rumor about a potential 
acquisition he’s heard about. She tells him she hasn’t heard anything but will keep him 
posted if she does.
The 9:00 a.m. project status meeting starts 15 minutes late because two of the team 
members have to finish a job for a client. Several people go to the cafeteria to get cof￾fee and doughnuts while others discuss last night’s baseball game. The team members 
arrive, and the remaining 45 minutes of the progress review meeting surface project 
issues that have to be addressed and assigned for action.
After the meeting, Troi goes down the hallway to meet with Achara, another IS 
project manager. They spend 30 minutes reviewing project assignments, since the two

of them share personnel. Achara’s project is behind schedule and in need of help. Troi 
offers to free up some of the team’s time to help her get back on track.
Troi returns to her office and makes several phone calls and returns several e-mails 
before walking downstairs to visit with members of her project team. Her intent is to 
follow up on an issue that surfaced in the status report meeting. However, her simple, 
“Hi, you all, how are things going?” elicits a stream of disgruntled responses. After 
listening patiently for over 20 minutes, she realizes that among other things several 
of the client’s managers are beginning to request features that were not in the original 
project scope statement. She tells her people that she will get on this right away.
Returning to her office, she tries to call her counterpart, John, at the client firm but 
is told that he is not expected back from lunch for another hour. At this time, Eddie 
drops by and says, “How about lunch?” Eddie works in the finance office and they 
spend the next half hour in the company cafeteria gossiping about internal politics. 
She is surprised to hear that Jonah Johnson, the director of systems projects, may join 
another firm. Jonah has always been a powerful ally.
She returns to her office, answers a few more e-mails, catches up on Slack, and 
finally gets through to John. They spend 30 minutes going over the problem. The 
conversation ends with John promising to do some investigating and get back to her as 
soon as possible.
Troi goes outside to the company’s atrium, where she sits next to a creek, meditat￾ing for 30 minutes.
Troi then takes the elevator to the third floor and talks to the purchasing agent 
assigned to her project. They spend the next 30 minutes exploring ways of getting the 
necessary equipment to the project site earlier than planned. She finally authorizes 
express delivery.
When she returns to her desk, her watch reminds her that she is scheduled to participate 
in a Zoom meeting at 2:30 p.m. It takes 10 minutes for everyone to get online due to prob￾lems with the technology. During this time, Troi catches up on some e-mail. She spends 
the next hour exchanging information about the technical requirements associated with a 
new version of a software package they are using on systems projects like hers.
Troi decides to stretch her legs and goes on a walk down the hallway, where she 
engages in brief conversations with various co-workers. She goes out of her way to

 Case 1.2
The Hokies Lunch Group1
PART A
Fatma settled down for lunch at the Yank Sing Chinese restaurant. She was early and 
took the time to catch up on her e-mail. Soon she would be joined by Jasper and Vikto￾ria, two fellows 2014 grads from Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia.
Jasper worked as a software engineer for a start-up company that wanted to expand 
the boundaries of sharing economy. Viktoria was an electrical engineer who worked for 
a German healthcare company in San Francisco. They had met each other at a Silicon 
Valley alumni reception hosted by Virginia Tech. Each of them felt a bit like a fish out of 
water on the West Coast, so they decided to have lunch together each month. The lunch 
evolved into a professional support group. A major part of each of their jobs was manag￾ing projects, and they found it useful to share issues and seek advice from each other.
Fatma worked for a very successful Internet company whose founders believed that 
everyone in the firm should devote three days a year to community service projects. 
The company was partnering with several companies in the construction industry to 
renovate abandoned buildings for low-income families. The next project was the reno￾vation of an empty warehouse into eight two-bedroom apartments. Fatma was part of 
the core team in charge of scheduling and managing work assignments.
Viktoria and Jasper entered the restaurant together. Viktoria was the first to move 
to the Bay Area. She was currently working on the next-generation neural stimulator 
(“PAX 2”). Neural stimulators are electronic devices that doctors implant in patients 
with wires connected to sources of pain in the patient’s spine. In the past, patients 
would have to have an operation to replace the stimulator battery every 10 years. 
PAX 2 was being designed to take advantage of new battery technologies and use 
a rechargeable battery. In concept, this battery system would eliminate the need for 
replacement surgeries and allow the implanted battery to be recharged externally. 
Viktoria’s team had just completed the second prototype and was entering a critical 
testing phase. It had been tricky trying to predict the lifespan of the new rechargeable 
battery without testing it in real-time. She was anxious to begin seeing the test results.
Jasper was working for a start-up company after doing contract work for his first 
nine months in San Francisco. He was sworn to secrecy about the project and all Fatma 
and Viktoria knew was that the project had something to do with sharing economy. He 
was working with a small development team that included colleagues from Bangalore, 
India, and Malmo, Sweden.
After ordering and chit-chatting a bit, Fatma started the discussion. “I will be glad 
when this week is over,” she said. “We’ve been struggling defining the scope of the

30 minutes working with “what-if ” scenarios. She reviews tomorrow’s schedule and 
writes some personal reminders before starting off on her 30-minute commute home.
1. How effectively do you think Troi spent her day?
2. What does the case tell you about what it is like to be a project manager?

project. At first glance our project seems relatively simple, build eight two-bedroom 
apartments in an old warehouse. But there are a lot of unanswered questions. What 
kind of community space do we want to have? How efficient should the energy system 
be? What kind of furniture? Everybody wants to do a good job, but when does low￾income housing morph into middle-income housing?”
Viktoria offered, “Scope defining is one of the things my company does very well. 
Before a project is authorized, a detailed scope statement is developed that clearly 
defines the project objectives, priorities, budget, requirements, limits, and exclusions. 
All of the key stakeholders sign off on it. It is really important to identify priorities up￾front. I know on the PAX 2 project that scope is the number one priority. I know that 
no matter how long it takes it is imperative that my work is done right.”
Fatma responded, “That’s exactly what my project manager is preparing for Friday’s 
meeting. I guess that one of the things you have to do as a project manager is end dis￾cussions. He is going to make the tough calls and finalize the project scope so we can 
begin planning.”
Jasper interjected, “You all are so lucky; for the most part your scope remains the 
same. In my work the scope is constantly changing. You show the founders a feature 
they wanted, and they say, well, if you can do that, can you do this? You know it’s 
going to happen, but you really can’t plan for it.”
Jasper went on, “We do know what our number one priority is: time. There are a lot 
of players trying to move in to the ‘space’ we are working on. We have to demonstrate 
we are ahead of the pack if we are going to continue to get VC funding.2
”
Jasper said that despite the pressure, his project had been a lot of fun. He especially 
liked working with his Swedish and Indian counterparts, Askel and Sree. They worked 
like a global tag team on their part of the project. Jasper would code and then pass his 
work on to Sree, who would work on it and pass it on to Askel, who would eventually 
hand it off to Jasper. Given the time zones, they were able to have at least one person 
working on the code around the clock.
Jasper said it was hard at first working with someone he hadn’t met personally other 
than on a video screen. Trust was an issue. Everyone was trying to prove themselves. 
Eventually, a friendly competition arose across the team. The programmers exchanged 
funny cartoons and YouTube videos. He showed Fatma and Viktoria a YouTube video 
about scope creep that got a chuckle from everyone.
They made plans to meet next at the new Peruvian restaurant on SE 8th Street.
PART B
The Peruvian cilantro/lime ceviche was a big hit at the next lunch. Viktoria began their 
discussion by reporting, “I have good and bad news. The bad news is that our first pro￾totype failed its tests miserably. The good news is that I have a smart project manager. 
She knew this could happen, so she mitigated the risk by having us working on two 
alternative battery technologies. The alternative technology is passing all of the tests. 
Instead of falling behind months, we are only days behind schedule.”
This precipitated a discussion of risk management. Fatma reported that there had 
been a two-day session on risk management for the renovation project. They spent 
the first day brainstorming what could go wrong, and the second day coming up with 
strategies for dealing with risks. A big help was the risk report that was generated 
after the last project. The report detailed all of the problems that had occurred on the 
last renovation project as well as recommendations. Fatma said, “I couldn’t believe 
how much time and attention was devoted to safety, but as my project manager said, 
‘all it takes is one bad accident to shut down a project for weeks, even months.’”

Jasper reported that on his project they spent very little time on risk management. 
His project was driven by a build-test mentality. “Everybody assumes that daily testing 
eliminates problems, but when it’s time to integrate different features, that’s when the 
real bugs will emerge,” Jasper said.
Jasper went on to say that things were not going well at work. They had missed their 
second straight milestone, and everyone was feeling the pressure to show results. “I even 
slept by my cubicle three nights ago,” Jasper confessed. Fatma asked, “How many hours 
are you working?” “I don’t know, at least 70, maybe 80 hours,” Jasper answered. He 
went on to say, “This is a high-stakes project, with a BIG upside if successful. I am doing 
some of my best programming and we’ll just have to see what happens.”
Jasper showed them a cartoon that was being circulated across his team. The cap￾tion read “When did you want it done? Yesterday.”
Fatma turned to her friends and said, “I need some advice. As you know, I’m 
responsible for scheduling work assignments. Well, some of my colleagues have been 
pretty aggressive in lobbying for choice assignments. Everyone wants to work along￾side Bruno or Reese. Suddenly I am everyone’s friend, and certain people are going 
way out of their way to do favors for me. I am sure they think it will influence my deci￾sions. It’s getting awkward and I am not sure what to do.”
“Quid pro quo,” answered Jasper, “that’s how the business world works. You scratch 
my back and I’ll scratch yours. Within reason, I don’t have a problem with someone 
taking advantage of their position to garner favors and build relationships.”
Viktoria said, “I disagree. You don’t want to be seen as someone whose influence 
can be bought. You need to think what’s best for the company. You need to ask your￾self what Bruno and Reese would want you to do. And if you don’t know, ask them.”
After much discussion, Fatma left the restaurant leaning toward Viktoria’s advice, 
but she wasn’t sure what the guidelines should be.
PART C
It took two months for the Hokies lunch group to get together again. Jasper had canceled 
the last meeting because of work, so Viktoria and Fatma saw a movie together instead.
Jasper was the last person to arrive at the Russian bakery and it was clear from the 
look on his face that things were not going well. He sat down, avoiding eye contact, 
before blurting, “I’m out of work.” “What do you mean?” Fatma and Viktoria cried. 
Jasper explained after months and months of work they had been unable to demon￾strate a functional product.
Jasper went on to say, “Despite our best efforts we couldn’t deliver. The founders 
couldn’t get an ounce of second-round venture funding, so they decided to cut their losses 
and kill the project. I just spent the best six months of my programming life for nothing.”
Fatma and Viktoria tried to comfort their friend. Fatma asked Jasper how the others 
were taking the news. Jasper said the Swedish programmer, Askel, took the news very 
hard. He went on to say, “I think he was burning a lot of bridges at home with the long 
work hours and now he has nothing to show for it. He started blaming us for mistakes 
we never made.” Sree, his Indian counterpart, was a different story. “Sree seemed to 
shrug her shoulders.” Jasper added, “She said, ‘I know I am a good programmer. There 
are lots of opportunities here in Bangalore.’”
Fatma broke the silence that followed by saying to Jasper, “Send me your resume. 
My company is always looking for top-notch programmers and it is a really great 
company. Can you believe it, the two founders, Bruno and Reese, are working side by 
side with everyone on renovating the warehouse? In fact, people were amazed at how 
good Bruno was with sheet rock. A big part of my job now is scheduling their time so 
they can work with as many different people as possible. They really want to use the

project to get to know their employees. This hasn’t been easy. I have had to juggle their 
calendars, their abilities, and work opportunities.”
Viktoria interjected, “You’re using Microsoft Project to do this?” “Not really,” 
responded Fatma. “At first I tried scheduling their work in Microsoft Project, but it 
was too cumbersome and time-consuming. Now I just use the Project master schedule 
and each of their calendars to schedule their work. This seems to work best.”
Viktoria added, “Yeah, Microsoft Project is a great program, but you can get lost 
trying to get it to do everything. Sometimes all you need is an Excel sheet and com￾mon sense.”
Viktoria felt awkward, given what had happened to Jasper. She was just wrapping 
up the successful PAX 2 project. She was also getting ready for a well-deserved holi￾day in Vietnam paid for by her project bonus. “I hate closing out a project,” Viktoria 
said. “It’s so boring. Document, document, document! I keep kicking myself for not 
tracking things when they happened. I am spending most of my time scouring my 
computer for files. I can’t wait to take off to Vietnam.”
Viktoria went on to say, “The only thing I liked doing was the project retrospective.”
Jasper asked, “What’s a project retrospective?” Viktoria answered, “It’s when the 
project team gets together and reviews what went well and what didn’t and identifies 
lessons learned that we can apply to future projects. For example, one of the things we 
learned was that we needed to bring the manufacturing people on board a lot sooner in 
the design process. We focused on designing the very best product possible, regardless 
of cost. We found out later that there were ways for reducing production costs without 
compromising quality.”
Fatma added, “We do that, too, at the end of our projects, but we call it an audit.”
Fatma asked Viktoria, “Do you know what your next assignment will be?” “No,” 
she replied, “I will probably go back to my department and do some testing. I’m not 
worried. I did good work. I am sure someone will want me for their project.”
Jasper chimed in, “I sure hope someone wants me for their next project.” Fatma and 
Viktoria immediately went into action, trying to lift their friend’s spirits.
A little while later, they walked out of the restaurant and gave each other hugs. 
Fatma reminded Jasper to send her his latest resume.

2021 PMI: A Guide to the Project Management Body 
of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) Seventh Edition and Its 
Ancillaries
In 2021, PMI took two major steps in the right direction by publishing a significant 
revision of PMBOK Guide and introducing the Standard for Project Management 
(SPM). The new, seventh edition of PMBOK Guide adopts a systems perspective 
instead of the previous process orientation. Processes are still important to manag￾ing projects, but the PMBOK Guide, seventh edition, utilizes a more socio-technical

approach to focus on the delivery of value. Value may come in the form of a new 
product or service, improving efficiency and operations, sustaining benefits, or having 
a positive social or environmental impact.
The SPM sets forth for the first time, 12 principles that provide foundational guide￾lines for managing projects. The principles are broadly based so there is no one best 
way to apply them, but rather they need to be “tailored” to the situation. These prin￾ciples are consistent with the philosophy and approach the authors have championed 
since our first edition. Figure A1.1 displays how PMI summarizes the 12 principles 
and their relationship to project performance domains.

Also in 2023, PMI released a new book, entitled Process Groups: A Practice Guide.
This book contains a discussion of all the processes that made up the earlier, sixth edition 
of PMBOK Guide. Now PMI has both a process-based guide and a principle-based stan￾dard. There is a significant need for both. The process-based guide provides “how to” 
knowledge or procedural knowledge necessary to manage projects. The message of the 
seventh edition of PMBOK Guide is this must be done while applying the 12 principles 
and 10 performance domains that are extolled by the seventh edition of PMBOK Guide.1
It is worth noting that the newest version of PMBOK Guide is not intended for stu￾dents or first-time aspiring project managers who know nothing about project manage￾ment. The material provides less procedural knowledge in the sense of a “cookbook” 
that tells you what to do step-by-step. Most project management textbooks start with a 
definition of project management and then discussion of scope followed by a determi￾nation of tasks from the work breakdown structure (WBS), followed by a sequencing 
of those tasks, estimates of the task durations, assignment of resources, scheduling, 
and costs, etc. In most books, there is a lot of procedural substance; not so for the 
seventh edition of PMBOK Guide. It appears this newest edition is intended for a sea￾soned project management professional who must be insightful enough to know where 
the principle-based declarative knowledge can be applied.
The seventh edition of PMBOK Guide does not provide many examples of how and 
where the principles and performance domains can be applied. Fortunately, this is one 
of the strengths of this text.
This text was never intended as a primer for taking the PMP or CAPM exam. Our 
goal was to share our passion for managing projects and provide readers with essential 
insights and tools to be successful. The text is based on research on project manage￾ment, hundreds of interviews and discussions with project professionals, and our own 
experience managing projects. We are confident that we are providing the student with 
a solid foundation for passing either exam. See Exhibit A1.1 for a cross-reference of 
PMBOK Guide concepts to text topics.

A vision without a strategy remains an illusion.
—Lee Bolman, Professor of Leadership, University of Missouri–Kansas City.
Strategy is fundamentally deciding how the organization will compete. Organizations 
use projects to convert strategy into new products, services, and processes needed for 
success. For example, Intel’s major strategy is one of differentiation. Intel relies on 
projects to create specialty chips for products other than computers, such as autos, 
security, cell phones, and air controls. Another strategy is to reduce project cycle 
times. Procter and Gamble, NEC, General Electric, and AT&T have reduced their 
cycle times by 20–50 percent. Toyota and other auto manufacturers are now able to 
design and develop new cars in two to three years instead of five to seven years. Proj￾ects and project management play the key role in supporting strategic goals. It is vital 
for project managers to think and act strategically.
Aligning projects with the strategic goals of the organization is crucial for business 
success. Today’s economic climate is unprecedented by rapid changes in technology, 
global competition, financial uncertainty, and disease outbreaks. These conditions 
make strategy/project alignment even more essential for success.
The larger and more diverse an organization, the more difficult it is to create and 
maintain a strong link between strategy and projects. How can an organization ensure 
this link? The answer requires integration of projects with the strategic plan. Integra￾tion assumes the existence of a strategic plan and a process for prioritizing projects by 
their contribution to the plan. A key factor to ensure the success of integrating the plan 
with projects is an open and transparent selection process for all participants to review.
This chapter presents an overview of the importance of strategic planning and the 
process for developing a strategic plan. Typical problems encountered when strategy 
and projects are not linked are noted. A generic methodology that ensures integration 
by creating strong linkages of project selection and priority to the strategic plan is 
then discussed. The intended outcomes are clear organization focus, best use of scarce 
organization resources (people, equipment, capital), and improved communication 
across projects and departments.

2.1 Why Project Managers Need to Understand Strategy
Project management historically has been preoccupied solely with the planning and 
execution of projects. Strategy was considered to be under the purview of senior man￾agement. This is old-school thinking. New-school thinking recognizes that project 
management is at the apex of strategy and operations. Shenhar speaks to this issue 
when he states, “It is time to expand the traditional role of the project manager from an 
operational to a more strategic perspective. In the modern evolving organization, proj￾ect managers will be focused on business aspects, and their role will expand from get￾ting the job done to achieving the business results and winning in the marketplace.”1
There are two main reasons project managers need to understand their organiza￾tion’s mission and strategy. The first reason is so they can make appropriate decisions 
and adjustments. For example, how a project manager would respond to a sugges￾tion to modify the design of a product to enhance performance will vary depending 
upon whether his/her company strives to be a product leader through innovation or 
to achieve operational excellence through low-cost solutions. Similarly, how a proj￾ect manager would respond to delays may vary depending upon strategic concerns. 
A project manager will authorize overtime if his/her firm places a premium on getting to 
the market first. Another project manager will accept the delay if speed is not essential.
The second reason project managers need to understand the strategic implications of 
their project is so they can be effective project advocates. Project managers have to be 
able to demonstrate to senior management how their project contributes to their firm’s 
mission in order to garner their continued support. Project managers need to be able to 
explain to stakeholders why certain project objectives and priorities are critical in order 
to secure buy-in on contentious trade-off decisions. Finally, project managers need to be 
able to redirect teams’ efforts when they drift off course. Being able to explain why a sug￾gestion or course of action is not appropriate in terms of strategic objectives will go a long 
way in building support within the team (Brown, Hyer, & Ettenson, 2013).
For these reasons, project managers will find it valuable to have a solid understand￾ing of strategic management and project selection processes, which are discussed next.
2.2 The Strategic Management Process: An Overview
Strategic management is the process of assessing “what we are” and deciding and imple￾menting “what we intend to be and how we are going to get there.” Strategy describes how 
an organization intends to compete with the resources available in the existing and per￾ceived future environment. Two major dimensions of strategic management are respond￾ing to changes in the external environment and allocating the firm’s scarce resources 
to improve its competitive position. Constant scanning of the external environment for 
changes is a major requirement for survival in a dynamic competitive environment. The 
second dimension is the internal responses to new action programs aimed at enhancing 
the competitive position of the firm. The nature of the responses depends on the type of 
business, environment volatility, competition, and organizational culture.
Strategic management provides the theme and focus of the future direction of the 
organization. It supports consistency of action at every level of the organization. 
It encourages integration because effort and resources are committed to common 
goals and strategies. Strategic management is a continuous, iterative process aimed 
at developing an integrated and coordinated long-term plan of action. Objectives 
Explain why it is impor￾tant for project manag￾ers to understand their 
organization’s strategy.

are set, and then translated into actions by implementing projects. See Snapshot 
from Practice 2.1: IBM’s Watson Project for an example of how IBM tried to use a 
TV game show to signal a shift in strategic focus.
On February 2010, millions of people 
were glued to their television sets 
to watch IBM’s Watson outclass two 
former champion contestants on the 
Jeopardy quiz show. Watson per￾formed at human expert levels in terms of precision, 
confidence, and speed during the show.
Watson’s triumph announced to the world IBM’s 
shift in strategic focus toward artificial intelligence (AI) 
driven business services. IBM’s management thought 
the technology behind Watson could do for the com￾pany what mainframe computer once did—be an 
engine for growth and profits for decades.
WATSON PROJECT DESCRIPTION
AI has advanced significantly in recent years. Watson 
goes beyond IBM’s chess-playing supercomputer of 
the late 1990s. Chess is finite, logical, and reduced 
easily to mathematics. Watson’s work is ill-defined and 
involves dealing with abstraction and the circumstan￾tial nature of language. Since Watson’s system can 
understand natural language, it can extend the way 
people interact with computers.
The IBM Watson project took three intense years of 
research and development by a core team of about 20. 
Eight university teams working on specific challenge 
areas augmented these researchers.
Watson depends on over 200 million pages of 
structured and unstructured data and a program 
capable of running trillions of operations per second. 
With this information backup, it attacks a Jeopardy
question by parsing the question into small pieces. 
With the question parsed, the program then searches 
for relevant data. Using hundreds of decision rules, 
the program generates possible answers. These 
answers are assigned a confidence score to decide if 
Watson should risk offering an answer and how much 
to bet.
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?
IBM invested millions of dollars in the next few years 
into promoting Watson as a benevolent digital assistant 
that would help hospitals and farms as well as offices 
and factories. The potential uses, IBM suggested, were 
boundless, from spotting new market opportunities 
to tackling cancer and climate change. An IBM report 
called it “the future of knowing.”
A decade since the Jeopardy victory, Watson 
has yet to revolutionize industries nor significantly 
lift IBM’s fortunes. Touted efforts in healthcare have 
fallen far short of expectations. Dreams of creating 
digital physician assistant which would analyze medi￾cal data and assist in diagnosis and treatment never 
got out of the development phase. Potential cancer 
treatment applications never materialized. On the AI 
front, IBM still trails rivals—Amazon, Microsoft, and 
Google—in cloud computing and AI.
The company’s missteps with Watson began with 
its focus on big and difficult initiatives (i.e., cancer 
treatment) intended to generate both acclaim and siz￾able revenue for IBM. Experts noted that while Watson 
was a remarkable achievement, it was custom-built for 
a quiz show. Applying the technology to real-world set￾tings has been problematic.
Now IBM describes Watson as a learning journey 
for the company. There have been wrong turns and 
setbacks, IBM says, but that comes with trying to com￾mercialize pioneering technology.
Beside all was not a loss. Watson is being used to 
build models and develop applications to help busi￾ness make predictions, automate processes, and inter￾act with users and customers. In 2021, IBM reported 
more than 40,000 Watson customers across 20 indus￾tries worldwide, more than double the number four 
years ago. While Watson is no longer the next big thing, 
it has evolved into a solid business for IBM.

Strategy can decide the survival of an organization. Most organizations are suc￾cessful in formulating strategies for the course(s) they should pursue. However, 
the problem in many organizations is implementing strategies—that is, making 
them happen. Integration of strategy formulation and implementation often does 
not exist.
The components of strategic management are closely linked, and all are directed 
toward the future success of the organization. Strategic management requires 
strong links among mission, goals, objectives, strategy, and implementation. The 
mission gives the general purpose of the organization. Goals give global targets 
within the mission. Objectives give specific targets to goals. Objectives give rise 
to the formulation of strategies to reach objectives. Finally, strategies require 
actions and tasks to be implemented. In most cases, the actions to be taken repre￾sent projects. Figure 2.1 shows a schematic of the strategic management process 
and major activities required.

Four Activities of the Strategic Management Process
The typical sequence of activities of the strategic management process is outlined 
here; a description of each activity then follows.
1. Review and define the organizational mission.
2. Analyze and formulate strategies.
3. Set objectives to achieve strategies.
4. Implement strategies through projects.
Review and Define the Organizational Mission
The mission identifies “what we want to become,” or the raison d’être. Mission state￾ments identify the scope of the organization in terms of its product or service. A written 
mission statement provides focus for decision making when shared by organizational 
managers and employees. Everyone in the organization should be keenly aware of the 
organization’s mission. For example, at one large consulting firm, partners who fail to 
recite the mission statement on demand are required to buy lunch. The mission state￾ment communicates and identifies the purpose of the organization to all stakeholders. 
Mission statements can be used for evaluating organization performance.
Traditional components found in mission statements are major products and services, 
target customers and markets, and geographical domain. In addition, statements frequently 
include organizational philosophy, key technologies, public image, and contribution to 
society. Including such factors in mission statements relates directly to business success.
Mission statements change infrequently. However, when the nature of the business 
changes or shifts, revised mission, and strategy statements may be required.
More specific mission statements tend to give better results because of a tighter 
focus. Mission statements decrease the chance of false directions by stakeholders. For 
example, compare the phrasing of the following mission statements:
Provide hospital design services.
Provide data mining and analysis services.
Provide information technology services.
Provide high-value products to our customers.
Clearly, the first two statements leave less chance for misinterpretation than the others. 
A rule-of-thumb test for a mission statement is that, if the statement can be anybody’s 
mission statement, it will not provide the guidance and focus intended. The mission 
sets the parameters for developing objectives.
Analyze and Formulate Strategies
Formulating strategy answers the question of what needs to be done to reach objec￾tives. Strategy formulation includes determining and evaluating alternatives that sup￾port the organization’s objectives and selecting the best alternative. The first step is a 
realistic evaluation of the past and current position of the enterprise. This step typi￾cally includes an analysis of “who are the customers” and “what are their needs as they 
(the customers) see them.”
The next step is an assessment of the internal and external environments. What are 
the internal strengths and weaknesses of the enterprise? Examples of internal strengths 
or weaknesses are core competencies, such as technology, product quality, manage￾ment talent, low debt, and dealer networks. Managers can alter internal strengths and 
weaknesses. Opportunities and threats usually represent external forces for change 
Final PDF to printer36 Chapter 2 Organization Strategy and Project Selection
lar60886_ch02_030-071.indd 36 10/14/23 11:39 am
such as technology, industry structure, and competition. Competitive benchmark￾ing tools are sometimes used to assess current and future directions. Opportunities 
and threats are the flip sides of each other. That is, a threat can be perceived as an 
opportunity, or vice versa. Examples of perceived external threats are a slowing of the 
economy, a maturing life cycle, exchange rates, and government regulation. Typical 
opportunities are increasing demand, emerging markets, and demographics. Managers 
or individual firms have limited opportunities to influence such external environmen￾tal factors; however, notable exceptions have been new technologies such as Apple 
using the iPod to create a market to sell music. The keys are to attempt to forecast 
fundamental industry changes and stay in a proactive mode rather than a reactive one. 
This assessment of the external and internal environments is known as the SWOT 
(strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis.
From this analysis, critical issues and strategic alternatives are identified. Critical 
analysis of the strategies includes asking questions: Does the strategy take advantage 
of our core competencies? Does the strategy exploit our competitive advantage? Does 
the strategy maximize meeting customers’ needs? Does the strategy fit within our 
acceptable risk range? These strategic alternatives are winnowed down to a critical 
few that support the basic mission.
Strategy formulation ends with cascading objectives or projects assigned to lower 
divisions, departments, or individuals. Formulating strategy might range around 
20 percent of management’s effort, while determining how strategy will be imple￾mented might consume 80 percent.
Set Objectives to Achieve Strategies
Objectives translate the organization strategy into specific, concrete, measurable 
terms. Organizational objectives set targets for all levels of the organization. Objec￾tives pinpoint the direction managers believe the organization should move toward. 
Objectives answer in detail where a firm is headed and when it is going to get there. 
Typically objectives for the organization cover markets, products, innovation, produc￾tivity, quality, finance, profitability, employees, and consumers. In every case, objec￾tives should be as operational as possible. That is, objectives should include a time 
frame, be measurable, be an identifiable state, and be realistic. Doran (1981) created 
the memory device shown in Exhibit 2.1, which is useful when writing objectives.
Each level below the organizational objectives should support the higher-level 
objectives in more detail; this is frequently called cascading of objectives. For example, 
if a firm making leather luggage sets an objective of achieving a 40 percent increase 
in sales through a research and development strategy, this charge is passed to the Mar￾keting, Production, and R&D Departments. The R&D Department accepts the firm’s 
strategy as their objective, and their strategy becomes the design and development of 
a new “pull-type luggage with hidden, retractable wheels.” At this point, the objective 
becomes a project to be implemented—to develop the retractable-wheel luggage for 
market within six months within a budget of $500,000. In summary, organizational 
objectives drive projects.

Implement Strategies through Projects
Implementation answers the question of how strategies will be realized, given avail￾able resources. The conceptual framework for strategy implementation lacks the 
structure and discipline found in strategy formulation. Implementation requires action 
and task completion; the latter frequently means mission-critical projects. Therefore, 
implementation must include attention to several key areas.
First, task completion requires resources. Resources typically represent funds, people, 
management talents, technological skills, and equipment. Frequently, implementation of 
projects is treated as an “addendum” rather than an integral part of the strategic manage￾ment process. However, multiple objectives place conflicting demands on organizational 
resources. Second, implementation requires a formal and informal organization that com￾plements and supports strategy and projects. Authority, responsibility, and performance 
all depend on organization structure and culture. Third, planning and control systems 
must be in place to be certain project activities necessary to ensure strategies are effec￾tively performed. Fourth, motivating project contributors will be a major factor for achiev￾ing project success. Finally, areas receiving more attention in recent years are portfolio 
management and prioritizing projects. Although the strategy implementation process is 
not as clear as strategy formulation, all managers realize that without implementation, 
success is impossible. Although the four major steps of the strategic management process 
have not been altered significantly over the years, the view of the time horizon in the 
strategy formulation process has been altered radically in the last two decades. Global 
competition, rapid innovation, and now the COVID-19 pandemic require being highly 
adaptive to short-run changes while being consistent in the longer run. See Snapshot: Is 
This the End of Airbnb? for an example of the role projects played in how a company 
persevered during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2.3 The Need for a Project Priority System
Implementation of projects without a strong priority system linked to strategy creates 
problems. Four of the most obvious problems are discussed in this section. A priority￾driven project portfolio system can go a long way to reduce, or even eliminate, the 
impact of these problems.
Problem 1: Behavioral Biases
Project selection decisions are made by people, and as human beings, they are suscep￾tible to biases. Two important human predispositions that relate to project selection 
are Optimism bias and Uniqueness bias.
Optimism bias is the tendency to be overly positive about the outcomes of planned 
activities (Kahneman, 2011). Project proponents often advocate based on an ideal 
future rather than rational assessment of gains, losses, and risks. Left on their own they 
tend to underestimate time/costs and overestimate benefits of projects. Note, this is not
deliberate, it is a human predisposition, especially true for young professionals who 
consider themselves experts.
Uniqueness bias was originally identified by psychologists as the tendency for indi￾viduals to see themselves as more singular than they actually are, for example, health￾ier or cleverer than others (c.f., Alicke & Govorun, 2005; Suis & Wan, 1987). Danish 
researcher Bent Flyvbjerg applied this bias to project selection when he tried to explain 
why organizations ignore past histories and continue to fund megaprojects (i.e., bridges, 
airports, etc.) that go way over budget (Flyvbjerg, 2014). When confronted with nega￾tive data from other similar projects, proponents argue, “but this project is different, we 
Understand the need for 
a project priority system.

When COVID-19 spread across the 
globe in 2020, the travel company 
Airbnb was in the process of register￾ing to go public. Within weeks, Airbnb 
lost 80 percent of its business. “Is this 
the end of Airbnb?” a Wired UK headline asked.
Like most businesses, Airbnb’s immediate 
response was to cut costs. Top management laid off 
25 percent of the workforce! There was also a steep 
reduction in discretionary and capital expenditures, a 
slashing of executive salaries, and a suspension of all 
facilities build-outs. In other words, hundreds of proj￾ects were canceled. Top management at Airbnb redi￾rected the remaining workforce efforts on sustaining 
their “core” business and finding innovative responses 
to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Focus on the Core Business: Co-founder Brian 
Chesky noted, “When the pandemic hit, we knew we 
couldn’t pursue everything that we used to. We chose 
to focus on what is most unique about Airbnb—our 
core business of hosting. We got back to our roots and 
back to what is truly special about Airbnb—the every￾day people who host their homes and offer experi￾ences. We scaled back investments that did not directly 
support the core of our host community.”
This move proved critical. As the pandemic deep￾ened, people were looking more at local stays and 
this played to the advantage of Airbnb. They offered 
host deep cleaning guidance and re-tooled their web￾sites to promote beachfront getaways and cabins 
tucked away in the woods. They found that people 
liked having a home all to themselves where they 
could be in their own bubble and have a kitchen to 
prepare their own food.
People also took advantage of the work atten￾dance embargo to book extended stays in attrac￾tive locales (i.e., Hawaii, Mexico) and do their work 
remotely. Airbnb supported hosts efforts at creating 
virtual workspaces for lodgers. This turned out to be 
another big factor in the turnaround.
Creatively-led Projects: Severe constraints and 
limitations can often lead to even more inspiration. 
This was certainly the case with the Airbnb project 
teams. For example, when the In-Person Experiences 
segment was suspended, this led to the creation of 
“Online Experiences.” For example, instead of meet￾ing a guide in St. Petersburg and going on an actual 
walking tour, you have a zoom meeting with a Rus￾sian guide who talks you through videos and pictures 
of the sites you would have seen. Airbnb projects 
teams worked with guides to set up and test their 
Experiences. Online Experiences turned out to be an 
extremely popular offering.
Airbnb has a long tradition providing disaster relief 
to local communities. In 2017, Airbnb launched “Open 
Homes”—a program that enabled host community to 
offer their homes for free to people impacted by disas￾ters or fleeing conflicts. Within months, Open Homes 
was housing thousands of displaced people from such 
disasters as Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Maria, and the 
earthquake in Mexico City. These were locally driven 
projects that did not have to operate in the messy envi￾ronment of a potentially deadly virus.
Airbnb redirected their energies to launching 
“Frontline Stays”—a global initiative to connect 
healthcare workers and first responders with free 
and subsidized stays during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The initiative began with two pilot projects in Italy 
and France. Within days of working with local gov￾ernments and medical officials, Airbnb announced 
that doctors, nurses, caregivers, and other medi￾cal support staff responding to the outbreak could 
have free or discounted access to accommodation 
through Airbnb.
The response was immediate and within weeks 
project teams expanded the program across the globe. 
Hosts worldwide offered more than 225,000 places 
to stay and helped accommodate tens of thousands 
of healthcare professionals, relief workers, and first 
responders.
In a large part due to their response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic crisis, Airbnb was able to launch 
a very successful initial public offering (IPO) on Decem￾ber 10, 2020. By the end of that day, the market value 
of Airbnb was $100 billion, which greatly exceeded 
market analysts’ predictions.

are different, despite what others have done, we can do this.” Flyvbjerg points out that 
by its very nature project management is susceptible to this bias since by most defini￾tion projects are “unique” (Flyvbjerg, 2021). Note again, there is no intended deception, 
rather project advocates truly believe their project is different.
Unchecked, the optimism and uniqueness biases can contribute to costly project 
decisions. This is why veteran managers, who are aware of these tendencies, need to 
be involved in selecting and prioritizing projects.
Problem 2: The Implementation Gap
In many organizations, top management formulate strategy and leave strategy imple￾mentation to functional managers. Within these broad constraints, more detailed strat￾egies and objectives are developed by the functional managers. The fact that these 
objectives and strategies are made independently at different levels by functional 
groups within the organization hierarchy causes manifold problems.
Following are some symptoms of organizations struggling with strategy disconnect 
and unclear priorities.
∙ Conflicts frequently occur among functional managers and cause lack of trust.
∙ Frequent meetings are called to establish or renegotiate priorities.
∙ People frequently shift from one project to another, depending on current priority. 
Employees are confused about which projects are important.
∙ People are working on multiple projects and feel inefficient.
∙ Resources are not adequate.
Because clear linkages do not exist between strategy and action, the organizational 
environment becomes dysfunctional, confused, and ripe for ineffective implementa￾tion of organization strategy and, thus, of projects. The implementation gap is the 
lack of understanding and consensus of organization strategy among top and middle￾level managers.
A scenario the authors have seen repeated several times follows. Top management 
pick their top 20 projects for the next planning period, without priorities. Each func￾tional department—Marketing, Finance, Operations, Engineering, Information Tech￾nology, and Human Resources—selects projects from the list. Unfortunately, 
independent department priorities across projects are not homogenous. A project that 
rates first in the IT Department can rate 10th in the Finance Department. Implementa￾tion of the projects represents conflicts of interest, with animosities developing over 
organizational resources. In a study of Deloitte Consulting, MacIntyre reports, “Only 
23 percent of nearly 150 global executives considered their project portfolios aligned 
with the core business.”2
Problem 3: Organization Politics
Politics exist in every organization and can have a significant influence on which proj￾ects receive funding and high priority. This is especially true when the criteria and 
process for selecting projects are ill-defined and not aligned with the mission of the 
firm. Project selection may be based not so much on facts and sound reasoning as on 
the persuasiveness and power of people advocating projects.
The term sacred cow is often used to denote a project that a powerful, high-ranking 
official is advocating. Case in point, a marketing consultant confided that he was once

hired by the marketing director of a large manufacturing firm to conduct an indepen￾dent, external market analysis for a new product the firm was interested in develop￾ing. His extensive research indicated that there was insufficient demand to warrant 
the financing of this new product. The marketing director chose to bury the report 
and made the consultant promise never to make the information public. The director 
explained that this new product was the “pet idea” of the new CEO, who saw it as his 
legacy to the firm. The director went on to describe the CEO’s irrational obsession 
with the project and how he referred to it as his “new baby.” Like a parent fiercely 
protecting his child, the marketing director believed that he would lose his job if such 
critical information ever became known.
Project sponsors play a significant role in the selection and successful implemen￾tation of product innovation projects. Project sponsors are typically high-ranking man￾agers who endorse and lend political support for the completion of a specific project. 
They are instrumental in winning approval of the project and in protecting the project 
during the critical development stage. The importance of project sponsors should not 
be taken lightly. For example, a PMI global survey of over 1,000 project practitioners 
and leaders over a variety of industries found those organizations having active spon￾sors on at least 80 percent of their projects/programs have a success rate of 75 percent, 
11 percentage points above the survey average of 64 percent. Many promising projects 
have failed to succeed due to lack of strong sponsorship.3
The classic example of corporate politics can be seen in the ill-fated ALTO com￾puter project at Xerox during the mid-1970s.4
 The project was a tremendous techno￾logical success; it developed the first workable mouse, the first laser printer, the first 
user-friendly software, and the first local area network. All of these developments 
were five years ahead of their nearest competitor. Over the next five years, this oppor￾tunity to dominate the nascent personal computer market was squandered because of 
internal in-fighting at Xerox and the absence of a strong project sponsor. (Apple’s 
MacIntosh computer was inspired by many of these developments.)
Politics can play a role not only in project selection but also in the aspirations 
behind projects. Individuals can enhance their power within an organization by man￾aging extraordinary and critical projects. Power and status naturally accrue to suc￾cessful innovators and risk takers rather than to steady producers. Many ambitious 
managers pursue high-profile projects as a means for moving quickly up the corporate 
ladder. Unfortunately, some devious people will deliberately distort and misrepresent 
information in order to get their projects approved (Flyvbjerg et al., 2009; Kain, 1990; 
Wachs, 1989).
Many would argue that politics and project management should not mix. A more 
proactive response is that projects and politics invariably mix and that effective project 
managers recognize that any significant project has political ramifications. Likewise, 
top management need to develop a system for identifying and selecting projects that 
reduces the impact of internal politics and fosters the selection of the best projects for 
the firm.
Problem 4: Resource Conflicts and Multitasking
Most projects operate in a multiproject environment. This environment creates the 
problems of project interdependency and the need to share resources. For example, 
what would be the impact on the labor resource pool of a construction company if it

should win a contract it would like to bid on? Will existing labor be adequate to deal 
with the new project—given the completion date? Will current projects be delayed? 
Will subcontracting help? Which projects will have priority? Competition among proj￾ect managers can be contentious. All project managers seek to have the best people for 
their projects. The problems of sharing resources and scheduling resources across proj￾ects grow exponentially as the number of projects rises. In multiproject environments, 
the stakes are higher and the benefits or penalties for good or bad resource scheduling 
become even more significant than in most single projects (Mortensen & Gardner, 2017).
Resource sharing also leads to multitasking. Multitasking involves starting and 
stopping work on one task to go and work on another project, then returning to the 
work on the original task. People working on several tasks concurrently are far less 
efficient, especially where conceptual or physical shutdown and start-up are signifi￾cant. Multitasking adds to delays and costs.
A multiproject organizational environment faces major problems without a priority 
system that is clearly linked to the strategic plan. Exhibit 2.2 lists a few key benefits of 
Project Portfolio Management; the list could easily be extended.
2.4 Project Classification
Many organizations find they have three basic kinds of projects in their portfolio: com￾pliance (emergency—must do), operational, and strategic projects (see Figure 2.2). 
Compliance projects are typically those needed to meet regulatory conditions required to 
operate in a region; hence, they are called “must do” projects. Emergency projects, such 
as building an auto parts factory destroyed by a tsunami, recovering a crashed network, or 
developing new COVID-19 vaccines are examples of must do projects. Compliance and 
emergency projects usually have penalties if they are not implemented.
Operational projects are those that are needed to support current operations. These 
projects are designed to improve the efficiency of delivery systems, reduce product 
costs, and improve performance. Some of these projects, given their limited scope and 
cost, require only immediate manager approval, while bigger, more expensive projects 
need extensive review. Choosing to install a new piece of equipment is an example of 
the latter, while modifying a production process is an example of the former. Total 
quality management (TQM) projects are examples of operational projects.
Strategic projects are those that directly support the organization’s long-run mission. 
They frequently are directed toward increasing revenue or market share. Examples of stra￾tegic projects are new products, new technologies, research, and development.5
Distinguish among three 
kinds of projects.

• Prioritizes project proposals across a common set of criteria, rather than on politics or emotion.
• Allocates resources to projects that align with strategic direction.

Frequently these three classifications are further decomposed by product type, 
organization divisions, and functions that will require different criteria for project 
selection. For example, the same criteria for the Finance or Legal Division would not 
apply to the Information Technology Department. This often requires different project 
selection criteria within the basic three classifications of strategic, operational, and 
compliance projects.
2.5 Phase Gate Model
Before we delve into the intricacies of project selection, we need to put this process in 
perspective. The selection process is the first part of the management system that spans 
the lifetime of the project. This system has been described as a series of gates that a 
project must pass through in order to be completed.6
 The purpose is to ensure that the 
organization is investing time and resources on worthwhile projects that contribute to its 
mission and strategy. Each gate is associated with a project phase and represents a deci￾sion point. A gate can lead to three possible outcomes: go (proceed), kill (cancel), or 
recycle (revise and resubmit). Figure 2.3 captures the phase gate model.
The first gate is invisible. It occurs inside the head of a person who has an idea for 
a project and must decide whether it is worth investing the time and effort to submit 
a formal proposal. This decision may be a gut reaction or involve informal research. 
Such research might include bouncing the idea off of colleagues or doing online 
research. It helps if the organization has a transparent project selection process where 
objectives and requirements for approval are well known. If not, many good ideas 
never see the light of day.
If the person believes his/her idea is worthwhile, then a project proposal is submit￾ted conforming to the selection guidelines of the firm. Project proposals, as you will 
see, include such items as project objectives, business case, estimated costs, return on 
investment, risks, and resource requirements. Beyond the basic question of whether 
the proposal makes sense, management assesses how the project outcomes will con￾tribute to the mission and strategy of the firm. For example, what strategic objectives 
does the project address? A second key question is “How well does the project fit with 
other projects?” Will it interfere with other, more important projects? Here the final 
question is whether this project is worthy of more planning.

 The original stage-gate model was pioneered by R. G. Cooper in Product Leadership: Creating and Launching Superior 
New Products (Cambridge, MA: Perseus, 2000).

If the preliminary proposal is approved, then a project manager and staff are 
assigned to develop a more comprehensive implementation plan. The preliminary pro￾posal is revised and expanded. The plan now includes detailed information regarding 
schedule, costs, resource requirements, risk management, and so forth. Not only is the 
proposal assessed again in terms of strategic importance, but the implementation plan 
is scrutinized. Does the plan make sense? Do the numbers add up? Is it worth the risk? 
How much confidence is there in the plan? If affirmative, the green light is given to 
launch the project.
Once the project is under way there will likely be one or more progress reviews. 
The main purpose of progress review is to assess performance and determine what, 
if any, adjustments should be made. In some cases, the decision is made to cancel, or 
“kill,” a project due to poor performance or lack of relevancy.

The last gate is the finish line. Here, the necessary customer acceptance has been 
achieved and management has signed off on the fulfillment of project requirements. 
This stage includes a project audit to assess project success as well as identifying key 
lessons learned.
It should be noted that this is the basic phase gate model. For many firms, projects 
will go through a series of internal escalated reviews before they obtain final approval. 
This is especially true for projects that have high risks, have high costs, and/or demand 
scarce resources. Likewise, the number of progress gates will vary depending upon 
the length and importance of the projects. For example, a three-year U.S. Department 
of Defense project will have progress reviews every six months. Finally, the described 
gate model applies to significant projects in terms of cost, resources, and/or impor￾tance. Small-scale projects do not require this level of inspection. Most often they are 
simply approved and reviewed by immediate superiors.
The remainder of this chapter focuses on gates 2 and 3, which lead to a project 
being green lighted. Performance data to assess progress are the subject of Chapter 13, 
while the final gate is addressed in Chapter 14.
2.6 Selection Criteria
Selection criteria are typically identified as financial and nonfinancial. A short 
description of each is given next, followed by a discussion of their use in practice.
Financial Criteria
For most managers, financial criteria are the preferred method to evaluate projects. 
These models are appropriate when there is a high level of confidence associated with 
estimates of future cash flows. Two models and examples are demonstrated in this 
section—payback and net present value (NPV).
Project A has an initial investment of $700,000 and projected cash inflows of 
$225,000 for 5 years.
Project B has an initial investment of $400,000 and projected cash inflows of 
$110,000 for 5 years.
1. The payback model measures the time it will take to recover the project invest￾ment. Shorter paybacks are more desirable. Payback is the simplest and most widely 
used model. Payback emphasizes cash flows, a key factor in business. Some managers 
use the payback model to eliminate unusually risky projects (those with lengthy pay￾back periods). The major limitations of payback are that it ignores the time value of 
money, assumes cash inflows for the investment period (and not beyond), and does not 
consider profitability. The payback formula is:
Payback period (yrs)= Estimated project cost/Annual savings
Exhibit 2.3A compares the payback for project A and project B. The payback for proj￾ect A is 3.1 years and for project B is 3.6 years. Using the payback method, both 
projects are acceptable, since both return the initial investment in less than five years 
and have returns on the investment of 32.1 percent and 27.5 percent. Payback provides 
especially useful information for firms concerned with liquidity and having sufficient 
resources to manage their financial obligations. 
Apply financial and nonfi￾nancial criteria to assess 
the value of projects.

2. The net present value (NPV) model uses management’s minimum desired 
rate of return (discount rate, for example, 15 percent) to compute the present value 
of all net cash inflows. If the result is positive (the project meets the minimum 
desired rate of return), it is eligible for further consideration. If the result is nega￾tive, the project is rejected. Thus, higher positive NPVs are desirable. Excel uses 
this formula:
Project NPV = I0 + ∑
t=1
n
 F _t
(1 + k)t
 
where
I0
 = Initial investment (since it is an outflow, the number will be negative)
Ft
 = Net cash inflow for period t
 k = Required rate of return
 n = number of years
Exhibit 2.3B presents the NPV model using Microsoft Excel software. The NPV 
model accepts project A, which has a positive NPV of $54,235. Project B is rejected,

since the NPV is negative $31,263. Compare the NPV results with the payback results. 
The NPV model is more realistic because it considers the time value of money, cash 
flows, and profitability. 
In the NPV model, the discount rate (return on investment [ROI] hurdle rate) can 
differ for different projects. For example, the expected ROI on strategic projects is 
frequently set higher than operational projects. Similarly, ROIs can differ for riskier 
versus safer projects. The criteria for setting the ROI hurdle rate should be clear and 
applied consistently.
Unfortunately, pure financial models fail to include many projects where financial 
return is impossible to measure and/or other factors are vital to the accept or reject 
decision. One research study by Foti (2003) showed that companies using predomi￾nantly financial models to prioritize projects yielded unbalanced portfolios and proj￾ects that were not strategically oriented.
Nonfinancial Criteria
Financial return, while important, does not always reflect strategic importance. The 
past saw firms become overextended by diversifying too much. Now the prevailing 
thinking is that long-term survival is dependent upon developing and maintaining core 
competencies. Companies have to be disciplined in saying no to potentially profitable 
projects that are outside the realm of their core mission. This requires other criteria to 
be considered beyond direct financial return. For example, a firm may support projects 
that do not have high-profit margins for other strategic reasons, including
To capture larger market share.
To make it difficult for competitors to enter the market.
To develop an enabler product, which by its introduction will increase sales in 
more profitable products.
To develop core technology that will be used in next-generation products.
To reduce dependency on unreliable suppliers.
To prevent government intervention and regulation.
Less tangible criteria may also apply. Organizations may support projects to restore 
corporate image or enhance brand recognition. Many organizations are committed to 
corporate citizenship and support community development projects.
Two Multi-Criteria Selection Models
Since no single criterion can reflect strategic significance, portfolio management 
requires multi-criteria screening models. Two models, the checklist and multi￾weighted scoring models, are described next.
Checklist Models
The most frequently used method in selecting projects has been the checklist. This 
approach basically uses a list of questions to review potential projects and to determine 
their acceptance or rejection. Several of the typical questions found in practice are 
listed in Exhibit 2.4.
A justification of checklist models is that they allow great flexibility in select￾ing among many different types of projects and are easily used across different divi￾sions and locations. Although many projects are selected using some variation of the 
checklist approach, this approach has serious shortcomings. Its major shortcomings 
are that it fails to answer the relative importance or value of a potential project to 
Understand how multi￾criteria models can be 
used to select projects.

the organization and fails to allow for comparison with other potential projects. Each 
potential project will have a different set of positive and negative answers. How do 
you compare? Ranking and prioritizing projects by their importance is difficult, if 
not impossible. This approach also leaves the door open to the potential opportunity 
for power plays, politics, and other forms of manipulation. To overcome these serious 
shortcomings, experts recommend the use of a multi-weighted scoring model to select 
projects, which is examined next.
Multi-Weighted Scoring Models
A weighted scoring model typically uses several weighted selection criteria to 
evaluate project proposals. Weighted scoring models generally include qualitative 
and/or quantitative criteria. Each selection criterion is assigned a weight. Scores 
are assigned to each criterion for the project, based on its importance to the proj￾ect being evaluated. The weights and scores are multiplied to get a total weighted 
score for the project. Using these multiple screening criteria, projects can then 
be compared using the weighted score. Projects with higher-weighted scores are 
considered better.
Selection criteria need to mirror the critical success factors of an organization. For 
example, 3M set a target that 25 percent of the company’s sales would come from 
products fewer than four years old versus the old target of 20 percent. Their priority 
system for project selection strongly reflects this new target. On the other hand, failure 
to pick the right factors will render the screening process useless in short order. See 
Snapshot from Practice 2.2: Crisis IT.
Figure 2.4 represents a project scoring matrix using some of the factors found in 
practice. The screening criteria selected are shown across the top of the matrix (e.g., 
stay within core competencies . . . ROI of 18 percent plus). Management weights each 
criterion (a value of 0 to a high of, say, 3) by its relative importance to the organiza￾tion’s objectives and strategic plan. Project proposals are then submitted to a project 
priority team or project office. 
Each project proposal is then evaluated by its relative contribution/value added to 
the selected criteria. Values of 0 to a high of 10 are assigned to each criterion for each 
project. This value represents the project’s fit to the specific criterion. For example, proj￾ect 1 appears to fit well with the strategy of the organization, since it is given a value 
of 8. Conversely, project 1 does nothing to support reducing defects (its value is 0). 
Topic Question
Strategy/alignment What specific organization strategy does this project align with?
Driver What business problem does the project solve?
Sponsorship Who is the project sponsor?
Risk What is the impact of not doing this project?
Risk How risky is the project?
Benefits, value, ROI What is the value of the project to this organization?
Benefits, value, ROI When will the project show results?
Objectives What are the project objectives?

Finally, this model applies the management weights to each criterion by impor￾tance using a value of 1 to 3. For example, ROI and strategic fit have a weight of 
3, while urgency and core competencies have weights of 2. Applying the weight to 
each criterion, the priority team derives the weighted total points for each project. 
For example, project 5 has the highest value of 102 [(2 × 1) + (3 × 10) + (2 × 5) + 
(2.5 × 10) + (1 × 0) + (1 × 8) + (3 × 9) = 102] and project 2 has a low value of 27. If 
the resources available create a cutoff threshold of 50 points, the priority team would 
eliminate projects 2 and 4. Project 5 would receive first priority, project n second, 
and so on. In rare cases where resources are severely limited and project proposals 
are similar in weighted rank, it is prudent to pick the project placing less demand on 
resources. Weighted multi-criteria models similar to this one are rapidly becoming the 
dominant choice for prioritizing projects.
In May 2007, Frontier Airlines Holdings 
hired Gerry Coady as chief informa￾tion officer (CIO). Nearly a year later 
the airline filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 11. In an interview, Coady 
describes how he managed IT projects during the 
bankruptcy and recession crisis of 2008–2009.
Fundamentally, Coady faced a situation of too 
many projects and too few resources. Coady used a 
strategy of focusing on reducing the number of proj￾ects in the portfolio. He put together a steering com￾mittee of senior management that reviewed several 
hundred projects. The end result was a reduction to 
less than 30 projects remaining in the portfolio.
HOW CAN YOU GET TO A BACKLOG OF 
OVER 100 PROJECTS?
“There are never enough resources to get everything 
done.” Backlogs build over time. Sacred cow projects 
get included in the selection system. Projects proposed 
from people who have left the airline still reside in the 
project portfolio. Non-value-added projects somehow 
make their way into the project portfolio. Soon the 
queue gets longer. With everyone in IT working on too 
many projects concurrently, project completion and 
productivity are slow.
WHICH PROJECTS REMAIN?
To cut the number of projects, the steering committee 
used a weighting scheme that reflected the airline’s 
priorities, which were fly safe, generate revenue, 
reduce costs, and customer service. The weighting 
scheme easily weeded out the fluff. Coady noted that 
“by the time you get to the 20s the margin of differen￾tiation gets narrower and narrower.” Of the remaining 
projects, project sponsors had to have solid justifica￾tion why their project was important. Reduction of the 
number of projects placed emphasis on high-value 
projects.
WHAT ADVICE DOES COADY HAVE FOR 
CRISIS MANAGEMENT?
In times of crisis, it is easier to take bold steps to make 
changes. But you need to have a clear vision of what 
you should be focusing on with the resources avail￾able. Coady suggests, “It comes back to really having a 
good idea of what the initial business case for a project 
is and what resources it is consuming, both people and 
otherwise.”

At this point in the discussion it is wise to stop and put things into perspective. 
While selection models like the one in this section may yield numeric solutions to 
project selection decisions, models should not make the final decisions—the people 
using the models should. No model, no matter how sophisticated, can capture the total 
reality it is meant to represent. Models are tools for guiding the evaluation process so 
that the decision makers will consider relevant issues and reach a meeting of the minds 
as to which projects should be supported. This is a much more subjective process than 
calculations suggest.
2.7 Applying a Selection Model
Project Classification
It is not necessary to have exactly the same criteria for the different types of proj￾ects discussed in the previous section (strategic and operations). However, experience 
shows most organizations use similar criteria across all types of projects, with perhaps 
one or two criteria specific to the type of project—for example, strategic breakthrough 
versus operational.
Regardless of criteria differences among different types of projects, the most 
important criterion for selection is the project’s fit to the organization strategy. 
Therefore, this criterion should be consistent across all types of projects and carry 
a high priority relative to other criteria. This uniformity across all priority models 
used can keep departments from suboptimizing the use of organizational resources. 
Project proposals should be classified by type so the appropriate criteria can be 
used to evaluate them.
Apply an objective prior￾ity system to project 
selection.

Selecting a Model
In the past, financial criteria were used almost to the exclusion of other criteria. 
However, in the last two decades we have witnessed a dramatic shift to include 
multiple criteria in project selection. Concisely put, profitability alone is simply 
not an adequate measure of contribution; however, it is still an important criterion, 
especially for projects that enhance revenue and market share such as breakthrough 
R&D projects.
Today, senior management are interested in identifying the potential mix of proj￾ects that will yield the best use of human and capital resources to maximize return on 
investment in the long run. Factors such as researching new technology, public image, 
ethical position, protection of the environment, core competencies, and strategic fit 
might be important criteria for selecting projects. Weighted scoring criteria seem the 
best alternative to meet this need.
Weighted scoring models result in bringing projects into closer alignment with 
strategic goals. If the scoring model is published and available to everyone in the 
organization, some discipline and credibility are attached to the selection of proj￾ects. The number of wasteful projects using resources is reduced. Politics and 
sacred cow projects are exposed. Project goals are more easily identified and com￾municated using the selection criteria as corroboration. Finally, using a weighted 
scoring approach helps project managers understand how their project was selected, 
how their project contributes to organization goals, and how it compares with other 
projects. Project selection is one of the most important decisions guiding the future 
success of an organization.
Criteria for project selection are where the power of a portfolio starts to manifest 
itself. New projects are aligned with the strategic goals of the organization. With a 
clear method in place for selecting projects, project proposals can be solicited.
Sources and Solicitation of Project Proposals
As you would guess, projects should come from anyone who believes his/her project 
will add value to the organization. However, many organizations restrict propos￾als from specific levels or groups within the organization. This could be an oppor￾tunity lost. Good ideas are not limited to certain types or classes of organization 
stakeholders.
Figure 2.5A provides an example of a proposal form for an automatic vehicular 
tracking (Automatic Vehicle Location) public transportation project. Figure 2.5B pres￾ents a preliminary risk analysis for a 500-acre wind farm. Many organizations use risk 
analysis templates to gain a quick insight into a project’s inherent risks. Risk factors 
depend on the organization and type of projects. This information is useful in balanc￾ing the project portfolio and identifying major risks when executing the project. Proj￾ect risk analysis is the subject of Chapter 7. 
In some cases, organizations will solicit ideas for projects when the knowl￾edge requirements for the project are not available in the organization. Typically 
the organization will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to contractors/vendors 
with adequate experience to implement the project. In one example, a hospital 
published an RFP that asked for a bid to design and build a new operating room 
that used the latest technology. Several architecture firms submitted bids to the 
hospital. The bids for the project were evaluated internally against other potential 
projects. When the project was accepted as a go, other criteria were used to select 
the best-qualified bidder.

fit within a portfolio of current projects. Given selection criteria and current portfolio, 
the priority team rejects or accepts the project. 
If the project is approved, a project manager and staff are assigned to develop a 
detailed implementation plan. Once completed, the proposal with implementation plan 
is reviewed a second time. Veteran project managers are assigned to the priority team. 
They draw on their experience to identify potential flaws in the plan. Strategic value 
is again assessed, but within the context of a more detailed plan. Variances between 
what was estimated in the initial proposal and final estimates based on more complete 
research/planning are examined. If significant negative differences are found (e.g., the 
initial total cost estimate was $10 million but the final estimate was $12 million, or the 
end product will no longer include a key feature), the proposal will likely be deferred 
to more senior management to decide whether the project should still be approved. 
Otherwise, the project is approved and priority assigned. Management issues a project 
charter authorizing the project manager to form a project team and secure resources to 
begin project work.

Figure 2.7 is a partial example of an evaluation form used by a large company to 
prioritize and select new projects. The form distinguishes between must and want 
objectives. If a project does not meet designated “must” objectives, it is not con￾sidered and is removed from consideration. Organization (or division) objectives 
have been ranked and weighted by their relative importance—for example, “Improve 
external customer service” carries a relative weight of 83 when compared to other 
want objectives. The want objectives are directly linked to objectives found in the 
strategic plan. 
Impact definitions represent a further refinement to the screening system. They 
are developed to gauge the predicted impact a specific project would have on meet￾ing a particular objective. A numeric scheme is created and anchored by defining 
criteria. To illustrate how this works, let’s examine the $5 million in new sales 
objective. A “0” is assigned if the project will have no impact on sales or less than 
$100,000, a “1” is given if predicted sales are more than $100,000 but less than 
$500,000, a “2” if greater than $500,000. These impact assessments are combined 
with the relative importance of each objective to determine the predicted overall 
contribution of a project to strategic objectives. For example, project 26 creates an 
opportunity to fix field problems, has no effect on sales, and will have major impact

on customer service. On these three objectives, project 26 would receive a score of 
265 [99 + 0 + (2 × 83)]. Individual weighted scores are totaled for each project and 
are used to prioritize projects.
Responsibility for Prioritizing
Senior management should be responsible for prioritizing projects. It requires more 
than a blessing. Management will need to rank and weigh, in concrete terms, the 
objectives and strategies they believe are most critical to the organization. This public 
declaration of commitment can be risky if the ranked objectives later prove to be poor 
choices, but setting the course for the organization is top management’s job. The good 
news is, if management is truly trying to direct the organization to a strong future posi￾tion, a good project priority system supports their efforts and develops a culture in 
which everyone is contributing to the goals of the organization.

2.8 Managing the Portfolio System
Managing the portfolio takes the selection system one step higher in that the merits of a 
particular project are assessed within the context of existing projects. At the same time 
it involves monitoring and adjusting selection criteria to reflect the strategic focus of the 
organization. This requires constant effort. The priority system can be managed by a small 
group of key employees in a small organization. Or in larger organizations, the priority 
system can be managed by the project office or a governance team of senior managers.
Senior Management Input
Management of a portfolio system requires two major inputs from senior management. 
First, senior management must provide guidance in establishing selection criteria that 
strongly align with the current organization strategies. Second, senior management 
must annually decide how they wish to balance the available organizational resources 
(people and capital) among the different types of projects. A preliminary decision of 
balance must be made by top management (e.g., 20 percent compliance, 50 percent 
strategic, and 30 percent operational) before project selection takes place, although the 
balance may be changed when the projects submitted are reviewed. Given these inputs 
the priority team or project office can carry out its many responsibilities, which include 
supporting project sponsors and representing the interests of the total organization.
Governance Team Responsibilities
The governance team, or project office, is responsible for publishing the priority of every 
project and ensuring the process is open and free of power politics. For example, most 
organizations using a governance team or project office use an electronic bulletin board 
to disperse the current portfolio of projects, the current status of each project, and current 
issues. This open communication discourages power plays. Over time the governance 
team evaluates the progress of the projects in the portfolio. If this whole process is man￾aged well, it can have a profound impact on the success of an organization. See Snapshot 
from Practice 2.3: Project Code Names for the rationale behind titles given to projects.
Constant scanning of the external environment to determine if organizational focus 
and/or selection criteria need to be changed is imperative. Periodic priority review and 
changes need to keep current with the changing environment and keep a unified vision 
of organization focus. If projects are classified by must do, operation, and strategic, 
each project in its class should be evaluated by the same criteria. Enforcing the project 
priority system is critical. Keeping the whole system open and aboveboard is impor￾tant to maintaining the integrity of the system and keeping new, young executives 
from going around the system.
Balancing the Portfolio for Risks and Types of Projects
A major responsibility of the priority team is to balance projects by type, risk, and 
resource demand. This requires a total organization perspective. Hence, a proposed 
project that ranks high on most criteria may not be selected because the organization 
portfolio already includes too many projects with the same characteristics—for exam￾ple, project risk level, use of key resources, high cost, non-revenue-producing, and 
long durations. Balancing the portfolio of projects is as important as selecting projects. 
Organizations need to evaluate each new project in terms of what it adds to the project 
mix. Short-term needs must be balanced with long-term potential. Resource usage 
needs to be optimized across all projects, not just the most important project.
Understand the need 
to manage the project 
portfolio.

Two types of risk are associated with projects. First are risks associated with the 
total portfolio of projects, which should reflect the organization’s risk profile. Second 
are specific project risks that can inhibit the execution of a project. In this chapter, we 
look only to balancing the organizational risks inherent in the project portfolio, such 
as market risk, ability to execute, time-to-market, and technology advances. Project￾specific risks will be covered in detail in Chapter 7.
David and Jim Matheson studied R&D organizations and developed a classifica￾tion scheme that could be used for assessing a project portfolio (see Figure 2.8).8
 They 
separated projects in terms of degree of difficulty and commercial value and came up 
with four basic types of projects:
Bread-and-butter projects are relatively easy to accomplish and produce modest 
commercial value. They typically involve evolutionary improvements to current 
products and services. Examples include software upgrades and manufacturing 
cost-reduction efforts.
Pearls are low-risk development projects with high commercial payoffs. They 
represent revolutionary commercial advances using proven technology. Examples 
include next-generation integrated circuit chips and subsurface imaging to locate 
oil and gas.

What do Yangtze, Operation Iceberg, 
and Get Blue have in common? They 
are all code names given to projects. 
Project code names are used for sev￾eral reasons:
• To uniquely identify the project within the 
organization.
Apple Corporation used to name major releases of 
MAC OS X after big cats such as Jaguar, Tiger, Pan￾ther, and Leopard but now names them after major 
California landmarks (e.g., Yosemite, Big Sur).
• To assist in maintaining secrecy of the project 
against rival concerns.
The Chamber of Secrets sequel to the Harry Pot￾ter film series was code-named “Incident of 57th 
Street” to disguise the production from its increas￾ingly rabid fan base, who would seek out filming 
locations and disrupt production.
• As a public relations tool to garner support for proj￾ect objectives.
Operation Just Cause was the name given by the 
U.S. government to the 1989 invasion of Panama, 
which ousted corrupt leader Manual Noriega.
• To inspire and elevate performance.
Revolution was used by Nintendo for its ground￾breaking Wii video game console.
Often on small projects, names convey a playful 
sense of humor. For example, a set of interrelated soft￾ware projects were all named after Smurf characters 
(Papa Smurf, Handy Smurf, Dreamy Smurf, and so on). 
Likewise, Ultraman, Sailor Moon, and Kamen Riders 
were names chosen by another set of project teams.

Oysters are high-risk, high-value projects. These projects involve technological 
breakthroughs with tremendous commercial potential. Examples include embry￾onic DNA treatments and new kinds of metal alloys.
White elephants are projects that at one time showed promise but are no longer 
viable. Examples include products for a saturated market and a potent energy 
source with toxic side effects.
The Mathesons report that organizations often have too many white elephants and 
too few pearls and oysters. To maintain strategic advantage, they recommend that 
organizations capitalize on pearls, eliminate or reposition white elephants, and balance 
resources devoted to bread-and-butter and oyster projects to achieve alignment with 
overall strategy. Although their research centers on R&D organizations, their observa￾tions appear to hold true for all types of project organizations.

Summary Multiple competing projects, limited skilled resources, dispersed virtual teams, time￾to-market pressures, and limited capital serve as forces for the emergence of project 
portfolio management that provides the infrastructure for managing multiple projects 
and linking business strategy with project selection. The most important element of 
this system is the creation of a ranking system that utilizes multiple, weighted criteria 
that reflect the mission and strategy of the firm. It is critical to communicate priority 
criteria to all organizational stakeholders so that the criteria can be the source of inspi￾ration for new project ideas.
Every significant project selected should be ranked and the results published. Senior 
management must take an active role in setting priorities and supporting the priority 
system. Going around the priority system will destroy its effectiveness. Project review 
boards need to include seasoned managers who are capable of asking tough ques￾tions and distinguishing facts from fiction. Resources (people, equipment, and capital) 
for major projects must be clearly allocated and not conflict with daily operations or 
become an overload task.

The governance team needs to scrutinize significant projects in terms of not only 
their strategic value but also their fit with the portfolio of projects currently being 
implemented. Highly ranked projects may be deferred or even turned down if they 
upset the current balance among risks, resources, and strategic initiatives. Project 
selection must be based not only on the merits of the specific project but also on what 
it contributes to the current project portfolio mix. This requires a holistic approach to 
aligning projects with organization strategy and resources.
1. Describe the major components of the strategic management process.
2. Explain the role projects play in the strategic management process.
3. How are projects linked to the strategic plan?
4. The portfolio of projects is typically represented by compliance, strategic, and 
operations projects. What impact can this classification have on project 
selection?
5. Why does the priority system described in this chapter require that it be open and 
published? Does the process encourage bottom-up initiation of projects? Does it 
discourage some projects? Why?
6. Why should an organization not rely only on ROI to select projects?
7. Discuss the pros and cons of the checklist versus the weighted factor method of 
selecting projects.

1. You manage a hotel resort located on the South Beach on the Island of Kauai in 
Hawaii. You are shifting the focus of your resort from a traditional fun-in-the-sun 
destination to eco-tourism. (Eco-tourism focuses on environmental awareness and 
education.) How would you classify the following projects in terms of compli￾ance, strategic, and operational?
a. Convert the pool heating system from electrical to solar power.
b. Build a four-mile nature hiking trail.
c. Renovate the horse barn.
d. Launch a new promotional campaign with Hawaii Airlines.
e. Convert 12 adjacent acres into a wildlife preserve.
f. Update all the bathrooms in condos that are 10 years old or older.
g. Change hotel brochures to reflect eco-tourism image.
h. Test and revise disaster response plan based on new requirements.
How easy was it to classify these projects? What made some projects more diffi￾cult than others? What do you think you now know that would be useful for man￾aging projects at the hotel?
2. Two new software projects are proposed to a young, start-up company.* The 
Alpha project will cost $150,000 to develop and is expected to have an annual net 
cash flow of $40,000. The Beta project will cost $200,000 to develop and is 
expected to have an annual net cash flow of $50,000. The company is very con￾cerned about their cash flow. Using the payback period, which project is better 
from a cash flow standpoint? Why?
3. A five-year project has a projected net cash flow of $15,000, $25,000, $30,000, 
$20,000, and $15,000 in the next five years. It will cost $50,000 to implement the 
project. If the required rate of return is 20 percent, conduct a discounted cash flow 
calculation to determine the NPV.
4. You work for the 3T company, which expects to earn at least 18 percent on its 
investments. You have to choose between two similar projects. The following 
chart shows the cash information for each project. Which of the two projects 
would you fund if the decision were based only on financial information? Why?

 Case 2.1
Hector Gaming Company
Hector Gaming Company (HGC) is an educational gaming company specializing in 
young children’s educational games. HGC has just completed their fourth year of 
operation. This year was a banner year for HGC. The company received a large 
influx of capital for growth by issuing stock privately through an investment bank￾ing firm. It appears the return on investment for this past year will be just over 25 
percent with zero debt! The growth rate for the last two years has been approxi￾mately 80 percent each year. Parents and grandparents of young children have been 
buying HGC’s products almost as fast as they are developed. Every member of the 
56-person firm is enthusiastic and looking forward to helping the firm grow to be 
the largest and best educational gaming company in the world. The founder of the 
firm, Sally Peters, has been written up in Young Entrepreneurs as “the young entre￾preneur to watch.” She has been able to develop an organizational culture in which 
all stakeholders are committed to innovation, continuous improvement, and organi￾zation learning.
Last year, 10 top managers of HGC worked with McKinley Consulting to develop 
the organization’s strategic plan. This year the same 10 managers had a retreat in 
Aruba to formulate next year’s strategic plan using the same process suggested 
by McKinley Consulting. Most executives seem to have a consensus of where the 
firm should go in the intermediate and long term. But there is little consensus on 
how this should be accomplished. Peters, now president of HGC, feels she may 
be losing control. The frequency of conflicts seems to be increasing. Some indi￾viduals are always requested for any new project created. When resource conflicts 
occur among projects, each project manager believes his or her project is most 
important. More projects are not meeting deadlines and are coming in over budget. 
Yesterday’s management meeting revealed some top HGC talent have been work￾ing on an international business game for college students. This project does not 
fit the organization vision or market niche. At times it seems everyone is marching 
to his or her own drummer. Somehow more focus is needed to ensure everyone 
agrees on how strategy should be implemented, given the resources available to 
the organization.
Yesterday’s meeting alarmed Peters. These emerging problems are coming at a 
bad time. Next week HGC is ramping up the size of the organization, number of 
new products per year, and marketing efforts. Fifteen new people will join HGC 
next month. Peters is concerned that policies be in place that will ensure the new 
people are used most productively. An additional potential problem looms on the 
horizon. Other gaming companies have noticed the success HGC is having in their 
niche market; one company tried to hire a key product development employee away 
from HGC. Peters wants HGC to be ready to meet any potential competition head 
on and to discourage any new entries into their market. Peters knows HGC is project 
driven; however, she is not as confident that she has a good handle on how such an 
organization should be managed—especially with such a fast growth rate and poten￾tial competition closer to becoming a reality. The magnitude of emerging problems 
demands quick attention and resolution.
Peters has hired you as a consultant. She has suggested the following format for 
your consulting contract. You are free to use another format if it will improve the 
effectiveness of the consulting engagement.

 Case 2.2
Film Prioritization
The purpose of this case is to give you experience in using a project priority system 
that ranks proposed projects by their contribution to the organization’s objectives and 
strategic plan.
COMPANY PROFILE
The company is the film division for a large entertainment conglomerate. The main 
office is located in Anaheim, California. In addition to the feature film division, the 
conglomerate includes theme parks, home videos, a television channel, interactive 
games, and theatrical productions. The company has been enjoying steady growth over 
the past 10 years. Last year total revenues increased by 12 percent to $32.2 billion. 
The company is engaged in negotiations to expand its theme park empire to mainland 
China and Poland. The film division generated $376 million in revenues, which was an 
increase of 7 percent over the past year. Profit margin was down 3 percent to 16 percent 
because of the poor response to three of the five major film releases for the year.
COMPANY MISSION
The mission for the firm is as follows:
Our overriding objective is to create shareholder value by continuing to be the world’s pre￾mier entertainment company from a creative, strategic, and financial standpoint.
The film division supports this mission by producing four to six high-quality, family 
entertainment films for mass distribution each year. In recent years, the CEO of the 
company has advocated that the firm take a leadership position in championing envi￾ronmental concerns.
COMPANY “MUST” OBJECTIVES
Every project must meet the must objectives as determined by executive management. 
It is important that selected film projects not violate such objectives of high strategic 
priority. There are three must objectives:
1. All projects meet current legal, safety, and environmental standards.
2. All film projects should receive a PG or lower advisory rating.
3. All projects should not have an adverse effect on current or planned operations 
within the larger company.
COMPANY “WANT” OBJECTIVES
Want objectives are assigned weights for their relative importance. Top management is 
responsible for formulating, ranking, and weighting objectives to ensure that projects 
What is our major problem?

FUND RAISING PROJECT
Assume you are a member of a class on project management. Each student will join 
a team of five to seven students who will be responsible for creating, planning, and 
executing a fund raising project for a designated charity. The fund raising project has 
two goals: (1) raise money for a worthy cause and (2) provide an opportunity for all 
team members to practice project management skills and techniques.
In addition to completing the project, a number of deliverables are required to com￾plete this assignment. These deliverables include
 a. Project proposal
b. Implementation plan
c. Risk management plan
d. Status report
e. Project reflections presentation
f. Project retrospective/audit
Approved projects will receive $400 seed money to be reimbursed upon completion 
of the project.
“MUST” OBJECTIVES
Every project must meet the “must” objectives as determined by the instructor. There 
are four must objectives:
1. All projects must be safe, be legal, and comply with university policies.
2. All projects must be capable of earning at least $1,000.
3. All projects must be able to be completed within nine weeks.
4. All projects must provide an opportunity for every member of the project team to 
experience and learn about project management.
Among the factors to consider for the last objective are the extent to which there is 
meaningful work for every member of the team, the degree of coordination required, 
the extent to which the team will have to work with external stakeholders, and the 
complexity of the project.
“WANT” OBJECTIVES
In addition to the must objectives, there are “want” objectives that the instructor would 
like to achieve.
1. Earn more than $1,000 for a charity.
2. Increase public awareness of the charity.
3. Provide a resume-worthy experience for students.
4. Be featured on local TV news.
5. Be fun to do.

Peter F. Drucker, renown management thinker.
Once management approves a project, then the question becomes, how will the project 
be implemented? This chapter examines three different project management structures 
used by firms to implement projects: functional organization, dedicated project teams, 
and matrix structure. Although not exhaustive, these structures and their variant forms 
represent the major approaches for organizing projects. The advantages and disadvan￾tages of each of these structures are discussed as well as some of the critical factors 
that might lead a firm to choose one form over others.
Whether a firm chooses to complete projects within the traditional functional organi￾zation or through some form of matrix arrangement is only part of the story. Anyone who 
has worked for more than one organization realizes that there are often considerable dif￾ferences in how projects are managed within certain firms even with similar structures. 
Working in a matrix system at AT&T is different from working in a matrix environment 
at Hewlett Packard. Many researchers attribute these differences to the organizational 
culture at AT&T and Hewlett Packard. A simple explanation of organizational culture is 
that it reflects the “personality” of an organization. Just as each individual has a unique 
personality, so each organization has a unique culture. Toward the end of this chapter, we 
examine in more detail what organizational culture is and the impact that the culture of 
the parent organization has on organizing and managing projects.
Both the project management structure and the culture of the organization 
constitute major elements of the enterprise environment in which projects are imple￾mented.1 It is important for project managers and participants to know the “lay of the 
land” so that they can avoid obstacles and take advantage of pathways to complete 
their projects.

 In addition to culture and structure, environmental factors also include geographical distribution, resource availability, 
IT capabilities, and the like.

3.1 Project Management Structures
A project management system provides a framework for launching and implement￾ing project activities within a parent organization. A good system appropriately 
balances the needs of both the parent organization and the project by defining the 
interface between the project and parent organization in terms of authority, alloca￾tion of resources, and eventual integration of project outcomes into mainstream 
operations. With this in mind, we will start the discussion of project management 
structures.
Organizing Projects within the Functional Organization
One approach to organizing projects is to simply manage them within the existing 
functional hierarchy of the organization. Once management decides to implement 
a project, the different segments of the project are delegated to the respective func￾tional units with each unit responsible for completing its segment of the project (see 
Figure 3.1). Coordination is maintained through normal management channels. For 
example, a tool manufacturing firm decides to differentiate its product line by offer￾ing a series of tools specially designed for left-handed individuals. Top management 
decides to implement the project, and different segments of the project are distributed 
to appropriate areas. The Industrial Design Department is responsible for modifying 
specifications to conform to the needs of left-handed users. The Production Depart￾ment is responsible for devising the means for producing new tools according to these 
new design specifications. The Marketing Department is responsible for gauging 
demand and price as well as identifying distribution outlets. The overall project will 
be managed within the normal hierarchy, with the project being part of the working 
agenda of top management. 
The functional organization is also commonly used when, given the nature of the 
project, one functional area plays a dominant role in completing the project or has a 
dominant interest in the success of the project. Under these circumstances, a high￾ranking manager in that area is given the responsibility of coordinating the project. For 
example, the transfer of equipment and personnel to a new office would be managed 
by a top-ranking manager in the firm’s Facilities Department. Likewise, a project 
involving the upgrading of the management information system would be managed by 
the Information Systems Department. In both cases, most of the project work would be 
done within the specified department, and coordination with other departments would 
occur through normal channels.
There are advantages and disadvantages for using the existing functional organiza￾tion to administer and complete projects (Larson, 2004). The major advantages are the 
following:
1. No change. Projects are completed within the basic functional structure of the par￾ent organization. There is no radical alteration in the design and operation of the 
parent organization.
2. Flexibility. There is maximum flexibility in the use of staff. Appropriate specialists 
in different functional units can temporarily be assigned to work on the project and 
then return to their normal work. With a broad base of technical personnel available 
within each functional department, people can be switched among different proj￾ects with relative ease.

3. In-depth expertise. If the scope of the project is narrow and the proper functional 
unit is assigned primary responsibility, then in-depth expertise can be brought to 
bear on the most crucial aspects of the project.
4. Easy post-project transition. Normal career paths within a functional division 
are maintained. While specialists can make significant contributions to projects, 
their functional field is their professional home and the focus of their professional 
growth and advancement.
Just as there are advantages for organizing projects within the existing functional 
organization, there are also disadvantages. These disadvantages are particularly pro￾nounced when the scope of the project is broad and one functional department does 
not take the dominant technological and managerial lead on the project:
1. Lack of focus. Each functional unit has its own core routine work to do; sometimes 
project responsibilities get pushed aside to meet primary obligations. This diffi￾culty is compounded when the project has different priorities for different units. For 
example, the Marketing Department may consider the project urgent but the opera￾tions people consider it only of secondary importance. Imagine the tension if the 
marketing people have to wait for the operations people to complete their segment 
of the project before they proceed.
2. Poor integration. There may be poor integration across functional units. Func￾tional specialists tend to be concerned only with their segment of the project and 
not with what is best for the total project.
3. Slow. It generally takes longer to complete projects through this functional arrange￾ment. This is in part attributable to slow response time—project information and 
decisions have to be circulated through normal management channels. Furthermore, 
the lack of horizontal, direct communication among functional groups contributes 
to rework as specialists realize the implications of others’ actions after the fact.
4. Lack of ownership. The motivation of people assigned to the project can be weak. 
The project may be seen as an additional burden that is not directly linked to their 
professional development or advancement. Furthermore, because they are working 
on only a segment of the project, professionals do not identify with the project.
Organizing Projects as Dedicated Teams
At the other end of the structural spectrum is the creation of a dedicated project 
team. These teams operate as units separate from the rest of the parent organization. 
Usually, a full-time project manager is designated to pull together a core group of 
specialists who work full time on the project. The project manager recruits necessary 
personnel from both within and outside the parent company. The subsequent team is 
physically separated from the parent organization and given marching orders to com￾plete the project (see Figure 3.2).
The interface between the parent organization and the project teams will vary. 
In some cases, the parent organization maintains a tight rein through financial con￾trols. In other cases, firms grant the project manager maximum freedom to get the 
project done as s/he sees fit. Lockheed Martin has used this approach to develop 
next-generation jet airplanes. See Snapshot from Practice 3.1: Skunk Works at 
Lockheed Martin.
In the case of firms where projects are the dominant form of business, such as a 
construction firm or a consulting firm, the entire organization is designed to support

project teams. Instead of one or two special projects, the organization consists of 
sets of quasi-independent teams working on specific projects. The main responsibil￾ity of traditional functional departments is to assist and support these project teams. 
For example, the Marketing Department is directed at generating new business that 
will lead to more projects, while the Human Resource Department is responsible 
for managing a variety of personnel issues as well as recruiting and training new 
employees. This type of organization is referred to in the literature as a projectized 
organization and is graphically portrayed in Figure 3.3. It is important to note that 
not all projects are dedicated project teams; personnel can work part time on several 
projects.
As in the case of functional organization, the dedicated project team approach 
has strengths and weaknesses (Larson, 2004). The following are recognized as 
strengths:
1. Simple. Other than taking away resources in the form of specialists assigned to the 
project, the functional organization remains intact with the project team operating 
independently.
In project management folklore, 
skunk works is code for a small, 
dedicated team assigned to a break￾through project. The first skunk 
works were created more than half 
a century ago by Clarence L. “Kelly” Johnson at 
Lockheed Aerospace Corporation. Kelly’s project 
had two objectives: (1) to create a jet fighter, the 
Shooting Star, and (2) to do it as fast as possible. 
Kelly and a small band of engineering mavericks 
operated as a dedicated team unencumbered by 
red tape and the bureaucratic delays of the normal 
R&D process. The name was coined by team mem￾ber Irvin Culver after the moonshine brewery deep 
in the forest in the popular cartoon strip Lil’Abner. 
The homemade whisky was euphemistically called 
kickapoo joy juice.
The project was a spectacular success. In just 
43  days, Johnson’s team of 23 engineers and teams 
of support personnel put together the first American 
fighter to fly at more than 500 miles per hour. Lock￾heed, like others, found that the management systems 
necessary to run a large manufacturing operation are 
not conducive to innovation. Instead, they choose to 
use agile dedicated teams that act as a well-funded 
start-up.
Lockheed has continued to use skunk works to 
develop a string of high-speed jets, including the F117

2. Fast. Projects tend to get done more quickly when participants devote their full 
attention to the project and are not distracted by other obligations and duties. Fur￾thermore, response time tends to be quicker under this arrangement because most 
decisions are made within the team and are not deferred up the hierarchy.
3. Cohesive. A high level of motivation and cohesiveness often emerges within the 
project team. Participants share a common goal and personal responsibility toward 
the project and the team.
4. Cross-functional integration. Specialists from different areas work closely 
together and, with proper guidance, become committed to optimizing the project, 
not their respective areas of expertise.
In many cases, the project team approach is the optimum approach for completing a 
project when you view it solely from the standpoint of what is best for completing 
the project. Its weaknesses become more evident when the needs of the parent organi￾zation are taken into account:
1. Expensive. Not only have you created a new management position (project man￾ager), but resources are also assigned on a full-time basis. This can result in dupli￾cation of efforts across projects and a loss of economies of scale.
2. Internal strife. Sometimes dedicated project teams become an entity in their own 
right and conflict emerges between the team and the remainder of the organization

(see Snapshot from Practice 3.2: The Birth of the Mac). This divisiveness can under￾mine not only the integration of the eventual outcomes of the project into main￾stream operations but also the assimilation of project team members back into their 
functional units once the project is completed.
One of the advantages of creating 
dedicated project teams is that project 
participants from different functional 
areas can develop into a highly cohe￾sive work team that is strongly com￾mitted to completing the project. While such teams 
often produce Herculean efforts in pursuit of project 
completion, there is a negative dimension to this com￾mitment that is often referred to in the literature as 
projectitis.
A we–they attitude can emerge between proj￾ect team members and the rest of the organization. 
The project team succumbs to hubris and develops 
a holier-than-thou attitude that antagonizes the par￾ent organization. People not assigned to the project 
become jealous of the attention and prestige being 
showered on the project team, especially when 
they believe that it is their hard work that is financ￾ing the endeavor. The tendency to assign project 
teams exotic titles such as “Silver Bullets” and “Tiger 
Teams,” as well as to give them special perks, tends 
to intensify the gap between the project team and 
the rest of the organization.
Such appears to have been the case with Apple’s 
highly successful Macintosh development team. 
Steve Jobs, who at the time was both the chairper￾son of Apple and the project manager for the Mac 
team, pampered his team with perks, including at￾the-desk massages, coolers stocked with freshly 
squeezed orange juice, a Bosendorfer grand piano, 
and first-class plane tickets. No other employees at 
Apple got to travel first class. Jobs considered his 
team to be the elite of Apple and had a tendency 
to refer to everyone else as “Bozos” who “didn’t 
get it.” Engineers from the Apple  II division, which 
was the bread and butter of Apple’s sales, became 
incensed with the special treatment their colleagues 
were getting.
One evening at Ely McFly’s, a local watering hole, 
the tensions between Apple II engineers seated at 
one table and those of a Mac team at another boiled 
over. Aaron Goldberg, a long-time industry consul￾tant, watched from his barstool as the squabbling 
escalated. “The Mac guys were screaming, ‘We’re 
the future!’ The Apple II guys were screaming, ‘We’re 
the money!’ Then there was a geek brawl. Pocket 
protectors and pens were flying. I was waiting for a 
notebook to drop, so they would stop and pick up 
the papers.”
Although comical from a distance, the discord 
between the Apple II and Mac groups severely ham￾pered Apple’s performance during the 1980s. John 
Sculley, who replaced Steve Jobs as chairperson of 
Apple, observed that Apple had evolved into two “war￾ring companies” and referred to the street between the 
Apple II and Macintosh buildings as “the DMZ” (demili￾tarized zone).

3. Limited technological expertise. Creating self-contained teams inhibits maxi￾mum technological expertise being brought to bear on problems. Technical 
expertise is limited somewhat to the talents and experience of the specialists 
assigned to the project. While nothing prevents specialists from consulting 
with others in the functional division, the we–they syndrome and the fact that 
such help is not formally sanctioned by the organization discourage this from 
happening.
4. Difficult post-project transition. Assigning full-time personnel to a project cre￾ates the dilemma of what to do with them after the project is completed. If other 
project work is not available, then the transition back to their original functional 
departments may be difficult because of their prolonged absence and the need to 
catch up with recent developments in their functional area.
Organizing Projects within a Matrix Arrangement
Matrix management is a hybrid organizational form in which a horizontal project 
management structure is “overlaid” on the normal functional hierarchy. In a matrix 
system, there are usually two chains of command, one along functional lines and the 
other along project lines. Instead of delegating segments of a project to different units 
or creating an autonomous team, project participants report simultaneously to both 
functional and project managers.
Companies apply this matrix arrangement in a variety of ways. Some orga￾nizations set up temporary matrix systems to deal with specific projects, whereas 
“matrix” may be a permanent fixture in other organizations. Let us first look at its 
general application and then proceed to a more detailed discussion of finer points. 
Consider Figure 3.4. There are three projects currently under way: A, B, and C. All 
three project managers (PM A–C) report to a director of project management, who 
supervises all projects. Each project has an administrative assistant, although the one 
for project C is only part time. 
Project A involves the design and expansion of an existing production line 
to accommodate new metal alloys. To accomplish this objective, project A has 
assigned to it 3.5 people from Manufacturing and 6 people from Engineering. 
These individuals are assigned to the project on a part-time or full-time basis, 
depending on the project’s needs during various phases of the project. Project B 
involves the development of a new product that requires the heavy representa￾tion of Engineering, Manufacturing, and Marketing. Project C involves forecasting 
changing needs of an existing customer base. While these three projects, as well 
as others, are being completed, the functional divisions continue performing their 
basic, core activities.
The matrix structure is designed to utilize resources optimally by having indi￾viduals work on multiple projects as well as being capable of performing normal 
functional duties. At the same time, the matrix approach attempts to achieve greater 
integration by creating and legitimizing the authority of a project manager. In the￾ory, the matrix approach provides a dual focus between functional/technical exper￾tise and project requirements that is missing in either the project team or functional 
approach to project management. This focus can most easily be seen in the rela￾tive input of functional managers and project managers over key project decisions 
(see Table 3.1).

Different Matrix Forms
In practice there are really different kinds of matrix systems, depending on the rela￾tive authority of the project and functional managers (Bowen et al., 1994; Larson & 
Gobeli, 1987). Here is a thumbnail sketch of the three kinds of matrices:
∙ Weak matrix. This form is very similar to a functional approach with the exception 
that there is a formally designated project manager responsible for coordinating 
project activities. Functional managers are responsible for managing their segment 
of the project. The project manager basically acts as a staff assistant who draws 
the schedules and checklists, collects information on the status of work, and facili￾tates project completion. The project manager has indirect authority to expedite and 
monitor the project. Functional managers call most of the shots and decide who 
does what and when the work is completed.
∙ Balanced matrix. This is the classic matrix, in which the project manager is respon￾sible for defining what needs to be accomplished, while the functional managers are 
concerned with how it will be accomplished. More specifically, the project manager 
establishes the overall plan for completing the project, integrates the contribution 
of the different disciplines, sets schedules, and monitors progress. The functional 
managers are responsible for assigning personnel and executing their segment of 
the project according to the standards and schedules set by the project manager. The 
merger of “what and how” requires both parties to work closely together and jointly 
approve technical and operational decisions.
∙ Strong matrix. This form attempts to create the “feel” of a project team within a 
matrix environment. The project manager controls most aspects of the project, includ￾ing scope trade-offs and assignment of functional personnel. The project manager 
controls when and what specialists do and has final say on major  project deci￾sions. The functional manager has title over his or her people and is consulted on 
a need basis. In some situations, a functional manager’s department may serve 
as a “subcontractor” for the project, in which case it has more control over special￾ized work. For example, the development of a new series of laptop computers may 
require a team of experts from different disciplines working on the basic design and 
performance requirements within a project matrix arrangement. Once the specifica￾tions have been determined, final design and production of certain components (e.g., 
power source) may be assigned to respective functional groups to complete.
Matrix management, both in general and in its specific forms, has unique strengths and 
weaknesses (Larson & Gobeli, 1987). The advantages and disadvantages of matrix 
organizations in general are noted in the following list, which only briefly highlights 
the specifics concerning different forms.

structures and under￾stand their strengths

1. Efficient. Resources can be shared across multiple projects as well as within func￾tional divisions. Individuals can divide their energy among multiple projects on an 
as-needed basis. This reduces the duplication required in a projectized structure.
2. Strong project focus. A stronger project focus is provided by having a formally 
designated project manager who is responsible for coordinating and integrating 
contributions of different units. This helps sustain a holistic approach to problem 
solving that is often missing in the functional organization.
3. Easier post-project transition. Because the project organization is overlaid on the 
functional divisions, specialists maintain ties with their functional group, so they 
have a homeport to return to once the project is completed.
4. Flexible. Matrix arrangements provide for flexible utilization of resources and 
expertise within the firm. In some cases, functional units provide individuals who 
are managed by the project manager. In other cases, the contributions are monitored 
by the functional manager.
The strengths of the matrix structure are considerable. Unfortunately, so are the poten￾tial weaknesses. This is due in large part to the fact that a matrix structure is more 
complicated and the creation of multiple bosses represents a radical departure from the 
traditional hierarchical authority system.
Furthermore, one does not install a matrix structure overnight. Experts argue that it 
takes three to five years for a matrix system to fully mature, so many of the following 
problems represent growing pains.
1. Dysfunctional conflict. The matrix approach is predicated on tension between func￾tional managers and project managers who bring critical expertise and perspectives 
to the project. Such tension is viewed as a necessary mechanism for achieving an 
appropriate balance between complex technical issues and unique project require￾ments. While the intent is noble, the effect is sometimes analogous to opening 
Pandora’s box. Legitimate conflict can spill over to a more personal level, resulting 
from conflicting agendas and accountabilities. Worthy discussions can degenerate 
into heated arguments that engender animosity among the managers involved.
2. Infighting. Any situation in which equipment, resources, and people are being 
shared across projects and functional activities lends itself to conflict and competi￾tion for scarce resources. Infighting can occur among project managers, who are 
primarily interested in what is best for their project.
3. Stressful. Matrix management violates the management principle of unity of com￾mand. Project participants have at least two bosses—their functional head and 
one or more project managers. Working in a matrix environment can be extremely 
stressful. Imagine working in an environment in which you are being told to do 
three conflicting things by three different managers.
4. Slow. In theory, the presence of a project manager to coordinate the project should 
accelerate its completion. In practice, however, decision making can get bogged 
down, as agreements have to be forged across multiple functional groups. This is 
especially true for the balanced matrix.
When the three variant forms of the matrix approach are considered, we can see that 
advantages and disadvantages are not necessarily true for all three forms of matrix. The 
strong matrix is likely to enhance project integration, diminish internal power struggles, 
and ultimately improve control of project activities and costs. On the downside, technical 
quality may suffer because functional areas have less control over their contributions. 
Finally, projectitis may emerge as the members develop a strong team identity.

The weak matrix is likely to improve technical quality as well as provide a better 
system for managing conflict across projects because the functional manager assigns 
personnel to different projects. The problem is that functional control is often main￾tained at the expense of poor project integration. The balanced matrix can achieve bet￾ter balance between technical and project requirements, but it is a very delicate system 
to manage and is more likely to succumb to many of the problems associated with the 
matrix approach.
3.2 Project Management Office (PMO)
A project management office (PMO)2
 is a centralized unit within an organization or 
a department that oversees and supports the execution of projects. PMOs emerged in 
response to the poor track record many companies experienced in finishing projects on 
time, within budget, and according to plan. Organizations began to devote staff to 
support and improve project implementation. Often PMOs played a critical role in 
helping matrix systems mature into more effective project delivery platforms. A 2022 
study showed that 79 percent of U.S. organizations reported having a PMO (Cabanis￾Brewin, 2022).
PMOs come in many different forms. In a small organization with few projects, 
the PMO may consist of just one professional assigned to support project efforts. In 
large, multinational firms, PMOs may involve hundreds, even thousands, of profes￾sionals operating at different levels and in different parts of the organization. Since 
2003 the Project Management Institute (PMI) has recognized a PMO of the Year. 
Snapshot from Practice 3.3: 2018 PMO of the Year details the 2018 recipient. Sub￾sequent Snapshot from Practice 2021 PMO of the Year features the 2021 recipient 
(Moffitt Cancer Center).
One interesting way of characterizing different kinds of PMOs has been set forth 
by Casey & Peck (2001), who describe certain PMOs in terms of being (1) a weather 
station, (2) a control tower, or (3) a resource pool. We have added a fourth kind, a 
command and control center that reflects recent developments. Each of these models 
performs a very different function within an organization.
∙ Weather station. The primary function of the weather station PMO is to track and 
monitor project performance. It is typically created to satisfy top management’s 
need to stay on top of the portfolio of projects under way in the firm. Staff provides 
an independent forecast of project performance. The questions answered for spe￾cific projects include
How are our projects progressing? Which ones are on track? Which ones are not?
How are we doing in terms of cost? Which projects are over or under budget?
What are the major problems confronting projects? Are contingency plans in place? 
What can the organization do to help the project?
∙ Control tower. The primary function of the control tower PMO is to improve proj￾ect execution. It considers project management as a profession to be protected and 
advanced. Staff at the PMO identify best practices and standards for project manage￾ment excellence. They work as consultants and trainers to support project managers 
and their teams.

From mobile networks to home Inter￾net to pay TV, Telstra, Australia’s 
largest telecom company, invests 
heavily in projects. In 2012, Telstra 
commissioned an assessment of how 
well the company managed large, strategic projects. 
The results were not good: roughly 30 percent of its 
investment programs and projects were not meeting 
its goals.
In response, Telstra launched the Capital Planning & 
Delivery Project Management Office (PMO) as a dedi￾cated capability within the finance and strategy function 
of the firm. The PMO’s overarching goal was to instill 
discipline around strategic capital planning and improve 
the overall effectiveness of the company’s capital invest￾ment management. The PMO now includes 24 full-time 
staff overseeing a portfolio of 1,265 projects worldwide 
with an annual value of more than AU$3.77 billion.
The PMO team has implemented an enterprise-wide 
portfolio management system to track and improve 
ROI on all invested capital. At the outset of each major 
project, the PMO works with responsible managers to 
develop key performance indicators (KPIs) that outline 
how the project will contribute to Telstra’s strategic mis￾sion. These KPIs are used on a monthly basis to moni￾tor project performance and raise flags when slippage 
begins to occur. The PMO has the authority to shut 
down underperforming projects. The PMO also provides 
sponsors and managers with the necessary training to 
support successful project management. These efforts 
have paid off. In 2017, more than 75 percent of projects 
scored above benchmarks for schedule, budget, and 
quality. The PMO also helped Telstra save over AU$220 
million over three years, thanks to a rigorous go/no-go 
stage-gate process.
“We’ve been able to ensure that the best projects 
with the best returns have been prioritized and exe￾cuted with the right people,” Rob Loader, one of the 
PMO staff members says. “That allows us to be first 
to market on specific initiatives in a very competitive 
environment.”

∙ Resource pool. The goal of the resource pool PMO is to provide the organization 
with a cadre of trained project managers and professionals. It operates like an acad￾emy for continually upgrading the skills of a firm’s project professionals. In addi￾tion to training, this kind of PMO also elevates the stature of project management 
within the organization.
∙ Command and control center. Unlike the support function performed by the other 
kinds of PMO, this type has direct authority over projects. It acts as a key decision 
maker across the life of a project, making sure the project is aligned with business 
objectives and conforms to accepted practices. Such PMOs make recommenda￾tions, approve significant changes, and even terminate projects.
Today most PMOs take on more than one of these roles. For example, a PMO may 
track projects, provide training, and institutionalize lessons learned. In recent years, 
PMOs have played a key role in helping organizations adapt Agile methods to their 
projects (Patel, 2018).
PMOs will continue to evolve and adapt. It is important to remember that the 
primary role of a PMO is to facilitate/enable projects, not do projects. Top man￾agement should not allow a PMO to usurp the technical aspects (scheduling, plan￾ning, budgeting, etc.) of completing a project. Those are the project manager’s 
responsibilities.

The Project Management Office (PMO) 
of the year award is intended to rec￾ognize individuals working in a PMO 
that has demonstrated superior project 
management abilities by adding value 
to its organization through its support of successful stra￾tegic initiatives. The 2021 recipient was Moffitt Cancer 
Center’s Enterprise Project Management Team. Located 
in Tampa, Florida, the Moffitt Cancer Center is one of only 
52 National Cancer Institutes designated comprehensive 
cancer centers. With more than 7,500 members, Moffitt 
has an economic impact in the state of $2.4 Billion.
Moffitt’s Enterprise Project Management Team 
was instrumental in the First Connect initiative. This 
approach ensures patients can speak directly to a can￾cer expert from their care team within one business day 
of contacting Moffitt for an appointment. Furthermore, 
the team introduced standardized project manage￾ment methodologies to serve the strategic initiatives 
across the organization and has served as coach and 
mentor on projects.
“Congratulations to the Moffitt Enterprise Proj￾ect Management Team,” said Yvette Tremonti, Moffitt 
executive. “This team was formed in early 2019 as part 
of Moffitt’s new Process & Project Management Office 
to ensure we deliver on our strategic plan and equip 
others along the way. I am impressed by how this team 
has matured itself and helped the organization do the 
same. The team’s collaborative approach with other 
shared services colleagues and operational areas is 
exemplary. I am proud of this team for achieving this 
prestigious award and the service to our patients it 
represents.”

3.3 What Is the Right Project Management Structure?
There is empirical evidence that project success is directly linked to the amount 
of autonomy and authority project managers have over their projects (Gray et al., 
1990; Larson & Gobeli, 1987, 1988; Lechler & Dvir, 2010). However, most of this 
research is based on what is best for managing specific projects. It is important to 
remember what was stated in the beginning of the chapter—the best system bal￾ances the needs of the project with those of the parent organization. So what project 
structure should an organization use? This is a complicated question with no pre￾cise answers. A number of issues need to be considered at both the organization and 
project levels.
Organization Considerations
At the organization level, the first question that needs to be asked is, how impor￾tant is project management to the success of the firm? That is, what percentage of 
core work involves projects? If over 75 percent of work involves projects, then an 
organization should consider a fully projectized organization. If an organization has 
both standard products and projects, then a matrix arrangement would appear to be 
appropriate. If an organization has very few projects, then a less formal arrange￾ment is probably all that is required. Dedicated teams could be created on an as￾needed basis and the organization could outsource project work.

A second key question involves resource availability. Remember, matrix evolved 
out of the necessity to share resources across multiple projects and functional domains 
while creating legitimate project leadership. For organizations that cannot afford to tie 
up critical personnel on individual projects, a matrix system would appear to be appro￾priate. An alternative would be to create a dedicated team but outsource project work 
when resources are not available internally.
Within the context of the first two questions, an organization needs to assess current 
practices and what changes are needed to more effectively manage projects. A strong 
project matrix is not installed overnight. The shift toward a greater emphasis on proj￾ects has a host of political implications that need to be worked through, requiring time 
and strong leadership. For example, we have observed many companies that make 
the transition from a functional organization to a matrix organization begin with a 
weak functional matrix. This is due in part to resistance by functional and department 
managers toward transferring authority to project managers. With time, these matrix 
structures eventually evolve into a project matrix.
Project Considerations
At the project level, the question is how much autonomy the project needs in order 
to be successfully completed. Hobbs and Ménard (1993) identify seven factors that 
should influence the choice of project management structure:
∙ Size of project.
∙ Strategic importance.
∙ Novelty and need for innovation.
∙ Need for integration (number of departments involved).
∙ Environmental complexity (number of external interfaces).
∙ Budget and time constraints.
∙ Stability of resource requirements.
The higher the levels of these seven factors, the more autonomy and authority the proj￾ect manager and project team need to be successful.3
 This translates into using either a 
dedicated project team or a project matrix structure. For example, these structures 
should be used for large projects that are strategically critical and are new to the com￾pany, thus requiring much innovation. These structures are also appropriate for com￾plex, multidisciplinary projects that require input from many departments, as well as 
for projects that require constant contact with customers to assess their expectations. 
Dedicated project teams should also be used for urgent projects in which the nature of 
the work requires people working steadily from beginning to end.
Many firms that are heavily involved in project management have created a flex￾ible management system that organizes projects according to project requirements. For 
example, Chaparral Steel, a mini-mill that produces steel bars and beams from scrap 
metal, classifies projects into three categories: advanced development, platform, and 
incremental. Advanced development projects are high-risk endeavors involving the 
creation of a breakthrough product or process. Platform projects are medium-risk proj￾ects involving system upgrades that yield new products and processes. Incremental

projects are low-risk, short-term projects that involve minor adjustments in existing 
products and processes. At any point in time, Chaparral might have 40–50 projects 
under way, of which only 1 or 2 are advanced, 3–5 are platform projects, and the 
remainder are small, incremental projects. The incremental projects are almost all 
done within a weak matrix with the project manager coordinating the work of func￾tional subgroups. A strong matrix is used to complete the platform projects, while 
dedicated project teams are typically created to complete the advanced development 
projects. More and more companies are using this “mix and match” approach to man￾aging projects.
3.4 Organizational Culture
The decision for combining a discussion of project management structures and 
organizational cultures in this chapter can be traced to a conversation we, the 
authors, had with two project managers who worked for a medium-sized informa￾tion technology firm.
The managers were developing a new operating platform that would be critical to 
the future success of their company. When they tried to describe how this project 
was organized, one manager began to sketch out on a napkin a complicated structure 
involving 52 different teams, each with a project leader and a technical leader! In 
response to our further probing to understand how this system worked, the manager 
stopped short and proclaimed, “The key to making this structure work is the culture in 
our company. This approach would never work at Company Y, where I worked before. 
But because of our culture here we are able to pull it off.”
This comment, our observations of other firms, and research suggest there is a 
strong connection among project management structure, organizational culture, and 
project success.4
 We have observed organizations successfully manage projects within 
the traditional functional organization because the culture encouraged cross-functional 
integration. Conversely, we have seen matrix structures break down because the cul￾ture of the organization did not support the division of authority between project man￾agers and functional managers. We have also observed companies relying on 
independent project teams because the dominant culture would not support the inno￾vation and speed necessary for success.
What Is Organizational Culture?
Organizational culture refers to a system of shared norms, beliefs, values, and 
assumptions that binds people together, thereby creating shared meanings (Deal & 
Kennedy, 1982). This system is manifested by customs and habits that exemplify the 
values and beliefs of the organization. For example, egalitarianism may be expressed 
in the informal dress worn at a high-tech firm. Conversely, mandated uniforms at a 
department store reinforce respect for the hierarchy.
Culture reflects the personality of the organization and, like an individual’s per￾sonality, can enable us to predict attitudes and behaviors of organizational members.

Culture is also one of the defining aspects of an organization that sets it apart from 
other organizations, even in the same industry.
Research suggests that there are 10 primary characteristics that, in aggregate, cap￾ture the essence of an organization’s culture:5
1. Member identity—the degree to which employees identify with the organization 
as a whole rather than with their type of job or field of professional expertise.
2. Team emphasis—the degree to which work activities are organized around groups 
rather than individuals.
3. Management focus—the degree to which management decisions take into 
account the effect of outcomes on people within the organization.
4. Unit integration—the degree to which units within the organization are encour￾aged to operate in a coordinated or interdependent manner.
5. Control—the degree to which rules, policies, and direct supervision are used to 
oversee and control employee behavior.
6. Risk tolerance—the degree to which employees are encouraged to be aggressive, 
innovative, and risk seeking.
7. Reward criteria—the degree to which rewards such as promotion and salary 
increases are allocated according to employee performance rather than seniority, 
favoritism, or other nonperformance factors.
8. Conflict tolerance—the degree to which employees are encouraged to air con￾flicts and criticisms openly.
9. Means versus ends orientation—the degree to which management focuses on 
outcomes rather than on techniques and processes used to achieve those results.
10. Open-system focus—the degree to which the organization monitors and responds 
to changes in the external environment.
As shown in Figure 3.5, each of these dimensions exists on a continuum. Assessing 
an organization according to these 10 dimensions provides a composite picture of the 
organization’s culture. This picture becomes the basis for feelings of shared under￾standing that the members have about the organization, how things are done, and the 
way members are supposed to behave. 
Culture performs several important functions in organizations. An organization’s 
culture provides a sense of identity for its members. The more clearly an organi￾zation’s shared perceptions and values are stated, the more strongly people can 
identify with their organization and feel a vital part of it. Identity generates com￾mitment to the organization and reasons for members to devote energy and loyalty 
to the organization.
A second important function is that culture helps legitimize the management system
of the organization. Culture helps clarify authority relationships. It provides reasons 
why people are in a position of authority and why their authority should be respected.
Most importantly, organizational culture clarifies and reinforces standards of 
behavior. Culture helps define what is permissible and inappropriate behavior. 
These standards span a wide range of behavior from dress code and working hours 
to challenging the judgment of superiors and collaborating with other departments.

Ultimately culture helps create social order within an organization. Imagine what it 
would be like if members didn’t share similar beliefs, values, and assumptions—chaos! 
The customs, norms, and ideals conveyed by the culture of an organization provide the 
stability and predictability in behavior that are essential for an effective organization. 
See Snapshot from Practice 3.4: Google-y for an example of this.
Although our discussion of organizational culture may appear to suggest one cul￾ture dominates the entire organization, in reality, this is rarely the case. Strong and 
thick are adjectives used to denote a culture in which the organization’s core values 
and customs are widely shared within the entire organization. Conversely, a thin or 
weak culture is one that is not widely shared or practiced within a firm.
Even within a strong organizational culture, there are likely to be subcultures, often 
aligned within specific departments or specialty areas. As noted earlier in our discus￾sion of project management structures, it is not uncommon for norms, values, and 
customs to develop within a specific field or profession such as marketing, finance, or 
operations. People working in the Marketing Department may have a different set of 
norms and values than those working in Finance.
Countercultures sometimes emerge within organizations that embody a different 
set of values, beliefs, and customs—often in direct contradiction with the culture 
espoused by top management. How pervasive these subcultures and countercultures 
are affects the strength of the culture of the organization and the extent to which cul￾ture influences members’ actions and responses.
Identifying Cultural Characteristics
Deciphering an organization’s culture is a highly interpretative, subjective process that 
requires assessment of both current and past history. The student of culture cannot 
simply rely on what people report about their culture. The physical environment in 
which people work, as well as how people act and respond to different events that 
occur, must be examined. Figure 3.6 contains a worksheet for diagnosing the culture 
of an organization. Although by no means exhaustive, the checklist often yields clues 
about the norms, customs, and values of an organization.

lar60886_ch03_072-108.indd 92 08/23/23 12:17 pm
On entering the 24-hour Googleplex 
located in Mountain View, California, 
you feel that you are walking through 
a new-age college campus rather 
than the corporate office of a  billion￾dollar business. The interconnected low-rise buildings 
with colorful, glass-encased offices feature upscale 
trappings—free gourmet meals three times a day, free 
use of an outdoor wave pool, indoor gym and large 
child care facility and private shuttle bus service to and 
from San Francisco and other residential areas—that 
are the envy of workers across the Bay Area. These 
perks and others reflect Google’s culture of keeping 
people happy and thinking in unconventional ways.
The importance of corporate culture is no more evi￾dent than in the fact that the head of Human Resources, 
Stacy Savides Sullivan, also has the title of chief culture 
officer. Her task is to try to preserve the innovative cul￾ture of a start-up as Google quickly evolves into a mam￾moth international corporation. Sullivan characterizes 
Google culture as “team-oriented, very collaborative 
and encouraging people to think nontraditionally, dif￾ferent from where they ever worked before—work with 
integrity and for the good of the company and for the 
good of the world, which is tied to our overall mission 
of making information accessible to the world.” Google 
goes to great lengths to screen new employees to make 
sure not only that they have outstanding technical capa￾bilities but also that they are going to fit Google’s cul￾ture. Sullivan goes on to define a Google-y employee as 
somebody who is “flexible, adaptable, and not focusing 
on titles and hierarchy, and just gets stuff done.”
Google’s culture is rich with customs and traditions 
not found in most corporations. For example, project 
teams typically have daily “stand-up” meetings seven 
minutes after the hour. Why seven minutes after the hour? 
Because Google co-founder Sergey Brin once estimated 
that it took seven minutes to walk across the Google 
campus. Everybody stands to make sure no one gets too 
comfortable and no time is wasted during the rapid-fire 
update. As one manager noted, “The whole concept of 
the stand-up is to talk through what everyone’s doing, so 
if someone is working on what you’re working on, you 
can discover and collaborate not duplicate.”
Another custom is “dogfooding.” This is when  a 
project team releases the functional prototype of 
a future product to Google employees for them to test 
drive. There is a strong norm within Google to test new 
products and provide feedback to the developers. 
The project team receives feedback from thousands 
of Google-ys. The internal focus group can log bugs 
or simply comment on design or functionality. Fellow 
Google-ys do not hold back on their feedback and 
are quick to point out things they don’t like. This often 
leads to significant product improvements.

1. Study the physical characteristics of an organization. What does the external archi￾tecture look like? What image does it convey? Is it unique? Are the buildings and 
offices the same quality for all employees? Or are modern buildings and fancier offices 
reserved for senior executives or managers from a specific department? What are the 
customs concerning dress? What symbols does the organization use to signal author￾ity and status within the organization? These physical characteristics can shed light 
on who has real power within the organization, the extent to which the organization is 
internally differentiated, and how formal the organization is in its business dealings.
2. Read about the organization. Examine annual reports, mission statements, press 
releases, and internal newsletters. What do they describe? What principles are espoused

in these documents? Do the reports emphasize the people who work for the organiza￾tion and what they do or the financial performance of the firm? Each emphasis reflects 
a different culture. The first demonstrates concern for the people who make up the 
company. The second may suggest a concern for results and the bottom line.
3. Observe how people interact within the organization. What is their pace—is 
it slow and methodical or urgent and spontaneous? What rituals exist within the 
organization? What values do they express? Meetings can often yield insightful 
information. Who are the people at the meetings? Who does the talking? To whom 
do they talk? How candid is the conversation? Do people speak for the organization 
or for the individual department? What is the focus of the meetings? How much 
time is spent on various issues? Issues that are discussed repeatedly and at length 
are clues about the values of the organization’s culture.
4. Interpret stories and folklore surrounding the organization. Look for similari￾ties among stories told by different people. The subjects highlighted in recurring 
stories often reflect what is important to an organization’s culture. For example, 
many of the stories that are repeated at Versatec, a Xerox subsidiary that makes 
graphic plotters for computers, involve their flamboyant co-founder, Renn Zaphi￾ropoulos. According to company folklore, one of the very first things Renn did 
when the company was formed was to assemble the top management team at his 
home. They then devoted the weekend to handmaking a beautiful teak conference 
table, around which all future decisions would be made. This table came to symbol￾ize the importance of teamwork and maintaining high standards of performance, 
two essential qualities of the culture at Versatec.

 One should also try to identify who the heroes and villains are in company folk￾lore. What do they suggest about the culture’s ideals? Returning to the Versatec story, 
when the company was eventually purchased by Xerox, many employees expressed 
concern that Versatec’s informal, play hard/work hard culture would be overwhelmed 
by the bureaucracy at Xerox. Renn rallied the employees to superior levels of perfor￾mance by arguing that if they exceeded Xerox’s expectations they would be left alone. 
Autonomy has remained a fixture of Versatec’s culture long after Renn’s retirement.
 It is also important to pay close attention to the basis for promotions and rewards. 
What do people see as the keys to getting ahead within the organization? What con￾tributes to downfalls? These last two questions can yield important insights into the 
qualities and behaviors the organization honors as well as the cultural taboos and 
behavioral land mines that can derail a career. For example, one project manager 
confided that a former colleague was sent to project management purgatory soon 
after publicly questioning the validity of a marketing report. From that point on, the 
project manager was extra careful to privately consult the Marketing Department 
whenever she had questions about their data.
With practice, an observer can assess how strong the dominant culture of an organiza￾tion is and the significance of subcultures and countercultures. Furthermore, learners 
can discern and identify where the culture of an organization stands on the 10 cul￾tural dimensions presented earlier and, in essence, begin to build a cultural profile for 
a firm. Based on this profile, conclusions can be drawn about specific customs and 
norms that need to be adhered to, as well as those behaviors and actions that violate 
the norms of a firm.
3.5 Implications of Organizational Culture for Organizing Projects
Project managers have to be able to operate in several, potentially diverse, organiza￾tional cultures. First, on internal projects, they have to interact with the culture of their 
parent organization as well as the subcultures of various departments (e.g., Marketing, 
Accounting). On external projects, they also have to interact with the project’s client or 
customer organizations. Finally, they often have to interact in varying degrees with a 
host of other organizations connected to the project. These organizations include sup￾pliers and vendors, subcontractors, consulting firms, government and regulatory agen￾cies, and in many cases community groups. Many of these organizations are likely to 
have very different cultures. Project managers have to be able to read and speak the 
culture they are working in to develop strategies, plans, and responses that are likely 
to be understood and accepted. Still, the emphasis of this chapter is on the relationship 
between organizational culture and project management structure, and it is necessary 
to defer further discussion of these implications until Chapters 10–12, which focus on 
leadership, team building, and outsourcing.
Earlier we stated that we believe there are strong relationships among project man￾agement structure, organizational culture, and successful project management. To 
explore these relationships further, let us return to the dimensions that can be used 
to characterize the culture of an organization. When examining these dimensions we 
could hypothesize that certain aspects of the culture of an organization would sup￾port successful project management, while other aspects would deter or interfere with 
effective management. Figure 3.7 attempts to identify which cultural characteristics 
create an environment conducive to completing most complex projects involving peo￾ple from different disciplines.

Note that in many cases the ideal culture is not at either extreme. For example, a 
fertile project culture would likely be one in which management balances its focus on 
the needs of both the task and the people. An optimal culture would balance concern 
with output (ends) and processes to achieve those outcomes (means). In other cases, 
the ideal culture would be on one end of a dimension. For example, because most 
projects require collaboration across disciplines, it would be desirable that the culture 
of the organization emphasize working in teams and identifying with the organization, 
not just the professional domain. Likewise, it is important that the culture support a 
certain degree of risk taking and a tolerance for constructive conflict.
One organization that appears to fit this ideal profile is 3M. 3M has received acclaim 
for creating an entrepreneurial culture within a large corporate framework. The essence 
of its culture is captured in phrases that have been chanted often by 3Mers through￾out its history: “Encourage experimental doodling.” “Hire good people and leave them 
alone.” “If you put fences around people, you get sheep. Give people the room they 
need.” Freedom and autonomy to experiment are reflected in the “15 percent rule,” which 
encourages technical people to spend up to 15 percent of their time on projects of their 
own choosing and initiative. This fertile culture has contributed to 3M’s branching out 
into more than 60,000 products and 35 separate business units (Collins & Porras, 1994).
The metaphor we choose to describe the relationship between organizational culture 
and project management is that of a riverboat trip. Culture is the river and the project is 
the boat. Organizing and completing projects within an organization in which the culture 
is conducive to project management is like paddling downstream: much less effort is 
required. In many cases, the current can be so strong that steering is all that is required. 
Such is the case for projects that operate in a project-friendly environment where team￾work and cross-functional cooperation are the norms, where there is a deep commitment 
to excellence, and where healthy conflict is voiced and dealt with quickly and effectively.
Conversely, trying to complete a project in a toxic culture is like paddling upstream: 
much more time, effort, and attention are needed to reach the destination. This would 
be the situation in cultures that discourage teamwork and cooperation, that have a low 
tolerance for conflict, and where getting ahead is based less on performance and more 
on cultivating favorable relationships with superiors. In such cases, the project manager

96
and his or her people have to overcome not only the natural obstacles of the project but 
also the prevailing negative forces inherent in the culture of the organization.
The implications of this metaphor are important. Greater project authority and time 
are necessary to complete projects that encounter a strong, negative cultural current. 
Conversely, less formal authority and fewer dedicated resources are needed to com￾plete projects in which the cultural currents generate behavior and cooperation essen￾tial to project success.
The key issue is the degree of interdependency between the parent organization 
and the project team. In cases where the prevalent organizational culture supports the 
behaviors essential to project completion, a weaker, more flexible project management 
structure can be effective. For example, one of the major reasons Chaparral Steel is 
able to use a functional matrix to successfully complete incremental projects is that 
its culture contains strong norms for cooperation (Bowen et al., 1994). See Research 
Highlight 3.1: The Secret of Success for another example of how culture supports suc￾cessful project management.
In The Secret of Success: The Double 
Helix of Formal and Informal Struc￾tures in an R&D Laboratory, Polly 
Rizova revealed the results of a 
year-long investigation into the inner 
workings of a Fortune 500 R&D labora￾tory. Through interviews with key participants and 
analysis of social networking data, Rizova assessed 
the efficacy of six high-tech development projects.
Four critical success factors emerged from her 
research. One element that is crucial to success is 
a heavy reliance on open and unrestricted patterns 
of communication, coupled with a low degree of 
formal reporting. In other words, team members 
freely interacted with each other regardless of title, 
experience, or discipline.
A second key is having individuals on the proj￾ect who are highly respected across the laboratory 
for their exceptional technical skills and experi￾ence. Similarly, it is also vital to have individuals 
involved in the project who are highly respected 
for their organizational expertise and experience. 
Having both “technical stars” and “organizational 
stars” on the project team is essential to success.
The final factor is a strong and sustained support 
for the project from the company’s corporate man￾agement. What’s more, her analysis revealed the 
interactive nature of the four conditions, namely, that 
no one condition was likely to produce successful 
outcomes on its own, but only when put together in a 
way in which they reinforce each other. Here the cul￾ture of the laboratory was seen as the key catalyst.
Rizova describes a matrix system in which 
people work on multiple projects simultaneously 
but with a different wrinkle. Individuals occupy dif￾ferent positions and play different roles depending 
upon the project. For example, it is common for a 
senior engineer to be the manager of one project 
and a researcher on another that is led by his or 
her subordinate. In essence, one must “boss” his 
or her own boss. At first glance, this formal struc￾ture should create destructive tensions. However, 
Rizova argues that the organizational culture of the 
lab is the glue that keeps things running smoothly.
She describes a culture in which the social norms 
of cooperation, respect, and civility are upheld and 
reproduced. It is a culture characterized by trust 
and  a strong drive toward superior individual and 
organizational learning and achievement. The cul￾ture is captured in the comments of researchers:
That is one of the nicest things around
here. Your opinions are listened to.
Superiors consider our advice. You will
find that most of the projects here are a
team effort.
What I like most is the positive thinking
and the “whatever it takes” attitude.
Personality conflicts can be devastating.
Here everyone helps you and supports you.
There is no “I” in the word team.
Very friendly environment. . . . I met
new people and learned a lot from them.
They do not mind sharing their expertise.

When the dominant organizational culture inhibits collaboration and innovation, it 
is advisable to insulate the project team from the dominant culture. Here it becomes 
necessary to create a self-sufficient project team. If a dedicated project team is impos￾sible because of resource constraints, then at least a project matrix should be used 
where the project manager has dominant control over the project. In both cases, the 
managerial strategy is to create a distinct team subculture in which a new set of norms, 
customs, and values evolves that will be conducive to project completion.
Under extreme circumstances, this project culture could even represent a counter￾culture in that many of the norms and values are the antithesis of the dominant, parent 
culture. Such was the case when IBM decided to develop their personal computer 
quickly in 1980 (Smith & Reinertsen, 1995). They knew that the project could get 
bogged down by the overabundance of computer knowledge and bureaucracy in the 
company. IBM also realized that they would have to work closely with suppliers and 
make use of many non-IBM parts if they were to get to the market quickly. This was 
not the IBM way at the time, so IBM established the Personal Computer (PC) project 
team in a warehouse in Boca Raton, Florida, far from corporate headquarters and other 
corporate development facilities that existed within the organization.
Summary This chapter examined two major characteristics of the parent organization that affect 
the implementation and completion of projects. The first is the formal structure of the 
organization and how it chooses to organize and manage projects. Although the indi￾vidual project manager may have very little say as to how the firm chooses to manage 
projects, s/he must be able to recognize the options available as well as the inherent 
strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.
Three basic project management structures were described and assessed as to 
their weaknesses and strengths. Only under unique circumstances can a case be 
made for managing a project within the normal functional hierarchy. When thinking 
only in terms of what is best for the project, the creation of an independent project 
team is clearly favored. However, the most effective project management system 
appropriately balances the needs of the project with those of the parent organization. 
Matrix structures emerged out of the parent organization’s need to share person￾nel and resources across multiple projects and operations while creating legitimate 
project focus. The matrix approach is a hybrid organizational form that combines 
elements of both the functional and the project team forms in an attempt to realize 
the advantages of both.
The second major characteristic of the parent organization that was discussed in this 
chapter is the concept of organizational culture. Organizational culture is the pattern 
of beliefs and expectations shared by an organization’s members. Culture includes the 
behavioral norms, customs, shared values, and “rules of the game” for getting along 
and getting ahead within the organization. It is important for project managers to be 
“culture sensitive” so that they can develop appropriate strategies and responses and 
avoid violating key norms that would jeopardize their effectiveness within the orga￾nization. We opened this chapter with a quote from renowned management thinker, 
Peter Drucker: “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” One might say that the theme of 
this chapter is “Culture eats project structures for lunch.” In both cases, we are allud￾ing to the dominant role that the culture of an organization plays in pursuing objectives 
and managing projects. Regardless of how effective your strategy or project structure 
is supposed to be, the culture of your company ultimately determines success.

The interaction between project management structure and organizational culture 
is a complicated one. We have suggested that in certain organizations, culture encour￾ages the implementation of projects. In this environment, the project management 
structure used plays a less decisive role in the success of the project. Conversely, for 
other organizations in which the culture stresses internal competition and differen￾tiation, just the opposite may be true. The prevailing norms, customs, and attitudes 
inhibit effective project management, and the project management structure plays a 
more decisive role in the successful implementation of projects. At a minimum, under 
adverse cultural conditions, the project manager needs to have significant authority 
over the project team; under more extreme conditions, firms should physically relocate 
dedicated project teams to complete critical projects. In both cases, the managerial 
strategy should be to insulate project work from the dominant culture so that a more 
positive subculture can emerge among project participants.
The project management structure of the organization and the culture of the orga￾nization are major elements of the environment in which a project is initiated. Subse￾quent chapters will examine how project managers and professionals work within this 
environment to successfully complete projects.

1. Going to college is analogous to working in a matrix environment in that most 
students take more than one class and must distribute their time across multiple 
classes. What problems does this situation create for you? How does it affect your 
performance? How could the system be better managed to make your life less dif￾ficult and more productive?
2. You work for LL Company, which manufactures high-end optical scopes for hunt￾ing rifles. LL Company has been the market leader for the past 20 years and has 
decided to diversify by applying its technology to develop a top-quality binocular. 
What kind of project management structure would you recommend they use for 
this project? What information would you like to have to make this recommenda￾tion and why?
3. You work for Barbata Electronics. Your R&D people believe they have come up 
with an affordable technology that will double the capacity of existing MP3 play￾ers and use an audio format that is superior to MP3. The project is code named 
KYSO (Knock Your Socks Off). What kind of project management structure 
would you recommend they use for the KYSO project? What information would 
you like to have to make this recommendation and why?
4. This chapter discussed the role of values and beliefs in forming an organiza￾tion’s culture. The topic of organizational culture is big business on the Internet. 
Many companies use their Web pages to describe their mission, vision, and 
corporate values and beliefs. There also are many consulting firms that advertise 
how they help organizations change their culture. The purpose of this exercise is 
for you to obtain information pertaining to the organizational culture for 
two different companies. You can go about this task by very simply searching 
the key words organizational culture or corporate vision and values. This search 
will identify numerous companies for you to use to answer the following ques￾tions. You may want to select companies that you would like to work for in 
the future.
a. What are the espoused values and beliefs of the companies?
b. Use the worksheet in Figure 3.6 to assess the Web page. What does the Web 
page reveal about the culture of this organization? Would this culture be condu￾cive to effective project management?
5. Use the cultural dimensions listed in Figure 3.5 to assess the culture of your 
school. Instead of employees, consider students, and instead of management, 
use faculty. For example, member identity refers to the degree to which

6. You work as an analyst in the Marketing Department of Springfield International 
(SI). SI uses a weak matrix to develop new services. Management has created an 
extremely competitive organizational culture that places an emphasis upon achiev￾ing results above everything else. One of the project managers you have been 
assigned to help has been pressuring you to make his project your number one 
priority. He also wants you to expand the scope of your work on his project beyond 
what your marketing manager believes is necessary or appropriate. The project 
manager is widely perceived as a rising star within SI. Up to now you have been 
resisting the project manager’s pressure and complying with your marketing man￾ager’s directives. However, your most recent interchange with the project manager 
ended by his saying, “I’m not happy with the level of help I am getting from 
you and I will remember this when I become VP of Marketing.” How would you 
respond and why?

Case 3.1
Moss and McAdams Accounting Firm
Bruce Palmer had worked for Moss and McAdams (M&M) for six years and was just 
promoted to account manager. His first assignment was to lead an audit of Johnson￾ville Trucks. He was quite pleased with the five accountants who had been assigned 
to his team, especially Zeke Olds. Olds was an army vet who had returned to school 
to get a double major in accounting and computer sciences. He was on top of the lat￾est developments in financial information systems and had a reputation for coming up 
with innovative solutions to problems.
M&M was a well-established regional accounting firm with 160 employees located 
across six offices in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The main office, where Palmer worked, 
was in Green Bay, Wisconsin. In fact, one of the founding members, Seth Moss, played

lar60886_ch03_072-108.indd 103 08/23/23 12:17 pm
briefly for the hometown NFL Packers during the late 1950s. M&M’s primary services 
were corporate audits and tax preparation. Over the last two years, the partners decided 
to move more aggressively into the consulting business. M&M projected that consult￾ing would represent 40 percent of their growth over the next five years.
M&M operated within a matrix structure. As new clients were recruited, a man￾ager was assigned to the account. A manager could be assigned to several accounts, 
depending on the size and scope of the work. This was especially true in the case of 
tax preparation projects, where it was not uncommon for a manager to be assigned to 
8–12 clients. Likewise, senior and staff accountants were assigned to multiple account 
teams. Ruby Sands was the office manager responsible for assigning personnel to dif￾ferent accounts at the Green Bay office. She did her best to assign staff to multiple 
projects under the same manager. This wasn’t always possible, and sometimes accoun￾tants had to work on projects led by different managers.
M&M, like most accounting firms, had a tiered promotion system. New CPAs 
entered as junior or staff accountants. Within two years, their performance was 
reviewed and they were either asked to leave or promoted to senior accountant. 
Sometime during their fifth or sixth year, a decision was made to promote them to 
account manager. Finally, after 10–12 years with the firm, the manager was consid￾ered for promotion to partner. This was a very competitive position. During the last 
five years, only 20 percent of account managers at M&M had been promoted to part￾ner. However, once a partner, they were virtually guaranteed the position for life and 
enjoyed significant increases in salary, benefits, and prestige. M&M had a reputation 
for being a results-driven organization; partner promotions were based on meeting 
deadlines, retaining clients, and generating revenue. The promotion team based its 
decision on the relative performance of the account manager in comparison to his or 
her cohorts.
One week into the Johnsonville audit, Palmer received a call from Sands to visit 
her office. There he was introduced to Ken Crosby, who had recently joined M&M 
after working nine years for a Big 5 accounting firm. Crosby was recruited to man￾age special consulting projects. Sands reported that Crosby had just secured a major 
consulting project with Springfield Metals. This was a major coup for the firm: 
M&M had competed against two Big 5 accounting firms for the project. Sands went 
on to explain that she was working with Crosby to put together his team. Crosby 
insisted that Zeke Olds be assigned to his team. Sands told him that this would be 
impossible because Olds was already assigned to work on the Johnsonville audit. 
Crosby persisted, arguing that Olds’s expertise was essential to the Springfield 
project. Sands decided to work out a compromise and have Olds split time across 
both projects.
At this time Crosby turned to Palmer and said, “I believe in keeping things simple. 
Why don’t we agree that Olds works for me in the mornings and you in the afternoons? 
I’m sure we can work out any problems that come up. After all, we both work for the 
same firm.”
SIX WEEKS LATER
Palmer could scream whenever he remembered Crosby’s words “After all, we both 
work for the same firm.” The first sign of trouble came during the first week of the 
new arrangement when Crosby called, begging to have Olds work all of Thursday on 
his project. They were conducting an extensive client visit, and Olds was critical to 
the assessment. After Palmer reluctantly agreed, Crosby said he owed him one. The 
next week, when Palmer called Crosby to request that he return the favor, Crosby flatly 
Final PDF to printer104 Chapter 3 Organization: Structure and Culture
lar60886_ch03_072-108.indd 104 08/23/23 12:17 pm
refused and said any other time but not this week. Palmer tried again a week later and 
got the same response.
At first, Olds showed up promptly at 1:00 p.m. at Palmer’s office to work on the 
audit. Soon it became a habit to show up 30–60 minutes late. There was always 
a good reason. He was in a meeting in Springfield and couldn’t just leave, or an 
urgent task took longer than planned. One time it was because Crosby took his 
entire team out to lunch at the new Thai restaurant—Olds was over an hour late 
because of slow service. In the beginning Olds usually made up the time by work￾ing after hours, but Palmer could tell from conversations he overheard that this was 
creating tension at home.
What probably bothered Palmer the most were the e-mails and telephone calls Olds 
received from Crosby and his team members during the afternoons when he was sup￾posed to be working for Palmer. A couple of times Palmer could have sworn that Olds 
was working on Crosby’s project in his (Palmer’s) office.
Palmer met with Crosby to talk about the problem and voice his complaints. Crosby 
acted surprised and even a little hurt. He promised things would change, but the pat￾tern continued.
Palmer was becoming paranoid about Crosby. He knew that Crosby played golf 
with Olds on the weekends and could just imagine him badmouthing the Johnson￾ville project and pointing out how boring auditing work was. The sad fact was that 
there probably was some truth to what he was saying. The Johnsonville project was 
getting bogged down, and the team was slipping behind schedule. One of the con￾tributing factors was Olds’s performance. His work was not up to its usual standards. 
Palmer approached Olds about this, and Olds became defensive. Olds later apolo￾gized and confided that he found it difficult switching his thinking from consulting 
to auditing and then back to consulting. He promised to do better, and there was a 
slight improvement in his performance.
The last straw came when Olds asked to leave work early on Friday so that he could 
take his wife and kids to a Milwaukee Brewers baseball game. It turned out Spring￾field Metals had given Crosby their corporate tickets, and he decided to treat his team 
with box seats right behind the Brewers dugout. Palmer hated to do it, but he had to 
refuse the request. He felt guilty when he overheard Olds explaining to his son on the 
telephone why they couldn’t go to the game.
Palmer finally decided to request an urgent meeting with Sands to resolve the prob￾lem. He got up enough nerve and put in the call only to be told that Sands wouldn’t 
be back in the office until next week. As he put the receiver down, he thought maybe 
things would get better.
TWO WEEKS LATER
Sands showed up unexpectedly at Palmer’s office and said they needed to talk about 
Olds. Palmer was delighted, thinking that now he could tell her what had been going 
on. But before he had a chance to speak, Sands told him that Olds had come to see 
her yesterday. She told him that Olds confessed he was having a hard time working 
on both Crosby’s and Palmer’s projects. He was having difficulty concentrating 
on the auditing work in the afternoon because he was thinking about some of the 
consulting issues that had emerged during the morning. He was putting in extra 
hours to try to meet both of the projects’ deadlines, and this was creating problems 
at home. The bottom line was that he was stressed out and couldn’t deal with the 
situation. He asked that he be assigned full time to Crosby’s project. Sands went on 
Final PDF to printerChapter 3 Organization: Structure and Culture 105
lar60886_ch03_072-108.indd 105 08/23/23 12:17 pm
to say that Olds didn’t blame Palmer; in fact, he had a lot of nice things to say about 
him. He just enjoyed the consulting work more and found it more challenging. 
Sands concluded by saying, “I told him I understood, and I would talk to you about 
the situation and see what could be done. Frankly, I think we should pull him from 
your project and have him work full time on Crosby’s project. What do you think?”

2. What, if anything, could Palmer have done to avoid losing Olds?

from this case?

Case 3.2
Horizon Consulting
Patti Smith looked up at the bright blue Carolina sky before she entered the offices of 
Horizon Consulting. It was Friday, which meant she needed to prepare for the weekly 
status report meeting. Horizon Consulting is a custom software development company 
that offers fully integrated mobile application services for iPhone™, Android™, Win￾dows Mobile®, and BlackBerry® platforms. Horizon was founded by Lola Thrasher, 
a former marketing executive, who quickly saw the potential for digital marketing 
via smartphones. Horizon enjoyed initial success in sports marketing but quickly 
expanded to other industries. A key to their success was the decline in cost for devel￾oping smartphone applications, which expanded the client base. The decline in cost 
was primarily due to the learning curve and ability to build customized solutions on 
established platforms.
Patti Smith was a late bloomer who went back to college after working in the res￾taurant business for nine years. She and her former husband had tried unsuccessfully 
to operate a vegetarian restaurant in Golden, Colorado. After her divorce, she returned 
to University of Colorado, where she majored in management information systems 
(MIS) with a minor in marketing. While she enjoyed her marketing classes much more 
than her MIS classes, she felt the IT know-how she acquired would give her an advan￾tage in the job market. This turned out to be true, as Horizon hired her to be an account 
manager soon after graduation.
Patti Smith was hired to replace Stephen Stills, who had started the restaurant side 
of the business at Horizon. Stephen was “let go,” according to one account manager, 
for being a prima donna and hoarding resources. Patti’s clients ranged from high-end 
restaurants to hole-in the-wall “mom and pop shops.” She helped develop smartphone 
apps that let users make reservations, browse menus, receive alerts on daily specials, 
provide customer feedback, order take-out, and in some cases order delivery. As an 
account manager, she worked with clients to assess their needs, develop a plan, and 
create customized smartphone apps.

lar60886_ch03_072-108.indd 106 08/23/23 12:17 pm
Horizon appeared to be a good fit for Patti. She had enough technical training to 
be able to work with software engineers and help guide them to produce client-ready 
products. At the same time, she could relate to the restaurateurs and enjoyed working 
with them on web design and digital marketing.
Horizon was organized into three departments: Sales, Software Development, 
and Graphics, with account managers acting as project managers. Account managers 
generally came from Sales and divided their time between projects and sales pitches 
to potential new clients. Horizon employed a core group of software engineers and 
designers, supplemented by contracted programmers when needed.
The first step in developing a smartphone application involved the account manager 
meeting with the client to define the requirements and vision for the application. The 
account manager then worked with a Graphic User Interface (GUI) designer to come 
up with a preliminary story board of how the application would function and look. 
Once the initial concept and requirements were approved, the account manager was 
assigned two pairs of software engineers. The first pair (app engineers) worked on the 
smartphone side of the application, while the second pair worked on the client side. 
Horizon preferred to have software engineers work in tandem so that they could check 
each other’s work. The two app engineers typically worked full time on the applica￾tion until it was completed, while the other engineers worked on multiple projects as 
needed. Likewise, GUI designers worked on the project at certain key stages in the 
product development cycle when their expertise was needed.
The head of Graphics managed the GUI designers’ schedule, while the head of 
Software managed the software engineer assignments. At the end of each project, 
account managers submitted performance reviews of their team. The director of sales 
was responsible for the account managers’ performance reviews based on customer 
satisfaction, generation of sales, and project performance.
Horizon believed in iterative development, and every two to three weeks account 
managers were expected to demonstrate the latest version of applications to clients. 
This led to useful feedback and in many cases redefinition of the scope of the project. 
Often clients wanted to add more functionality to their application once they realized 
what the software could do. Depending upon the complexity of the application and 
changes introduced once the project was under way, it typically took Horizon two to 
four months to deliver a finished product to a client.
Patti was currently working on three projects. One was for Shanghai Wok, a busy 
Chinese mom and pop restaurant in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina. The owners 
of Shanghai Wok wanted Horizon to create a smartphone app that would allow cus￾tomers to order and pay in advance for meals they would simply pick up at a walk-up 
window. The second project was for Taste of India, which operated in Kannapolis, 
North Carolina. They wanted Horizon to create a phone app that would allow staff at 
the nearby bio-tech firms to order food that would be delivered on-site during lunch 
and dinner hours. The last project was for Nearly Normal, a vegetarian restaurant that 
wanted to send out e-mail alerts to subscribers that would describe in detail their daily 
fresh specials.
Lola Thrasher was an admirer of Google and encouraged a playful but focused 
environment at work. Employees were allowed to decorate their work spaces, bring 
pets to work, and play Ping-Pong or pool when they needed a break. Horizon paid its 
employees well, but the big payoff was the annual Christmas bonus. This bonus was 
based on overall company profits, which were distributed proportionately based on 
pay grade and performance reviews. It was not uncommon for employees to receive a 
10–15 percent boost in pay at the end of the year.

STATUS REPORT MEETING
As was her habit, Patti entered the status report meeting room early. David Briggs was 
in the midst of describing the game-winning catch John Lorsch had made in last night’s 
softball game. Horizon sponsored a co-ed city league softball team, which most of the 
account managers played on. Patti had been coaxed to play to ensure that the requisite 
number of “females” were on the field. She balked at the idea at first; softball wasn’t 
really her sport, but she was glad she did. Not only was it fun but it gave her a chance 
to get to know the other managers.
Thrasher entered the room and everyone settled down to business. She started off 
as she always did, by asking if anybody had important news to bring to everyone’s 
attention. Jackson Browne slowly raised his hand and said, “I am afraid I do. I just 
received notification from Apple iOS that they have rejected our TAT app.” TAT 
was a phone app, which Jackson was the project lead on, that allowed subscribers to 
reserve and see in real time what swimming lanes were available at a prestigious ath￾letic club. This announcement was followed by a collective groan. Before an Apple 
app could go operational it had to be submitted to and approved by Apple. Usually, 
this was not a problem, but lately Apple had been rejecting apps for a variety of 
reasons. Jackson went on to circulate the list of changes that had to be made before 
Apple would approve the app. The group studied the list and in some cases ridiculed 
the new requirements.
Ultimately Thrasher asked Jackson how long it would take to make the necessary 
changes and resubmit the app for approval. Jackson felt it would probably take two to 
three weeks at most. Thrasher asked who the engineers working on this project were. 
Patti’s heart fell. One of the app engineers who had developed the TAT app was work￾ing on her Shanghai Wok project. She knew what was going to happen next. Thrasher 
announced, “OK, everyone, it only makes sense that these engineers are the best ones 
to finish what they had started, so they are all going to have to be reassigned back to 
the TAT project. Those affected are going to have to get together after this meeting 
and figure out how to replace them.” The meeting then proceeded as planned, with all 
the account managers reporting the status of their projects and sharing relevant issues 
with the group.
POST-MEETING
As everyone filed out, Patti looked around to see who else was in her same boat. 
There were three other account managers as well as Jackson Browne. Resource 
assignments were a recurring issue at Horizon, given the nature of their work. 
Horizon had developed a policy where decisions were made based on project pri￾ority. Each project was assigned a Green, Blue, or Orange designation based on 
the company priority. Priority status was based on the extent to which the project 
contributed to the mission of the firm. The Shanghai Wok project, given its limited 
size and scope, was an Orange project, which was the lowest ranking. The list of 
available software engineers was displayed on the big screen. Patti was familiar with 
only a few of the names.
Leigh Taylor, who had the only Green project, immediately selected Jason Wheeler 
from the list. She had used him before and was confident in his work. Tom Watson and 
Samantha Stewart both had Blue Projects and needed to replace a mobile app engineer. 
They both immediately jumped on the name of Prem Mathew, claiming he was the best 
person for their project. After some friendly jousting, Tom said, “OK, Sam, you can have

him; I remember when you helped me out on the Argos project; besides, my project is 
just beginning. I’ll take Shin Chen.” Everyone looked at Patti; she started by saying, 
“You know, I am familiar with only a few of these names; I guess I’ll go with Mike Thu.” 
Jackson interjected, “Hey, everyone, I am really sorry this happened, and I am sure Mike 
is a good programmer, but I recommend you work with Axel Gerthoff. I have used him 
before, and he is a very quick study and a joy to work with.” This was a relief to Patti 
and she quickly took his advice. They left to submit a report to Thrasher detailing the 
decisions they each had made and the impact on their projects.

Project managers in charge of a single small project can plan and schedule the proj￾ect tasks without much formal planning and information. However, when the project 
manager must manage several small projects or a large, complex project, a threshold 
is quickly reached in which the project manager can no longer cope with the detail.
This chapter describes a disciplined, structured method for selectively collecting 
information to use through all phases of the project life cycle, to meet the needs of all 
stakeholders (e.g., customer, management), and to measure performance against the 
strategic plan of the organization. The suggested method is a selective outline of 
the project called the work breakdown structure. The early stages of developing the 
outline ensure that all tasks are identified and that project participants have an under￾standing of what is to be done. Once the outline and its detail are defined, an integrated 
information system can be developed to schedule work and allocate budgets. This 
baseline information is later used for control.
In addition, the chapter presents a variant of the work breakdown structure called 
the process breakdown structure as well as responsibility matrices that are used 
for smaller, less complex projects. With the work of the project defined through the

work breakdown structure, the chapter concludes with the process of creating a com￾munication plan used to help coordinate project activities and follow progress.
The five generic steps described provide a structured approach for collecting the 
project information necessary for developing a work breakdown structure. These steps 
and the development of project networks found in the next chapters all take place 
concurrently, and several iterations are typically required to develop dates and budgets 
that can be used to manage the project. The old saying “We can control only what we 
have planned” is true; therefore, defining the project is the first step.
4.1 Step 1: Defining the Project Scope
The project charter authorizes the project manager to begin to define the scope of the 
project. Defining the project scope sets the stage for developing a detailed project plan. 
Project scope is a definition of the end result or mission of your project—a product or 
service for your client/customer. The primary purpose is to define as clearly as pos￾sible the deliverable(s) for the end user and to focus project plans.
Research clearly shows that a poorly defined scope or mission is the most frequently 
mentioned barrier to project success. In a study involving more than 1,400 project man￾agers in the United States and Canada, Gobeli and Larson (1990) found that approxi￾mately 50 percent of the planning problems relate to unclear definition of scope and 
goals. This and other studies suggest a strong correlation between project success and 
clear scope definition (Ashley et al., 1987; Pinto & Slevin, 1988; Standish Group, 
2009). The scope document directs focus on the project purpose throughout the life of 
the project for the customer and project participants.
The scope should be developed under the direction of the project manager, customer, 
and other significant stakeholders. The project manager is responsible for seeing that there 
is agreement with the owner on project objectives, deliverables at each stage of the proj￾ect, technical requirements, and so forth. For example, a deliverable in the early stage 
might be specifications; for the second stage, three prototypes for production; for the third, 
a sufficient quantity to introduce to market; and finally, marketing promotion and training.
Your project scope definition is a document that will be published and used by 
the project owner and project participants for planning and measuring project suc￾cess. Scope describes what you expect to deliver to your customer when the project 
is complete. Your project scope should define the results to be achieved in specific, 
tangible, and measurable terms.
Employing a Project Scope Checklist
Clearly project scope is the keystone interlocking all elements of a project plan. To 
ensure that scope definition is complete, you may wish to use the following checklist:
LO 4-1
Identify key elements of 
a project scope state￾ment and understand 
why a complete scope 
statement is critical to 
project success.
Project Scope Checklist
1. Project objective
2. Product scope description
3. Justification
4. Deliverables
5. Milestones
6. Technical requirements
7. Limits and exclusions
8. Acceptance criteria
Final PDF to printer112 Chapter 4 Defining the Project
lar60886_ch04_109-139.indd 112 08/23/23 12:46 pm
1. Project objective. The first step of project scope definition is to define the overall 
objective to meet your customer’s need(s). For example, as a result of extensive 
market research a computer software company decides to develop a program that 
automatically translates verbal sentences in English to Russian. The project should 
be completed within three years at a cost not to exceed $1.5 million. Another exam￾ple is to design and construct a portable hazardous-waste thermal treatment system 
in 13 months at a cost not to exceed $13 million. The project objective answers the 
questions of what, when, how much, and at times where.
2. Product scope description. This step is a detailed description of the characteristics 
of the product, service, or outcome of the project. The description is progressively 
elaborated throughout the project. The product scope answers the question “What 
end result is wanted?” For example, if the product is a cell phone, its product scope 
will be its screen size, battery, processor, camera type, memory, and so on. These 
descriptions are often based on product/end-user requirements. Requirements 
should be prioritized, for example, (1) lightweight, (2) AI (artificial intelligence) 
capability, (3) connection with other products, (4) attractive, etc. Requirements 
tend to start off general and become more detailed as more information about the 
requirements become known.
3. Justification. It is important that project team members and stakeholders know 
why management authorized the project. What is the problem or opportunity the 
project is addressing? This is sometimes referred to as the business case for 
the project, since it usually includes cost/benefit analysis and strategic significance. 
For example, on a new-release project, the justification may be an expected ROI of 
30 percent and an enhanced reputation in the marketplace.
4. Deliverables. The next step is to define major deliverables—the expected, mea￾surable outputs over the life of the project. For example, deliverables in the early 
design phase of a project might be a list of specifications. In the second phase, 
deliverables might be software coding and a technical manual. The next phase 
might be the prototype. The final phase might be final tests and approved software. 
Note: Deliverables and requirements are often used interchangeably.
5. Milestones. A milestone is a significant event in a project that occurs at a point 
in time. The milestone schedule shows only major segments of work; it repre￾sents first, rough-cut estimates of time, cost, and resources for the project. The 
milestone schedule is built using the deliverables as a platform to identify major 
segments of work and an end date—for example, testing complete and finished by 
July 1 of the same year. Milestones should be natural, important control points in 
the project. Achievement of a milestone should be easy for all project participants 
to recognize.
6. Technical requirements. More frequently than not, a product or service will have 
technical requirements to ensure proper performance. Technical requirements typi￾cally clarify the deliverables or define the performance specifications. For exam￾ple, a technical requirement for a personal computer might be the ability to accept 
120-volt alternating current or 240-volt direct current without any adapters or user 
switches. Another well-known example is the ability of 911 emergency systems to 
identify the caller’s phone number and the location of the phone. Examples from 
information systems projects include the speed and capacity of database systems 
and connectivity with alternative systems. For understanding the importance of 
key requirements, see Snapshot from Practice 4.1: Big Bertha ERC II versus the 
USGA’s COR Requirement.

In 1991 Callaway Golf Equipment 
introduced their Big Bertha driver and 
revolutionized the golf equipment 
business. Big Bertha—named after 
the World War I German long-distance 
cannon—was much larger than conventional woods 
and lacked a hosel (the socket in the head of the club 
into which the shaft is inserted) so that the weight 
could be better distributed throughout the head. This 
innovative design gave the clubhead a larger sweet 
spot, which allowed a player to strike the golf ball off￾center and not suffer much loss in distance or accuracy.
In 2000 Callaway introduced the Big Bertha ERC 
II forged titanium driver. “Designing the ERC II was a 
dream experience,” said Richard C. Helmstetter, senior 
executive vice president of research and development 
and chief of new products. “We had no restrictions, so 
we were able to think outside the box to accomplish 
our goal of making the energy transfer from club to ball 
as efficient as possible. This allows golfers to gener￾ate more ball speed without swinging harder, which 
leads to greater distance. We used a combination 
of advanced new computer design technology and 
hands-on research with golfers from around the world. 
As a result, we created some design elements that go 
beyond any previous driver designs. Feedback from 
the players who have tested this driver indicates that 
our efforts dramatically improved the performance all 
golfers can expect to get from these drivers.”*
However, there was a big problem. The new ver￾sion of Bertha did not conform to the coefficient of 
restitution (COR) requirement established by the 
United States Golf Association (USGA). As a result, it 
was barred from use by golfers in North America who 
intended to play by the USGA’s Rules of Golf.
The USGA felt that the integrity of the game was 
being threatened by technological advances. Players 
were hitting balls so much farther and straighter that 
golf courses around the world were being redesigned 
to make them longer and more difficult. This was 
expensive.
So in 1998, the USGA established performance 
thresholds for all new golf equipment. In order to pre￾vent manufacturers from developing more powerful 
clubs, the USGA limited the COR of new golf equipment 
to 0.83. The COR was calculated by firing a golf ball 
at a driver out of a cannonlike machine at 109 miles 
per hour. The speed that the ball returned to the can￾non could not exceed 83 percent of its initial speed 
(90.47 mph). The USGA called the ratio of incoming to 
outgoing velocity the coefficient of restitution (COR). 
Studies indicated that a 0.01 increase in COR resulted 
in two extra yards of carry. The Big Bertha ERC II’s COR 
was 0.86.
After numerous efforts to get USGA to change its 
technical requirements, Callaway’s engineers went back 
to the drawing board and in 2002 introduced Great Big 
Bertha II, which conformed to USGA’s 0.83 COR restric￾tion. They also continued to produce the ERC II.

7. Limits and exclusions. The limits of scope should be defined. Failure to do so can 
lead to false expectations and to expending resources and time on the wrong prob￾lem. The following are examples of limits: work on-site is allowed only between 
the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.; system maintenance and repair will be done 
only up to one month after final inspection; and the client will be billed for addi￾tional training beyond that prescribed in the contract. Exclusions further define the

boundary of the project by stating what is not included. Examples include: data will 
be collected by the client, not the contractor; a house will be built, but no landscap￾ing or security devices added; software will be installed, but no training given.
8. Acceptance criteria. Acceptance criteria are a set of conditions that must be met 
before the deliverables are accepted. The following are examples: all tasks and 
milestones are complete, new service processes begin with a less than 1 percent 
defect rate, third-party certification is required, and customer on-site inspection 
is required.
Scope statements are twofold. There is a short, one- to two-page summary of key 
elements of the scope, followed by extended documentation of each element (e.g., a 
detailed milestone schedule or risk analysis report). See Snapshot from Practice 4.2: 
Scope Statement for an example of a summary page.
The project scope checklist in Step 1 is generic. Different industries and companies 
will develop unique checklists and templates to fit their needs and specific kinds of 
projects. A few companies engaged in contracted work refer to scope statements as 
“statements of work (SOWs).” Some organizations use the term project charter. How￾ever, the term project charter in the world of project management is a document that 
authorizes the project manager to form a team and initiate the project. This document 
is issued by upper management and provides the project manager with written author￾ity to use organizational resources for project activities. Often the charter will include 
a brief scope description as well as such items as risk limits, business case, spending 
limits, and even team composition.
Many projects suffer from scope creep, which is the tendency for the project scope 
to expand over time—usually by changing requirements, specifications, and priorities. 
Scope creep can have a positive or negative effect on the project, but in most cases 
scope creep means added costs and possible project delays. Changes in requirements, 
specifications, and priorities frequently result in cost overruns and delays. Examples 
are abundant—the Denver Airport baggage handling system, Boston’s new freeway 
system (“The Big Dig”), the Sochi Winter Olympics, and the list goes on. On soft￾ware development projects, scope creep is manifested in bloated products in which 
added functionality undermines ease of use. For a classic example of scope creep, see 
Snapshot from Practice the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.
Six of the most common causes of scope creep are
∙ Poor requirement analysis. Customers often don’t really know what they want. 
“I’ll know it when I see it” syndrome contributes to wasted effort and ambiguity.
∙ Not involving users early enough. Too often project teams think they know what 
the end user needs, only to find out later they were mistaken. The consequence is 
requirements are being adding as project progresses.
∙ Underestimating project complexity. Complexity and associated uncertainty 
naturally lead to changes in scope, since there are so many unknowns yet to be 
discovered.
∙ Too many decision-makers. Often in order to reduce conflict, unnecessary com￾promises are made.
∙ Lack of change control. A robust change control process is needed to ensure that 
only appropriate changes occur in the scope of the project.
∙ Gold plating. Gold plating refers to adding extra value to the project that is beyond 
the scope of the project. This is common in software projects where developers add 
features that they like.

SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 4.2 Scope Statement

In many cases, these causes reflect a misfit—traditional project management meth￾ods being applied to high-uncertainty projects (remember Figure 1.2!). Instead of 
trying to establish plans up front, Agile project management should be applied to dis￾cover what needs to be done. On Agile projects, the scope is assumed to evolve rather 
than be prescribed. Scope creep is managed and reflects progress.
If the project scope needs to change, it is critical to have a sound change control 
process in place that records the change and keeps a log of all project changes. Change 
control is one of the topics of Chapter 7. Project managers in the field constantly sug￾gest that dealing with changing requirements is one of their most challenging problems.

In the annals of project management 
history, one of the most famous exam￾ples of scope creep is the develop￾ment of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle 
(BFV) by the U.S. Army. The Bradley 
has been described by military officers and historians, 
as a weapon that means “all things to all people” and 
“a proverbial camel. . .that does nothing well.”
In 1967, the Soviet Union introduced the BMP 
(Boyevaya Mashina Pyekhoty), an amphibious, tracked 
vehicle with tank and armored personnel carrier capa￾bilities. Despite BMP’s serious design flaw, a small hull 
size that could carry only “short” Soviet soldiers, the 
U.S. military was eager to build a vehicle that was part 
tank and part personnel carrier. The original require￾ments were for vehicle with a two-man turret, cannon, 
coaxial machine gun, and nine troop carry capacity.
The list of requirements grew as more agencies 
made recommendations and further additions to the 
design. The Office of Secretary of Defense advocated 
the inclusion of firing ports, a cannon, and antitank 
munitions, while armored officers wanted to increase 
firepower by adding long-range TOW-missiles. TOW 
stands for Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire￾guided. Although there were concerns over the vehicles 
increase weight and cost, BMP development continued 
without design or cost trade-offs.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Army was also developing an 
armored reconnaissance scout vehicle. In 1976, the BMP 
project was merged with the scout project. At this point, it 
was decided to create a completely new vehicle platform. 
The rationale was that costs savings could be achieved 
since the two vehicles had common requirements.
In 1977, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) 
of Congress investigated the fighting vehicle’s current 
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE The Bradley Fighting Vehicle*
swimming capability and reported that it was too heavy 
and that it took too long to inflate for water travel. The 
U.S. Army was still determined to push for retaining 
the amphibious requirements and including TOW mis￾siles. Over the next four years, several design itera￾tions followed before production began in 1981.
The exorbitant development cost overruns of the BFV 
caught the attention of the press and the public in 1980. 
Pentagon reformists seized on the BFV as an opportunity 
to display flaws in Department of Defense (DoD) weap￾ons acquisitions, development, and testing procedures.
DoD critics were skeptical of the U.S. Army’s fail￾ure to adequately simulate combat to test the overall 
effectiveness of the vehicle. The U.S. Army conducted 
limited field tests and liked to rely on tests of individual 
components and computer simulations to assess com￾bat worthiness. When BFV was finally tested under 
maximum fire, it proved unsafe for personnel inside. 
The vehicle had to go back to the drawing board. 
Eventually, significant improvements were made in 
suspension, armor, and munitions storage to enhance 
survivability and combat effectiveness.
In the end, the final version of the BFV was quite 
different from the originally planned armored per￾sonnel carrier. It was 13 tons heavier than originally 
specified and carried less people. Furthermore, it took 
16 years from the time the first requirements were set 
in 1964 to the time a vehicle was finally approved for 
production. Even after that more changes had to be 
made after combat simulation tests.

4.2 Step 2: Establishing Project Priorities
Quality and the ultimate success of a project are traditionally defined as meeting and/or 
exceeding the expectations of the customer and/or upper management in terms of the 
cost (budget), time (schedule), and performance (scope) of the project (see Figure 4.1). 
The interrelationship among these criteria varies. For example, sometimes it is neces￾sary to compromise the performance and scope of the project to get the project done 
quickly or less expensively. Often the longer a project takes, the more expensive it 
becomes. However, a positive correlation between cost and schedule may not always 
be true. Other times project costs can be reduced by using cheaper, less efficient labor 
or equipment that extends the duration of the project. Likewise, as will be seen in 
LO 4-3
Understand why it is 
important to establish 
project priorities in 
terms of cost, time, and 
performance.

lar60886_ch04_109-139.indd 117 08/23/23 12:46 pm
Chapter 9, project managers are often forced to expedite, or “crash,” certain key activi￾ties by adding additional labor, thereby raising the original cost of the project.
One of the primary jobs of a project manager is to manage the trade-offs among 
time, cost, and performance. To do so, project managers must define and understand 
the nature of the priorities of the project. They need to have a candid discussion 
with the project customer and upper management to establish the relative importance 
of each criterion. For example, what happens when the customer keeps adding require￾ments? Or if midway through the project a trade-off must be made between cost and 
expediting, which criterion has priority?
One technique that is useful for this purpose is completing a priority matrix for 
the project to identify which criterion is constrained, which should be enhanced, and 
which can be accepted: 
Constrain. The original parameter is fixed. The project must meet the completion 
date, specifications and scope of the project, or budget.
Enhance. Given the scope of the project, which criterion should be optimized? 
In the case of time and cost, this usually means taking advantage of opportunities 
to either reduce costs or shorten the schedule. Conversely, with regard to perfor￾mance, enhancing means adding value to the project.
Accept. For which criterion is it tolerable not to meet the original parameters? 
When trade-offs have to be made, is it permissible to allow the schedule to slip, to 
reduce the scope and performance of the project, or to go over budget?
Figure 4.2 displays the priority matrix for the development of a new wireless router. 
Because time-to-market is important to sales, the project manager is instructed to take 
advantage of every opportunity to reduce completion time. In doing so, going over 
budget is acceptable, though not desirable. At the same time, the original performance
specifications for the router as well as reliability standards cannot be compromised. 
Priorities vary from project to project. For example, for many software projects 
time-to-market is critical, and companies like Microsoft may defer original scope 
requirements to later versions in order to get to the market first. Alternatively, for 
special event projects (conferences, parades, tournaments) time is constrained once the 
date has been announced, and if the budget is tight the project manager will compro￾mise the scope of the project in order to complete the project on time.
Some would argue that all three criteria are always constrained and that good 
project managers should seek to optimize each criterion. If everything goes well on 
a project and no major problems or setbacks are encountered, their argument may 
be valid. However, this situation is rare, and project managers are often forced to 
make tough decisions that benefit one criterion while compromising the other two.

The purpose of this exercise is to define and agree on what the priorities and con￾straints of the project are so that when “push comes to shove,” the right decisions 
can be made.
There are likely to be natural limits to the extent managers can constrain, enhance, 
or accept any one criterion. It may be acceptable for the project to slip one month 
behind schedule but no further or to exceed the planned budget by as much as $20,000. 
Likewise, it may be desirable to finish a project a month early, but after that cost con￾servation should be the primary goal. Some project managers document these limits as 
part of creating the priority matrix.
In summary, developing a priority matrix for a project before the project begins
is a useful exercise. It provides a forum for clearly establishing priorities with cus￾tomers and top management so as to create shared expectations and avoid misun￾derstandings. The priority information is essential to the planning process, where 
adjustments can be made in the scope, schedule, and budget allocation. Finally, 
the matrix is useful midway in the project for approaching a problem that must 
be solved.
One caveat must be mentioned; during the course of a project, priorities may 
change. The customer may suddenly need the project completed one month sooner, 
or new directives from top management may emphasize cost-saving initiatives. The 
project manager needs to be vigilant in order to anticipate and confirm changes in 
priorities and make appropriate adjustments.
4.3 Step 3: Creating the Work Breakdown Structure
Major Groupings in a WBS
Once the scope and deliverables have been identified, the work of the project can 
be successively subdivided into smaller and smaller work elements. The outcome 
of this hierarchical process is called the work breakdown structure (WBS).
Use of a WBS helps to assure project managers that all products and work ele￾ments are identified, to integrate the project with the current organization, and to 
establish a basis for control. Basically, the WBS is an outline of the project with 
different levels of detail.

Figure 4.3 shows the major groupings commonly used in the field to develop 
a hierarchical WBS. The WBS begins with the project as the final deliverable. 
Major  project work deliverables/systems are identified first; then the subdeliv￾erables necessary to accomplish the larger deliverables are defined. The process 
is repeated until the subdeliverable detail is small enough to be manageable and 
one person can be responsible. This subdeliverable is further divided into work 
packages. Because the lowest subdeliverable usually includes several work pack￾ages, the work packages are grouped by type of work—for example, design and 
testing. These groupings within a subdeliverable are called cost accounts. This 
grouping facilitates a system for monitoring project progress by work, cost, and 
responsibility. 
How a WBS Helps the Project Manager
The WBS defines all the elements of the project in a hierarchical framework and 
establishes their relationships to the project end item(s). Think of the project as a large 
work package that is successively broken down into smaller work packages; the total 
project is the summation of all the smaller work packages. This hierarchical structure 
facilitates the evaluation of cost, time, and technical performance at all levels in the

*This breakdown groups work packages by type of work within a deliverable and allows assign￾ment of responsibility to an organization unit. This extra step facilitates a system for monitoring 
project progress (discussed in Chapter 13).

lar60886_ch04_109-139.indd 120 08/23/23 12:46 pm
organization over the life of the project. The WBS also provides management with 
information appropriate to each level. For example, top management deals primarily 
with major deliverables, while first-line supervisors deal with smaller subdeliverables 
and work packages.
Each item in the WBS needs a time and cost estimate. With this information, it is 
possible to plan, schedule, and budget the project. The WBS also serves as a frame￾work for tracking cost and work performance.
As the WBS is developed, organization units and individuals are assigned respon￾sibility for executing work packages. This integrates the work and the organization. 
In practice, this process is sometimes called the organization breakdown structure 
(OBS), which will be further discussed later in the chapter.
Use of the WBS provides the opportunity to “roll up” (sum) the budget and actual 
costs of the smaller work packages into larger work elements so that performance can 
be measured by organization units and work accomplishment.
The WBS can also be used to define communication channels and assist in under￾standing and coordinating many parts of the project. The structure shows the work 
and responsible organization units and suggests where written communication should 
be directed. Problems can be quickly addressed and coordinated because the structure 
integrates work and responsibility.
A Simple WBS Development
Figure 4.4 shows a simplified WBS to develop a new prototype tablet computer. At 
the top of the chart (level 1) is the project end item—the E-Slim Tablet x-13 Proto￾type. The subdeliverable levels (2–5) below level 1 represent further decomposition of 
work. The levels of the structure can also represent information for different levels 
of management. For example, level 1 information represents the total project objective 
and is useful to top management; levels 2, 3, and 4 are suitable for middle manage￾ment; and level 5 is for first-line managers. 
In Figure 4.4, level 2 indicates there are two major deliverables—Hardware and 
CPU, or central processing unit. (There are likely to be other major deliverables such 
as software, but for illustrative purposes we are limiting our focus to just two major 
deliverables.) At level 3, the CPU is connected to three deliverables—Power Supply, 
Flash ROM, and I/O Controller. I/O Controller has three subdeliverables at level 4—
USB Slots, Internet, and Touch Screen. The many subdeliverables for USB Slots and 
Internet have not been decomposed. Touch Screen (shaded) has been decomposed 
down to level 5 and to the work package level.
Note that level 2, Hardware, skips levels 3 and 4 because the final subdeliverables 
can be pushed down to the lowest manageable level 5; skipping levels 3 and 4 suggests 
little coordination is needed and skilled team members are already familiar with the 
work needed to complete the level 5 subdeliverables. For example, Hardware requires 
four subdeliverables at level 5—Frame, Cameras, Speakers, and Antenna. Each subde￾liverable includes work packages that will be completed by an assigned organization 
unit. Observe that the Cameras subdeliverable includes four work packages—WP-C1, 
2, 3, and 4. Back Light, a subdeliverable of Touch Screen, includes three work 
packages—WP-L 1, 2, and 3.
The lowest level of the WBS is called a work package. Work packages are short￾duration tasks that have a definite start and stop point, consume resources, and

represent cost. Each work package is a control point. A work package manager is 
responsible for seeing that the package is completed on time, within budget, and 
according to technical specifications. Practice suggests a work package should not 
exceed 10 workdays or one reporting period. If a work package has a duration exceed￾ing 10 days, check or monitoring points should be established within the duration—
say, every three to five days—so progress and problems can be identified before too 
much time has passed. Each work package of the WBS should be as independent of 
other packages of the project as possible. No work package is described in more than 
one subdeliverable of the WBS.
There is an important difference from start to finish between the last work 
breakdown subdeliverable and a work package. Typically a work breakdown subde￾liverable includes the outcomes of more than one work package from perhaps two or 
three departments. Therefore, the subdeliverable does not have a duration of its own 
and does not consume resources or cost money directly. (In a sense, of course, a dura￾tion for a particular work breakdown element can be derived from identifying which 
work package must start first [earliest] and which package will be the latest to finish; 
the difference from start to finish becomes the duration for the subdeliverable.) The 
higher elements are used to identify deliverables at different phases in the project 
and to develop status reports during the execution stage of the project life cycle. 
Thus, the work package is the basic unit used for planning, scheduling, and controlling 
the project.
In summary, each work package in the WBS
1. Defines work (what).
2. Identifies time to complete a work package (how long).
3. Identifies a time-phased budget to complete a work package (cost).
4. Identifies resources needed to complete a work package (how much).
5. Identifies a single person responsible for units of work (who).
6. Identifies monitoring points for measuring progress (how well).
Creating a WBS from scratch can be a daunting task. Project managers should take 
advantage of relevant examples from previous projects to begin the process.
WBSs are products of group efforts. If the project is small, the entire project team 
may be involved in breaking down the project into its components. For large, complex 
projects, the people responsible for the major deliverables are likely to meet to estab￾lish the first two levels of deliverables. In turn, further detail would be delegated to the 
people responsible for the specific work. Collectively this information would be gath￾ered and integrated into a formal WBS by a project support person. The final version 
would be reviewed by the inner echelon of the project team. Relevant stakeholders 
(most notably customers) would be consulted to confirm agreement and revise when 
appropriate.
Project teams developing their first WBS frequently forget that the structure should 
be end-item, output oriented. First attempts often result in a WBS that follows the 
organization structure—design, marketing, production, and finance. If a WBS follows 
the  organization structure, the focus will be on the organization function and  pro￾cesses, rather than the project output or deliverables. In addition, a WBS with a 
process focus will become an accounting tool that records costs by function rather than 
a tool for “output” management. Every effort should be made to develop a WBS that 
is output oriented in order to concentrate on concrete deliverables. See Snapshot from 
Practice 4.3: Creating a WBS.

lar60886_ch04_109-139.indd 123 08/23/23 12:46 pm
Figure 4.4 represents the classic WBS 
in which the project is broken down 
to the lowest manageable deliverable 
and subsequent work packages. Many 
situations do not require this level of 
detail. This begs the question of how far you should 
break down the work. There is no set answer to this 
question. However, here are some tips given by project 
managers:
Break down the work until you can do an estimate 
that is accurate enough for your purposes. If you are 
doing a ballpark estimate to see if the project is worthy 
of serious consideration, you probably do not need to 
break it down beyond major deliverables. On the other 
hand, if you are pricing a project to submit a competi￾tive bid, then you are likely to go down to the work 
package level.
The WBS should conform to how you are going to 
schedule work. For example, if assignments are made 
in terms of days, then tasks should be limited as best as 
possible to one day or more to complete. Conversely, 
if hours are the smallest unit for scheduling, then work 
can be broken down to one-hour increments.
Final activities should have clearly defined start/
end events. Avoid open-ended tasks like “research” 
or “market analysis.” Take it down to the next level in 
which deliverables/outcomes are more clearly defined. 
Instead of ending with market analysis, include items 
such as “identify market share,” “list user require￾ments,” or “write a problem statement.”
If accountability and control are important, then 
break the work down so that one individual is clearly 
responsible for the work. For example, instead of stop￾ping at product design, take it to the next level and 
identify specific components of the design (e.g., electri￾cal schematics or power source) that different individu￾als will be responsible for creating.
The bottom line is that the WBS should provide the 
level of detail needed to manage the specific project 
successfully.
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 4.3 Creating a WBS
4.4 Step 4: Integrating the WBS with the Organization
The WBS is used to link the organization units responsible for performing the work. 
In practice, the outcome of this process is the organization breakdown structure 
(OBS). The OBS depicts how the firm has organized to discharge work responsibil￾ity. The purposes of the OBS are to provide a framework to summarize organization 
unit work performance, identify the organization units responsible for work packages, 
and tie the organization unit to cost control accounts. Recall that, cost accounts group 
similar work packages (usually under the purview of a department). The OBS defines 
the organization subdeliverables in a hierarchical pattern in successively smaller and 
smaller units. Frequently the traditional organization structure can be used. Even if 
the project is completely performed by a team, it is necessary to break down the team 
structure for assigning responsibility for budgets, time, and technical performance.
As in the WBS, the OBS assigns the lowest organization unit the responsibility 
for work packages within a cost account. Herein lies one major strength of using the 
WBS and OBS; they can be integrated as shown in Figure 4.5. The intersection of 
work packages and the organization unit creates a project control point (cost account)
that integrates work and responsibility. For example, at level 5, Touch Sensors has 
three work packages that have been assigned to the Design, Quality Control Test, and 
Production Departments. The intersection of the WBS and OBS represents the set of 
work packages necessary to complete the subdeliverable located immediately above 
and the organization unit on the left responsible for accomplishing the packages at the 
intersection. Note that the Design Department is responsible for five different work 
packages across the Hardware and Touch Screen deliverables.

Later we will use the intersection as a cost account for management control of proj￾ects. For example, the Cameras element requires the completion of work packages whose 
primary responsibility will include the Design, QC Test, Production, and Outsourcing 
Departments. Control can be checked from two directions—outcomes and responsibility. 
In the execution phase of the project, progress can be tracked vertically on deliverables 
(client’s interest) and tracked horizontally by organization responsibility (owner’s interest).
4.5 Step 5: Coding the WBS for the Information System
Gaining the maximum usefulness of a breakdown structure depends on a coding 
system. The codes are used to define levels and elements in the WBS, organization 
elements, work packages, and budget and cost information. The codes allow reports 
to be consolidated at any level in the structure. The most commonly used scheme in 
practice is numeric indention. A portion of the E-Slim Tablet x-13 Prototype project is 
presented in Exhibit 4.1. 
EXHIBIT 4.1

Microsoft Project
Final PDF to printer126 Chapter 4 Defining the Project
lar60886_ch04_109-139.indd 126 08/23/23 12:46 pm
Note that the project identification is 1.0. Each successive indention represents a 
lower element or work package. Ultimately the numeric scheme reaches down to the 
work package level, and all tasks and elements in the structure have an identification 
code. The “cost account” is the focal point because all budgets, work assignments, 
time, cost, and technical performance come together at this point.
This coding system can be extended to cover large projects. Additional schemes 
can be added for special reports. For example, adding a “23” after the code could 
indicate a site location, an elevation, or a special account such as labor. Some letters 
can be used as special identifiers such as “M” for materials or “E” for engineers. You 
are not limited to only 10 subdivisions (0–9); you can extend each subdivision to large 
numbers—for example, 0.1–0.99 or 0.1–0.9999. If the project is small, you can use 
whole numbers. The following example is from a large, complex project:
3R−237A−P2−33.6
where 3R identifies the facility, 237A represents elevation and the area, P2 represents 
pipe 2 inches wide, and 33.6 represents the work package number. In practice, most 
organizations are creative in combining letters and numbers to minimize the length of 
WBS codes.
On larger projects, the WBS is further supported with a WBS dictionary that pro￾vides detailed information about each element in the WBS. The dictionary typically 
includes the work package level (code), name, and functional description. In some 
cases, the description is supported with specifications. The availability of detailed 
descriptions has an added benefit of dampening scope creep.
4.6 Process Breakdown Structure
The WBS is best suited for design and build projects that have tangible outcomes 
such as an offshore mining facility or a new car prototype. The project can be decom￾posed, or broken down, into major deliverables, subdeliverables, further subdeliv￾erables, and ultimately work packages. It is more difficult to apply WBS to less 
tangible, process-oriented projects in which the final outcome is a product of a series 
of steps or phases. Here, the big difference is that the project evolves over time with 
each phase affecting the next phase. Information systems projects typically fall in this 
category—for example, creating an extranet website or an internal software database 
system. Process projects are driven by performance requirements, not by plans/blue￾prints. Some practitioners choose to utilize a process breakdown structure (PBS)
instead of the classic WBS.
Figure 4.6 provides an example of a PBS for a software development project. 
Instead of being organized around deliverables, the project is organized around phases. 
Each of the five major phases can be broken down into more specific activities until a 
sufficient level of detail is achieved to communicate what needs to be done to com￾plete that phase. People can be assigned to specific activities, and a complementary 
OBS can be created, just as is done for the WBS. Deliverables are not ignored but are 
defined as outputs required to move to the next phase. The software industry often 
refers to a PBS as the “waterfall method,” since progress flows downward through 
each phase.1

Checklists that contain the phase exit requirements are developed to manage proj￾ect progress. These checklists provide the means to support phase walk-throughs and 
reviews. Checklists vary depending upon the project and activities involved but typi￾cally include the following details:
∙ Deliverables needed to exit a phase and begin a new one.
∙ Quality checkpoints to ensure that deliverables are complete and accurate.
∙ Sign-offs by all responsible stakeholders to indicate that the phase has been suc￾cessfully completed and that the project should move on to the next phase.
As long as exit requirements are firmly established and deliverables for each phase are 
well defined, the PBS provides a suitable alternative to the standard WBS for projects 
that involve extensive development work.
4.7 Responsibility Matrices
In many cases, the size and scope of the project do not warrant an elaborate WBS 
or OBS. One tool that is widely used by project managers and task force leaders of 
small projects is the responsibility matrix (RM). The RM (sometimes called a linear

responsibility chart) summarizes the tasks to be accomplished and who is responsible 
for what on a project. In its simplest form, an RM consists of a chart listing all the proj￾ect activities and the participants responsible for each activity. For example, Figure 4.7 
illustrates an RM for a market research study. In this matrix, the R is used to identify 
the committee member who is responsible for coordinating the efforts of other team 
members assigned to the task and making sure that the task is completed. The S is 
used to identify members of the five-person team who will support and/or assist the 
individual responsible. Simple RMs like this one are useful not only for organizing 
and assigning responsibilities for small projects but also for subprojects of large, more 
complex projects.
More complex RMs not only identify individual responsibilities but also clarify 
critical interfaces between units and individuals that require coordination. For exam￾ple, Figure 4.8 is an RM for a larger, more complex project to develop a new piece of 
automated equipment. Notice that within each cell a numeric coding scheme is used to 
define the nature of involvement in that specific task. Such an RM extends the WBS/
OBS and provides a clear and concise method for depicting responsibility, authority, 
and communication channels. 
Responsibility matrices provide a means for all participants in a project to view 
their responsibilities and agree on their assignments. They also help clarify the 
extent or type of authority exercised by each participant in performing an activity 
in which two or more parties have overlapping involvement. By using an RM and 
by defining authority, responsibility, and communications within its framework, the 
relationship between different organization units and the work content of the project 
is made clear.

4.8 Project Communication Plan
Once the project deliverables and work are clearly identified, creating an internal com￾munication plan is vital. Stories abound of poor communication as a major contribu￾tor to project failure. Having a robust communication plan can go a long way toward 
mitigating project problems and can ensure that customers, team members, and other 
stakeholders have the information to do their jobs.
The communication plan is usually created by the project manager and/or the proj￾ect team in the early stage of project planning.
Communication is a key component in coordinating and tracking project sched￾ules, issues, and action items. The plan maps out the flow of information to different 
stakeholders and becomes an integral part of the overall project plan. The purpose of 
a project communication plan is to express what, who, how, and when information 
will be transmitted to project stakeholders so schedules, issues, and action items can 
be tracked.
Project communication plans address the following core questions:
∙ What information needs to be collected and when?
∙ Who will receive the information?
∙ What methods will be used to gather and store information?
∙ What are the limits, if any, on who has access to certain kinds of information?
∙ When will the information be communicated?
∙ How will it be communicated?
Developing a communication plan that answers these questions usually entails the fol￾lowing basic steps:
1. Stakeholder analysis. Identify the target groups. Typical groups could be the cus￾tomer, sponsor, project team, project office, or anyone else who needs project 
information to make decisions and/or contribute to project progress. A common 
tool found in practice to initially identify and analyze major project stakeholders’ 
communication needs is presented in Figure 4.9.2
 What is communicated and how 
are influenced by stakeholder interest and power. Some of these stakeholders may

have the power to either block or enhance your project. By identifying stakehold￾ers and prioritizing them on the “Power/Interest” map, you can plan the type and 
frequency of communications needed. (More on stakeholders will be discussed in 
Chapter 10.)
For example, on a typical project, you want to manage closely the professionals 
doing the work, while you want to satisfy senior management and the project spon￾sor with periodic updates. Unions and operation managers interested in capacity 
should be kept informed, while you would only need to provide general information 
to the legal, public relations, and other departments.
2. Information needs. What information is pertinent to stakeholders who contrib￾ute to the project’s progress? The simplest answer to this question can be obtained 
by asking the various individuals what information they need and when they need 
it. For example, top management needs to know how the project is progressing, 
whether it is encountering critical problems, and the extent to which project goals 
are being realized. This information is required so that they can make strategic 
decisions and manage the portfolio of projects. Project team members need to see 
schedules, task lists, specifications, and the like so they know what needs to be 
done next. External groups need to know any changes in the schedule and perfor￾mance requirements of the components they are providing. Frequent information 
needs found in communication plans are
Project status reports Deliverable issues
Changes in scope Team status meetings
Gating decisions Accepted request changes
Action items Milestone reports
3. Sources of information. When the information needs are identified, the next step 
is to determine the sources of information. That is, where does the information 
reside? How will it be collected? For example, information relating to the milestone 
report, team meetings, and project status meetings would be found in the minutes 
and reports of various groups.
4. Dissemination modes. In today’s world, traditional status report meetings are 
being supplemented by e-mail, teleconferencing, SharePoint, and a variety of data￾base sharing programs to circulate information. In particular, many companies are 
using the cloud database to create a “virtual project office” to store project informa￾tion. Project management software feeds information directly to the cloud platform 
so that different people have immediate access to relevant project information. In 
some cases, appropriate information is routed automatically to key stakeholders. 
Backup paper hardcopy to specific stakeholders is still critical for many project 
changes and action items.
5. Responsibility and timing. Determine who will send out the information. For 
example, a common practice is to have the note taker of meetings forward the min￾utes or specific information to the appropriate stakeholders. In some cases, the 
responsibility lies with the project manager or project office. Timing and frequency 
of distribution appropriate to the information need to be established.
The advantage of establishing a communication plan is that instead of responding to 
information requests, you are controlling the flow of information. This reduces confusion

Summary The project scope definition, priorities, and work breakdown structure are the 
keys to nearly every aspect of managing the project. The scope definition provides 
focus and emphasis on the end item(s) of the project. Establishing project priori￾ties allows managers to make appropriate trade-off decisions. The WBS structure 
helps ensure that all tasks of the project are identified and provides two views of 
the project—one on deliverables and one on organization responsibility. The WBS 
avoids having the project driven by organization function or by a finance system. 
The structure forces attention to realistic requirements of personnel, hardware, 
and unnecessary interruptions, and it can provide project managers greater autonomy. 
Why? By reporting on a regular basis how things are going and what is happening, you 
allow senior management to feel more comfortable about letting the team complete the 
project without interference. See Figure 4.10 for a sample Shale Oil research project 
communication plan.
The importance of establishing a plan up front for communicating important proj￾ect information cannot be overstated. Many of the problems that plague a project can 
be traced back to insufficient time devoted to establishing a well-grounded internal 
communication plan.
Final PDF to printerChapter 4 Defining the Project 133

and budgets. Use of the structure provides a powerful framework for project con￾trol that identifies deviations from the plan, identifies responsibility, and spots 
areas for improved performance. No well-developed project plan or control system 
is possible without a disciplined, structured approach. The WBS, OBS, and cost 
account codes provide this discipline. The WBS serves as the database for devel￾oping the project network, which establishes the timing of work, people, equip￾ment, and costs.
The PBS is often used for process-based projects with ill-defined deliverables. In 
small projects, responsibility matrices may be used to clarify individual responsibility.
Clearly defining your project is the first and most important step in planning. The 
absence of a clearly defined project plan consistently shows up as the major reason for 
project failures. Whether you use a WBS, PBS, or responsibility matrix will depend 
primarily on the size and nature of your project. Whatever method you use, definition 
of your project should be adequate to allow for good control as the project is being 
implemented. Follow-up with a clear communication plan for coordinating and track￾ing project progress will help you keep important stakeholders informed and avoid 
some potential problems.

Celebration of Colors 5K
Jamal was having an ale with his girlfriend, Sierra, when the subject of the Omega 
Theta Pi 5K-run project came up. Jamal has been chosen to chair the 5K-charity 
run for his fraternity. At the time, Jamal thought it would look good on his resume 
and wouldn’t be too difficult to pull off. This would be the first running event 
Final PDF to printerChapter 4 Defining the Project 137

Omega  Theta  Pi had organized. In the past, Delta Tau Chi always organized the 
spring running event. However, Delta Tau Chi had been dissolved after a highly pub￾licized hazing scandal.
Jamal and his brothers at Omega Theta Pi thought that organizing a 5K-run would 
be a lot more fun and profitable than the normal spring cleaning service they offered 
the local community. Early on in the discussions, everyone agreed that partnering with 
a sorority would be an advantage. Not only would they help manage the event, but 
they would have useful contacts to recruit sponsors and participants. Jamal pitched the 
fundraising idea to the sisters at Delta Nu, and they agreed to co-manage the event. 
Olivia Pomerleau volunteered and was named co-chair by Delta Nu.
Jamal told Sierra about the task force’s first meeting, which was held last night and 
included five members from each living group. Olivia and Jamal tried, but failed, to 
meet beforehand due to scheduling conflicts. The meeting began with the attendees 
introducing themselves and telling what experience they had had with running events. 
Only one person had not run at past events, but no one had been involved in managing 
an event other than volunteering as intersection flaggers.
Olivia then said she thought the first thing they should decide on was the theme of the 
5K-race. Jamal hadn’t thought much about this, but everyone agreed that the race had to 
have a theme. People began to suggest themes and ideas based on other runs they knew 
about. The group seemed stumped when Olivia said, “Do you know that the last Friday 
in March is a full moon? In India, Holi, the celebration of colors, occurs on the last full 
moon day in March. Maybe you’ve seen pictures of this, but this is where people go wild 
tossing dye and color water balloons at each other. I looked it up and the Holi festival 
signifies a victory of good over evil, the arrival of spring and the end of winter. It is a day 
to meet others, play, laugh, and forgive and forget. I think it would be neat if we organized 
our 5K-run as a Holi festival. At different points in the race we would have people toss 
dye on runners. The run would end with a giant water balloon fight. We could even see if 
Evergreen [the local Indian restaurant] would cater the event!”
Jamal and the other boys looked at each other, while the girls immediately sup￾ported the idea. The deal maker occurred when Olivia showed a YouTube video of 
a similar event last year at a university in Canada that had over 700 participants and 
raised over $14,000.
Once the theme was decided the discussion turned into a free-for-all of ideas and 
suggestions. One member said she may know an artist who could create really neat 
T-shirts for the event. Others wondered where to get the dye and if it is safe. Another 
talked about the importance of a website and creating a digital account for registra￾tion. Others began to argue whether the run should be done on campus or through the 
streets of their small college town. One by one students excused themselves due to 
other commitments. With only a few members remaining Jamal and Olivia adjourned 
the meeting.
While Jamal took a sip of his IPA (India Pale Ale) beer, Sierra pulled a book out of 
her knapsack. “Sounds like what you need to do is create what my project management 
professor calls a WBS for your project.” She pointed to a page in her project manage￾ment textbook showing a diagram of a WBS.
1. Make a list of the major deliverables for the 5k-run color project and use them to 
develop a draft of the work breakdown structure for the project that contains, when 
appropriate, at least three levels of detail.
2. How would developing a WBS alleviate some of the problems that occurred during 
the first meeting and help Jamal organize and plan the project?

Case 4.2
The Home Improvement Project
Lukas Nelson and his partner, Anne, and their three daughters had been living in 
their house for over five years when they decided it was time to make some modest 
improvements. One area they both agreed needed an upgrade was the bathtub. Their 
current house had one standard shower/bathtub combination. Lukas was 6 feet four 
and could barely squeeze into it. In fact, he had taken only one bath since they moved 
in. He and Anne both missed soaking in the older, deep bathtubs they enjoyed when 
they lived back East.
Fortunately, the previous owners, who had built the house, had plumbed the corner 
of a large exercise room in the basement for a hot tub. They contacted a trusted remod￾eling contractor, who assured them it would be relatively easy to install a new bathtub 
and it shouldn’t cost more than $2,500. They decided to go ahead with the project.
First, the Nelsons went to the local plumbing retailer to pick out a tub. They soon 
realized that for a few hundred dollars more they could buy a big tub with water jets 
(a Jacuzzi). With old age on the horizon a Jacuzzi seemed like a luxury that was worth 
the extra money.
Originally the plan was to install the tub using the simple plastic frame the bath 
came with and install a splash guard around the tub. Once Anne saw the tub, frame, 
and splashguard in the room she balked. She did not like how it looked with the cedar 
paneling in the exercise room. After significant debate, Anne won out, and the Nelsons 
agreed to pay extra to have a cedar frame built for the tub and use attractive tile instead 
of the plastic splashguard. Lukas rationalized that the changes would pay for them￾selves when they tried to sell the house.
The next hiccup occurred when it came time to address the flooring issue. The exer￾cise room was carpeted, which wasn’t ideal when getting out of a bathtub. The original 
idea was to install relatively cheap laminated flooring in the drying and undressing 
area adjacent to the tub. However, the Nelsons couldn’t agree on the pattern to use. 
One of Anne’s friends said it would be a shame to put such cheap flooring in such a 
nice room. Her friend felt they should consider using tile. The contractor agreed and 
said he knew a tile installer who needed work and would give them a good deal.
Lukas reluctantly agreed that the laminated options just didn’t fit the style or quality 
of the exercise room. Unlike the laminated floor debate, both Anne and Lukas imme￾diately liked a tile pattern that matched the tile used around the tub. Anxious not to 
delay the project, they agreed to pay for the tile flooring.
Once the tub was installed and the framing was almost completed, Anne realized 
that something had to be done about the lighting. One of her favorite things to do was 
to read while soaking in the tub. The existing lights didn’t provide sufficient illumina￾tion for doing so. Lukas knew this was “nonnegotiable” and they hired an electrician 
to install additional lighting over the bathtub.
While the lighting was being installed and the tile was being laid, another issue 
came up. The original plan was to tile only the exercise room and use remnant rugs to 
cover the area away from the tub where the Nelsons did their exercises. The Nelsons 
were very happy with how the tile looked and fit with the overall room. However, it 
clashed with the laminated flooring in the adjacent bathroom. Lukas agreed with Anne 
that it really made the adjacent bathroom look cheap and ugly. He also felt the bath￾room was so small it wouldn’t cost much more.

lar60886_ch04_109-139.indd 139 08/23/23 12:46 pm
After a week, the work was completed. Both Lukas and Anne were quite pleased 
with how everything turned out. It cost much more than they had planned, but they 
planned to live in the house until the girls graduated from college, so they felt it was a 
good long-term investment.
Anne had the first turn using the bathtub, followed by their three girls. Everyone 
enjoyed the Jacuzzi. It was 10:00 p.m. when Lukas began running water for his first 
bath. At first the water was steaming hot, but by the time he was about to get in, it was 
lukewarm at best. Lukas groaned, “After paying all of that money I still can’t enjoy 
a bath.”
The Nelsons rationed bathing for a couple weeks, until they decided to find out 
what, if anything, could be done about the hot water problem. They asked a reputable 
heating contractor to assess the situation. The contractor reported that the hot water 
tank was insufficient to service a family of five. This had not been discovered before 
because baths were rarely taken in the past. The contractor said it would cost $2,800 
to replace the existing water heater with a larger one that would meet their needs. The 
heating contractor also said if they wanted to do it right they should replace the exist￾ing furnace with a more energy-efficient one. A new furnace would not only heat the 
house but also indirectly heat the water tank. Such a furnace would cost $11,500, but 
with the improved efficiency and savings in the gas bill, the furnace would pay for 
itself in 10 years. Besides, the Nelsons would likely receive tax credits for the more 
fuel-efficient furnace.
Three weeks later, after the new furnace was installed, Lukas settled into the new 
bathtub. He looked around the room at all the changes that had been made and mut￾tered to himself, “And to think that all I wanted was to soak in a nice, hot bath.”
1. What factors and forces contributed to scope creep in this case?
2. Is this an example of good or bad scope creep? Explain.
3. How could scope creep have been better managed by the Nelsons?

Plans are of little importance, but planning is essential.
— Winston Churchill, former British prime minister
Estimating is the process of forecasting or approximating the time and cost of complet￾ing project deliverables. Estimating processes are frequently classified as top-down 
and bottom-up. Top-down estimates are usually done by senior management. Man￾agement will often derive estimates from analogy, group consensus, or mathemati￾cal relationships. Bottom-up estimates are typically performed by the people who are 
doing the work. Their estimates are based on estimates of elements found in the work 
breakdown structure. Exhibit 5.1 summarizes some of the key reasons for estimating.
All project stakeholders prefer accurate cost and time estimates, but they also 
understand the inherent uncertainty in all projects. Inaccurate estimates lead to false 
expectations and consumer dissatisfaction. Accuracy is improved with greater effort, 
but is it worth the time and cost? Estimating costs money! Project estimating becomes 
a trade-off, balancing the benefits of better accuracy against the costs for securing 
increased accuracy.
Cost, time, and budget estimates are the lifeline for control; they serve as the stan￾dard for comparison of actual and plan throughout the life of the project. Project status 
reports depend on reliable estimates as the major input for measuring variances and

Why Estimating 
Time and Cost Is 
Important
• Estimates are needed to support good decisions.
• Estimates are needed to schedule work.
• Estimates are needed to determine how long the project should take and its cost.

taking corrective action. Ideally, the project manager, and in most cases the customer, 
would prefer to have a database of detailed schedule and cost estimates for every work 
package in the project. Regrettably, such detailed data gathering is not always possible 
or practical, and other methods are used to develop project estimates.
Estimates are a quantitative assessment of the likely outcome or amount of a vari￾able like cost, duration, number of people required, etc. As the project evolves esti￾mates are likely to change based on current information and circumstances. Four 
different aspects of estimating include (PMI, 2021):
1. Range. Range refers to the number of potential outcomes that could be expected to 
occur. For example, your building contractor reports that work will take between 10 
and 15 days versus 11 and 13 days. Or the cost will be between $2,000 and $3,000.
2. Accuracy. Accuracy refers to the correctness of an estimate. For example, if your 
building contractor completes the work in 9 days then despite being done early the 
estimate was not accurate. Conversely, an accurate estimate would be one when 
you are told the work will cost $2,500 and you receive a bill for $2,500 instead of 
$2,450. Accuracy is linked to range in that the lower the accuracy the larger the 
number potential outcomes.
3. Precision. Precision refers to the degree of exactness associated with the estimate. 
For example, your contractor reports the work will be done in 15 days instead of 
“by the end of the month.” Or the work should cost $850 instead of less than a 
thousand. Precision is different from accuracy in that you can have a very detailed 
estimate that is far off the mark.
4. Confidence. Confidence refers to the degree of trust one has in the estimate. While 
we would be remiss not to acknowledge that confidence is often based on a “gut 
feel,” it is usually linked to probability. Your contractor is 90 percent sure that the 
work will be done by Friday, or there is less than a fifty-fifty (50/50) chance we can 
get the work done for under $2,000.
As a project progresses, there should be an improvement in the quality of esti￾mates. During the defining stage, estimates will be less precise, accurate, and have a 
broad range with limited confidence. During the execution stage, one can factor past 
performance, workforce dynamics, and a better understanding of the challenges into 
estimates. This information should yield more precise, accurate estimates with greater 
confidence.
5.1 Factors Influencing the Quality of Estimates
A typical statement in the field is the desire to “have a 95 percent probability of meet￾ing time and cost estimates.” Past experience is a good starting point for developing 
time and cost estimates. But past experience estimates must almost always be refined 
by other considerations to reach the 95 percent probability level. Factors related to the 
uniqueness of the project will have a strong influence on the accuracy of estimates. 
Project, people, and external factors all need to be considered to improve the quality of 
estimates for project times and costs.
Planning Horizon
The quality of the estimate depends on the planning horizon; estimates of current 
events are close to 100 percent accurate but are reduced for more distant events. For 
example, cost estimates for a party you are organizing this weekend should be much

more accurate than the estimates for a party that will take place in six months. Now 
imagine how difficult it would be to estimate the total cost of a four-year transporta￾tion project. The accuracy of time and cost estimates should improve as you move 
from the conceptual phase to the point where individual work packages are defined.
Project Complexity
Time to implement new technology has a habit of expanding in an increasing, nonlin￾ear fashion. Sometimes poorly written scope specifications for new technology result 
in errors in estimating times and costs.
People
The people factor can influence the quality of time and cost estimates. For example, 
accuracy of estimates depends on the skills of the people making the estimates. How 
familiar are they with the task they are estimating?
Project Structure and Organization
Which project structure is chosen to manage the project will influence time and cost 
estimates. One of the major advantages of a dedicated project team is the speed gained 
from concentrated focus and localized project decisions. This speed comes at an addi￾tional cost of tying up personnel full time. Conversely, projects operating in a matrix 
environment may reduce costs by more efficiently sharing personnel across projects 
but may take longer to complete, since attention is divided and coordination demands 
are higher.
Padding Estimates
In some cases, people are inclined to pad estimates. For example, if you are asked how 
long it takes you to drive to the airport, you might give an average time of 30 minutes, 
assuming a 50/50 chance of getting there in 30 minutes. If you are asked the fastest 
you could possibly get there, you might reduce the driving time to 20 minutes. Finally, 
if you are asked how long the drive would take if you absolutely had to be there to 
meet with the president, it is likely you would increase the estimate to, say, 50 minutes 
to ensure not being late.
In work situations where we are asked for time and cost estimates, most of us are 
inclined to add a little padding to reduce the risk of being late. If everyone at all levels 
of the project adds a little padding to reduce risk, the project duration and cost are 
seriously overstated. This phenomenon causes some managers or owners to call for a 
10–15 percent cut in time and/or cost for the project. Of course, the next time the game 
is played, the person estimating cost and/or time will pad the estimate to 20 percent 
or more. Clearly, such games defeat chances for realistic estimates, which is what is 
needed to be competitive.
Organizational Culture
Organizational culture can significantly influence project estimates. In some organiza￾tions, padding estimates are tolerated and even privately encouraged. Other organiza￾tions place a premium on accuracy and strongly discourage estimating gamesmanship. 
Organizations vary in the importance they attach to estimates. The prevailing belief in 
some organizations is that detailed estimating takes too much time and is not worth 
the effort or that it’s impossible to predict the future. Other organizations subscribe 
to the belief that accurate estimates are the bedrock of effective project management.

lar60886_ch05_140-174.indd 144 09/01/23 06:36 pm
Organizational culture shapes every dimension of project management; estimating is 
not immune to this influence.
Other Factors
Finally, nonproject factors can impact time and cost estimates. For example, equip￾ment downtime can alter time estimates. National holidays, vacations, and legal limits 
can influence project estimates. Project priority can influence resource assignment 
and impact time and cost.
Project estimating is a complex process. The quality of time and cost estimates can 
be improved when these variables are considered in making the estimates. Estimates 
of time and cost together allow the manager to develop a time-phased budget, which is 
imperative for project control. Before discussing macro and micro estimating methods 
for times and costs, a review of estimating guidelines will remind us of some of the 
important “rules of the game” that can improve estimating.
5.2 Estimating Guidelines for Times, Costs, and Resources
Managers recognize time, cost, and resource estimates must be accurate if project 
planning, scheduling, and controlling are to be effective. However, there is substantial 
evidence suggesting poor estimates are a major contributor to projects that have failed. 
Therefore, every effort should be made to see that initial estimates are as accurate as 
possible, since the choice of no estimates leaves a great deal to luck and is not palat￾able to serious project managers. Even though a project has never been done before, a 
manager can follow seven guidelines to develop useful work package estimates.
1. Responsibility. At the work package level, estimates should be made by the person(s) 
most familiar with the task. Draw on their expertise! Except for supertechnical tasks, 
those responsible for getting the job done on schedule and within budget are usually 
first-line supervisors or technicians who are experienced and familiar with the type 
of work involved. These people will not have some preconceived, imposed duration 
for a deliverable in mind. They will give an estimate based on experience and best 
judgment. A secondary benefit of using those responsible is the hope they will “buy 
in” to seeing that the estimate materializes when they implement the work package. 
If those involved are not consulted, it will be difficult to hold them responsible for 
failure to achieve the estimated time. Finally, drawing on the expertise of team mem￾bers who will be responsible helps to build communication channels early.
2. The use of several people to estimate. It is well known that a cost or time estimate 
usually has a better chance of being reasonable and realistic when several people 
with relevant experience and/or knowledge of the task are used (sometimes called 
“crowdsourcing”). True, people bring different biases based on their experience. 
But discussion of the individual differences in their estimate leads to consensus and 
tends to eliminate extreme estimate errors.
3. Normal conditions. When task time, cost, and resource estimates are determined, 
they are based on certain assumptions. Estimates should be based on normal con￾ditions, efficient methods, and a normal level of resources. Normal conditions are 
sometimes difficult to discern, but it is necessary to have a consensus in the organiza￾tion as to what normal conditions mean in this project. If the normal workday is eight 
hours, the time estimate should be based on an eight-hour day. Similarly, if the normal 
workday is two shifts, the time estimate should be based on a two-shift workday. Any 
time estimate should reflect efficient methods for the resources normally available. 
LO 5-3
Describe guidelines for 
estimating time, costs, 
and resources.

lar60886_ch05_140-174.indd 145 09/01/23 06:36 pm
The time estimate should represent the normal level of resources—people or equip￾ment. For example, if three programmers are available for coding or two road 
graders are available for road construction, time and cost estimates should be based 
on these normal levels of resources unless it is anticipated the project will change 
what is currently viewed as “normal.” In addition, possible conflicts in demand for 
resources on parallel or concurrent activities should not be considered at this stage. 
The need for adding resources will be examined when resource scheduling is dis￾cussed in a later chapter.
4. Time units. Specific time units to use should be selected early in the develop￾ment phase of the project network. All task time estimates need consistent time 
units. Estimates of time must consider whether normal time is represented by cal￾endar days, workdays, workweeks, person days, single shift, hours, minutes, etc. 
In practice, the use of workdays is the dominant choice for expressing task dura￾tion. However, in projects such as a heart transplant operation, minutes probably 
would be more appropriate as a time unit. One such project that used minutes as the 
time unit was the movement of patients from an old hospital to an elegant new one 
across town. Since there were several life-endangering moves, minutes were used 
to ensure patient safety so that proper emergency life-support systems would be 
available if needed. The point is, network analysis requires a standard unit of time. 
When computer programs allow more than one option, some notation should be 
made of any variance from the standard unit of time. If the standard unit of time is 
a five-day workweek and the estimated activity duration is in calendar days, it must 
be converted to the normal workweek.
5. Independence. Estimators should treat each task as independent of other tasks that 
might be integrated by the WBS. Use of first-line managers usually results in con￾sidering tasks independently; this is good. Top managers are prone to aggregate 
many tasks into one time estimate and then deductively make the individual task 
time estimates add to the total. If tasks are in a chain and performed by the same 
group or department, it is best not to ask for all the time estimates in the sequence 
at once to avoid the tendency for a planner or a supervisor to look at the whole path 
and try to adjust individual task times in the sequence to meet an arbitrary imposed 
schedule or some rough “guesstimate” of the total time for the whole path or seg￾ment of the project. This tendency does not reflect the uncertainties of individual 
activities and generally results in optimistic task time estimates. In summary, each 
task time estimate should be considered independently of other activities.
6. Contingencies. Work package estimates should not include allowances for contin￾gencies. The estimate should assume normal or average conditions, even though 
every work package will not materialize as planned. For this reason, top manage￾ment needs to create an extra fund for contingencies that can be used to cover 
unforeseen events.
7. Risk assessment added to the estimate to avoid surprises to stakeholders. It is 
obvious some tasks carry more time and cost risks than others. For example, a new 
technology usually carries more time and cost risks than a proven process. Simply 
identifying the degree of risk lets stakeholders consider alternative methods and 
alter process decisions. A simple breakdown by optimistic, most likely, and pes￾simistic for task time could provide valuable information regarding time and cost. 
See Chapter 7 for further discussion of project risk.
Where applicable, these guidelines will greatly help to avoid many of the pitfalls found 
so often in practice.

5.3 Top-Down versus Bottom-Up Estimating
Since estimating efforts cost money, the time and detail devoted to estimating are 
important decisions. Yet when estimating is considered, you as a project manager may 
hear statements such as these:
Rough order of magnitude is good enough. Spending time on detailed estimating 
wastes money.
Time is everything; our survival depends on getting there first! Time and cost 
accuracy is not an issue.
The project is internal. We don’t need to worry about cost.
The project is so small. We don’t need to bother with estimates. Just do it.
However, there are sound reasons for using top-down or bottom-up estimates. Table 5.1 
depicts conditions that suggest when one approach is preferred over another.
Top-down estimates usually are derived from someone who uses experience and/or 
information to determine the project duration and total cost. However, these estimates 
are sometimes made by top managers who have very little knowledge of the com￾ponent activities used to complete the project. For example, a mayor of a major city 
making a speech noted that a new law building would be constructed at a cost of 
$23 million and would be ready for occupancy in two and one-half years. Although 
the mayor probably asked for an estimate from someone, the estimate could have come 
from a luncheon meeting with a local contractor who wrote an estimate (guesstimate) 
on a napkin. This is an extreme example, but in a relative sense this scenario is fre￾quently played out in practice. See Snapshot from Practice 5.1: Portland Aerial Tram 
for another example of this. The question actually is, do these estimates represent low￾cost, efficient methods? Seldom. The fact that the estimate came from the top can 
influence people responsible to “do what it takes to make the estimate.”
If possible and practical, you want to push the estimating process down to the work 
package level for bottom-up estimates that establish low-cost, efficient methods. This 
process can take place after the project has been defined in detail. Good sense sug￾gests project estimates should come from the people most knowledgeable about the 
estimate needed. The use of several people with relevant experience with the task can 
improve the time and cost estimate. The bottom-up approach at the work package level 
can serve as a check on cost elements in the WBS by rolling up the work packages and 
associated cost accounts to major deliverables. Similarly, resource requirements can 
be checked. Later, the time, resource, and cost estimates from the work packages can 
be consolidated into time-phased networks, resource schedules, and budgets that are 
used for control.

The Portland Tram is an aerial tram￾way in Portland, Oregon. The tram 
carries passengers between the city’s 
south waterfront and the main Oregon 
Health & Science University (OHSU) 
campus, which is located high on a bluff overlooking 
the waterfront. The tram ride takes four minutes and 
rises over 500 feet. The tram was jointly funded by 
OHSU, the city of Portland, and south waterfront prop￾erty owners.
OHSU was the driving force behind the project. OHSU 
argued that the tram was needed so it could expand its 
operations to the south waterfront, where there were 
plans to build several major facilities. The tram would 
also reduce traffic congestions and make it easier for 
OHSU employees to commute to work. OHSU is a major 
player in the Oregon economy, with an estimated annual 
economic impact of over $4 billion and over 35,000 jobs.
The OHSU tram would be one of only two city trams 
in the United States, and advocates championed the 
idea that the tram would become an icon for the city 
like Seattle’s Space Needle.
OHSU political clout helped gain approval by the 
Portland city council for the project in 2003. The ini￾tial cost estimate was $15 million, with the city directly 
responsible for $2 million. A public review in 2004 
revealed a new cost estimate of $18.5 million. A sec￾ond review in 2005 led to a cost readjustment of $40 
million with a construction delay of six months.
In 2006 a change in city leadership led to an inde￾pendent audit being conducted on the tram project. 
The audit revealed that OSHU managers knew as 
early as 2003 that the cost of the tram would be in 
excess of $15.5 million but withheld the information 
from city officials.
Public reaction was immediate and harsh. City 
Commissioner Randy Leonard accused the OHSU 
leadership of an “outrageous shell game . . . all at the 
expense of taxpayers.” The city of Portland threatened 
to pull out of the project. OHSU protested vigorously, 
threatening a lawsuit, should the tram be canceled. 
Negotiations ensued.

A revised funding plan and budget were agreed 
upon in April 2006, by a 3–2 vote of the city council. This 
plan required concessions from all parties involved and 
called for a final budget of $57 million, with direct contri￾butions from the city of $8.5 million, or nearly 15 percent 
of the overall budget. This final budget was met, and the 
tram was opened to the public on January 27, 2007.
Budget concerns were not the only problem facing 
the tram project. Many residents in the neighborhood 
beneath the tram were concerned that the tram would 
be an invasion of privacy and lead to lower property 
values. The residents were promised that the overhead 
power lines would be buried, but as a cost saving mea￾sure the plans were scrapped. One irate homeowner 
living below the track placed a sign on his backyard 
fence stating “F%&! The Tram.” The sign was not vis￾ible from the street, only from the air. Lawsuits ensued.
The city ultimately negotiated with each resident 
living under the tramway and offered fair market value 
for their homes.

The bottom-up approach also provides the customer with an opportunity to compare 
the low-cost, efficient method approach with any imposed restrictions. For example, 
if the project completion duration is imposed at two years and your bottom-up analysis 
tells you the project will take two and one-half years, the client can now consider the 
trade-off of the low-cost method versus compressing the project to two years—or in 
Final PDF to printer148 Chapter 5 Estimating Project Times and Costs
lar60886_ch05_140-174.indd 148 09/01/23 06:36 pm
rare cases canceling the project. Similar trade-offs can be compared for different levels 
of resources or increases in technical performance. The assumption is any movement 
away from the low-cost, efficient method will increase costs—for example, overtime. 
The preferred approach in defining the project is to make rough top-down estimates, 
develop the WBS/OBS, make bottom-up estimates, develop schedules and budgets, 
and reconcile differences between top-down and bottom-up estimates. These steps 
should be done before final negotiation with either an internal or external customer. 
In conclusion, the ideal approach is for the project manager to allow enough time for 
both the top-down and bottom-up estimates to be worked out so that a complete plan 
based on reliable estimates can be offered to the customer. In this way false expecta￾tions are minimized for all stakeholders and negotiation is reduced.
5.4 Methods for Estimating Project Times and Costs
Top-Down Approaches for Estimating Project Times and Costs
At the strategic level, top-down estimating methods are used to evaluate the project 
proposal. Sometimes much of the information needed to derive accurate time and cost 
estimates is not available in the initial phase of the project—for example, design is not 
finalized. In these situations top-down estimates are used until the tasks in the WBS 
are clearly defined.
Consensus Method
This method simply uses the pooled experience of senior and/or middle managers 
to estimate the total project duration and cost. It typically involves a meeting where 
experts discuss, argue, and ultimately reach a decision as to their best guesstimate. 
Firms seeking greater rigor will use the Delphi Method to make these macro esti￾mates. See Snapshot from Practice 5.2: The Delphi Method.
It is important to recognize that these first top-down estimates are only a rough cut 
and typically occur in the “conceptual” stage of the project. The top-down estimates are 
helpful in initial development of a complete plan. However, such estimates are some￾times significantly off the mark because little detailed information is gathered. At this 
level, individual work items are not identified. Or, in a few cases, the top-down esti￾mates are not realistic because top management “wants the project.” Nevertheless, the 
initial top-down estimates are helpful in determining whether the project warrants more 
formal planning, which would include more detailed estimates. Be careful that macro 
estimates made by senior managers are not dictated to lower-level managers who might 
feel compelled to accept the estimates even if they believe resources are inadequate.
Ratio Method
Top-down methods (sometimes called parametric) usually use ratios, or surrogates, to 
estimate project times or costs. Top-down ratio methods are often used in the con￾cept, or “need,” phase of a project to get an initial duration and cost estimate for the 
project. For example, contractors frequently use number of square feet to estimate 
the cost and time to build a house; that is, a house of 2,700 square feet might cost 
$200 per square foot (2,700 feet × $200 per square foot equals $540,000). Likewise, 
knowing the square feet and dollars per square foot, experience suggests it should take 
approximately 150 days to complete. Two other common examples of top-down cost 
estimates are the cost for a new plant estimated by capacity size and a software product 
estimated by features and complexity.

lar60886_ch05_140-174.indd 149 09/01/23 06:36 pm
Apportion Method
This method is an extension to the ratio method. Apportionment is used when proj￾ects closely follow past projects in features and costs. Given good historical data, esti￾mates can be made quickly with little effort and reasonable accuracy. This method is 
very common in projects that are relatively standard but have some small variation or 
customization.
Anyone who has borrowed money from a bank to build a house has been exposed to 
this process. Given an estimated total cost for the house, banks and the FHA (Federal 
Housing Authority) authorize pay to the contractor by completion of specific segments 
of the house. For example, foundation might represent 3 percent of the total loan, fram￾ing 25 percent, plumbing and heating 15 percent, etc. Payments are made as these items 
are completed. An analogous process is used by some companies that apportion costs to 
deliverables in the WBS—given average cost percentages from past projects. Figure 5.1 
presents an example similar to one found in practice. Assuming the total project cost is 
estimated, using a top-down estimate, to be $500,000, the costs are apportioned as a per￾centage of the total cost. For example, the costs apportioned to the “Document” deliver￾able are 5 percent of the total, or $25,000. The subdeliverables “Doc-1 and Doc-2” are 
allocated 2 and 3 percent of the total—$10,000 and $15,000, respectively. 
Originally developed by the RAND 
Corporation in 1969 for technological 
forecasting, the Delphi Method is a 
group decision process about the like￾lihood that certain events will occur. 
The Delphi Method makes use of a panel of experts 
familiar with the kind of project in question. The 
notion is that well-informed individuals, calling on their 
insights and experience, are better equipped to esti￾mate project costs/times than theoretical approaches 
or statistical methods. Their responses to estimate 
questionnaires are anonymous, and they are provided 
with a summary of opinions.
Experts are then encouraged to reconsider, and if 
appropriate, to change their previous estimate in light 
of the replies of other experts. After two or three rounds 
it is believed that the group will converge toward the 
“best” response through this consensus process. The 
midpoint of responses is statistically categorized by the 
median score. In each succeeding round of question￾naires, the range of responses by the panelists will pre￾sumably decrease and the median will move toward 
what is deemed to be the “correct” estimate.
A movie exec would use the Delphi Method to 
decide whether to invest in the remaking of a classic 
film, like Gunga Din.1
 He is concerned because both 
the screenwriter and director insist on shooting the film

on location in Rajasthan, India. He recruits five experts 
who have worked on film projects overseas, two 
recently in India. He provides each of them with a 
detailed summary proposal that describes the require￾ments as well as the 75-day shooting schedule. He 
asks them to respond to an estimating questionnaire 
concerning the costs of certain deliverables (e.g., 
accommodations, sets) as well as total operational 
costs, ignoring the lead actors’ contracts. He is sur￾prised by the disparity between those who have 
worked in India and the others. After several rounds, 
where opinions and ideas are exchanged, he has a 
fairly good idea of what the total costs are likely to be 
as well as the risks involved. When he combines this 
information with market research, he concludes that 
the project is not worth the investment.
One distinct advantage of the Delphi Method is that 
the experts never need to be brought together physically. 
The process also does not require complete agreement 
by all panelists, since the majority opinion is represented 
by the median. Since the responses are anonymous, the 
pitfalls of ego, domineering personalities, and the band￾wagon or halo effect in responses are all avoided.

three British officers in Rajasthan, India, who, thanks to a 
water boy (Gunga Din), survive a rebel revolt.

Function Point Methods for Software and System Projects
In the software industry, software development projects are frequently estimated 
using weighted macro variables called function points or major parameters such as 
number of inputs, number of outputs, number of inquiries, number of data files, and 
number of interfaces. These weighted variables are adjusted for a complexity factor 
and added. The total adjusted count provides the basis for estimating the labor effort 
and cost for a project (usually using a regression formula derived from data of past 
projects). This latter method assumes adequate historical data by type of software 
project for the industry—for example, MIS systems. In the U.S. software industry, 
one person-month represents on average five function points. A person working one 
month can generate on average (across all types of software projects) about five func￾tion points. Of course, each organization needs to develop its own average for its 
specific type of work. Such historical data provide a basis for estimating the proj￾ect duration. Variations of this top-down approach are used by companies such as 
IBM, Bank of America, Sears Roebuck, HP, AT&T, Ford Motors, GE, DuPont, and 
many others. See Tables 5.2 and 5.3 for a simplified example of function point count 
methodology.
From historical data, the organization developed the weighting scheme for com￾plexity found in Table 5.2. Function points are derived from multiplying the number of 
kinds of elements by weighted complexity.

Table 5.3 shows the data collected for a specific task or deliverable: Patient Admit￾ting and Billing—the number of inputs, outputs, inquiries, files, and interfaces along 
with the expected complexity rating. Finally, the application of the element count is 
applied and the function point count total is 660. Given this count and the fact that 
1 person-month has historically been equal to 5 function points, the job will require 
132 person-months (660/5 = 132). Assuming you have 10 programmers who can 
work on this task, the duration would be approximately 13 months. The cost is eas￾ily derived by multiplying the labor rate per month times 132 person-months. For 
example, if the monthly programmer rate is $8,000, then the estimated cost would be 
$1,056,000 (132 × 8,000). Although function point metrics are useful, their accuracy 
depends on adequate historical data, the currency of the data, and the relevancy of the 
project/deliverable to past averages.
Learning Curves
Some projects require that the same task, group of tasks, or product be repeated sev￾eral times. Managers know intuitively that the time to perform a task improves with 
repetition. This phenomenon is especially true of tasks that are labor intensive. In 
these circumstances, the pattern of improvement phenomenon can be used to predict 
the reduction in time to perform the task. From empirical evidence across all indus￾tries, the pattern of this improvement has been quantified in the learning curve (also 
known as improvement curve, experience curve, and industrial progress curve), which 
is described by the following relationship:
Each time the output quantity doubles, the unit labor hours are reduced at a constant rate.
In practice the improvement ratio may vary from 60 percent, representing very large 
improvement, to 100 percent, representing no improvement at all. Generally, as the 
difficulty of the work decreases the expected improvement also decreases and the 
improvement ratio that is used becomes greater. One significant factor to consider 
is the proportion of labor in the task in relation to machine-paced work. Obviously, a 
lower percentage of improvement can occur only in operations with high labor con￾tent. Appendix 5.1 at the end of the chapter provides a detailed example of how the 
improvement phenomenon can be used to estimate time and cost for repetitive tasks.

The main disadvantage of top-down approaches to estimating is simply that the 
time and cost for a specific task are not considered. Grouping many tasks into a com￾mon basket encourages errors of omission and the use of imposed times and costs.
Micro, bottom-up estimating methods are usually more accurate than macro methods.
Bottom-Up Approaches for Estimating Project Times and Costs
Template Method
If the project is similar to past projects, then template methods can be used as a 
starting point for the new project. Templates are created based on the costs of pre￾vious, similar projects. Differences in the new project can be noted and past times 
and costs adjusted to reflect these differences. For example, a ship repair drydock 
firm has a set of standard repair projects (i.e., templates for overhaul, electrical, 
mechanical) that are used as starting points for estimating the cost and duration of 
any new project. Differences from the appropriate standardized project are noted 
(for times, costs, and resources) and changes are made. This approach enables the 
firm to develop a potential schedule, estimate costs, and develop a budget in a very 
short time span. Development of such templates in a database can quickly reduce 
estimate errors.
Parametric Procedures Applied to Specific Tasks
Just as parametric techniques such as cost per square foot can be the source of top￾down estimates, the same technique can be applied to specific tasks. For example, as 
part of an MS Office conversion project, 36 different computer workstations needed to 
be converted. Based on past conversion projects, the project manager determined that 
on average one person could convert three workstations per day. Therefore, the task 
of converting the 36 workstations would take three technicians four days [(36/3)/3]. 
Similarly, to estimate the wallpapering allowance on a house remodel, contractors fig￾ured a cost of $7 per square yard of wallpaper and $4 per square yard to install it, for a 
total cost of $11. By measuring the length and height of all the walls, they were able to 
calculate the total area in square yards and multiply it by $11.
Range Estimating
When do you use range estimating? Range estimating works best when work pack￾ages have significant uncertainty associated with the time or cost to complete. If the 
work package is routine and carries little uncertainty, using the people most familiar 
with the work package is usually the best approach. They are likely to know best 
how to estimate work packages durations and costs. However, when work packages 
have significant uncertainty associated with the time or cost to complete, it is a pru￾dent policy to require three time estimates—low, average, and high (borrowed from 
PERT methodology that uses probability distributions). The low to high give a range 
within which the average estimate will fall. Determining the low and high estimates 
for the activity is influenced by factors such as complexity, technology, newness, 
and familiarity.
How do you get the estimates? Since range estimating works best for work pack￾ages that have significant uncertainty, having a group determine the low, average, and 
high cost or duration gives best results. Group estimating tends to refine extremes by 
bringing more evaluative judgments to the estimate and potential risks. The judgment 
of others in a group helps to moderate extreme perceived risks associated with a time 
or cost estimate. Involving others in making activity estimates gains buy-in and cred￾ibility to the estimate.

Figure 5.2 presents an abridged estimating template using three time estimates for 
work packages developed by a cross-functional group or groups of project stakehold￾ers. The group estimates show the low, average, and high for each work package. The 
Risk Level column is the group’s independent assessment of the degree of confidence 
that the actual time will be very close to the estimate. In a sense, this number repre￾sents the group’s evaluation of many factors (e.g., complexity, technology) that might 
impact the average time estimate. In our example, the group feels work packages 
104, 108, 110, 111, and 114 have a high chance that the average time may vary from 
expected. Likewise, the group’s confidence feels the risk of work packages 102, 105, 
and 112 not materializing as expected is low. 
How do you use the estimate? Group range estimating gives the project manager 
and owner an opportunity to assess the confidence associated with project times (and/
or costs). For example, a contractor responsible for building a high-rise apartment 
building can tell the owner that the project will cost between $3.5 and $4.1 million 
and take between six and nine months to complete. The approach helps to reduce 
surprises as the project progresses. The range estimating method also provides a basis 
for assessing risk, managing resources, and determining the project contingency fund. 
(See Chapter 7 for a discussion of contingency funds.) Range estimating is popular 
in software and new product projects where up-front requirements are fuzzy and not 
well known. Group range estimating is often used with phase estimating, which is 
discussed next.
A Hybrid: Phase Estimating
This approach begins with a top-down estimate for the project and then refines esti￾mates for phases of the project as it is implemented. Some projects by their nature 
cannot be rigorously defined because of the uncertainty of design or the final product. 
These projects are often found in aerospace projects, IT projects, new technology proj￾ects, and construction projects where design is incomplete. In these projects, phase or 
life-cycle estimating is frequently used.
Phase estimating is used when an unusual amount of uncertainty surrounds a 
project and it is impractical to estimate times and costs for the entire project. Phase

estimating uses a two-estimate system over the life of the project. A detailed estimate 
is developed for the immediate phase and a macro estimate is made for the remaining 
phases of the project. Figure 5.3 depicts the phases of a project and the progression of 
estimates over its life. 
For example, when the project need is determined, a macro estimate of the project 
cost and duration is made so analysis and decisions can be made. Simultaneously a 
detailed estimate is made for deriving project specifications and a macro estimate for 
the remainder of the project. As the project progresses and specifications are solidi￾fied, a detailed estimate for design is made and a macro estimate for the remainder of 
the project is computed. Clearly, as the project progresses through its life cycle and 
more information is available, the reliability of the estimates should be improving. See 
Snapshot from Practice 5.3: Estimate Accuracy.
Phase estimating is preferred by those working on projects where the final product 
is not known and the uncertainty is very large—for example, the development of reus￾able rockets or domestic robots. The commitment to cost and schedule is only neces￾sary over the next phase of the project, and commitment to unrealistic future schedules 
and costs based on poor information is avoided. This progressive macro/micro method 
provides a stronger basis for using schedule and cost estimates to manage progress 
during the next phase.
Unfortunately, your customer—internal or external—will want an accurate esti￾mate of schedule and cost the moment the decision is made to implement the proj￾ect. Additionally, the customer who is paying for the project often perceives phase 
estimating as a blank check because costs and schedules are not firm over most of 
the project life cycle. Even though the reasons for phase estimating are sound and 
legitimate, most customers have to be sold on its legitimacy. A major advantage for 
the customer is the opportunity to change features, re-evaluate the project, or even 
cancel it in each new phase. In conclusion, phase estimating is very useful in projects 
that possess huge uncertainties concerning the final nature (shape, size, features) of 
the project.
See Figure 5.4 for a summary of the differences between top-down and bottom-up 
estimates. 
Obtaining accurate estimates is a challenge. Committed organizations accept the 
challenge of coming up with meaningful estimates and invest heavily in developing 
their capacity to do so. Accurate estimates reduce uncertainty and support a discipline 
for effectively managing projects.

5.5 Level of Detail
Level of detail is different for different levels of management. At any level, the 
detail should be no more than is necessary and sufficient. Top management inter￾ests usually center on the total project and major milestone events that mark major 
The smaller the element of a work 
package, the more accurate the over￾all estimate is likely to be. The extent 
of this improvement varies by type of 
project. The following table is devel￾oped to reflect this observation. For example, infor￾mation technology projects that determine their time 
and cost estimates in the conceptual stage can expect 
their “actuals” to err up to 200 percent over cost and

duration and, perhaps, as much as 30 percent under 
estimates. Conversely, estimates for buildings, roads, 
and so on, made after the work packages are clearly 
defined, have a smaller error in actual costs and times 
of 15 percent over estimate and 5 percent less than 
estimate. Although these estimates vary by project, 
they can serve as ballpark numbers for project stake￾holders selecting how project time and cost estimates 
will be derived.

accomplishments—for example, “build oil platform in the north sea” or “complete 
prototype.” Middle management might center on one segment of the project or one 
milestone. First-line managers’ interests may be limited to one task or work package. 
One of the beauties of WBS is the ability to aggregate network information so each 
level of management can have the kind of information necessary to make decisions.
Getting the level of detail in the WBS to match management needs for effective 
implementation is crucial, but the delicate balance is difficult to find. See Snapshot 
from Practice 5.4: Level of Detail. The level of detail in the WBS varies with the 
complexity of the project; the need for control; the project size, cost, and duration; 
and other factors. If the structure reflects excessive detail, there is a tendency to 
break the work effort into department assignments. This tendency can become a bar￾rier to success, since the emphasis will be on departmental outcomes rather than on 
deliverable outcomes. Excessive detail also means more unproductive paperwork. 
Note that if the level of the WBS is increased by one, the number of cost accounts 
may increase geometrically. On the other hand, if the level of detail is not adequate, 
an organization unit may find the structure falls short of meeting its needs. Fortu￾nately, the WBS has built-in flexibility. Participating organization units may expand 
their portion of the structure to meet their special needs. For example, the Engineer￾ing Department may wish to further break their work on a deliverable into smaller 
packages by electrical, civil, and mechanical. Similarly, the Marketing Depart￾ment may wish to break their new product promotion into TV, radio, periodicals, 
and newspapers.
Practicing project managers advo￾cate keeping the level of detail to a 
minimum. But there are limits to this 
suggestion. One of the most frequent 
errors of new project managers is to 
forget that the task time estimate will be used to con￾trol schedule and cost performance. A frequent rule of 
thumb used by practicing project managers says that a 
task duration should not exceed 5 workdays or at the 
most 10 workdays, if workdays are the time units used 
for the project. Such a rule probably will result in a more 
detailed network, but the additional detail pays off in 
controlling schedule and cost as the project progresses.
Suppose the task is “build prototype computer￾controlled conveyor belt,” the time estimate is 40 
workdays, and the budget $300,000. It may be better 
to divide the task into seven or eight smaller tasks for 
control purposes. If one of the smaller tasks gets behind 
because of problems or a poor time estimate, it will be 
possible to take corrective action quickly and avoid delay￾ing successive tasks and the project. If the single task of 
40 workdays is used, it is possible that no corrective 
action would be taken until day 40, since many people 
have a tendency to “wait and see” or avoid admitting 
they are behind or passing on bad news; the result may 
mean far more than 5 days behind schedule.
The 5- to 10-day rule of thumb applies to cost and 
performance goals. If using the rule of thumb sug￾gested in the previous paragraph results in too many 
network tasks, an alternative is available, but it has 
conditions. The activity time can be extended beyond 
the 5- to 10-day rule only if control monitoring check￾points for segments of the task can be established so 
clear measures of progress can be identified by a spe￾cific percent complete.
This information is invaluable to the control pro￾cess of measuring schedule and cost performance—
for example, payments for contract work are paid on 
“percent complete” basis. Defining a task with clear 
definable start and end points and intermediate points 
enhances the chances of early detection of problems, 
corrective action, and on-time project completion.

5.6 Types of Costs
Assuming work packages are defined, detailed cost estimates can be made. Here are 
typical kinds of costs found in a project:
1. Direct costs
a. Labor
b. Materials
c. Equipment
d. Other
2. Direct project overhead costs
3. General and administrative (G&A) overhead costs
The total project cost estimate is broken down in this fashion to sharpen the control 
process and improve decision making.
Direct Costs
These costs are clearly chargeable to a specific work package. Direct costs can be 
influenced by the project manager, project team, and individuals implementing the 
work package. These costs represent real cash outflows and must be paid as the project 
progresses; therefore, direct costs are usually separated from overhead costs. Lower￾level project rollups frequently include only direct costs.
Direct Project Overhead Costs
Direct overhead rates more closely pinpoint which resources of the organization are 
being used in the project. Direct project overhead costs can be tied to project deliv￾erables or work packages. Examples include the salary of the project manager and 
temporary rental space for the project team. Although overhead is not an immediate 
out-of-pocket expense, it is real and must be covered in the long run if the firm is to 
remain viable. These rates are usually a ratio of the dollar value of the resources used—
for example, direct labor, materials, equipment. For example, a direct labor burden rate 
of 20 percent would add a direct overhead charge of 20 percent to the direct labor cost 
estimate. A direct charge rate of 50 percent for materials would carry an additional 
50 percent charge to the material cost estimate. Selective direct overhead charges pro￾vide a more accurate project (job or work package) cost than does using a blanket 
overhead rate for the whole project.
General and Administrative (G&A) Overhead Costs
These represent organization costs that are not directly linked to a specific project. 
They are carried for the duration of the project. Examples include organization 
costs across all products and projects such as advertising, accounting, and senior 
management above the project level. Allocation of G&A costs varies from orga￾nization to organization. However, G&A costs are usually allocated as a percent 
of total direct cost or a percent of the total of a specific direct cost such as labor, 
materials, or equipment.
Given the totals of direct and overhead costs for individual work packages, it is pos￾sible to cumulate the costs for any deliverable or for the entire project. A percentage 
can be added for profit if you are a contractor. A breakdown of costs for a proposed 
contract bid is presented in Figure 5.5.

Perceptions of costs and budgets vary depending on their users. The project manager 
must be very aware of these differences when setting up the project budget and when 
communicating these differences to others. Figure 5.6 depicts these different perceptions. 
The project manager can commit costs months before the resource is used. This informa￾tion is useful to the financial officer of the organization in forecasting future cash out￾flows. The project manager is interested in when the budgeted cost is expected to occur 
and when the budgeted cost actually is charged (earned); the respective timings of these 
two cost figures are used to measure project schedule and cost variances. 
5.7 Refining Estimates
As described in Chapter 4, detailed work package estimates are aggregated and “rolled 
up” by deliverable to estimate the total direct cost of the project. Similarly, estimated 
durations are entered into the project network to establish the project schedule and 
determine the overall duration of the project. Experience tells us that for many proj￾ects the total estimates do not materialize and the actual costs and schedule of some 
projects significantly exceed original work package–based estimates. In order to com￾pensate for the problem of actual cost and schedule exceeding estimates, some project 
managers adjust total costs by some multiplier (e.g., total estimated costs × 1.20).

The practice of adjusting original estimates by 20 percent or even 100 percent 
begs the question of why, after investing so much time and energy on detailed 
estimates, the numbers could be so far off. There are a number of reasons for this, 
most of which can be traced to the estimating process and the inherent uncertainty of 
predicting the future. Following are some of those reasons.
∙ Interaction costs are hidden in estimates. According to the guidelines, each task 
estimate is supposed to be done independently. However, tasks are rarely com￾pleted in a vacuum. Work on one task is dependent upon prior tasks, and the 
hand-offs between tasks require time and attention. For example, people working 
on prototype development need to interact with design engineers after the design 
is completed, whether to simply ask clarifying questions or to make adjustments 
in the original design. Similarly, the time necessary to coordinate activities is 
typically not reflected in independent estimates. Coordination is reflected in 
meetings and briefings as well as time necessary to resolve disconnects between 
tasks. Time, and therefore cost, devoted to managing interactions rises exponen￾tially as the number of people and different disciplines involved increases on 
a project.
∙ Normal conditions do not apply. Estimates are supposed to be based on normal 
conditions. While this is a good starting point, it rarely holds true in real life, 
especially when it comes to the availability of resources. Resource shortages, 
whether in the form of people, equipment, or materials, can extend original esti￾mates. For example, under normal conditions, four bulldozers are typically used 
to clear a certain site size in five days, but the availability of only three bulldozers 
would extend the task duration to eight days. Similarly, the decision to outsource 
certain tasks can increase costs as well as extend task durations, since time is 
added to acclimating outsiders to the particulars of the project and the culture of 
the organization.
∙ Things go wrong on projects. Design flaws are revealed after the fact, extreme 
weather conditions occur, accidents happen, and so forth. Although you shouldn’t 
plan for these risks to happen when estimating a particular task, the likelihood and 
impact of such events need to be considered.
∙ Project scope and plans change. As one gets further and further into the project, 
a manager obtains a better understanding of what needs to be done to accomplish 
the project. This may lead to major changes in project plans and costs. Likewise, 
if the project is a commercial project, changes often have to be made midstream 
to respond to new demands by the customer and/or competition. Unstable project 
scopes are a major source of cost overruns. While every effort should be made up 
front to nail down the project scope, it is becoming increasingly difficult to do so in 
our rapidly changing world.
∙ People are overly optimistic. There is solid research indicating that people tend to 
overestimate how quickly they can get things done (Buehler, Griffin, & Ross, 1994; 
Lovallo & Kahneman, 2003).
∙ People engage in strategic misrepresentation. There is growing evidence that 
some project promoters underestimate the costs of projects and overestimate project 
benefits in order to win approval. This appears to be particularly true for large-scale 
public works projects, which have a notorious habit of coming in way over budget 
(remember Snapshot from Practice 5.1: Portland Aerial Tram).

lar60886_ch05_140-174.indd 160 09/01/23 06:36 pm
The reality is that for many projects not all of the information needed to make accu￾rate estimates is available, and it is impossible to predict the future. The challenge is 
further compounded by human nature and the political dynamics associated with gain￾ing project approval. The dilemma is that without solid estimates the credibility of the 
project plan is eroded. Deadlines become meaningless, budgets become rubbery, and 
accountability becomes problematic.
Such challenges will influence the final time and cost estimates. Even with the best 
estimating efforts, it may be necessary to revise estimates based on relevant informa￾tion prior to establishing a baseline schedule and budget.
Effective organizations adjust estimates of specific tasks once the risks, resources, 
and particulars of the situation have been more clearly defined. They recognize that 
the rolled-up estimates generated from a detailed estimate based on the WBS are just 
the starting point. As they delve further into the project-planning process, they make 
appropriate revisions in both the time and cost of specific activities. They factor the 
final assignment of resources into the project budget and schedule. For example, when 
they realize that only three instead of four bulldozers are available to clear a site, they 
adjust both the time and cost of that activity. They adjust estimates to account for 
specific actions to mitigate potential risks on the project. For example, to reduce the 
chances of design code errors, they add the cost of independent testers to the schedule 
and budget. Finally, organizations adjust estimates to take into account abnormal con￾ditions. For example, if soil samples reveal excessive ground water, then they adjust 
foundation costs and times.
There will always be some mistakes, omissions, and adjustments that will require 
additional changes in estimates. Fortunately, every project should have a change 
management system in place to accommodate these situations and any impact on 
the project baseline. Change management and contingency funds will be discussed 
in Chapter 7.
5.8 Creating a Database for Estimating
The best way to improve estimates is to collect and archive data on past project esti￾mates and actuals. Saving historical data—estimates and actuals—provides a knowl￾edge base for improving project time and cost estimating. Creating an estimating 
database is a “best practice” among leading project management organizations.
Some organizations, such as Boeing and IBM, have large estimating depart￾ments of professional estimators that have developed large time and cost databases.
Others collect these data through the project office. This database approach allows 
the project estimator to select a specific work package item from the database for 
inclusion. The estimator then makes any necessary adjustments concerning the 
materials, labor, and equipment. Of course, any items not found in the database can 
be added to the project—and ultimately to the database if desired. Again, the qual￾ity of the database estimates depends upon the experience of the estimators, but 
over time the data quality should improve. Such structured databases serve as feed￾back for estimators and as benchmarks for cost and time for each project. In addi￾tion, comparison of estimate and actual for different projects can suggest the degree 
of risk inherent in estimates. See Figure 5.7 for the structure of a database similar 
to those found in practice.

5.9 Mega Projects: A Special Case
Mega projects are large-scale, complex ventures that typically cost $1 billion or more, 
take many years to complete, and involve multiple private and public stakeholders. 
They are often transformational, and impact millions of people (Flyvbjerg, 2014). 
Examples include high-speed rail lines, airports, healthcare reform, the Olympics, 
development of new aircraft, and so forth. What do these projects have in common 
beyond scope and complexity? They all tend to go way over budget and fall behind 
schedule. For example, the new Denver airport that opened in 1995 had cost overruns 
of 200 percent and was completed two years later than planned. The “Chunnel,” the 
31-mile-plus tunnel that connects France with England, was 80 percent over budget. 
These are but two examples of many public works and other large-scale projects in 
which costs came in way over than planned. In a study of government infrastructure 
projects, Flyvbjerg found costs for bridges and tunnels, roads, and rails to be underes￾timated 34 percent, 20 percent, and 45 percent, respectively, from baseline estimates 
(Flyvbjerg, Bruzelius, & Rothengatter, 2003)!
Mega projects often involve a double whammy. Not only did they cost much 
more than expected, but they underdelivered on benefits they were to provide. The 
Denver airport realized only 55 percent of forecasted traffic during its first year of 
operation. The Chunnel traffic revenues have been one-half of what was predicted 
with internal rate of return of −14.5 percent! Again Flyvbjerg’s study revealed a 
consistent pattern of underusage on most infrastructure projects (Flyvbjerg et al., 
2003), including only a 5 percent forecasted usage for the Kolkata (Calcutta) metro 
in India!

So why does there appear to be a consistent pattern of overestimating benefits and 
underestimating costs? Many argue the sheer complexity and long time horizon make 
it impossible to accurately estimate costs and benefits. While this is certainly true, 
Flyvbjerg and his colleagues’ research suggests that other factors come into play. They 
concluded that in most cases project promoters use deception to promote projects 
not for public good but for personal gain, political or economic. Deception may be 
deliberate, or may be the product of overzealousness, optimism, and ignorance (Fly￾vbjerg et al., 2003). In some cases, promoters rationalize that nothing great would ever 
get built if people knew in advance what the real costs and challenges involved were 
(Hirschman, 1967).
On some mega projects, there is a triple whammy. Not only are they over budget 
and under value, but the cost of maintaining them exceeds the benefits received. These 
kinds of projects are called white elephants.
A “white elephant” suggests a valuable, but burdensome, possession, which its 
owner cannot easily dispose of and whose cost (particularly upkeep) is out of propor￾tion with its usefulness. The term derives from the story that the Kings of Siam (now 
Thailand) would often make a present of a white elephant to courtiers who had fallen 
out of favor with the king. At first glance, it was a great honor to receive such a revered 
beast from the king. However, the true intent was to ruin the recipient by forcing him 
to absorb the costs of taking care of the animal.
Examples of white elephants abound. While traveling across southern China one 
of the authors was struck by the palatial stature of the Trade Expo buildings each city 
had. It was as if each city had tried to outdo its neighbor in terms of grandeur. When 
asked how often they were used, city officials would say once or twice a year. The 
2015 FIFA scandal brought attention to the hidden costs of hosting the World Cup. 
South Africa built six new world-class stadiums for the 2010 competition. None of the 
post–World Cup revenue generated from these stadiums exceeds their maintenance 
cost (Molloy & Chetty, 2015).
White elephants are not limited to buildings and stadiums. Air France had to moth￾ball the Concorde, the world’s fastest commercial airline, because maintenance costs 
and noise restrictions did not justify a three-flights-a-week schedule. It is not uncom￾mon in our personal lives to acquire white elephants, such as underutilized vacation 
homes or yachts.
Flyvbjerg and others argue that cost overrun is not the price of doing big things and 
that we are capable of making better informed decisions on mega projects. The first 
step is to assume there is optimism bias and even deception on the part of promoters. 
Proposals should require a thorough review by impartial observers who do not have 
vested interest in the project. Some if not all financial risk should be absorbed by 
promoters and those who benefit financially from the project. Sustainable business 
practices should be used and maintenance costs be integrated into the forecasted cost/
benefit analyses of projects. See Snapshot from Practice 5.5: Avoiding the Curse of 
the White Elephant to see how British organizers tried to avoid the curse of the white 
elephant in the 2012 Olympic games.

Once, hosting the Olympics was con￾sidered the crown prize and a tremen￾dous source of national pride. Seven 
cities competed to host the 1992 
Winter Olympics. For the 2022 Winter 
Olympics only Beijing and Almaty (Kazakhstan) submit￾ted bids. Oslo (Norway), the favorite, withdrew applica￾tion due to a lack of public support. Likewise, Boston 
withdrew application for the 2024 Summer Olympics in 
the face of public outcry.
Why the outcry? Because of the legacy of exorbi￾tant cost overruns and draining maintenance costs. 
The Olympics has a long history of expensive white 
elephants. For example, the Beijing National Stadium, 
nicknamed the Bird’s Nest, built at a cost of $480 mil￾lion for the 2008 Olympic games, requires over $10 
million each year to maintain and has no regular tenant.
Some have attributed the Greek economic melt￾down to exorbitant debt accrued from hosting the 
2004 summer games (Flyvbjerg, 2014). “It felt good at 
the time because we were the center of the world, and 
we got to show off our country,” says gymnast Chris￾tos Libanovnos of the Hellenic Gymnastics Federation. 
“But what did it cost? So much money—billions of 
euros. And now we are bankrupt, and everything just 
gets worse and worse every day. It’s hard not to see a 
connection. It’s hard not to think that maybe it wasn’t 
worth it.”1
Perhaps the most infamous example of an Olym￾pic white elephant is the 1976 Montreal Olympic Sta￾dium. Originally nicknamed the Big O, due to its unique 
doughnut design, the stadium soon became known 
across Canada as the Big Owe. Estimated to cost $134 
million, it took Canadian taxpayers 30 years to pay off 
the final $1.1 billion debt. To make matters worse, the 
stadium was not completely finished by the time the 
Olympics opened. The stadium has not had a main ten￾ant since 2004, when the successful Montreal Expos 
moved to Washington, D.C.
The London 2012 Olympics organizers were com￾mitted to reducing the Olympic financial hangover. In 
particular, they were well aware of hidden post-Olympic

maintenance costs of buildings that were no longer in 
demand. One advantage they had over less developed 
countries is that the infrastructure and many of the are￾nas were already in place and the Olympics provided 
a necessary upgrade. They built temporary arenas 
for less popular sports. For example, after the games 
the water polo arena was deconstructed and materi￾als recycled. The 12,000-seat basketball arena was 
designed to be portable so it could be used in future 
Olympics. Scalability was another key consideration. 
For example, during the Olympics over 17,000 people 
watched swimming events in the newly constructed 
aquatic center. The aquatic center was downsized to 
a 2,500-person capacity after the Olympics and is now 
open to the public.
In recognition of its achievements, London 2012 
Olympics won Gold in the Environmental and Sustain￾ability category of the 6th International Sports Events 
awards. “We set out with a huge promise to the world, 
to deliver the most sustainable Olympic Games of mod￾ern times,” says David Stubbs, London 2012’s Head of 
Sustainability. “Seven years, nine million visitors, and 
2,484 medals later, that’s exactly what we achieved.”

In particular, Flyvbjerg advocates an external view based on the outcome of similar 
projects completed in the past. It is called reference class forecasting (RCF) and 
involves three major steps:
1. Select a reference class of projects similar to your potential project, for example, 
cargo ships or bridges.
2. Collect and arrange outcome data as a distribution. Create a distribution of cost 
overruns as a percentage of the original project estimate (low to high).
3. Use the distribution data to arrive at a realistic forecast. Compare the original cost 
estimate for the project with the reference class projects. Take, for example, a three￾mile-long rail tunnel project. Tunnel advocates estimate that it will cost $100 million. 
Analyses of similar tunnel projects in the region indicate that on average they are 
34 percent over budget. If the proponents cannot come up with a reasonable expla￾nation for why this project will be different, decision makers should assume that the 
tunnel will cost at least $134 million.
The benefits of RCF are compelling:
∙ Outside empirical data mitigates human bias.
∙ Political, strategic, and promoter forces have difficulty ignoring outside RCF 
information.
∙ RCF serves as a reality check for funding large projects.
∙ RCF helps executives avoid unsound optimism.
∙ RCF leads to improved accountability.
∙ RCF provides a basis for project contingency funds.
The use of RCF is increasing as governments and organizations require this method to 
be used to temper project promoters’ estimates and reduce cost/benefit inaccuracies.
Summary Quality time and cost estimates are the bedrock of project control. Past experience is 
the best starting point for these estimates. The quality of estimates is influenced by 
other factors such as people, technology, and downtimes. Companies that excel record 
past experiences and create an estimation database that provides quick and accurate 
information on the cost of specific work packages.
Using top-down estimates is good for initial and strategic decision making or in situa￾tions where the costs associated with developing better estimates have little benefit. How￾ever, in most cases, the bottom-up approach to estimating is preferred and more reliable 
because it assesses each work package, rather than the whole project, section, or deliver￾able of a project. Estimating time and costs for each work package facilitates development 
of the project schedule and a time-phased budget, which are needed to control the project 
as it is implemented. Using the estimating guidelines will help eliminate many common 
mistakes made by those unacquainted with estimating times and costs for project control.
The level of time and cost detail should follow the old phrase “no more than is 
necessary and sufficient.” Managers must remember to differentiate among commit￾ted outlays, actual costs, and scheduled costs. It is well known that up-front efforts in 
clearly defining project objectives, scope, and specifications vastly improve time and 
cost estimate accuracy.
Culture plays a significant role in estimating. If the focus is on what went wrong 
instead of who is to blame, then people should be more forthright in sharing their 
experiences and insights. However, if you work in a punitive organizational culture

that is only concerned with results, you are likely to be much more guarded in what 
you share and may even pad estimates out of self-protection.
Finally, large-scale mega projects like subway systems or football stadiums often suf￾fer from underestimated costs and overestimated benefits. They also can evolve into white 
elephants whose cost of maintenance exceeds benefits. Steps must be taken to remove bias 
and compare mega project estimates with similar projects that have been done in the past.

3. The Munsters have been saving money in order to buy a house. They figure that, 
given current interest rates, they could afford a $500,000 home. Before looking at 
houses on the market they decide to explore the possibility of building a new 
home. The Munsters figure they could buy a suitable lot for $90,000–$95,000. At 
a minimum, they want to build a 2,200-square-foot house. The cost for a house of 
the quality they desire is $200 per square foot. Given this information, should the 
Munsters pursue the option of building a new house?

and house similar to this one has been $250 per square foot. Fortunately, Xander 
is a retired plumber and feels he can save money by installing the plumbing him￾self. Mrs. Publinsky feels she can take care of the interior decorating. They both 
feel they can complete the exterior painting with the help of their two sons.

Case 5.1
Sharp Printing, AG
Three years ago the Sharp Printing (SP) strategic management group set a goal of 
having a color laser printer available for the consumer and small business market for 
less than $200. A few months later the senior management met off-site to discuss the 
new product. The results of this meeting were a set of general technical specifications 
along with major deliverables, a product launch date, and a cost estimate based on 
prior experience.
Shortly afterward a meeting was arranged for middle management explaining the 
project goals, major responsibilities, project start date, and importance of meeting the 
product launch date within the cost estimate. Members of all departments involved 
attended the meeting. Excitement was high. Although everyone saw the risks as high, 
the promised rewards for the company and the personnel were emblazoned in their 
minds. A few participants questioned the legitimacy of the project duration and cost 
estimates. A couple of R&D people were worried about the technology required to 
produce the high-quality product for less than $200. But given the excitement of the 
moment, everyone agreed the project was worth doing and doable. The color laser 
printer project was to have the highest project priority in the company.
Lauren was selected to be the project manager. She had 15 years of experience 
in printer design and manufacture, which included successful management of several 
projects related to printers for commercial markets. Since she was one of those uncom￾fortable with the project cost and time estimates, she felt getting good bottom-up time 
and cost estimates for the deliverables was her first concern. She quickly had a meeting 
with the significant stakeholders to create a WBS identifying the work packages and 
organization unit responsible for implementing the work packages. Lauren stressed 
that she wanted time and cost estimates from those who would do the work or were 
the most knowledgeable, if possible. Getting estimates from more than one source was 
encouraged. Estimates were due in two weeks.
The compiled estimates were placed in the WBS/OBS. The corresponding cost esti￾mate seemed to be in error. The cost estimate was $1,250,000 over the top-down senior 
management estimate; this represented about a 20 percent overrun! Furthermore, the 
Final PDF to printer170 Chapter 5 Estimating Project Times and Costs
lar60886_ch05_140-174.indd 170 09/01/23 06:36 pm
bottom-up time estimate based on the project network was four months longer than the 
top management time estimate. Another meeting was scheduled with the significant 
stakeholders to check the estimates and to brainstorm for alternative solutions. At this 
meeting, everyone agreed the bottom-up cost and time estimates appeared to be accu￾rate. Following are some of the suggestions from the brainstorming session.
∙ Change scope.
∙ Outsource technology design.
∙ Use the priority matrix (found in Chapter 4) to get top management to clarify their 
priorities.
∙ Partner with another organization or build a research consortium to share costs and 
to share the newly developed technology and production methods.
∙ Cancel the project.
∙ Commission a break-even study for the laser printer.
Very little in the way of concrete savings was identified, although there was consen￾sus that time could be compressed to the market launch date, but at additional costs.
Lauren met with the marketing (Connor), production (Kim), and design (Gage) 
managers, who yielded some ideas for cutting costs, but nothing significant enough to 
have a large impact. Gage remarked, “I wouldn’t want to be the one to deliver the mes￾sage to top management that their cost estimate is $1,250,000 off! Good luck, Lauren.”

Post-Graduation Adventure
Josh and Mike met as roommates during freshman year at Macalester College in St. 
Paul, Minnesota. Despite a rocky start they became best friends. They are planning a 
two-week adventure together to celebrate their graduation in June. Josh has never been 
to Europe and wants to visit France or Spain. Mike spent a semester abroad in Aarhus, 
Denmark, and traveled extensively in northern Europe. Even though Mike has never 
been to France or Spain, he wants to go to someplace more exotic, like South Africa or 
Vietnam. For the past week, they have been arguing over where they should go. Josh 
argues that it will cost too much to fly to South Africa or Vietnam, while Mike coun￾ters that it will be much cheaper to travel in Vietnam or South Africa once they are 
there. They agree that they can spend no more than $4,000 each on the trip and could 
be gone for only two weeks.
One evening when they were arguing with each other over beers with friends, Sara 
said, “Why don’t you use what you learned in your project management class to decide 
what to do?” Josh and Mike looked at each other and agreed that made perfect sense.

A5-1 Use learning curves to improve task estimates.
Learning Curves for Estimating
A forecast estimate of the time required to perform a work package or task is a basic neces￾sity for scheduling the project. In some cases, the manager simply uses judgment and past 
experience to estimate work package time or uses historical records of similar tasks.
Most managers and workers intuitively know that improvement in the amount of 
time required to perform a task or group of tasks occurs with repetition. Workers can 
perform tasks better/quicker the second time and each succeeding time they perform 
them (without any technological change). It is this pattern of improvement that is 
important to the project manager and project scheduler.
This improvement from repetition generally results in a reduction of labor hours for 
the accomplishment of tasks and results in lower project costs. From empirical evi￾dence across all industries, the pattern of this improvement has been quantified in the 
learning curve (also known as improvement curve, experience curve, and industrial 
progress curve), which is described by the following relationship: 
Each time the output quantity doubles, the unit labor hours are reduced at a constant rate.
For example, assume that a manufacturer has a new contract for 16 prototype units 
and a total of 800 labor hours were required for the first unit. Past experience has 
indicated that on similar types of units the improvement rate has been 80 percent. This 
relationship of improvement in labor hours is shown below:
Unit Labor Hours
 1 800
 2 800 × 0.80 = 640
 4 640 × 0.80 = 512
 8 512 × 0.80 = 410
16 410 × 0.80 = 328
By using Table A5.1 unit values, similar labor hours per unit can be determined. Looking 
across the 16 unit level and down the 80 percent column, we find a ratio of 0.4096. By 
multiplying this ratio times, the labor hours for the first unit, we obtain the per unit value:
0.4096 × 800 = 327.68 or 328 hours
That is, the 16th unit should require close to 328 labor hours, assuming an 80 percent 
improvement ratio.
Obviously, a project manager may need more than a single unit value for estimating 
the time for some work packages. The cumulative values in Table A5.2 provide factors 
for computing the cumulative total labor hours of all units. In the previous example, 
for the first 16 units, the total labor hours required would be
800 × 8.920 = 7,136 hours

By dividing the total cumulative hours (7,136) by the units, the average unit labor 
hours can be obtained:
7,136 labor hours/16 units = 446 average labor hours per unit
Note how the labor hours for the 16th unit (328) differs from the average for all 
16 units (446). The project manager, knowing the average labor costs and processing 
costs, could estimate the total prototype costs. (The mathematical derivation of factors 
found in Tables A5.1 and A5.2 can be found in Jelen, F. C., and J. H. Black, Cost and 
Optimization Engineering, 2nd ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1983).
FOLLOW-ON CONTRACT EXAMPLE
Assume the project manager gets a follow-on order of 74 units; how should s/he estimate 
labor hours and cost? Going to the cumulative Table A5.2, we find at the 80 percent ratio 
and 90 total units intersection—a 30.35 ratio.
Design elements: Snapshot from Practice, Highlight box, Case icon: Sky Designs/Shutterstock
800 × 30.35 = 24,280 labor hours for 90 units
Less previous 16 units =  7,136
Total follow-on order = 17,144 labor hours
17,144/74 equals 232 average labor hours per unit
Labor hours for the 90th unit can be obtained from Table A5.1: 0.2349 × 800 = 187.9 
labor hours. (For ratios between given values, simply estimate.)
Exercise A5.1
Norwegian Satellite Development Company (NSDC) 
Cost Estimates 
for
World Satellite Telephone Exchange Project
NSDC has a contract to produce eight satellites to support a worldwide telephone 
system (for Alaska Telecom, Inc.) that allows individuals to use a single, portable tele￾phone in any location on earth to call in and out. NSDC will develop and produce the 
eight units. NSDC has estimated that the R&D costs will be NOK (Norwegian Krone) 
12,000,000. Material costs are expected to be NOK 6,000,000. They have estimated 
that the design and production of the first satellite will require 100,000 labor hours, 
and an 80 percent improvement curve is expected. Skilled labor cost is NOK 300 per 
hour. Desired profit for all projects is 25 percent of total costs.
A. How many labor hours should the eighth satellite require?
B. How many labor hours for the whole project of eight satellites?
C. What price would you ask for the project? Why?
D. Midway through the project your design and production people realize that a 75 percent 
improvement curve is more appropriate. What impact does this have on the project?
E. Near the end of the project, Deutsch Telefon AG requests a cost estimate for four 
satellites identical to those you have already produced. What price will you quote 
them? Justify your price.

6.1 Developing the Project Network
The project network is the tool used for planning, scheduling, and monitoring proj￾ect progress. The network is developed from the information collected for the WBS 
and is a graphic flow chart of the project job plan. The network depicts the project 
activities that must be completed, the logical sequences, the interdependencies of 
the activities to be completed, and in most cases the times for the activities to 
start and finish along with the longest path(s) through the network—the critical 
path. The network is the framework for the project information system that will be 
used by the project managers to make decisions concerning project time, cost, and 
performance.
Developing the project networks takes time for someone or some group to develop; 
therefore, they cost money! Are networks really worth the struggle? The answer is 
definitely yes, except in cases where the project is considered trivial or very short in 
duration.1
 The network is easily understood by others because the network presents a 
graphic display of the flow and sequence of work through the project. Once the net￾work is developed, it is very easy to modify when unexpected events occur as the 
project progresses. For example, if materials for an activity are delayed, the impact can 
be quickly assessed and the whole project revised in only a few minutes with the 
computer. These revisions can be communicated to all project participants quickly 
(e.g., via e-mail or project website).

The project network provides other invaluable information and insights. It provides 
the basis for scheduling labor and equipment. It enhances communication that melds 
all managers and groups together in meeting the time, cost, and performance objec￾tives of the project. It provides an estimate of project duration rather than picking a 
random project completion date or someone’s preferred date. The network gives the 
times when activities can start and finish and when they can be delayed. It provides the 
basis for budgeting the cash flow of the project. It identifies which activities are “criti￾cal” and, therefore, should not be delayed if the project is to be completed as planned. 
It highlights which activities to consider if the project needs to be compressed to meet 
a deadline.
There are other reasons project networks are worth their weight in gold. Basically, 
project networks minimize surprises by getting the plan out early and allowing correc￾tive feedback. A commonly heard statement from practitioners is that the project net￾work represents three-quarters of the planning process. Perhaps this is an exaggeration, 
but it signals the perceived importance of the network to project managers in the field.
6.2 From Work Package to Network
Project networks are developed from the WBS. The project network is a visual flow 
diagram of the sequence, interrelationships, and dependencies of all the activities 
that must be accomplished to complete the project. An activity is an element in the 
project that consumes time—for example, work or waiting. Work packages from the 
WBS are used to build the activities found in the project network. An activity can 
include one or more work packages. The activities are placed in a sequence that pro￾vides for orderly completion of the project. Networks are built using nodes (boxes) 
and arrows (lines).
Integrating the work packages and the network represents a point where the man￾agement process often fails in practice. The primary explanations for this failure are 
that (1) different groups (people) are used to define work packages and activities and 
(2) the WBS is poorly constructed and not deliverable/output oriented. Integration of 
the WBS and project network is crucial to effective project management. The project 
manager must be careful to guarantee continuity by having some of the same people 
who defined the WBS and work packages develop the network activities.
Networks provide the project schedule by identifying dependencies, sequencing, and 
timing of activities, which the WBS is not designed to do. The primary inputs for devel￾oping a project network plan are work packages. Remember, a work package is defined 
independently of other work packages, has definite start and finish points, requires spe￾cific resources, includes technical specifications, and has cost estimates for the package. 
However, dependency, sequencing, and timing of each of these factors are not included in 
the work package. A network activity can include one or more work packages.
Figure 6.1 shows a segment of the WBS example and how the information is 
used to develop a project network. The lowest-level deliverable in Figure 6.1 is 
“circuit board.” The cost accounts (design, production, test, software) denote project 
work, organization unit responsible, and time-phased budgets for the work pack￾ages. Each cost account represents one or more work packages. For example, the 
design cost account has two work packages (D-1-1 and D-1-2)—specifications and 
documentation. The software and production accounts also have two work packages. 
Developing a network requires sequencing tasks from all work packages that have 
measurable work. 
Understand the linkage 
between WBS and the 
project network.

Figure 6.1 traces how work packages are used to develop a project network. You 
can trace the use of work packages by the coding scheme. For example, activity A uses 
work packages D-1-1 and D-1-2 (specifications and documentation), while activity C 
uses work package S-22-1. This methodology of selecting work packages to describe 
activities is used to develop the project network, which sequences and times project 
activities. Care must be taken to include all work packages. The manager derives activ￾ity time estimates from the task times in the work package. For example, activity B 
(proto 1) requires five weeks to complete; activity K (test) requires three weeks to 
complete. After computing the activity early times and late times, the manager can 
schedule resources and time-phase budgets (with dates).

6.3 Constructing a Project Network
Terminology
Every field has its jargon that allows colleagues to communicate comfortably with 
each other about the techniques they use. Project managers are no exception. Here are 
some terms used in building project networks:
Activity. For project managers, an activity is an element of the project that 
requires time. It may or may not require resources. Typically an activity consumes 
time—either while people work or while people wait. Examples of the latter are 
time waiting for contracts to be signed, materials to arrive, drug approval by the 
government, and budget clearance. Activities usually represent one or more tasks 
from a work package. Descriptions of activities should use a verb/noun format—
for example, develop product specifications.
Parallel activities. These are activities that can take place at the same time, if the 
manager wishes. However, the manager may choose to have parallel activities not
occur simultaneously.
Burst activity. This activity has more than one activity immediately following it 
(more than one dependency arrow flowing from it).
Merge activity. This is an activity that has more than one activity immediately 
preceding it (more than one dependency arrow flowing to it).
Path. This is a sequence of connected, dependent activities.
Critical path. When this term is used, it means the path(s) with the longest 
duration through the network; if an activity on the path is delayed, the project is 
delayed the same amount of time.
Basic Rules to Follow in Developing Project Networks
The following eight rules apply in general when developing a project network:
1. Networks flow typically from left to right.
2. An activity cannot begin until all preceding connected activities have been 
completed.
3. Arrows on networks indicate precedence and flow. Arrows can cross over each 
other.
4. Each activity should have a unique identification number.
5. An activity identification number must be larger than that of any activities that pre￾cede it.
6. Looping is not allowed (in other words, recycling through a set of activities cannot 
take place).
7. Conditional statements are not allowed (i.e., this type of statement should not 
appear: if successful, do something; if not, do nothing).
8. Experience suggests that when there are multiple starts, a common start node can 
be used to indicate a clear project beginning on the network. Similarly, a single 
project end node can be used to indicate a clear ending.

are used to create project networks.

6.4 Activity-on-Node (AON) Fundamentals
Historically, two methods have been used to develop project networks: activity￾on-node (AON) and activity-on-arrow (AOA). Over time the availability of 
advanced computer graphics improved the clarity and visual appeal of the AON 
method. Today the activity-on-node method has come to dominate nearly all proj￾ect network plans. For this reason, we have limited our discussion to AON meth￾ods. Figure 6.2 shows a few typical uses of building blocks for the AON network 
construction. An activity is represented by a node (box). The node can take many 
forms, but in recent years the node represented as a rectangle (box) has dominated. 
The dependencies among activities are depicted by arrows between the rectangles 
(boxes) on the AON network. The arrows indicate how the activities are related and 
the sequence in which things must be accomplished. The length and slope of the 
arrow are arbitrary and set for the convenience of drawing the network. The letters 
in the boxes serve here to identify the activities while you learn the fundamentals 
of network construction and analysis. In practice, activities have identification 
numbers and descriptions. 
In practice, small project networks 
(25–100 activities) are frequently devel￾oped using yellow Post-it®
 stickers.
The following are the require￾ments for such a project:
1. Project team members and a facilitator.
2. One yellow sticker (3 × 4 inches or larger) for each 
activity with the description of the activity printed 
on the sticker.
3. Erasable whiteboard with marker pen (a long, 
4-foot-wide piece of butcher paper can be used in 
place of the whiteboard).
All of the yellow stickers are placed in easy view of all 
team members. The team begins by identifying those 
activity stickers that have no predecessors. Each of 
these activity stickers is then attached to the white￾board. A start node is drawn, and a dependency arrow 
is connected to each activity.
Given the initial network start activities, each activ￾ity is examined for immediate successor activities. 
These activities are attached to the whiteboard and 
dependency arrows drawn. This process is continued 
until all of the yellow stickers are attached to the white￾board with dependency arrows. (Note: The process can 
be reversed, beginning with those activities that have 
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 6.1 The Yellow Sticky Approach (for 
Constructing a Project Network)
no successor activities and connecting them to a proj￾ect end node. The predecessor activities are selected 
for each activity and attached to the whiteboard with 
dependency arrows marked.)
When the process is complete, the dependencies 
are recorded in the project software, which develops 
a project network along with the critical path(s) and 
early, late, and slack times. This methodology sensi￾tizes team members early to the interdependencies 
among activities of the project. But more importantly, 
the methodology empowers team members by giv￾ing them input into the important decisions they must 
implement later.

There are three basic relationships that must be established for activities included 
in a project network. The relationships can be found by answering the following three 
questions for each activity.
1. Which activities must be completed immediately before this activity? These activi￾ties are called predecessor activities.
2. Which activities must immediately follow this activity? These activities are called 
successor activities.
3. Which activities can occur while this activity is taking place? This is known as a 
concurrent or parallel relationship.
Sometimes a manager can use only questions 1 and 3 to establish relationships. 
This information allows the network analyst to construct a graphic flow chart of the 
sequence and logical interdependencies of project activities.
Figure 6.2A is analogous to a list of things to do where you complete the task at the 
top of the list first and then move to the second task, etc. This figure tells the project 
manager that activity A must be completed before activity B can begin and that activ￾ity B must be completed before activity C can begin.

Figure 6.2B tells the project manager that activities Y and Z cannot begin until activ￾ity X is completed. This figure also indicates that activities Y and Z can occur concur￾rently or simultaneously if the project manager wishes; however, it is not a necessary 
condition. For example, pouring a concrete driveway (activity Y) can take place while 
landscape planting (activity Z) is being accomplished, but land clearing (activity X) 
must be completed before activities Y and Z can start. Activities Y and Z are consid￾ered parallel activities. Parallel paths allow concurrent effort, which may shorten the 
time to do a series of activities. Activity X is sometimes referred to as a burst activity 
because more than one arrow bursts from the node. The number of arrows indicates 
how many activities immediately follow activity X.
Figure 6.2C shows the project manager that activities J, K, and L can occur simul￾taneously if desired and that activity M cannot begin until activities J, K, and L are all 
completed. Activities J, K, and L are parallel activities. Activity M is called a merge
activity because more than one activity must be completed before activity M can 
begin. Activity M could also be called a milestone—a significant accomplishment.
In Figure 6.2D, activities X and Y are parallel activities that can take place at the 
same time; activities Z and AA are also parallel activities. But activities Z and AA 
cannot begin until activities X and Y are both completed. Given these fundamentals of 
AON, we can practice developing a simple network. Remember, the arrows can cross 
over each other (e.g., Figure 6.2D), be bent, or be any length or slope. Neatness is not 
a criterion for a valid, useful network—only accurate inclusion of all project activities, 
their dependencies, and their time estimates.
Information for a simplified project network is given in Table 6.1. This project rep￾resents a new automated warehouse system for picking frozen food package orders and 
moving them to a staging area for delivery to stores.
Figure 6.3 shows the first steps in constructing the AON project network from the 
information in Table 6.1. We see that activity A (Define Requirements) has nothing 
preceding it; therefore, it is the first node to be drawn. Next, we note that activities B 
(Assign Team) and C (Design Hardware) are both preceded by activity A. We draw 
two arrows and connect them to activities B and C. This segment shows the project 
manager that activity A must be completed before activities B and C can begin. After 
A is completed, B and C can take place concurrently, if desired. Figure 6.4 shows the 
completed network with all of the activities’ sequences and dependencies. 
The information in Figure 6.4 is tremendously valuable to those managing the proj￾ect. However, estimating the duration for each activity will further increase the value 
of the network. A realistic project plan and schedule require reliable time estimates for 
project activities. The addition of time to the network allows us to estimate how long

the project will take. When activities can or must start, when resources must be avail￾able, which activities can be delayed, and when the project is estimated to be complete 
are all determined from the times assigned. Deriving an activity time estimate neces￾sitates early assessment of resource needs in terms of material, equipment, and people. 
In essence, the project network with activity time estimates links the planning, sched￾uling, and controlling of projects.
6.5 Network Computation Process
Drawing the project network places the activities in the right sequence for computing 
the start and finish times of activities. Activity time estimates are taken from the task 
times in the work package and added to the network (review Figure 6.1). Performing 
a few simple computations allows the project manager to complete a process known 
as the forward and backward pass. Completion of the forward and backward pass will 
answer the following questions.

Forward Pass—Earliest Times
1. How soon can the activity start (early start—ES)?
2. How soon can the activity finish (early finish—EF)?
3. How soon can the project be finished (expected time—TE)?
Backward Pass—Latest Times
1. How late can the activity start (late start—LS)?
2. How late can the activity finish (late finish—LF)?
3. Which activities represent the critical path (CP)? This is the longest path in the 
network, which, when delayed, will delay the project.
4. How long can the activity be delayed (slack or float—SL)?
The terms in parentheses represent the acronyms used in most texts and computer pro￾grams and by project managers. The forward and backward pass process is presented next.
Forward Pass—Earliest Times
The forward pass starts with the first project activity(ies) and traces each path (chain 
of sequential activities) through the network to the last project activity(ies). As you 
trace along the path, you add the activity times. The longest path denotes the project 
completion time for the plan and is called the critical path (CP). Table 6.2 lists the 
activity times in workdays for the Automated Warehouse project example we used for 
drawing a network.
Figure 6.5 shows the network with the activity time estimate found in the node (see 
“DUR” for duration in the legend). For example, activity A (Define Requirements) 
has an activity duration of 10 workdays, and activity E (Build & Test Hardware) has 
a duration of 50 days. The forward pass begins with the project start time, which is 
usually time zero. (Note: Calendar times can be computed for the project later in the 
planning phase.) 
In our Automated Warehouse example, the early start time for the first activity (activ￾ity A) is zero. This time is found in the upper left corner of the activity A node in 
Figure 6.6. The early finish for activity A is 10 days (EF = ES + DUR, or 0 + 10 = 10). 
Next, we see that activity A is the predecessor for activities B (Assign Team) and C 
(Design Hardware). Therefore, the earliest activities B and C can begin is the instant in 
time when activity A is completed; this time is 10 days. You can now see in Figure 6.6

that activities B and C have an early start (ES) of 10 days. Using the formula EF = 
ES + DUR, the early finish (EF) times for activities B and C are 15 and 35 days. 
Following the same process of moving along each network path, the early start and 
finish times for selected activities are shown here: 
Activity D: ES = 15 EF = 15 + 20 = 35 Activity F: ES = 35 EF = 35 + 15 = 50
Activity E: ES = 35 EF = 35 + 50 = 85 Activity G: ES = 35 EF = 35 + 35 = 70
Activity H (Integrate Systems) is a merge activity because it is preceded by more 
than one activity. The early start (ES) of a merge activity depends on the early finish 
(EF) of all activities that merge to it. In this project, activity H is preceded by activi￾ties E, F, and G. Which activity controls the ES of activity H? The answer is activity E. 
In Figure 6.6, the EF times are 85, 50, and 70. Since 85 days is the largest EF time, 
activity E controls the ES for activity H, which is 85. If activity E is delayed, activ￾ity H will be delayed. The early finish for activity H or the project is 100 days (EF = 
ES + DUR, or 85 + 15 = 100).
The forward pass requires that you remember just three things when computing 
early activity times:
1. You add activity times along each path in the network (ES + DUR = EF).
2. You carry the early finish (EF) to the next activity where it becomes its early start 
(ES), or
3. If the next succeeding activity is a merge activity, you select the largest early finish 
number (EF) of all its immediate predecessor activities.
The three questions derived from the forward pass have been answered; that is, early 
start (ES), early finish (EF), and the project expected duration (TE) times have been 
computed. The backward pass is the next process to learn.
Backward Pass—Latest Times
The backward pass starts with the last project activity(ies) on the network. You trace 
backward on each path, subtracting activity times to find the late start (LS) and late 
finish (LF) times for each activity. Before the backward pass can be computed, the late 
finish for the last project activity(ies) must be selected. In early planning stages, this 
time is usually set equal to the early finish (EF) of the last project activity (or in the 
case of multiple finish activities, the activity with the largest EF). In some cases, an 
imposed project duration deadline exists, and this date will be used. Let us assume for 
planning purposes we can accept the EF project duration (TE) equal to 100 workdays. 
The LF for activity H becomes 100 days (EF = LF) (see Figure 6.7). 
The backward pass is similar to the forward pass; you need to remember three 
things:
1. You subtract activity times along each path starting with the project end activity 
(LF − DUR = LS).
2. You carry the LS to the preceding activity to establish its LF, or
3. If the next preceding activity is a burst activity; in this case you select the smallest
LS of all its immediate successor activities to establish its LF.
Let us apply these rules to our Automated Warehouse example. Beginning with 
activity H (Integrate Systems) and an LF of 100 workdays, the LS for activity H is 
85 days (LF − DUR = LS, or 100 − 15 = 85). The LS for activity H becomes the LF

for activities E, F, and G. Moving backward on the network, the late starts for E, F, and 
G are shown here (LS = LF − DUR):
Activity E: LS = 85 − 50 = 35 Activity G: 85 − 35 = 50
Activity F: LS = 85 − 15 = 70
At this point, we see that activity C is a burst activity that ties to (precedes) activities 
E and F. The late finish for activity C is controlled by the LS of activities E and F. 
The smallest LS of activities E and F (LS’s = 35 and 70) is activity E. This establishes 
the LF for activity C. The LS for activity C becomes 10. Moving backward to the 
first project activity, we note it is also a burst activity that links to activities B and C. 
The LF of activity A is controlled by activity C, which has the smallest LS of 10 days. 
Given an LF of 10 days, the LS for activity is time period zero (LS = 10 − 10 = 0). 
The backward pass is complete, and the latest activity times are known. Figure 6.8 shows 
the completed network with all the early, late, and slack times included. Slack can be 
important to managing your project. 
Determining Slack (or Float)
Total Slack
When the forward pass and backward pass have been computed, it is possible to deter￾mine which activities can be delayed by computing “slack,” or “float.” Total slack
tells us the amount of time an activity can be delayed and not delay the project. Stated

differently, total slack is the amount of time an activity can exceed its early finish date 
without affecting the project end date or an imposed completion date.
Total slack, or float, for an activity is simply the difference between the LS and ES 
(LS − ES = SL) or between the LF and EF (LF − EF = SL). For example, in Figure 6.8, 
the total slack for activity D is 15 workdays, for activity F is 35 days, and for activity 
E is zero. If total slack of one activity in a path is used, the ES for all activities that 
follow in the chain will be delayed and their slack reduced. Use of total slack must be 
coordinated with all participants in the activities that follow in the chain.
After slack for each activity is computed, the critical path(s) is (are) easily identi￾fied. When the LF = EF for the end project activity, the critical path can be identified as 
those activities that also have LF = EF or a slack of zero (LF − EF = 0 or LS − ES = 0). 
The critical path is the network path(s) that has (have) the least slack in common.
This awkward arrangement of words is necessary because a problem arises when the 
project finish activity has an LF that differs from the EF found in the forward pass—
for example, an imposed duration date. If this is the case, the slack on the critical path 
will not be zero; it will be the difference between the project EF and the imposed LF 
of the last project activity. For example, if the EF for the project is 100 days, but the 
imposed LF or target date is set at 95 days, all activities on the critical path have a 
slack of minus 5 days. Of course, this would result in a late start 5 days for the first 
project activity—a good trick if the project is to start now. Negative slack occurs in 
practice when the critical path is delayed.
In Figure 6.8, the critical path is marked with dashed arrows—activities A, C, 
E, and H. Delay of any of these activities will delay the total project by the same

number of days. Since actual projects may have many critical activities with numer￾ous preceding dependencies, coordination among those responsible for critical 
activities is crucial. Critical activities typically represent about 10 percent of the 
activities of the project. Therefore, project managers pay close attention to the criti￾cal path activities to be sure they are not delayed. See Snapshot from Practice 6.2: 
The Critical Path.
We use the term sensitivity to reflect the likelihood the original critical path(s) will 
change once the project is initiated. Sensitivity is a function of the number of critical 
or near-critical paths. A network schedule that has only one critical path and noncriti￾cal activities that enjoy significant slack would be labeled insensitive. Conversely, a 
sensitive network would be one with more than one critical path and/or noncritical 
activities with very little slack. Under these circumstances, the original critical path is 
much more likely to change once work gets under way on the project. How sensitive is 
the Automated Warehouse schedule? Not very, since there is only one critical path and 
the two other noncritical paths have 15 and 35 days of slack, which suggests consider￾able flexibility. Project managers assess the sensitivity of their network schedules to 
determine how much attention they should devote to managing the critical path.
Free Slack (Float)
Free slack (FS) is unique. It is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without 
delaying any immediately following (successor) activity.2
 Free slack can never be negative. 
2
 An alternative way of defining FS is the amount of time an activity can exceed its early finish date without affecting the 
early start date of any successor(s).
The critical path method (CPM) has 
long been considered the “Holy 
Grail” of project management. Here 
are comments made by veteran proj￾ect managers when asked about the 
significance of the critical path in managing projects:
• I try to make it a point whenever possible to put 
my best people on critical activities or on those 
activities that stand the greatest chance of 
becoming critical.
• I pay extra attention when doing risk assessment 
to identifying those risks that can impact the criti￾cal path, either directly or indirectly, by making a 
noncritical activity so late that it becomes critical. 
When I’ve got money to spend to reduce risks, it 
usually gets spent on critical tasks.
• I don’t have time to monitor all the activities on a 
big project, but I make it a point to keep in touch 
with the people who are working on critical activi￾ties. When I have the time, they are the ones I 
visit to find out firsthand how things are going. It’s 
amazing how much more I can find out from talk￾ing to the rank and file who are doing the work 
and by reading the facial expressions of people—
much more than I can gain from a number-driven 
status report.
• When I get calls from other managers asking to 
“borrow” people or equipment, I’m much more 
generous when it involves resources from work￾ing on noncritical activities. For example, if another 
project manager needs an electrical engineer who 
is assigned to a task with five days of slack, I’m 
willing to share that engineer with another project 
manager for two to three days.
• The most obvious reason the critical path is impor￾tant is because these are the activities that impact 
completion time. If I suddenly get a call from above 
saying they need my project done two weeks ear￾lier than planned, the critical path is where I sched￾ule the overtime and add extra resources to get 
the project done more quickly. In the same way, if 
the project schedule begins to slip, it’s the critical 
activities I focus on to get back on schedule.

from total slack.

Only activities that occur at the end of a chain of activities, where you have a merge activ￾ity, can have free slack. See Figure 6.8, the Automated Warehouse project.
In Figure 6.8, activity G has free slack of 15 days, while activities B and D do not. 
In this case, activity G is the last activity in the upper path, and it merges to activity H. 
Hence, to delay activity G up to 15 days does not delay any following activities and 
requires no coordination with managers of other activities. Conversely, if either activ￾ity B or activity D is delayed, the managers of following activities need to be notified 
that the slack has been used so they can adjust their start schedules. For example, if 
activity B is delayed 5 days, the manager of activity B should notify those in charge of 
the following activities (D and G) that their slack has been reduced to 10 time units and 
their early start will be delayed 5 days. In this example, activity D cannot then start until 
day 20, which reduces activity D slack to 10 days (LS − ES = SL or 30 − 20 = 10). 
Free slack for activity G is also reduced to 10 days.
Free slack occurs at the last activity in a chain of activities. In some situations, the 
“chain” has only one link. Activity F in Figure 6.8 is an example. It has free slack of 
35 days. Note that it needs no coordination with other activities—unless a delay 
exceeds the free slack of 35 days. (Note: The moment you exceed all free slack avail￾able, you delay the project and must coordinate with others who are impacted.)
The distinction between free and total slack at first glance seems trivial, but in 
reality it is very important. When you are responsible for a late activity that has zero 
free slack, you impact the schedules of subsequent activities. You should notify the 
managers of the remaining activities in the chain that you will be late. Again, note that 
total slack is shared across the whole path. Alternatively, if you are responsible for an 
activity that has free slack when you start, you do not need to notify anyone as long as 
your work does not absorb all of the slack!
6.6 Using the Forward and Backward Pass Information
Returning to the Automated Warehouse project network in Figure 6.8, what does a 
slack of 35 days for activity F (Develop Patient Request) mean for the project man￾ager? In this specific case, it means activity F can be delayed 35 days. In a larger sense, 
the project manager soon learns that free slack is important because it allows flexibil￾ity in scheduling scarce project resources—personnel and equipment—that are used 
on more than one parallel activity or another project.
Knowing the four activity times of ES, LS, EF, and LF is invaluable for the plan￾ning, scheduling, and controlling phases of the project. The ES and LF tell the project 
manager the time interval in which the activity should be completed. For example, 
activity G (Test Software) must be completed within the time interval 35 and 85 days; 
the activity can start as early as day 35 or finish as late as day 85. Conversely, activity C 
(Design Hardware) must start on day 10, or the project will be delayed.
When the critical path is known, it is possible to tightly manage the resources of 
the activities on the critical path so no mistakes are made that will result in delays. In 
addition, if for some reason the project must be expedited to meet an earlier date, it is 
possible to select those activities, or a combination of activities, that will cost the least 
to shorten the project. Similarly, if the critical path is delayed and the time must be 
made up by shortening some activity or activities on the critical path to make up any 
negative slack, it is possible to identify the activities on the critical path that cost the 
least to shorten. If there are other paths with very little slack, it may be necessary to 
shorten activities on those paths also.

6.7 Level of Detail for Activities
Time-phasing work and budgets of the project mandate careful definition of the activi￾ties that make up the project network. Typically, an activity represents one or more 
tasks from a work package. How many tasks you include in each activity sets the level 
of detail. In some cases, it is possible to end up with too much information to manage, 
and this can result in increased overhead costs. Managers of small projects have been 
able to minimize the level of detail by eliminating some of the preliminary steps to 
drawing networks. Larger firms also recognize the cost of information overload and 
are working to cut down the level of detail in networks.
6.8 Practical Considerations
Network Logic Errors
Project network techniques have certain logic rules that must be followed. One rule 
is that conditional statements such as “if test successful build proto, if failure rede￾sign” are not permitted. The network is not a decision tree; it is a project plan that 
we assume will materialize. If conditional statements were allowed, the forward and 
backward pass would make little sense. Although in reality a plan seldom material￾izes as we expect in every detail, it is a reasonable initial assumption. You will see 
that once a network plan is developed, it is an easy step to make revisions to accom￾modate changes.
Another rule that defeats the project network and computation process is looping.
Looping is an attempt by the planner to return to an earlier activity. Recall that the 
activity identification numbers should always be higher for the activities following 
an activity in question; this rule helps to avoid the illogical precedence relationships 
among the activities. An activity should only occur once; if it is to occur again, the 
activity should have a new name and identification number and should be placed in 
the right sequence on the network. Figure 6.9 shows an illogical loop. If this loop were 
allowed to exist, this path would perpetually repeat itself. Many computer programs 
catch this type of logic error.
Activity Numbering
Each activity needs a unique identification code—a letter or a number. In practice, 
very elegant schemes exist. Most schemes number activities in ascending order—that 
is, each succeeding activity has a larger number so that the flow of the project activi￾ties is toward project completion. It is customary to leave gaps between numbers (1, 5, 
10, 15, . . .). Gaps are desirable so you can add missing or new activities later. Because 
it is nearly impossible to draw a project network perfectly, numbering networks is fre￾quently not done until after the network is complete.
In practice, you will find computer programs that accept numeric, alphabetic, or a 
combination of activity designations. Combination designations are often used to identify

cost, work skill, department, and location. As a general rule, activity numbering systems 
should be ascending and as simple as possible. The intent is to make it as easy as you can 
for project participants to follow work through the network and locate specific activities.
Use of Computers to Develop Networks
All of the tools and techniques discussed in this chapter can be used with the computer 
software currently available. Two examples are shown in Figure 6.10 and Figure 6.11. 
Figure 6.10 presents a generic AON computer output for the Automated Warehouse Order 
Picking System project. Observe that these computer outputs use numbers to identify 
activities. The critical path is identified by the nodes (activities) 2, 4, 6, and 9. The activity 
description is shown on the top line of the activity node. The activity start time (ES) and 
identification are on the second line. The finish time (EF) and duration are on the third 
line of the node. The project starts on January 1 and is planned to finish May 20. Note this 
sample computer network has included non-workdays of holidays and weekends. 
Figure 6.11 presents an early-start Gantt chart.3
 Bar charts are popular because 
they present an easy-to-understand, clear picture on a time-scaled horizon. They are 
used during planning, resource scheduling, and status reporting. The format is a two￾dimensional representation of the project schedule, with activities down the rows and 
time across the horizontal axis. In this computer output, the shaded bars represent the 
activity durations. The extended lines from the bars represent slack. For example, 
“Test Software” (ID # 8) has a duration of 35 days (shaded area of the bar) and 15 days 
of slack (represented by the extended line). The bar also indicates that Test Software 
has an early start of February 19 and would finish April 8 but can finish as late as 
April 29 because it has 15 days of slack. When calendar dates are used on the time 
axis, Gantt charts provide a clear overview of the project schedule and can often be 
found posted on the walls of project offices. Unfortunately, when projects have many 
dependency relationships, the dependency lines soon become overwhelming and 
defeat the simplicity of the Gantt chart.
Project management software can be a tremendous help in the hands of those who 
understand and are familiar with the tools and techniques discussed in this text. How￾ever, there is nothing more dangerous than someone using the software with little or 
no knowledge of how the software derives its output. Mistakes in input are very com￾mon, and someone skilled in the concepts, tools, and information system is needed to 
recognize that errors exist so that false actions are avoided.
Calendar Dates
Ultimately you will want to assign calendar dates to your project activities. If a computer 
program is not used, dates are assigned manually. Lay out a calendar of workdays (exclude 
non-workdays) and number them. Then relate the calendar workdays to the workdays on 
your project network. Most computer programs will assign calendar dates automatically 
after you identify start dates, time units, non-workdays, and other information.
Multiple Starts and Multiple Projects
Some computer programs require a common start and finish event in the form of 
a node—usually a circle or rectangle—for a project network. Even if this is not a 
requirement, it is a good idea because it avoids “dangler” paths. Dangler paths give the 
impression that the project does not have a clear beginning or ending. If a project has 
more than one activity that can begin when the project is to start, each path is a dangler

path. The same is true if a project network ends with more than one activity; these 
unconnected paths are also called danglers. Danglers can be avoided by tying dangler 
activities to a common project start or finish node.
When several projects are tied together in an organization, using a common start 
and end node helps to identify the total planning period of all projects. Use of pseudo 
or dummy wait activities from the common start node allows different start dates for 
each project.
6.9 Extended Network Techniques to Come Closer to Reality
The method for showing relationships among activities in the previous sections is 
called the finish-to-start relationship because it assumes all immediately preceding 
connected activities must be completed before the next activity can begin. In an effort 
to come closer to the realities of projects, some useful extensions have been added. 
The use of laddering was the first obvious extension practitioners found very useful.
Laddering
The assumption that all immediately preceding activities must be 100 percent complete 
is too restrictive for some situations found in practice. This restriction occurs most fre￾quently when one activity overlaps the start of another and has a long duration. Under the 
standard finish-to-start relationship, when an activity has a long duration and will delay 
the start of an activity immediately following it, the activity can be broken into segments 
and the network drawn using a laddering approach so the following activity can begin 
sooner and not delay the work. This segmenting of the larger activity gives the appearance 
of steps on a ladder on the network, thus the name. The classic example used in many 
texts and articles is laying pipe, because it is easy to visualize. The trench must be dug, 
pipe laid, and the trench refilled. If the pipeline is one mile long, it is not necessary to dig 
one mile of trench before the laying of pipe can begin or to lay one mile of pipe before 
refill can begin. Figure 6.12 shows how these overlapping activities might appear in an 
AON network using the standard finish-to-start approach. 
Use of Lags to Reduce Schedule Detail and Project Duration
The use of lags has been developed to offer greater flexibility in network construction. 
A lag is the minimum amount of time a dependent activity must be delayed to begin or 
end. The use of lags in project networks occurs primarily for two reasons:
1. When activities of long duration delay the start or finish of successor activities, the net￾work designer normally breaks the activity into smaller activities to avoid the long delay 
of the successor activity. Use of lags can avoid such delays and reduce network detail.
2. Lags can be used to constrain the start and finish of an activity.

The most commonly used relationship extensions are start-to-start, finish-to-finish, 
and combinations of these two. These relationship patterns are discussed in this 
section.
Finish-to-Start Relationship
The finish-to-start relationship represents the typical, generic network style (used in 
the early part of the chapter). However, there are situations in which the next activ￾ity in a sequence must be delayed even when the preceding activity is complete. For 
example, removing concrete forms cannot begin until the poured cement has cured for 
two time units. Figure 6.13 shows this lag relationship for AON networks. Finish￾to-start lags are frequently used when ordering materials. For example, it may take 
1 day to place orders but take 19 days to receive the goods. The use of finish-to-start 
allows the activity duration to be only 1 day and the lag 19 days. This approach ensures 
the activity cost is tied to placing the order only, rather than charging the activity for 
20 days of work. This same finish-to-start lag relationship is useful to depict transpor￾tation, legal, and mail lags.
The use of finish-to-start lags should be carefully checked to ensure their validity. 
Conservative project managers and those responsible for completion of activities have 
been known to use lags as a means of building in a “slush” factor to reduce the risk of 
being late. A simple rule to follow is that the use of finish-to-start lags must be justi￾fied and approved by someone responsible for a large section of the project. The legiti￾macy of lags is not usually difficult to discern. The legitimate use of the additional 
relationship shown can greatly enhance the network by more closely representing the 
realities of the project.
Start-to-Start Relationship
An alternative to segmenting the activities, as we did earlier, is to use a start-to-start 
relationship. Typical start-to-start relationships are shown in Figure 6.14. Figure 6.14A

shows the start-to-start relationship with zero lag in which on a movie set you would 
want filming and recording audio to start simultaneously. Figure 6.14B shows the 
same relationship with a lag of five time units. It is important to note that the relation￾ship may be used with or without a lag. If time is assigned, it is usually shown on the 
dependency arrow of an AON network. 
In Figure 6.14B, testing cannot begin until five time units after coding begins. This 
type of relationship typically depicts a situation in which you can perform a portion of 
one activity and begin a following activity before completing the first. This relation￾ship can be used on the pipe-laying project. Figure 6.15 shows the project using an 
AON network. The start-to-start relationship reduces network detail and project delays 
by using lag relationships. 
It is possible to find compression opportunities by changing finish-to-start rela￾tionships to start-to-start relationships. A review of finish-to-start critical activities 
may point out opportunities that can be revised to be parallel by using start-to-start 
relationships. For example, in place of a finish-to-start activity “design house, then 
build foundation,” a start-to-start relationship could be used in which the foundation 
can be started, say, five days (lag) after design has started—assuming the design of 
the foundation is the first part of the total design activity. This start-to-start rela￾tionship with a small lag allows a sequential activity to be worked on in parallel and 
to compress the duration of the critical path. This same concept is frequently found 
in projects in which concurrent engineering is used to speed completion of a proj￾ect. Concurrent engineering, which is highlighted in Snapshot from Practice 6.3: 
Concurrent Engineering, basically breaks activities into smaller segments so that 
work can be done in parallel and the project expedited (Turtle, 1994). Start-to-start 
relationships can depict the concurrent engineering conditions and reduce network 
detail. Of course, the same result can be accomplished by applying the “laddering” 
technique and breaking an activity into small packages that can be implemented in 
parallel. However, laddering significantly increases the network and tracking detail 
when used repeatedly.
Next we discuss two other lags which are much rarer in practice.

In the old days, when a new product 
development project was initiated 
by a firm, it would start its sequential 
journey in the Research and Devel￾opment Department. Concepts and 
ideas would be worked out and the results passed 
to the Engineering Department, which sometimes 
reworked the whole product. This result would be 
passed to Manufacturing, where it might be reworked 
once more in order to ensure the product could be 
manufactured using existing machinery and opera￾tions. Quality improvements were initiated after the 
fact once defects and improvement opportunities 
were discovered during production. This sequential 
approach to product development required a great 
deal of time, and it was not uncommon for the final 
product to be totally unrecognizable when compared 
to original specifications.
Given the emphasis on speed to the market, com￾panies have abandoned the sequential approach to 
product development and have adopted a more holistic 
approach, called concurrent engineering. In a nutshell, 
concurrent engineering entails the active involve￾ment of all the relevant specialty areas throughout

(Fast Tracking)*

Times, June 25, 2009. Accessed 6/2/11.
the design and development process. The traditional, 
chainlike sequence of finish-to-start relationships is 
replaced by a series of start-to-start lag relationships 
as soon as meaningful work can be initiated for the 
next phase. Figure 6.16 summarizes the dramatic gains 
in time to market achieved by this approach. 
Within the world of project management, this 
approach is also called fast tracking. General Motors 
used this approach to design the very first American 
hybrid car, the Chevy Volt. From the very beginning,
specialists from Marketing, Engineering, Design, 
Manufacturing, Quality Assurance, and other relevant 
departments were involved in every stage of the proj￾ect. Not only did the project meet all of its objectives, 
but it was completed ahead of schedule.
Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. government effort 
to bring effective COVID-19 vaccines to the public, relied 
heavily on fast tracking. Instead of waiting for vaccines 
to be approved, manufacturing and distribution systems 
were being created while drugs were in development. 
The hope was, once a vaccine was approved, all systems 
would be go for release to the public.

Finish-to-Finish Relationship
This relationship is shown in Figure 6.17. The finish of one activity depends on the 
finish of another activity. For example, testing cannot be completed any earlier than 
four days after the prototype is complete. Note that this is not a finish-to-start relation￾ship because the testing of subcomponents can begin before the prototype is com￾pleted, but four days of “system” testing is required after the prototype is finished.
Start-to-Finish Relationship
This relationship represents situations in which the finish of an activity depends on 
the start of another activity. For example, system documentation cannot end until three 
days after testing has started (see Figure 6.18). All the relevant information to com￾plete the system documentation is produced after the first three days of testing.
Combinations of Lag Relationships
More than one lag relationship can be attached to an activity. These relationships are 
usually start-to-start and finish-to-finish combinations tied to two activities. For exam￾ple, debug cannot begin until two time units after coding has started. Coding must be 
finished four days before debug can be finished (see Figure 6.19). 
An Example Using Lag Relationships—the Forward and Backward Pass
The forward and backward pass procedures are the same as explained earlier in the 
chapter for finish-to-start relationships (without lags). The modifying technique lies 
in the need to check each new relationship to see if it alters the start or finish time of 
another activity.
An example of the outcome of the forward and backward pass is shown in Figure 6.20. 
Order hardware depends upon the design of the system (start-to-start). Three days into the 
design of the system (activity A), it is possible to order the required hardware (activity B). 
It takes four days after the order is placed (activity B) for the hardware to arrive so it can 
begin to be installed (activity C). After two days of installing the software system (activ￾ity D), the testing of the system can begin (activity E). System testing (activity E) can be 
completed one day after the software is installed (activity D). Preparing system docu￾mentation (activity F) can begin once the design is completed (activity A), but it cannot 
be completed until two days after testing the system (activity E) is completed. This final 
relationship is an example of a finish-to-finish lag. 
Note how an activity can have a critical finish and/or start. Activities E and F have 
critical finishes (zero slack), but their activity starts have 3 and 11 days of slack. It is

only the finishes of activities E and F that are critical. Conversely, activity A has zero 
slack to start but has five days of slack to finish. So, for example, the project team real￾izes that they have some flexibility in scheduling a portion of the testing work (activ￾ity E) up until the installation of software (activity D), at which time they know to be 
ready to complete the testing within one day after the installation.
The critical path follows activity start and finish constraints that occur due to the 
use of the additional relationships available and the imposed lags. You can identify the 
critical path in Figure 6.20 by following the dashed line on the network.
If a lag relationship exists, each activity must be checked to see if the start or finish 
is constrained. For example, in the forward pass, the EF of activity E (test system) (17) 
is controlled by the finish of activity D (install software) and the lag of one time unit 
(16 + lag 1 = 17). Finally, in the backward pass, the LS of activity A (design system) is 
controlled by activity B (order hardware) and the lag relationship to activity A (3 − 3 = 0).
Hammock Activities
Another of the extended techniques uses a hammock activity. This type of activity 
derives its name because it spans over a segment of a project. The hammock activ￾ity duration is determined after the network plan is drawn. Hammock activities are 
frequently used to identify the use of fixed resources or costs over a segment of the 
project. Typical examples of hammock activities are inspection services, consultants, 
and construction management services.
A hammock activity derives its duration from the time span between other activi￾ties. For example, a special color copy machine is needed for a segment of a tradeshow

publication project. A hammock activity can be used to indicate the need for this 
resource and to apply costs over this segment of the project. This hammock is linked 
from the start of the first activity in the segment that uses the color copy machine to 
the end of the last activity that uses it. The hammock duration is simply the difference 
between the EF for the last activity and the ES of the first activity. The duration is 
computed after the forward pass and hence has no influence on other activity times. 
Figure 6.21 provides an example of a hammock activity used in a network. The dura￾tion for the hammock activity is derived from the early start of activity B and the early 
finish of activity F—that is, the difference between 13 and 5, or 8 time units. The ham￾mock duration will change if any ES or EF in the chain-sequence changes. Hammock 
activities are very useful in assigning and controlling indirect project costs.4
Another major use of hammock activities is to aggregate sections of a project. 
This is similar to developing a subnetwork, but the precedence is still preserved. This 
approach is sometimes used to present a “macro network” for upper management lev￾els. Using a hammock activity to group activities can facilitate getting the right level 
of detail for specific sections of a project.
4 In order to designate G as a hammock activity in MS Project 2021, you would copy and paste for activity G the start date 
of activity B and the finish date for activity F.

Summary Many project managers feel the project network is their most valuable exercise and 
planning document. Project networks sequence and time-phase the project work, 
resources, and budgets. Work package tasks are used to develop activities for networks.
Every project manager should feel comfortable working in an AON environment. 
The AON method uses nodes (boxes) for activities and arrows for dependencies. The 
forward and backward pass establishes early and late times for activities as well as slack. 
Final PDF to printer202 Chapter 6 Developing a Project Schedule
lar60886_ch06_175-218.indd 202 08/23/23 11:24 am
The critical path is the longest activity path(s) through the network. Any delay in an 
activity on the critical path will delay the project completion, assuming everything 
else goes according to plan. On time-sensitive projects, project managers monitor the 
critical path closely, often assigning their best personnel to those activities.
Several extensions and modifications have been appended to the original AON 
method. Lags allow the project planner to more closely replicate the conditions found in 
practice. The use of lags can result in the start or finish of an activity becoming critical. 
Some computer software simply calls the whole activity critical rather than identify￾ing the start or finish as being critical. Caution should be taken to ensure that lags are 
not used as a buffer for possible errors in estimating time. Finally, hammock activities 
are useful in tracking the costs of resources used for a particular segment of a project. 
Hammock activities can also be used to reduce the size of a project network by grouping 
activities for simplification and clarity. All of the discussed refinements to the original 
AON methodology contribute toward better planning and control of projects.

Note: Do not include summary tasks in the network (i.e., 1.3, Ceremony, is a sum￾mary task; 1.2, Marriage license, is not a summary task). Do not consider who would 
be doing the task in building the network. For example, do not arrange “hiring a 
band” to occur after “florist” because the same person is responsible for doing both 
tasks. Focus only on technical dependencies between tasks.
Hint: Start with the last activity (wedding reception), and work your way back to the 
start of the project. Build the logical sequence of tasks by asking the following ques￾tion: in order to have or do this, what must be accomplished immediately before this? 
Once completed, check forward in time by asking this question: is this task the only 
thing that is needed immediately before the start of the next task?

venture. The area is accessible by car, bus, train, and air. The board of directors has voted 
to build the 10-million-dollar complex recommended in the study. Unfortunately, due to 
the short summer season, the complex will have to be built in stages. The first stage 
(year 1) will contain a day lodge, chair lift, rope tow, generator house (for electricity), and 
parking lot designed to accommodate 400 cars and 30 buses. The second and third stages 
will include a hotel, an ice rink, a pool, shops, two additional chair lifts, and other attrac￾tions. The board has decided that stage one should begin no later than April 1 and be 
completed by October 1, in time for the next skiing season. You have been assigned the 
task of project manager, and it is your job to coordinate the ordering of materials and 
construction activities to ensure the project’s completion by the required date.
After looking into the possible sources of materials, you are confronted with the follow￾ing time estimates. Materials for the chair lift and rope tow will take 30 days and 12 days, 
respectively, to arrive once the order is submitted. Lumber for the day lodge, generator hut, 
and foundations will take 9 days to arrive. The electrical and plumbing materials for the day 
lodge will take 12 days to arrive. The generator will take 12 days to arrive. Before actual 
construction can begin on the various facilities, a road to the site must be built; this will take 
6 days. As soon as the road is in, clearing can begin concurrently on the sites of the day 
lodge, generator house, chair lift, and rope tow. It is estimated that the clearing task at each 
site will take 6 days, 3 days, 36 days, and 6 days, respectively. The clearing of the main ski 
slopes can begin after the area for the chair lift has been cleared; this will take 84 days.
The foundation for the day lodge will take 12 days to complete. Construction of the 
main framework will take an additional 18 days. After the framework is completed, 
electrical wiring and plumbing can be installed concurrently. These should take 24 and 
30 days, respectively. Finally, the finishing construction on the day lodge can begin; 
this will take 36 days.
Installation of the chair lift towers (67 days) can begin once the site is cleared, lumber 
delivered, and foundation completed (6 days). Also, when the chair lift site has been cleared, 
construction of a permanent road to the upper towers can be started; this will take 24 days. 
While the towers are being installed, the electric motor to drive the chair lift can be installed; 
the motor can be installed in 24 days. Once the towers are completed and the motor 
installed, it will take 3 days to install the cable and an additional 12 days to install the chairs.
Installation of the towers for the rope tow can begin once the site is cleared and the 
foundation is built and poured; it takes 4 days to build the foundation, pour the concrete, 
and let it cure and 20 days to install the towers for the rope tow. While the towers are being 
erected, installation of the electric motor to drive the rope tow can begin; this activity will 
take 24 days. After the towers and motor are installed, the rope tow can be strung in 1 day. 
The parking lot can be cleared once the rope tow is finished; this task will take 18 days.
The foundation for the generator house can begin at the same time as the foundation 
for the lodge; this will take 6 days. The main framework for the generator house can 
begin once the foundation is completed; framing will take 12 days. After the house is 
framed, the diesel generator can be installed in 18 days. Finishing construction on the 
generator house can now begin and will take 12 more days.

Part B. Upon further review, the team recognize that they missed three finish-to-start 
lags. Procure prototype parts will involve only 2 days of work but it will take 8 days for 
the parts to be delivered. Likewise, Order stock components will take 2 days of work 
and 8 days for delivery and Order custom components will take 2 days of work and 
13 days for delivery.
Reconfigure the CyClon schedule by entering the three finish-to-start lags. What 
impact did these lags have on the original schedule? On the amount of work required 
to complete the project?
Part C. Management is still not happy with the schedule and wants the project com￾pleted as soon as possible. Unfortunately, they are not willing to approve additional 
resources. One team member pointed out that the network contained only finish-to￾start relationships and that it might be possible to reduce project duration by creating 
start-to-start lags. After much deliberation, the team concluded that the following rela￾tionships could be converted into start-to-start lags:
∙ Procure prototype parts could start 6 days after the start of Design.
∙ Fabricate parts could start 9 days after the start of Design.
∙ Laboratory test could begin 1 day after the start of Assemble prototype.
∙ Field test could start 5 days after the start of Laboratory test.
∙ Adjust design could begin 7 days after the start of Field test.
∙ Order stock and Order custom components could begin 5 days after Adjust design.
∙ Test unit could begin 9 days after the start of Assemble test production unit.
∙ Document results could start 3 days after the start of Test unit.
Reconfigure the CyClon schedule by entering all nine start-to-start lags. What impact 
did these lags have on the original schedule (Part A)? How long will the project take? 
Is there a change in the critical path? Is there a change in the sensitivity of the net￾work? Why would management like this solution?

 Case 6.1
Advantage Energy Technology Data 
Center Migration*—Part A
Brian Smith, network administrator at Advanced Energy Technology (AET), has been 
given the responsibility of implementing the migration of a large data center to a new 
office location. Careful planning is needed because AET operates in the highly compet￾itive petroleum industry. AET is one of five national software companies that provide 
an accounting and business management package for oil jobbers and gasoline distribu￾tors. A few years ago AET jumped into the “application service provider” world. Their 
large data center provides clients with remote access to AET’s complete suite of appli￾cation software systems. Traditionally, one of AET’s primary competitive advantages 
has been the company’s trademark IT reliability. Due to the complexity of this project, 
Brian will have to use a parallel method of implementation. Although this will increase 
project costs, a parallel approach is essential if reliability is not to be compromised.
Currently, AET’s data center is located on the second floor of a renovated old bank 
building in downtown Corvallis, Oregon. The company is moving to a new, one-level 
building in the recently developed industrial complex at the Corvallis International 
Airport. On February 1, Brian is formally assigned the task by the vice president of 
operations, Sasha Whitmore, with the following guidelines:
∙ From start to finish, it is anticipated the entire project will take three to four months 
to complete.
∙ It is essential that AET’s 235 clients suffer no downtime.
Whitmore advises Brian to come back to the Executive Committee on February 15 
with a presentation on the scope of the project that includes costs, “first-cut” timeline, 
and proposed project team members.
Brian had some preliminary discussions with some of AET’s managers and directors 
from each of the functional departments and then arranged for a full-day scope meeting 
on February 4 with a few of the managers and technical representatives from Operations, 
Systems, Facilities, and Applications. The scope team determined the following:
∙ Three to four months is a feasible project timeline, and first-cut cost estimate is 
$80,000–$90,000 (this includes the infrastructure upgrade of the new site).
∙ Critical to the “no-downtime” requirement is the need to completely rely on AET’s 
remote disaster recovery “hot” site for full functionality.
∙ Brian will serve as project manager of a team consisting of one team member each 
from Facilities, Operations/Systems, Operations/Telecommunications, Systems 
and Applications, and Customer Service.
Brian’s Executive Committee report was positively received and, after a few modi￾fications and recommendations, he was formally charged with responsibility for the 
project. Brian recruited his team and scheduled their first team meeting (March 1) as 
the initial task of his project-planning process.
Once the initial meeting is conducted Brian can hire the contractors to renovate the 
new data center. During this time Brian will figure out how to design the network. Brian

estimates that screening and hiring a contractor will take about one week and that the 
network design will take about two weeks. The new center requires a new ventilation 
system. The manufacturer’s requirements include an ambient temperature of 67 degrees 
to keep all of the data servers running at optimal speeds. The ventilation system has a 
lead time of three weeks. Brian will also need to order new racks to hold the servers, 
switches, and other network devices. The racks have a two-week delivery time.
The data center supervisor requested that Brian replace all of the old power supplies 
and data cables. Brian will need to order these as well. Because Brian has a great rela￾tionship with the vendor, they guarantee that it will take only one week lead time for the 
power supplies and the data cables. Once the new ventilation system and racks arrive, 
Brian can begin installing them. It will take one week to install the ventilation system 
and three weeks to install the racks. The renovation of the new data center can begin 
as soon as the contractors have been hired. The contractors tell Brian that construction 
will take 20 days. Once the construction begins and after Brian installs the ventilation 
system and racks, the city inspector must approve the construction of the raised floor.
The city inspector will take two days to approve the infrastructure. After the city inspec￾tion and after the new power supplies and cables have arrived, Brian can install the power 
supplies and run the cables. Brian estimates that it will take five days to install the power 
supplies and one week to run all of the data cables. Before Brian can assign an actual date 
for taking the network offline and switching to the hot remote site, he must get approval 
from each of the functional units (“switchover approval”). Meetings with each of the func￾tional units will require one week. During this time he can initiate a power check to ensure 
that each of the racks has sufficient voltage. This will require only one day.
Upon completion of the power check, he can take one week to install his test serv￾ers. The test servers will test all of the primary network functions and act as a safe￾guard before the network is taken offline. The batteries must be charged, ventilation 
installed, and test servers up and running before management can be assured that the 
new infrastructure is safe, which will take two days. Then they will sign off the pri￾mary systems check, taking one day of intense meetings. They will also set an official 
date for the network move.
Brian is happy that everything has gone well thus far and is convinced that the move 
will go just as smoothly. Now that an official date is set, the network will be shut down 
for a day. Brian must move all of the network components to the new data center. Brian 
will do the move over the weekend—two days—when user traffic is at a low point.
ASSIGNMENT
1. Generate a priority matrix for AET’s system move.
2. Develop a WBS for Brian’s project. Include duration (days) and predecessors.
3. Using a project-planning tool, generate a network diagram for this project.
Note: Base your plan on the following guidelines: eight-hour days, five-day weeks 
except for when Brian moves the network components over a weekend, no holiday 
breaks, and March 3, 2025, is the project start date. Ordering ventilation system, 
new racks, and power supplies/cables takes only one actual day of work. The remain￾ing days are the time necessary for the vendors to fill and ship the order to Brian. So 
use finish-to-start lags here. Assume that five days after the start of the renovation of 
the data center that the raised floor will be ready for inspection (a start-to-start lag).

 Case 6.2
Ventura Baseball Stadium—Part A
The G&E Company is preparing a bid to build the new 47,000-seat Shoreline baseball 
stadium. The construction must start on June 10, 2019, and be completed in time for 
the start of the 2022 season. A penalty clause of $500,000 per day of delay beyond 
April 3rd is written into the contract.
Percival Young, the president of the company, expressed optimism at obtaining the 
contract and revealed that the company could net as much as $5 million on the project. 
He also said that if they were successful, the prospects of future projects would be 
bright, since there is a projected renaissance in building classic ballparks with modern 
luxury boxes.
ASSIGNMENT
Given the information provided in Table 6.3, construct a network schedule for the sta￾dium project and answer the following questions:
1. Can the project be completed by the April 3rd deadline? How long will it take?
2. What is the critical path for the project?
3. Based on the schedule, would you recommend that G&E pursue this contact? Why? 
Include a one-page Gantt chart for the stadium schedule.

Case Appendix
Technical Details for the Ventura Baseball Stadium
The baseball stadium is an outdoor structure with a retractable roof. The project begins 
with clearing the site, an activity that lasts 60 days. Once the site is clear, work can 
start simultaneously on the structure itself and demolition of an adjacent building site. 
This demolition is necessary to create a construction stage for storing materials and 
equipment. It will take 30 days to demolish the buildings and another 30 days to set up 
the construction site.
The work on the stadium begins by driving 160 support pilings, which will take 
120 days. Next comes the pouring of the lower concrete bowl (120 days). Once this is 
done and the construction site has been set up, then the pouring of the main concourse 
(120 days), installation of the playing field (90 days), and construction of the upper 
steel bowl can occur.
Once the concourse and upper bowl are completed, work can start simultane￾ously on building the luxury boxes (90 days), installing the seats (140 days), install￾ing the Jumbotron (30 days), and installing the stadium infrastructure (120 days), 
which includes bathrooms, lockers, restaurants, etc. Once the seats are installed, then 
the steel canopy can be constructed (75 days), followed by installation of the lights 
(30 days). The retractable roof represents the most significant technical challenge to 
the project. Building the roof track supports (90 days) can begin after the lower con￾crete bowl is constructed. At this time the dimensions of the roof can be finalized and 
the construction of the roof at a separate site can begin (180 days). After the roof sup￾ports are completed, then the roof tracks can be installed (90 days). Once the tracks 
and roof are completed, then the roof can be installed and made operational (90 days). 
Once all activities are completed, it will take 20 days to inspect the stadium.
For purposes of this case assume the following:
1. The following holidays are observed: January 1, Martin Luther King Day (third 
Monday in January), Memorial Day (last Monday in May), July 4th, Labor Day 
(first Monday in September), Thanksgiving Day (fourth Thursday in November), 
December 25 and 26.
2. If a holiday falls on a Saturday, Friday will be given as an extra day off, and if it 
falls on a Sunday, Monday will be given as a day off.
3. The construction crew works Monday through Friday.

“The biggest risk is not taking any risk.”
—Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of FACEBOOK.
Every project manager understands risks are inherent in projects, deliveries are 
delayed, accidents happen, people get sick, etc. No amount of planning can over￾come risk, or the inability to control chance events. In the context of projects, risk 
is an uncertain event or condition that if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect 
on project objectives. A risk has a cause and, if it occurs, a consequence. For exam￾ple, a cause may be a flu virus or change in scope requirements. The event is that 
team members get stricken with the flu or the product has to be redesigned. If either 
of these uncertain events occurs, it will impact the cost, schedule, and quality of 
the project.
Some potential risk events can be identified before the project starts—such as 
equipment malfunction or change in technical requirements. Risks can be antici￾pated consequences, like schedule slippages or cost overruns. Other risks are 
beyond most people’s imagination, like the COVID-19 pandemic or the 2008 finan￾cial meltdown.
While risks can have positive consequences such as unexpected price reductions 
in materials, the primary focus of this chapter is on what can go wrong and the risk 
management process.
Risk management attempts to recognize and manage potential and unforeseen trou￾ble spots that may occur when the project is implemented. Risk management identifies 
as many risk events as possible (what can go wrong), minimizes their impact (what 
can be done about the event before the project begins), manages responses to events 
that do materialize (contingency plans), and provides contingency funds to cover risk 
events that actually materialize.
For a humorous, but ultimately embarrassing, example of poor risk management

An attempt to erect the world’s largest 
popsicle in New York City ended with 
a scene straight out of a disaster film, 
but much stickier.
The 25-foot-tall, 17½-ton treat of 
frozen juice melted faster than expected, flooding Union 
Square in downtown Manhattan with kiwi-strawberry–
flavored fluid.
Bicyclists wiped out in the stream of goo. Pedes￾trians slipped. Traffic was, well, frozen. Firefighters 
closed off several streets and used hoses to wash 
away the thick, sweet slime.
The Snapple Company, a leading maker of soft 
beverages, had been trying to promote a new line of 
frozen treats by setting a record for the world’s largest 
popsicle but called off the stunt before the frozen giant 
was pulled fully upright by a construction crane.
Authorities said they were worried the 2½-story 
popsicle would collapse.
Organizers were not sure why it melted so quickly. 
“We planned for it. We just didn’t expect for it to 
happen so fast,” said Snapple spokesperson Lauren 
Radcliffe. Lauren said the company would offer to pay 
the city for the clean-up costs.
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 7.1 Giant Popsicle Gone Wrong*
Brian Smith/Zuma Press, Inc.
*Associated Press, June 23, 2005.
7.1 Risk Management Process
Figure  7.1 presents a graphic model of the risk management challenge. The 
chances of a risk event occurring (e.g., an error in time estimates, cost estimates, 
or design technology) are greatest during the early stages of a project. This is 
when uncertainty is highest and many questions remain unanswered. As the proj￾ect progresses toward completion, risk declines as the answers to critical issues 
(Will the technology work? Is the timeline feasible?) are resolved. The cost impact 
of a risk event, however, increases over the life of the project. For example, the 
risk event of a design flaw occurring after a prototype has been made has a greater 
cost or time impact than if the flaw were discovered during the planning phase of 
the project. 
The cost of mismanaged risk control early on in the project is exemplified by the ill￾fated 1999 NASA Mars Climate Orbiter. Investigations revealed that Lockheed Martin 
had botched the design of critical navigation software. While flight computers on the 
ground did calculations based on pounds of thrust per second, the spacecraft’s com￾puter software used metric units called newtons. A check to see if the values were 
compatible was never done. “Our check and balances processes did not catch an error 
like this that should have been caught,” said Ed Weiler, NASA’s associate adminis￾trator for space science. “That is the bottom line” (Orlando Sentinel, 1999). If the 
error had been discovered early, the correction would have been relatively simple and 
inexpensive. Instead, the error was never discovered, and after the nine-month journey 
to the red planet, the $125-million probe approached Mars at too low an altitude and 
burned up in the planet’s atmosphere.

Following the 1999 debacle, NASA instituted a more robust risk management sys￾tem, which has produced a string of successful missions to Mars, including the dra￾matic landing of the Curiosity rover in August 2012.1
Risk management is a proactive, rather than reactive, approach. It is a preventive 
process designed to ensure that surprises are reduced and that negative consequences 
associated with undesirable events are minimized. It also prepares the project manager 
to take action when a time, cost, and/or technical advantage is possible. Successful 
management of project risk gives the project manager better control over the future 
and can significantly improve the chances of reaching project objectives on time and 
within budget and of meeting required technical (functional) performance.
The sources of project risks are unlimited. There are external sources, such as infla￾tion, market acceptance, exchange rates, and government regulations. In practice, these 
risk events are often referred to as “threats” to differentiate them from those that are 
not within the project manager’s or team’s responsibility area. (Later we will see that 
budgets for such risk events are placed in a “management reserve” contingency bud￾get.) Since such external risks are usually considered before the decision to go ahead 
with the project, they will be excluded from the discussion of project risks. However, 
external risks are extremely important and must be addressed.
The major components of the risk management process are depicted in Figure 7.2. 
Each step will be examined in more detail in the remainder of the chapter. 
7.2 Step 1: Risk Identification
The risk management process begins by trying to generate a list of all the possible 
risks that could affect the project. Typically the project manager pulls together, dur￾ing the planning phase, a risk management team consisting of core team members 
and other relevant stakeholders. Research has demonstrated that groups make more

accurate judgments about risks than individuals do (Snizek & Henry, 1989). The 
team uses brainstorming and other problem-identifying techniques to identify poten￾tial problems. Participants are encouraged to keep an open mind and generate as 
many probable risks as possible. More than one project has been bushwhacked by 
an event that members thought was preposterous in the beginning. Later during the 
assessment phase, participants will have a chance to analyze and filter out unreason￾able risks.
One common mistake that is made early in the risk identification process is to focus 
on objectives and not on the events that could produce consequences. For example, 
team members may identify failing to meet the schedule as a major risk. What they 
need to focus on are the events that could cause this to happen (e.g., poor estimates, 
adverse weather, shipping delays). Only by focusing on actual events can potential 
solutions be found.
Organizations use risk breakdown structures (RBSs) in conjunction with work 
breakdown structures (WBSs) to help management teams identify and eventually 
analyze risks. Figure 7.3 provides a generic example of an RBS. The focus at the 
beginning should be on risks that can affect the whole project, as opposed to a 
specific section of the project or network. For example, the discussion of funding 
may lead the team to identify the possibility of the project budget being cut after 
the project has started as a significant risk event. Likewise, when discussing the 
market, the team may identify responding to new product releases by competitors 
as a risk event.

After the macro risks have been identified, specific areas can be checked. An effective 
tool for identifying specific risks is the risk breakdown structure. The use of the RBS 
reduces the chance a risk event will be missed. On large projects, multiple risk teams 
are organized around specific deliverables and submit their risk management reports to 
the project manager. See Snapshot from Practice 7.2: Terminal 5—London Heathrow 
Airport for an example of a project that would have benefited from a more robust RBS.
A risk profile is another useful tool. A risk profile is a list of questions that address 
traditional areas of uncertainty on a project. These questions have been developed 
and refined from previous, similar projects. Figure 7.4 provides a partial example of 
a risk profile.
Good risk profiles, like RBSs, are tailored to the type of project in question. For 
example, building an information system is different from building a new car. They 
are organization specific. Risk profiles recognize the unique strengths and weak￾nesses of the firm. Finally, risk profiles address both technical and management risks. 
For example, the profile shown in Figure  7.4 asks questions about design, such as 
“Does the design depend upon unrealistic assumptions?” The questions may lead the 
team to identify that the technology will not work under extreme conditions as a risk. 
Similarly, questions about work environment (“Do people cooperate across functional 
boundaries?”) may lead to the identification of potential communication breakdowns 
between Marketing and R&D as a risk.
Risk profiles are generated and maintained usually by personnel from the project 
office. They are updated and refined during the post-project audit (see Chapter 14). 
These profiles, when kept up to date, can be a powerful resource in the risk management 
process. The collective experience of the firm’s past projects resides in their questions.

The queen announced to a select audi￾ence at the ribbon-cutting ceremony for 
Terminal 5 at London Heathrow Airport, 
“It gives me great pleasure to open Ter￾minal 5—the 21st-century gateway to 
Britain and, to us, the wider world.”
At the cost of over $5 billion British Airways (BA) 
was banking on Terminal 5 eliminating what had com￾monly been called the “Heathrow hassle.” Over the 
past decade, Heathrow had earned a reputation for 
baggage delays, long queues, and lost luggage, so 
much so that premium passengers were avoiding 
landing there and paying extra to land in ultra-modern 
hubs, like Amsterdam and Frankfurt.
Terminal 5 was designed by a world-famous archi￾tect and featured sweeping views of London; wide, open 
spaces; and rows of luxury shops, including Tiffany’s 
and a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. It was designed to 
handle 30 million customers a year with state-of-the￾art departure lounges. It included a sophisticated bag￾gage setup designed to handle 12,000 bags per hour 
and eliminate the Heathrow hassle.
March 28, the opening day of the terminal, started 
ominously. The first warning came at 4:00 a.m., when 
many of the staff and passengers began showing up 
late because they could not find parking. The road 
signs outside the terminal were not clear, and people 
said they were given the wrong information once 
inside. Once the staff arrived at work, many were 
unable to log in to the computer system due to inad￾equate training. As a result, the processing of passen￾gers began to bog down, and the luggage began to 
stack up. Technical glitches with the baggage system 
emerged. An underground conveyor system became 
clogged up. By noon, BA had had to cancel 20 flights. 
By 5:00 p.m., BA had suspended the checking in of 
all luggage. This meant passengers at the airport had 
the choice of flying with just hand baggage, getting an 
alternative flight, or claiming a refund. Of all the planes 
that left that day, one in three had no luggage!
That was only day 1; flights were canceled all week 
and BA brought in hundreds of volunteers to tackle the 
baggage mountain. In the end, over 28,000 suitcases 
were shipped to Milan, where they were sorted out 
away from the turmoil in London.
The opening of Terminal 5 was an embarrassment, 
with hundreds of canceled flights and thousands of lost 
bags. It cost BA over $32 million and two senior execu￾tives their jobs. BA later admitted that customers were 
deserting in wake of the Terminal 5 fiasco, with pas￾senger numbers down 7 percent.
What are the lessons to be learned? There are many. 
The first is that on complex projects there is a tendency 
to focus on the technical challenges and shortchange 
the human side of the project. Remember, projects are 
socio-technical systems! A more robust RBS may have 
revealed the need for more training and a walk-through 
before the terminal became operational.
One also must question the wisdom of going 
fully operational on day 1. Going from operating zero 
flights one day to 380 is a formidable task. A more pru￾dent approach may have been to limit the flights the 
first week to work out the kinks and ensure success.

Historical records can complement or be used when formal risk profiles are not 
available. Project teams can investigate what happened on similar projects in the 
past to identify potential risks. For example, a project manager can check the on￾time performance of selected vendors to gauge the threat of shipping delays. IT 
project managers can access “best practices” papers detailing other companies’ 
experiences converting software systems. Inquiries should not be limited to recorded 
data. Savvy project managers tap the wisdom of others by seeking the advice of vet￾eran project managers.
The risk identification process should not be limited to just the core team. Input 
from customers, sponsors, subcontractors, vendors, and other stakeholders should be 
solicited. Relevant stakeholders can be formally interviewed or included on the risk 
management team. Not only do these players have a valuable perspective, but by

involving them in the risk management process they also become more committed to 
project success.2
One of the keys to success in risk identification is attitude. While a “can do” atti￾tude is essential during implementation, project managers have to encourage critical 
thinking when it comes to risk identification. The goal is to find potential problems 
before they happen.
The RBS and risk profiles are useful tools for making sure no stones are left 
unturned. At the same time, when done well the number of risks identified can be 
overwhelming and a bit discouraging. Initial optimism can be replaced with griping 
and cries of “What have we gotten ourselves into?” It is important that project manag￾ers set the right tone and complete the risk management process so members regain 
confidence in themselves and the project.
7.3 Step 2: Risk Assessment
Step 1 produces a list of potential risks. Not all of these risks deserve attention, how￾ever. Some are trivial and can be ignored, while others pose serious threats to the 
welfare of the project. Managers have to develop methods for sifting through the list 
of risks, eliminating inconsequential or redundant ones, and stratifying worthy ones in 
terms of importance and need for attention.
Scenario analysis is the easiest and most commonly used technique for analyzing 
risks. Team members assess the significance of each risk event in terms of
∙ Probability of the event.
∙ Impact of the event.
Simply stated, risks need to be evaluated in terms of the likelihood the event is going 
to occur and the impact or consequences of its occurrence. A project manager being

struck by lightning at a work site would have a major negative impact on the project, 
but the likelihood of such an event is so low that the risk is not worthy of consideration. 
Conversely, people do change jobs, so an event like the loss of key project personnel 
would have not only an adverse impact but also a high likelihood of occurring in some 
organizations. If so, then it would be wise for that organization to be proactive and 
mitigate this risk by developing incentive schemes for retaining specialists and/or 
engaging in cross-training to reduce the impact of turnover.
The quality and credibility of the risk analysis process require that different levels of 
risk probabilities and impacts be defined. These definitions vary and should be tailored 
to the specific nature and needs of the project. For example, a relatively simple scale 
ranging from “very unlikely” to “almost certainly” may suffice for one project, whereas 
another project may use more precise numeric probabilities (e.g., 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, . . .).
Impact scales can be a bit more problematic, since adverse risks affect project 
objectives differently. For example, a component failure may cause only a slight delay 
in project schedule but a major increase in project cost. If controlling cost is a high 
priority, then the impact would be severe. If, on the other hand, time is more critical 
than cost, then the impact would be minor.
Because impact ultimately needs to be assessed in terms of project priorities, differ￾ent kinds of impact scales are used. Some scales may simply use rank-order descrip￾tors, such as “low,” “moderate,” “high,” and “very high,” whereas others use numeric 
weights (e.g., 1–10). Some may focus on the project in general, whereas others focus 
on specific project objectives. The risk management team needs to establish up front 
what distinguishes a 1 from a 3 or “moderate” impact from “severe” impact. Figure 7.5 
provides an example of how impact scales could be defined, given the project objec￾tives of cost, time, scope, and quality.

Documentation of scenario analyses can be seen in various risk assessment forms 
used by companies. Figure 7.6 is a partial example of a risk assessment form used on 
an information systems project involving an operating systems (OS) upgrade.
Notice that in addition to evaluating the severity and probability of risk events, the 
team also assesses when the event might occur and its detection difficulty. Detection 
difficulty is a measure of how easy it would be to detect that the event was going to 
occur in time to take mitigating action, that is, how much warning there would be. 
So in the OS upgrade example, the detection scale would range from 5 = no warning 
to 1 = lots of time to react.
Often, organizations find it useful to categorize the severity of different risks into 
some form of risk assessment matrix. The matrix is typically structured around the 
impact and likelihood of the risk event. For example, the risk matrix presented in 
Figure 7.7 consists of a 5 × 5 array of elements with each element representing a dif￾ferent set of impact and likelihood values.

The matrix is divided into red, yellow, and green zones representing major, moder￾ate, and minor risks, respectively. The red zone is centered on the top right corner of 
the matrix (high impact/high likelihood), while the green zone is centered on the bot￾tom left corner (low impact/low likelihood). The moderate-risk yellow zone extends 
down the middle of the matrix. Since the impact is generally considered more impor￾tant than likelihood (a 10 percent chance of losing $1,000,000 is usually considered a 
more severe risk than a 90 percent chance of losing $1,000), the red zone (major risk) 
extends farther down the high-impact column.
Using the OS upgrade project again as an example, interface problems and system 
freezing would be placed in the red zone (major risk), while user backlash and hard￾ware malfunctioning would be placed in the yellow zone (moderate risk).
The risk severity matrix provides a basis for prioritizing which risks to address. 
Red zone risks receive first priority followed by yellow zone risks. Green zone risks 
are typically considered inconsequential and ignored unless their status changes.
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) extends the risk severity matrix by 
including ease of detection in the equation:
Impact × Probability × Detection = Risk Value
Each of the three dimensions is rated according to a 5-point scale. For example, 
detection is defined as the ability of the project team to discern that the risk event 
is imminent. A score of 1 would be given if even a chimpanzee could spot the risk 
coming. The highest detection score of 5 would be given to events that could only be 
discovered after it was too late (e.g., system freezing). Similar anchored scales would 
be applied for the severity of impact and the probability of the event occurring. The 
weighting of the risks is then based on their overall score. For example, a risk with an 
impact in the “1” zone with a very low probability and an easy detection score might 
score a 1 (1 × 1 × 1 = 1). Conversely, a high-impact risk that is highly probable and 
impossible to detect would score 125 (5 × 5 × 5 = 125). This broad range of numeric 
scores allows for easy stratification of risk according to overall significance.
No assessment scheme is absolutely foolproof. For example, the weakness of the 
FMEA approach is that a risk event rated Impact = 1, Probability = 5, and Detection = 5 
would receive the same weighted score as an event rated Impact = 5, Probability = 5, 
and Detection = 1! This underscores the importance of not treating risk assessment as 
simply an exercise in mathematics. Risk assessment tools should be used to guide dis￾cussions, not to make decisions. There is no substitute for an engaged discussion of key 
risk events.
Probability Analysis
There are many statistical techniques available to the project manager that can assist 
in assessing project risk. Decision trees have been used to assess alternative courses 
of action using expected values. Statistical variations of net present value (NPV) have 
been used to assess cash flow risks in projects. Correlations between past projects’ 
cash flow and S-curves (cumulative project cost curve—baseline—over the life of the 
project) have been used to assess cash flow risks.
PERT (program evaluation and review technique) and PERT simulation can be 
used to review activity and project risk. PERT and related techniques take a more 
macro perspective by looking at overall cost and schedule risks. Here the focus is not 
on individual events but on the likelihood the project will be completed on time and 
within budget. These methods are useful in assessing the overall risk of the project 
and the need for such things as contingency funds, resources, and time. The use of 
Final PDF to printer230 Chapter 7 Managing Risk
lar60886_ch07_219-264.indd 230 10/14/23 11:43 am
PERT simulation is increasing because it uses the same data required for PERT, and 
software to perform the simulation is readily available.
Basically, PERT simulation assumes a statistical distribution (range between 
optimistic and pessimistic) for each activity duration; it then simulates the network 
(perhaps over 1,000 simulations) using a random number generator. The outcome is the 
relative probability, called a criticality index, of an activity becoming critical under 
the many different possible activity durations for each activity. PERT simulation also 
provides a list of potential critical paths and their respective probabilities of occurring. 
Having this information available can greatly facilitate identifying and assessing 
schedule risk. (See Appendix 7.1 at the end of this chapter for a more detailed descrip￾tion and discussion.)
7.4 Step 3: Risk Response Development
When a risk event is identified and assessed, a decision must be made concerning 
which response is appropriate for the specific event. Responses to risk can be classi￾fied as mitigating, avoiding, transferring, escalating, or retaining.
Mitigating Risk
Reducing risk is usually the first alternative considered. There are basically two strat￾egies for mitigating risk: (1) reduce the likelihood that the event will occur and/or 
(2)  reduce the impact that the adverse event would have on the project. Most risk 
teams focus first on reducing the likelihood of risk events, since if successful this may 
eliminate the need to consider the potentially costly second strategy.
Testing, experimenting, and prototyping are frequently used to resolve project 
ambiguities and to prevent problems from escalating. An example of testing can 
be found in an information systems project. The project team was responsible for 
installing a new operating system in their parent company. Before implementing the 
project, the team tested the new system on a smaller, isolated network. By doing 
so they discovered a variety of problems and were able to come up with solutions 
prior to implementation. The team still encountered problems with the installation, 
but the number and severity were greatly reduced. Experiments can be used to test 
assumptions. For example, before committing to a new high-tech adhesive, a proj￾ect team ran experiments with the adhesive under different conditions. Prototypes 
are especially useful for checking if “things fit together” and soliciting feedback 
from customers.
Often, identifying the root causes of an event is useful. For example, the fear that 
a vendor will be unable to supply customized components on time may be attribut￾able to (1) poor vendor relationships, (2) design miscommunication, and (3) lack of 
motivation. As a result of this analysis, the project manager may decide to take his/her 
counterpart to lunch to clear the air, invite the vendor to attend design meetings, and 
restructure the contract to include incentives for on-time delivery.
Other examples of reducing the probability of risks occurring are scheduling out￾door work during the summer months, investing in up-front safety training, and choos￾ing high-quality materials and equipment.
When the concerns are that duration and costs have been underestimated, managers 
will augment estimates to compensate for the uncertainties. It is common to use a ratio 
between old and new projects to adjust time or cost. The ratio typically serves as a con￾stant. For example, if past projects have taken 10 minutes per line of computer code, a

constant of 1.10 (which represents a 10 percent increase) would be used for the proposed 
project time estimates because the new project is more difficult than prior projects.
An alternative mitigation strategy is to reduce the impact of the risk if it occurs. For 
example, a bridge-building project illustrates risk reduction. A new bridge project 
for a coastal port was to use an innovative, continuous cement-pouring process devel￾oped by an Australian firm to save large sums of money and time. The major risk was 
that the continuous pouring process for each major section of the bridge could not be 
interrupted. Any interruption would require that the whole cement section (hundreds 
of cubic yards) be torn down and started over. An assessment of possible risks cen￾tered on the delivery of the cement from the cement factory. Trucks could be delayed, 
or the factory could break down. Such risks would result in tremendous rework costs 
and delays. Risk was reduced by having two additional portable cement plants built 
nearby on different highways within 20 miles of the bridge project in case the main 
factory supply was interrupted. These two portable plants carried raw materials for a 
whole bridge section, and extra trucks were on immediate standby each time continu￾ous pouring was required. Similar risk reduction scenarios are apparent in system and 
software development projects where parallel innovation processes are used in case 
one fails.
In the project management lexicon, mitigating a risk refers to a very specific strat￾egy of reducing the probability and/or impact of the threat. However, in any everyday 
language, mitigating refers to any action that reduces or diminishes a risk, which could 
include the other following responses.
Snapshot from Practice 7.3: From Dome to Dust details the steps Controlled Demo￾lition took to minimize damage when they imploded the Seattle Kingdome.
Avoiding Risk
Avoiding risk is changing the project plan to eliminate the risk or condition. Although 
it is impossible to eliminate all risk events, some specific risks may be avoided before 
you launch the project. For example, adopting proven technology instead of experi￾mental technology can eliminate technical failure. Choosing an Australian supplier 
as opposed to a Ukraine supplier would virtually eliminate the chance that political 
unrest would disrupt the supply of critical materials. Likewise, one could eliminate 
the risk of choosing the wrong software by developing web applications using both 
Java and PHP. Choosing to move a concert indoors would eliminate the threat of 
inclement weather.
Transferring Risk
Transferring risk to another party is common; this transfer does not change risk. 
Passing risk to another party almost always results in paying a premium for this 
exemption. Fixed-price contracts are the classic example of transferring risk from an 
owner to a contractor. The contractor understands her firm will pay for any risk event 
that materializes; therefore, a monetary risk factor is added to the contract bid price. 
Before deciding to transfer risk, the owner should decide which party can best con￾trol activities that would lead to the risk occurring. Also, is the contractor capable of 
absorbing the risk? Clearly identifying and documenting responsibility for absorbing 
risk is imperative.
Another, more obvious way to transfer risk is insurance. However, in most cases, 
this is impractical because defining the project risk event and conditions to an insur￾ance broker who is unfamiliar with the project is difficult and usually expensive. 
Of  course, low-probability and high-consequence risk events such as acts of God

On March 26, 2000, the largest con￾crete domed structure in the world was 
reduced to a pile of rubble in a dramatic 
implosion lasting less than 20 seconds. 
According to Mark Loizeaux, whose 
Maryland-based Controlled Demolition Inc. was hired 
to bring the 24-year-old Seattle Kingdome down, “We 
don’t blow things up. We use explosives as an engine, 
but gravity is the catalyst that will bring it down.”
Destroying the Kingdome was the most compli￾cated of the 7,000 demolitions Loizeaux’s company 
had undertaken. Nearly three months of preparations 
were needed to implode the dome, at a total cost of 
$9 million. The Kingdome was considered to be one of 
the strongest structures in the world, containing over 
25,000 tons of concrete, with each of its 40 vaulted 
ribs incorporating seven lengths of 2¼-inch reinforcing

24,000 feet per second—connected six pielike divi￾sions of the Kingdome to a nearby control center.
Throughout each section, Controlled Demolition 
workers drilled nearly 1,000 holes and packed them 
with high-velocity gelatin explosives the size of hot 
dogs. Large charges were placed about one-third of 
the way up each dome rib; smaller charges were put 
farther up the ribs. When the detonation button was 
pushed, blasting caps set off a chain reaction of explo￾sions in each section, reducing the stadium to rubble.
While the actual implosion was a technical tour￾de-force, risk management was a critical part of the 
project’s success. To minimize damage to surround￾ing buildings, the explosive charges were wrapped in 
a layer of chain-link fencing covered with thick sheets 
of geotextile polypropylene fabric to contain flying 
concrete. Nearby buildings were protected in various 
manners depending on the structure and proximity

to the Dome. Measures included sealing air-handling 
units, taping seams on doors and windows, covering 
floors and windows with plywood, and draping rein￾forced polyethylene sheeting around the outside.
To help absorb the impact, air-conditioning units 
removed from the interior were stacked with other 
materials to create a barrier around the perimeter of 
the work area.
Hundreds of police officers and security person￾nel were used to cordon off an area extending roughly 
1,000 feet from the Dome from overzealous specta￾tors. Traffic was closed for a larger area. Accommo￾dations were provided for people and pets who lived 
within the restricted zone.
Eight water trucks, eight sweeper units, and more 
than 100 workers were deployed immediately after the 
blast to control dust and begin the cleanup.
As a side note, one-third of the concrete was crushed 
and used in the foundation of a new $430-million out￾door football stadium, which was built in its place. The 
rest of the concrete was carted away and used in road￾beds and foundations throughout the Seattle area.

are more easily defined and insured. Performance bonds, warranties, and guarantees 
are other financial instruments used to transfer risk.
On large, international construction projects like petrochemical plants and oil 
refineries, host countries are insisting on contracts that enforce Build-Own-Operate￾Transfer (BOOT) provisions. Here the prime project organization is expected not only 
to build the facility but also to take over ownership until its operation capacity has 
been proven and all the debugging has occurred before final transfer of ownership to 
the client. In such cases, the host country has transferred financial risk of ownership 
until the project has been completed and capabilities are proven.

Escalating Risk
Escalating risk occurs when the project encounters a threat that is outside the scope of 
the project or the authority of the project manager. In such cases, the response should 
be to notify the appropriate people within the organization of the threat. For example, 
while working on a high-tech product, an engineer discovers through informal chan￾nels that a competitor is developing an alternative energy source. While this would not 
impact the current project, it may have significant implications for future products. 
The project manager would forward this information to the product manager and head 
of R&D. In another example, informal discussions with team members reveal wide￾spread dissatisfaction with pay and benefits among staff across the company. This 
threat would be escalated to the Human Resource Department. Escalated risks are not 
monitored further by the project team.
Retaining Risk
Retaining risk occurs when a conscious decision is made to accept the risk of an event 
occurring. Some risks are so large it is not feasible to consider transferring or reducing 
the event (e.g., an earthquake). The project owner assumes the risk because the chance 
of such an event occurring is slim. In other cases, risks identified in the budget reserve 
can simply be absorbed if they materialize. The risk is retained by developing a con￾tingency plan to implement if the risk materializes. In a few cases a risk event can be 
ignored and a cost overrun accepted, should the risk event occur.
People vary in their risk tolerance. Before deciding how to respond to a risk, one 
should consider the risk appetite of key stakeholders as well as your team.
7.5 Contingency Planning
A contingency plan is an alternative plan that will be used if a possible foreseen 
risk event becomes a reality. The contingency plan represents actions that will reduce 
or mitigate the negative impact of the risk event. A key distinction between a risk 
response and a contingency plan is that a response is part of the actual implementa￾tion plan and action is taken before the risk can materialize, while a contingency plan 
is not part of the initial implementation plan and only goes into effect after the risk is 
recognized.
Like all plans, the contingency plan answers the questions of what, where, when, 
and how much action will take place. The absence of a contingency plan, when a 
risk event occurs, can cause a manager to delay or postpone the decision to imple￾ment a remedy. This postponement can lead to panic and acceptance of the first 
remedy suggested. Such after-the-event decision making under pressure can be dan￾gerous and costly. Contingency planning evaluates alternative remedies for possible 
foreseen events before the risk event occurs and selects the best plan among alterna￾tives. This early contingency planning facilitates a smooth transition to the remedy or 
work-around plan. The availability of a contingency plan can significantly increase the 
chances for project success.
Conditions for activating the implementation of the contingency plan should be 
decided and clearly documented. The plan should include a cost estimate and identify 
the source of funding. All parties affected should agree to the contingency plan and 
have authority to make commitments. Because implementation of a contingency plan 
embodies disruption in the sequence of work, all contingency plans should be com￾municated to team members so that surprise and resistance are minimized.

Here is an example: A high-tech niche computer company intends to introduce a 
new “platform” product at a very specific target date. The project’s 47 teams all agree 
delays will not be acceptable. Their contingency plans for two large component sup￾pliers demonstrate how seriously risk management is viewed. One supplier’s plant sits 
on the San Andreas Fault, which is prone to earthquakes. The contingency plan has an 
alternative supplier, who is constantly updated, producing a replica of the component 
in another plant. Another key supplier in Toronto, Canada, presents a delivery risk on 
their due date because of potential bad weather. This contingency plan calls for a char￾tered plane (already contracted to be on standby) if overland transportation presents 
a delay problem. To outsiders, these plans must seem a bit extreme, but in high-tech 
industries where time to market is king, risks of identified events are taken seriously.
Risk response matrices such as the one shown in Figure 7.8 are useful for summa￾rizing how the project team plans to manage risks that have been identified. Again, the 
OS upgrade project is used to illustrate this kind of matrix. The first step is to identify 
whether to mitigate, avoid, transfer, escalate, or retain the risk. The team decides to 
reduce the chances of the system freezing by experimenting with a prototype of the 
system. Prototype experimentation not only allows them to identify and fix conversion 
“bugs” before the actual installation but also yields information that could be useful 
in enhancing acceptance by end users. The project team is then able to identify and 
document changes between the old and new systems that will be incorporated into the 
training the users receive. The risk of equipment malfunction is transferred by choos￾ing a reliable supplier with a strong warranty program.
The next step is to identify contingency plans in case the risk still occurs. For exam￾ple, if interface problems prove insurmountable, then the team will attempt a work￾around until vendor experts arrive to help solve the problem. If the system freezes after 
installation, the team will first try to reinstall the software. If user dissatisfaction is 
high, then the Information Systems (IS) Department will provide more staff support. 
If the team is unable to get reliable equipment from the original supplier, then it will 
order a different brand from a second dealer. The team also needs to discuss and agree 
what would “trigger” implementation of the contingency plan. In the case of the sys￾tem freezing, the trigger is not being able to unfreeze the system within one hour or, in 
the case of user backlash, an angry call from top management. Finally, the individual 
responsible for monitoring the potential risk and initiating the contingency plan needs 
to be assigned. Smart project managers establish protocols for contingency responses 
before they are needed. For an example of the importance of establishing protocols, 
see Snapshot from Practice 7.4: Risk Management at the Top of the World.

The gripping account in the 2015 film 
Everest of an ill-fated attempt to climb 
Mount Everest in which six climbers 
died provides testimony to the risks of 
extreme mountain climbing.
Accounts of Mount Everest expeditions provide 
insights into project risk management. First, most 
climbers spend more than three weeks acclimating 
their bodies to high-altitude conditions. Native Sherpas 
are used extensively to carry supplies and set up each 
of the four base camps that will be used during the final 
stages of the climb. To reduce the impact of hypoxia, 
lightheadedness, and disorientation caused by short￾age of oxygen, most climbers use oxygen masks and 
bottles during the final ascent. If lucky enough not to 
be one of the first expeditions of the season, the path 
to the summit should be staked out and roped by pre￾vious climbers. Climbing guides receive last-minute 
weather reports by radio to confirm whether the 
weather conditions warrant the risk. Finally, for added 
insurance, most climbers join their Sherpas in an elabo￾rate puja ritual intended to summon the divine support 
of the gods before beginning their ascent.
All of these efforts pale next to the sheer physical 
and mental rigors of making the final climb from base 
camp IV to the summit. This is what climbers refer to 
as the “death zone” because beyond 26,000 feet the 
mind and body begin to quickly deteriorate despite 
supplemental oxygen. Under fair conditions, it takes 
around 18 hours to make the round-trip to the top and 
back to the base camp. Climbers leave as early as 1:00 
a.m. in order to make it back before night falls and total 
exhaustion sets in.
The greatest danger in climbing Mount Everest is 
not in reaching the summit but in making it back to the 
base camp. One out of every five climbers who make 
it to the summit dies during their descent. The key is 
establishing a contingency plan in case the climbers 
encounter hard going or the weather changes. Guides 
establish a predetermined turnaround time (e.g., 2:00 
p.m.) to ensure a safe return no matter how close the 
climbers are to the summit. Many lives have been lost 
by failing to adhere to the turnaround time and push￾ing forward to the summit. As one climber put it, “With 
enough determination, any bloody idiot can get to the 
top of the hill. The trick is to get back alive.”
One climber who faced the 2:00 p.m. deadline was 
Goran Krupp. After cycling 8,000 miles from Stock￾holm to Katmandu he turned back 1,000 feet from 
the summit.

Some of the most common methods for handling risk are discussed in the 
following sections.
Technical Risks
Technical risks are problematic; they can often be the kind that cause the project to be 
shut down. What if the system or process does not work? Contingency plans are made 
for those possibilities that are foreseen. For example, Carrier Transicold was involved 
Final PDF to printer236 Chapter 7 Managing Risk
lar60886_ch07_219-264.indd 236 10/14/23 11:43 am
in developing a new Phoenix refrigeration unit for truck-trailer applications. This new 
unit was to use rounded panels made of bonded metals, which at the time was new tech￾nology for Transicold. Furthermore, one of its competitors had tried unsuccessfully to 
incorporate similar bonded metals into the products. The project team was eager to make 
the new technology work, but it wasn’t until the very end of the project that they were 
able to get the new adhesives to bond adequately to complete the project. Throughout the 
project, the team maintained a welded-panel fabrication approach just in case they were 
unsuccessful. If this contingency approach had been needed, it would have increased 
production costs, but the project still would have been completed on time.
In addition to backup strategies, project managers need to develop methods to 
quickly assess whether technical uncertainties can be resolved. The use of sophisti￾cated computer-aided design (CAD) software has greatly helped resolve design prob￾lems. At the same time, Smith and Reinertsen (1995), in their book Developing 
Products in Half the Time, argue that there is no substitute for making something and 
seeing how it works, feels, or looks. They suggest that one should first identify the 
high-risk technical areas, then build models or design experiments to resolve the risk 
as quickly as possible. Technology offers many methods for early testing and valida￾tion, ranging from 3-D printing and holographic imagery for model building to focus 
groups and early design usability testing for market testing (Thamhain, 2013). By iso￾lating and testing the key technical questions early in a project, project feasibility can 
be quickly determined and necessary adjustments made, such as reworking the process 
or in some cases closing down the project.3
Schedule Risks
Often, organizations will defer the threat of a project coming in late until it surfaces. 
Here, contingency funds are set aside to expedite or “crash” the project to get it back on 
track. Crashing, or reducing project duration, is accomplished by shortening (compress￾ing) one or more activities on the critical path. This comes with additional costs and risk. 
Techniques for managing this situation are discussed in Chapter 9. Some contingency 
plans can avoid costly procedures. For example, schedules can be altered by working 
activities in parallel or using start-to-start lag relationships. Also, using the best people 
for high-risk tasks can relieve or lessen the chance of some risk events occurring.
Cost Risks
Projects of long duration need some contingency for price changes—which are usually 
upward. The important point to remember when reviewing price is to avoid the trap 
of using one lump sum to cover price risks. For example, if inflation has been running 
about 3 percent, some managers add 3 percent for all resources used in the project. 
This lump-sum approach does not address exactly where price protection is needed 
and fails to provide for tracking and control. On cost-sensitive projects, price risks 
should be evaluated item by item. Some purchases and contracts will not change over 
the life of the project. Those that may change should be identified and estimates made 
of the magnitude of change. This approach ensures control of the contingency funds as 
the project is implemented.
Funding Risks
What if the funding for the project is cut by 25 percent or completion projections indi￾cate that costs will greatly exceed available funds? What are the chances of the project 
3
 This is a key principle of Agile project management, which is discussed in Chapter 15.

being canceled before completion? Seasoned project managers recognize that a com￾plete risk assessment must include an evaluation of funding supply. This is especially 
true for publicly funded projects. Case in point was the ill-fated ARH-70 Arapaho 
helicopter being developed for the U.S. Army by Bell Aircraft. Over $300 million had 
been invested to develop a new-age combat and reconnaissance helicopter, when in 
October 2008 the Defense Department recommended that the project be canceled. The 
cancellation reflected a need to cut costs and a switch toward using unmanned aircraft 
for surveillance as well as attack missions.
Just as government projects are subject to changes in strategy and political agenda, 
business firms frequently undergo changes in priorities and top management. The 
pet projects of the new CEO replace the pet projects of the former CEO. Resources 
become tight, and one way to fund new projects is to cancel other projects.
Severe budget cuts or lack of adequate funding can have a devastating effect on a 
project. Typically when such a fate occurs, there is a need to scale back the scope of 
the project to what is possible. “All-or-nothing projects” are ripe targets to budget cut￾ters. This was the case of the Arapaho helicopter once the decision was made to move 
away from staffed reconnaissance aircraft. Here, the “chunkability” of the project can 
be an advantage. For example, freeway projects can fall short of the original intentions 
but still add value for each mile completed.
On a much smaller scale, similar funding risks may exist for more mundane projects. 
For example, a building contractor may find that due to a sudden downturn in the stock 
market, the owners can no longer afford to build their dream house. Or, an IS consulting 
firm may be left empty handed when a client files for bankruptcy. In the former case, 
the contractor may have as a contingency selling the house on the open market, while 
unfortunately, the consulting firm will have to join the long line of creditors.
7.6 Opportunity Management
For the sake of brevity, this chapter has focused on negative risks—what can go wrong 
on a project. There is a flip side—what can go right on a project. This is commonly 
referred to as a positive risk or an opportunity. An opportunity is an event that can have 
a positive impact on project objectives. For example, unusually favorable weather can 
accelerate construction work, or a drop in fuel prices may create savings that could be 
used to add value to a project. Essentially the same process that is used to manage nega￾tive risks is applied to positive risks. Opportunities are identified, assessed in terms of 
likelihood and impact, responses are determined, and even contingency plans and funds 
can be established to take advantage of the opportunity if it occurs. The major excep￾tion between managing negative risks and opportunity is in the responses. The project 
management profession has identified five types of responses to an opportunity4
:
Exploit. This tactic seeks to eliminate the uncertainty associated with an oppor￾tunity to ensure that it definitely happens. Examples include assigning your best 
personnel to a critical burst activity to reduce the time to completion and revising 
a design to enable a component to be purchased rather than developed internally.
Share. This strategy involves allocating some or all of the ownership of an oppor￾tunity to another party who is best able to capture the opportunity for the benefit 
of the project. Examples include continuous improvement incentives for external 
contractors and joint ventures.

approaches to respond￾ing to opportunities in a

Final PDF to printer238 Chapter 7 Managing Risk
lar60886_ch07_219-264.indd 238 10/14/23 11:43 am
Enhance. Enhance is the opposite of mitigate in that action is taken to increase the 
probability and/or the positive impact of an opportunity. Examples include choos￾ing a site location based on favorable weather patterns and choosing raw materials 
that are likely to decline in price.
Escalate. Sometimes projects encounter opportunities that are outside the scope 
of the project or exceed the authority of the project manager. In such cases, the 
project manager should notify the appropriate people within the organization of 
the opportunity. For example, a customer is considering adapting the product to a 
different market and wonders whether the project manager would be interested in 
bidding on the work. The opportunity is passed upward to the project sponsor. Or 
through the course of project interactions, the project manager discovers an alter￾native supplier for a key component. This information would be passed on to the 
Procurement Department.
Accept. Accepting an opportunity is willing to take advantage of it if it occurs, but 
not taking action to pursue it.
While it is only natural to focus on negative risks, it is sound practice to engage in 
active opportunity management as well. Sometimes necessity creates a search for 
opportunities. For example, Ocean Fresh, a popular seafood restaurant on the Oregon 
Coast, like other establishments closed its doors for months during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Facing dire financial difficulties, the staff launched project “Dock Box.” 
The cooking staff would package prepared meals of popular seafood dishes and 
deliver them twice a week to nearby cities in Oregon. Everything was freshly cut, 
measured for use and with foolproof instructions. Even one of the authors was able to 
create a gourmet seafood dish! Meals were described and ordered online with central￾ized pickup spots twice a week in four Oregon locales. Customer demand exceeded 
expectations. Ocean Fresh went from a minimal local takeout business to selling 700+ 
meals every Wednesday and Friday in Oregon. Dock Box continues to be a vital part 
of the restaurant’s business today.
7.7 Contingency Funding and Time Buffers
Contingency funds are established to cover project risks—identified and unknown. 
When, where, and how much money will be spent are not known until the risk event 
occurs. Project “owners” are often reluctant to set up project contingency funds that 
seem to imply the project plan might be a poor one. Some perceive the contingency 
fund as an add-on slush fund. Others say they will face the risk when it materializes. 
Usually, such reluctance to establish reserve funds can be overcome with documented 
risk identification, assessment, contingency plans, and plans for when and how funds 
will be disbursed.
The size and amount of contingency funds depend on uncertainty inherent in the 
project. Uncertainty is reflected in the “newness” of the project, inaccurate time and 
cost estimates, technical unknowns, unstable scope, and problems not anticipated. 
In practice, contingencies run from 1 to 10 percent in projects similar to past proj￾ects. However, in unique and high-technology projects, it is not uncommon to find 
contingencies running in the 20–60 percent range. Use and rate of consumption of 
reserves must be closely monitored and controlled. Simply picking a percentage of 
the baseline—say, 5 percent—and calling it the contingency reserve is not a sound 
approach. Also, adding up all the identified contingency allotments and throwing them 
into one pot is not conducive to sound control of the reserve fund.
LO 7-7
Understand how contin￾gency funds and time 
buffers are used to man￾age risks on a project.
Final PDF to printerChapter 7 Managing Risk 239
lar60886_ch07_219-264.indd 239 10/14/23 11:43 am
In practice, the contingency fund is typically divided into contingency and manage￾ment reserve funds for control purposes. Contingency reserves are set up to cover 
identified risks; these reserves are allocated to specific segments or deliverables of the 
project. Management reserves are set up to cover unidentified risks and are allocated 
to risks associated with the total project. The risks are separated because their use 
requires approval from different levels of project authority. Because all risks are prob￾abilistic, the reserves are not included in the baseline for each work package or activ￾ity; they are only activated when a risk occurs. If an identified risk does not occur and 
its chance of occurring is past, the fund allocated to the risk should be deducted from 
the contingency reserves. (This removes the temptation to use contingency reserves 
for other issues or problems.) Of course, if the risk does occur, funds are removed from 
the reserve and added to the cost baseline.
It is important that contingency allowances be independent of the original time and 
cost estimates. These allowances need to be clearly distinguished to avoid time 
and budget game playing.
Contingency Reserves
These reserves are identified for specific work packages or segments of a project 
found in the baseline budget or work breakdown structure. For example, a reserve 
amount might be added to “computer coding” to cover the risk of “testing” showing 
a coding problem. The reserve amount is determined by costing out the accepted 
contingency or recovery plan. The contingency reserves should be communicated 
to the project team. This openness suggests trust and encourages good cost per￾formance. However, distributing contingency reserves should be the responsibility 
of both the project manager and the team members responsible for implementing 
the specific segment of the project. If the risk does not materialize, the funds are 
removed from the contingency reserves. Thus, contingency reserves decrease as the 
project progresses.
Management Reserves
These reserve funds are needed to cover major unforeseen risks and, hence, are applied 
to the total project. For example, a major scope change may appear necessary midway 
in the project. Because this change was not anticipated, it is covered from the manage￾ment reserves. Management reserves are established after contingency reserves are 
identified and funds are established. These reserves are independent of contingency 
reserves and are controlled by the project manager and the “owner” of the project. 
The “owner” can be internal (top management) or external to the project organization. 
Most management reserves are set using historical data and judgments concerning the 
uniqueness and complexity of the project.
Placing technical contingencies in the management reserves is a special case. Iden￾tifying possible technical (functional) risks is often associated with a new, untried, 
innovative process or product. Because there is a chance the innovation may not work 
out, a fallback plan is necessary. This type of risk is beyond the control of the proj￾ect manager. Hence, technical reserves are held in the management reserves and con￾trolled by the owner or top management. The owner and project manager decide when 
the contingency plan will be implemented and the management reserve funds used. It 
is assumed there is a high probability these funds will never be used.
Table 7.1 shows the development of a budget estimate for a hypothetical project. 
Note how contingency and management reserves are kept separate; control is easily 
tracked using this format.

lar60886_ch07_219-264.indd 240 10/14/23 11:43 am
Time Buffers
Just as contingency funds are established to absorb unplanned costs, managers use time 
buffers to cushion against potential delays in the project. And like contingency funds, 
the amount of time is dependent upon the inherent uncertainty of the project. The more 
uncertain the project is, the more time should be reserved for the schedule. The strategy is 
to assign extra time at critical moments in the project. For example, buffers are added to:
A. Activities with severe risks.
B. Merge activities that are prone to delays due to one or more preceding activities 
being late.
C. Noncritical activities to reduce the likelihood that they will create another criti￾cal path.
D. Activities that require scarce resources to ensure that the resources are available 
when needed.
In the face of overall schedule uncertainty, buffers are sometimes added to the end of 
the project. For example, a 300-working-day project may have a 30-day project buf￾fer. While the extra 30 days would not appear on the schedule, they are available if 
needed. Like management reserves, this buffer typically requires the authorization of 
top management. A more systematic approach to buffer management is discussed in 
the Chapter 8 appendix on critical-chain project management.
7.8 Step 4: Risk Response Control
Typically the results of the first three steps of the risk management process are sum￾marized in a formal document often called the risk register. A risk register details 
all identified risks, including descriptions, category, probability of occurring, impact, 
responses, contingency plans, owners, and current status. The register is the backbone 
for the last step in the risk management process: risk control. Risk control involves 
executing the risk response strategy, monitoring triggering events, initiating contin￾gency plans, and watching for new risks. Establishing a change management system to 
deal with events that require formal changes in the scope, budget, and/or schedule of 
the project is an essential element of risk control.
Project managers need to monitor risks just as they track project progress. Risk 
assessment and updating need to be part of every status meeting and progress report 
system. The project team needs to be on constant alert for new, unforeseen risks. 
Thamhain (2013) studied 35 major product development efforts and found that over 
half of the contingencies that occurred were not anticipated! Readiness to respond to 
the unexpected is a critical element of risk management.

Management needs to be sensitive that others may not be forthright in acknowledg￾ing new risks and problems. Admitting that there might be a bug in the design code 
or that different components are not compatible reflects poorly on individual perfor￾mance. If the prevailing organizational culture is one where mistakes are punished 
severely, then it is only human nature to protect oneself. Similarly, if bad news is 
greeted harshly and there is a propensity to “kill the messenger,” then participants will 
be reluctant to speak freely. The tendency to suppress bad news is compounded when 
individual responsibility is vague and the project team is under extreme pressure from 
top management to get the project done quickly and within budget.
Project managers need to establish an environment in which participants feel com￾fortable raising concerns and admitting mistakes (Browning & Ramasesh, 2015). The 
norm should be that mistakes are acceptable and hiding mistakes is intolerable. Prob￾lems should be embraced, not denied. Participants should be encouraged to identify 
problems and new risks. A positive attitude by the project manager toward risks is key.
On large, complex projects, it may be prudent to repeat the risk identification/
assessment exercise with fresh information. Risk profiles should be reviewed to test 
if the original responses held true. Relevant stakeholders should be brought into the 
discussion and the risk register needs to be updated. While this may not be practical on 
an ongoing basis, project managers should touch base with them on a regular basis or 
hold special stakeholder meetings to review the status of risks on the project.
A second key for controlling the cost of risks is documenting responsibility. This can 
be problematic in projects involving multiple organizations and contractors. Respon￾sibility for risk is frequently passed on to others with the statement “That is not my 
worry.” This mentality is dangerous. Each identified risk should be assigned (or shared) 
by mutual agreement of the owner, project manager, and the contractor or person having 
line responsibility for the work package or segment of the project. It is best to have the 
line person responsible approve the use of contingency reserves and monitor their rate 
of usage. If management reserves are required, the line person should play an active 
role in estimating additional costs and funds needed to complete the project. Having 
line personnel participate in the process focuses attention on the management reserves, 
control of their rate of usage, and early warning of potential risk events. If risk manage￾ment is not formalized, responsibility and responses to risk will be ignored.
The bottom line is that project managers and team members need to be vigilant in 
monitoring potential risks and should identify new land mines that could derail a project. 
Risk assessment has to be part of the working agenda of status meetings, and when new 
risks emerge they need to be analyzed and incorporated into the risk management process.
7.9 Change Control Management
A major element of the risk control process is change management. Not every detail 
of a project plan will materialize as expected. Coping with and controlling project 
changes present a formidable challenge for most project managers. Changes come 
from many sources, such as the project customer, owner, project manager, team mem￾bers, and risk events. Most changes easily fall into three categories:
1. Scope changes in the form of design or additions represent big changes—for exam￾ple, customer requests for a new feature or a redesign that will improve the product.
2. Implementation of contingency plans, when risk events occur, represents changes 
in baseline costs and schedules.
3. Improvement changes suggested by project team members represent another category.

control process.

Because change is inevitable, a well-defined change review and control process should 
be set up early in the project planning cycle.
Change management systems involve reporting, controlling, and recording 
changes to the project baseline. (Note: Some organizations consider change control 
systems part of configuration management.) In practice, most change management 
systems are designed to accomplish the following.
1. Identify proposed changes.
2. List expected effects of proposed change(s) on schedule and budget.
3. Review, evaluate, and approve or disapprove changes formally.
4. Negotiate and resolve conflicts of change, conditions, and cost.
5. Communicate changes to the parties affected.
6. Assign responsibility for implementing change.
7. Adjust the master schedule and budget.
8. Track all changes that are to be implemented.
As part of the project communication plan, stakeholders define up front the communi￾cation and decision-making process that will be used to evaluate and accept changes. 
The process can be captured in a flow diagram like the one in Figure 7.9. On small 
projects, this process may simply entail approval of a small group of stakeholders. 
On larger projects, more elaborate decision-making processes are established, with 
different processes being used for different kinds of change. For example, changes in 
performance requirements may require multiple sign-offs, including the project spon￾sor and client, while switching suppliers may be authorized by the project manager. 
Regardless of the nature of the project, the goal is to establish the process for intro￾ducing necessary changes in the project in a timely and effective manner. 
Of particular importance is assessing the impact of the change on the project. 
Often, solutions to immediate problems have adverse consequences on other aspects 
of a project. For example, self-driving software systems have been and will continue 
to be prototyped in order to identify anomalous driving scenarios/situations and to 
respond correctly to them so as to avoid accidents. It is important that the implica￾tions of changes are assessed by people with appropriate expertise and perspective. 
On construction projects, this is often the responsibility of the architecture firm, while 
“software architects” perform a similar function in software development efforts.
Organizations use change request forms and logs to track proposed changes. An 
example of a simplified change request form is depicted in Figure  7.10. Typically 
change request forms include a description of the change, the impact of not approv￾ing the change, the impact of the change on project scope/schedule/cost, and defined 
signature paths for review, as well as a tracking log number. 
An abridged version of a change request log for a construction project is presented 
in Figure 7.11. These logs are used to monitor change requests. They typically sum￾marize the status of all outstanding change requests and include such useful informa￾tion as the source and date of the change, document codes for related information, cost 
estimates, and the current status of the request.
Every approved change must be identified and integrated into the plan of record 
through changes in the project WBS and baseline schedule. The plan of record is the 
current official plan for the project in terms of scope, budget, and schedule. The plan 
of record serves as a change management benchmark for future change requests as 
well as the baseline for evaluating project progress.
If the change control system is not integrated with the WBS and baseline, project 
plans and control will soon self-destruct. Thus, one of the keys to a successful change

Clearly, change control is important and requires that someone or some group be 
responsible for approving changes, keeping the process updated, and communicating 
changes to the project team and relevant stakeholders. Project control depends heavily 
on keeping the change control process current. This historical record can be used for 
satisfying customer inquiries, identifying problems in post-project audits, and estimat￾ing future project costs.
Summary To put the processes discussed in this chapter in proper perspective, one should rec￾ognize that the essence of project management is risk management. Every technique 
in this book is a risk management technique. Each in its own way tries to prevent 
something bad from happening. Project selection systems try to reduce the likelihood 
that projects will not contribute to the mission of the firm. Project scope statements, 
among other things, are designed to avoid costly misunderstandings and reduce scope 
creep. Work breakdown structures reduce the likelihood that some vital part of the 
Final PDF to printerChapter 7 Managing Risk 245
lar60886_ch07_219-264.indd 245 10/14/23 11:43 am
project will be omitted or that the budget estimates are unrealistic. Team building 
reduces the likelihood of dysfunctional conflict and breakdowns in coordination. All 
of the techniques try to increase stakeholder satisfaction and the chances of project 
success.
From this perspective, managers engage in risk management activities to com￾pensate for the uncertainty inherent in project management and that things never go 
according to plan. Risk management is proactive, not reactive. It reduces the number 
of surprises and prepares people for the unexpected.
Although many managers believe that in the final analysis, risk assessment and 
contingency depend on subjective judgment, some standard methods for identifying, 
assessing, and responding to risks should be included in all projects. The very process 
of identifying project risks forces some discipline at all levels of project management 
and improves project performance.
Contingency plans increase the chance that the project can be completed on time 
and within budget. Contingency plans can be simple work arounds or elaborate, 
detailed plans. Responsibility for risks should be clearly identified and documented. It 
is desirable and prudent to keep a reserve as a hedge against project risks. Contingency 
reserves are linked to the WBS and should be communicated to the project team. 
Use of contingency reserves should be closely monitored, controlled, and reviewed 
throughout the project life cycle. Control of management reserves should remain with 
the owner, project manager, and line person responsible.
Experience clearly indicates that using a formal, structured process to handle pos￾sible foreseen and unforeseen project risk events minimizes surprises, costs, delays, 
stress, and misunderstandings. Risk management is an iterative process that occurs 
throughout the lifespan of the project. When risk events occur or changes are neces￾sary, using an effective change control process to quickly approve and record changes 
will facilitate measuring performance against schedule and cost. Ultimately, success￾ful risk management requires a culture in which threats are embraced, not denied, and 
problems are identified, not hidden.

SNAPSHOT 
FROM PRACTICE
1. Gather a small team of students. Think of a project most students would under￾stand; the kinds of tasks involved should also be familiar. Identify and assess 
major and minor risks inherent in the project. Decide on a response type. Develop 
a contingency plan for two to four identified risks. Estimate costs. Assign contin￾gency reserves. How much reserve would your team estimate for the whole pro￾ject? Justify your choices and estimates.
2. You have been assigned to a project risk team of five members. Because this is the 
first time your organization has formally set up a risk team for a project, it is hoped 
that your team will develop a process that can be used on all future projects. Your first 
team meeting is next Monday morning. Each team member has been asked to prepare 
for the meeting by developing, in as much detail as possible, an outline that describes 
how you believe the team should proceed in handling project risks. Each of the team 
members will hand out their proposed outline at the beginning of the meeting. Your 
outline should include but not be limited to the following information:
a. Team objectives.
b. Process for handling risk events.
c. Team activities.
d. Team outputs.
3. Search the Web using the key words “best practices, project management.” What 
did you find? How might this information be useful to a project manager?

Case 7.5
Sustaining Project Risk Management during 
Implementation
BACKGROUND
Bill (senior VP of product development): Carlos [project manager], we have to talk. 
I am concerned about the way we manage project risk here at Futuronics. I just came 
from an international “Future Mote Devices” meeting at UC Berkeley. [Note: A mote
is a very small (e.g., 2- to 3-mm-square), wireless sensing pod that can be placed on 
land or in water to measure and communicate data.] The project management ses￾sions receiving most attention addressed risk in product development projects. They 
described our management of project risk to the letter—failure to sustain risk man￾agement after the project gets rolling. It seems someone has to get burned before risk 
management is taken seriously.
Much to my surprise, almost all the project managers there admitted their firms 
have a problem sustaining team members’ interest in managing risk after the project is 
on its way. The old saying “If you don’t manage risk, you pay the price later” generated 
Final PDF to printer254 Chapter 7 Managing Risk
lar60886_ch07_219-264.indd 254 10/14/23 11:43 am
horror stories from a few who paid the price. We spent some time brainstorming ways 
to handle the problem at the project level, but there were very few concrete sugges￾tions. The meeting gave me a wake-up call. Carlos, we need to tackle this problem or 
some new or known risk event could put us both out of a job. The similarities between 
their horror stories and some of our past mistakes are scary.
Since here at Futuronics we only develop new products that are at least seven years 
beyond anything on the market, the level of both “known risk events and unknown risk” 
is far higher than in most other organizations. Managing project risk is important to every 
project, but here at Futuronics every new product project is loaded with risks. Carlos, 
I’m willing to work with you to improve our management of project risk at Futuronics.
Carlos: Bill, I am aware of the problem. The PMI roundtables I attend also talk about 
the difficulty of keeping teams and other stakeholders willing to revisit risk once the 
project is on its way. [PMI roundtables are monthly meetings of practicing PMs across 
industries designed to address project management problems.] I also heard war stories 
at a recent project management roundtable meeting. I have some notes from the meet￾ing right here.
It all started with the leader’s question: “How many project managers actually man￾age risk over the complete project life cycle?” 
PM 1: We all work through the risk management process well before the project 
begins. We have the process template of risk identification, assessment, response, 
control, risk register, and contingency down pat. We just don’t follow through after 
the project begins. I think interest dies. Have you ever tried to get project stakehold￾ers to come to a risk meeting when the project is moving relatively well?
PM 2: A recent e-mail from one of our stakeholders said, “We’ll deal with it [risk] 
when it happens.”
PM 3: I agree. Interest seems to move from future oriented to reactionary. Also, 
risk management seems to degenerate into issue (concerns and problems) manage￾ment versus real risk management.
PM 4: I ask team members, “What is the risk of not managing risk over the life 
of the project?” Sometimes this question nudges a few to respond positively, espe￾cially if risks have changed or new ones are perceived. I use a failed project where 
a solid risk management process would have avoided the project failure. I explain 
all of the risk management processes that would have helped to improve the risk 
elements—risk identification, triggers, responsibility, transfer, accept, etc.
PM 5: Risk is not a line item in the budget or schedule. Maybe it is in the manage￾ment reserve to cover “unknowns of unknowns.” I have to watch that management 
doesn’t try to squeeze out the budget for something else.
Carlos continued to share with his boss that there were many more comments, but very 
few gave much guidance. Carlos then shared his idea:
Carlos: Colette is our best trainer, especially in transition management, and she would 
be a great choice for following through on this problem. Her training classes on up￾front risk management are excellent. Should we ask her to present a session?
Bill: You are right, Carlos; Colette is ideal. She is smart and a great team motivator. 
Ask her, but give her some kind of direction for focus.
A few days later, Carlos sent out a memo:
Colette, this is to follow up on our lunch conversation yesterday discussing sustain￾ing risk management after the project is on its way. Given the nature of our futuristic

company, we should stress the point that our product development projects carry many 
more inherent risks than do traditional projects. I suggest the training classes should 
drill down on concrete actions and policies that will encourage the interest of team 
members and other project stakeholders in sustaining risk management practices dur￾ing project execution.
Colette, we appreciate your taking on this project. When you have developed your 
training session, please give me a copy so I can schedule and support your efforts.
Regards, Carlos
CHALLENGE
Divide the class into teams of three or more participants.
Colette needs your help to develop her training program. You may wish to consider 
the following questions to initiate ideas.
∙ Why do project stakeholders lose interest in project risk after the project is under way?
∙ What are the dangers of not keeping on top of risk management during 
implementation?
∙ What kind of business is Futuronics in?
Brainstorm specific actions that will encourage project stakeholders to continue to 
scan and track the project environment for risk events. Suggest three concrete actions 
or scenarios that will encourage project stakeholders to change their behavior and truly 
support risk management while projects are being implemented. The following outline 
headings may be helpful in developing possible actions that would improve/enhance 
stakeholder support.
∙ Improving the risk management process
∙ Organization actions
∙ Motivating participation

PERT and PERT Simulation
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After reading this appendix, you should be able to
A7-1 Calculate basic PERT simulation projections.
PERT—PROGRAM EVALUATION AND REVIEW TECHNIQUE
In 1958, the Special Office of the Navy and the Booze, Allen, and Hamilton consult￾ing firm developed PERT (program evaluation and review technique) to schedule the 
more than 3,300 contractors of the Polaris submarine project and to cover uncertainty 
of activity time estimates.
PERT is almost identical to the critical path method (CPM) technique except 
it assumes each activity duration has a range that follows a statistical distribution.

simulation projections.

lar60886_ch07_219-264.indd 256 10/14/23 11:43 am
PERT uses three time estimates for each activity. Basically this means each activity 
duration can range from an optimistic time to a pessimistic time, and a weighted aver￾age can be computed for each activity. Because project activities usually represent 
work, and because work tends to stay behind once it gets behind, the PERT developers 
chose an approximation of the beta distribution to represent activity durations. This 
distribution is known to be flexible and can accommodate empirical data that do not 
follow a normal distribution. The activity durations can be skewed more toward the 
high or low end of the data range. Figure A7.1A depicts a beta distribution for activity 
durations that is skewed toward the right and is representative of work that tends to 
stay late once it is behind. The distribution for the project duration is represented by 
a normal (symmetrical) distribution shown in Figure A7.1B. The project distribution 
represents the sum of the weighted averages of the activities on the critical path(s). 
Knowing the weighted average and variances for each activity allows the project 
planner to compute the probability of meeting different project durations. Follow the 
steps described in the hypothetical example given next. (The jargon is difficult for 
those not familiar with statistics, but the process is relatively simple after working 
through a couple of examples.)
The weighted average activity time is computed by the following formula:
 t
e = a + 4m + b ________
6 (7.1)
where
t
e
 = weighted average activity time
a = optimistic activity time (1 chance in 100 of completing the activity 
earlier under normal conditions)
b = pessimistic activity time (1 chance in 100 of completing the 
activity later under normal conditions)
m = most likely activity time
When the three time estimates have been specified, this equation is used to compute 
the weighted average duration for each activity. The average (deterministic) value is 
placed on the project network as in the CPM method and the early, late, slack, and 
project completion times are computed as they are in the CPM method.
The variability in the activity time estimates is approximated by the following 
equations: Equation 7.2 represents the standard deviation for the activity. Equation 7.3

represents the standard deviation for the project. Note the standard deviation of the 
activity is squared in Equation 7.3; this is also called variance. This summation 
includes only activities on the critical path(s) or path being reviewed.

Finally, the average project duration (TE) is the summation of all the average 
activity times along the critical path (summation of t
e
), and it follows a normal 
distribution.
Knowing the average project duration and the variances of activities allows the 
probability of completing the project (or segment of the project) by a specific time to 
be computed using standard statistical tables. The following equation (Equation 7.4) 
is used to compute the “Z” value found in statistical tables (Z = number of standard 
deviations from the mean), which in turn tells the probability of completing the project 
in the time specified.

A HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE USING PERT
The activity times and variances are given in Table A7.1. The project network is pre￾sented in Figure A7.2. This figure shows the project network as AOA and AON. The 
AON network is presented as a reminder that PERT can use AON networks as well 
as AOA. 
The expected project duration (TE) is 64 time units; the critical path is 1-2-3-5-6 
in AOA network. In AON, the critical path is A-B-D-F. With this information, the 
probability of completing the project by a specific date can easily be computed using 
standard statistical methods. For example, what is the probability the project will be 
completed before a scheduled time (TS
) of 67? The normal curve for the project would 
appear as shown in Figure A7.3.

Reading from Table A7.2, a Z value of +0.5 gives a probability of 0.69, which is 
interpreted to mean there is a 69 percent chance of completing the project on or before 
67 time units. The probability of 0.69 for a Z value of +0.5 can be found using the 
linear interpolation method.
Conversely, the probability of completing the project by time period 60 is computed 
as follows:
 
Z = 60 − 64 __________

√
___
36

From Table A7.2, a Z value of −0.67 gives an approximate probability of 0.25, which 
is interpreted to mean there is about a 25 percent chance of completing the project on 
or before 60 time units. Note that this same type of calculation can be made for any 
path or segment of a path in the network.
When such probabilities are available to management, trade-off decisions can be 
made to accept or reduce the risk associated with a particular project duration. For 
example, if the project manager wishes to improve the chances of completing the 
project by 64 time units, at least two choices are available. First, management can 
spend money upfront to change conditions that will reduce the duration of one or more 
activities on the critical path. A more prudent, second alternative would be to allocate 
money to a contingency fund and wait to see how the project is progressing as it is 
implemented.

MANAGERIAL REPORT
Beth and other broker partners have a policy of passing their plan through a project review 
committee of colleagues. This committee traditionally checks that all details are covered, 
times are realistic, and resources are available. Beth wishes you to develop a report that pres￾ents a planned schedule and expected project completion time in workdays. Include a project 
network in your report. The average duration for a sourcing capital project is 70 workdays. 
IC partners have agreed it is good business to set up projects with a 95 percent chance of 
attaining the plan. How does this project stack up with the average project? What would the 
average have to be to ensure a 95 percent chance of completing the project in 70 workdays?

Careful planning was needed because AET operates in the highly competitive 
petroleum industry. AET is one of five national software companies that provide an 
accounting and business management package for oil jobbers and gasoline distribu￾tors. A few years ago, AET jumped into the “application service provider” world. 
Their large data center provides clients with remote access to AET’s complete suite of 
application software systems. Traditionally one of AET’s primary competitive advan￾tages has been the company’s trademark IT reliability. Due to the complexity of this 
project, the Executive Committee insisted that preliminary analysis of the anticipated 
completion date be conducted.
Brian compiled the following information, in preparation for some PERT analysis:
1. Based on these estimates and the resultant expected project duration of 69 days, 
the Executive Committee wants to know the probability of completing the project 
before a scheduled time (TS
) of 68 days.
2. The significance of this project has the Executive Committee very concerned. The 
committee has decided that more analysis of the duration of each activity is needed. 
Prior to conducting that effort, they asked Brian to calculate what the expected 
project duration would have to be to ensure a 93 percent chance of completion 
within 68 days.
ADVANTAGE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY (AET)—ACCOUNTS 
PAYABLE SYSTEM
The AET Sales Department has been concerned about a new start-up company that is 
about to release an accounts payable system. Their investigation indicates that this new 
package will provide features that will seriously compete with AET’s current accounts 
payable system and in some cases exceed what AET offers.
Tom Wright, senior applications developer at AET, has been given the responsibil￾ity of analyzing, designing, developing, and delivering a new accounts payable system 
(A/P) for AET customers.
Complicating the issue is the concern of the Sales Department about AET’s recent 
inability to meet promised delivery dates. They have convinced CEO (Larry Martain) 
that a significant marketing effort will have to be expended to convince the clients 
they should wait for the AET product rather than jump to a package provided by a new 
entry to the petroleum software business. Companion to this effort is the importance 
of the performance of the software development group.
Consequently, Tom has decided to take the following action: tighten up the estimat￾ing effort by his developers, incorporate some new estimating procedures, and use 
some PERT techniques to generate probabilities associated with his delivery dates.
Tom’s planning team made a first-cut at the set of activities and associated durations:
3. Based on these estimates and the critical path, the project duration is estimated 
at 149 days. But an AET salesperson in the Southeast Region has discovered that 
the competing A/P package (with significant improvements) is scheduled for deliv￾ery in approximately 145 days. The sales force is very anxious to beat that delivery 
time. The Executive Committee asks Tom for an estimated probability of reducing 
his expected project duration by 2 days.
4. The Executive Committee is advised by Tom that after all the estimating was com￾pleted, he determined that one of his two critical systems analysts might have to 
move out of the area for family reasons. Tom is still very confident that with some 
staff rearrangements, assistance from a subcontractor, and some “hands-on” activi￾ties on his part he can still meet the original delivery date, based on 149 days.

This news is very disconcerting to the committee and the sales staff. At this 
point, the committee decides that based on the most recent delivery performance of 
AET, a modified, comfortable delivery date should be communicated to AET 
clients—one that Tom and his staff are very likely to meet. Consequently, Tom is 
asked to calculate what the expected project duration would have to be to ensure a 
98 percent chance of completion within 160 days—a “published, drop-dead date” 
that can be communicated to the clients.

Project network times are not a schedule until resources have been assigned. 
Cost estimates are not a budget until they have been time-phased.
—Clifford F. Gray, Project Management educator.
We have consistently stressed that up-front planning results in big payoffs on predict￾able projects. For those who have diligently worked through the earlier planning pro￾cesses chapters, you are nearly ready to launch your project. This chapter completes 
the final two planning tasks that become the master plan for your project—resource 
and cost scheduling (see Figure 8.1). This process uses the resource schedule to assign 
time-phased costs that provide the project budget baseline. Given this time-phased 
baseline, comparisons can be made with actual and planned schedule and costs. 
This chapter first discusses the process for developing the project resource schedule. 
This resource schedule will be used to assign the time-phased budgeted values to cre￾ate a project budget baseline.
There are always more project proposals than there are available resources. The 
priority system needs to select projects that best contribute to the organization’s objec￾tives, within the constraints of the resources available. If all projects and their respec￾tive resources are computer scheduled, the feasibility and impact of adding a new

project to those in process can be quickly assessed. With this information the project 
priority team will add a new project only if resources are available. This chapter exam￾ines methods of scheduling resources so the team can make realistic judgments of 
resource availability and project durations. The project manager uses the same sched￾ule for implementing the project. If changes occur during project implementation, the 
computer schedule is easily updated and the effects easily assessed.
8.1 Overview of the Resource Scheduling Problem
After staff and other resources were assigned to his/her project, a project manager 
listed the following questions that still needed to be addressed:
∙ Will the assigned labor and/or equipment be adequate and available to deal with my 
project?
∙ Will outside contractors have to be used?
∙ Do unforeseen resource dependencies exist? Is there a new critical path?
∙ How much flexibility do I have in using resources?
∙ Is the original deadline realistic?
Clearly this project manager has a good understanding of the problems he/she is fac￾ing. Any project scheduling system should facilitate finding quick, easy answers to 
these questions.
The planned network and activity project duration times found in previous chapters 
did not take into account resource usage and availability. The time estimates for the 
work packages and network times were made independently with the implicit assump￾tion that resources would be available. This may or may not be the case.
If resources are adequate but the demand varies widely over the life of the project, it 
may be desirable to even out resource demand by delaying noncritical activities (using 
slack) to lower peak demand and, thus, increase resource utilization. This process is 
called resource smoothing.
On the other hand, if resources are not adequate to meet peak demands, the late start 
of some activities must be delayed, and the duration of the project may be increased. 
This process is called resource-constrained scheduling.
The consequences of failing to schedule limited resources are costly and project 
delays usually manifest themselves midway in the project when quick corrective action 
is difficult. An additional consequence of failing to schedule resources is ignoring the 
peaks and valleys of resource usage over the duration of the project. Because project 
resources are usually overcommitted and because resources seldom line up by avail￾ability and need, procedures are needed to deal with these problems. This chapter 
addresses methods available to project managers for dealing with resource utilization 
and availability through resource leveling and resource-constrained scheduling.
Up to now the start and sequence of activities have been based solely on technical 
or logical considerations. For example, assume you are planning a wedding recep￾tion that includes four activities—(1) plan, (2) hire band, (3) decorate hall, and (4) 
purchase refreshments. Each activity takes one day. Activities 2, 3, and 4 could be 
done in parallel by different people. There is no technical reason or dependency of 
one on another (see Figure 8.2A). However, if one person must perform all activities, 
the resource constraint requires that the activities be performed in sequence or series. 
Clearly the consequence is a delay of these activities and a very different set of net￾work relationships (see Figure 8.2B). Note that the resource dependency takes priority

over the technological dependency but does not violate the technological dependency;
that is, hire, decorate, and purchase may now have to take place in sequence rather 
than concurrently, but they must all be completed before the reception can take place. 
One may ask, “Why not factor resource availability along with technical depen￾dency when creating the original network?” First, resource availability may not be 
known until the initial schedule is completed. Second, even if resources are known, 
one could not assess the impact of resources unless a resource neutral schedule were 
created. For example, one would never know that the wedding could be planned in 
three days instead of five if three people were available instead of the assumed one. 
When the premise behind this simple example is applied to other, more elaborate proj￾ects, the implications can be significant.
The interrelationships and interactions among time and resource constraints are 
complex for even small project networks. Some effort to examine these interactions 
before the project begins frequently uncovers surprising problems. Project managers 
who do not consider resource availability in moderately complex projects usually learn 
of the problem when it is too late to correct. A deficit of resources can significantly 
alter project dependency relationships, completion dates, and project costs. Project 
managers must be careful to schedule resources to ensure availability in the right quan￾tities and at the right time. Fortunately, there are computer software programs that can 
identify resource problems during the early project planning phase when corrective 
changes can be considered. These programs only require activity resource needs and 
availability information to schedule resources.
See Snapshot from Practice 8.1: Working in Tight Places for a third constraint that 
impinges on project schedules.
8.2 Types of Resource Constraints
Resources are people, equipment, and material that can be drawn on to accomplish 
something. In projects the availability or unavailability of resources will often influ￾ence the way projects are managed.
1. People. This is the most obvious and important project resource. Human 
resources are usually classified by the skills they bring to the project—for example,

programmer, mechanical engineer, welder, inspector, marketing director, and super￾visor. In rare cases some skills are interchangeable, but usually with a loss of pro￾ductivity. The many differing skills of human resources add to the complexity of 
scheduling projects.
2. Materials. Project materials cover a large spectrum—for example, chemicals 
for a scientific project, concrete for a road project and, survey data for a marketing 
project. Material availability and shortages have been blamed for the delay of many 
projects. When it is known that a lack of availability of materials is important and 
probable, materials should be included in the project network plan and schedule. For 
example, delivery and placement of an oil rig tower in a Siberian oil field has a very 
small time window during one summer month. Any delivery delay means a one-year, 
costly delay. Another example in which material is the major resource scheduled was 
the resurfacing and replacement of some structures on the Golden Gate Bridge in San 
Francisco. Work on the project was limited to the hours between midnight and 5:00 
a.m., with a penalty of $1,000 per minute for any work taking place after 5:00 a.m. 
Scheduling the arrival of replacement structures was an extremely important part of 
managing the five-hour work-time window of the project. Scheduling materials has 
also become important in developing products where time-to-market can result in loss 
of market share.
3. Equipment. Equipment is usually presented by type, size, and quantity. In some 
cases, equipment can be interchanged to improve schedules, but this is not typical. 
Equipment is often overlooked as a constraint. The most common oversight is to 
assume the resource pool is more than adequate for the project. For example, if a 
project needs one earthmoving tractor six months from now and the organization owns 
four, it is common to assume the resource will not delay the pending project. However, 
when the earthmoving tractor is due on-site in six months, all four machines in the 
pool might be occupied on other projects. In multiproject environments it is prudent to 
In rare situations, physical factors 
cause activities that would normally 
occur in parallel to be constrained 
by contractual or environmental 
conditions. For example, in theory 
the renovation of a sailboat compartment might 
involve four or five tasks that can be done inde￾pendently. However, since space allows only one 
person to work at one time, all tasks have to be 
performed sequentially. Likewise, on a mining proj￾ect it may be physically possible for only two min￾ers to work in a shaft at a time. Another example is 
the erection of a communication tower and nearby 
groundwork. For safety considerations, the contract 
prohibits groundwork within 2,000 feet of the tower 
construction.

use a common resource pool for all projects. This approach forces a check of resource 
availability across all projects and reserves the equipment for specific project needs in 
the future. Recognition of equipment constraints before the project begins can avoid 
high crashing or delay costs.
8.3 Classification of a Scheduling Problem
Most of the scheduling methods available today require the project manager to classify 
the project as either time constrained or resource constrained. Project managers need 
to consult their priority matrix (see Figure 4.2) to determine which case fits their proj￾ect. One simple test is to ask, “If the critical path is delayed, will resources be added to 
get back on schedule?” If the answer is yes, assume the project is time constrained; if 
no, assume the project is resource constrained.
A time-constrained project is one that must be completed by an imposed date. If 
required, resources can be added to ensure the project is completed by a specific date. 
Although time is the critical factor, resource usage should be no more than is neces￾sary and sufficient.
A resource-constrained project is one that assumes the level of resources avail￾able cannot be exceeded. If the resources are inadequate, it will be acceptable to delay 
the project, but as little as possible.
In scheduling terms, time constrained means time (project duration) is fixed and 
resources are flexible, while resource constrained means resources are fixed and time 
is flexible. Methods for scheduling these projects are presented in the next section.
8.4 Resource Allocation Methods
Assumptions
Ease of demonstrating the allocation methods available requires some limiting 
assumptions to keep attention on the heart of the problem. The rest of the chap￾ter depends entirely on the assumptions noted here. First, splitting activities will 
not be allowed. Splitting refers to interrupting work on one task and assigning the 
resources to work on a different task for a period of time, then reassigning them to 
work on the original task. No splitting means that once an activity is placed in the 
schedule, assume it will be worked on continuously until it is finished. Second, the 
level of resources used for an activity cannot be changed. These limiting assump￾tions do not exist in practice but simplify learning. It is easy for new project manag￾ers to deal with the reality of splitting activities and changing the level of resources 
when they meet them on the job.
Time-Constrained Projects: Smoothing Resource Demand
Scheduling time-constrained projects focuses on resource utilization. When demand 
for a specific resource type is erratic, it is difficult to manage, and utilization may be 
very poor. Practitioners have attacked the utilization problem using resource leveling 
techniques that balance demand for a resource. Basically all leveling techniques delay 
noncritical activities by using positive slack to reduce peak demand and fill in the 
valleys for the resources. An example will demonstrate the basic procedure for a time￾constrained project (see Figure 8.3).

For the purpose of demonstration, the Botanical Garden project uses only one 
resource (backhoes); all backhoes are interchangeable. The top bar chart shows the 
activities on a timescale. The dependencies are shown with the vertical connecting 
arrows. The horizontal arrows following activities represent activity slack (for exam￾ple, irrigation requires six time units to complete and has six time units of slack). 
The number of backhoes (Bh) needed for each task is shown in the shaded activity 
duration block (rectangle). After the land has been sacrificed and the plan laid out, 
work can begin on the walkways, irrigation, and fencing and retaining walls simulta￾neously. The middle chart shows the resource profile for the backhoes. For periods 4 
through 10, four backhoes are needed.

Because this project is declared time constrained, the goal will be to reduce 
the peak requirement for the resource and thereby increase the utilization of the 
resource. A quick examination of the ES (early start) resource load chart suggests 
only two activities have slack that can be used to reduce the peak—fence and walls 
provide the best choice for smoothing the resource needs. Another choice could be 
irrigation, but it would result in an up-and-down resource profile. The choice will 
probably center on the activity that is perceived as having the least risk of being late. 
The smoothed resource loading chart (bottom chart) shows the results of delaying the 
fence and walls activity. Note the differences in the resource profiles. The important 
point is that the resources needed over the life of the project have been reduced from 
four to three (25 percent). In addition, the profile has been smoothed, which should be 
easier to manage.
The Botanical Garden project schedule reached the three goals of smoothing:
∙ The peak of demand for the resource was reduced.
∙ The number of resources over the life of the project was reduced.
∙ The fluctuations in resource demand were minimized.
Smoothing improves the utilization of resources. Backhoes are not easily moved from 
location to location. There are costs associated with changing the level of resources 
needed. The same analogy applies to the movement of people back and forth among 
projects. It is well known that people are more efficient if they can focus their effort on 
one project rather than multitasking their time among, say, three projects.
The downside of leveling is a loss of flexibility that occurs from reducing slack. 
The risk of activities delaying the project also increases because slack reduction can 
create more critical activities and/or near-critical activities. Pushing leveling too far 
for a perfectly level resource profile is risky. Every activity then becomes critical.
The Botanical Garden example gives a sense of the time-constrained problem and 
the smoothing approach. However, in practice the magnitude of the problem is very 
complex for even small projects. Manual solutions are not practical. Fortunately, 
the software packages available today have very good routines for leveling proj￾ect resources. Typically they use activities that have the most slack to level project 
resources. The rationale is that those activities with the most slack pose the least risk. 
Although this is generally true, other risk factors such as reduction of flexibility to 
use reassigned resources on other activities and the nature of the activity (easy, com￾plex) are not addressed using such a simple rationale. It is easy to experiment with 
many alternatives to find the one that best fits your project and minimizes the risk of 
delaying the project.
Resource-Constrained Projects
When the number of people and/or equipment is not adequate to meet peak demand 
requirements and it is impossible to obtain more, the project manager faces a resource￾constrained problem. Something has to give. The trick is to prioritize and allocate 
resources to minimize project delay without exceeding the resource limit or altering 
the technical network relationships.
The resource scheduling problem is a large, combinatorial one. This means even 
a modest-sized project network with only a few resource types might have several 
thousand feasible solutions. A few researchers have demonstrated optimum math￾ematical solutions to the resource allocation problem but only for small networks 
and very few resource types (Arrow & Hurowicz, 2006; Talbot & Patterson, 1979; 
LO 8-4

Woodworth & Shanahan, 1988). The massive data requirements for larger problems 
make pure mathematical solutions (e.g., linear programming) impractical. An alter￾native approach to the problem has been the use of heuristics (rules of thumb) to 
solve large, combinatorial problems. These practical decision or priority rules have 
been in place for many years.
Heuristics do not always yield an optimal schedule, but they are very capable of 
yielding a “good” schedule for very complex networks with many types of resources. 
The efficiency of different rules and combinations of rules has been well documented 
(Davis & Patterson, 1975; Fendly, 1968). However, because each project is unique, it 
is wise to test several sets of heuristics on a network to determine the priority alloca￾tion rules that minimize project delay. The computer software available today makes 
it very easy for the project manager to create a good resource schedule for the project. 
A simple example of the heuristic approach is illustrated here.
Heuristics allocate resources to activities to minimize project delay; that is, heuris￾tics prioritize which activities are allocated resources and which activities are delayed 
when resources are not adequate.
The parallel method is the most widely used approach to apply heuristics, which 
have been found to consistently minimize project delay over a large variety of projects. 
The parallel method is an iterative process that starts from the beginning of project 
time and, when the resources needed exceed the resources available, retains activities 
first by the priority rules:
1. Minimum slack.
2. Smallest duration.
3. Lowest activity identification number.
Those not able to be scheduled without delaying others are pushed out further in 
time. However, do not attempt to move activities that have already started. When 
considering activities not to delay, consider the resources each activity uses. In any 
period when two or more activities require the same resource, the priority rules 
are applied. For example, if in period 5 three activities are eligible to start (i.e., 
have the same ES) and require the same resource, the first activity placed in the 
schedule would be the activity with the least slack (rule 1). However, if all activi￾ties have the same slack, the next rule would be invoked (rule 2), and the activity 
with the smallest duration would be placed in the schedule first. In very rare cases, 
when all eligible activities have the same slack and the same duration, the tie is 
broken by the lowest activity identification number (rule 3), since each activity has 
a unique ID number.
When a resource limit has been reached, the early start (ES) for succeeding activi￾ties not yet in the schedule will be delayed (and all successor activities not having free 
slack) and their slack reduced. In subsequent periods the procedure is repeated until 
the project is scheduled. The procedure is demonstrated next; see Figure 8.4. The 
shaded areas in the resource loading chart represent the “scheduling interval” of the 
time-constrained schedule (ES through LF). You can schedule the resource anyplace 
within the interval and not delay the project. Scheduling the activity beyond the LF 
will delay the project. 
The programmers are limited to three. Follow the actions described in Figures 8.4 
and 8.5. Note how the limit of three programmers starts to delay the project. 
Observe how it is necessary to update each period to reflect changes in activity 
early start and slack times so the heuristics can reflect changing priorities. When using

6 slack units. This occurs because only three programmers are available, and they are 
needed to satisfy the resource requirements of activities 2 and 5. Note that the number 
of critical activities (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7) has increased from four to six.
This small example demonstrates the scenario of scheduling resources in real proj￾ects and the resulting increase in the risk of being late. In practice this is not a trivial 
problem! Managers who fail to schedule resources usually encounter this scheduling 
risk when it is too late to work around the problem, resulting in a project delay.
Since manually using the parallel method is impractical on real-world projects 
because of size, project managers will depend on software programs to schedule proj￾ect resources.
8.5 Computer Demonstration of Resource-Constrained Scheduling
Fortunately, project management software is capable of assessing and resolving com￾plicated resource-constrained schedules using heuristics similar to those described in 
the previous section. We will use the EMR project to demonstrate how this is done 
using MS Project. It is important to note that the software is not “managing” the proj￾ect. The software is simply a tool the project manager uses to view the project from 
different perspectives and conditions. See Snapshot from Practice 8.2: Assessing 
Resource Allocation for more tips on assessing resource problems.
EMR is the name given to a hand-held electronic medical reference guide that 
is being developed to be used by emergency medical technicians and paramedics. 
LO 8-5
Understand how project 
management software 
creates resource￾constrained schedules.
One of the strengths of project man￾agement software is the ability to 
identify and provide options for resolv￾ing resource allocation problems. One 
project manager who uses MS Project 
shared the following checklist for dealing with resource 
conflicts after preliminary assignment of resources.
1. Assess whether you have overallocation problems 
(see Red in the resource sheet view).
2. Identify where and when conflicts occur by examin￾ing the resource usage view.
3. Resolve the problem by
a. Replacing overallocated resources with appro￾priate resources that are available. Then ask if 
this solves the problem.
If not:
b. Use the leveling tool and choose the level within 
slack option.
i. Does this solve the problem? (Are resources 
still overallocated?)
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 8.2 Assessing Resource Allocation
ii. Check the sensitivity of the network and ask 
if this is acceptable.
If not:
c. Consider splitting tasks.
i. Make sure to readjust task durations to take 
into account additional start-up and shut￾down time.
4. If 3 does not work, then either
a. Use level tool default option and ask if you can 
live with the new completion date.
If not:
b. Negotiate for additional resources to complete 
the project. If not possible:
c. Consider reducing project scope to meet 
deadline.
While this checklist makes specific references to MS 
Project, the same steps can be used with most project 
management software.

Figure 8.6 contains a time-limited network for the design phase of the project. For 
the purpose of this example, we assume that only design engineers are required for 
the tasks and that the design engineers are interchangeable. The number of engineers 
required to perform each task is noted in the network, where 500 percent means five 
design engineers are needed for the activity. For example, activity 5, feature specs, 
requires four design engineers (400 percent). 
The project begins January 1 and ends February 14, a duration of 45 workdays. 
The calendar for the project has been set up to work seven days a week so the reader 
can trace and more easily see the results and impacts of resources—similar to manual 
solutions present in chapter exercises. The time-limited (constrained) bar chart for the 
project is shown in Figure 8.7. This bar chart incorporates the same information used 
to develop the project network but presents the project in the form of a bar chart along 
a timeline. 
Finally, a resource usage chart is presented for a segment of the project—January 
15 to January 23; see Figure 8.8A. Observe that the time-limited project requires 21 
design engineers on January 18 and 19 (168 hrs/8 hrs per engineer = 21 engineers). 
This segment represents the peak requirement for design engineers for the project. 
However, due to the shortage of design engineers and commitments to other projects, 
only 8 engineers can be assigned to the project. This creates overallocation problems, 
more clearly detailed in Figure 8.8B, which is a resource loading chart for design engi￾neers. Notice that the peak is 21 engineers and the limit of 8 engineers is shown by the 
gray shaded area. 
To resolve this problem we use the “leveling” tool within the software and first 
try to solve the problem by leveling only within slack. This solution would preserve 
the original finish date. However, as expected, this does not solve all of the allocation 
problems. The next option is to allow the software to apply scheduling heuristics and 
level outside of slack. The new schedule is contained in the revised, resource-limited 
network chart presented in Figure 8.9. The resource-limited project network indicates 
the project duration has now been extended to 2/26, or 57 workdays (versus 45 days 
time limited). The critical path is now 2, 3, 9, 13. 
Figure 8.10 presents the project bar chart and the results of leveling the project 
schedule to reflect the availability of only eight design engineers. The application of 
the heuristics can be seen in the scheduling of the internal, external, and feature speci￾fication activities. All three activities were originally scheduled to start immediately 
after activity 1, architectural decisions. 
This is impossible, since the three activities collectively require 13 engineers. The 
software chooses to schedule activity 5 first because this activity is on the original 
critical path and has zero slack (heuristic rule # 1). Next, and concurrently, activity 4 
is chosen over activity 3 because activity 4 has a shorter duration (heuristic rule # 2); 
internal specs, activity 3, is delayed due to the limitation of Eight design engineers. 
Notice that the original critical path no longer applies because of the resource depen￾dencies created by having only eight design engineers. See Figure 8.6 for the original 
planned critical path.
Compare the bar chart in Figure 8.10 with the time-limited bar chart in Figure 8.7. 
For example, note the different start dates for activity 8 (screen). In the time￾limited plan (Figure 8.7), the start date for activity 8 is 1/18, while the start date in the 
resource-limited schedule (Figure 8.10) is 2/16, almost a month later!

While resource bar graphs are commonly used to illustrate overallocation problems, 
we prefer to view resource usage tables like the one presented in Figure 8.8A. This 
table tells you when you have an overallocation problem and identifies activities that 
are causing the overallocation.
The Impacts of Resource-Constrained Scheduling
Like leveling schedules, the limited resource schedule usually reduces slack, reduces 
flexibility by using slack to ensure delay is minimized, and increases the number of 
critical and near-critical activities. Scheduling complexity is increased because 
resource constraints are added to technical constraints; start times may now have two 
constraints. The traditional critical path concept of sequential activities from the start 
to the end of the project is no longer meaningful. The resource constraints can break 
the sequence and leave the network with a set of disjointed critical activities.1

 See the appendix at the end of this chapter for more on how resource constraints affect project schedule.

Conversely, parallel activities can become sequential. Activities with slack on a time￾constrained network can change from critical to noncritical.
8.6 Splitting Activities
Splitting tasks is a scheduling technique used to get a better project schedule and/or to 
increase resource utilization. A planner splits the continuous work included in an activ￾ity by interrupting the work and sending the resource to another activity for a period 
of time and then having the resource resume work on the original activity. Splitting 
can be a useful tool if the work involved does not include large start-up or shutdown 
costs—for example, moving equipment from one activity location to another. Con￾versely, painting a house involves significant set-up and clean-up work.
One of the most common errors is to interrupt “people work,” where there are high 
conceptual start-up and shutdown costs. For example, having a bridge designer take 
time off to work on the design problem of another project may cause this individual to 
lose four days shifting conceptual gears in and out of two activities. The cost may be 
hidden, but it is real. Figure 8.11 depicts the nature of the splitting problem. The origi￾nal activity has been split into three separate activities: A, B, and C. The shutdown and 
start-up times lengthen the time for the original activity. One study reported that task 
switching can cost from 20 percent to 40 percent loss in efficiency (Rubinstein, Meyer, & 
Evans, 2001). 
Some have argued that the propensity to deal with resource shortages by splitting 
is a major reason projects fail to meet schedule (c.f., Goldratt, 1997). We agree. Plan￾ners should avoid the use of splitting as much as possible, except in situations where 
splitting costs are known to be small or when there is no alternative for resolving 
the resource problem. Likewise, project managers need to protect against unneces￾sary interruptions and avoid the temptation to switch people for expediency’s sake. 
Computer software offers the splitting option for each activity; use it sparingly.

Understand when and 
why splitting tasks

8.7 Benefits of Scheduling Resources
It is important to remember that if resources are truly limited and activity time esti￾mates are accurate, the resource-constrained schedule will materialize as the project 
is implemented—not the time-constrained schedule! Therefore, failure to schedule 
limited resources can lead to serious problems for a project manager. The benefit of 
creating this schedule before the project begins leaves time for considering reasonable 
alternatives. If the scheduled delay is unacceptable or the risk of being delayed too 
high, the assumption of being resource constrained can be reassessed. Cost-time trade￾offs can be considered. In some cases priorities may be changed. See Snapshot from 
Practice 8.3: U.S. Forest Service Resource Shortage.
Resource schedules provide the information needed to prepare time-phased work 
package budgets with dates. Once established, they provide a quick means for a proj￾ect manager to gauge the impact of unforeseen events such as turnover, equipment 
breakdowns, or transfer of project personnel. Resource schedules also allow project 
managers to assess how much flexibility they have over certain resources. This is use￾ful when they receive requests from other managers to borrow or share resources. 
Honoring such requests creates goodwill and an “IOU” that can be cashed in during a 
time of need.
A major segment of work in managing 
U.S. Forest Service (USFS) forests is 
selling mature timber to logging com￾panies that harvest the timber under 
contract conditions monitored by the 
service. The proceeds are returned to the federal gov￾ernment. The budget allocated to each forest depends 
on the two-year plan submitted to the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture.
Olympic Forest headquarters in Olympia, Washing￾ton, was developing a two-year plan as a basis for fund￾ing. All of the districts in the forest submitted their timber 
sale projects (numbering more than 50) to headquar￾ters, where they were compiled and aggregated into 
a project plan for the whole forest. The first computer 
run was reviewed by a small group of senior managers 
to determine if the plan was reasonable and “doable.” 
Management was pleased and relieved to note all proj￾ects appeared to be doable in the two-year time frame 
until a question was raised concerning the computer 
printout. “Why are all the columns in these projects 
labeled ‘RESOURCE’ blank?” The response from an 
engineer was “We don’t use that part of the program.”
The discussion that ensued recognized the impor￾tance of resources in completing the two-year plan 
and ended with a request to “try the program with 
resources included.” The new output was startling. The 
two-year program turned into a three-and-a-half-year 
plan because of the shortage of specific labor skills 
such as road engineer and environmental impact spe￾cialist. Analysis showed that adding only three skilled 
people would allow the two-year plan to be completed 
on time. In addition, further analysis showed hiring only 
a few more skilled people, beyond the three, would 
allow an extra year of projects to also be compressed 
into the two-year plan. This would result in additional 
revenue of more than $3 million. The Department of 
Agriculture quickly approved the requested extra dol￾lars for additional staff to generate the extra revenue.

8.8 Assigning Project Work
When making individual assignments, project managers should match, as best they 
can, the demands and requirements of specific work with the qualifications and expe￾rience of available participants. In doing so, there is a natural tendency to assign the 
best people the most difficult tasks. Project managers need to be careful not to overdo 
this. Over time these people may grow to resent the fact that they are always given the 
toughest assignments. At the same time, less experienced participants may resent the 
fact that they are never given the opportunity to expand their skill/knowledge base. 
Project managers need to balance task performance with the need to develop the tal￾ents of people assigned to the project.
Project managers need to decide not only who does what but also who works with 
whom. A number of factors need to be considered in deciding who should work 
together. First, to minimize unnecessary tension, managers should pick people with 
compatible work habits and personalities but who complement each other (i.e., one 
person’s weakness is the other person’s strength). For example, one person may be 
brilliant at solving complex problems but sloppy at documenting his/her progress. It 
would be wise to pair this person with an individual who is good at paying attention to 
details. Experience is another factor. Veterans should be teamed up with new hires—
not only so they can share their experience but also to help socialize the newcomers 
to the customs and norms of the organization. Finally, future needs should be consid￾ered. If managers have some people who have never worked together before but who 
have to later on in the project, they may be wise to take advantage of opportunities to 
have these people work together early on so that they can become familiar with each 
other. Finally, see Snapshot from Practice 8.4: Managing Geeks for some interesting 
thoughts from the former CEO of Google on how to put together teams.
LO 8-7
Identify general 
guidelines for assigning 
people to specific tasks.
Eric Schmidt, after a successful career 
at Sun Microsystems, took over strug￾gling Novell, Inc., and helped turn it 
around within two years. Four years 
later he became the CEO of Google. 
One of the keys to his success is his ability to manage 
the technical wizards who develop the sophisticated 
systems, hardware, and software that are the back￾bone of electronically driven companies. He uses the 
term “geek” (and he can, since he is one, with a Ph.D. 
in computer science) to describe this group of technol￾ogists who rule the cyberworld.
Schmidt has some interesting ideas about assign￾ing geeks to projects. He believes that putting geeks 
together in project teams with other geeks creates pro￾ductive peer pressure. Geeks care a great deal about 
how other geeks perceive them. They are good at judg￾ing the quality of technical work and are quick to praise 
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 8.4 Managing Geeks*
as well as criticize each other’s work. Some geeks can 
be unbearably arrogant, but Schmidt claims that having 
them work together on projects is the best way to con￾trol them—by letting them control each other.
At the same time, Schmidt argues that too many 
geeks spoil the soup. By this he means that when 
there are too many geeks on a development team, 
there is a tendency for intense technical navel gaz￾ing. Members lose sight of deadlines, and delays are 
inevitable. To combat this tendency, he recommends 
using geeks only in small groups. He urges breaking up 
large projects into smaller, more manageable projects 
so that small teams of geeks can be assigned to them. 
This keeps the project on time and makes the teams 
responsible to each other.

8.9 Multiproject Resource Schedules
For clarity we have discussed key resource allocation issues within the context of a 
single project. In reality resource allocation generally occurs in a multiproject envi￾ronment where the demands of one project have to be reconciled with the needs of 
other projects. Organizations must develop and manage systems for efficiently allocat￾ing and scheduling resources across several projects with different priorities, resource 
requirements, sets of activities, and risks. The system must be dynamic and capable 
of accommodating new projects as well as reallocating resources once project work is 
completed. While the same resource issues and principles that apply to a single project 
also apply to this multiproject environment, application and solutions are more com￾plex, given the interdependency among projects.
The following are three of the more common problems encountered in managing 
multiproject resource schedules. Note that these are macro manifestations of single￾project problems that are now magnified in a multiproject environment.
1. Overall schedule slippage. Because projects often share resources, delays in one 
project can have a ripple effect and delay other projects. For example, work on one 
software development project can grind to a halt because the coders scheduled for the 
next critical task are late in completing their work on another development project.
2. Inefficient resource utilization. Because projects have different schedules and 
requirements, there are peaks and valleys in overall resource demands. For exam￾ple, a firm may have a staff of 10 electricians to meet peak demands when, under 
normal conditions, only 5 electricians are required.
3. Resource bottlenecks. Delays and schedules are extended as a result of shortages of 
critical resources that are required by multiple projects. For example, at one Lattice 
Semiconductor facility, project schedules were delayed because of competition over 
access to test the equipment necessary to debug programs. Likewise, several projects at 
a U.S. forest area were extended because there was only one silviculturist on the staff.
To deal with these problems, more and more companies are creating project offices or 
departments to oversee the scheduling of resources across multiple projects. One approach 
to multiple project resource scheduling is to use a first come–first served rule. A project 
queue system is created in which projects currently under way take precedence over new 
projects. New project schedules are based on the projected availability of resources. This 
queuing tends to lead to more reliable completion estimates and is preferred on contracted 
projects that have stiff penalties for being late. The disadvantages of this deceptively sim￾ple approach are that it does not optimally utilize resources or take into account the prior￾ity of the project. See Snapshot from Practice 8.5: Multiple Project Resource Scheduling.
Many companies utilize more elaborate processes for scheduling resources to 
increase the capacity of the organization to initiate projects. Most of these methods 
approach the problem by treating individual projects as part of one big project and 
adapting the scheduling heuristics previously introduced to this “mega project.” Proj￾ect schedulers monitor resource usage and provide updated schedules based on prog￾ress and resource availability across all projects. One major improvement in project 
management software in recent years is the ability to prioritize resource allocation to 
specific projects. Projects can be prioritized in ascending order (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .), 
and these priorities will override scheduling heuristics so that resources go to the 
project highest on the priority list. (Note: This improvement fits perfectly with orga￾nizations that use project priority models similar to those described in Chapter 2.) 
Centralized project scheduling also makes it easier to identify resource bottlenecks 
Identify common prob￾lems with multiproject 
resource scheduling.

that stifle progress on projects. Once bottlenecks have been identified, their impact 
can be documented and used to justify acquiring additional equipment, recruiting 
critical personnel, or delaying the project.
Finally, many companies are using outsourcing as a means of dealing with their 
resource allocation problems. In some cases, a company will reduce the number of 
projects they have to manage internally to only core projects and outsource noncriti￾cal projects to contractors and consulting firms. In other cases, specific segments of 
projects are outsourced to overcome resource deficiencies and scheduling problems. 
Companies may hire temporary workers to expedite certain activities that are falling 
behind schedule or contract project work during peak periods when there are insuf￾ficient internal resources to meet the demands of all projects. The ability to more effi￾ciently manage the ebbs and flows of project work is one of the major driving forces 
behind outsourcing today, which is the subject of Chapter 12.
8.10 Using the Resource Schedule to Develop a Project Cost Baseline
Once resource assignments have been finalized, you are able to develop a baseline 
budget schedule for the project. Using your project schedule, you can time-phase work 
packages and assign them to their respective scheduled activities to develop a budget 
schedule over the life of your project. Understanding the reason for time-phasing your 
budget is very important. Without a time-phased budget, a good project schedule and 
cost control are impossible.
Why a Time-Phased Budget Baseline Is Needed
The need for a time-phased budget baseline is demonstrated in the following scenario. 
The development of a new product is to be completed in 10 weeks at an estimated cost 
LO 8-9
Explain why a time￾phased budget baseline 
is needed.
The case for a central source to over￾see project resource scheduling is 
well known by practitioners. Here is 
a synopsis of a conversation with one 
middle manager.
Interviewer: Congratulations on acceptance of your 
multiproject scheduling proposal. Everyone tells me 
you were very convincing.
Middle Manager: Thanks. Gaining acceptance 
was easy this time. The board quickly recognized 
we have no choice if we are to keep ahead of 
competition by placing our resources on the right 
projects.
Interviewer: Have you presented this to the board 
before?
Middle Manager: Yes, but not this company. I pre￾sented the same spiel to the firm I worked for two years 
ago. For their annual review meeting I was charged to 
present a proposal suggesting the need and benefits 
of central capacity resource planning for managing the 
projects of the firm.
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 8.5 Multiple Project 
Resource Scheduling
I tried to build a case for bringing projects under 
one umbrella to standardize practices and to forecast 
and assign key people to mission critical projects. 
I explained how benefits such as resource demands 
would be aligned with mission critical projects, pro￾active resource planning, and a tool for catching 
resource bottlenecks and resolving conflicts.
Almost everyone agreed the idea was a good one. 
I felt good about the presentation and felt confident 
something was going to happen. But the idea never 
really got off the ground; it just faded into the sunset.
With hindsight, managers really did not trust col￾leagues in other departments, so they only gave half￾hearted support to central resource planning. Managers 
wanted to protect their turf and ensure that they would 
not have to give up power. The culture there was simply 
too inflexible for the world we live in today. They are still 
struggling with constant conflicts among projects.
I’m glad I made the switch to this firm. The culture 
here is much more team-oriented. Management is 
committed to improving performance.

of $400,000 per week, for a total cost of $4 million. Management wants a status report 
at the end of five weeks. The following information has been collected:
∙ Planned costs for the first five weeks are $2,000,000.
∙ Actual costs for the first five weeks are $2,400,000.
How are we doing? It would be easy to draw the conclusion there is a $400,000 cost over￾run. But we really have no way of knowing. The $400,000 may represent money spent to 
move the project ahead of schedule. Assume another set of data at the end of Five weeks:
∙ Planned costs for the first five weeks are $2,000,000.
∙ Actual costs for the first five weeks are $1,700,000.
Is the project costing $300,000 less than we expected? Perhaps. But the $300,000 may 
represent the fact that the project is behind schedule and work has not started. Could 
it be the project is behind schedule and over cost? We cannot tell from these data. The 
many systems found in the real world that use only planned funds (a constant burn 
rate) and actual costs can provide false and misleading information. There is no way 
to be certain how much of the physical work has been accomplished. These systems do 
not measure how much work was accomplished for the money spent! Hence, without 
time-phasing cost to match your project schedule, it is impossible to have reliable 
information for control purposes.
Creating a Time-Phased Budget
By using information from your WBS and resource schedule, you can create a time￾phased cost baseline. Remember from the WBS for the E-Slim Tablet Project in Chapter 4 
that we integrated the WBS and OBS organization breakdown structure so the work 
packages could be tracked by deliverable and organization responsible. See Figure 8.12 
for an example of a similar prototype project arranged by deliverable and organization 
unit responsible. For each intersection point of the WBS/OBS matrix, you see work 
package budgets and the total cost. The total cost at each intersection is called a cost or 
control account. For example, at the intersection of the Read/write head deliverable and 
the Production Department we see there are three work packages with a total budget 
of $200,000. The sum of all cost accounts in a column should represent the total costs 
for the deliverable. Conversely, the sum of the cost accounts in a row should represent 
the costs or budget for the organization unit responsible for accomplishing the work. 
You can continue to “roll up” costs on the WBS/OBS to total project costs. This WBS 
provides the information you can use to time-phase work packages and assign them to 
their respective scheduled activities over the life of the project. 
Recall, from the development of your work breakdown structure for each work 
package, the following information needed to be developed:
1. Define work (what).
2. Identify time to complete a work package (how long).
3. Identify a time-phased budget to complete a work package (cost).
4. Identify resources needed to complete a work package (how much).
5. Identify a single person responsible for units of work (who).
6. Identify monitoring points for measuring progress (how well).
Number three, time-phasing the work package, is critical for the final step of creating 
your budget baseline. The process of time-phasing work packages, which is illustrated 
next, is demonstrated in Figure 8.13. The work package has a duration of three weeks. 
Assuming labor, materials, and equipment are tracked separately, the work package costs

for labor are distributed over the three weeks as they are expected to occur—$40,000, 
$30,000, and $50,000 for each week, respectively. When the three-week work package 
is placed in the network schedule, the costs are distributed to the time-phased budget for 
the same three scheduled weeks. Fortunately, most single WPs become an activity and 
Final PDF to printerChapter 8 Scheduling Resources and Costs 291
lar60886_ch08_265-325.indd 291 10/14/23 11:45 am
the process of distributing costs is relatively simple. That is, the relationship is one-for￾one. Such budget timing is directly from the work package to the activity. 
In a few instances an activity will include more than one work package, where the pack￾ages are assigned to one responsible person or department and deliverable. In this case 
the work packages are consolidated into one activity. As seen in Figure 8.14, this activity 
includes two WPs. The first, WP-1.1.3.2.4.1 (Code), is distributed over the first three weeks. 
The second, WP-1.1.3.2.4.2 (Integration), is sequenced over weeks 3 and 4. The activity 
duration is four weeks. When the activity is placed in the schedule, the costs are distributed 
starting with the schedule start—$20,000, $15,000, $75,000, and $70,000, respectively. 
These time-phased budgets for work packages are lifted from your WBS and are 
placed in your project schedule as they are expected to occur over the life of the proj￾ect. The outcome of these budget allocations is the project cost baseline (also called 
planned value—PV), which is used to determine cost and schedule variances as the 
project is implemented.
Figure 8.15 shows the Patient Entry project network schedule, which is used to 
place the time-phased work packages’ budgets in the baseline. Figure 8.16 presents 
the project time-phased budget for the Patient Entry project and the cumulative graph 
of the project budget baseline. In this figure, you can see how the time-phased work 
package costs were placed into the network and how the cumulative project budget 
graph for a project is developed. Notice that costs do not have to be distributed linearly, 
but the costs should be placed as you expect them to occur. 
You have now developed complete time and cost plans for your project. These project 
baselines will be used to compare planned schedule and costs using an integrative system 
called earned value. The application and use of project baselines to measure performance 
are discussed in detail in Chapter 13. With your project budget baseline established, you 
are also able to generate cash flow statements for your project, like the one presented in 
Figure 8.17. Such statements prepare the firm to cover costs over the lifespan of the proj￾ect. Finally, with resource assignments finalized, you are able to generate resource usage 
schedules for your project (see Figure 8.18). These schedules map out the full deployment 
of personnel and equipment and can be used to generate individual work schedules.

lar60886_ch08_265-325.indd 294 10/14/23 11:45 am
Summary A project schedule is not a schedule until resources have been assigned. If resources are 
inadequate then task sequences are likely to be impacted and the schedule extended. If 
resources are adequate it may be advantageous to “smooth” resources to improve their 
utilization. The results after resource scheduling are frequently significantly different 
from the results of the standard CPM method.
With the rapid changes in technology and emphasis on time-to-market, catching 
resource usage and availability problems before the project starts can save the costs 
of crashing (reducing) project activities later. Any resource deviations from plan and 
schedule that occur when the project is being implemented can be quickly recorded 
and the effect noted. Without this immediate update capability, the real negative effect 
of a change may not be known until it happens. Tying resource availability to a multi￾project, multiresource system supports a project priority process that selects projects 
by their contribution to the organization’s objectives and strategic plan.
Assignment of individuals to projects may not fit well with those assigned by com￾puter software routines. In these cases, overriding the computer solution to accommo￾date individual differences and skills is almost always the best choice.
The project resource schedule is important because it serves as your time baseline, 
which is used for measuring time differences between plan and actual. The resource 
schedule serves as the basis for developing your time-phased project cost budget base￾line. The baseline (planned value, PV) is the sum of the cost accounts, and each cost 
account is the sum of the work packages in the cost account. Remember, if your bud￾geted costs are not time-phased, you have no reliable way to measure performance. 
Although there are several types of project costs, the cost baseline is usually limited to 
direct costs (such as labor, materials, and equipment) that are under the control of the 
project manager; other, indirect costs can be added to project costs separately.

1. Consider a project with the accompanying Gantt chart. Stella is your only electrical 
engineer and she is responsible for activities 3 and 4, which overlap. Level the proj￾ect so that Stella is only working a maximum of eight hours each day. What would 
the new Gantt chart look like? What would be the new project completion date?

2. Bjorn and Thor are plumbers who have been scheduled to work on the construc￾tion of a new school building. Just before the start of the project, Bjorn broke his 
arm and cannot work on the project. Now Thor has to handle his own activities as 
well as Bjorn’s. Level the project Gantt chart so that Thor is responsible for activi￾ties 3, 4, 6, and 7. What is the new estimated completion date for the project? 
3. Suppose instead of assigning Bjorn’s work to Thor, you have the opportunity to 
hire two new plumbers to perform Bjorn tasks (shortening them by 50 percent). 
What would the new project estimated completion date be? Show your work.
Consider a project with the following Gantt chart to answer exercises 2 and 3.

activities are now critical? What is the project duration now? 
6. Compute the early, late, and slack times for the activities in the network that fol￾lows, assuming a time-constrained network. Which activities are critical? What is 
the time-constrained project duration?
Note: Recall that in the schedule resource load chart the time-constrained
scheduling interval (ES through LF) has been shaded. Any resource scheduled 
beyond the shaded area will delay the project.
Assume you have only three resources and you are using software that sched￾ules projects by the parallel method and following heuristics. Schedule only one 
period at a time!
Minimum slack
Smallest duration
Lowest identification number
Keep a log of each activity change and update you make each period—for exam￾ple, period 0–1, 1–2, 2–3, etc. (Use a format similar to the one on page 274)

The log should include any changes or updates in ES, LF, and slack times each 
period, activities scheduled, and activities delayed. (Hint: Remember to maintain 
the technical dependencies of the network.) Use the resource load chart to assist 
you in scheduling (see Figures 8.4 and 8.5).
List the order in which you scheduled the activities of the project. Which activi￾ties of your schedule are now critical?
Recompute your slack for each activity, given your new schedule. What is the 
slack for activity 1? 4? 5? 
7. You have prepared the following schedule for a project in which the key resource 
is a tractor(s).* There are three tractors available to the project. Activities A and D 
require one tractor to complete, while activities B, C, E, and F require two 
tractors.

You tell Brooker you are willing to let him have the backhoe if you are still able to 
complete your project in 11 months.
Develop a resource schedule in the loading chart that follows to see if it is possi￾ble to complete the project in 11 months with only two backhoes. Be sure to record 
the order in which you schedule the activities using scheduling heuristics. Activities 
5 and 6 require two backhoes, while activities 1, 2, 3, and 4 require one backhoe. No 
splitting of activities is possible. Can you say yes to Brooker’s request?

Prepare a short proposal for the Smiths that includes a Gantt chart with resources 
assigned and cost estimates if the project starts on 8/1/24. Did resource limitations 
affect the final schedule? If so, how? What financial risks does this project face? What 
can the Smiths do to protect themselves against those risks?
 Case 8.1
Blue Mountain Cabin
Jack and Jill Smith have just retired and want to build a small, basic cabin in the Blue 
Mountains of Vermont. They have hired Daryl Hannah as the general contractor for 
the project. She has assembled a team of three workers to complete the project: Tom, 
Dick, and Harry. Daryl has negotiated a cost-plus contract with the Smiths whereby 
she will receive 15 percent beyond the cost of labor and materials.
Before they sign the contract the Smiths want an estimate of how much the project 
is likely to cost and how long it will take.
Daryl has estimated that the cost for materials, permits, etc., will total $80,000. She 
wants to determine labor costs as well as how long the project will take. This is one of 
several projects Daryl is managing, and other than occasionally helping out, her role is 
strictly limited to supervising. She has devised the following master plan and assignments.
Note that Dick is the only skilled plumber in the group, while Harry is the only 
skilled electrician. Tom is a general carpenter and can assist them with their work. 
Dick and Harry each get paid $600 a day, while Tom gets paid $400 per day.
Daryl has negotiated a 10 percent management reserve to deal with unexpected 
problems. Unused funds will be returned to the Smiths.

Power Train, Ltd.
Memo: Power Train Management Team
We have great information systems for reporting, tracking, and controlling costs on 
design projects. Our planning of projects is better than any I have seen at other compa￾nies. Our scheduling seemed to serve us well when we were small and we had only a few 
projects. Now that we have many more projects and schedule using multiproject software, 
there are too many occasions when the right people are not assigned to the projects deemed 
important to our success. This situation is costing us big money, headaches, and stress!

HISTORY
Power Train (PT), Ltd., was founded in 1970 by Daniel Gage, a skilled mechanical 
engineer and machinist. Prior to founding PT he worked for three years as design 
engineer for a company that designed and built transmissions for military tanks and 
trucks. It was a natural transition for Dan to start a company designing and building 
power trains for farm tractor companies. Today Dan is no longer active in the manage￾ment of PT but is still revered as its founder. He and his family still own 25 percent of 
the company, which went public in 1998. PT has been growing at a 6 percent clip for 
the last five years but expects industry growth to level off as supply exceeds demand.
Today PT continues its proud tradition of designing and building the best-quality 
power trains for manufacturers of farm tractors and equipment. The company employs 
178 design engineers and has about 1,800 production and support staff. Contract 
design projects for tractor manufacturers represent a major portion of PT’s revenue. 
At any given time, about 45 to 60 design projects are going on concurrently. A small 
portion of their design work is for military vehicles. PT only accepts military contracts 
that involve very advanced, new technology and are cost plus.
A new phenomenon has attracted the management of PT to look into a larger mar￾ket. Last year a large Swedish truck manufacturer approached PT to consider design￾ing power trains for its trucks. As the industry consolidates, the opportunities for PT 
should increase because these large firms are moving to more outsourcing to cut infra￾structure costs and stay very flexible. Only last week a PT design engineer spoke to 
a German truck manufacturing manager at a conference. The German manager was 
already exploring outsourcing of drive trains to Porsche and was very pleased to be 
reminded of PT’s expertise in the area. A meeting is set up for next month.
CLAUDE JONES
Claude Jones joined PT in 1999 as a new MBA from the University of Edinburgh. He 
worked as a mechanical engineer for U.K. Hydraulics for five years prior to returning 
to school for the MBA. “I just wanted to be part of the management team and where 
the action is.” Claude moved quickly through the ranks. Today he is the vice president 
of design and operations. Sitting at his desk, Claude is pondering the conflicts and 
confusion that seem to be increasing in scheduling people to projects. He gets a real 
rush at the thought of designing power trains for large trucks; however, given their cur￾rent project scheduling problems, a large increase in business would only compound 
their problems. Somehow these conflicts in scheduling have to be resolved before any 
serious thought can be given to expanding into the design of power transmissions for 
truck manufacturers.
Claude is thinking of the problems PT had in the last year. The MF project is the 
first to come to mind. The project was not terribly complex and did not require their 
best design engineers. Unfortunately, the scheduling software assigned one of the most 
creative and expensive engineers to the MF project. A similar situation, but reversed, 
happened on the Deer project. This project involved a big customer and new hydro￾static technology for small tractors. In this project the scheduling software assigned 
engineers who were not familiar with small tractor transmissions. Somehow, thinks 
Claude, the right people need to be scheduled to the right projects. Upon reflection, 
this problem with scheduling has been increasing since PT went to multiproject sched￾uling. Maybe a project office is needed to keep on top of these problems.
A meeting with the information technology team and software vendors was posi￾tive but not very helpful because these people are not really into detailed scheduling 
Final PDF to printer310 Chapter 8 Scheduling Resources and Costs
lar60886_ch08_265-325.indd 310 10/14/23 11:45 am
problems. The vendors provided all sorts of evidence suggesting the heuristics used—
least slack, shortest duration, and identification number—are absolutely efficient in 
scheduling people and minimizing project delays. One project software vendor, Lau￾ren, kept saying their software would allow PT to customize the scheduling of projects 
and people to almost any variation selected. Lauren repeated over and over, “If the 
standard heuristics do not meet your requirements, create your own heuristics that do.” 
Lauren even volunteered to assist in setting up the system. But she is not willing to 
spend time on the problem until PT can describe to her exactly what criteria will be 
used (and their sequence) to select and schedule people to projects.
WHAT NEXT?
Potential expansion into the truck power train business is not feasible until the confu￾sion in project scheduling is solved or reduced significantly. Claude is ready to tackle 
this problem, but he is not sure where to start. What criteria should he consider? What 
should be the sequence for selecting and assigning people to projects?
 Case 8.3
Tham Luang Cave Rescue
On June 23, 2018, in Thailand, a group of 12 boys aged between 11 and 17 from 
the local football team, named the Wild Boars, and their 23-year-old assistant coach 
entered the Tham Luang cave. Tham Luang is a large cave complex in northern Thai￾land along the border with Myanmar. The cavern was popular with locals and the 
boys had visited Tham Luang before. Tham Luang cave is isolated—there is no GPS, 
Wi-Fi, or cell phone service. The last known survey was conducted in the 1980s by a 
French caving society, but many of the deeper recesses remain unmapped.
The boys had little difficulty getting fairly far into the cave, crawling through a 
couple of choke points to open spaces. They did not anticipate any problems getting 
back. The monsoon rains weren’t expected until the next week, and the year before, 
the cave did not begin to flood until the middle of July. The team took no food with 
them, because this was going to be a brief field trip. They planned to stay for perhaps 
an hour, then return home to their parents.
However, nature had different plans. Heavy monsoon rain began to fall. The Wild 
Boars didn’t know about the rain at first. There was a thousand feet of rock above them 
and they were more than a mile from the open forest. Heavy rains gathered in streams 
that disappeared into sinks, rushing through limestone into the cavern. Water rose sud￾denly and quickly, forcing the team to retreat farther and farther into the cave. The 
interior of the cave is not level but rather rises and falls as it burrows into the moun￾tain. The team scrambled for higher ground as the water continued to rise. Finally, they 
settled on a mud slope and waited to see if the water would continue to rise. It didn’t.
A mother of one of the boys contacted the police when her child failed to come 
home. A teammate who had missed practice that day told people that the team had 
planned to visit the cave after practice. Parents rushed to the cave, only to find their 
children’s bikes and cleats at the entrance and the cave flooded.
A contingent of Thai Navy SEAL divers arrived the next day and began push￾ing their way into the flooded cave. This was no easy task. The Thai frogmen were 
accustomed to tropical open water, not the dark, cold currents racing through the cave.

lar60886_ch08_265-325.indd 311 10/14/23 11:45 am
They lacked equipment, much less expertise needed for caves, where divers cannot just 
rise to the surface if something goes wrong.
The plight of the Wild Boars drew international attention overnight. Soon skilled 
cave divers from around the world, including Finland, Britain, China, Australia, and 
the United States, volunteered their services. At first the foreign divers were not met 
with open arms by the Thai military in charge of the rescue. Many of the Thai divers 
bristled at the idea of needing foreign assistance. The divers were not even allowed 
into the cave. After much political haggling, the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs told 
the military chiefs to let the foreign divers go.
Even the experienced cave divers found the conditions extremely difficult. “It was 
like walking into a strong waterfall and feeling the water rushing at you,” one diver 
said. “It was a horizontal climb against water with every move.”
The divers painstakingly penetrated the cave, securing guidelines needed to ensure 
safety. Visibility at times was negligible. “If you put your hand in front of you, it just 
disappeared,” said one diver. “You couldn’t see anything.”
Meanwhile, on the surface, policemen with sniffer dogs searched for shaft openings 
that could provide an alternative entrance to the cave system. The search was aug￾mented by hundreds of volunteers dressed in lemon-yellow shirts and sky-blue caps, 
searching for hidden cracks in the limestone that might reveal an opening to the cave. 
Drones were also used, but no technology existed to scan for humans deep under￾ground. Local holy men created a shrine at the mouth of the cave, where they chanted 
and communed with the spirit of the cave, “Jao Mae Tham.” Several times the search 
had to be suspended due to heavy rains.
After the team had spent 10 days of captivity without real food or water, there was 
little hope among the rescuers of discovering the boys alive. Two of the British divers 
asked to book flights home.
On the 11th day, a pair of British divers working to extend the guide ropes popped 
up near a narrow ledge. First they smelled, and then they saw, 13 emaciated people 
perched in the dark. The Wild Boars had run out of food and light but had survived by 
sipping the condensation from the cave walls. Later it was reported that the assistant 
coach, a Buddhist, had led the boys in meditation to relax and conserve energy. The 
ledge where they were found was about 2.5 miles from the cave mouth.
The next day Thai SEALs ferried food, water, and blankets to the Wild Boars. 
Four divers, including a doctor, would stay with them until their rescue. Thai officials 
reported that the rescuers were providing health checks, keeping the boys entertained, 
and none of the boys were in serious condition.
Thai officials released a video made by the rescuers and shared to the world. The 
video showed all 12 boys and their coach introducing themselves and stating their 
ages. Wrapped in emergency blankets and appearing frail, each boy said hello to the 
outside world, “Sawasdee krub,” with his palms together in wai, the traditional Thai 
greeting. The video went viral. Soon all the major newscasts across the world were 
covering the story. The big question then became, now that the boys had been found, 
how could they be gotten out alive?
A rescue camp was set up at the cave entrance, accommodating the volunteers 
and journalists in addition to the rescue workers. The camp was divided into zones: 
restricted areas for the Thai Navy SEALs, other military personnel, and civil￾ian rescuers; an area for relatives to wait in privacy; and areas for the press and 
general public.
An estimated 10,000 people contributed to the rescue effort, including more than 
100 divers, 900 police officers, 2,000 soldiers, and numerous volunteers. Equipment

lar60886_ch08_265-325.indd 312 10/14/23 11:45 am
included 10 police helicopters, seven ambulances, and more than 700 diving cylinders, 
of which more than 500 were in the cave at any time while another 200 were in queue 
to be refilled.
The plight of the Wild Boars caught the attention of Elon Musk of Tesla and Space 
X fame. He tasked engineers to build a kid-size submarine that could be used to trans￾port the boys out of the cave. Within days an actual submarine was sent to Tham 
Luang. Thai officials praised the effort but concluded it was not practical, given the 
narrow passages in the cavern.
The journey through the cave to the team took six hours against current and five 
hours to exit with the current. The route had several flooded sections, some with strong 
currents and zero visibility, and some extremely narrow parts, the smallest measuring 
only 15 by 28 inches. The boys were perched on a ledge 400 yards from Pattaya beach 
chamber, named after an above-ground beach in Thailand. Chamber 3, which was dry, 
would be used as rescue base.
Pumps were brought in to remove water from the cave. Although not a solution, 
efforts at draining the cave began to produce results. Crags and outcroppings emerged 
from the murk. The most challenging passage, which had taken five hours to navigate 
early on, could now be traversed in two hours with the help of guide ropes.
As the crisis unfolded, rescuers considered several different methods to save the 
team. The principal options included
∙ Wait until the end of the monsoon season, with divers providing food and water.
∙ Find an alternative entrance to the cave that would allow for an easier escape.
∙ Drill a rescue shaft.
∙ Teach the group basic diving skills and have them swim out with the divers.
Waiting until the monsoons ended in November and the water drained was the sim￾plest solution. The boys could walk out on their own. However, the logistics did not 
make sense. Feeding 13 people, three times a day, for even 60 days is more than 
2,750 meals. Every meal would have to be ferried in by a team of divers, flirting with 
death each time they went under.
This was a growing concern. Four days after the boys were found, retired Navy SEAL 
diver Saman Kunan lost consciousness while returning from dropping off three air tanks. 
His dive buddy attempted CPR without success. Kunan had left his airport security job 
to volunteer for the rescue mission. Before that fatality, three divers were lost for over 
three hours in the dark cave, and rescue efforts had to be redirected to find them.
From the beginning, hundreds of volunteers crawled over the hillside in search of 
hidden openings. People knew the odds were slim to none, given the depth of the cave, 
but it was worth a try.
Drilling through a couple thousand feet of rock would require extensive infrastructure 
work and take too long. Besides, there was significant uncertainty as to where to drill.
That left the fourth option. None of the boys or the coach knew how to dive. Even 
if they could master the basics, cave diving is not the same as a practice run at a resort 
swimming pool. A weakened child submerged in darkness and breathing unnaturally 
through a regulator is likely to panic. Yet through long stretches of the cave, he wouldn’t 
be able to surface and regain his composure—he would be in a flooded tunnel.
Privately experts thought maybe half the boys would survive the journey. But pull￾ing it off 13 times in a row would take a miracle.
While plans were being developed, two alarming events occurred. First, the oxygen 
levels in the cave began to drop faster than anticipated. This raised fears that the boys 
could develop hypoxia if they remained for a prolonged time. By July 7, the oxygen 
Final PDF to printerChapter 8 Scheduling Resources and Costs 313
lar60886_ch08_265-325.indd 313 10/14/23 11:45 am
level was measured to be 15 percent. The level needed to maintain normal functions 
for humans is between 19.5 percent and 23.5 percent. Thai engineers’ attempts to 
install an air supply line to the boys failed.
The second development was the weather forecast. Monsoon rains were predicted 
for later in the week, which could flood the cave until November.
The Thai Navy SEALs, with the support of U.S. Air Force rescue experts, devised 
a plan approved by the Thai Minister of the Interior. Rescuers initially wanted to teach 
the boys basic diving skills to enable them to make the journey. Organizers even built 
a mockup of a tight passage with chairs and had divers practice with local boys in a 
nearby school swimming pool. Eventually it was decided that the boys were too weak 
to swim, and the plan was revised to have divers bring the boys out. The breakthrough 
came when planners considered medicating the boys so as they would become sedated.
On July 8, the rescue attempt was initiated. For the first part of the mission, 18 div￾ers were sent into the caves to retrieve the boys, with one diver to accompany each boy 
on the dive out. The boys were dressed in a wetsuit, a buoyancy jacket, and a harness. 
Instead of sticking a regulator in each boy’s mouth, they were given a full face mask 
that allowed them to breathe naturally. An oxygen cylinder was clipped to their front, 
a handle was attached to their back, and they were tethered to a diver in case they were 
lost in poor visibility.
Panic was a chief concern. The SEAL doctor administered an anesthetic to the boys 
before the journey, rendering them unconscious to prevent them from panicking on the 
escape and risking the lives of their rescuers.1
 The anesthetic lasted about 50 minutes, 
requiring the divers, whom the doctor had trained, to re-sedate their bodies during the 
three-hour-plus journey.
There was discussion about which boy should go first—the weakest, the youngest, the 
strongest—but in the end it came to a boy who volunteered. The boys were maneuvered 
out by the divers holding on to their back or chest, with each boy on the left or right 
depending upon the guideline. In very narrow spots, the divers had to push the boys from 
behind. The divers kept their heads higher than the boys so that in poor visibility the 
divers would hit their heads first against the rocks. After a short dive to a dry section of 
cave, the divers and boys were met by three divers, and the boys’ dive gear was removed. 
A drag stretcher was used to transport the boys up over a 200-meter stretch of rocks and 
sandy hills. The dive gear was put back on before entering the next submerged section. 
The duo negotiated the narrow, underwater at times, passage way to chamber 2.
After being delivered by the divers into the rescue base in chamber 3, the boys were 
then passed along a “daisy chain” of hundreds of workers stationed along the treacher￾ous path out of the cave. The boys were alternately carried, slid, and zip-lined over a 
complex network of pulleys installed by rock climbers. The path out of the chamber 
contained many areas still partially submerged, and the boys had to be transported 
over slippery rocks and through muddy waters. The journey out of chamber 3 took 
about four to five hours initially, less later as a result of drainage.
Soon after 7 p.m. local officials announced that two boys had been rescued. Shortly 
later, two more boys appeared out of the cave. On July 9, four more boys were rescued. 
On July 10, the last four boys and their coach were rescued.
The four Thai Navy SEALs, including the doctor who had stayed with the boys the 
entire time, were the last to dive out. When they got to chamber 3, a water pipe burst, 
and the main pump stopped working. All of a sudden, the water began to rise rapidly. 
This forced the SEALs and 100 of the rescuers still a mile inside the cave to abandon 
the rescue equipment and scramble out of the cave.

 The Thai government provided the SEAL doctor with diplomatic immunity if something went wrong.

Upon reaching the surface the boys were quarantined while health workers deter￾mined whether they had caught any infectious diseases. The boys were on a fixed 
rice porridge diet for the first 10 days. Parents initially visited their children looking 
through a window, but once the laboratory results proved negative, they were allowed 
to visit in person while wearing a medical gown, face mask, and hair cap.
During their 11-day ordeal, the assistant coach was confident they were going to be 
rescued and encouraged the boys not to be worried or scared. He led the boys in medita￾tion to relax and conserve energy. The boys chanted “su-su” which is Thai for “fight on.” 
Chanin Viboonrungruang, the youngest team member told reporters, “We felt dizzy and 
hungry. . . we tried not to think of food, like fried rice, because it would make us hungrier.”
After the rescue, the boys’ families, officials, and thousands of volunteers gathered 
at the cave entrance. The group gave thanks for the lives saved and asked forgiveness 
from the cave goddess, “Jao Mae Tham,” for the intrusion of pumps, ropes, and people 
during the rescue.
The world rejoiced with the news of the successful rescue. The head of the rescue 
mission said that the cave system would eventually be turned into a living museum 
to highlight how the operation unfolded. As a result of the incident, Thailand’s Navy 
SEALs will include cave diving in their training programs.
On September 7, 2018, the Royal Thai government hosted a reception for all Thai and 
foreign officials and personnel involved in the rescue. His Majesty the King granted a 
royal decoration, The Most Admirable Order of the Direkgunabhorn, to those who were 
involved in the rescue of the football team—114 foreigners and 74 Thais. The order is 
bestowed upon those who render devotional service to the Kingdom of Thailand. The 
title Direkgunabhorn roughly translates as “Noble order of abundance and quality.”
Three months after being rescued, the entire Wild Boars team and coach appeared on the 
U.S. day-time talk show Ellen. Speaking through a translator, the team revealed that four 
of the boys had had birthdays while trapped in the cave. The team and coach were stunned 
when their football hero, Zlatan Ibrahimović, who now plays for the LA Galaxy, made a 
surprise appearance on the show to meet them. The Swedish star high-fived each member. 
“These kids, this team is braver than me and they showed their collective teamwork and had 
patience, faith,” Ibrahimović said. “This is probably the best team in the world.”
1. How did the physical environment of the cave affect the rescue plan?
2. How did the rescue team respond to the risks of the project?
3. Some have called the rescue a miracle and that luck was the decisive factor. Do you 
agree?

Case 8.4
Midnight Sun II Project
Elena Acosta was excited; she was about to begin working on Pacific Tech Univer￾sity’s “Midnight Sun II Project.” Elena was enrolled in PhD program in Geographic 
Sciences and had just completed her course work. She just started working as a 
Research Assistant for Professor Jing Zhão.
Professor Zhão is the lead investigator on a five-year study of the effects of climate 
change on fauna and vegetation in the Arctic Circle. There are six scientists (resources) 
on the team. Due to academic commitments and daylight restrictions in the Arctic, the 
project is scheduled to take 14 weeks beginning May 15 and ending August 31. Zhão 
and a team of scientists completed Midnight Sun I last summer. When they got back to 
Vancouver, the team spent two days conducting a post-project retrospective.1
 The can￾did discussions yielded many valuable lessons that should improve the performance 
on Midnight Sun II.
Given inflation, and the spike in airfare to the Arctic basecamp, Professor Zhão 
knew she had to find ways to cut costs to make up for the deficit in the research grant 
budget. Both the budget and the project schedule were constrained, and Zhão didn’t 
want to scale back on the project.
Elena was hand-picked by Professor Zhão because of her engineering project man￾agement background. Elena used her undergrad engineering degree to work six years 
for the City of Vancouver on a wide range of projects. She split her time between field 
and planning work. Over time she became proficient in the use of MS Project to man￾age projects. This was a scarce skill in Zhão’s team. MS Project was required by the 
Canadian Science Foundation in an effort to control costs and better manage projects. 
Zhão’s team struggled with using MS Project for the first time. Professor Zhão was 
counting on Elena to play a key role in planning the project and more fully utilizing the 
capabilities of the project management software.
Project Midnight Sun II consisted of a battery of experiments conducted at base￾camp and the two satellite mini camps. The project included 11 experiments, ranging 
in duration from 2 to 12 weeks. Some experiments were independent while others had 
to wait for results of previous experiment(s) before starting.
Elena was given the Master schedule that included manpower requirements for 
each of the experiments. The schedule consisted of a network of experiments with the 
critical path being 14 weeks. One of the issues that surfaced during Midnight Sun I 
project retrospective was some of the participants felt that maybe there was too much 
downtime between experiments they were assigned to. They reported using the major￾ity of this time working on their own research. Elena was to use her expertise to explore 
the ramifications.
The table below contains the 14-week experiment schedule for the Midnight Sun 
II project. Each experiment requires two scientists and cannot be interrupted. Utilize 
the information in the table to determine the original resource demands for the project 
over time (i.e., resource demand graph) and assess whether it is possible to reduce the 
number of scientists required to complete the project within 14 weeks. Submit a brief 
document to Professor Zhão documenting your recommendation.

 A project retrospective is when project team reviews the finished project and identify lessons learned as well as other 
relevant issues (discussed in Chapter 14).

Appendix 8.1
The Critical-Chain Approach
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After reading this appendix you should be able to:
A8-1 Define the term critical chain.
A8-2 Identify the reasons projects are late even when estimates are padded.
A8-3 Describe the basic critical-chain methodology.
A8-4 Describe the differences between critical-chain scheduling and the traditional approach to scheduling.
In practice, project managers carefully manage slack on sensitive resource-limited 
projects. If possible, they will add slack at the end of the project by committing to 
a completion date that goes beyond the scheduled date. For example, the plans say 
the project should be completed on April 1, although the official completion date is 
May 1. Other managers take a more aggressive approach to managing slack within the 
schedule. They use an early start schedule and prohibit use of slack on any activity or 
work package to be used unless authorized by the project manager. Progress by per￾cent complete and by remaining time is carefully monitored. Activities that are beating 
estimated completion times are reported so that succeeding activities can start ahead 
of schedule. This ensures that the time gained is used to start a succeeding activity 
earlier and time is not wasted. The overall intent is to create and save slack as a time 
buffer to complete the project early or to cover delay problems that may creep up on 
critical activities or paths.
Eliyahu Goldratt, who championed the “theory of constraints” in his popular book 
The Goal, advocates an alternative approach to managing slack.1
 He has coined the term 
critical chain to recognize that the project network may be constrained by both resource 
and technical dependencies. Each type of constraint can create task dependencies, and in

the case of resource constraints, new task dependencies can be created! Remember how 
resource constraints shifted the critical path? If not, visit Figure 8.5 again. The critical 
chain is the longest string of dependencies that exist on the project. Chain is used 
instead of path, since the latter tends to be associated with just technical dependencies, 
not resource dependencies. Goldratt uses the critical-chain concept to develop strate￾gies for accelerating the completion of projects. These strategies are based on his 
observations about time estimates of individual activities.
TIME ESTIMATES
Goldratt argues that there is a natural tendency for people to add safety (just-in-case) 
time to their estimations. It is believed that those who estimate activity times pro￾vide an estimate that has about an 80 to 90 percent chance of being completed on or 
before the estimated time. Hence, the median time (50/50 chance) is overestimated by 
approximately 30 to 40 percent. For example, a programmer may estimate that there is 
a 50/50 chance that he can complete an activity in six days. However, to ensure success 
and to protect against potential problems, he adds three days of safety time and reports 
that it will take nine days to complete the task. In this case, the median (50/50) time is 
overestimated by approximately 50 percent. He now has a 50/50 chance of completing 
the project three days ahead of schedule. If this hidden contingency is pervasive across 
a project, then most activities in theory should be completed ahead of schedule.
Not only do workers add safety, but project managers like to add safety to ensure 
that they will be able to bring the project in ahead of schedule. They will add a month 
to a nine-month project to cover any delays or risks that might spring up. This situation 
raises an interesting paradox:
Why, if there is a tendency to overestimate activity durations, and add safety to 
the end of a project, do so many projects come in behind schedule?
Critical-Chain Project Management (CCPM) offers several explanations:
∙ Parkinson’s law. Work fills the time available. Why hustle to complete a task today 
when it isn’t due until tomorrow? Not only will the pace of work be dictated by 
deadline, but workers will take advantage of perceived free time to catch up on 
other things. This is especially true in matrix environments where workers will use 
this time to clear work backlog on other projects and duties.
∙ Self-protection. Participants fail to report early finishes out of fear that manage￾ment will adjust their future standards and demand more next time. For example, 
if a team member estimates that a task will take seven days and delivers it in five, 
the next time she is asked for an estimate, the project manager may want to trim 
the estimate based on past performance. Peer pressure may also be a factor here: to 
avoid being labeled a “rate buster,” members might not report early finishes.
∙ Dropped baton. Goldratt uses the metaphor of project as relay race to illustrate the 
impact of poor coordination. Just as a runner’s time is lost if the next runner is not 
ready to receive the baton, so is the time gained from completing a task early lost if 
the next group of people are not ready to receive the project work. Poor communi￾cation and inflexible resource schedules prevent progress from occurring.
∙ Excessive multitasking. The norm in most organizations is to have project personnel 
work on several projects, activities, or assignments at the same time. This leads to 
costly interruptions and excessive task splitting. As pointed out in our discussion of 
splitting tasks, this adds time to each activity. When looked at in isolation the time loss 
may seem minimal, but when taken as a whole the transition costs can be staggering.

∙ Resource bottlenecks. In multiproject organizations, projects are frequently 
delayed because test equipment or other necessary resources are tied up on other 
project work.
∙ Student syndrome (procrastination). Goldratt asserts that just as students delay 
writing a term paper until the last minute, workers delay starting tasks when they 
perceive that they have more than enough time to complete the task. The problem 
with delaying the start of a task is that obstacles are often not detected until the task 
is under way. When the start of the task is postponed, the opportunity to cope with 
these obstacles and complete the task on time is compromised.
Critical Chain in Action
CCPM’s solution to reducing project time overruns is to insist on people using the 
“true 50/50” activity time estimates (rather than estimates that have an 80 to 90 per￾cent chance of being completed before the estimated time); the 50/50 estimates result 
in a project duration about one-half the low risk of 80–90 percent estimates. This 
requires a corporate culture that values accurate estimates and refrains from blaming 
people for not meeting deadlines. According to CCPM, using 50/50 estimates will dis￾courage Parkinson’s law, the student syndrome, and self-protection from coming into 
play because there is less “free time” available. Productivity will be increased as indi￾viduals try to meet tighter deadlines. Similarly, the compressed time schedule reduces 
the likelihood of the dropped baton effect.
CCPM recommends inserting time buffers into the schedule to act as “shock absorb￾ers” to protect the project completion date against task durations taking longer than the 
50/50 estimate. The rationale is that by using 50/50 estimates you are in essence taking 
out all of the “safety” in individual tasks. CCPM also recommends using portions of 
this collective safety strategically by inserting time buffers where potential problems 
are likely to occur. There are three kinds of buffers in CCPM:
∙ Project buffer. First, since all activities along the critical chain have inherent uncer￾tainty that is difficult to predict, project duration is uncertain. Therefore, a project 
time buffer is added to the expected project duration. CCPM recommends using 
roughly 50 percent of the aggregate safety. For example, if the modified schedule 
reduces the project duration by 20 days from 50 to 30, then a 10-day project buffer 
would be used.
∙ Feeder buffers. Buffers are added to the network where noncritical paths merge 
with the critical chain. These buffers protect the critical chain from being delayed.
∙ Resource buffers. Time buffers are inserted where scarce resources are needed for 
an activity. Resource time buffers come in at least two forms. One form is a time 
buffer attached to a critical resource to ensure that the resource is on call and avail￾able when needed. This preserves the relay race. The second form of time buffer 
is added to activities preceding the work of a scarce resource. This kind of buffer 
protects against resource bottlenecks by increasing the likelihood that the preceding 
activity will be completed when the resource is available.
All buffers reduce the risk of the project duration being late and increase the chance 
of early project completion.2

Critical-Chain versus Traditional Scheduling Approach
To illustrate how CCPM affects scheduling, let’s compare it with the traditional 
approach to project scheduling. We will first resolve resource problems in the way 
described in Chapter 8 and then using the CCPM method. Figure A8.1A shows the 
planned Air Control project network without any concern for resources. That is, activ￾ities are assumed to be independent and resources will be made available and/or are 
interchangeable. 
Figure A8.1B depicts the bar chart for the project. The dark blue bars represent the 
durations of critical activities; the light blue bars represent the durations of noncritical 
activities; the gray bars represent slack. Note that the duration is 45 days and the criti￾cal path is represented by activities 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8. 
Parallel activities hold potential for resource conflicts. This is the case in this proj￾ect. Ryan is the resource for activities 3 and 6. If you insert Ryan into the bar chart 
in Figure A8.1B for activities 3 and 6, you can see activity 3 overlaps activity 6 by 
five days—an impossible situation. Because Ryan cannot work two activities simul￾taneously and no other person can take his place, a resource dependency exists. The 
result is that two activities (3 and 6) that were assumed to be independent now become 
dependent. Something has to give! Figure A8.2A shows the Air Control project net￾work with the resources included. A pseudo-dashed arrow has been added to the net￾work to indicate the resource dependency. The bar chart in Figure A8.2B reflects the 
revised schedule resolving the overallocation of Ryan. Given the new schedule, slack

scheduling and the 
traditional approach to 
scheduling.
In the past Spirit Aero Systems, manu￾facturer of airplane parts, was forced 
to delay product development proj￾ects as a result of missing parts for 
assemblies. Spirit management cycled 
through several approaches, such as lean, value chain, 
cycle time reduction, and knowledge-based engineer￾ing, to reduce the problem. Although each yielded 
minor improvements, the impacts were not substantial. 
Rework, overtime, delay costs, and vendor expediting 
costs continued to have significant impact on costs, 
meeting commitments, and reputation. Spirit turned 
to critical-chain management methodology in a pilot 
project.
Joseph Zenisek, the critical-chain manager, said 
the choice of critical chain was “a game changer for 
us.” Spirit applied the critical-chain approach to assem￾bly of newly designed pylons (brackets) used for failure 
destruction testing of casings for a jet engine project. 
Zenisek credited success to three key factors:
• Creating a rule to never start a work package until 
all parts and staff are available.
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE A8.1 Critical Chain Applied to 
Airplane Part Arrivals*
• Ensuring part buffers to cover work packages by 
vigilantly monitoring assembly parts that use a 
large number of parts or where rate or number 
used is high.
• Developing a small engineering team to manage 
vendors and buffers to ensure that delivery of over 
300 parts arrived on time.
The critical-chain program led to impressive results. 
The parts and staffing rule cut down on late deliver￾ies and rework on partially completed work packages 
caused by missing parts. The result was a reduction 
of 50 percent in overtime. Reducing delays reduced 
assembly cycle time by 18 percent. Work in process and 
work packages were also reduced since availability of 
buffer parts avoided delays. The critical-chain method 
led to better resource management and reduced stress.
Given the success of the critical-chain program, 
Spirit intends to expand the application of the critical￾chain method to new product development projects for 
their clients.

for some activities has changed. More importantly, the critical path has changed. It is 
now 1, 3, 6, 7, 8. The resource schedule shows the new project duration to be 50 days 
rather than 45 days. 
Now let’s apply the CCPM approach to the Air Control project. Figure A8.3 details 
many of the changes. First, notice that task estimates now represent approximations 
of the 50/50 rule. Second, observe that not all of the activities on the critical chain 
are technically linked. Manufacture custom parts is included because of previously 
defined resource dependency. Third, a project time buffer is added at the end of 
schedule. Finally, feeder buffers are inserted at each point where a noncritical activity 
merges with the critical chain. 
The impact the CCPM approach has on the project schedule can best be seen in the 
Gantt chart presented in Figure A8.4. Notice first the late start times for each of the 
three noncritical activities. For example, under the critical path method, Order vendor 
parts and Software development would be scheduled to begin immediately after the 
Order review. Instead they are scheduled later in the project. Three-day feeder buffers 
have been added to each of these activities to absorb any delays that might occur in 
these activities. Finally, instead of taking 50 days, the project is now estimated to take 
only 27 days with a 10-day project buffer!

This example provides an opportunity for explaining the differences between buf￾fers and slack. Slack is spare time inherent in the schedule of noncritical activities and 
can be determined by differences between the early start and late start of a specific 
activity. Buffers, on the other hand, are dedicated time blocks reserved to cover most 
likely contingencies and are monitored closely so, if they are not needed, subsequent 
activities can proceed on schedule. Buffers are needed in part because the estimates 
are based on 50/50 approximations, and therefore roughly half of the activities will 
take longer than planned. To protect against these extended activity durations, buffers 
are inserted to minimize the impact on the schedule. Buffers are not part of the project 
schedule and are used only when sound management dictates it.
While not depicted in the figures, an example of a resource buffer would be to 
add six days to Ryan’s schedule (remember, he is the critical resource that caused the 
schedule to be extended). This would ensure that he could continue to work on the 
project beyond the 18th day in case either Produce standard parts or Manufacture cus￾tom parts takes longer than planned. Progress on these two tasks would be monitored 
closely, and his schedule would be adjusted accordingly.
CCPM and Splitting Tasks
Buffers do not address the insidious effects of pervasive task splitting, especially in 
a multiproject environment where workers are juggling different project assignments. 
CCPM has three recommendations that will help reduce the impact of splitting activities:
1. Reduce the number of projects so people are not assigned to as many projects 
concurrently.
2. Control start dates of projects to accommodate resource shortages. Don’t start proj￾ects until sufficient resources are available to work full time on the project.
3. Contract (lock in) for resources before the project begins.
Monitoring Project Performance
The CCPM method uses buffers to monitor project time performance. Remember that 
as shown in Figure A8.3 a project buffer is used to insulate the project against delays 
along the critical chain. For monitoring purposes, this buffer is typically divided into 
three zones—OK, Watch & Plan, and Act, respectively (see Figure A8.5). As the buf￾fer begins to decrease and moves into the second zone, alarms are set off to seek cor￾rective action. To be truly effective, buffer management requires comparing buffer

usage with actual progress on the project. For example, if the project is 75 percent 
complete and you have only used 50 percent of the project buffer, then the project 
is in pretty good shape. Conversely, if the project is only 25 percent complete and 
50 percent of the buffer has already been used, you are in trouble and corrective action 
is needed. A method for estimating percentage complete is described in Chapter 13. 
Success with the CCPM Method
CCPM has generated considerable debate within the project management community. 
While sound in theory, support at this time is limited but growing. For example, Harris 
Semiconductor was able to build a new automated wafer fabrication facility within 
13 months using CCPM methods when the industry standard for such a facility was 
26–36 months. The Israeli aircraft industry has used CCPM techniques to reduce aver￾age maintenance work on aircraft from two months to two weeks. The U.S. Air Force 
and Navy as well as Boeing, Lucent Technologies, Intel, GM, and 3M are applying 
critical-chain principles to their multiproject environments.3
CCPM is not without critics. First, CCPM does not address the biggest cause of 
project delays, which is an ill-defined and unstable project scope. Second, some critics 
challenge Goldratt’s assumptions about human behavior. They question the tendency 
of experts to pad estimates and the fact that employees act deliberately against the 
organization for their own interest and benefit (c.f., Button, 2011; Pinto, 1999). Crit￾ics also object to the insinuation that trained professionals would exhibit the student 
syndrome habits (Zalmanson, 2001). Third, evidence of success is almost exclusively 
anecdotal and based on single case studies or on computer modeling. The lack of sys￾tematic evidence raises questions about generalizability of application. CCPM may 
prove to work best for only certain kinds of projects (Raz, Barnes, & Dvir, 2003).
One of the keys to implementing CCPM is the culture of the organization. If the orga￾nization honors noble efforts that fail to meet estimates as it does efforts that do meet 
estimates, then greater acceptance will occur. Conversely, if management treats honest 
failure differently than success, then resistance will be high. Organizations adopting the 
CCPM approach have to invest significant energy in obtaining “buy-in” on the part of 
all participants to its core principles and allaying the fears that this system may generate.

Case A8.1
The CCPM Dilemma
Achara worked in the IT Department of a diversified IT firm. She was describing the 
firm’s early encounters with critical-chain scheduling to a friend in another IT firm.
Three years ago management decided to add 10 percent time to all activity esti￾mates because almost all projects were coming in late. One thought was people were 
simply working too hard and needed some relief. This approach did not work! Projects 
still came in late. Next, management decided to take away the extra time for activities 
and add 10 percent for project estimates to ensure project durations would be met. 
Again, nothing improved and projects continued to come in late. Recently, the firm 
hired a consultant who promoted critical-chain scheduling, which was implemented 
for all projects in her division. Almost all failed to perform.
Achara explained, “The estimates were basically impossible. The activity durations 
got squeezed down to less than the 50 percent guideline. We were late on nearly every 
task. In addition, I was not allowed to put in a big enough project buffer, which only 
added to projects being late. One colleague who was working on six projects gave up 
and quit; he said he was killing himself and saw no hope of things getting better. My 
projects are not the only ones having big problems. Some people had no idea why 
anyone would use CCPM scheduling. To quote one of my best programmers: “They 
ask for an estimate and then they cut it 50 percent or more. What kind of game is this? 
Apparently they don’t trust us.”
A week later, to Achara’s surprise, she was called to the IT manager’s office. Achara 
imagined numerous bad scenarios of how the meeting would go—even to the remote 
possibility of being fired! The manager wanted the division to straighten out their proj￾ect management practices and stop this business of nearly all IT projects being late. 
There were rumors of cleaning house or outsourcing IT work.
The manager believed that Achara, who passed the PMP exam, had the best chance 
of turning things around. She said, “Achara, I’m nearing the desperate level; top man￾agement is reaching the end of the rope with our division. We need to turn this around 
for both our sakes. Give me a plan that I can sponsor within the week.”
Achara explained to her friend a few of her ideas—like squeezing estimates too far. 
But she said she would take any ideas she could get from anyone.
Give Achara a report that identifies the key problems and a plan of action she can 
present to her sponsor. Limit your report to 800 words or less.

Speed is the ultimate weapon in business. All else being equal, the fastest 
company in any market will win.
—Dave Girouard, CEO and co-founder of Upstart Holdings Inc.
Imagine the following scenarios:
—After finalizing your project schedule, you realize the estimated completion 
date is two months beyond what your boss publicly promised an important 
customer.
—Five months into the project, you realize that you are already three weeks 
behind the drop-dead date for the project.
—Four months into a project, top management changes its priorities and now tells 
you that money is not an issue. Complete the project ASAP!
What do you do?
This chapter addresses strategies for reducing project duration either prior to setting 
the baseline for the project or in the midst of project execution. Choice of options 
is based on the constraints surrounding the project. Here the project priority matrix 
introduced in Chapter 4 comes into play. For example, there are many more options 
available for reducing project time if you are not resource constrained than if you 
cannot spend more than your original budget. We will begin by examining the rea￾sons for reducing project duration, followed by a discussion of different options for 
accelerating project completion. The chapter will conclude with the classic time-cost 
framework for selecting which activities to “crash.” Crash is a term that has emerged 
in the project management lexicon for shortening the duration of an activity or a proj￾ect beyond when it can be normally done.

9.1 Rationale for Reducing Project Duration
There are many good reasons for attempting to reduce the duration of a project. 
One  of the more important reasons today is time-to-market. Intense global compe￾tition and rapid technological advances have made speed a competitive advantage. 
To succeed, companies have to spot new opportunities, launch project teams, and 
bring new products or services to the marketplace in a flash. Perhaps in no other indus￾try does speed matter as much as in high-tech industries. For example, a rule of thumb 
for moderate- to high-technology firms is that a six-month delay in bringing a prod￾uct to market can result in a loss of market share of about 35 percent. In these cases, 
high-technology firms typically assume that the time savings and avoidance of lost 
profits are worth any additional costs to reduce time without any formal analysis. See 
Snapshot from Practice 9.1: Smartphone Wars for more on this.
Business survival depends not only on rapid innovation but also on the ability to 
adapt quickly. The COVID-19 pandemic shocked the world, disrupting every aspect of 
work and daily life. Agile became the battle cry for responding to shifting uncertainties. 
Organizations that responded quickly to challenges as well as seized upon opportunities 
were able to ride the waves of emerging COVID-19 information and predictions. This 
required not only project management but also the ability to adapt quickly.
Another common reason for reducing project time occurs when unforeseen delays—
for example, adverse weather, design flaws, and equipment breakdown—cause 
LO 9-1

reasons for crashing 
a project.
Speed has been critical in business 
ever since the California Gold Rush. 
The smartphone industry is a good 
example of an intensely competi￾tive business that places a premium 
on speed and innovation. Analysts forecast over 
15 different new smartphones on the market in 2025 
with artificial intelligence playing a key role.
Among the new features in development include 
ability to project holographic images, flexible frames 
that allow the phone to be folded, eco-friendly devices, 
and advanced video imaging. Artificial intelligence (AI) 
will continue to be a driving force behind friction-less 
identification, as one’s smartphone becomes more 
trusted than other credential like credit cards and even 
passports. The personal health, entertainment, finan￾cial, and communication possibilities are endless.
In order to survive, Samsung, Apple, Xiaomi, and 
other smartphone manufacturers have become mas￾ters at project management. They have been able 
to cut the market release time of new phones from 
12–18 months to 6–9 months. What is at stake is over 
$1 billion in forecasted sales of new smartphones.

substantial delays midway in the project. Getting back on schedule usually requires 
compressing the time on some of the remaining critical activities. The additional costs 
of getting back on schedule need to be compared with the consequences of being late. 
This is especially true when time is a top priority.
Incentive contracts can make the reduction of project time rewarding—usually for 
both the project contractor and the owner. For example, a contractor finished a bridge 
across a lake 18 months early and received more than $6 million for the early comple￾tion. The availability of the bridge to the surrounding community 18 months early to 
reduce traffic gridlock made the incentive cost to the community seem small to users. 
In another example, in a continuous improvement arrangement, the joint effort of the 
owner and contractor resulted in early completion of a river lock and a 50/50 split of 
the savings to the owner and contractor. See Snapshot from Practice 9.2: Responding 
to the Northridge Earthquake for a classic example of a contractor who went to great 
lengths to quickly complete a project with a big payoff.
“Imposed deadlines” is another reason for accelerating project completion. 
For example, a politician makes a public statement that a new law building will be 
available in two years. Or the president of a software company remarks in a speech 
that new advanced software will be available on January 22. Such statements too often 
become project objectives without any consideration of the problems or cost of meet￾ing such a date. The project duration time is set while the project is in its “concept” 
phase before or without any detailed scheduling of all the activities in the project. This 
phenomenon occurs frequently in practice! Unfortunately, this practice almost always 
leads to a higher-cost project than one that is planned using low-cost and detailed plan￾ning. In addition, quality is sometimes compromised to meet deadlines.
Sometimes very high overhead costs are recognized before the project begins. For 
example, it may cost $80,000 per day to simply house and feed a construction crew in 
the farthest reaches of northern Alaska. In these cases, it is prudent to examine the direct 
costs of shortening the critical path versus the overhead cost savings. Usually there are 
opportunities to shorten a few critical activities at less than the daily overhead rate.
Finally, there are times when it is important to reassign key equipment and/or peo￾ple to new projects. Under these circumstances, the cost of compressing the project 
can be compared with the opportunity costs of not releasing key equipment or people.
9.2 Options for Accelerating Project Completion
Managers have several effective methods for crashing specific project activities when 
resources are not constrained. Several of these are summarized in this section.
Options When Resources Are Not Constrained
Adding Resources
The most common method for shortening project time is to assign additional staff and 
equipment to activities. There are limits, however, as to how much speed can be gained 
by adding staff. Doubling the size of the workforce will not necessarily reduce com￾pletion time by half. The relationship is correct only when tasks can be partitioned so 
minimal communication is needed between workers, as in harvesting a crop by hand or 
repaving a highway. Most projects are not set up that way; additional workers increase 
the communication requirements to coordinate their efforts. For example, doubling a 
team by adding two workers requires six times as much pairwise intercommunication 
than is required in the original two-person team. Not only is more time needed to coor￾dinate and manage a larger team but also there is the additional delay of training the

new people and getting them up to speed on the project. The end result is captured in 
Brooks’s law: adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.1
Frederick Brooks formulated this principle based on his experience as a project 
manager for IBM’s System/360 software project during the early 1960s. Although 
subsequent research confirmed Brooks’s prediction, it also discovered that adding 
more people to a late project does not always cause the project to be later.2

On January 17, 1994, a 6.8-magnitude 
earthquake struck the Los Angeles 
basin, near suburban Northridge, 
causing 60 deaths, thousands of inju￾ries, and billions of dollars in property 
damage. Nowhere was the destructive power of nature 
more evident than in the collapsed sections of the free￾way system, disrupting the daily commute of an esti￾mated 1 million Los Angelenos.
The Northridge earthquake posed one of the great￾est challenges to the California Department of Trans￾portation (CalTrans) in its nearly 100-year history. To 
expedite the recovery process, Governor Pete Wilson 
signed an emergency declaration allowing CalTrans 
to streamline contracting procedures and offer attrac￾tive incentives for completing work ahead of schedule. 
For each day that the schedule was beaten, a sizable 
bonus was to be awarded. Conversely, for each day 
over the deadline, the contractor would be penalized 
the same amount. The amount ($50,000 to $200,000) 
varied depending on the importance of the work.
The incentive scheme proved to be a powerful 
motivator for the freeway reconstruction contractors. 
C. C. Myers, Inc., of Rancho Cordova, California, won 
the contract for the reconstruction of the Interstate 
10 bridges. Myers pulled out all the stops to finish the 
project in a blistering 66 days—a whopping 74 days 
ahead of schedule—and earning a $14.8 million bonus! 
Myers took every opportunity to save time and stream￾line operations. They greatly expanded the workforce. 
For example, 134 iron-workers were employed instead 
of the normal 15. Special lighting equipment was set 
up so that work could be performed around the clock. 
Likewise, the sites were prepared and special materi￾als were used so that work could continue despite 
inclement weather that would normally shut down 
construction. The work was scheduled much like an 
assembly line so that critical activities were followed by 
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 9.2 Responding to the Northridge 
Earthquake*
the next critical activity. A generous incentive scheme 
was devised to reward teamwork and reach milestones 
early. Carpenters and iron-workers competed as teams 
against each other to see who could finish first.
Although C. C. Myers received a substantial bonus 
for finishing early, they spent a lot of money on overtime, 
bonuses, special equipment, and other premiums to 
keep the job rolling along. CalTrans supported Myers’s 
efforts. With reconstruction work going on 24  hours 
a day, including jackhammering and pile-driving, Cal￾Trans temporarily housed many families in local motels. 
CalTrans even erected a temporary plastic soundwall 
to help reduce the construction noise traveling to a 
nearby apartment complex. The double-layer cur￾tain, 450 feet long and 20 feet high, was designed to 
reduce construction noise by 10 decibels.
Despite the difficulties and expense incurred by 
around-the-clock freeway building, most of Los Ange￾les cheered CalTrans’s quake recovery efforts. The 
Governor’s Office of Planning and Research issued a 
report concluding that for every day the Santa Monica 
Freeway was closed, it cost the local economy more 
than $1 million.

is whether the new staff is added early so there is sufficient time to make up for lost 
ground once the new members have been fully assimilated.
Outsourcing Project Work
A common method for shortening project time is to subcontract an activity. The sub￾contractor may have access to superior technology or expertise that will accelerate 
the completion of the activity. For example, contracting for a backhoe can accomplish 
in two hours what it can take a team of laborers two days to do. Likewise, by hiring 
a consulting firm that specializes in Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) pro￾gramming, a firm may be able to cut in half the time it would take for less experienced, 
internal programmers to do the work. Subcontracting also frees up resources that can 
be assigned to a critical activity and will ideally result in a shorter project duration. 
See Snapshot from Practice 9.3: Outsourcing in Bio-Tech Picks Up Speed. Outsourc￾ing will be addressed more fully in Chapter 12.
Scheduling Overtime
The easiest way to add more labor to a project is not to add more people but to sched￾ule overtime. If a team works 50 hours a week instead of 40, it might accomplish 20 
percent more. By scheduling overtime, you avoid the additional costs of coordination 
and communication encountered when new people are added. If people involved are 
salaried workers, there may be no additional cost for the extra work. Another advan￾tage is that there are fewer distractions when people work outside normal hours.
Overtime has disadvantages. First, hourly workers are typically paid time and a half 
for overtime and double time for weekends and holidays. Sustained overtime work by 
salaried employees may incur intangible costs such as divorce, burnout, and turnover. 
Turnover is a key organizational concern when there is a shortage of workers. Further￾more, it is an oversimplification to assume that over an extended period of time a per￾son is as productive during her eleventh hour at work as during her third hour of work. 
There are natural limits to what is humanly possible, and extended overtime may actu￾ally lead to an overall decline in productivity when fatigue sets in (DeMarco, 2002).
In the face of increasing time-to￾market pressures, many bio-tech 
firms are turning to outsourcing to 
expedite the drug development pro￾cess. Panos Kalaritis, vice president 
of operations for Irix Pharmaceuticals, says that out￾sourcing process development can accelerate a drug’s 
evolution by allowing a pharmaceutical company to 
continue research while a contractor works on process 
optimization. Susan Dexter of Lonza Biologics identi￾fied different types of outsourcing contracts including 
agreements for product development, clinical trial 
supplies, in-market or commercial supplies, and tech￾nology transfer. Often, she said, a given project can 
encompass more than one of the above stages over a 
period of several years.
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 9.3 Outsourcing in Bio-Tech Picks 
Up Speed*
Using a contractor, said Paul Henricks, business 
manager for Patheon Inc., gives the client company 
access to specialized knowledge and infrastructure as 
well as flexible resources and capacity. The sponsoring 
company can also manage risks by sharing responsi￾bilities through outsourcing.
“Communication is key to a successful outsourcing 
relationship,” said Dan Gold, vice president of process 
development for Covance, which was formerly Corn￾ing Bio. “Contractors and sponsors should both assign 
project managers, and the two must work together 
to maintain, track, and document project completion. 
There must be a concerted effort on the part of both 
parties to work as partners to complete the project.”

Working overtime and longer hours is the preferred choice for accelerating project 
completion, especially when the project team is salaried. The key is to use overtime 
judiciously. Remember, a project is a marathon, not a sprint! You do not want to run 
out of energy before the finish line.
Establish a Core Project Team
As discussed in Chapter 3, one of the advantages of creating a dedicated core team 
to complete a project is speed. Assigning professionals full time to a project avoids 
the hidden cost of multitasking in which people are forced to juggle the demands of 
multiple projects. Professionals are allowed to devote their undivided attention to a 
specific project. This singular focus creates a shared goal that can bind a diverse set of 
professionals into a highly cohesive team capable of accelerating project completion. 
Factors that contribute to the emergence of high-performing project teams will be dis￾cussed in detail in Chapter 11.
Do It Twice—Fast and Correctly
If you are in a hurry, try building a “quick and dirty” short-term solution; then go back 
and do it the right way. For example, pontoon bridges are used as temporary solutions to 
damaged bridges in combat. In business, software companies are notorious for releas￾ing version 1.0 of products that are not completely finished and tested. Subsequent 
versions 1.1 . . . x correct bugs and add intended functionality to the product. The 
additional costs of doing it twice are often more than compensated for by the benefits 
of satisfying the deadline.
Options When Resources Are Constrained
A project manager has fewer options for accelerating project completion when addi￾tional resources are not available or the budget is severely constrained. This is espe￾cially true once the schedule has been established. This section discusses some of 
these options, which are also available when resources are not constrained.
Improve the Efficiency of the Project Team
The project team may be able to improve productivity by implementing more efficient 
ways to do their work. This can be achieved by improving the planning and organiza￾tion of the project or eliminating barriers to productivity such as excessive bureau￾cratic interference and red tape.
Fast Tracking
Sometimes it is possible to rearrange the logic of the project network so that critical 
activities are done in parallel (concurrently) rather than sequentially. This alternative 
is commonly referred to as fast tracking and is a good one if the project situation is 
right. When this alternative is given serious attention, it is amazing to observe how cre￾ative project team members can be in finding ways to restructure sequential activities 
in parallel. As noted in Chapter 6, one of the most common methods for restructuring 
activities is to change a finish-to-start relationship to a start-to-start relationship. For 
example, instead of waiting for the final design to be approved, manufacturing engi￾neers can begin building the production line as soon as key specifications have been 
established. Changing activities from sequential to parallel is not without risk, how￾ever. Late design changes can produce wasted effort and rework. Fast tracking requires 
close coordination among those responsible for the activities affected and confidence 
in the work that has been completed.

December 17, 
2002—after 
revving up 
their power 
tools and 
lining up volunteers, Shelby 
County Habitat for Humanity 
broke the world record for the 
fastest house ever built, clock￾ing in at 3 hours, 26 minutes, 
and 34 seconds. Former 
record holder, New Zealand’s 
Habitat Affiliate Mannakau, 
held the record for three years 
at 3 hours, 44 minutes, and 
59 seconds. The Alabama 
project beat the New Zealand 
record by 18 minutes.
“This was different than any construction project 
that I’ve ever been a part of,” said Project Manager 
Chad Calhoun. “The minute-by-minute schedule, the 
planning of each precise movement, the organization 
of all the teams and materials, could not have gone 
more smoothly on build day. All the long hours of plan￾ning definitely paid off.”
In preparation for the build, Habitat volunteers put 
the foundation in place and constructed prefabricated 
wall panels. Once the whistle blew at 11:00 a.m. on 
December 17, the exterior wall panels were raised 
into place, followed by the interior panel, which took 
only 16 minutes. Special color-coded teams of work￾ers connected the wiring and plumbing, put in insula￾tion, installed appliances, laid carpet and tile, installed 
light fixtures, painted the house inside, applied vinyl 
siding outside, and attached assembled front and 
back porches.
At the same time, the roof was constructed on 
the ground next to the house. Once the roof was 
completed—approximately 1½ hours later—a Steel 
City crane lifted the 14,000-pound roof assembly into 
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 9.4 The Fastest House in the World*
place. Crews attached the roof while others completed 
the interior work. There was even time to lay sod, 
plant shrubbery, and decorate a Christmas tree in the 
front yard—all within the official build time of 3 hours, 
26 minutes, and 34 seconds.
The recipient of this wonderful holiday gift was 
Bonnie Lilly, a single mother and nursing technician 
who had applied to Habitat for Humanity three times 
before she was selected to receive the three-bedroom, 
two-bath home. “It’s amazing,” Lilly said. “Who am I to 
have this happen for me? A world record, hundreds of 
people coming together to build my house—I still can’t 
believe it.”

organization that builds simple, affordable houses 
and sells them on a no-interest, no-profit basis to 
needy families.

Use Critical-Chain Management
Critical-Chain Project Management (CCPM) is designed to accelerate project comple￾tion. As discussed in Appendix 8.1, it would be difficult to apply CCPM midstream in 
a project. CCPM requires considerable training and a shift in habits and perspectives 
that takes time to adopt. Although there have been reports of immediate gains, espe￾cially in terms of completion times, a long-term management commitment is probably 
necessary to reap full benefits. See Snapshot from Practice 9.4: The Fastest House in 
the World for an extreme example of CCPM application.

lar60886_ch09_326-362.indd 334 09/06/23 09:11 am
Reduce Project Scope
Probably the most common response to meeting unattainable deadlines is to reduce 
the scope of the project. This invariably leads to a reduction in the functionality of the 
project. For example, a new car will average only 25 mpg instead of 30, or a software 
product will have fewer features than originally planned. While scaling back the scope 
of the project can lead to big savings in both time and money, it may come at a cost of 
reducing the value of the project. If the car gets lower gas mileage, will it stand up to 
competitive models? Will customers still want the software minus the features?
The key to reducing project scope without reducing value is to reassess the true 
specifications of the project. Often requirements are added under best-case, blue-sky 
scenarios and represent desirables, but not essentials. Here it is important to talk to the 
customer and/or project sponsors and explain the situation—“you can get it your way 
but not until February.” This may force them to accept an extension or to add money 
to expedite the project. If not, then a healthy discussion of what the essential require￾ments are and what items can be compromised in order to meet the deadline needs 
to take place. More intense reexamination of requirements may actually improve the 
value of the project by getting it done more quickly and for a lower cost.
Compromise Quality
Reducing quality is always an option, but it is rarely acceptable or used. Sacrificing 
quality may reduce the time of an activity on the critical path.
In practice the methods most commonly used to crash projects are scheduling over￾time, outsourcing, and adding resources. Each of these maintains the essence of the 
original plan. Options that depart from the original project plan include do it twice and 
fast tracking. Rethinking of project scope, customer needs, and timing become major 
considerations for these techniques.
See Snapshot from Practice: Operation Warp Speed for an account of the U.S. gov￾ernment efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine as quickly as possible.
9.3 Project Cost-Duration Graph
Nothing on the horizon suggests that the need to shorten project time will change. 
In fact, if anything, the pressure to get projects done quicker and sooner is likely to 
increase in importance. The challenge for the project manager is to use a quick, logi￾cal method to compare the benefits of reducing project time with the costs involved. 
Without sound, logical methods, it is difficult to isolate those activities that will have 
the greatest impact on reducing project time at least cost. This section describes a 
procedure for identifying the costs of reducing project time so that comparisons can be 
made with the benefits of getting the project completed sooner. The method requires 
gathering direct and indirect costs for specific project durations. Critical activities are 
searched to find the lowest direct-cost activities that will shorten the project duration. 
Total costs for specific project durations are computed and then compared with the 
benefits of reducing project time—before the project begins or while it is in progress.
Explanation of Project Costs
The general nature of project costs is illustrated in Figure 9.1, which shows a project 
cost-duration graph. The total cost for each duration is the sum of the indirect and 
direct costs. Indirect costs continue for the life of the project. Hence, any reduction in 
project duration means a reduction in indirect costs. Direct costs on the graph grow

On May 15, 2020, the Trump admin￾istration launched Operation Warp 
Speed to develop vaccines against 
the deadly COVID-19. The name was 
inspired by terminology for faster￾than-light travel used in the Star Trek fictional universe, 
evoking a sense of rapid progress. Operation Warp 
Speed was formed to encourage private and public 
partnerships to enable faster approval and production 
of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Specific targets, as outlined in various media, 
included:
1. Support pharmaceutical companies for R&D of 
seven different vaccine candidates simultaneously 
and certain therapeutic compounds.
2. Support several vaccine manufacturers for rapid 
scale-up of manufacturing capacity.
3. Support organization and facilitate simultane￾ous Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review 
of Phase I–III clinical trials on several of the most 
promising vaccine candidates.
4. Facilitate manufacturing vaccine candidates while 
they remain pre-approved during prefinal clinical 
research to prepare for rapid deployment, if proven 
to be safe and effective.
5. Coordinate with the Department of Defense for 
vaccine supply, production, and deployment 
around the United States, and track every vaccine 
vial and the injection schedule for each American 
receiving a vaccination.
According to the Department of Health and Human 
Services’ fact sheet, the main stated goal of Operation 
Warp Speed was to “produce and deliver 300 million 
doses of safe and effective vaccines with the initial 
doses available by January 2021.”

Clearly cost was not a priority. The U.S. congress 
quickly authorized billions of dollars be spent on sup￾porting joint efforts by government and businesses 
to rapidly deliver a viable vaccine to the public. The 
funds not only dramatically increased the number of 
people searching for solutions but also allow firms to 
broaden their search for solutions not normally con￾sidered. Hoping to strike a “gold.” At one time over 
145 different vaccines were being tested worldwide.
FDA streamlined the approval process by ini￾tiating Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) proce￾dures. Both Pfizer and Moderna were issued EUAs 
in December 2020 that accelerated their approval 
deadlines.
On June 30, 2020, the FDA announced that a vac￾cine would need to be at least 50% effective for dimin￾ishing the severity of COVID-19 symptoms to obtain 
regulatory and marketing approval. It should be noted 
that normal flu vaccines have 40–60% efficacy.
Investments extended beyond pharmaceutical 
firms to include the entire network of business required 
to manufacture and deliver vaccines including both 
UPS and FedEx. Fast tracking (aka, Start to Start lags) 
were used to shorten delivery times by building manu￾facturing and distribution systems before vaccine 
approval.
While Operation Warp Speed fell short of its Janu￾ary 2021 target, it did pave the way for the rapid 
distribution of vaccines to American public. Future 
retrospectives will ultimately assess the efficacy of 
the operation in general and the projects that were 
attempted. More critical will be the lessons learned 
developed by people at all levels of operations.

at an increasing rate as the project duration is reduced from its originally planned 
duration. With the information from a graph such as this for a project, managers can 
quickly judge any alternative such as meeting a time-to-market deadline. Further dis￾cussion of indirect and direct costs is necessary before demonstrating a procedure for 
developing the information for a graph similar to the one in Figure 9.1.
Project Indirect Costs
Indirect costs generally represent overhead costs such as supervision, administration, 
consultants, and interest. Indirect costs cannot be associated with any particular work

package or activity, hence the term. Indirect costs vary directly with time. That is, any 
reduction in time should result in a reduction of indirect costs. For example, if the 
daily costs of supervision, administration, and consultants are $2,000, any reduction 
in project duration would represent a savings of $2,000 per day. If indirect costs are a 
significant percentage of total project costs, reductions in project time can represent 
very real savings (assuming the indirect resources can be utilized elsewhere).
Project Direct Costs
Direct costs commonly represent labor, materials, equipment, and sometimes sub￾contractors. Direct costs are assigned directly to a work package and activity, hence 
the term. The ideal assumption is that direct costs for an activity time represent nor￾mal costs, which typically mean low-cost, efficient methods for a normal time. When 
project durations are imposed, direct costs may no longer represent low-cost, efficient 
methods. Costs for the imposed duration date will be higher than for a project duration 
developed from ideal normal times for activities. Because direct costs are assumed to 
be developed from normal methods and time, any reduction in activity time should 
add to the costs of the activity. The sum of the costs of all the work packages or activi￾ties represents the total direct costs for the project.
The major challenge faced in creating the information for a graph similar to 
Figure 9.1 is computing the direct cost of shortening individual critical activities and 
then finding the total direct cost for each project duration as project time is compressed; 
the process requires selecting those critical activities that cost the least to shorten. 
(Note: The graph implies that there is always an optimum cost-time point. This is 
only true if shortening a schedule has incremental indirect cost savings exceeding the 
incremental direct cost incurred. However, in practice there are almost always several 
activities in which the direct costs of shortening are less than the indirect costs.)

9.4 Constructing a Project Cost-Duration Graph
Three major steps are required to construct a project cost-duration graph:
1. Find total direct costs for selected project durations.
2. Find total indirect costs for selected project durations.
3. Sum direct and indirect costs for these selected durations.
The graph is then used to compare additional cost alternatives for benefits. Details of 
these steps are presented here.
Determining the Activities to Shorten
The most difficult task in constructing a cost-duration graph is finding the total 
direct costs for specific project durations over a relevant range. The central task is 
to decide which activities to shorten and how far to carry the shortening process. 
Basically managers need to look for critical activities that can be shortened with 
the smallest increase in cost per unit of time. The rationale for selecting critical 
activities depends on identifying the activity’s normal and crash times and corre￾sponding costs. Normal time for an activity represents low-cost, realistic, efficient 
methods for completing the activity under normal conditions. The shortest possible 
time in which an activity can realistically be completed is called its crash time.
The direct cost for completing an activity in its crash time is called crash cost. Both 
normal and crash times and costs are collected from the personnel most familiar 
with completing the activity. Figure 9.2 depicts a hypothetical cost-duration graph 
for an activity. 
The normal time for the activity in Figure 9.2 is 10 time units, and the corre￾sponding cost is $400. The crash time for the activity is five time units and $800.

The intersection of the normal time and cost represents the original low-cost, 
early-start schedule. The  crash point represents the maximum time an activity 
can  be  compressed. The heavy line connecting the normal and crash points rep￾resents the slope, which assumes that the cost of reducing the time of the activity 
is constant per unit of time. The assumptions underlying the use of this graph are 
as follows:
1. The cost-time relationship is linear.
2. Normal time assumes low-cost, efficient methods to complete the activity.
3. Crash time represents a limit—the greatest time reduction possible under realistic 
conditions.
4. Slope represents cost per unit of time.
5. All accelerations must occur within the normal and crash times.
Knowing the slope of activities allows managers to compare which critical activi￾ties to shorten. The less steep the cost slope of an activity, the less it costs to 
shorten one time period; a steeper slope means it will cost more to shorten one 
time unit. The cost per unit of time or slope for any activity is computed by the 
following equation:
Cost slope = Rise
____
Run = Crash cost − Normal cost _____________________ Normal time − Crash time
= CC − NC ________
NT − CT = $800 − $400 __________
10 − 5 
= $400 _____
5 = $80 per unit of time
In Figure 9.2, the rise is the y-axis (cost) and the run is the x-axis (duration). The 
slope of the cost line is $80 for each time unit the activity is reduced; the limit reduc￾tion of the activity time is five time units. Comparison of the slopes of all critical 
activities allows us to determine which activity(ies) to shorten to minimize total direct 
cost. Given the preliminary project schedule (or one in progress) with all activities set 
to their early-start times, the process of searching critical activities as candidates for 
reduction can begin. The total direct cost for each specific compressed project dura￾tion must be found.
A Simplified Example
Figure 9.3A presents normal and crash times and costs for each activity, the computed 
slope and time reduction limit, the total direct cost, and the project network with a 
duration of 25 time units. Note that the total direct cost for the 25-period duration is 
$450. This is an anchor point to begin the procedure of shortening the critical path(s) 
and finding the total direct costs for each specific duration less than 25 time units. The 
maximum time reduction of an activity is simply the difference between the normal 
and crash times for an activity. For example, activity D can be reduced from a normal

The network shows the critical path to be activities A, D, F, G. Because it is impossible 
to shorten activity G (“x” is used to indicate this), activity A is circled because it is the 
least-cost candidate; that is, its slope ($20) is less than the slopes for activities D and F 
($25 and $30). Reducing activity A 1 time unit cuts the project duration to 24 time units

but increases the total direct costs to $470 ($450 + $20 = $470). Figure 9.3B reflects 
these changes. The duration of activity A has been reduced to 2 time units; the “x” indi￾cates the activity cannot be reduced any further. Activity D is circled because it costs the 
least ($25) to shorten the project to 23 time units. Compare the cost of activity F. The 
total direct cost for a project duration of 23 time units is $495 (see Figure 9.4A). 
Observe that the project network in Figure  9.4A now has two critical paths—
A, C, F, G and A, D, F, G. Reducing the project to 22 time units will require that 
activity F be reduced; thus, it is circled. This change is reflected in Figure 9.4B. The 
total direct cost for 22 time units is $525. This reduction has created a third critical 
path—A, B, E, G; all activities are critical. Note that we can also reduce the project 
duration from 23 time units to 22 time units by crashing activities C and D together. 
We do not select this alternate because it costs more to reduce activities C and D 
than to reduce activity F only. Reducing activities C and D will cost $55 ($30 + $25) 
while reducing activity F costs $30 only.
The least-cost method for reducing the project duration to 21 time units is the com￾bination of the circled activities C, D, E—which cost $30, $25, $30, respectively—
and increase total direct costs to $610. The results of these changes are depicted in

Figure 9.4C. Although some activities can still be reduced (those without the “x” next 
to the activity time), no activity or combination of activities will result in a reduction 
in the project duration.
With the total direct costs for the array of specific project durations found, the next 
step is to collect the indirect costs for the same durations. These costs are typically 
a rate per day and are easily obtained from the Accounting Department. Figure 9.5 
presents the total direct costs, total indirect costs, and total project costs. The same 
costs are plotted in Figure 9.6. This graph shows that the optimum cost-time duration 
is 22 time units and $775. Assuming the project will actually materialize as planned, 
any movement away from this time duration will increase project costs. The movement 
from 25 to 22 time units occurs because, in this range, the absolute slopes of the indi￾rect costs are greater than the direct-cost slopes.
9.5 Practical Considerations
Using the Project Cost-Duration Graph
The project cost-duration graph, as presented in Figures 9.1 and 9.6, is valuable 
in comparing any proposed alternative or change with the optimum cost and time. 
More importantly the creation of such a graph keeps the importance of indirect costs

in the forefront of decision making. Indirect costs are frequently forgotten in the field 
when the pressure for action is intense. Finally, such a graph can be used before the 
project begins or while the project is in progress.
Creating the graph in the pre-project planning phase without an imposed duration 
is the first choice because normal time is more meaningful. Creating the graph in the 
project planning phase with an imposed duration is less desirable because normal time 
is made to fit the imposed date and is probably not low cost. Creating the graph after 
the project has started is the least desirable because some alternatives may be ruled out 
of the decision process. Managers may choose not to use the formal procedure demon￾strated. However, regardless of the method used, the principles and concepts inherent 
in the formal procedure are highly applicable in practice and should be considered in 
any cost-duration trade-off decision.
Crash Times
Collecting crash times for even a moderate-sized project can be difficult. The meaning 
of crash time is difficult to communicate. What is meant when you define crash time 
as “the shortest time you can realistically complete an activity”? Crash time is open 
to different interpretations and judgments. Some estimators feel very uncomfortable 
providing crash times. Regardless of the comfort level, the accuracy of crash times and 
costs is frequently rough at best, when compared with normal time and cost.
Linearity Assumption
Because the accuracy of compressed activity times and costs is questionable, the con￾cern of some theorists—that the relationship between cost and time is not linear but 
curvilinear—is seldom a concern for practicing managers. Reasonable, quick com￾parisons can be made using the linear assumption.3
 The simple approach is adequate 
for most projects. There are rare situations in which activities cannot be crashed by 
single time units. Instead, crashing is “all or nothing.” For example, activity A will 
take 10 days (for, say, $1,000) or it will take 7 days (for, say, $1,500), but no options 
exist in which activity A will take 8 or 9 days to complete. In a few, rare cases of very 
large, complex, long-duration projects, present value techniques may be useful; such 
techniques are beyond the scope of this text.
Choice of Activities to Crash Revisited
The cost-time crashing method relies on choosing the cheapest method for reducing the 
duration of the project. There are other factors that should be assessed beyond simply 
cost. First, the inherent risks involved in crashing particular activities need to be con￾sidered. Some activities are riskier to crash than others. For example, accelerating the 
completion of a software design code may not be wise if it increases the likelihood of 
errors surfacing downstream. Conversely, crashing a more expensive activity may be 
wise if fewer inherent risks are involved.
Second, the timing of activities needs to be considered. Crashing an early activity 
may be prudent if there is concern that subsequent activities are likely to be delayed, 
and absorb the time gained. Then the manager would still have the option of crashing 
final activities to get back on schedule.
Third, crashing frequently results in overallocation of resources. The resources required 
to accelerate a cheaper activity may suddenly not be available. Resource availability, 
not cost, may dictate which activities are crashed.

 Linearity assumes that the cost for crashing each time unit is constant.

Finally, the impact of crashing would have on the morale and motivation of the 
project team needs to be assessed. If the least-cost method repeatedly signals a sub￾group to accelerate progress, fatigue and resentment may set in. Conversely, if overtime 
pay is involved, other team members may resent not having access to this benefit. This 
situation can lead to tension within the entire project team. Good project managers 
gauge the response that crashing activities will have on the entire project  team. 
See Snapshot from Practice 9.5: I’ll Bet You . . . for a novel approach to motivating 
employees to work faster.
The focus of this chapter has been on 
how project managers crash activi￾ties by typically assigning additional 
manpower and equipment to cut sig￾nificant time off of scheduled tasks. 
Project managers often encounter situations in which 
they need to motivate individuals to accelerate the 
completion of a specific, critical task. Imagine the fol￾lowing scenario.
Bruce Young just received a priority assignment 
from corporate headquarters. The preliminary engi￾neering sketches that were due tomorrow need to be 
e-mailed to the West Coast by 4:00 p.m. today so that 
the model shop can begin construction of a prototype 
to present to top management. Bruce approaches 
Danny Whitten, the draftsman responsible for the task, 
whose initial response is “That’s impossible!” While 
Bruce agrees that it would be very difficult, he does not 
believe that it is as impossible as Danny suggests or 
that Danny truly believes that. What should he do?
He tells Danny that he knows this is going to be 
a rush job but he is confident that he can do it. When 
Danny balks, he responds, “I tell you what, I’ll make 
a bet with you. If you are able to finish the design by 
4:00, I’ll make sure you get two of the  company’s 
tickets to tomorrow night’s Celtics-Knicks basketball 
game.” Danny accepts the challenge, works feverishly 
to complete the assignment, and is able to take his 
daughter to her first professional basketball game.
Conversations with project managers reveal that 
many use bets like this one to motivate extraordinary 
performance. These bets range from tickets to sport￾ing and entertainment events to gift certificates at 
high-class restaurants to a well-deserved afternoon 
off. For bets to work, they need to adhere to the prin￾ciples of expectancy theory of motivation.* Boiled 
down to simple terms, expectancy theory rests on 
three key questions:
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 9.5 I’II Bet You . . .
1. Can I do it (is it possible to meet the challenge)?
2. Will I get it (can I demonstrate that I met the chal￾lenge and can I trust the project manager will 
deliver his/her end of the bargain)?
3. Is it worth it (is the payoff of sufficient personal 
value to warrant the risk and extra effort)?
If in the mind of the participant the answer to any of 
these three questions is no, then the person is unlikely 
to accept the challenge. However, when the answers 
are affirmative, then the individual is likely to accept 
the challenge.
Bets can be effective motivational tools and add an 
element of excitement and fun to project work. But the 
following practical advice should be heeded:
1. The bet has greater significance if it also benefits 
family members or significant others. Being able to 
take a son or daughter to a professional basketball 
game allows that individual to “score points” at 
home through work. These bets also recognize and 
reward the support project members receive from 
their families and reinforces the importance of their 
work to loved ones.
2. Bets should be used sparingly; otherwise, every￾thing can become negotiable. They should be 
used only under special circumstances that require 
extraordinary effort.
3. Individual bets should involve clearly recogniz￾able  individual effort; otherwise, others may 
become jealous and discord may occur. As long as 
others see it as requiring truly remarkable, “beyond 
the call of duty” effort, they will consider it fair and 
warranted.
*Expectancy theory is considered one of the major theories of 
human motivation and was first developed by V. H. Vroom in 
Work and Motivation (New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1964).

Time Reduction Decisions and Sensitivity
Should the project owner or project manager go for the optimum cost-time? The answer 
is “It depends.” Risk must be considered. Recall from our example that the optimum 
project time point represented a reduced project cost and was less than the original 
normal project time (review Figure 9.6). The project direct-cost line near the normal 
point is usually relatively flat. Because indirect costs for the project are usually greater 
in the same range, the optimum cost-time point is less than the normal time point. 
Logic of the cost-time procedure suggests managers should reduce the project duration 
to the lowest total cost point and duration.
How far to reduce the project time from the normal time toward the optimum 
depends on the sensitivity of the project network. A network is sensitive if it has several 
critical or near-critical paths. In our example, project movement toward the optimum 
time requires spending money to reduce critical activities, resulting in slack reduction 
and/or more critical paths and activities. Slack reduction in a project with several near￾critical paths increases the risk of being late. The practical outcome can be a higher 
total project cost if some near-critical activities are delayed and become critical; the 
money spent reducing activities on the original critical path would be wasted. Sensi￾tive networks require careful analysis. The bottom line is that the compression of proj￾ects with several near-critical paths reduces scheduling flexibility and increases the 
risk of delaying the project. The outcome of such analysis will probably suggest only a 
partial movement from the normal time toward the optimum time.
There is a positive situation where moving toward the optimum time can result in 
large savings—this occurs when the network is insensitive. A project network is insen￾sitive if it has a dominant critical path, that is, no near-critical paths. In this project 
circumstance, movement from the normal time point toward the optimum time will not
create new or near-critical activities. The bottom line here is that the reduction of the 
slack of noncritical activities increases the risk of their becoming critical only slightly 
when compared with the effect in a sensitive network. Insensitive networks hold the 
greatest potential for real, sometimes large, savings in total project costs with a mini￾mum risk of noncritical activities becoming critical.
Insensitive networks are not a rarity in practice; they occur in perhaps 25 percent of all 
projects. For example, a light rail project team observed from their network a dominant 
critical path and relatively high indirect costs. It soon became clear that by spending 
some dollars on a few critical activities, very large savings of indirect costs could be 
realized. Savings of several million dollars were spent extending the rail line and adding 
another station. The logic found in this example is just as applicable to small projects as 
to large ones. Insensitive networks with high indirect costs can produce large savings.
Ultimately, deciding if and which activities to crash is a judgment call requiring 
careful consideration of the options available, the costs and risks involved, and the 
importance of meeting a deadline.
9.6 What If Cost, Not Time, Is the Issue?
In today’s fast-paced world, there appears to be a greater emphasis on getting things 
done quickly. Still, organizations are always looking for ways to get things done 
cheaply. This is especially true for fixed-bid projects, where profit margin is derived 
from the difference between the bid and the actual cost of the project. Every dollar 
saved is a dollar in your pocket. Sometimes, in order to secure a contract, bids are 
tight, which puts added pressure on cost containment. In other cases, there are finan￾cial incentives tied to cost containment.

Even in situations where cost is transferred to customers, there is pressure to reduce 
cost. Cost overruns make for unhappy customers and can damage future business 
opportunities. Budgets can be fixed or cut, and when contingency funds are exhausted, 
cost overruns have to be made up with remaining activities.
As discussed earlier, shortening project duration may come at the expense of work￾ing overtime, adding additional personnel, and using more expensive equipment and/
or materials. Conversely, sometimes cost savings can be generated by extending the 
duration of a project. This may allow for a smaller workforce, less-skilled (expensive) 
labor, and even cheaper equipment and materials to be used. Discussed in this section 
are some of the more commonly used options for cutting costs.
Reduce Project Scope
Just as scaling back the scope of the project can gain time, delivering less than what was 
originally planned also produces significant savings. Again, calculating the savings of 
a reduced project scope begins with the work breakdown structure. However, since 
time is not the issue, you do not need to focus on critical activities. For example, on 
over-budget movie projects it is not uncommon to replace location shots with stock 
footage to cut costs.
Have Owner Take on More Responsibility
One way of reducing project costs is identifying tasks that customers can do them￾selves. Homeowners frequently use this method to reduce costs on home improve￾ment projects. For example, to reduce the cost of a bathroom remodel, a homeowner 
may agree to paint the room instead of paying the contractor to do it. On IS projects, 
a customer may agree to take on some of the responsibility for testing equipment or 
providing in-house training. Naturally this arrangement is best negotiated before the 
project begins. Customers are less receptive to this idea if you suddenly spring it on 
them. An advantage of this method is that, while costs are lowered, the original scope 
is retained. Clearly this option is limited to areas in which the customer has the exper￾tise and capability to pick up the tasks.
Outsource Project Activities or Even the Entire Project
When estimates exceed budget, it makes sense to not only re-examine the scope but 
also search for cheaper ways to complete the project. Perhaps instead of relying on 
internal resources, it would be more cost-effective to outsource segments or even the 
entire project, opening up work to external price competition. Specialized subcontrac￾tors often enjoy unique advantages, such as material discounts for large quantities, as 
well as equipment that gets the work done not only more quickly but also less expen￾sively. They may have lower overhead and labor costs. For example, to reduce costs 
of software projects, many American firms outsource work to firms overseas where 
the salary of a software engineer is one-third that of an American software engineer. 
However, outsourcing means you have less control over the project and will need to 
have clearly definable deliverables.
Brainstorm Cost Savings Options
Just as project team members can be a rich source of ideas for accelerating project activi￾ties, they can offer tangible ways for reducing project costs. For example, one project 
manager reported that his/her team was able to come up with over $75,000 worth of 
cost-saving suggestions without jeopardizing the scope of the project. Project managers 
should not underestimate the value of simply asking if there is a cheaper, better way.

lar60886_ch09_326-362.indd 346 09/06/23 09:11 am
Summary The need for reducing the project duration occurs for many reasons such as imposed 
deadlines, time-to-market considerations, incentive contracts, key  resource 
needs, high overhead costs, or simply unforeseen delays. These situations are 
very common in practice and are known as cost-time trade-off decisions. This 
chapter presented a logical, formal process for assessing the implications of situ￾ations that involve shortening the project duration. Crashing the project duration 
increases the risk of being late. How far to reduce the project duration from the 
normal time toward the optimum depends on the sensitivity of the project net￾work. A  sensitive network is one that has several critical or near-critical paths. 
Great care should be taken when shortening sensitive networks to avoid increasing 
project risks. Conversely, insensitive networks represent opportunities for poten￾tially large  project cost savings by eliminating some overhead costs with little 
downside risk.
Alternative strategies for reducing project time were discussed within the con￾text of whether or not the project is resource limited. Project acceleration typically 
comes at a cost of either spending money for more resources or compromising 
the scope of the project. If the latter is the case, then it is essential that all rel￾evant stakeholders be consulted so that everyone accepts the changes that have 
to be made. One other key point is the difference in implementing time-reducing 
activities in the midst of project execution versus incorporating them into the proj￾ect plan. You typically have far fewer options once the project is under way than 
before it begins. This is especially true if you want to take advantage of the new 
scheduling methodologies such as fast tracking and critical chain. Time spent up 
front considering alternatives and developing contingency plans will lead to time 
savings in the end.

 Case 9.1
International Capital, Inc.—Part B
Given the project network derived in Part A of the case from Chapter 7, Appendix 7.1, 
Beth also wants to be prepared to answer any questions concerning compressing the 
project duration. This question will almost always be entertained by the Accounting 
Department, the review committee, and the client. To be ready for the compression 
question, Beth has prepared the following data in case it is necessary to crash the 
project. (Use your weighted average times [t

 Case 9.2
Ventura Baseball Stadium—Part B
This case is based on a case introduced at the end of Chapter 6. You will need to 
use the project plan created in the Ventura Baseball Stadium case to complete this 
assignment.
Ventura Baseball Stadium is a 47,000-seat professional baseball stadium. G&E 
Company began construction on June 10, 2019, and will complete it on February 23, 
2022. The stadium must be ready for the opening of the 2022 regular season. G&E 
would accrue a $500,000-per-day penalty for not meeting the April 3, 2022, deadline.
The project started on time and was progressing well until an accident occurred 
during the pouring of the lower bowl. Two workers were seriously injured, and the 
activity was delayed four weeks while the cause of the accident was investigated and 
the site cleared to proceed.
Using the data provided, determine the activity crashing decisions and best time￾cost project duration. Given the information you have developed, what suggestions 
would you give Beth to ensure she is well prepared for the project review committee? 
Assume the overhead costs for this project are $700 per workday. Will this alter your 
suggestions?

The president of G&E Company, Percival Young, is concerned about the delay of 
the project. The project began with roughly six weeks of cushion between expected 
completion deadline and imposed deadline of April 3 (opening day). Now there is only 
a two-week cushion with over a year’s worth of work still to be completed. He has 
asked you to consider the following options to reduce the duration of the project and 
restore some of the time buffer that has been lost.
A. Assign overtime to complete the installation of seats in 120 days, not 140 days.
B. Assign overtime to complete the infrastructure in 100 days, not 120 days.
C. Introduce a start-to-start lag whereby construction of the roof begins 70 days after 
the start of building roof supports.
D. Introduce a start-to-start lag whereby installing the scoreboard can start 100 days 
after the start of construction of the upper steel bowl.
E. Introduce a start-to-start lag whereby installing seats can start 100 days after the 
start of both pouring the main concourse and constructing the upper steel bowl.
Write a short memo to Young, detailing your recommendation and rationale.
 Case 9.3
Whitbread World Sailboat Race
Each year countries enter their sailing vessels in the nine-month Round the World 
Whitbread Sailboat Race. In recent years about 14 countries entered sailboats in the 
race. Each year’s sailboat entries represent the latest technologies and human skills 
each country can muster.
Bjorn Ericksen has been selected as a project manager because of his past experi￾ence as a master helmsman and because of his recent fame as the “best designer of 
racing sailboats in the world.” Bjorn is pleased and proud to have the opportunity to 
design, build, test, and train the crew for next year’s Whitbread entry for his country. 
Bjorn has picked Karin Knutsen (as chief design engineer) and Trygve Wallvik (as 
master helmsman) to be team leaders responsible for getting next year’s entry ready for 
the traditional parade of all entries on the Thames River in the United Kingdom, which 
signals the start of the race.
As Bjorn begins to think of a project plan, he sees two parallel paths running through 
the project—design and construction and crew training. Last year’s boat will be used 
for training until the new entry can have the crew on board to learn maintenance tasks. 
Bjorn calls Karin and Trygve together to develop a project plan. All three agree the 
major goal is to have a winning boat and crew ready to compete in next year’s competi￾tion at a cost of $3.2 million. A check of Bjorn’s calendar indicates he has 45 weeks 
before next year’s vessel must leave port for the United Kingdom to start the race.
THE KICKOFF MEETING
Bjorn asks Karin to begin by describing the major activities and the sequence required 
to design, construct, and test the boat. Karin starts by noting that design of the hull, 
deck, mast, and accessories should only take 6 weeks—given the design prints from 
past race entries and a few prints from other countries’ entries. After the design is

complete, the hull can be constructed, mast ordered, sails ordered, and accesso￾ries ordered. The hull will require 12 weeks to complete. The mast can be ordered 
and will require a lead time of 8 weeks; the seven sails can be ordered and will take 6 
weeks to get; accessories can be ordered and will take 15 weeks to receive. As soon 
as the hull is finished, the ballast tanks can be installed, requiring 2 weeks. Then the 
deck can be built, which will require 5 weeks. Concurrently the hull can be treated 
with special sealant and friction-resistance coating, taking 3 weeks. When the deck 
is completed and mast and accessories received, the mast and sails can be installed, 
requiring 2 weeks; the accessories can be installed, which will take 6 weeks. When all 
of these activities have been completed, the ship can be sea-tested, which should take 
5 weeks. Karin believes she can have firm cost estimates for the boat in about 2 weeks.
Trygve believes he can start selecting the 12-man or woman crew and securing 
their housing immediately. He believes it will take 6 weeks to get a committed crew 
on-site and 3 weeks to secure housing for the crew members. Trygve reminds Bjorn 
that last year’s vessel must be ready to use for training the moment the crew is on-site 
until the new vessel is ready for testing. Keeping the old vessel operating will cost 
$4,000 per week as long as it is used. Once the crew is on-site and housed, they can 
develop and implement a routine sailing and maintenance training program, which 
will take 15 weeks (using the old vessel). Also, once the crew is selected and on-site, 
crew equipment can be selected, taking only 2 weeks. Then crew equipment can be 
ordered; it will take 5 weeks to arrive. When the crew equipment and maintenance 
training program are complete, crew maintenance on the new vessel can begin; this 
should take 10 weeks. But crew maintenance on the new vessel cannot begin until 
the deck is complete and the mast, sails, and accessories have arrived. Once crew 
maintenance on the new vessel begins, the new vessel will cost $6,000 per week 
until sea training is complete. After the new ship maintenance is complete and while 
the boat is being tested, initial sailing training can be implemented; training should 
take 7 weeks. Finally, after the boat is tested and initial training is complete, regular 
sea training can be implemented—weather permitting; regular sea training requires 
8 weeks. Trygve believes he can put the cost estimates together in a week, given last 
year’s expenses.
Bjorn is pleased with the expertise displayed by his team leaders. But he believes 
they need to have someone develop one of those critical path networks to see if they 
can safely meet the start deadline for the race. Karin and Trygve agree. Karin suggests

the cost estimates should also include crash costs for any activities that can be com￾pressed and the resultant costs for crashing. Karin also suggests the team complete 
the priority matrix shown in Figure C9.1 for project decision making.

Rassy and her project team were developing a project plan aimed at producing 
30 working models in time for MedCON, the biggest medical equipment trade show 
each year. Meeting the MedCON October 25 deadline was critical to success. All the 
major medical equipment manufacturers demonstrated and took orders for new prod￾ucts at MedCON. Rassy had also heard rumors that competitors were considering 
developing a similar product, and she knew that being first to market would have a 
significant sales advantage. Besides, top management made funding contingent upon 
developing a workable plan for meeting the MedCON deadline.
The project team spent the morning working on the schedule for Nightingale. They 
started with the WBS and developed the information for a network, adding activities 
when needed. Then the team added the time estimates they had collected for each 
activity. Following is the preliminary information for activities with duration time and

Use any project network computer program available to you to develop the schedule 
for activities (see the case appendix following Case 9.5 for further instructions)—
noting late and early times, the critical path, and estimated completion for the project.
Prepare a short memo that addresses the following questions:
1. Will the project as planned meet the October 25 deadline?
2. What activities lie on the critical path?
3. How sensitive is this network?
 Case 9.5
Nightingale Project—Part B
Rassy and the team were concerned with the results of your analysis. They spent 
the afternoon brainstorming alternative ways for shortening the project duration. 
They rejected outsourcing activities because most of the work was developmental 
in nature and could only be done in-house. They considered altering the scope 
of the project by eliminating some of the proposed product features. After much 
debate, they felt they could not compromise any of the core features and be suc￾cessful in the marketplace. They then turned their attention to accelerating the 
completion of activities through overtime and adding additional technical man￾power. Rassy had built into her proposal a discretionary fund of $200,000. She 
was willing to invest up to half of this fund to accelerate the project but wanted 
to hold on to at least $100,000 to deal with unexpected problems. After a lengthy 
discussion, her team concluded that the following activities could be reduced at 
the specified cost:
∙ Development of voice recognition system could be reduced from 15 days to 10 days 
at a cost of $15,000.
∙ Creation of database could be reduced from 40 days to 35 days at a cost of 
$35,000.
∙ Document design could be reduced from 35 days to 30 days at a cost of $25,000.
∙ External specifications could be reduced from 18 days to 12 days at a cost of 
$20,000.
∙ Procure prototype components could be reduced from 20 days to 15 days at a cost 
of $30,000.
∙ Order stock parts could be reduced from 15 days to 10 days at a cost of $20,000.
Ken Clark, a development engineer, pointed out that the network contained only 
finish-to-start relationships and that it might be possible to reduce project duration 
by creating start-to-start lags. For example, he said that his people would not have 
to wait for all of the field tests to be completed to begin making final adjustments 
Final PDF to printerChapter 9 Reducing Project Duration 359

in the design. They could start making adjustments after the first 15 days of testing. 
The project team spent the remainder of the day analyzing how they could introduce 
lags into the network to shorten the project. They concluded that the following finish￾to-start relationships could be converted into lags:
∙ Document design could begin 5 days after the start of the review design.
∙ Adjust design could begin 15 days after the start of field test prototypes.
∙ Order stock parts could begin 5 days after the start of adjust design.
∙ Order custom parts could begin 5 days after the start of adjust design.
∙ Training sales representatives could begin 5 days after the start of test unit and com￾pleted 5 days after the production of 30 units.
As the meeting adjourns, Rassy turns to you and tells you to assess the options pre￾sented and try to develop a schedule that will meet the October 25 deadline. You 
are to prepare a report to be presented to the project team that answers the following 
questions:
1. Is it possible to meet the deadline?
2. If so, how would you recommend changing the original schedule (Part A) and why? 
Assess the relative impact of crashing activities versus introducing lags to shorten 
project duration.
3. What would the new schedule look like?
4. What other factors should be considered before finalizing the schedule?
CASE APPENDIX: TECHNICAL DETAILS
Create your project schedule and assess your options based on the following 
information:
1. The project will begin the first working day in January.
2. The following holidays are observed: January 1, Memorial Day (last Monday in 
May), July 4, Labor Day (first Monday in September), Thanksgiving Day (fourth 
Thursday in November), December 25 and 26.
3. If a holiday falls on a Saturday, then Friday will be given as an extra day off; if it 
falls on a Sunday, then Monday will be given as a day off.
4. The project team works Monday through Friday, 8-hour days.
5. If you choose to reduce the duration of any one of the activities mentioned, then 
it must be for the specified time and cost (e.g., you cannot choose to reduce data￾base to 37 days at a reduced cost; you can only reduce it to 35 days at a cost of 
$35,000).
6. You can only spend up to $100,000 to reduce project activities; lags do not contain 
any additional costs.

 Case 9.6
The “Now” Wedding—Part A*
On December 31 of last year, Lauren burst into the family living room and announced 
that she and Connor (her college boyfriend) were going to be married. After recov￾ering from the shock, her mother hugged her and asked, “When?” The following 
conversation resulted:
Lauren: January 21.
Mom: What?
Dad: The Now Wedding will be the social hit of the year. Wait a minute. Why 
so soon?
Lauren: Because on January 30 Connor, who is in the National Guard, will be ship￾ping out overseas. We want a week for a honeymoon.
Mom: But, Honey, we can’t possibly finish all the things that need to be done by 
then. Remember all the details that were involved in your sister’s wedding? 
Even if we start tomorrow, it takes a day to reserve the church and recep￾tion hall, and they need at least 14 days’ notice. That has to be done before 
we can start decorating, which takes 3 days. An extra $200 on Sunday 
would probably cut that 14-day notice to 7 days, though.
Dad: Oh, boy!
Lauren: I want Jane Summers to be my maid of honor.
Dad: But she’s in the Peace Corps in Guatemala, isn’t she? It would take her 
10 days to get ready and drive up here.
Lauren: But we could fly her up in 2 days and it would only cost $1,000.
Dad: Oh, boy!
Mom: And catering! It takes 2 days to choose the cake and decorations, and 
Jack’s Catering wants at least 5 days’ notice. Besides, we’d have to have 
those things before we could start decorating.
Lauren: Can I wear your wedding dress, Mom?
Mom: Well, we’d have to replace some lace, but you could wear it, yes. We could 
order the lace from New York when we order the material for the brides￾maids’ dresses. It takes 8 days to order and receive the material. The pattern 
needs to be chosen first, and that would take 3 days.
Dad: We could get the material here in 5 days if we paid an extra $20 to airfreight 
it. Oh, boy!
Lauren: I want Mrs. Jacks to work on the dresses.
Mom: But she charges $48 a day.
Dad: Oh, boy!
Mom: If we did all the sewing we could finish the dresses in 11 days. If Mrs. Jacks 
helped we could cut that down to 6 days at a cost of $48 for each day less 
than 11 days. She is very good, too.
Lauren: I don’t want anyone but her.

Mom: It would take another 2 days to do the final fitting and 2 more days to clean 
and press the dresses. They would have to be ready by rehearsal night. We 
must have rehearsal the night before the wedding.
Dad: Everything should be ready rehearsal night.
Mom: We’ve forgotten something. The invitations!
Dad: We should order the invitations from Bob’s Printing Shop, and that usually 
takes 7 days. I’ll bet he would do it in 6 days if we slipped him an extra $20!
Mom: It would take us 2 days to choose the invitation style before we could order 
them and we want the envelopes printed with our return address.
Lauren: Oh! That will be elegant.
Mom: The invitations should go out at least 10 days before the wedding. If we let 
them go any later, some of the relatives would get theirs too late to come 
and that would make them mad. I’ll bet that if we didn’t get them out until 
8 days before the wedding, Aunt Ethel couldn’t make it and she would 
reduce her wedding gift by $200.
Dad: Oh, boy!!
Mom: We’ll have to take them to the Post Office to mail them and that takes a 
day. Addressing would take 3 days unless we hired some part-time girls 
and we can’t start until the printer is finished. If we hired the girls we could 
probably save 2 days by spending $40 for each day saved.
Lauren: We need to get gifts for the bridesmaids. I could spend a day and do that.
Mom: Before we can even start to write out those invitations we need a guest list. 
Heavens, that will take 4 days to get in order and only I can understand our 
address file.
Lauren: Oh, Mom, I’m so excited. We can start each of the relatives on a different 
job.
Mom: Honey, I don’t see how we can do it. Why, I’ve got to choose the invitations 
and patterns and reserve the church and . . .
Dad: Why don’t you just take $3,000 and elope? Your sister’s wedding cost me 
$2,400 and she didn’t have to fly people up from Guatemala, hire extra 
girls and Mrs. Jacks, use airfreight, or anything like that.
1. Using the yellow sticky approach shown in Snapshot from Practice 6.1, develop a 
project network for the “Now” wedding.
2. Create a schedule for the wedding using MS Project. Can you reach the deadline 
of January 21 for the “Now” wedding? If you cannot, what would it cost to make 
the January 21 deadline and which activities would you change?
 Case 9.7
The “Now” Wedding—Part B
Several complications arose during the course of trying to meet the deadline of 
January 20 for the “Now” wedding rehearsal. Since Lauren was adamant on having the 
wedding on January 21 (as was Connor for obvious reasons), the implications of each 
of these complications had to be assessed.

I couldn’t wait to be the manager of my own project and run
the project the way I thought it should be done. Boy, did I have a lot 
to learn!
—First-time project manager
This chapter is based on the premise that one of the keys to being an effective project 
manager is building cooperative relationships among different groups of people to 
complete projects. Project success does not just depend on the performance of the 
project team. Success or failure often depends on the contributions of top manage￾ment, functional managers, customers, suppliers, contractors, and others.
The chapter begins with a brief discussion of the differences between manag￾ing and leading a project. The importance of engaging project stakeholders is then 
introduced. Managers require a broad influence base to be effective in this area. 
Different sources of influence are discussed and are used to describe how project 
managers build social capital. This management style necessitates constant inter￾acting with different groups of people whom project managers depend on. Special 
attention is devoted to managing the critical relationship with top management 
and the importance of leading by example. The importance of gaining coopera￾tion in ways that build and sustain the trust of others is emphasized. The chap￾ter concludes by identifying personal attributes associated with being an effective 
project manager. Subsequent chapters will expand on these ideas in a discussion 
of managing the project team and working with people outside the organization. 
It should be noted that the material presented in this chapter is from the point of 
view of a project manager assigned to a traditional, plan-driven project, although 
many of the ideas would apply to those leading agile projects. Applications will be 
addressed in Chapter 15.

10.1 Managing versus Leading a Project
In a perfect world, the project manager would simply implement the project plan and the 
project would be completed. The project manager would work with others to formulate 
a schedule, organize a project team, keep track of progress, and announce what needs 
to be done next, and then everyone would charge along. Of course, no one lives in a 
perfect world, and rarely does everything go according to plan. Project participants get 
testy; they fail to get along with each other; other departments are unable to fulfill their 
commitments; technical glitches arise; work takes longer than expected. The project 
manager’s job is to get the project back on track. A manager expedites certain activities; 
figures out ways to solve technical problems; serves as peacemaker when tensions rise; 
and makes appropriate trade-offs among the time, cost, and scope of the project.
However, project managers often do more than put out fires and keep the project on 
track. They also innovate and adapt to ever-changing circumstances. They sometimes 
have to deviate from what was planned and introduce significant changes in the project 
scope and schedule to respond to unforeseen threats or opportunities. For example, 
customers’ needs may change, requiring significant design changes midway through 
the project. Competitors may release new products that dictate crashing project dead￾lines. Working relationships among project participants may break down, requiring 
a reformulation of the project team. Ultimately, what was planned or expected in the 
beginning may be very different from what was accomplished by the end of the project.
Project managers are responsible for integrating assigned resources to complete the 
project according to plan. At the same time they need to initiate changes in plans 
and schedules as persistent problems make plans unworkable. In other words, man￾agers want to keep the project going while making necessary adjustments along the 
way. According to Kotter (1990) these two different activities represent the distinction 
between management and leadership. Management is about coping with complexity, 
while leadership is about coping with change.
Good management brings about order and stability by formulating plans and objec￾tives, designing structures and procedures, monitoring results against plans, and taking 
corrective action when necessary. Leadership involves recognizing and articulating 
the need to significantly alter the direction and operation of the project, aligning peo￾ple to the new direction, and motivating them to work together to overcome hurdles 
produced by the change and to realize new objectives.
Strong leadership, while usually desirable, is not always necessary to success￾fully complete a project. Well-defined projects that encounter no significant surprises 
require little leadership, as might be the case in constructing a conventional apart￾ment building in which the project manager simply administrates the project plan. 
Conversely, the higher the degree of uncertainty encountered on a project—whether 
in terms of changes in project scope, technological stalemates, or breakdowns in coor￾dination between people—the more leadership is required. For example, strong lead￾ership would be needed for a software development project in which the parameters 
are always changing to meet developments in the industry. Sometime external events 
demand leadership like the COVID-19 pandemic or a tragic accident.
It takes a special person to perform both roles well. Some individuals are great 
visionaries who are good at exciting people about change. Often though, these people 
lack the discipline or patience to deal with the day-to-day drudgeries of managing. 
Likewise, there are individuals who are very well organized and methodical but lack 
the ability to inspire others.

and leading a project.

lar60886_ch10_363-400.indd 366 10/14/23 11:48 am
Strong leaders can compensate for their managerial weaknesses by having trusted 
assistants who oversee and manage the details of the project. Conversely, a weak 
leader can complement his strengths by having assistants who are good at sensing 
the need to change and rallying project participants. Still, one of the things that make 
good project managers so valuable to an organization is that they have the ability to 
both manage and lead a project. In doing so, they recognize the need to create a social 
network that allows them to find out what needs to be done and obtain the cooperation 
necessary to achieve it.
10.2 Engaging Project Stakeholders
First-time project managers are eager to implement their own ideas and manage their 
people to successfully complete their project. What they soon find out is that project 
success depends on the cooperation of a wide range of individuals, many of whom 
do not directly report to them. For example, during the course of a system integration 
project, a project manager was surprised by how much time s/he was spending nego￾tiating and working with vendors, consultants, technical specialists, and other func￾tional managers:
Instead of working with my people to complete the project, I found myself being constantly 
pulled and tugged by demands of different groups of people who were not directly involved 
in the project but had a vested interest in the outcome.
Often when new project managers do find time to work directly on the project, 
they adopt a hands-on approach to managing the project. They choose this style not 
because they are power-hungry egomaniacs but because they are eager to achieve 
results. They become quickly frustrated by how slowly things operate, the number of 
people that have to be brought on board, and the difficulty of gaining cooperation. 
Unfortunately, as this frustration builds, the natural temptation is to exert more pres￾sure and get more heavily involved in the project. These project managers quickly 
earn the reputation of “micro managing” and begin to lose sight of the real role they 
play on guiding a project.
Some new managers never break out of this vicious cycle. Others soon realize that 
authority does not equal influence and that being an effective project manager involves 
managing a much more complex set of stakeholders than they had anticipated. They 
encounter a web of relationships that requires a much broader spectrum of influence 
than they felt was necessary or even possible.
For example, a significant project, whether it involves renovating a bridge, creat￾ing a new product, or installing a new information system, will likely involve, in one 
way or another, working with a number of different groups of stakeholders. First, 
there is the core group of specialists assigned to complete the project. This group 
is likely to be supplemented at different times by professionals who work on spe￾cific segments of the project. Second, there are groups of people within the per￾forming organization who are either directly or indirectly involved with the project. 
The most notable is top management, to whom the project manager is accountable. 
There are also other managers, who provide resources and/or may be responsible for 
specific segments of the project, and administrative support services such as Human 
Resources, Finance, and so on. Depending on the nature of the project, a number of 
groups outside the organization influence the success of the project. They include 
vendors and contractors as well as the most important one—the customer for which 
the project is designed (see Figure 10.1).

Each of these groups of stakeholders brings different expertise, standards, priori￾ties, and agendas to the project. Stakeholders are people and organizations that are 
actively involved in the project or whose interests may be positively or negatively 
affected by the project (Project Management Institute, 2017). The sheer breadth and 
complexity of stakeholder relationships distinguish project management from regular 
management. To be effective, a project manager must understand how stakeholders 
can affect the project and develop methods for managing the dependency. The nature 
of these dependencies is identified here:
∙ The project team manages and completes project work. Most participants want to 
do a good job, but they are also concerned with their other obligations and how their 
involvement on the project will contribute to their personal goals and aspirations.
∙ Project managers naturally compete with each other for resources and the sup￾port of top management. At the same time they often have to share resources and 
exchange information.
∙ Administrative support groups, such as human resources, information systems, pur￾chasing agents, and maintenance, provide valuable support services. At the same 
time they impose constraints and requirements on the project such as the documen￾tation of expenditures and the timely and accurate delivery of information.
∙ Functional managers, depending on how the project is organized, can play a minor 
or major role in project success. In matrix arrangements, they may be responsible 
for assigning project personnel, resolving technical dilemmas, and overseeing the 
completion of significant segments of the project work. Even in dedicated project

teams, the technical input from functional managers may be useful, and acceptance 
of completed project work may be critical to in-house projects. Functional manag￾ers want to cooperate up to a point, but only up to a certain point. They are also 
concerned with preserving their status within the organization and minimizing the 
disruptions the project may have on their own operations.
∙ Top management approves funding of the project and establishes priorities within 
the organization. They define success and adjudicate rewards for accomplish￾ments. Significant adjustments in budget, scope, and schedule typically need their 
approval. They have a natural vested interest in the success of the project but, at the 
same time, have to be responsive to what is best for the entire organization.
∙ Project sponsors champion the project and use their influence to gain approval of 
the project. Their reputation is tied to the success of the project, and they need to be 
kept informed of any major developments. They defend the project when it comes 
under attack and are a key project ally.
∙ Contractors may do all the actual work—in some cases, with the project team 
merely coordinating their contributions. In other cases, they are responsible for 
ancillary segments of the project scope. Poor work and schedule slips can affect the 
work of the core project team. While contractors’ reputations rest with doing good 
work, they must balance their contributions with their own profit margins and their 
commitments to other clients.
∙ Government agencies regulate project work. Permits need to be secured. Construc￾tion work has to be built to code. New drugs have to pass a rigorous battery of U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration tests. Other products have to meet safety standards, 
for example, Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards.
∙ Vendors/suppliers provide the necessary resources for the completion of project 
work. Delays, shortages, and poor quality can bring a project to a standstill.
∙ Other organizations, depending on the nature of the project, may directly or indi￾rectly affect the project. For example, environmental groups may challenge or 
even block project work. Public interest groups may apply pressure on govern￾ment agencies. Customers often hire consultants and auditors to protect their 
interests on a project.
∙ Customers define the scope of the project, and ultimate project success rests in 
their satisfaction. Project managers need to be responsive to changing customer 
needs and requirements and to meeting their expectations. Customers are primarily 
concerned with getting a good deal and, as will be elaborated in Chapter 11, this 
naturally breeds tension with the project manager.
These relationships are interdependent in that a project manager’s ability to work 
effectively with one group will affect his or her ability to engage other groups. For 
example, functional managers are likely to be less cooperative if they perceive that 
top management’s commitment to the project is waning. Conversely, the ability of the 
project manager to buffer the team from excessive interference from a client is likely 
to increase his or her standing with the project team.
The project management structure being used will influence the number and degree 
of external dependencies that need to be engaged. One major advantage of creating a 
dedicated project team is that it reduces dependencies, especially within the organiza￾tion, because most of the resources are assigned to the project. Conversely, a func￾tional matrix structure increases dependencies, with the result that the project manager 
is much more reliant upon functional colleagues for work and staff.

Metaphors convey meaning beyond 
words. For example, a meeting can 
be described as being difficult or “like 
wading through molasses.” A popular 
metaphor for the role of a project man￾ager is that of conductor.
The conductor of an orchestra integrates the diver￾gent sounds of different instruments to perform a given 
composition and make beautiful music. Similarly, the 
project manager integrates the talents and contribu￾tions of different specialists to complete the project. 
Many consider coordinating and integrating the work 
of others as the primary role of project managers 
(Project Management Institute, 2017).
Both a conductor and a project manager have to 
be good at understanding how the different players 
contribute to the performance of the whole. Both are 
almost entirely dependent upon the expertise and 
know-how of the players. The conductor does not have 
command of all the musical instruments. Likewise, the 
project manager usually possesses only a small pro￾portion of the technical knowledge to make decisions. 
As such, the conductor and project manager both 
facilitate the performance of others rather than actu￾ally perform.
Conductors use their arms, baton, and other 
nonverbal gestures to influence the pace, intensity, 
and involvement of different musicians. Likewise, 
project managers orchestrate the completion of the 
project by managing the involvement and attention 
of project members. Project managers balance time 
and process and induce participants to make the 
right decisions at the right time, just as the conductor 
induces the wind instruments to perform at the right 
moment in a movement. Each controls the rhythm 
and intensity of work by managing the tempo and 
involvement of the players.
Finally, each has a vision that transcends the music 
score or project plan. To be successful, they must both 
earn the confidence, respect, and trust of their players.
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 10.1 The Project Manager as Conductor
Jamie Grill/JGI/Blend Images
The old-fashioned view of managing projects emphasized planning and directing 
the project team; the new perspective emphasizes engaging project stakeholders and 
anticipating change as the most important jobs. Project managers need to be able to 
assuage the concerns of customers, sustain support for the project at higher levels of 
the organization, and quickly identify problems that threaten project work. They do 
so while defending the integrity of the project and the interests of the project 
participants.1
Within this web of relationships, the project manager must find out what needs to 
be done to achieve the goals of the project and build a cooperative network to accom￾plish it. Project managers must do so without the requisite authority to expect or 
demand cooperation. Doing so requires sound communication skills, political savvy, 
and a broad influence base. See Snapshot from Practice 10.1: The Project Manager as 
Conductor for more on what makes project managers special.

10.3 Influence as Exchange
To successfully manage a project, a manager must adroitly build a cooperative network 
among divergent allies. Networks are mutually beneficial alliances that are generally gov￾erned by the law of reciprocity (Grant, 2013; Kaplan, 1984). The basic principle is that 
“one good deed deserves another, and likewise one bad deed deserves another.” The pri￾mary way to gain cooperation is to provide resources and services for others in exchange 
for future resources and services. This is the age-old maxim “Quid pro quo (something 
for something)” or, in today’s vernacular, “You scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours.”
Cohen and Bradford (1990) described the exchange view of influence as “currencies.” 
If you want to do business in a given country, you have to be prepared to use the appropriate 
currency, and the exchange rates can change over time as conditions change. In the same 
way, what is valued by a marketing manager may be different from what is valued by a 
veteran project engineer, and you are likely to need to use different influence currency to 
obtain the cooperation of each individual. Although this analogy is a bit of an oversim￾plification, the key premise holds true that in the long run, “debit” and “credit” accounts 
must be balanced for cooperative relationships to work. See Research Highlight 10.1: 
Give and Take for an interesting finding regarding this concept. Table 10.1 presents the 
commonly traded organizational currencies identified by Cohen and Bradford; they are 
then discussed in more detail in the following sections.

Task-Related Currencies
Task-related currencies come in different forms and are based on the project man￾ager’s ability to contribute to others’ accomplishing their work. Probably the most 
significant form of this currency is the ability to respond to subordinates’ requests for 
additional manpower, money, or time to complete a segment of a project. This kind 
of currency is also evident in sharing resources with another project manager who is 
in need. At a more personal level, it may simply mean providing direct assistance to a 
colleague in solving a technical problem.
Providing a good word for a colleague’s proposal or recommendation is another 
form of this currency. Because most work of significance is likely to generate some 
form of opposition, the person who is trying to gain approval for a plan or proposal can 
be greatly aided by having a “friend in court.”
Another form of this currency includes extraordinary effort. For example, fulfilling 
an emergency request to complete a design document in two days instead of the nor￾mal four days is likely to engender gratitude. Finally, sharing valuable information that 
would be useful to other managers is another form of this currency.
Adam Grant from the University 
of Pennsylvania identifies three 
fundamental styles of social inter￾action with regard to the law of 
reciprocity:
Takers—like to get more than give and put their own 
interests ahead of others.
Givers—prefer to give more than they get and pay 
more attention to what others need.
Matchers—strive to preserve an equal balance 
between giving and getting and operate on the prin￾ciple of fairness.
While Grant admits that people will shift from one 
style to another, he cites research that indicates 
that most people develop a primary interaction 
style. He goes on to review research on the rela￾tionship between interaction style and professional 
success. Not surprisingly, he found Givers tend 
to sink to the bottom of the success ladder. They 
make others better off but sacrifice their own suc￾cess in the process.
Guess who is at the very top of the success 
ladder? It is Givers again! Grant goes on to explain 
this paradox by arguing that while it is true that 
many Givers are too caring and too timid, there are 
other Givers who are willing to give more than they 
receive and still keep their own interests in sight, 
using them as a guide for choosing when, how, 
and to whom to give. These kind of Givers are able 
to create much bigger and more powerful social 
networks than Takers and Matchers. The goodwill 
they are able to generate is a major factor behind 
the success of this kind of Givers.
Grant claims that Abraham Lincoln is a perfect 
example of a Giver who climbed to the top. When 
he won the presidency in 1860, he recruited bitter 
competitors whom he had earlier defeated to join 
his management team (Cabinet) in key positions. 
Grant predicts a Taker would have protected his 
ego and invited only “yes men,” and a Matcher
would have offered appointments to allies. Lincoln 
reported he needed the best men possible to run 
the country, and by always focusing on what was 
best for the country he was able to forge an effec￾tive management team.
Effective project managers, like Lincoln, make 
decisions based on what is best for the project/
organization, not personal interests. They go out of 
their way to help others and build social capital. 
They are not timid, but proactive in building con￾nections with key people both within and outside 
their organization. They value dissent and encour￾age healthy discussions.

Success (New York: Viking Press, 2013).

Position-Related Currencies
Position-related currencies stem from the manager’s ability to enhance others’ posi￾tions within their organization. A project manager can do this by giving someone a 
challenging assignment that can aid his or her advancement by developing his or her 
skills and abilities. Being given a chance to prove yourself naturally generates a strong 
sense of gratitude. Sharing the glory and bringing to the attention of higher-ups the 
efforts and accomplishments of others generate goodwill.
Project managers confide that a useful strategy for gaining the cooperation of pro￾fessionals in other departments/organizations is figuring out how to make these people 
look good to their bosses. For example, a project manager worked with a subcontractor 
whose organization was heavily committed to total quality management (TQM). The 
project manager made it a point in top-level briefing meetings to point out how qual￾ity improvement processes initiated by the contractor contributed to cost control and 
problem prevention.
Another variation of recognition is enhancing the reputation of others within the 
firm. “Good press” can pave the way for lots of opportunities, while “bad press” can 
quickly shut a person off and make it difficult to perform. This currency is also evident 
in helping to preserve someone’s reputation by coming to the defense of someone 
unjustly blamed for project setbacks.
Finally, one of the strongest forms of this currency is sharing contacts with other 
people. Helping individuals expand their own networks by introducing them to key 
people naturally engenders gratitude. For example, suggesting to functional managers 
that they should contact a particular person or party if they want to get a request expe￾dited is likely to engender a sense of indebtedness.
Inspiration-Related Currencies
Inspiration-related currencies are perhaps the most powerful form of influence. 
Most sources of inspiration derive from people’s burning desire to make a difference 
and add meaning to their lives. Creating an exciting, bold vision for a project can elicit 
extraordinary commitment. For example, many of the technological breakthroughs 
associated with the introduction of the original Macintosh computer were attributed to 
the feeling that the project members had a chance to change the way people approached 
computers. A variant form of vision is providing an opportunity to do something really 
well. Being able to take pride in your work often drives many people.
Often the very nature of the project provides a source of inspiration. Discovering a 
cure for a devastating disease, introducing a new social program that will help those 
in need, or simply building a bridge that will reduce a major traffic bottleneck can 
provide opportunities for people to feel good about what they are doing and to feel 
that they are making a difference. Inspiration operates as a magnet—pulling people as 
opposed to pushing people toward doing something.
Relationship-Related Currencies
Relationship-related currencies have more to do with strengthening the relationship 
with someone than directly accomplishing the project tasks. The essence of this form 
of influence is forming a relationship that transcends normal professional boundaries 
and extends into the realm of friendship. Such relationships develop by giving per￾sonal and emotional backing. Picking people up when they are feeling down, boost￾ing their confidence, and providing encouragement naturally breed goodwill. Sharing 
a sense of humor and making difficult times fun is another form of this currency. 
Final PDF to printerChapter 10 Being an Effective Project Manager 373
lar60886_ch10_363-400.indd 373 10/14/23 11:48 am
Similarly, engaging in non–work-related activities such as sports and family outings is 
another way relationships are naturally enhanced.
Perhaps the most basic form of this currency is simply listening to other people. 
Psychologists suggest that most people have a strong desire to be understood and that 
relationships break down because the parties stop listening to each other. Sharing per￾sonal secrets/ambitions and being a wise confidant also creates a special bond between 
individuals.
Personal-Related Currencies
Personal-related currencies deal with individual needs and an overriding sense of 
self-esteem. Some argue that self-esteem is a primary psychological need; the extent 
to which you can help others feel a sense of importance and personal worth will natu￾rally generate goodwill. A project manager can enhance a colleague’s sense of worth 
by asking for help and seeking opinions, delegating authority over work, and allowing 
individuals to feel comfortable stretching their abilities. This form of currency can 
also be seen in sincere expressions of gratitude for the contributions of others. Care, 
though, must be exercised in expressing gratitude, since it is easily devalued when 
overused. That is, the first thank you is likely to be more valued than the fiftieth.
The bottom line is that project managers will be influential only insofar as they 
can offer something that others value. Furthermore, given the diverse cast of people 
project managers depend on, it is important that they be able to acquire and exercise 
different influence currencies. The ability to do so will be constrained in part by the 
nature of the project and how it is organized. For example, a project manager who is 
in charge of a dedicated team has considerably more to offer team members than a 
manager who is given the responsibility of coordinating the activities of different pro￾fessionals across different departments and organizations. In such cases, that manager 
will probably have to rely more heavily on personal and relational bases of influence 
to gain the cooperation of others.
10.4 Social Network Building
Mapping Stakeholder Dependencies
The first step to social network building is identifying those stakeholders on whom 
the project depends for success. The project managers and their key assistants need to 
ask the following questions:
∙ Whose cooperation will we need?
∙ Whose agreement or approval will we need?
∙ Whose opposition would keep us from accomplishing the project?
Many project managers find it helpful to draw a map of these dependencies. For exam￾ple, Figure 10.2 contains the dependencies identified by a project manager responsible 
for installing a new financial software system in his or her company.
It is always better to overestimate rather than underestimate dependencies. All too 
often, otherwise talented and successful project managers have been derailed because 
they were blindsided by someone whose position or power they had not anticipated. 
After identifying the stakeholders associated with your project, it is important to assess 
their significance. Here the power/interest matrix introduced in Chapter 3 becomes 
useful. Those individuals with the most power over and interest in the project are 
the most significant stakeholders and deserve the greatest attention. In particular, you

map and develop strate￾gies for managing proj￾ect dependencies.

need to “step into their shoes” and see the project from their perspective by asking the 
following questions:
∙ What differences exist between myself and the people on whom I depend (goals, 
values, pressures, working styles, risks)?
∙ How do these different people view the project (supporters, indifferents, 
antagonists)?
∙ What is the current status of the relationship I have with the people I depend on?
∙ What sources of influence do I have relative to those on whom I depend?
Once you start this analysis, you can begin to appreciate what others value and what 
currencies you might have to offer as a basis on which to build a working relationship. 
You begin to realize where potential problems lie—relationships in which you have 
a current debit or no convertible currency. Furthermore, diagnosing others’ points of 
view as well as the basis for their positions will help you anticipate their reactions and 
feelings about your decisions and actions. This information is vital for selecting the 
appropriate influence strategy and tactics and producing win/win solutions.
For example, after mapping her dependency network, the project manager who was 
in charge of installing the software system realized that she was likely to have serious 
problems with the manager of the Receipts Department, who would be one of the 
primary users of the software. She had no previous history of working with this indi￾vidual but had heard through the grapevine that the manager was upset with the choice 
of software and that he considered this project to be another unnecessary disruption of 
his department’s operation.
Prior to project initiation the project manager arranged to have lunch with the man￾ager, where she sat patiently and listened to his concerns. She later invested additional 
time and attention to educate him and his staff about the benefits of the new software.

She tried to minimize the disruptions the transition would cause in his department. 
She altered the implementation schedule to accommodate his preferences as to when 
the software would be installed and the subsequent training would occur. In turn, the 
receipts manager and his people were much more accepting of the change, and the 
transition to the new software went more smoothly than anticipated.
Management by Wandering Around (MBWA)
The preceding example illustrates a key point—project management is a “contact 
sport.” Once you have established who the key players are, then you initiate con￾tact and begin to build a relationship with those players. Building this relationship 
requires an interactive management style employees at Hewlett Packard referred to 
as management by wandering around (MBWA) to reflect that managers spend the 
majority of their time outside their offices. MBWA is somewhat of a misnomer in that 
there is a purpose/pattern behind the “wandering.” Through face-to-face interactions, 
project managers are able to stay in touch with what is really going on in the project 
and build cooperation essential to project success.
Effective project managers initiate contact with key players to keep abreast of 
developments, anticipate potential problems, provide encouragement, and rein￾force the objectives and vision of the project. They are able to intervene to resolve 
conflicts and prevent stalemates from occurring. In essence, they “manage” the 
project. By staying in touch with various aspects of the project, they become the 
focal point for information. Participants turn to them to obtain the most current and 
comprehensive information about the project, which reinforces their central role as 
project manager.
We have also observed less effective project managers who eschew MBWA and 
attempt to manage projects from their offices and computer terminals. Such manag￾ers proudly announce an open-door policy and encourage others to see them when 
a problem or an issue comes up. To them, no news is good news. This allows their 
contacts to be determined by the relative aggressiveness of others. Those who take 
the initiative and seek out the project manager get too high a proportion of the project 
manager’s attention. Those people less readily available (physically removed) or more 
passive get ignored. This behavior contributes to the adage “Only the squeaky wheel 
gets greased,” which breeds resentment within the project team.
Effective project managers also find the time to interact regularly with more 
distal stakeholders. They keep in touch with suppliers, vendors, top management, 
and other functional managers. In doing so, they maintain familiarity with different 
parties, sustain friendships, discover opportunities to do favors, and understand the 
motives and needs of others. They remind people of commitments and champion 
the cause of their project. They also shape people’s expectations (see Snapshot 
from Practice 10.2: Managing Expectations). Through frequent communication 
they alleviate people’s concerns about the project, dispel rumors, warn people of 
potential problems, and lay the groundwork for dealing with setbacks in a more 
effective manner.
Project managers have adapted the principles of MBWA to the new post pandemic, 
virtual business world. While in-person interactions are preferred, teleconferencing 
has evolved into a worthy substitute. “Face-to-face” communications increase the rich￾ness of the interaction and identification with the other individuals. Video conferenc￾ing provides an efficient means for staying in touch with people regardless of where 
they are located. However, there may be a hidden cost to relying too much on video 
conferencing (see Snapshot from Practice: Fighting Zoom Fatigue).

Unless project managers take the initiative to build a supportive network up front, 
they are likely to see a manager (or other stakeholder) only when there is bad news 
or when they need a favor (e.g., they don’t have the data they promised or the project 
has slipped behind schedule). Without prior, frequent, easy give-and-take interactions 
around nondecisive issues, the encounter prompted by the problem is likely to provoke 
excess tension. The parties are more likely to act defensively, interrupt each other, and 
lose sight of the common goal.
Experienced project managers recognize the need to build relationships before 
they need them. They initiate contact with the key stakeholders at times when there 
are no outstanding issues or problems and therefore no anxieties and suspicions. On 
these social occasions, they naturally engage in small talk and responsive banter. They 
respond to others’ requests for aid, provide supportive counsel, and exchange informa￾tion. In doing so, they establish good feelings which will allow them to deal with more 
serious problems down the road. When one person views another as pleasant, credible, 
and helpful based on past contact, s/he is much more likely to be responsive to requests 
for help and less confrontational when problems arise.2

 This discussion is based on Sayles, L. R., Leadership: Managing in Real Organizations (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1989), 
pp. 70–78.
Dorothy Kirk, a project management 
consultant and program manager 
with Financial Solutions Group of 
Mynd, offers several keen insights 
into the art of managing stakeholder 
expectations:
. . . expectations are hardy. All they need to take root 
is the absence of evidence to the contrary. Once 
rooted, the unspoken word encourages growth. They 
can develop and thrive without being grounded in 
reality. For this reason, project managers do daily 
battle with unrealistic expectations.
She goes on to offer several tips for managing 
expectations:
• The way you present information can either clarify 
or muddy expectations. For example, if you esti￾mate that a task will take 317 hours, you are setting 
high expectations by your precision. The stake￾holder is likely to be unhappy if it takes 323 hours. 
The stakeholder will not be unhappy with 323 
hours if you quoted an estimate of 300–325 hours.
• Recognize that it is only human nature to interpret 
a situation in one’s best interest. For example, if 
you tell someone it will be done by January, you 
are inclined to interpret it to your advantage and 
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 10.2 Managing Expectations*
assume you have to the end of January, while the 
other person believes it will be done January 1st.
• Seize every opportunity to realign expectations 
with reality. Too often we avoid opportunities to 
adjust expectations because we hold on to a false 
hope that things will somehow work out.
• Do not ask for stakeholder suggestions for 
improvement if you do not intend to do some￾thing with their input. Asking for their input raises 
expectations.
• State the obvious. What is obvious to you may be 
obscure to others.
• Don’t avoid delivering bad news. Communicate 
openly and in person. Expect some anger and frus￾tration. Do not get defensive in return. Be prepared 
to explain the impact of the problems. For example, 
never say the project is going to be late without 
being able to give a new date. Explain what you are 
doing to see that this does not continue to happen.
All stakeholders have expectations about the sched￾ule, cost, and project benefits. Project managers 
need to listen for, understand, and manage these 
expectations.

The COVID-19 pandemic created a 
transition from offices to homes where 
there were fewer people to come in 
close contact with. Zoom, Microsoft 
Teams, Google Hangouts, and other 
conferencing systems emerged as the dominate meth￾ods of communication. These programs did an extraor￾dinary job of linking people together visually. But, soon 
people all over the planet were experiencing “zoom 
fatigue.” Zoom fatigue describes the tiredness, weari￾ness, worry, and burnout that accompanies overuse of 
these virtual communications platforms.
Why do video conversations become so tiring? Sci￾entists have found that video conferencing affects dif￾ferent kinds of brain processes. Among other things, it 
(1) mutes echo neurons (that help humans to understand 
and empathize with others) and (2) confounds our Global 
Positioning System (GPS) neurons (which encode our 
location). Confounded GPS neurons cause exhaustion 
and confusion by positioning the Zoomer simultane￾ously in one physical place and another—perhaps very 
distant—virtual place. Related effects include:
1. Cerebral overload. The thinking overload refers 
to the extent of cognition we have to put into a 
task, in terms of intensity and duration. A dialogue 
or discussion is usually easy for humans, but with 
Zoom in the middle, it entails more focused inten￾sity. This is because we normally rely on hand ges￾tures and body language. But when we can only 
see one another’s heads, we tend to make our 
facial expressions more pronounced to make sure 
the recipient get the message. We must also focus 
harder to understand the body language of those 
participating in the Zoom meeting.
2. Excessive eye contact. The number of people 
looking at you and the size of the faces on the 
screen are abnormal in a video conference call. 
So much eye contact with your fellow attendees 
would not occur in a face-to-face meeting. In 
an ordinary face-to-face meeting, participants 
gaze at the speaker, around the room, and at 
their electronic devices. By contrast, everyone is 
always observing each other in Zoom meetings. 
Further, the large size of their faces on-screen 
creates the false feeling of being near to them. 
Because our minds interpret physical closeness 
as being in stressful circumstances, we feel 
increased fatigue.
3. All-day mirror. Visualize staring at yourself with 
a mirror in front of you for eight hours a day. It’s 
bizarre, yes; however, that is exactly what self-view 
within most conferencing systems do. This may not 
bother some people, but for others, who may be 
insecure, this can be nerve-racking.
HOW TO COMBAT ZOOM FATIGUE?
Shorten and, when possible, curtail Zoom meet￾ings. Virtual meetings conducted using conferencing 
systems require a meeting facilitator who keeps the 
participants on task with a targeted termination time. A 
prepared agenda distributed in advance of the meeting 
is critical. Let everyone know that the meeting will not 
last beyond a specified time.
Prevent multi-tasking. It is tempting to take 
advantage of being visible only from the head up and 
to engage in multi-tasking during Zoom meetings. This 
might entail use of your smartphone, tablet, or notebook 
computer. These distractions interfere with your tracking 
the meeting and lead to further stress and fatigue.
Shrink the screen stimuli. Some experts sug￾gest conducting Zoom meetings with a backdrop 
that is plain and uninteresting; otherwise, attendees 
will focus on trying to read your background, that is, 
straining to read the titles of books on bookshelves 
behind you in your background. Such attention to 
things other than the issue being addressed by the 
Zoom meeting are distracting and contribute to 
stress and fatigue.
Disable self-view. Researchers have discovered 
that many video conference participants spend most of 
the time gazing at their own faces. Knowing that your 
video is transmitted to others increases your cogni￾zance of being seen. Such self-awareness can induce 
apprehension and make it difficult to concentrate on 
the issue at hand.
Integrate “eye” breaks. An optometrist sug￾gested something called the 20-20-20 rule. For every 
20 minutes spent looking at a display monitor, take 20 
seconds to look at a building or other object across the 
street that is 20 or more feet away. This practice can 
help rest the eye muscles.

Managing Upward Relations
Research consistently points out that project success is strongly affected by the degree 
to which a project has the support of top management.3
 Such support is reflected in an 
appropriate budget, responsiveness to unexpected needs, and a clear signal to others in 
the organization of the importance of the project and the need to cooperate.
Visible top management support is not only critical for securing the support of 
other managers within an organization but also key in the project manager’s ability to 
motivate the project team. Nothing establishes a manager’s right to lead more than his 
or her ability to defend. To win the loyalty of team members, project managers have 
to be effective advocates for their projects. They have to be able to get top manage￾ment to rescind unreasonable demands, provide additional resources, and recognize 
the accomplishments of team members. This is more easily said than done.
Working relationships with upper management are a common source of conster￾nation. Laments like the following are often made by project managers about upper 
management:
They don’t know how much it sets us back losing Neil to another project.
I would like to see them get this project done with the budget they gave us.
I just wish they would make up their minds as to what is really important.
While it may seem counterintuitive for a subordinate to “manage” a superior, smart 
project managers devote considerable time and attention to influencing and garnering 
the support of top management. Project managers have to accept profound differences 
in perspective and become skilled at the art of persuading superiors.
Many of the tensions that arise between upper management and project managers 
are a result of differences in perspective. Project managers become naturally absorbed 
with what is best for their project. To them the most important thing in the world is 
their project. Top management should have a different set of priorities. They are con￾cerned with what is best for the entire organization. “Your project” is just one of many 
concerns they are dealing with. It is only natural for these two interests to conflict at 
times. For example, a project manager may lobby intensively for additional personnel, 
only to be turned down because top management believes that the other departments 
cannot afford a reduction in staff. Although frequent communication can minimize 
differences, the project manager has to accept the fact that top management is inevita￾bly going to see the world differently.
Once project managers accept that disagreements with superiors are more a ques￾tion of perspective than substance, they can focus more of their energy on the art of 
persuading upper management. But before they can persuade superiors, they should 
first prove loyalty (Sayles, 1989). Loyalty in this context simply means that most of 
the time project managers consistently follow through on requests and adhere to the 
parameters established by top management without a great deal of grumbling or fuss. 
Once managers have proven loyalty to upper management, senior management is 
much more receptive to their challenges and requests.
Project managers have to cultivate strong ties with upper managers who are spon￾soring the project. As noted earlier, these are high-ranking officials who have cham￾pioned approval and funding of the project; as such, their reputations are aligned with 
the project. Sponsors are also the ones who defend the project when it is under attack 
in upper circles of management. They shelter the project from excessive interference 
(see Figure 10.3). Project managers should always keep such people informed of any

problems that may cause embarrassment or disappointment. For example, if costs are 
beginning to outrun the budget or a technical glitch is threatening to delay the comple￾tion of the project, managers make sure that the sponsors are the first to know.
Timing is everything. Asking for additional budget the day after disappointing third￾quarter earnings are reported is going to be much more difficult than making a similar 
request four weeks later. Good project managers pick the optimum time to appeal to 
top management. They enlist their project sponsors to lobby their cause. They also 
realize there are limits to top management’s accommodations. Here, the Lone Ranger 
analogy is appropriate—you have only so many silver bullets, so use them wisely.
Project managers need to adapt their communication pattern to that of the senior 
group. For example, one project manager recognized that top management had a ten￾dency to use sports metaphors to describe business situations, so s/he framed a recent 
slip in schedule by admitting that “we lost five yards, but we still have two plays to 
make a first down.” Smart project managers learn the language of top management 
and use it to their advantage.
Finally, a few project managers admit ignoring chains of command. If they are con￾fident that top management will reject an important request and that what they want to 
do will benefit the project, they do it without asking permission. While acknowledging 
that this is very risky, they claim that bosses typically won’t argue with success.
Leading by Example
A highly visible, interactive management style not only is essential to building and 
sustaining cooperative relationships but also allows project managers to utilize their 
most powerful leadership tool—their own behavior (Kouzes & Posner, 2012; Peters, 
1988). Often, when faced with uncertainty, people look to others for cues as to how to 
respond and demonstrate a propensity to mimic the behavior of people they respect. A 
project manager’s behavior symbolizes how other people should work on the project. 
Through their behavior, project managers can influence how others act and respond to 
a variety of issues related to the project. (See Snapshot from Practice 10.3: Leading at 
the Edge for a dramatic example of this.)
To be effective, project managers must “walk the talk” (see Figure 10.4). Six aspects 
of leading by example are discussed next.

In 1914, the intrepid explorer Ernest 
Shackleton embarked on the Endur￾ance with his team of seamen and 
scientists, intent upon crossing the 
unexplored Antarctic continent. What 
happened in the two years between their departure 
and their ultimate, incredible rescue has rarely been 
matched in the annals of survival: a ship crushed by 
expanding ice pack; a crew stranded on the floes of the 
frozen Weddell Sea; two perilous treks in open boats 
across a raging Southern Ocean; and a team marooned 
on wild, forlorn Elephant Island, stretched to the limits 
of human endurance.
This adventure provided the basis for the book 
Leading at the Edge: Leadership Lessons from the 
Extraordinary Saga of Shackleton’s Antarctic Expe￾dition, written by Dennis Perkins. Perkins provides 
numerous incidents of how Shackleton’s personal 
example influenced the behavior of his beleaguered 
crew. For example, from the beginning of the Trans￾Atlantic expedition to its end, Shackleton consis￾tently encouraged behavior that emphasized caring 
and respect:
After the destruction of the Endurance Shackleton 
heated hot milk for the crew and went from tent to 
tent with the “life giving” drink. After the sail to the 
island of South Georgia, when the exhausted crew 
had landed, Shackleton took the first watch, which he 
kept for three hours instead of the usual one.
Crew members emulated the caring behaviors 
that Shackleton modeled. A good example of this 
occurred during one of the most dramatic moments 
in the Endurance saga. The food supply had dwin￾dled to perilously low levels. Less than a week’s sup￾ply remained, and the tiny ration of seal steak usually 
served at breakfast was eliminated. The waste meat 
generally used to feed the dogs was inspected for 
edible scraps.
Under these wretched conditions, and after a 
wet, sleepless night, an argument broke out among 
some of the team members. Caught in the middle, 
one crew member (Greenstreet) spilled his tiny ration 
of powdered milk and shouted at the biologist (Clark). 
Alfred Lansing described what happened next:
Greenstreet paused to get his breath, and in that 
instant his anger was spent and he suddenly fell 
silent. Everyone else in the tent became quiet, too, 
and looked at Greenstreet, shaggy-haired, bearded, 
and filthy with blubber soot, holding his empty mug in 
his hand and looking helplessly down into the snow 
that had thirstily soaked up his precious milk. The loss 
was so tragic he seemed almost on the point of weep￾ing. Without speaking, Clark reached out and poured 
some milk into Greenstreet’s mug. Then Worsely, then 
Macklin, and Rickerson and Kerr, Orde-Lees, and 
finally Blackborrow. They finished in silence.

Priorities
Actions speak louder than words. Subordinates and others discern project managers’ 
priorities by how they spend their time. If a project manager claims that this project 
is critical and then is perceived as devoting more time to other projects, then all her 
Final PDF to printerChapter 10 Being an Effective Project Manager 381
lar60886_ch10_363-400.indd 381 10/14/23 11:48 am
verbal reassurances are likely to fall on deaf ears. Conversely a project manager who 
takes the time to observe a critical test instead of simply waiting for a report affirms 
the importance of the testers and their work. Likewise, the types of questions proj￾ect managers pose communicate priorities. By repeatedly asking how specific issues 
relate to satisfying the customer, a project manager can reinforce the importance of 
customer satisfaction.
Urgency
Through their actions, project managers can convey a sense of urgency, which can 
permeate project activities. This urgency in part can be conveyed through stringent 
deadlines, frequent status report meetings, and aggressive solutions for expediting the 
project. The project manager uses these tools like a metronome to pick up the beat of 
the project. At the same time, such devices will be ineffective if there is not also a cor￾responding change in the project manager’s behavior. If project managers want others 
to work faster and solve problems quicker, then they need to work faster. They need to 
hasten the pace of their own behavior. They should accelerate the frequency of their 
interactions, talk and walk more quickly, get to work sooner, and leave work later. By 
simply increasing the pace of their daily interaction patterns, project managers can 
reinforce a sense of urgency in others.
Problem Solving
How project managers respond to problems sets the tone for how others tackle problems. 
If bad news is greeted by verbal attacks, then others will be reluctant to be forthcoming.4
If the project manager is more concerned with finding out who is to blame instead of how 
to prevent problems from happening again, then others will tend to cover their tracks and 
cast the blame elsewhere. If, on the other hand, project managers focus more on how they 
can turn a problem into an opportunity or what can be learned from a mistake, then oth￾ers are more likely to adopt a more proactive approach to problem solving.
Cooperation
How project managers act toward outsiders influences how team members interact 
with outsiders. If a project manager makes disparaging remarks about the “idiots” in 
the Marketing Department, then this oftentimes becomes the shared view of the entire 
team. If project managers set the norm of treating outsiders with respect and being 
responsive to their needs, then others will more likely follow suit.
Standards of Performance
Veteran project managers recognize that if they want participants to exceed project 
expectations, then they have to exceed others’ expectations of a good project manager. 
They establish a high standard for project performance through the quality of their 
daily interactions. They respond quickly to the needs of others, carefully prepare and 
run crisp meetings, stay on top of all the critical issues, facilitate effective problem 
solving, and stand firm on important matters.
Ethics
How others respond to ethical dilemmas that arise in the course of a project will 
be influenced by how the project manager has responded to similar dilemmas.

 This is the classic “kill the messenger” syndrome. This and other forces that contribute to distorting information can be 
found in Larson, E., and J. King, “The Systemic Distortion of Information: An On-going Management Challenge,” Organiza￾tional Dynamics, Winter 1996, pp. 49–62.

In many cases, team members base their actions on how they think the project 
manager would act. If project managers deliberately distort or withhold vital infor￾mation from customers or top management, then they are signaling to others that 
this kind of behavior is acceptable. Project management invariably creates a vari￾ety of ethical dilemmas; this would be an appropriate time to delve into this topic 
in more detail.
10.5 Ethics and Project Management
Questions of ethics have already arisen in previous chapters that discussed padding 
of cost and time estimations, exaggerating pay-offs of project proposals, and so forth. 
Ethical dilemmas involve situations where it is difficult to determine whether conduct 
is right or wrong.
In a survey of project managers, 81 percent reported that they encounter ethical 
issues in their work.5
 These dilemmas include being pressured to alter status reports, 
backdate signatures, compromising safety standards to accelerate progress, and 
approving shoddy work. The work of Müller and colleagues suggests that the most 
common dilemma project managers face involves transparency issues related to proj￾ect performance (Müller et al., 2013, 2014). For example, is it acceptable to falsely 
assure customers that everything is on track when in reality you are doing so to prevent 
them from panicking and making matters even worse?
Project management is complicated work, and, as such, ethics invariably involve 
gray areas of judgment and interpretation. For example, it is difficult to distinguish 
deliberate falsification of estimates from genuine mistakes or the willful exaggera￾tion of project payoffs from genuine optimism. It becomes problematic to determine 
whether unfulfilled promises were deliberate deception or an appropriate response to 
changing circumstances.
To provide greater clarity to business ethics, many companies and professional 
groups publish a code of conduct. Cynics see these documents as simply window 
dressing, while advocates argue that they are important, albeit limited, first steps. In 
practice, personal ethics do not lie in formal statutes but at the intersection of one’s 
work, family, education, profession, religious beliefs, and daily interactions. Most 
project managers report that they rely on their own private sense of right and wrong—
what one project manager called his “internal compass.” One common rule of thumb 
for testing whether a response is ethical is to ask, “Imagine that whatever you did was 
going to be reported on the front page of your local newspaper. How would you like 
that? Would you be comfortable?”
Unfortunately, scandals at Wells Fargo, Enron, WorldCom, and Arthur Andersen 
have demonstrated the willingness of highly trained professionals to abdicate personal 
responsibility for illegal actions and to obey the directives of superiors (see Snapshot 
from Practice 10.4: The Collapse of Arthur Andersen). Top management and the cul￾ture of an organization play a decisive role in shaping members’ beliefs of what is right 
and wrong. Many organizations encourage ethical transgressions by creating a “win at 
all cost” mentality. The pressures to succeed obscure the consideration of whether the

and acting in an ethical 
manner while working 
on a project.

 While this survey is a bit old, our conversations with project managers suggest that the results hold true today: (Cabanis, 
J., “A Question of Ethics: The Issues Project Managers Face and How They Resolve Them,” PM Network, December 1996, 
pp. 8–28).
Final PDF to printerChapter 10 Being an Effective Project Manager 383

ends justify the means. Other organizations place a premium on “fair play” and com￾mand a market position by virtue of being trustworthy and reliable.6
Many project managers claim that ethical behavior is its own reward. By follow￾ing your own internal compass, your behavior expresses your personal values. Others 
suggest that ethical behavior is doubly rewarding. You not only are able to fall asleep 
at night but also develop a sound and admirable reputation. As will be explored in the 
next section, such a reputation is essential to establishing the trust necessary to exer￾cise influence effectively.

 For a more in-depth discussion of ethics, see: Trevino, L., and K. Nelson, Managing Business Ethics: Straight Talk about 
How to Do It Right, 5th ed. (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2011).
“Think straight and talk straight” 
was the principle on which Arthur E. 
Andersen built his accounting firm in 
the early 1900s. It was a phrase his 
mother taught him and became the 
firm’s motto. The commitment to integrity and a sys￾tematic, planned approach to work were instrumental 
in Arthur Andersen becoming one of the largest and 
best-known accounting firms in the world.
According to the book Inside Arthur Anderson by 
Susan Squires and colleagues,
Working for Arthur Andersen was not for everyone. It 
could be a tough culture. It was much too hierarchical 
and top down for the more free spirited. Many people 
left after less than two years, believing the rewards 
did not warrant the demands that were made on 
them. Others learned to play by the rules and some 
even thrived. To remain in the firm, staff members 
were expected to work hard, respect authority of 
rank, and maintain a high level of conformity. In return 
they were rewarded with support, promotion, and 
the possibility of making partner. Those individuals 
who made a career with the firm grew old together, 
professionally and personally, and most had never 
worked anywhere else. To these survivors, Andersen 
was their second family, and they developed strong 
loyalties to the firm and its culture. (p. 133)
On October 23, 2001, David Duncan told his Houston￾based Enron project team that they needed to start 
complying with Andersen’s new policy on handling 
audit documents. The policy had been instituted 
to make sure that the firm’s extraneous paperwork 
could not be used in court cases. Although the docu￾ment retention policy required that papers supporting 
the firm’s opinions and audit be retained, it allowed 
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 10.4 The Collapse of Arthur Andersen*
a broad category of secondary documents to be 
destroyed. The team reacted with stunned silence to 
Duncan’s directive. Then everyone got up and began 
racing to do what they had been told to do. No one 
asked Duncan to explain further. None asked whether 
what they were doing was wrong. No one questioned 
whether what he or she were doing might be illegal. 
Andersen’s Houston staff just reacted, following orders 
without question.
On November 9, 2001, the day after the Securi￾ties Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a subpoena to 
Andersen, the shredding stopped. More than one ton 
of documents had been destroyed and 30,000 e-mails 
and Enron-related computer files erased. According to 
Andersen’s legal defense team, the shredding was busi￾ness as usual. The lawyers claimed that the shredding 
was standard practice for eliminating unnecessary files. 
To the SEC, it appeared to be the start of a deep cover￾up operation. Subsequently one of the most respected 
accounting firms in the world closed its doors.

10.6 Building Trust: The Key to Exercising Influence
The significance of trust can be discerned by its absence. Imagine how different a 
working relationship is when you distrust the other party as opposed to trusting them. 
Here is what one line manager had to say about how she reacted to a project manager 
she did not trust:
Whenever Jim approached me about something, I found myself trying to read between the 
lines to figure what was really going on. When he made a request, my initial reaction was 
“no” until he proved it.
Conversely trust is the “lubricant” that maintains smooth and efficient interactions. 
For example, here is what a functional manager had to say about how he dealt with a 
project manager he trusted:
If Sally said she needed something, no questions were asked. I knew it was important or she 
wouldn’t have asked. Likewise, if I needed something, I knew she would come through for 
me if she could.
Trust is an elusive concept. It is hard to nail down in precise terms why some project 
managers are trusted and others are not. One popular way to understand trust is to see 
it as a function of character and competence. Character focuses on personal motives 
(e.g., does he or she want to do the right thing?), while competence focuses on skills 
necessary to realize motives (e.g., does he or she know the right things to do?).
Stephen Covey resurrected the significance of character in the leadership literature 
in his best-selling Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. Covey criticized popular 
management literature as focusing too much on shallow human relations skills and 
manipulative techniques, which he labeled the personality ethic. He argues that at the 
core of highly effective people is a character ethic that is deeply rooted in personal val￾ues and principles such as dignity, service, fairness, the pursuit of truth, and respect.
One of the distinguishing traits of character is consistency. When people are guided 
by a core set of principles, they are naturally more predictable because their actions 
are consistent with these principles. Another feature of character is openness. When 
people have a clear sense of who they are and what they value, they are more recep￾tive to others. This trait provides them with the capacity to empathize and the talent 
to build consensus among divergent people. Finally, another quality of character is a 
sense of purpose. Managers with character are driven not only by personal ambitions 
but also for the common good. Their primary concern is what is best for their organi￾zation and the project, not what is best for themselves. This willingness to subordinate 
personal interests to a higher purpose garners the respect, loyalty, and trust of others.
The significance of character is summarized by the comments made by two team 
members about two very different project managers:
At first everyone liked Joe and was excited about the project. But after a while, people became 
suspicious of his motives. He had a tendency to say different things to different people. People 
began to feel manipulated. He spent too much time with top management. People began to 
believe that he was only looking out for himself. It was HIS project. When the project began to 
slip he jumped ship and left us holding the bag. I’ll never work for that guy again.
My first impression of Jack was nothing special. He had a quiet, unassuming management 
style. Over time I learned to respect his judgment and his ability to get people to work together. 
When you went to him with a problem or a request, he always listened carefully. If he couldn’t 
do what you wanted him to do, he would take the time to explain why. When disagreements 
arose he always thought of what was best for the project. He treated everyone by the same rules; 
no one got special treatment. I’d jump at the opportunity to work on a project with him again.

lar60886_ch10_363-400.indd 385 10/14/23 11:48 am
Character alone will not engender trust. We must also have confidence in the com￾petency of individuals before we really trust them (Kanter, 1979). We all know well￾intended managers whom we like but do not trust because they have a history of 
coming up short on their promises. Although we may befriend these managers, we 
don’t like to work with or for them.
Competence is reflected at a number of different levels. First, there is task-related 
knowledge and skills reflected in the ability to answer questions, solve technical prob￾lems, and excel in certain kinds of work. Second, there is competence at an inter￾personal level demonstrated in being able to listen effectively, communicate clearly, 
resolve arguments, provide encouragement, and so forth. Finally, there is organiza￾tional competence. This includes being able to run effective meetings, set meaningful 
objectives, reduce inefficiencies, and build a social network. Often young engineers 
and other professionals tend to place too much value on task or technical competence. 
They underestimate the significance of organizational skills. Veteran professionals, on 
the other hand, recognize the importance of management and place a greater value on 
organizational and interpersonal skills.
One problem new project managers experience is that it takes time to establish a 
sense of character and competency. Character and competency are often demonstrated 
when they are tested, such as when a tough call has to be made or when difficult prob￾lems have to be solved. Veteran project managers have the advantage of reputation and 
an established track record of success. Although endorsements from credible sponsors 
can help young project managers create a favorable first impression, ultimately their 
behavior will determine whether they can be trusted. Recent research suggests that the 
first step in building trust is connecting. Instead of starting off emphasizing your compe￾tency, focus on exhibiting warmth and concern.7
 In doing so, you demonstrate to others 
that you hear them, understand them, and can be trusted by them (Cuddy, Kohu, & 
Neffinger, 2013).
So far this chapter has addressed the importance of building a network of rela￾tionships to complete a project based on trust and reciprocity. The next section 
examines the nature of project management work and the personal qualities needed 
to excel at it.
10.7 Qualities of an Effective Project Manager
Project management is, at first glance, a misleading discipline in that there is an inher￾ent logic to the process. There is a natural progression from formulating a project 
scope statement to creating a WBS, developing a network, adding resources, final￾izing a plan, and reaching milestones. However, when it comes to actually implement￾ing and completing projects, this logic can quickly disappear. Project managers often 
encounter a much messier world, filled with inconsistencies and paradoxes. Effective 
project managers have to be able to deal with the contradictory nature of their work. 
Some of those contradictions are listed here:
∙ Innovate and maintain stability. Project managers have to put out fires, restore 
order, and get the project back on track. At the same time they often need to be 
innovative and develop new, better ways of doing things. Innovations upset routines 
and may spark new disturbances that have to be dealt with.

 Warmth is reflected nonverbally in terms of smiling, appropriate eye contact, and gestures as well as verbally in ques￾tions asked and empathetic listening.

lar60886_ch10_363-400.indd 386 10/14/23 11:48 am
∙ See the big picture while getting their hands dirty. Project managers have to see 
the big picture and how their project fits within the larger strategy of their firm. 
There are also times when they must get deeply involved in project work and tech￾nology. If they don’t worry about the details, who will?
∙ Encourage individuals but stress the team. Project managers have to motivate, 
cajole, and entice individual performers while maintaining teamwork. They have 
to be careful that they are considered fair and consistent in their treatment of team 
members while treating each member as a special individual.
∙ Be hands-off/hands-on. Project managers have to intervene, resolve stalemates, 
solve technical problems, and insist on different approaches. At the same time they 
have to recognize when it is appropriate to sit on the sidelines and let other people 
figure out what to do.
∙ Be flexible but firm. Project managers have to be adaptable and responsive to 
events and outcomes that occur on the project. At the same time they have to hold 
the line at times and tough it out when everyone else wants to give up.
∙ Manage team versus organizational loyalties. Project managers need to forge a 
unified project team whose members stimulate one another to extraordinary perfor￾mance. But at the same time they have to counter the excesses of cohesion and the 
team’s resistance to outside ideas. They have to cultivate loyalties to both the team 
and the parent organization.
Managing these and other contradictions requires finesse and balance. Finesse involves 
the skillful movement back and forth between opposing behavioral patterns (Sayles, 
1989). For example, most of the time project managers actively involve others, move 
by increment, and seek consensus. There are other times when project managers must 
act as autocrats and take decisive, unilateral action. Balance involves recognizing the 
danger of extremes and that too much of a good thing invariably becomes harmful. 
For example, many managers have a tendency to always delegate the most stressful, 
difficult assignments to their best team members. This habit often breeds resentment 
among those chosen (“why am I always the one who gets the tough work?”) and never 
allows the weaker members to develop their talents further.
There is no one management style or formula for being an effective project 
manager. The world of project management is too complicated for formulas. Suc￾cessful project managers have a knack for tailoring styles to specific circumstances 
of the situation.
So what should one look for in an effective project manager? Many authors have 
addressed this question and have generated list after list of skills and attributes associated 
with being an effective manager (Posner, 1987; Shenhar & Nofziner, 1997; Turner & 
Müller, 2005). When reviewing these lists, one sometimes gets the impression that to 
be a successful project manager requires someone with superhuman powers. While 
not everyone has the right stuff to be an effective project manager, there are some core 
traits and skills that can be developed to successfully perform the job. The following 
are eight of these traits.
1. Effective communication skills. Communication is critical to project success. 
Project managers need to speak the language of different stakeholders and be empa￾thetic listeners.
2. Systems thinking. Project managers must be able to take a holistic rather than a 
reductionist approach to projects. Instead of breaking up a project into individual 
pieces (planning, budget) and managing it by understanding each part, a systems 
perspective focuses on trying to understand how relevant project factors collectively 
Final PDF to printerlar60886_ch10_363-400.indd 387 10/14/23 11:48 am
387 
interact to produce project outcomes. The key to success then becomes managing 
the interaction between different parts and not the parts themselves.8
3. Personal integrity. Before you can lead and manage others, you have to be able 
to lead and manage yourself (Bennis, 1989). Begin by establishing a firm sense of 
who you are, what you stand for, and how you should behave. This inner strength 
provides the buoyancy to endure the ups and downs of the project life cycle and the 
credibility essential to sustaining the trust of others.
4. Proactivity. Good project managers take action before it is needed to prevent small 
concerns from escalating into major problems. They spend the majority of their 
time working within their sphere of influence to solve problems and not dwelling 
on things they have little control over. Project managers can’t be whiners.9
5. High emotional intelligence (EQ). Project management is not for the meek. Proj￾ect managers have to have command of their emotions and be able to respond con￾structively to others when things get a bit out of control. See Research Highlight 
10.2: Emotional Intelligence to read more about this quality.

Emotional intelligence (EQ) is the 
ability or skill to perceive, assess, 
and manage the emotions of 
oneself and others. Although the 
notion of EQ emerged in the 1920s, 
it was not until Daniel Goleman pub￾lished his book Emotional Intelligence that the con￾cept captured the attention of business people and 
the public alike.
Goleman divided EQ into the following five 
emotional competencies:
• Self-awareness—knowing your emotions, 
recognizing feelings as they occur, and under￾standing the link between your emotions and 
your behavior. Self-awareness is reflected in 
confidence, a realistic assessment of personal 
strengths/weaknesses, and an ability to make 
fun of oneself.
• Self-regulation—being able to control dis￾ruptive impulses and moods and respond 
appropriately to situations. Self-regulation is 
reflected in trustworthiness and openness to 
change.
• Self-motivation—being able to gather up your 
feelings and pursue goals with energy, passion, 
and persistence. The hallmarks of self-motivation 
include a strong desire to achieve and internal 
optimism.
• Empathy—being able to recognize the feelings 
of others and tuning in to their verbal and non￾verbal cues. Empathy is reflected in the ability 
to sustain relationships and in cross-cultural 
sensitivity.
• Social skills—being able to build social networks 
and rapport with different kinds of people. Social 
skills include being able to lead change, resolve 
conflicts, and build effective teams.
Not much imagination is needed to see how EQ 
would contribute to being an effective project 
manager.
In Goleman’s view, these competences build 
on each other in a hierarchy. At the bottom of his 
hierarchy is self-awareness. Some level of self￾awareness is needed to move to self-regulation. 
Ultimately, social skills require all four of the other 
competencies in order to begin to be proficient at 
leading others. Experts believe that most people 
can learn to significantly increase their EQ. Numer￾ous training programs and materials have emerged 
to help individuals realize their EQ potential.

6. General business perspective. Because the primary role of a project manager is 
to integrate the contributions of different business and technical disciplines, it is 
important that a manager have a general grasp of business fundamentals and how 
the different functional disciplines interact to contribute to a successful business.
7. Effective time management. Time is a manager’s scarcest resource. Project man￾agers have to be able to budget their time wisely and quickly adjust their priorities. 
They need to balance their interactions so no one feels ignored.
8. Optimism. Project managers have to display a can-do attitude. They have to be 
able to find rays of sunlight in a dismal day and keep people’s attention positive. 
A good sense of humor and a playful attitude are often a project manager’s great￾est strengths.
So how does one develop these traits? Workshops, self-study, and courses can upgrade 
one’s general business perspective and capacity for systems thinking. Training pro￾grams can improve emotional intelligence and communication skills. People can also 
be taught stress and time management techniques. However, we know of no workshop 
or magic potion that can transform a pessimist into an optimist or provide a sense of 
purpose when there is not one. These qualities get at the very soul or being of a per￾son. Optimism, integrity, and even proactivity are not easily developed if there is not 
already a predisposition to display them.
Summary To be successful, project managers must build a cooperative network among a diverse 
set of allies. They begin by identifying the key stakeholders on a project, then diagnose 
the nature of the relationships and the basis for exercising influence. Effective project 
managers are skilled at acquiring and exercising a wide range of influence. They use 
this influence and a highly interactive management style to monitor project perfor￾mance and initiate appropriate changes in project plans and direction. They do so in a 
manner that generates trust, which is ultimately based on others’ perceptions of their 
character and competence.
Project managers are encouraged to keep in mind the following suggestions.
∙ Relationships should be built before they are needed. Identify key players and what 
you can do to help them before you need their assistance. It is always easier to 
receive a favor after you have granted one. This requires the project manager to see 
the project in systems terms and to appreciate how it affects other activities and 
agendas inside and outside the organization. From this perspective they can identify 
opportunities to do good deeds and garner the support of others.
∙ Trust is sustained through frequent face-to-face contact. Trust withers through 
neglect. This is particularly true under conditions of rapid change and uncertainty 
that naturally engender doubt, suspicion, and even momentary bouts of paranoia. 
Project managers must maintain frequent contact with key stakeholders to keep 
abreast of developments, assuage concerns, engage in reality testing, and focus 
attention on the project. Frequent face-to-face interactions either directly or by tele￾conferencing affirm mutual respect and trust in each other.
Ultimately, exercising influence in an effective and ethical manner begins and ends 
with how you view the other parties. Do you view them as potential partners or obsta￾cles to your goals? If obstacles, then you wield your influence to manipulate and gain 
Final PDF to printerChapter 10 Being an Effective Project Manager 389
lar60886_ch10_363-400.indd 389 10/14/23 11:48 am
compliance and cooperation. If partners, you exercise influence to gain their commit￾ment and support. People who view social network building as building partnerships 
see every interaction with two goals: resolving the immediate problem/concern and 
improving the working relationship so that next time it will be even more effective. 
Experienced project managers realize that “what goes around comes around” and try 
at all cost to avoid antagonizing players for quick success.

1. Do an Internet search for the Keirsey Temperament Sorter Questionnaire and find 
a site that appears to have a reputable self-assessment questionnaire. Respond to 
the questionnaire to identify your temperament type. Read supportive documents 
associated with your type. What does this material suggest are the kinds of proj￾ects that would best suit you? What does it suggest your strengths and weaknesses 
are as a project manager? How can you compensate for your weaknesses?
2. Access the Project Management Institute website and review the standards con￾tained in the PMI Member Ethical Standards section. How useful is the informa￾tion for helping someone decide what behavior is appropriate and inappropriate?
3. You are organizing a benefit concert in your hometown that will feature local 
heavy metal rock groups and guest speakers. Draw a dependency map identifying 
the major groups of people that are likely to affect the success of this project. Who 
do you think will be most cooperative? Who do you think will be least coopera￾tive? Why?
4. You are the project manager responsible for the overall construction of a new 
international airport. Draw a dependency map identifying the major groups of 
people that are likely to affect the success of this project. Who do you think will 
be most cooperative? Who do you think will be least cooperative? Why?
5. Identify an important relationship (co-worker, boss, friend) in which you are hav￾ing trouble gaining cooperation. Assess this relationship in terms of the influence 
currency model. What kinds of influence currency have you been exchanging in 
this relationship? Is the “bank account” for this relationship in the “red” or the 
“black”? What kinds of influence would be appropriate for building a stronger 
relationship with that person?
6. The following seven mini-case scenarios involve ethical dilemmas associated with 
project management. How would you respond to each situation and why?
Jack Nietzche
You returned from a project staffing meeting in which future project assignments were 
finalized. Despite your best efforts, you were unable to persuade the director of project 
management to promote one of your best assistants, Jack Nietzche, to a project manager 
position. You feel a bit guilty because you dangled the prospect of this promotion to 
motivate Jack. Jack responded by putting in extra hours to ensure that his segments of the 
project were completed on time. You wonder how Jack will react to this disappointment. 
More importantly, you wonder how his reaction might affect your project. You have five 
days remaining to meet a critical deadline for a very important customer. While it won’t 
be easy, you believed you would be able to complete the project on time. Now you’re not 
so sure. Jack is halfway through completing the documentation phase, which is the last 
critical activity. Jack can be pretty emotional at times, and you are worried that he will 
blow up once he finds he didn’t get the promotion. As you return to your office, you 
wonder what you should do. Should you tell Jack that he isn’t going to be promoted? 
What should you say if he asks about whether the new assignments were made?
Seaburst Construction Project
You are the project manager for the Seaburst construction project. So far the project is 
progressing ahead of schedule and below budget. You attribute this in part to the good 
working relationship you have with the carpenters, plumbers, electricians, and machine 
operators who work for your organization. More than once you have asked them to 
give 110 percent, and they have responded.
Exercises

lar60886_ch10_363-400.indd 391 10/14/23 11:48 am
One Sunday afternoon you decide to drive by the site and show it to your son. As 
you point out various parts of the project to your son, you discover that several 
pieces of valuable equipment are missing from the storage shed. When you start 
work again on Monday, you are about to discuss this matter with a supervisor 
when you realize that all the missing equipment is back in the shed. What should 
you do? Why?
The Project Status Report Meeting
You are driving to a project status report meeting with your client. You encountered a 
significant technical problem on the project that has put your project behind schedule. 
This is not good news because completion time is the number one priority for the proj￾ect. You are confident that your team can solve the problem if they are free to give 
their undivided attention to it and that with hard work you can get back on schedule. 
You also believe if you tell the client about the problem, she will demand a meeting 
with your team to discuss the implications of the problem. You can also expect her to 
send some of her personnel to oversee the solution to the problem. These interruptions 
will likely further delay the project. What should you tell your client about the current 
status of the project?
Gold Star LAN Project
You work for a large consulting firm and were assigned to the Gold Star LAN project. 
Work on the project is nearly completed and your clients at Gold Star appear to be 
pleased with your performance. During the course of the project, changes in the origi￾nal scope had to be made to accommodate specific needs of managers at Gold Star. 
The costs of these changes were documented as well as overhead and submitted to the 
centralized Accounting Department. They processed the information and submitted a 
change order bill for your signature. You are surprised to see the bill is 10 percent 
higher than what you submitted. You contact Jim Messina in the accounting office and 
ask if a mistake has been made. He curtly replies that no mistake was made and that 
management adjusted the bill. He recommends that you sign the document. You talk to 
another project manager about this and she tells you off the record that overcharging 
clients on change orders is common practice in your firm. Would you sign the docu￾ment? Why? Why not?
Cape Town Bio-Tech
You are responsible for installing the new Double E production line. Your team has 
collected estimates and used the WBS to generate a project schedule. You have confi￾dence in the schedule and the work your team has done. You report to top management 
that you believe the project will take 110 days and be completed by March 5. The news 
is greeted positively. In fact, the project sponsor confides that orders do not have to be 
shipped until April 1. You leave the meeting wondering whether you should share this 
information with the project team or not?
Ryman Pharmaceuticals
You are a test engineer on the Bridge project at Ryman Pharmaceuticals. You have 
just completed conductivity tests of a new electrochemical compound. The results 
exceeded expectations. This new compound should revolutionize the industry. You 
are wondering whether to call your stockbroker and ask him to buy $20,000 worth 
of Ryman stock before everyone else finds out about the results. What would you 
do and why?

Princeton Landing
You are managing the renovation of the Old Princeton Landing Bar and Grill. The 
project is on schedule despite receiving a late shipment of paint. The paint was sup￾posed to arrive on 1/30 but instead arrived on 2/1. The assistant store manager apolo￾gizes profusely for the delay and asks if you would be willing to sign the acceptance 
form and backdate it to 1/30. He says he won’t qualify for a bonus that he has worked 
hard to meet for the past month if the shipment is reported late. He promises to make 
it up to you on future projects. What would you do and why?

 Case 10.1
The Blue Sky Project*
Garth Hudson was a 29-year-old graduate of Eastern State University (ESU) with a BS 
degree in management information systems. After graduation, he worked for seven years 
at Bluegrass Systems in Louisville, Kentucky. While at ESU he worked part time for an 
oceanography professor, Ahmet Green, creating a customized database for a research 
project he was conducting. Green was recently appointed director of Eastern Oceanogra￾phy Institute (EOI), and Garth was confident that this prior experience was instrumental 
in his getting the job as information services (IS) director at the institute. Although he 
took a significant pay cut, he jumped at the opportunity to return to his alma mater. His 
job at Bluegrass Systems had been very demanding. The long hours and extensive trav￾eling had created tension in his marriage. He was looking forward to a normal job with 
reasonable hours. Besides, Jenna, his wife, would be busy pursuing her MBA at Eastern 
State University. While at Bluegrass, Garth worked on a wide range of IS projects. He 
was confident that he had the requisite technical expertise to excel at his new job.
Eastern Oceanography Institute was an independently funded research facility 
aligned with Eastern State University. Approximately 50 full- and part-time staff 
worked at the institute. They worked on research grants funded by the National Sci￾ence Foundation (NSF) and the United Nations (UN), as well as research financed by 
private industry. There were typically 7 to 9 major research projects under way at any 
one time, as well as 20 to 25 smaller projects. One-third of the institute’s scientists 
had part-time teaching assignments at ESU and used the institute to conduct their own 
basic research.
FIRST YEAR AT EOI
Garth made a point of introducing himself to the various groups of people upon his 
arrival at the institute. Still, his contact with the staff was limited. He spent most of his 
time becoming familiar with EOI’s information system, training his staff, responding 
to unexpected problems, and working on various projects. Garth suffered from food 
allergies and refrained from informal staff lunches at nearby restaurants. He stopped 
regularly attending the biweekly staff meetings in order to devote more time to his 
work. He only attended the meetings when there was a specific agenda item regarding 
his operation.
The IS staff at EOI consisted of two full-time assistants, Tom Jackson and Celeste 
Jackson. They were supported by five part-time student assistants from the Computer 
Science Department. Celeste Jackson was assigned full-time to a large five-year NSF 
grant aimed at creating a virtual library of oceanographic research. Celeste worked out 
of the project leader’s office and had very little interaction with Garth or Tom. Garth’s 
relationship with Tom was awkward from the start. He found out, after the fact, that 
Tom thought he would get the job as director. They never talked about it, but he sensed 
tension the first couple of months on the job. One of the problems was that he and Tom 
were totally different personalities. Tom was gregarious and very talkative. He had 
a habit of walking around the institute after lunch, talking to different scientists and 
researchers. Often this led to useful information. Garth, on the other hand, preferred to 
stay in his office, working on various assignments, and ventured out only when called

upon. While Garth felt Tom was not on top of the latest developments, as he was, he 
respected Tom’s work.
Last month the system was corrupted by a virus introduced over the Internet. Garth 
devoted an entire weekend to restoring the system to operation. A recurring headache 
was one of the servers, code-named “Poncho,” that would occasionally shut down for 
no apparent reason. Instead of replacing it, he decided to nurse Poncho along until 
it could be replaced. His work was frequently interrupted by frantic calls from staff 
researchers who needed immediate help on a variety of computer-related problems. 
He was shocked at how computer illiterate some of the researchers were and how he 
had to guide them through some of the basics of e-mail management and database 
configuration. He did find time to help Assistant Professor Amanda Johnson on a proj￾ect. Amanda was the only researcher to respond to Garth’s e-mail announcing that the 
IS staff was available to help on projects. Garth created a virtual project office on the 
Internet so that Amanda could collaborate with colleagues from institutes in Italy and 
Thailand on a UN research grant. He looked forward to the day when he could spend 
more time on fun projects like that.
THE BLUE SKY CONVERSION PROJECT
The “Blue Sky” conversion project began in earnest four months ago. Ahmet 
Green returned from Washington, D.C., with grim news. The economic downturn 
was going to lead to a dramatic reduction in funding. He anticipated as much as a 
25 percent reduction in annual budget over the next three to five years. This would 
lead to staff reductions and cutting of operating costs. One cost-cutting measure was 
moving IT operations to the “cloud.” Ahmet had first proposed the idea to Garth 
after attending a meeting with several directors of other institutes who faced similar 
financial challenges.
The basic strategy was to move all of the institute’s databases, software, and even 
hardware to a “private cloud.” Staff would use their current PCs to simply access 
more powerful machines over the Internet. These powerful machines could be parti￾tioned and configured differently according to the needs of research staff, giving each 
staff member his or her own virtual machine (VM). Staff could also access, use, and 
share virtual servers over the Internet as needed. Garth worked with the institute’s 
accountant on a cost/benefit analysis. From their standpoint it made perfect sense. 
First, the institute would not have to replace or upgrade aging computers and serv￾ers. Second, the institute would enjoy significant IT savings, since they would pay for 
only IT resources actually used. They would not have to make any major IT capital 
expenditures. Third, cloud computing would provide the scientists greater flexibility 
by accessing desired resources or software from anywhere at any time. And finally, 
once the system was up and running, the institute would no longer need the services of 
at least one full-time IT worker. Ahmet decided to name the project “Blue Sky” to put 
a positive spin on the conversion.
At first the associate directors balked at the idea. Some had a hard time conceptual￾izing what cloud computing meant. Others were worried about security and reliability. 
In the end they reluctantly signed off on the project when given alternative cost-cutting 
initiatives. Garth assured them that cloud computing was the wave of the future and 
setting up or accessing virtual machines on the “cloud” was as simple as setting up or 
accessing their G-mail account.
The conversion project would be completed in stages. The first stage was selecting 
a provider. The next stage was migrating non-mission critical information to the cloud. 
Final PDF to printer396 Chapter 10 Being an Effective Project Manager
lar60886_ch10_363-400.indd 396 10/14/23 11:48 am
The next stages would entail migrating each of the six big grant projects in waves to 
the cloud. The final stage would focus on the remaining smaller projects. Training 
would be an integral part of each stage. The institute would maintain a back-up for all 
the data until six months after complete conversion. After that the cloud service pro￾vider would be responsible for backing up the data.
At first Tom was excited about the project. He was savvy enough to realize that this 
was the future of computing and he was intrigued with how the whole system would 
work. His feelings soon changed when he started thinking about the potential ramifi￾cations for his job. He asked Garth more than once what the department would look 
like after the conversion. Garth replied vaguely that they would figure it out once the 
system was up and running.
A task force was formed, headed by Garth, to select a cloud service provider. Garth 
was surprised by how many choices there were. Plans and cost structures varied consid￾erably. After much deliberation the committee narrowed the choices to three. The first 
two were among the bigger providers in the industry, VMWARE and Microsoft. The 
third choice was a relatively new company, OpenRange, which offered a cheaper solu￾tion. Tom argued that even though the bigger providers would cost more, they were a 
much safer bet. Garth responded that he had confidence in OpenRange and cutting costs 
was the primary goal behind the project. In the end, Garth persuaded the committee 
to choose OpenRange. Not only would cost be significantly cheaper, but OpenRange 
would help in training the personnel. Garth liked this idea; training was not his strength, 
and he wasn’t looking forward to holding senior scientists’ hands through the process.
It took Garth and Tom six weeks to identify noncritical data. Garth worked on the 
back end while Tom met with staff to identify noncritical information. The motto was 
when in doubt, leave it out. The actual migration only took a couple of days. Training 
proved to be more problematic. The staff sent by OpenRange appeared to be straight 
out of college. While enthusiastic, they were inexperienced in the art of getting older 
staff to accept and use new technology. Many trainers had the habit of simply doing 
things for the staff instead of showing them how to do it themselves. It all came to a 
head when a power outage at the OpenRange storage system shut down and disrupted 
operations at the institute for 36 hours.
Ahmet held an emergency meeting. Garth reported that the power outage occurred 
in North East India and that OpenRange was expanding their back-up systems. Several 
members argued that the institute should switch to one of the bigger providers. When 
this came up, Garth looked at Tom and was relieved when he remained silent. In the 
end, Ahmet announced that it would be too costly to switch providers and Garth and 
his staff would have to make the conversion work. Tom stepped forward and volun￾teered to manage the training. Everyone agreed that the institute should hire three 
more part-time assistants to help the staff with the transition.
Garth worked behind the scenes, coordinating with his counterparts at OpenRange 
and planning the conversion of the next segment of the project. Tom worked closely 
with the OpenRange trainers and refocused their attention on teaching. Resistance was 
pretty high at first. Tom used his personal contacts within the institute to rally sup￾port for the change. He persuaded Garth to change the conversion schedule to begin 
with those projects in which the leads were most supportive of the change. Training 
improved and Tom created some useful training materials, including short videos on 
how to access the virtual machines.
One problem that occurred early in the process involved a graduate research assis￾tant who mistakenly hit the wrong commands and terminated her virtual machine 
instead of logging off. This resulted in complete loss of that machine’s data in the

cloud. Fortunately, the institute had back-up and Tom was able to recover the work. 
Collaborating with some programmers at OpenRange, Tom wrote a program that trig￾gered a pop-up message on the screen, warning users not to terminate their virtual 
machine when logging off.
CLOSING OUT THE BLUE SKY PROJECT
It took almost a year to complete the Blue Sky project. After the rocky beginning 
things went relatively smoothly. Acceptance was slow, but Tom and his staff worked 
with the staff to demonstrate how the new system would make their work easier. Two 
student assistants were always on call to address any problem or question. Garth spent 
most of his time interacting with the OpenRange counterparts and rarely ventured out 
of his office. He had his student assistants collect information from staff so he could 
configure the new virtual machines to exactly match staff needs. He put in long hours 
so that customized databases would work in the new environment. This proved to be 
a very difficult task and he was quite pleased with his work. Twice OpenRange expe￾rienced momentary power shortages at their server facility, which disrupted work at 
the institute. Garth was happy to report that OpenRange was breaking ground on an 
alternative server system in Ukraine.
When the institute conducted a retrospective (project review) on the Blue Sky proj￾ect, some still questioned the choice of OpenRange as a cloud service provider but 
praised Tom’s work on helping the staff make the transition. Despite the criticism over 
the choice of OpenRange, Garth felt good about the project. The system was up and 
running and the staff was beginning to enjoy the flexibility it provided. Besides, the 
institute would achieve real savings from the new system.
Soon after the retrospective, Garth was surprised when Ahmet walked into his 
office and closed the door. Ahmet began by thanking Garth for his work on the proj￾ect. He then cleared his throat and said, “You know, Garth, one of the consequences 
of Blue Sky is reducing our IT staff. Celeste is needed for the data library project. 
So it comes down to you or Tom. Frankly, there is general agreement among the 
associate directors that Tom is essential to the institute. I know this might come as a 
surprise to you, and before I make a decision I want to give you a chance to change 
my mind.”

 Case 10.2
Tom Bray
Tom Bray was mulling over today’s work schedule as he looked across the bay at the 
storm that was rolling in. It was the second official day of the Pegasus project and now 
the real work was about to begin.
Pegasus was a two-month renovation project for AtlantiCorp, a major financial 
institution headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. Tom’s group was responsible for 
installing the furniture and equipment in the newly renovated Accounts Receivable 
Final PDF to printer398 Chapter 10 Being an Effective Project Manager
lar60886_ch10_363-400.indd 398 10/14/23 11:48 am
Department on the third floor. The Pegasus project was a dedicated project team 
formed out of AtlantiCorp’s Facilities Department, with Tom as the project lead.
Tom was excited because this was his first major league project and he was looking 
forward to practicing a new management style—management by wandering around 
(MBWA). He had been exposed to MBWA in a business class in college, but it wasn’t 
until he attended an AtlantiCorp leadership training seminar that he decided to change 
how he managed people. The trainer was a devout MBWA champion (“You can’t man￾age people from a computer!”). Furthermore, the testimonies from his peers reinforced 
the difference that MBWA can make when it comes to working on projects.
Tom had joined the facilities group at AtlantiCorp five years earlier after working 
for Electronic Data Systems for six years. He quickly demonstrated technical com￾petencies and good work habits. He was encouraged to take all the internal project 
management workshops offered by AtlantiCorp. On his last two projects he served as 
assistant project manager responsible for procurement and contract management.
He had read books about the soft side of project management, and MBWA made 
sense—after all, people, not tools, get projects done. His boss had told him he needed 
to refine his people skills and work on developing rapport with team members. MBWA 
seemed like a perfect solution.
Tom reviewed the list of team member names; some of the foreign names were real 
tongue twisters. For example, one of his better workers was from Thailand and her 
name was Penphim Bhatravidhya. He practiced saying “Pen-pim Phat-tha-ra-vit.” He 
got up, tucked in his shirt, and walked out of his office and down to the floor where his 
team was busy unloading equipment.
Tom said “Hi” to the first few workers he met until he encountered Jack and three 
other workers. Jack was busy pulling hardware out of a box while his teammates were 
standing around, talking. Tom blurted, “Come on, guys, we’ve got work to do.” They 
quickly separated and began unloading boxes.
The rest of the visit seemed to go well. He helped Steve unload a heavy box and 
managed to get an appreciative grin from Penphim when he almost correctly pro￾nounced her name. Satisfied, Tom went back up to his office, thinking that MBWA 
wouldn’t be that tough to do.
After responding to e-mails and calling some vendors, Tom ventured back out to see 
how things were going downstairs. When he got there, the floor was weirdly quiet. Peo￾ple were busy doing their work, and his attempts at generating conversation elicited stiff 
responses. He left thinking that maybe MBWA is going to be tougher than he thought.

Cerberus Corporation*
Cerberus is a successful producer of specialty chemicals. It operates nine large campus 
sites in the United States, with a number of different business units on each site. These 
business units operate independently, with direct reporting to corporate headquarters.

Site functions such as safety, environmental, and facilities management report to a host 
organization—typically the business unit that is the largest user of their services.
SUSAN STEELE
Susan Steele has worked in the facilities group at the Cerberus Richmond site for the 
last two years. The facilities manager, Tom Stern, reports to the general manager of 
the largest business unit on-site, the highly profitable Adhesives and Sealants Divi￾sion. Susan started with Cerberus when she graduated with her business degree from 
Awsum University. She was excited about her new assignment—leading a project for 
the first time. She remembered Tom saying, “We’ve got office furniture dating back 
to the ’80s. There are those ugly green-top desks that look like they came from mili￾tary surplus! I’m especially concerned about computer workstation ergonomics—it’s 
a major issue that we absolutely must fix! I want you to lead a project to transition our 
office furniture to the new corporate standard.”
Susan assembled her project team: Jeff, the site safety/ergonomics engineer; 
Gretchen, the space planner; Cindy, the move coordinator; and Kari, the accounting 
liaison for Facilities. At their first meeting, everyone agreed that ergonomics was the 
most urgent concern. All five business units responded to a workstation survey that 
identified injury-causing ergonomics. The team was developing a plan to replace old 
desks with new, ergo-adjustable furniture by the end of the year. Susan asked Kari 
about the budget, and Kari responded, “Facilities should not pay for this. We want the 
individual business units to pay so that the costs will show where they are incurred.”
Gretchen spoke up: “You know, we’ve got lots of department moves going on con￾stantly. Everybody is always jockeying for space and location as their business needs 
change. Besides the ergonomics, could we say that only corporate standard furniture 
gets moved? That would force changing some of the stuff that’s just plain ugly.” Every￾one agreed that this was a great idea.
Susan presented the project plan to Tom and got a green light to proceed.
JON WOOD
Jon Wood is a planning manager, with 22 years’ experience at Cerberus. His business 
unit, Photographic Chemicals Division (PCD), is losing money. Digital photography 
is continuing to reduce the size of the market, and PCD is having trouble matching the 
competition’s relentless price-cutting. Jon recently transferred to Richmond from cor￾porate headquarters, where he ran the economic forecasting group. He is considered a 
new broom, and he is determined to sweep clean.
One of Jon’s early actions was to negotiate with his general manager for a depart￾ment move. Money was tight, and the site facilities function charged an arm and a leg 
for moves (covering all their fixed overhead, the operations people groused). However, 
Jon felt it was important to move from Building 4, where they were next to Production, 
to Building 6, where they could be close to Marketing, Forecasting, and Accounting. 
His general manager agreed, and there was lots of excitement in his team about their 
upcoming move. Jon assigned one of his planners, Richard, to work with the facilities 
team on the layout and move plan for the group. Things seemed to be going fine—Jon 
saw Richard sitting down with the move coordinator, and they seemed to be on track.
The day before the move, Jon hung up the phone from a particularly tense telecon￾ference with a Canadian subcontractor. Production was not going well, and product 
availability would be tight for the rest of the quarter. Clustered around his desk were 
Richard, Cindy, and a person he hadn’t met yet, Susan. After hurried introductions, 
Final PDF to printer400 Chapter 10 Being an Effective Project Manager
lar60886_ch10_363-400.indd 400 10/14/23 11:48 am
Susan told Jon that his filing cabinets could not be moved. The cabinets are large lat￾eral files, 5 feet wide and 2 feet deep, a combination of both filing cabinets and book￾shelves. Jon brought them with him from corporate headquarters because he thought 
they looked nice with their dark grey steel sides and wood veneer tops. Susan told him 
that he would have to replace them with new corporate standard cabinets, virtually 
the same size. Jon said, “You mean you want me to throw away perfectly good filing 
cabinets and spend another $2,000 on new ones, just so they match? I won’t do it!”
Susan replied, “Then I won’t authorize the movement of the old cabinets.”
Jon said, “You’re joking—these cabinets are grey, the new ones are grey—the only 
difference is the wood top! You’d throw away $2,000 for nothing?”
Susan replied stiffly, “I’m sorry, that’s the policy.”
Jon said, “I don’t care what the policy is. If I have to move them myself, those 
cabinets are not going to the dump. My division is losing money and I’m not going to 
throw money away. If you don’t like it, you’re going to have to get your general man￾ager to convince my general manager to make me do it. Now would you please leave 
so I can get some work done.”

Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working 
together is success.
—Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Co.
The magic and power of teams are captured in the term synergy, which is derived from 
the Greek word sunergos: “working together.” There is positive and negative synergy. 
The essence of positive synergy can be found in the statement “The whole is greater 
than the sum of the parts.” Conversely, negative synergy occurs when the whole is less 
than the sum of the parts. Mathematically, these two states can be symbolized by the 
following equations:
Positive Synergy 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10
Negative Synergy 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 2 (or even−2)
Synergy perhaps can best be seen on a basketball court, a soccer pitch, or a football 
field where teammates play as one to defeat a superior foe (see Snapshot from Practice 
11.1: The 2008 Olympic Redeem Team).
Although less visible than in team sports, positive and negative synergy can also be 
observed and felt in the daily operations of project teams. Here is a description from 
one team member: 
Instead of operating as one big team we fractionalized into a series of subgroups. The mar￾keting people stuck together as well as the systems guys. A lot of time was wasted gossiping 
and complaining about each other. When the project started slipping behind schedule, every￾one started covering their tracks and trying to pass the blame on to others. After a while we 
avoided direct conversation and resorted to e-mail. Management finally pulled the plug and 
brought in another team to salvage the project. It was one of the worst project management 
experiences in my life.

lar60886_ch11_401-444.indd 403 10/14/23 10:14 am
In the 2004 Olympics in Athens, 12 
years after Magic Johnson and Michael 
Jordan led the U.S. Dream Team to 
Olympic gold in Barcelona, the U.S. 
Basketball Team, composed of NBA 
stars, lost not once but three times to international 
competition. For the first time in Olympic history, the 
United States settled for a bronze medal in men’s bas￾ketball. Basketball was no longer America’s game.
An autopsy of the debacle in Athens turned up a 
severe case of negative synergy. The causes were 
many. The team featured only three holdovers from the 
group that had qualified the previous summer. Seven 
of the original invitees withdrew. In the end, 14 play￾ers turned down Uncle Sam, invoking excuses from 
family obligations to nagging injuries to the security 
situation in Greece. As a result, coach Larry Brown took 
charge of a team with an average age of 23 years, and 
it showed. Behind the scenes, problems of dress and 
punctuality festered and, on the eve of the games, 
Brown wanted to send several players home. The 
million-dollar players were overconfident and assumed 
that their individual brilliance would prevail. An over￾reliance on one-on-one basketball and poor team 
defense doomed them as they lost games to Puerto 
Rico, Lithuania, and Argentina.
Enter Jerry Colangelo, 68, former coach, player, 
and president of the Phoenix Suns. “The way they 
conducted themselves left a lot to be desired,” he 
says of the 2004 team. “Watching and listening to 
how people reacted to our players, I knew we’d hit 
bottom.” Colangelo told NBA commissioner David 
Stern that he would only assume duties as managing 
director if he was given complete control. As a mea￾sure of how abysmal the situation was, he immedi￾ately got what he asked for.
In 2005 Colangelo met face-to-face with every 
prospective national player, to hear in their own words 
why they wanted to represent their country. The few 
good men to set things right wouldn’t be paid or guar￾anteed playing time, much less a starting spot. A key 
recruit was superstar LeBron James, who had been 
tagged “LeBronze” after his performance on the dis￾appointing 2004 team. Colangelo says, “I got buy-in. 
Halfway through my talk with him, LeBron said, I’m in.” 
Kobe Bryant soon followed and all but 2 of the 30 top 
NBA stars accepted Colangelo’s offer.
Mike Krzyzewski, the college coach at Duke, was 
hired with one project objective in mind—win the gold 
medal. To do so he had to change the attitude of team 
USA. They had to subordinate their superstar egos and 
buy in to the concept of team ball. A blessing in dis￾guise was being knocked out of the 2006 world cham￾pionship by a Greek team. The players came away from 
that disappointment committed to team ball as extra 
passes became the staple in practices. The change in 
attitude was evident in more subtle ways. The USA on 
the uniforms was bright red, while the players’ names 
were muted blue. The players no longer referred to 
hoops as “our game” and spoke about how it had 
become the world’s game. Even the team’s official 
slogan (United We Rise) and unofficial nickname (the 
Redeem Team) implied room for improvement.
The team bought into a common objective. Team 
USA marched to the final gold medal game by beat￾ing opponents by an average margin of 30+ points. 
Experts marveled not so much at the victory margin 
but at how well they played as a team. “Our goal is to 
win a gold medal and be humble about it,” said Jason 
Kidd, six-time all-pro point guard, “and if we do it by 
50, to make sure it’s because we’re playing the right 
way.” Nothing exemplified the right way more than a 
moment in the final, in which flawless ball movement 
from the Redeemers for 16 seconds, without a dribble 
being taken, culminated with Dwight Howard receiving 
a perfect pass for an uncontested dunk.
In the end, they didn’t dominate the gold medal 
game. Spain proved to be inspired opponents. They 
simply closed the game out and for the first time since 
NBA players have gone to the Olympics, the USA 
played as a team rather than showboating individuals.

Fortunately, the same individual was also able to recount a more positive experience: 
There was a contagious excitement within the team. Sure, we had our share of problems and 
setbacks, but we dealt with them straight on and, at times, were able to do the impossible. 
We all cared about the project and looked out for each other. At the same time we challenged 
each other to do better. It was one of the most exciting times in my life.
The following is a set of characteristics commonly associated with high-performing 
teams that exhibit positive synergy1
:
1. The team shares a sense of common purpose, and each member is willing to work 
toward achieving project objectives.
2. The team identifies individual talents and expertise and uses them, depending on 
the project’s needs at any given time. At these times, the team willingly accepts 
the influence and leadership of the members whose skills are relevant to the 
immediate task.
3. Roles are balanced and shared to facilitate both the accomplishment of tasks and 
feelings of group cohesion and morale.
4. The team exerts energy toward problem solving rather than allowing itself to be 
drained by interpersonal issues or competitive struggles.
5. Differences of opinion are encouraged and freely expressed.
6. To encourage risk taking and creativity, mistakes are treated as opportunities for 
learning rather than reasons for punishment.
7. Members set high personal standards of performance and encourage each other to 
realize the objectives of the project.
8. Members identify with the team and consider it an important source of both profes￾sional and personal growth.
High-performing teams become champions, create breakthrough products, exceed 
customer expectations, and overcome project obstacles. They are bonded together 
by mutual interdependency and a common goal or vision. They trust each other and 
exhibit a high level of collaboration.
11.1 The Five-Stage Team Development Model
Many experts argue that just as infants develop in certain ways during their first 
months of life, groups develop in a predictable manner. One of the most popular mod￾els identifies five stages (see Figure 11.1) through which groups develop into effective 
teams (Tuckman, 1965; Tuckman & Jensen, 1977): 
1. Forming. During this initial stage, the members get acquainted with each other and 
understand the scope of the project. They begin to establish ground rules by trying 
to find out what behaviors are acceptable with respect to both the project (what 
role they will play, what performance expectations are) and interpersonal relations 
(who’s really in charge). This stage is completed once members begin to think of 
themselves as part of a group.
2. Storming. As the name suggests, this stage is marked by a high degree of inter￾nal conflict. Members accept that they are part of a project group but resist the

constraints that the project and group put on their individuality. There is conflict 
over who will control the group and how decisions will be made. As these conflicts 
are resolved, the project manager’s leadership becomes accepted, and the group 
moves to the next stage.
3. Norming. The third stage is one in which close relationships develop and the group 
demonstrates cohesiveness. Feelings of camaraderie and shared responsibility for 
the project are heightened. The norming phase is complete when the group struc￾ture solidifies and the group establishes a common set of expectations about how 
members should work together.
4. Performing. The team operating structure at this point is fully functional and 
accepted. Group energy has moved from getting to know each other and how the 
group will work together to accomplishing the project goals.
5. Adjourning. For conventional work groups, performing is the last stage of their 
development. However, for project teams, there is a completion phase. During this 
stage, the team prepares for its own disbandment. High performance is no longer 
a top priority. Instead, attention is devoted to wrapping up the project. The mem￾bers’ responses vary in this stage. Some members are upbeat, basking in the project 
team’s accomplishments. Others may be depressed over the loss of camaraderie and 
friendships gained during the project’s life.
This model has several implications for those working on project teams. The first is 
that the model provides a framework for the group to understand its own development. 
Project managers have found it useful to share the model with their teams. It helps 
members accept the tensions of the storming phase, and it directs their focus to move 
toward the more productive phases. Another implication is that it stresses the impor￾tance of the norming phase, which contributes significantly to the level of productiv￾ity experienced during the performing phase. Project managers, as we will see, have

to take an active role in shaping group norms that will contribute to ultimate project 
success. For an alternative model of group development see Research Highlight 11.1: 
The Punctuated Equilibrium Model of Group Development.
11.2 Situational Factors Affecting Team Development
Experience and research indicate that high-performance project teams are much more 
likely to develop under the following conditions.
2
∙ There are 10 or fewer members per team.
∙ Members volunteer to serve on the project team.
∙ Members serve on the project from beginning to end.
∙ Members are assigned to the project full time.
∙ Members are part of an organizational culture that fosters cooperation and trust.
∙ Members report solely to the project manager.
∙ All relevant functional areas are represented on the team.
∙ The project involves a compelling objective.
∙ Members are located within conversational distance of each other.
In reality, it is rare that a project manager is assigned a project that meets all of these 
conditions. For example, many projects’ requirements dictate the active involvement 
of more than 10 members and may consist of a complex set of interlocking teams 
comprising more than 100 professionals. In many organizations, functional managers 
or central manpower offices assign project members with little input from the proj￾ect manager. To optimize resource utilization, team member involvement may be part 
time, and/or participants may move into and out of the project team on an as-needed 
basis. In the case of ad hoc task forces, no member of the team works full time on the 
project. In many corporations, an NIH (not invented here) culture discourages collabo￾ration across functional boundaries.
Team members often report to different managers, and in some cases, the project 
manager has no direct input over performance appraisals and advancement opportuni￾ties of team members. Key functional areas may not be represented during the entire 
duration of the project but may only be involved in a sequential manner. Not all proj￾ects have a compelling objective. It can be hard to get members excited about mundane 
projects such as a simple product extension or a conventional apartment complex. 
Finally, team members are often scattered across different corporate offices and build￾ings or, across the entire globe.
It is important for project managers and team members to recognize the situational 
constraints they are operating under and do the best they can. It is naive to believe that 
every project team has the same potential to evolve into a high-performance team. 
Under less-than-ideal conditions, it may be a struggle just to meet project objectives. 
Ingenuity, discipline, and sensitivity to team dynamics are essential to maximizing the 
performance of a project team.

Connie Gersick’s research sug￾gests that groups don’t develop 
in a universal sequence of stages, 
as suggested by the five-phase 
model. Her research, which is 
based on the systems concept of 
punctuated equilibrium, found that the timing of 
when groups form and actually change the way 
they work is highly consistent. What makes this 
research appealing is that it is based on studies of 
more than a dozen field and laboratory task forces 
assigned to complete a specific project.
Gersick’s research reveals that each group 
begins with a unique approach to accomplishing its 
project, which is set in its first meeting and includes 
the behavior and roles that dominate phase I. 
Phase I continues until one-half of the allotted time 
for project completion has expired (regardless of 
actual amount of time). At this midpoint, a major 
transition occurs that includes the dropping of the 
group’s old norms and behavior patterns and the 
emergence of new behavior and working relation￾ships that contribute to increased progress toward 
completing the project. The last meeting is marked 
by accelerated activity to complete the project. 
These findings are summarized in Figure 11.2.
The remarkable discovery in these studies 
was that each group experienced its transition at 
the same point in its calendar—roughly halfway 
between the first meeting and the completion 
deadline—despite the fact that some groups spent 
as little as an hour on their project, while others 
spent six months. It was as if the groups univer￾sally experienced a midlife crisis at this point. The 
midpoint appeared to work like an alarm clock, 
heightening members’ awareness that time was 
limited and they needed to get moving. Within 
the context of the five-stage model, it suggests 
that groups begin by combining the forming and 
norming stages, then go through a period of low 
performing, followed by storming, then a period of 
high performing, and finally adjourning.
Gersick’s findings suggest that there are natural 
transition points during the life of teams in which 
the group is receptive to change and that such a 
moment naturally occurs at the midpoint of a project. 
However, a manager does not want to have to wait 6 
months on a complicated 12-month project for a team 
to get its act together! Here it is important to note that 
Gersick’s groups were working on relatively small￾scale projects, such as a 4-person bank task force in 
charge of designing a new bank account in 1 month 
and a 12-person medical task force in charge of 
reorganizing two units of a treatment facility. In most 
cases, no formal project plan was established.
The results point to the importance of good 
project management and the need to establish 
deadlines and milestones. By imposing a series of 
deadlines associated with important milestones, 
it is possible to create multiple transition points 
for natural group development. For example, a 
12-month construction project can be broken down 
into six to eight significant milestones with the chal￾lenge of meeting each deadline producing the pre￾requisite tension for elevating team performance.

11.3 Building High-Performance Project Teams
Project managers play a key role in developing high-performance project teams. 
They recruit members, conduct meetings, establish a team identity, create a common 
sense of purpose or a shared vision, manage a reward system that encourages team￾work, orchestrate decision making, resolve conflicts that emerge within the team, 
and rejuvenate the team when energy wanes (see Figure 11.3). Project managers 
take advantage of situational factors that naturally contribute to team development 
while improvising around those factors that inhibit team development. In doing so 
they exhibit a highly interactive management style that exemplifies teamwork and, 
as discussed in Chapter 10, manage the interface between the team and the rest of 
the organization. 
Recruiting Project Members
The process of selecting and recruiting project members will vary across organiza￾tions. Two important factors affecting recruitment are the importance of the project 
and the management structure being used to complete the project. Often for high￾priority projects that are critical to the future of the organization, the project managers 
will be given virtual carte blanche to select whomever they deem necessary. For less 
significant projects, personnel will simply be assigned to the project.
In many matrix structures, the functional manager controls who is assigned to the 
project; the project manager will have to work with the functional manager to obtain 
the necessary personnel. Even in a project team where members are selected and 
assigned full time to the project, the project manager has to be sensitive to the needs 
of others. There is no better way to create enemies within an organization than to be 
perceived as unnecessarily robbing other departments of essential personnel.
Experienced project managers stress the importance of asking for volunteers. How￾ever, this desirable step often is outside the manager’s control. Still, the value of hav￾ing team members volunteer for the project as opposed to being assigned cannot be 
overlooked. Agreeing to work on the project is the first step toward building personal 
commitment to the project. Such commitment will be essential to maintain motivation 
when the project hits hard times and extra effort is required.

When selecting and recruiting team members, project managers naturally look for 
individuals with the necessary experience and knowledge/technical skills critical for 
project completion. At the same time, there are less obvious considerations that need 
to be factored into the recruitment process:
∙ Problem-solving ability. If the project is complex and fuzzy, then a manager 
wants people who are good at working under uncertainty and have strong problem￾identification and problem-solving skills. These people are likely to be bored and 
less productive working on straightforward projects that go by the book.
∙ Availability. Sometimes the people who are most available are not the ones wanted 
for the team. Conversely, if members recruited are already overcommitted, they 
may not be able to offer much.
∙ Technological expertise. Managers should be wary of people who know too much 
about a specific technology. They may be technology buffs who like to study but 
have a hard time doing the work.
∙ Credibility. The credibility of the project is enhanced by the reputation of the peo￾ple involved in it. Recruiting a sufficient number of “winners” lends confidence to 
the project.
∙ Political connections. Managers are wise to recruit individuals who already have a 
good working relationship with key stakeholders. This is particularly true for projects 
operating in a matrix environment in which a significant portion of the work will be 
under the domain of a specific functional department and not the core project team.
∙ Ambition, initiative, and energy. These qualities can make up for a lot of short￾comings in other areas and should not be underestimated.
∙ Familiarity. Research suggests that repeat collaboration stifles creativity and innova￾tion. On challenging, breakthrough projects it is wise to interject the team with experts 
who have little previous working experience with others (Skilton & Dooley, 2010).
After reviewing the needed skills, the manager should try to find out through the 
corporate grapevine who is good, who is available, and who might want to work on the 
project. Some organizations may allow direct interviews. Often a manager will have to 
expend political capital to get highly prized people assigned to the project.
In matrix environments, the project manager will have to request appointments with 
functional managers to discuss the project requirements for staffing. The following 
documents should be available at these discussions: an overall project scope statement, 
endorsements of top management, and a description of the tasks and general schedule 
that pertain to the people from their departments. Managers need to be precise as to 
what attributes they are seeking and why they are important.
Conducting Project Meetings
The First Project Team Meeting Research on team development confirms what 
project managers have stated: the project kick-off meeting is critical to the early 
functioning of the project team. According to one veteran project manager,
The first team meeting sets the tone for how the team will work together. If it is disorganized, 
or becomes bogged down with little sense of closure, then this can often become a self- ful￾filling prophecy for subsequent group work. On the other hand, if it is crisply run, focusing 
on real issues and concerns in an honest and straightforward manner, members come away 
excited about being part of the project team.

There are typically three objectives project managers try to achieve during the 
first meeting of the project team. The first is to provide an overview of the project, 
including the scope and objectives, general schedule, method, and procedures. The 
second is to begin to address some of the interpersonal concerns captured in the 
team development model: Who are the other team members? How will I fit in? 
Will I be able to work with these people? The third and most important objective 
is to begin to model how the team is going to work together to complete the proj￾ect. Project managers need to recognize that first impressions are important; their 
behavior will be carefully monitored and interpreted by team members. This meet￾ing should serve as an exemplary role model for subsequent meetings and reflect 
the leader’s style.
The meeting itself takes a variety of forms. It is not uncommon in major projects 
for the kick-off meeting to involve one or two days, often at a remote site away from 
interruptions. This retreat provides sufficient time to complete a preliminary intro￾duction, to begin to establish ground rules, and to define the structure of the project. 
One advantage of off-site kick-off meetings is that they provide ample opportunity 
for informal interaction among members during breaks, meals, and evening activities; 
such informal interactions are critical to forming relationships.
However, many organizations do not have the luxury of holding elaborate retreats. 
In other cases, the scope of a project does not warrant such an investment of time. In 
these cases, the key operating principle should be KISS (keep it simple, stupid!). Too 
often when constrained by time, project managers try to accomplish too much dur￾ing the first meeting; in such instances, issues do not get fully resolved, and members 
come away with an information headache.
The project manager needs to remember that the primary goal is to run a productive 
meeting, and objectives should be realistic, given the time available. If the meeting is 
only one hour, then the project manager should simply review the scope of the project, 
discuss how the team was formed, and provide an opportunity for members to intro￾duce themselves to the team.
Establishing Ground Rules Whether as part of an elaborate first meeting or dur￾ing follow-up meetings, the project manager must quickly begin to establish opera￾tional ground rules for how the team will work together. These ground rules involve 
not only organizational and procedural issues but also normative issues on how the 
team will interact with each other. Although specific procedures will vary across 
organizations and projects, some of the major issues that need to be addressed 
include the following:
Planning Decisions
∙ How will the project plan be developed?
∙ Will a specific project management software package be used? If so, which one?
∙ What are the specific roles and responsibilities of all the participants?
∙ Who needs to be informed of decisions? How will they be kept informed?
∙ What is the relative importance of cost, time, and performance?
∙ What are the deliverables of the project planning process?
∙ Who will approve and sign off at the completion of each deliverable?
∙ Who receives each deliverable?
Final PDF to printerChapter 11 Managing Project Teams 411
lar60886_ch11_401-444.indd 411 10/14/23 10:14 am
Tracking Decisions
∙ How will progress be assessed?
∙ At what level of detail will the project be tracked?
∙ How will team members get data from each other?
∙ How often will they get these data?
∙ Who will generate and distribute reports?
∙ Who needs to be kept informed about project progress, and how will they be 
informed?
∙ What content/format is appropriate for each audience?
∙ Meetings
 – Where will meetings be located?
 – What kind of meetings will be held?
 – Who will run these meetings?
 – How will agendas be produced?
 – How will information be recorded?
Managing Change Decisions
∙ How will changes be instituted?
∙ Who will have change approval authority?
∙ How will plan changes be documented and evaluated?
Relationship Decisions
∙ What department or organizations will the team need to interact with during the 
project?
∙ What are the roles and responsibilities of each organization (reviewer, approver, 
creator, user)?
∙ How will all involved parties be kept informed of deliverables, schedule dates, 
expectations, etc.?
∙ How will the team members communicate among themselves?
∙ What information will and won’t be exchanged?
Checklists like these are only a guide; items should be added or deleted as needed. 
Many of these procedures will have already been established by precedent and will 
only have to be briefly reviewed. For example, Microsoft Project or Primavera may 
be the standard software for planning and tracking. Likewise, a firm is likely to 
have an established format for reporting status information. How to deal with other 
issues will have to be determined by the project team. When appropriate, the project 
manager should actively solicit input from the project team members and draw upon 
their experience and preferred work habits. This process also contributes to their 
buying into the operational decisions. Decisions should be recorded and circulated 
to all members.
Establishing Team Norms
During the course of establishing these operational procedures, the project manager, 
through word and deed, should begin working with members to establish the norms 
Final PDF to printer412 Chapter 11 Managing Project Teams
lar60886_ch11_401-444.indd 412 10/14/23 10:14 am
for team interaction. Following are examples of some of the norms researchers have 
found to be associated with high-performance teams.3
∙ Confidentiality is maintained; no information is shared outside the team unless all 
agree to it.
∙ It is acceptable to be in trouble, but it is not acceptable to surprise others. Tell oth￾ers immediately when deadlines or milestones will not be reached.
∙ There is zero tolerance for bullying a way through a problem or an issue.
∙ Agree to disagree, but when a decision has been made, regardless of personal feel￾ings, move forward.
∙ Respect outsiders, and do not flaunt one’s position on the project team.
∙ Hard work does not get in the way of having fun.
One way of making these norms more tangible is by creating a team charter that 
goes beyond the scope statement of the project and states in explicit terms the norms 
and values of the team. This charter should be a collaborative effort on the part of the 
core team. Project managers can lead by proposing certain tenets, but they need to 
be open to suggestions from the team. Once there is general agreement to the rules 
of conduct, each member signs the final document to symbolize commitment to the 
principles it contains.
Unfortunately, in some cases creating a charter becomes a meaningless ritual 
because the charter is signed and filed away, never to be discussed again. To have 
a lasting effect, the charter has to be a legitimate part of the project monitoring sys￾tem. Just as the team reviews progress toward project objectives, the team assesses the 
extent to which members are adhering to the principles in the charter.
Project managers play a major role in establishing team norms through personal 
example. If they freely admit mistakes and share what they have learned from them, 
other team members will do the same. At the same time, project managers need 
to intervene when they believe such norms are being violated. They should talk to 
offenders privately and clearly state their expectations. The amazing thing about 
groups is that once a group is cohesive, with well-established norms, the members 
will police themselves so that the manager doesn’t have to be the heavy. For exam￾ple, one project manager confided that the project team had a practice of having a 
small bean bag present at every meeting. If any one member felt that a colleague 
was shading the truth, s/he was obligated to toss the bean bag at the speaker. See 
Snapshot from Practice 11.2: Putting Ford on Fast Forward for examples of norms 
that encourage innovation.
Managing Subsequent Project Meetings The project kick-off meeting is one of sev￾eral kinds of meetings required to complete a project. Others are status report meet￾ings, problem-solving meetings, and audit meetings. Issues unique to these meetings 
will be discussed in subsequent chapters. For now, here are some general guidelines 
for running effective meetings; they speak directly to the person chairing the meeting.
∙ Start meetings on time regardless of whether everyone is present.
∙ Prepare and distribute an agenda prior to the meeting.

∙ Identify an adjournment time.
∙ Periodically take time to review how effective previous meetings have been.
∙ Solicit recommendations and implement changes.
∙ Assign good recordkeeping.
∙ Review the agenda before beginning, and tentatively allocate time for each item.
∙ Prioritize issues so that adjustments can be made, given time constraints.
∙ Encourage active participation of all members by asking questions instead of mak￾ing statements.
∙ Summarize decisions, and review assignments for the next meeting.
∙ Prepare and distribute a summary of the meeting to the appropriate people.
∙ Recognize accomplishments and positive behavior.
Meetings are often considered anathema to productivity, but this does not have to be 
the case. The most common complaint is that meetings last too long. Establishing an 
agenda and adjournment time helps participants budget discussion time and provides 
a basis for expediting the proceedings. Recordkeeping can be an unwelcome, tedious 
task. Utilizing laptop computers to record decisions and information in real time can 
facilitate the communication process. Careful preparation and consistent application 
of these guidelines can make meetings a vital part of projects.
Adam Gryglak was given mission 
impossible: deliver an all-new Ford 
diesel engine in less than 36 months. 
The challenge was all the more daunt￾ing in that in the past Ford had out￾sourced the design and manufacture of diesel engines 
to Navistar. Not only did he have to meet a ridiculous 
deadline, but he also had to build an in-house engine 
from scratch. Gryglak, the chief diesel engineer, knew 
that success depended on short-circuiting the design 
process at Ford. So he put together a team of hungry 
engineers, moved off-site, and shielded the team from 
anxious top management. He called the project Scor￾pion after the heavy metal band the Scorpions.
Progress was immediate. Specialists who were 
used to working only with their own kind became 
familiar with what the other engineers were up to. “We 
saved months by knowing hourly what the other guys 
were thinking and what their problems were,” says Pat 
Morgan, a veteran Ford engineer. “The result was that 
the engine fit into the truck perfectly the first time, and 
that almost never happens.”
Gryglak also realized that engineers work harder 
and smarter when they are having fun. To relieve 
pressure, the engineers played jokes on each other, 
building full-size snowmen decorated with machine 
parts on each other’s desks. Gryglak encouraged 
friendly competition. After hitting a critical design mile￾stone the team organized a Pinewood Derby contest. 
Pinewood Derby is a famous Cub Scout event where 
young boys whittle toy cars out of wood and race them 
down a ramp. These were engineers, not Cub Scouts, 
so instead of wooden cars, the engineers milled cars 
out of aluminum. Some of the cars even had remote 
controls and engines.
The fun culture paid off. The new Ford diesel engine 
was completed on time to critical acclaim. The engine 
was the first of its kind to use state-of-the-art antipollu￾tion technology that met new federal standards. It also 
had the best fuel economy in its category and wouldn’t 
need significant maintenance for 300,000 miles. The 
engine was featured in the best-selling F-150 line of 
trucks and was considered one of the keys to Ford’s 
comeback.

Establishing a Team Identity
One of the challenges project managers often face in building a team is the lack of full￾time involvement of team members. Specialists work on different phases of the project 
and spend the majority of their time and energy elsewhere. They are often members of 
multiple teams, each competing for their time and allegiance. Project expert J. D. Frame 
(1995) points out that for many of these specialists, a specific project is an abstraction; as 
a consequence, their level of motivation suffers. Project managers need to make the proj￾ect team as tangible as possible to the participants by developing a unique team identity 
to which participants can become emotionally attached. Team meetings, co-location of 
team members, team names, and team rituals are common vehicles for doing so.
∙ Effective use of meetings. Periodic team meetings provide an important forum for 
communicating project information. A less obvious function of project meetings is 
to help establish a concrete team identity. During project meetings, members see 
that they are not working alone. They are part of a larger project team, and project 
success depends on the collective efforts of all the team members. Timely gather￾ings of all the project participants help define team membership and reinforce a 
collective identity.
∙ Co-location of team members. The most obvious way to make the project team 
tangible is to have members work together in a common space. This is not always 
possible in matrix environments where involvement is part time and members are 
working on other projects and activities. A worthwhile substitute for co-location is 
the creation of a project office, sometimes referred to as the project war room or 
clubhouse. Such rooms are the common meeting place and contain the most signifi￾cant project documentation. Frequently, their walls are covered with Gantt charts, 
cost graphs, and other outputs associated with project planning and control. These 
rooms serve as a tangible sign of project effort.
∙ Creation of project team name. The development of a team name such as the 
“A-Team” or “Casey’s Crusaders” is a common device for making a team more tan￾gible. Frequently an associated team logo is also created. Again, the project manager 
should rely on the collective ingenuity of the team to come up with the appropriate 
name and logo. Such symbols then can be affixed to stationery, T-shirts, coffee 
mugs, and so on to help signify team membership.
∙ Get the team to build or do something together early on. Nothing reinforces a 
sense of a team more than working on something together. In the case of one inter￾national project, the manager simply hosted a potluck dinner where the members 
brought dishes their countries were famous for.
∙ Team rituals. Just as corporate rituals help establish the unique identity of a firm, 
similar symbolic actions at the project level can contribute to a unique team subcul￾ture. For example, on one project, members were given ties with stripes that corre￾sponded to the number of milestones on the project. After reaching each milestone, 
the members gathered and cut the next stripe off their ties to signify progress.4
 Katz 
(2004) reports it was common practice for Digital Equipment’s alpha chip design 
team to recognize people who found a bug in the design by giving them a phospho￾rescent toy roach. The bigger the bug that was discovered, the bigger the toy roach 
received. Such rituals help set project work apart from mainstream operations and 
reinforce a special status.

Creating a Shared Vision
Unlike project scope statements, which include specific cost, completion dates, 
and performance requirements, a project vision involves the less tangible aspects 
of project performance. A project vision is an image project team members hold 
in common about how the project will look upon completion, how they will work 
together, and/or how customers will accept the project. At its simplest level, a shared 
vision is the answer to the question “What do we want to create?” Not everyone will 
have the same vision, but the images should be similar. Visions come in a variety 
of forms; they can be captured in a slogan or symbol or can be written as a formal 
vision statement.
What a vision is, is not as important as what it does. A vision inspires members 
to give their best effort. (See Snapshot from Practice 11.3: A Good Man in a Storm.) 
Moreover, a shared vision unites professionals with different backgrounds and agen￾das to a common aspiration. It helps motivate members to subordinate their individual 
agendas and do what is best for the project. As psychologist Robert Fritz puts it, “In 
the presence of greatness, pettiness disappears.”5
 Visions also provide focus and help 
communicate less tangible priorities, helping members make appropriate judgment 
calls. Finally, a shared vision for a project fosters commitment to the long term and 
discourages expedient responses that collectively dilute the quality of the project.
Visions can be surprisingly simple. For example, the vision for a new car could be 
expressed as a “pocket rocket.” Compare this vision with the more traditional product 
description—“a sports car in the midprice range.” The “pocket rocket” vision provides 
a much clearer picture of what the final product should be. Design engineers would 
immediately understand that the car will be both small and fast and that the car should 
be quick at the getaway, nimble in the turns, and very fast in the straightaways (Bowen 
et al., 1994). Alternatively, visions can be more concrete: “The Helpdesk Automated 
Site (HASS) Version 4.5 will address the top 10 customer complaints across the uni￾versity without any negative impact on average performance, reliability or response 
time across the system.”6
There appear to be four essential qualities of an effective vision (see Figure 11.4). 
First, its essential qualities must be able to be communicated. A vision is worthless 
if it only resides in someone’s head. The use of concrete, image-based language, 
such as “pocket rocket,” is critical (Murphy & Clark, 2016). Second, visions have to 
be not only challenging but also realistic. For example, a task force directed at over￾hauling the curriculum at the college of business at a state university is likely to roll 
its collective eyes if the dean announces that their vision is to compete against the 
Harvard Business School. Conversely, developing the best undergraduate business 
program in that state may be a realistic vision for that task force. Third, the project 
manager has to believe in the vision. Passion for the vision is an essential element of 
an effective vision. Finally, it should be a source of inspiration to others. Just like not 
all projects require strong leadership, not all projects need a “vision” to be success￾fully managed. These would include plan driven, do it by the numbers projects like 
assembling a production line or building a bridge. Likewise, visions are less likely to 
be important when the project objectives are a clear source of inspiration like rescue 
efforts or solving a crucial problem.
Once a project manager accepts the importance of building a shared vision, the next 
question is how to get a vision for a particular project. First, project managers don’t get 
visions. They act as catalysts and midwives for the formation of a shared vision of a

Once upon a time, back in 1976, Data 
General (DG) Corporation needed to 
come up quickly with a fast, reason￾ably priced, 32-bit mini-computer to 
compete with Digital Equipment Cor￾poration’s VAX. Data General CEO Edson de Castro 
launched the Fountainhead project and gave it the best 
people and ample resources to complete the 32-bit 
initiative. As a backup to the Fountainhead project, 
DG created the Eagle project within the Eclipse group 
under the leadership of Tom West. Work on both proj￾ects began in 1978.
In 1980 Data General announced its new computer, 
featuring simplicity, power, and low cost. This computer 
was not the Fountainhead from the well-funded “best” 
DG group but the Eagle from Tom West’s underfunded 
Eclipse team. Tracy Kidder saw all this happen and told 
the story in The Soul of a New Machine, which won a 
Pulitzer Prize in 1982. This book, which Kidder thought 
might be of interest to a handful of computer scientists, 
has become a project management classic.
In the beginning of his book, Kidder introduces 
the book’s protagonist, Tom West, by telling the story 
of him sailing a yacht across rough seas off the coast 
of New England. Kidder’s title for the prologue was “A 
Good Man in a Storm.”
Twenty years after Kidder’s book was published, 
Tom West was interviewed by Lawrence Peters for the 
Academy of Management Executive. The following are 
some excerpts that capture West’s views on managing 
innovative projects.
On selecting team members:
You explain to a guy what the challenge was, and 
then see if his eyes light up.
On motivating team members:
Challenge was everything. People, especially creative 
technical people who really want to make a differ￾ence, will do whatever is possible or whatever is 
necessary. I’ve done this more than once, and I’ve 
repeated it over and over. It seems to work.
On the importance of having a vision:
You’ve got to find a rallying cry. You need to have 
something that can be described very simply and has 
that sort of ring of truth to an engineer that says “yes 
that’s the thing to be doing right now.” Otherwise 
you’re going to be rolling rocks up hill all the time.
On the role of being a project manager:
You have to act as a cheerleader. You have to act as 
the instructor. You have to constantly bring to mind 
what the purpose is and what’s moving the ball 
towards the goal post, and what’s running sideways, 
and you have to take up a lot of battles for them. I 
mean you really don’t want your design engineer 
arguing with the guy in the drafting shop about why 
he ought to do it the designer’s way. I can do that, 
and I can pull rank too, and sometimes I did just that.

project team (Smith, 1994). In many cases, visions are inherent in the scope and objec￾tives of the project. People get naturally excited about being the first ones to bring a 
new technology to the market or solving a problem that is threatening their organiza￾tion. Even with mundane projects, there are often ample opportunities for establishing 
a compelling vision. One way is to talk to various people involved in the project and 
find out early on what gets them excited about the project. For some, it may be doing a 
better job than on the last project or the satisfaction in the eyes of the customers when 
the project is over. Many visions evolve reactively in response to competition—for 
example, Google engineers trying to develop a next-generation smartphone that critics 
will proclaim superior to the iPhone.
Some experts advocate engaging in formal vision-building meetings. These meet￾ings generally involve several steps, beginning with members identifying different 
aspects of the project and generating ideal scenarios for each aspect. For example, 
on a construction project, the scenarios may include “no accidents,” “no lawsuits,” 
“winning a prize,” or “how we are going to spend our bonus for completing the 
project ahead of schedule.” The group reviews and chooses the scenarios that are 
most appealing and translates them into vision statements for the project. The next 
step is to identify strategies for achieving the vision statements. For example, if 
one of the vision statements is that there will be no lawsuits, members will identify 
how they will have to work with the owner and subcontractors to avoid litigation. 
Next, members volunteer to be responsible for each statement. The vision, strate￾gies, and name of the responsible team member are published and distributed to 
relevant stakeholders.
In more cases than not, shared visions emerge informally. Project managers col￾lect information about what excites participants about the project. They test bits of 
their working vision in their conversations with team members to gauge the level 
of excitement the early ideas elicit in others. To some extent, they engage in basic 
market research. They seize opportunities to galvanize the team, such as a dispar￾aging remark by an executive that the project will never get done on time or the 
threat of a competing firm launching a similar project. Consensus in the beginning 
is not essential. What is essential is a core group of at least one-third of the project 
team that is genuinely committed to the vision. They will provide the critical mass 
to draw others aboard. Once the language has been formulated to communicate 
the vision, the statement needs to be a staple part of every working agenda, and 
the project manager should be prepared to deliver a “stump” speech at a moment’s 
notice. When problems or disagreements emerge, all responses should be consis￾tent with the vision.
Much has been written about visions and leadership. Critics argue that vision is 
a glorified substitute for shared goals. Others argue that it is one of the things that 
separate leaders from managers. The key is discovering what excites people about 
a project, being able to articulate this source of excitement in an appealing manner, 
and protecting and nurturing this source of excitement throughout the project.
Managing Project Reward Systems
Project managers are responsible for managing the reward system that encourages 
team performance and extra effort. One advantage they have is that often project 
work is inherently satisfying, whether it is manifested in an inspiring vision or a 
simple sense of accomplishment. Projects provide participants with a change in 
scenery, a chance to learn new skills, and an opportunity to break out of their 
departmental cocoon. Another inherent reward is what has been referred to as 
Final PDF to printer418 Chapter 11 Managing Project Teams
lar60886_ch11_401-444.indd 418 10/14/23 10:14 am
“pinball”—project success typically gives team members an option to play another 
exciting game.
7
Still, many projects are underappreciated and boring; interfere with other, more 
significant priorities; and are considered an extra burden. In some of these cases, the 
biggest reward is finishing the project so that team members can go back to what 
they really enjoy doing and what will yield the biggest personal payoffs. Unfortu￾nately, when this attitude is the primary incentive, project quality is likely to suffer. 
In these circumstances, external rewards play a more important role in motivating 
team performance.
Most project managers we talk to advocate the use of group rewards. Because 
most project work is a collaborative effort, it only makes sense that the reward sys￾tem would encourage teamwork. Recognizing individual members regardless of 
their accomplishments can distract from team unity. Project work is highly interde￾pendent, so it can become problematic to distinguish who truly deserves additional 
credit. Cash bonuses and incentives need to be linked to project priorities. It makes 
no sense to reward a team for completing their work early if controlling cost was the 
number one priority.
One of the limitations of lump-sum cash bonuses is that all too often they are con￾sumed by the household budget to pay the dentist or mechanic. To have more value, 
rewards need to have lasting significance (Smith & Reinertsen, 1997). Many compa￾nies convert cash into vacation rewards, sometimes with corresponding time off. For 
example, one firm rewarded a project team for getting the job done ahead of schedule 
with a four-day, all-expenses-paid trip to Walt Disney World for the members’ entire 
families. That vacation not only will be remembered for years but also recognizes 
spouses and children, who, in a sense, also contributed to the project’s success. Simi￾larly, other firms have been known to give members home computers and entertain￾ment centers. Wise project managers negotiate a discretionary budget so that they can 
reward teams’ surpassing milestones with gift certificates to popular restaurants or 
tickets to sporting events. Impromptu pizza parties and barbecues are also used to cel￾ebrate key accomplishments.
Sometimes project managers have to use negative reinforcement to motivate project 
performance. For example, Ritti and Levy recount the story of one project manager 
who was in charge of the construction of a new, state-of-the-art manufacturing plant. 
His project team was working with a number of different contracting firms. The proj￾ect was slipping behind schedule, mostly because of a lack of cooperation among the 
different players. The project manager did not have direct authority over many key 
people, especially the contractors from the other companies. He did, however, have 
the freedom to convene meetings at his convenience. So the project manager instituted 
daily “coordination meetings,” which were required of all the principals involved, at 
6:00 a.m. The meetings continued for about two weeks until the project got back on 
schedule. At that time, the project manager announced that the next meeting was can￾celed, and no further sunrise meetings were ever scheduled.8
While project managers tend to focus on group rewards, there are times when they 
need to reward individual performance. This is done not only to compensate extraor￾dinary effort but also to signal to the others what exemplary behavior is. Examples of 
this kind of reward include

∙ Letters of commendation. While project managers may not have responsibility for 
their team members’ performance appraisals, they can write letters commending 
their project performance. These letters can be sent to the workers’ supervisors to 
be placed in their personnel files.
∙ Public recognition for outstanding work. Superlative workers should be pub￾licly recognized for their efforts. Some project managers begin each status 
review meeting with a brief mention of project workers who have exceeded their 
project goals.
∙ Job assignments. Good project managers recognize that while they may not have 
much budgetary authority, they do have substantial control over who does what, 
with whom, when, and where. Good work should be rewarded with desirable job 
assignments. Managers should be aware of member preferences and, when appro￾priate, accommodate them.
∙ Flexibility. Being willing to make exceptions to rules, if done judiciously, can be a 
powerful reward. Allowing members to work at home when a child is sick or excus￾ing a minor indiscretion can engender long-lasting loyalty.
Individual rewards should be used judiciously, and under extraordinary circum￾stances. Nothing undermines the cohesiveness of a team more than members beginning 
to feel that others are getting special treatment or that they are being treated unfairly. 
Camaraderie and collaboration can quickly vanish, only to be replaced by bickering 
and obsessive preoccupation with group politics. Such distractions can absorb energy 
that otherwise would be directed toward completing the project. Individual rewards 
typically should be used only when everyone in the team recognizes that a member is 
deserving of special recognition.
Orchestrating the Decision-Making Process
Most decisions on a project do not require a formal meeting to discuss alternatives 
and determine solutions. Instead, decisions are made in real time as part of the daily 
interactions among project managers, stakeholders, and team members. For example, 
as a result of a routine “How’s it going?” question, a project manager discovers that a 
mechanical engineer is stuck trying to meet the performance criteria for a prototype 
she is responsible for building. The project manager and engineer go down the hallway 
to talk to the designers, explain the problem, and ask what, if anything, can be done. 
The designers distinguish which criteria are essential and which ones they think can 
be compromised. The project manager then checks with the marketing group to make 
sure the modifications are acceptable. They agree with all but two of the modifica￾tions. The project manager goes back to the mechanical engineer and asks whether the 
proposed changes would help solve the problem. The engineer agrees. Before autho￾rizing the changes he calls the project sponsor, reviews the events, and gets the sponsor 
to sign off on the changes. This is an example of how, by practicing MBWA (manage￾ment by wandering around), project managers consult team members, solicit ideas, 
determine optimum solutions, and create a sense of involvement that builds trust and 
commitment to decisions.
Still, projects encounter problems and decisions that require the collective wisdom 
of team members, as well as relevant stakeholders. Group decision making should be 
used when it will improve the quality of important decisions (Vroom & Jago, 1988). 
This is often the case with complex problems that require the input of various spe￾cialists. Group decision making should also be used when strong commitment to the 
decision is needed and there is a low probability of acceptance if only one person

lar60886_ch11_401-444.indd 420 10/14/23 10:14 am
makes the decision. Participation is used to reduce resistance and secure support for 
the decision. Guidelines for managing group decision making are provided in the fol￾lowing section.
Facilitating Group Decision Making Project managers play a pivotal role in guid￾ing the group decision-making process. They must remind themselves that their job is 
not to make a decision but to facilitate the discussion within the group so that the team 
reaches a consensus on the best possible solution. Consensus within this context does 
not mean that everyone supports the decision 100 percent but that they all agree what 
the best solution is under the circumstances. Facilitating group decision making essen￾tially involves four major steps.
9
1. Identifying problems. The project manager needs to be careful not to state the 
problem in terms of choices (e.g., “Should we do X or Y?”). Rather, the project 
manager should identify the underlying problem to which these alternatives and 
probably others are potential solutions. This allows group members to generate 
alternatives, not just choose among them. One useful way of defining problems is to 
consider the gap between where a project is (the present state) and where it should 
be (desired state). For example, the project may be four days behind schedule or 
the prototype weighs two pounds more than the specifications. Whether the gap 
is small or large, the purpose is to eliminate it. The group must find one or more 
courses of action that will change the existing state into the desired one.
If defensive posturing is detected during the problem-identification discus￾sion, then it may be wise to postpone the problem-solving step if possible. This 
allows for emotions to subside and members to gain a fresh perspective on the 
issues involved.
2. Generating alternatives. Once there is general agreement on the nature of the 
problem(s), the next step is to generate alternative solutions. If the problem requires 
creativity, then brainstorming is commonly recommended. Here, the team gener￾ates a list of possible solutions on a flipchart or blackboard. During that time, the 
project manager establishes a moratorium on criticizing or evaluating ideas. Mem￾bers are encouraged to “piggyback” on others’ ideas by extending them or combin￾ing ideas into a new idea. The object is to create as many alternatives as possible, 
no matter how outlandish they appear to be. Some project managers report that for 
really tough problems they have found it beneficial to conduct such sessions away 
from the normal work environment; the change in scenery stimulates creativity.
3. Reaching a decision. The next step is to evaluate the merits of alternative solu￾tions. During this phase, it is useful to have a set of criteria for this process. In many 
cases, the project manager can draw upon the priorities for the project and have the 
group assess each alternative in terms of its impact on cost, schedule, and perfor￾mance as well as reducing the problem gap. For example, if time is critical, then the 
solution that solves the problem as quickly as possible would be chosen.
During the course of the discussion, the project manager attempts to build con￾sensus among the group. This can be a complicated process. Project managers need 
to provide periodic summaries to help the group keep track of its progress. They 
must protect those members who represent the minority view and ensure that such 
views get a fair hearing. They need to guarantee that everyone has an opportunity to 
share opinions and no one individual or group dominates the conversation. It may 
9 This discussion is based on the classic work of Maier, N. R. F.: Problem-Solving Discussion and Conferences (New York: 
McGraw-Hill, 1963) and Problem Solving and Creativity in Individuals and Groups (Belmont, CA: Brooks-Cole, 1970).

be useful to regulate the use of air time with a two-minute timer. When conflicts 
occur, managers need to apply some of the ideas and techniques discussed in the 
next section.
Project managers need to engage in consensus testing to determine what points 
the group agrees on and what are still sources of contention. They are careful not to 
interpret silence as agreement; they confirm agreement by asking questions. Ulti￾mately, through thoughtful interaction, the team reaches a “meeting of the minds” 
as to what solution is best for the project.
4. Following up. Once the decision has been made and implemented, it is important 
for the team to find the time to evaluate the effectiveness of the decision. If the deci￾sion failed to provide the anticipated solution, then the reasons should be explored 
and the lessons learned added to the collective memory bank of the project team.
Managing Conflict within the Project
Disagreements and conflicts naturally emerge within a project team during the life of 
the project. Participants will disagree over priorities, the allocation of resources, the 
quality of specific work, solutions to discovered problems, and so forth (see Snap￾shot from Practice 11.4: Managing Low-Priority Projects). Some conflicts support the 
goals of the group and improve project performance. For example, two members may 
be locked in a debate over a design trade-off decision involving different features of 
a product. They argue that their preferred feature is what the primary customer truly 
wants. This disagreement may force them to get more information from the customer, 
with the result that they realize neither feature is highly valued and the customer wants 
something else instead. On the other hand, conflicts can also hinder group perfor￾mance. Initial disagreements can escalate into heated arguments with both parties 
refusing to work together.
Sources of conflict are likely to change as projects progress along the project life 
cycle (Adams & Brandt, 1988; Posner, 1986; Thamhain & Wilemon, 1975). Figure 11.5 
summarizes the major sources of conflict in each phase.
During project definition, the most significant sources of conflict are priorities, 
administrative procedures, and schedule. Disputes occur over the relative importance 
of the project compared with other activities, which project management structure to 
use (especially how much control the project manager should have), the personnel to 
be assigned, and the scheduling of the project into existing workloads.

During the planning phase, the chief source of conflict remains priorities, followed 
by schedules, procedures, and technical requirements. This is the phase when the proj￾ect moves from a general concept to a detailed set of plans. The relative importance 
of the project still must be established, as well as project priorities (time, cost, scope). 
Disagreements often emerge over the final schedule, the assignment of resources, 
communication and decision-making procedures, and the technical requirements for 
the project.
During the execution phase, friction arises over schedule slippage, technical prob￾lems, and staff issues. Milestones become more difficult to meet because of accu￾mulating schedule slippages. This leads to tension within the team as delays prevent 
others from starting or completing their work. Managing the trade-offs among time, 
cost, and performance becomes paramount. Project managers must decide among let￾ting the schedule slip, investing additional funds to get back on track, and scaling back 
the scope of the project in order to save time. Technical problems involve finding 
So far the discussion of team build￾ing has been directed primarily to 
significant projects that command 
the attention of assigned members. 
But what about projects that have low 
priority for team members: the perfunctory task forces 
that members begrudgingly join? The committee work 
people get assigned to do? The part-time projects that 
pull members away from the critical work they would 
rather be doing? The projects that cause members to 
privately question why they are doing this.
There is no magic wand available that transforms 
mildly interested, part-time project teams into high￾performance teams. We interviewed several project 
managers about such project scenarios. They all 
agreed that these can be very difficult and frustrating 
assignments and that there are limits to what is pos￾sible. Still, they offered tips and advice for making the 
best of the situation. Most of these tips focused on 
building commitment to the project when it does not 
naturally exist.
One project manager advocated orchestrating a 
large “time” investment up front on such projects—in 
the form of either a lengthy meeting or a significant 
early assignment. He viewed this as a form of down 
payment that members would forfeit if they didn’t carry 
the project to completion.
Others emphasized interjecting as much fun into 
activities as possible. Here rituals for building team 
identity come into play. People become committed 
because they enjoy working together on the project. 
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 11.4 Managing Low-Priority Projects
One project manager even confided that the perfect 
attendance at her project meetings was due primarily 
to the quality of the doughnuts she provided.
Another strategy is to make the benefits of the 
project as real to the team members as possible. One 
project manager escalated commitment to a mandated 
accidents prevention task force by bringing accident 
victims to a project meeting. Another project manager 
brought the high-ranking project sponsor to recharge 
the team by reinforcing the importance of the project 
to the company.
Most of the project managers emphasized the 
importance of building a strong personal relationship 
with each of the team members. When this connection 
occurs, members work hard not so much because they 
really care about the project but because they don’t 
want to let the project manager down. Although not 
couched in influence currency terms, these managers 
talked about getting to know each member, sharing 
contacts, offering encouragement, and extending a 
helping hand when needed.
Finally, all the project managers cautioned that 
nothing should be taken for granted on low-priority 
projects. They recommended reminding people about 
meetings and bringing extra copies of materials to 
meetings for those who have forgotten them or can’t 
find them. Project managers should remain in frequent 
contact with team members and remind them of their 
assignments. One manager summed it up best when 
he said, “Sometimes it all boils down to just being a 
good nag.”

solutions to unexpected problems and integrating the contributions of various people. 
The strain of the project may be expressed in interpersonal conflicts as well as pres￾sures to use resources more effectively.
During the delivery phase, the level of conflict tends to subside. On troubled proj￾ects, schedules continue to be the biggest source of conflict as schedule slippages 
make it more difficult to meet target completion dates. Pressures to meet objectives 
coupled with growing anxiety over future assignments increase interpersonal tensions. 
Technical problems are rare, since most of them have been worked out during the 
earlier phases.
Encouraging Functional Conflict The demarcation between functional and 
dysfunctional conflict is neither clear nor precise. In one team, members may 
exchange a diatribe of four-letter expletives and eventually resolve their differences. 
Yet in another project team, such behavior would create irreconcilable divisions and 
would prohibit the parties from ever working together productively again. The dis￾tinguishing criterion is how the conflict affects project performance, not how indi￾viduals feel. Members can be upset and dissatisfied with the interchange, but as long 
as the disagreement furthers the objectives of the project, the conflict is functional. 
Project managers should recognize that conflict is an inevitable and even a desirable 
part of project work; the key is to encourage functional conflict and manage dysfunc￾tional conflict.
A shared vision can transcend the incongruities of a project and establish a com￾mon purpose to channel debate in a constructive manner. Without shared goals, there 
is no common ground for working out differences. In the previous example involv￾ing the design trade-off decision, when both parties agreed that the primary goal was 
to satisfy the customer, there was a basis for more objectively resolving the dispute. 
Therefore, agreeing in advance which priority is most important—cost, schedule, or 
scope—can help a project team decide what response is most appropriate.
Sometimes it’s not the presence of conflict but the absence of conflict that is the 
problem. Often as a result of compressed time pressures, self-doubt, and the desire 
to preserve team harmony, members are reluctant to voice objections. This hesitation 
robs the team of useful information that might lead to better solutions and the avoid￾ance of critical mistakes. Project managers need to encourage healthy dissent in order 
to improve problem solving and innovation. They can demonstrate this process by 
asking tough questions and challenging the rationale behind recommendations. They 
can also orchestrate healthy conflict by bringing people with different points of view 
to critical meetings.
Project managers can legitimize dissent within the team by designating someone to 
play the role of devil’s advocate or by asking the group to take 15 minutes to come up 
with all the reasons the team should not pursue a course of action. Functional conflict 
plays a critical role in obtaining a deeper understanding of the issues and coming up 
with the best decisions possible.
One of the most important things project managers can do is model an appropri￾ate response when someone disagrees or challenges their ideas. They need to avoid 
acting defensively and instead encourage critical debate. They should exhibit effec￾tive listening skills and summarize the key issues before responding. They should 
check to see if others agree with the opposing point of view. Finally, project man￾agers should value and protect dissenters. Organizations have a tendency to create 
too many yes-men, and the emperor needs to be told when he doesn’t have any 
clothes on.

Managing Dysfunctional Conflict Managing dysfunctional conflict is a much 
more challenging task than encouraging functional conflict. First, dysfunctional con￾flict is hard to identify. A manager might have two highly talented professionals who 
hate each other but in the heat of competition produce meritorious results. Is this a 
pleasant situation? No. Is it functional? Yes, as long as it contributes to project per￾formance. Conversely, sometimes functional conflict degenerates into dysfunctional 
conflict. This change occurs when technical disagreements evolve into irrational per￾sonality clashes or when failure to resolve an issue causes unnecessary delays in 
critical project work.
The second major difficulty managers face is that there is often no easy solution 
to dysfunctional conflict. Project managers have to choose from among a number of 
strategies to manage it; the following are five possibilities.
1. Mediate the conflict. The manager intervenes and tries to negotiate a resolution 
by using reasoning and persuasion, suggesting alternatives and the like. One of the 
keys is trying to find common ground. In some cases the project manager can make 
the argument that the win/lose interchange has escalated to the point that it has 
become lose/lose for everyone and now is the time to make concessions.
2. Arbitrate the conflict. The manager imposes a solution to the conflict after listen￾ing to each party. The goal is not to decide who wins but to have the project win. In 
doing so, it is important to seek a solution that allows each party to save face; other￾wise, the decision may provide only momentary relief. One project manager admits 
that she has had great success using a King Solomon approach to resolving conflict. 
She announces a solution that neither party will like and gives the opponents two 
hours to come up with a better solution they can both agree on.
3. Control the conflict. Reducing the intensity of the conflict by smoothing over dif￾ferences or interjecting humor is an effective strategy. If feelings are escalating, the 
manager can adjourn the interaction and hope cooler heads prevail the next day. If 
the conflict continues to escalate, project assignments may need to be rearranged if 
possible so that the two parties don’t have to work together.
4. Accept the conflict. In some cases the conflict will outlive the project and, though 
a distraction, it is one the manager has to live with.
5. Eliminate the conflict. Sometimes the conflict has escalated to the point that it 
is no longer tolerable. If there is a clear villain, then only that person should be 
removed. If, as is often the case, both parties are at fault, then it is wise, if possible, 
to eliminate both individuals. Their removal gives a clear signal to the others on the 
team that this kind of behavior is unacceptable.
In summary, project managers create the foundation for functional conflict by 
establishing clear roles and responsibilities, developing common goals or a shared 
vision, and using group incentives that reward collaboration. Project managers have 
to be adroit at reading body language to identify unspoken disagreement. They also 
have to keep in touch with what is going on in a project to identify small problems that 
might escalate into big conflicts. Using well-timed humor and redirecting the focus 
to what is best for the project can alleviate the interpersonal tensions that are likely to 
flare up on a project team.
Rejuvenating the Project Team
Over the course of a long project, a team sometimes drifts off track and loses momen￾tum. The project manager needs to swing into action to realign the team with the 
project objectives. There are both formal and informal ways of doing this. Informally, 
Final PDF to printerChapter 11 Managing Project Teams 425
lar60886_ch11_401-444.indd 425 10/14/23 10:14 am
the project manager can institute new rituals, like the “toy roaches,” to re-energize the 
team. On one project that was experiencing rough going, the project manager stopped 
work and took the team bowling to relieve frustrations. On another project, a manager 
showed the team the movie The Shawshank Redemption to rekindle hope and commit￾ment to success.
Another option is to have the project sponsor give a pep talk to the “troops.” In 
other cases, a friendly challenge can reinvigorate a team. For example, one project 
sponsor offered to cook a five-course meal if the project got back on track and hit the 
next milestone.
Sometimes more formal action needs to be taken. The project manager may recog￾nize the need for a team-building session devoted to improving the work processes of 
the team. This meeting is particularly appropriate if the project manager senses that 
the team is approaching a transition point in its development. The goal of such a ses￾sion is to improve the project team’s effectiveness through better management of proj￾ect demands and group processes. It is the team’s inward look at its own performance, 
behavior, and culture to eliminate dysfunctional behaviors and strengthen functional 
ones. The project team critiques its performance, analyzes its way of doing things, and 
attempts to develop strategies to improve its operation.
Often an external consultant is hired or an internal staff specialist is assigned to 
facilitate the session. This process brings a more objective, outside perspective to the 
table, frees the project manager to be part of the process, and provides a specialist 
trained in group dynamics. Furthermore, if preliminary information is to be collected, 
team members may be more candid with and open to an outsider.
One caveat about using outside consultants is that too often managers resort to this 
as a method for dealing with a problem that they have been unable or unwilling to deal 
with. The marching order to the consultant is “Fix my team for me.” What the manag￾ers fail to recognize is that one of the keys to fixing the team is improving the working 
relationship between themselves and the remainder of the team. For such sessions to 
be effective, project managers must be willing to have their own role scrutinized and 
be receptive to changing their own behavior and work habits based on the team’s com￾ments and suggestions.
Consultants use a wide variety of team-building techniques to elevate team perfor￾mance. Here is a brief description of one of the more common approaches. The first 
step is to gather information and make a preliminary diagnosis of team performance. 
Whether through individual interviews or in a group forum, the consultant asks gen￾eral questions about the project team performance, that is, what obstacles are getting in 
the way of the team being able to perform better? This information is summarized in 
terms of themes. When everyone has understood the themes, the group ranks them in 
terms of both their importance and the extent the team has ownership over them. This 
last dimension is critical. Ownership refers to whether the team has direct influence 
over the issue. For example, a team probably has little influence over the delivery of 
contracted supplies, but team members do control how quickly they inform each other 
of sudden changes in plans.
If the group becomes preoccupied with issues outside its control, the meeting can 
quickly evolve into a demoralizing gripe session. Therefore, the most important issues 
they have direct control over become the subjects of the agenda. During the meet￾ing, much interpersonal and group process information will be generated, and that is 
examined too. Thus, the group works on two sets of items: the agenda items and the 
items that emerge from the interaction of the participants. This is where the expertise 
of the external facilitator becomes critical for identifying interaction patterns and their 
implications for team performance.

As important problems are discussed, alternatives for action are developed. The 
team-building session concludes by deciding on specific action steps for remedying 
problems and setting target dates for who will do what, and when. These assignments 
can be reviewed at project status meetings or at a follow-up session.
It has become fashionable to link team-building activities with outdoor experiences. 
The outdoor experience—such as whitewater rafting down the Rogue River in Oregon 
or rock climbing in Colorado—places group members in a variety of physically chal￾lenging situations that must be mastered through teamwork, not individual effort. By 
having to work together to overcome difficult obstacles, team members are supposed 
to experience increased self-confidence, more respect for one another’s capabilities, 
and a greater commitment to teamwork. No empirical data are available to support 
such exotic endeavors other than the enthusiastic support of the participants. Such 
activities are likely to provide an intense common experience that may accelerate the 
social development of the team. Such an investment of time and money communicates 
the importance of teamwork and is considered by some a perk for being on the project. 
At the same time, unless the lessons from these experiences can be immediately trans￾ferred to actual project work, their significance is likely to vanish.
11.4 Managing Virtual Project Teams
The COVID-19 Pandemic forced people to work from home and changed the nature of 
work forever. A 2022 Gallup survey found that 8 out of 10 people are working at least 
part-time from home (Wigert & Agrawal, 2022). Houses and apartments are being reno￾vated to create a workspace around a home computer. Global industries have a history of 
advancing electronic forms of communication to link people across the globe on projects. 
This provided companies access to greater expertise and the ability to work 24/7 on proj￾ects (see Snapshot for Practice 11.5: Managing Virtual Global Teams).
One way to characterize this new “virtual” world in terms of projects is to consider 
four types of working conditions:
– The traditional project team where everybody comes to work each day and can 
interact in person.
– The virtual project team in which the team is spatially separated and relies pri￾marily on electronic forms of communication to interact with each other.
– Mixed project teams where most of the team are able to work together in person, 
but there are significant other members who can only communicate electronically 
with the team.
– Hybrid project teams where team members are centrally located. Team members 
spend part of their time at the “office” where they can interact with each other and 
part of their time working on projects at home. Some say this will be the new 
norm of work (Bloom, 2020).
Lessons learned from the creation of virtual project teams (aka virtual project) 
will be discussed first, and followed by their ramifications for managing mixed and 
hybrid teams.
Two of the biggest challenges involved in managing a virtual project team are establish￾ing trust and developing effective patterns of communication (Lipsinger & DeRosa, 2010). 
Trust is difficult to establish in a virtual work environment. Unlike working as a tra￾ditional team, where members can see whether someone has done what s/he says s/he

Carl A. Singer, a senior program 
manager at IBM Global Services, 
described how global time zones were 
used to complete a time-intensive 
project. The project required subject 
matter experts (SMEs) to document existing best 
practices in the maintenance domain and to port 
these into a knowledge management tool. The most 
proficient SMEs available were on opposite sides of 
the globe—Australia and Scotland. Review and con￾trol of the project were from the United States.
Management realized that just working harder 
and smarter was not going to meet the time and qual￾ity targets. For this project, they used the dimension 
of time to their benefit. Applying sound management 
principles as well as taking advantage of electronic 
communication systems, the team was able to create 
a virtual 24-hour workday for quick responses and 
accelerated reviews.
Each team consisted of veteran professionals 
familiar with the rigors of time-pressured consulting 
projects. A local point person was identified for each 
team, and mutually agreed-upon targets, terminol￾ogy, and processes were established.
An all-hands kick-off meeting was organized in 
which participants were able to socialize, under￾stand local and project-wide constraints, and final￾ize an agreed-upon plan. The meeting was held at 
a corporate hotel with dining accommodations. The 
facility was considered an “assisted living commu￾nity for IBM consultants.” This hastened recovery 
from jet lag and provided an interruption-free work 
environment.
Upon returning to their home bases, each team 
created the majority of their deliverables indepen￾dently with periodic three-way conference calls to 
maintain coordination. A project control book was 
established electronically so that all participants had 
access to the latest project documents.
The final phase of the project required intense 
interfacing and reviews between the teams. These 
reviews necessitated changes to deal with concerns, 
differences among subprojects, and other issues. It 
was here that the worldwide nature of the project 
was leveraged. Using a “dry cleaning approach” (in 
by 5 p.m. out by 9 a.m.), team members in Australia 
and Scotland were able to address issues generated 
during the U.S.-based external reviews and provide 
concrete responses by the beginning of the next 
business day. Conference calls at 6:00 a.m. (U.S. 
EST) were used to coordinate responses and resolve 
issues. Conference calls at the end of the U.S. work￾day were used to finalize issues and assignments. 
Figure 11.6 depicts the 24-hour clock used to align 
communication schedules.
Telephone conferencing was used instead of 
videoconferencing due to the setup lead time and 
because it would force participants to leave their 
offices. E-mail was used extensively for general 
communication. An electronic repository of project 
work was used to coordinate global involvement. 
In practice, a participant could draft a document 
and deposit it electronically, only to wake up the 
next day to find the document annotated with sug￾gested revisions. Likewise, one could start the day 
by checking an in-basket populated with documents 
to review and issues to address. Over time, “G’day” 
and “Cheers” crept into the U.S. speech—a clear 
indicator of team cohesion.
Singer identified a number of lessons learned 
from the project:
• The all-hands kick-off meeting was critical for estab￾lishing goals and procedures as well as “rules of 
courtesy.”
• Loosen the reins—establish clear deliverables and 
then step out of the way and let the professionals 
do their work.

has done, virtual team members depend on the word of distant members. At the same 
time, it can be difficult to trust someone you may have met only one or two times or 
not at all. Geographical separation also prohibits the informal social interactions that 
are often essential to building camaraderie among team members. As one virtual team 
member put it, “You can’t have a beer together over the Internet.”
So how can a project manager facilitate the development of trust within a virtual 
team? First, if it is impossible to hold a face-to-face meeting in the beginning, manag￾ers need to orchestrate the exchange of social information—who everyone is and some 
personal background information during the initial electronic interchange. Second, they 
• Establish and enforce agreed-upon quality stan￾dards and deliverable templates.
• Maintain a regular schedule of conference calls, 
even if only to say, “Hello, we have nothing to talk 
about today.” Conference calls should be guided by 
pre-established agendas, note-taking procedures, 
and reviews.

need to set clear roles for each team member. Ideally, specific tasks should be assigned 
to each member so that s/he can make an immediate contribution to the project. Third, 
project managers should have the team work on a mini-project so they can get used to 
working together. Trust in virtual projects grows through team member reliability, con￾sistency, and responsiveness (Coutu, 1998). Finally, if possible, teams should be seeded 
with people who have already worked effectively together on projects.
The second major challenge for managing a virtual project team is to establish 
effective patterns of communication. E-mail and faxes are great for communicating 
facts—but not the feelings behind the facts; nor do they allow for real-time communi￾cation. Conference calls and project chat rooms can help, but they also have their limi￾tations. Videoconferencing is a significant improvement over nonvisual electronic 
forms of communication. Still, videoconferencing is not always available or is of such 
poor quality to be a distraction in many parts of the world. The maxim is “Match tech￾nology to the communication need.” The following are some guidelines developed by 
3M for use on their distributed projects.
10
∙ When to e-mail. Use e-mail to distribute important information and news in a one￾to-one or one-to-many frame of reference.
∙ When to use electronic bulletin boards. Use electronic bulletin boards to encour￾age discussion and flush out the diversity of opinion on issues.
∙ When to videoconference. Videoconference when you need to see each other’s faces 
and expressions. This is important during the early phases of a project, when you are 
building relationships and developing a common understanding of what needs to be 
done. Use it, again, when working on critical decisions and/or contentious issues.
∙ When to use conference calls. Use conference calls when people in different loca￾tions are working with common documents, presentations, sketches, and models. In 
addition, use them for status report meetings and to sustain social camaraderie.
∙ When to fly/meet. Fly to build or repair trust. Use the travel budget to get all the 
key players together early on to instill commitment to the goals of the project and 
engage in team-building activities. Meet when the different talents and expertise of 
team members are needed to innovate and problem solve. More than one project 
manager has reported dissatisfaction with videoconferencing as a means to collec￾tively solving difficult problems.
Even with the best communication system, managers have to overcome the prob￾lems of working within time zone differences, working with cultural nuances, and 
finding a convenient time for people to conference.
Following are some additional tips for alleviating communication problems and 
enhancing the performance of working in virtual environments:
1. Don’t let team members vanish. Virtual teams often experience problems getting 
in touch with each other. Use Internet scheduling software to store members’ calen￾dars. Check in with team members on a regular basis.
2. Establish a code of conduct to avoid delays. Team members need to agree not 
only on what, when, and how the information will be shared but also on how and 
when they will respond to it. Develop a priority system to distinguish messages 
that require an immediate response from those with longer time frames. Recognize 
differences between how a person communicates via e-mail (written) versus face to 
face (verbal). Use the means most effective for that person and ask follow-up ques￾tions on inadequately written communiques.

3. Establish clear norms and protocols for surfacing assumptions and conflicts.
Because most communication is nonvisual, project managers cannot watch body 
language and facial expressions to develop a sense of what is going on. They need 
to probe deeper when communicating to force members to explain their viewpoints, 
actions, and concerns more clearly; they must double-check comprehension.
4. Use electronic video technology to verify work. Instead of relying on others’ 
judgment, have members “show” work that has been done via Internet video. This 
can avoid costly misunderstanding and provide useful feedback.
5. Share the pain. Do not require everyone to conform to your time zone and prefer￾ences. Rotate meeting times so that all team members have a turn working accord￾ing to their clock.
Mixed Project Teams
In many cases, a core group of a project team is centrally located while other key 
members live in separate locales. For example, a core group of coders work in Austin, 
Texas, while the testers live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and Fayetteville, Arkansas, 
while customer focus groups are being conducted in Athens, Georgia, Worcester, Mas￾sachusetts, and Provo, Utah. One of the biggest threats to mixed project team perfor￾mance is subgrouping, that instead of working together as one team, smaller groups 
form around their common location.
Mixed project teams are particularly susceptible to subgrouping, given that some 
members share a much richer interaction experience with their immediate colleagues 
than those more distal team members. Here it is important for project managers not let 
one group dominate discussions and they should go out of their way to solicit opinions 
from more isolated members. Often times, the isolated team member’s accomplish￾ments are invisible to others. It is vital for the project manager to draw attention to the 
contributions of less visible team members so that they feel a part of the team.
Hybrid Project Teams
Now that people experienced the benefits of working at home (fewer disruptions, 
flexible daily schedule, no commute, etc.), there will be greater demands on accom￾modating home/work project schedules. This is in part due to greater reliance on 
electronic forms of business communication and that one can replicate the office 
workstation at home.
It is only natural for many to wish to do as much work at home as possible, espe￾cially those with challenging commutes. This personal preference should not take 
precedent over the requirements of the work being performed and the need to work 
directly with others. The project managers need to oversee communication patterns 
within the team and make sure people are interacting face to face when needed. They 
should be on the look-out for team members avoiding direct contact with people who 
disagree with them or have had unpleasant exchanges in the past. It is only natural to 
avoid unpleasant encounters and try to rely on e-mail to solve problems.
Not all people respond the same to working at home on projects. Here the 
introvert/extrovert personality dimension is likely to be a key factor. Extroverts
tend to be talkative, outgoing, and enjoy social interaction. Introverts, on the other 
hand, are more reserved and like alone time to engage in more reflective thinking. 
Introverts and extroverts seek energy in different ways. Introverts require fewer 
stimuli and social interaction while extroverts enjoy more stimulation and become 
more energized in social settings. This is not an either–or question. People will vary 
Final PDF to printerChapter 11 Managing Project Teams 431
lar60886_ch11_401-444.indd 431 10/14/23 10:14 am
on the introvert/extrovert spectrum. Introverts are likely to prefer and excel at work￾ing at home while extroverts may struggle with a lack of social interaction. Strong 
extroverts’ performance actually may improve by spending less time at home than 
at work office.
To some extent managing a virtual, mixed, or hybrid project team is no different 
from managing a regular project team. The key is working within the constraints of 
the situation to develop effective ways for team members to interact and combine their 
talents to complete the project.
11.5 Project Team Pitfalls
High-performance project teams can produce dramatic results. However, like any 
good thing, there is a dark side to project teams that managers need to be aware of. In 
this section, we examine some of the pathologies that high-performance project teams 
can succumb to and highlight what project managers can do to reduce the likelihood 
of these problems occurring.
Groupthink
Janis (1982) first identified groupthink as a factor that influenced the misguided 
1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. His term refers to the tendency of members in 
highly cohesive groups to lose their critical evaluative capabilities. This malady 
appears when pressures for conformity are combined with an illusion of invinci￾bility to suspend critical discussion of decisions. As a result, decisions are made 
quickly with little consideration of alternatives; often the practice leads to fiascoes 
that, after the fact, appear totally improbable. Some of the symptoms of groupthink 
include the following:
∙ Illusion of invulnerability. The team feels invincible. It is marked by a high 
degree of esprit de corps, an implicit faith in its own wisdom, and an inordinate 
optimism that allows group members to feel complacent about the quality of 
their decisions.
∙ Whitewash of critical thinking. The group members discuss only a few solutions, 
ignoring alternatives; they fail to examine the adverse consequences that could fol￾low their preferred course of action; and they too quickly dismiss any alternatives 
that, on the surface, appear to be unsatisfactory.
∙ Negative stereotypes of outsiders. “Good guy/bad guy” stereotypes emerge in 
which the group considers any outsiders who oppose their decisions as the “bad 
guys,” who are perceived as incompetent and malicious and whose points are 
unworthy of serious consideration.
∙ Direct pressure. When a team member does speak out or question the direction in 
which the team is headed, direct pressure is applied to the dissenter. The individual 
is reminded that speed is important and that the aim is agreement, not argument.
Bureaucratic Bypass Syndrome
Project teams are often licensed to get things done without having to go through 
the normal protocols of the parent organization. Bypassing bureaucratic channels is 
appealing and invigorating. However, if bypassing becomes a way of life, it results in 
the rejection of bureaucratic policies and procedures, which provide the glue for the 
overall organization. A team that operates outside the organization may alienate other

GE Appliances, Marriott Corp., and 
Hewlett Packard are among the many 
firms that use the nominal group 
technique (NGT) to guide decisions 
on projects. The NGT begins by gath￾ering project team members and/or stakeholders 
around a table and identifying the project problem at 
hand. Each member then writes his or her solutions. 
Next, each member presents his or her solution to the 
group, and the leader writes these solutions on a chart. 
No criticism is allowed. This process continues until all 
the ideas have been expressed. Each solution then is 
discussed and clarified by the group. After all the ideas 
have been discussed, the group members privately 
rank-order their preferred solutions. The balloting is 
tallied to create a rank-ordering of each solution. These 
steps are repeated if necessary to refine the list further 
in order to get the most preferred solution.
NGT provides an orderly process for dealing with 
potentially inflammatory problems. It also prevents 
groupthink from occurring. NGT discourages any pres￾sure to conform to the wishes of a high-status, power￾ful group member, since all ideas are discussed and all 
preferences are expressed privately. Creativity should 
be enhanced, since members are able to offer a solu￾tion based on their expertise and viewpoint. Finally, 
important decisions can be made in a relatively timely 
manner. NGT works best when there is a well-defined 
problem.

workers, who are constrained by the norms and procedures of the organization; even￾tually, these outside bureaucrats will find ways to put up roadblocks and thwart the 
project team (Johansen et al., 1991).
Team Spirit Becomes Team Infatuation
High-performance project teams can be a tremendous source of personal satisfaction. 
The excitement, chaos, and joy generated by working on a challenging project can be 
an invigorating experience. Leavitt and Lipman-Blumen (1995) even go so far as to 
say that team members behave like people in love. They become infatuated with the 
challenge of the project and the talent around them. This total preoccupation with the 
project and the project team, while contributing greatly to the remarkable success of 
the project, can leave in its wake a string of broken professional and personal relation￾ships that contribute to burnout and disorientation upon completion of the project.
Going Local
Going local is a phrase used to describe employees who assume the customs, values, 
and prerogatives of their foreign country assignment.
11 They no longer represent the 
interests of the company that sent them but rather those of the local people, culture, 
or government.
This phenomenon can occur in project teams working abroad or in those who 
become closely identified with their customers. In essence, the customer’s interests 
take precedence over the parent organization’s interests. This change in viewpoint can 
lead to excessive scope creep and open defiance of corporate policy and interests.
Dealing with going local and other maladies is problematic because, in most cases, 
they are a distortion of a good thing, rather than a simple evil.
11 Movie examples of this include Avatar (2010), The Sleeping Dictionary (2003), and Lawrence of Arabia (1962).

Summary Project managers often work under less-than-ideal conditions to develop a cohesive 
team committed to working together and completing the project to the best of their 
abilities. They have to recruit personnel from other departments and manage the tem￾porary involvement of team members. They often have to bring strangers together and 
quickly establish a set of operational procedures that unite their efforts and contribu￾tions. They have to be skilled at managing meetings so that they do not become a bur￾den but, rather, a vehicle for progress. Project managers need to forge a team identity 
and a shared vision that command the attention and allegiance of participants. They 
often have to manage team members they have little or no direct contact with. Project 
managers have to encourage functional conflict that contributes to superior solutions 
while being on guard against dysfunctional conflict that can break a team apart. In 
doing these things, they have to avoid the pitfalls of excessive group cohesion.
While agendas, charters, visions, rewards, and so forth are important tools and 
techniques, it was emphasized both in this chapter and in Chapter 10 that the most 
important tool a project manager has to build an effective project team is his or her 
own behavior. Just as the founding members of an organization shape the culture of 
the organization, the project manager shapes and influences the internal culture of the 
project team. A positive example can define how team members respond to changes, 
how they handle new tasks, and how they relate to one another and the rest of the 
organization. There is no easy way to lead by example. It requires personal conviction, 
discipline, sensitivity to team dynamics, and a constant awareness of how personal 
actions are perceived by others.

Awareness is the first step in prevention. The next step is to take preemptive action 
to reduce the likelihood of these pitfalls occurring. For example, managers can reduce 
the isolation of the project team by creating work-related connections outside the proj￾ect team. These interactions naturally occur in a matrix environment where members 
work on multiple projects and maintain ties to their home department. Likewise, the 
isolation of dedicated project teams can be reduced by the timely involvement of exter￾nal specialists.
In either case, the active involvement of relevant members of the parent organiza￾tion at project status meetings can help maintain the link between the project and the 
rest of the organization. If the team appears to be suffering from groupthink, then the 
project manager can encourage functional conflict by playing a devil’s advocate role 
to encourage dissent or using a structured problem-solving approach like the nomi￾nal group technique (see Snapshot from Practice 11.6: Nominal Group Technique). 
Finally, formal team-building sessions may reveal dysfunctional norms and refocus 
the team’s attention on project objectives.

group try to overcome the negative factors? What could you have done dif￾ferently to overcome these negative factors?
c. Analyze how effectively the group managed meetings. What did the group do well? 
What didn’t the group do well? If the group were formed again, what specific rec￾ommendations would you make about how the group should manage meetings?
2. Assume that you have the following decision-making options: (1) make decisions 
on your own with available information, (2) consult others before making a deci￾sion, and (3) call a meeting and reach a consensus, seeking to arrive at a final deci￾sion everyone can agree on. Which approach would you use to make each of the 
following decisions and why?
a. You were the project leader for Casino Night on campus, a charitable event orga￾nized by your group to raise money for the homeless. The event was a big suc￾cess, garnering a net profit of $8,500. Before the event, your team researched 
nearby organizations that support the homeless and to whom the money could be 
given. You narrowed the choices to the Chunk of Coal House and St. Mary’s 
Soup Kitchen. Eventually, your group decided that the funds should be given to 
Chunk of Coal House. You are about to write a check to its director when you 
read in the local newspaper that the Chunk of Coal House has terminated opera￾tions. What should you do with the money?
b. You are a golf course designer hired by Trysting Tree Golf Club to renovate their 
golf course. You have worked closely with the board of directors of the club to 
develop a new layout that is both challenging and aesthetically pleasing. Every￾one is excited about the changes. The project is nearly 75 percent complete when 
you encounter problems on the 13th hole. The 13th hole at Trysting Tree is a 
125-yard par three in which golfers have to hit their tee shots over a lake to a 
modulated green. During the construction of the new tee box, workers discov￾ered that an underground spring runs beneath the box to the lake. You inspected 
the site and agreed with the construction supervisor that this could create serious 
problems, especially during the rainy winter months. After surveying the area, 
you believe the only viable option would be to extend the hole to 170 yards and 
create elevated tees on the adjacent hillside. Which of the three decision-making 
options should you use to make a decision about Hole 13?
c. You are the leader of a new-product development project. Your team has 
worked hard on developing a third-generation product that incorporates new 
technology and meets customer demands. The project is roughly 50 percent 
complete. You have just received a report from the Marketing Department 
detailing a similar product that is about to be released by a competitor. The 
product appears to utilize radical new design principles that expand the func￾tionality of the product. This poses a serious threat to the success of your proj￾ect. Top management is considering canceling your project and starting over 
again. They want you to make a recommendation.
3. The following activities are based on a current or recently completed group proj￾ect that you are (were) involved in. This project may be a student project, a work 
project, or an extracurricular project.
a. How strong is the team identity on this project and why?
b. What could participants do to strengthen team identity?
c. What kind of informal activities could be used to rejuvenate the team? Why 
would these activities work?

Case 11.1
Kerzner Office Equipment
Amber Briggs looked nervously at her watch as she sat at the front of a large table in 
the cafeteria at Kerzner Office Equipment. It was now 10 minutes after 3:00 and only 
10 of the 14 members had arrived for the first meeting of the Kerzner anniversary task 
force. Just then two more members hurriedly sat down and mumbled apologies for 
being late. Briggs cleared her throat and started the meeting.
KERZNER OFFICE EQUIPMENT
Kerzner Office Equipment is located in Charleston, South Carolina. It specializes in 
the manufacture and sales of high-end office furniture and equipment. Kerzner enjoyed 
steady growth during its first five years of existence with a high-water employment 
mark of more than 1,400 workers. Then a national recession struck, forcing Kerzner 
to lay off 25 percent of its employees. This was a traumatic period for the company. 
Justin Tubbs was brought in as the new CEO, and things began to slowly turn around. 
Tubbs was committed to employee participation and redesigned operations around 
the concept of self-managing teams. The company soon introduced an innovative line 
of ergonomic furniture designed to reduce back strain and carpal tunnel. This line 
of equipment proved to be a resounding success, and Kerzner became known as a 
leader in the industry. The company currently employs 1,100 workers and has just 
been selected for the second straight time by the Charleston Post and Courier as one 
of the 10 best local firms to work for in South Carolina.
AMBER BRIGGS
Amber Briggs is a 42-year-old human resource specialist who has worked for Ker￾zner for the past five years. During this time, she has performed a variety of activi￾ties involving recruitment, training, compensation, and team building. David Brown, 
vice president of human resources, assigned Briggs the responsibility for organizing 
Kerzner’s 10th-anniversary celebration. She was excited about the project because she 
would report directly to top management.
CEO Tubbs briefed her as to the purpose and objectives of the celebration. Tubbs 
stressed that this should be a memorable event and that it was important to celebrate 
Kerzner’s success since the dark days of the layoffs. Moreover, he confided that he had 
just read a book on corporate cultures and believed that such events were important for 
conveying the values at Kerzner. He went on to say that he wanted this to be an employee 
celebration—not a celebration conjured up by top management. As such, she would be 
assigned a task force of 14 employees from each of the major departments to organize 
and plan the event. Her team was to present a preliminary plan and budget for the event 
to top management within three months. When discussing budgets, Tubbs revealed that 
he felt the total cost should be somewhere in the $250,000 range. He concluded the 
meeting by offering to help Briggs in any way he could to make the event a success.
Soon thereafter Briggs received the list of the names of the task force members, and she 
contacted them by either phone or e-mail to arrange today’s meeting. She had to scramble 
to find a meeting place. Her cubicle in Human Resources was too small to accommodate 
such a group, and all the meeting rooms at Kerzner were booked or being refurbished. 
She settled on the cafeteria because it was usually deserted in the late afternoon. Prior to 
Final PDF to printerChapter 11 Managing Project Teams 439
lar60886_ch11_401-444.indd 439 10/14/23 10:14 am
the meeting, she posted the agenda on a flipchart (see Figure C11.1) adjacent to the table. 
Given everyone’s busy schedules, the meeting was limited to just one hour.
THE FIRST MEETING
Briggs began the meeting by saying, “Greetings. For those who don’t know me, I’m 
Amber Briggs from Human Resources and I’ve been assigned to manage the 10th￾anniversary celebration at Kerzner. Top management wants this to be a special event—
at the same time, they want it to be our event. This is why you are here. Each of you 
represents one of the major departments, and together our job is to plan and organize 
the celebration.” She then reviewed the agenda and asked each member to introduce 
him/herself. The tall, red-haired woman to the right of Briggs broke the momentary 
silence by saying, “Hi, I’m Cara Miller from Plastics. I guess my boss picked me for 
this task force because I have a reputation for throwing great parties.”
In turn, each member followed suit. Following is a sampling of their introductions:
“Hi, I’m Mike Wales from Maintenance. I’m not sure why I’m here. Things have 
been a little slow in our department, so my boss told me to come to this meeting.”
“I’m Megan Plinski from Domestic Sales. I actually volunteered for this assign￾ment. I think it will be a lot of fun to plan a big party.”
“Yo, my name is Nick Psias from Accounting. My boss said one of us had to join 
this task force, and I guess it was my turn.”
“Hi, I’m Rick Fennah. I’m the only one from Purchasing who has been here since 
the beginning. We’ve been through some rough times, and I think it is important to 
take time and celebrate what we’ve accomplished.”
“Hi, I’m Ingrid Hedstrom from International Sales. I think this is a great idea, but 
I should warn you that I will be out of the country for most of the next month.”
“I’m Abby Bell from Engineering. Sorry for being late, but things are a bit crazy 
in my department.”
Briggs circled the names of the two people who were absent and circulated a roster 
so that everyone could check to see if his or her phone number and e-mail address 
were correct. She then summarized her meeting with Tubbs and told the group that 
he expected them to make a formal presentation to top management within 10 weeks. 
She acknowledged that they were all busy people and that it was her job to manage the 
project as efficiently as possible. At the same time, she reiterated the importance of 
the project and that this would be a very public event: “If we screw up, everyone will 
know about it.”
Briggs went over the ground rules and emphasized that from now on meetings 
would start on time and that she expected to be notified in advance if someone was 
going to be absent. She summarized the first part of the project as centering on five 
key questions: when, where, what, who, and how much. She created a stir in the group 
when she responded to a question about cost by informing them that top management 
was willing to pay up to $250,000 for the event. Megan quipped, “This is going to be 
one hell of a party.”
Briggs then turned the group’s attention to identifying a common meeting time. 
After jousting for 15 minutes, she terminated the discussion by requesting that each 
member submit a schedule of free time over the next month by Friday. She would use 
this information and a new planning software to identify optimal times. She ended 
the meeting by thanking the members for coming and asking them to begin soliciting 
ideas from co-workers about how this event should be celebrated. She announced that

she would meet individually with each of them to discuss their roles on the project. 
The meeting was adjourned at 4:00 p.m.
1. Critique Briggs’s management of the first meeting. What, if anything, should she 
have done differently?
2. What barriers is she likely to encounter in completing this project?

Case 11.2
Ajax Project
Tran was taking his dog, Callie, on her evening walk as the sun began to set over the 
coastal range. He looked forward to this time of the day. It was an opportunity to enjoy 
some peace and quiet. It was also a time to review events on the Ajax project and plot 
his next moves.
Ajax is the code name given by CEBEX to a high-tech security system project 
funded by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD). Tran is the project manager, and 
his core team consists of 30 full-time hardware and software engineers.
Tran and his family fled Cambodia when he was 4 years old. He joined the U.S. Air 
Force when he was 18 and used the education stipend to attend Washington State Uni￾versity. He joined CEBEX upon graduating with a dual degree in mechanical and elec￾trical engineering. After working on a variety of projects for 10 years, Tran decided he 
wanted to enter management. He went to night school at the University of Washington 
to earn an MBA.
Tran became a project manager for the money. He also thought he was good at it. 
He enjoyed working with people and making the right things happen. This was his 
fifth project and up to now he was batting .500, with half of his projects being com￾pleted ahead of schedule. Tran was proud that he could now afford to send his oldest 
child to Stanford University.
Ajax was one of many defense projects the CEBEX Corporation had under contract 
with DOD. CEBEX is a huge defense company with annual sales in excess of $45 
billion and more than 120,000 employees worldwide. CEBEX’s five major business 
areas are Aeronautics, Electronic Systems, Information & Technology Services, Inte￾grated Systems & Solutions, and Space Systems. Ajax was one of several new projects 
sponsored by the Integrated Systems & Solutions Division aimed at the homeland 
security business. CEBEX was confident that it could leverage its technical expertise 
and political connections to become a major player in this growing market. Ajax is 
directed at designing, developing, and installing a security system at an important gov￾ernment installation.
Tran had two major concerns when he started the Ajax project. The first was the 
technical risks inherent in the project. In theory, the design principles made sense and 
the project used proven technology. Still, the technology had never been applied in the 
field in this matter. From experience, Tran knew there was a big difference between 
the laboratory and the real world. He also knew that integrating the audio, optical, tac￾tile, and laser subsystems would test the patience and ingenuity of his team.
The second concern involved his team. The team is pretty much split down the middle 
between hardware and electrical engineers. Not only do these engineers have different 
Final PDF to printerChapter 11 Managing Project Teams 441
lar60886_ch11_401-444.indd 441 10/14/23 10:14 am
skill sets and tend to look at problems differently, but generational differences between 
the two groups are evident as well. The hardware engineers are almost all former military 
with conservative attire and beliefs. The electrical engineers are a much motlier crew; 
most are young, single, and at times very cocky. While the hardware engineers talk about 
raising teenagers and going to Palm Desert to play golf, the electrical engineers talk about 
Vapor, the latest concert at the Gorge amphitheater, and mountain biking in Peru.
To make matters worse, tension between these two groups within CEBEX festers 
around salary issues. Electrical engineers were at a premium, and the hardware engi￾neers resented the new hires’ salary packages, which were comparable to what they 
were earning after 20 years of working for CEBEX. Still, the real money was to be 
made from the incentives associated with project performance. These were all contin￾gent on meeting project milestones and the final completion date.
Before actual work started on the project, Tran arranged a two-day team-building 
retreat at a lodge on the Olympic peninsula for his entire team as well as key staff 
from the government installation. He used this time to go over the major objectives of 
the project and unveil the basic project plan. An internal consultant facilitated several 
team-building activities that made light of cross-generational issues. Tran felt a real 
sense of camaraderie within the team.
The good feelings generated from the retreat carried over to the beginning of the 
project. The entire team bought into the mission of the project and the technical chal￾lenges it represented. Hardware and electrical engineers worked side by side to solve 
problems and build subsystems.
The project plan was built around a series of five tests, with each test being a more 
rigorous verification of total system performance. Passing each test represented a key 
milestone for the project. The team was excited about conducting the first Alpha test 
one week early—only to be disappointed by a series of minor technical glitches that 
took two weeks to resolve. The team worked extra hard to make up for the lost time. 
Tran was proud of the team and how hard the members had worked together.
The Alpha II test was conducted on schedule, but once again the system failed to 
perform. This time three weeks of debugging was needed before the team received the 
green light to move to the next phase of the project. By this time, team goodwill had 
been tested, and emotions were a bit frayed. A cloud of disappointment descended 
over the team as hopes of bonuses disappeared with the project falling further behind 
schedule. This was augmented by cynics who felt that the original schedule was unfair, 
and the deadlines were impossible to begin with.
Tran responded by starting each day with a status meeting, where the team reviewed 
what they had accomplished the previous day and set new objectives for that day. He 
believed these meetings were helpful in establishing positive momentum and reinforc￾ing a team identity among the engineers. He also went out of his way to spend more 
time with the “troops,” helping them solve problems, offering encouragement, and 
giving a sincere pat on the back when one was deserved.
He was cautiously optimistic when the time came to conduct the Alpha III test. It 
was the end of the day when the switch was turned on, but nothing happened. Within 
minutes the entire team heard the news. Screams could be heard down the hallway. 
Perhaps the most telling moment was when Tran looked down at the company’s park￾ing lot and saw most of his project team walking by themselves to their cars.
As his dog, Callie, chased some wild bunnies, Tran pondered what he should do next.
1. How effective has Tran been as a project manager? Explain.
2. What problem(s) does Tran face?
3. How would you go about solving them? Why?

Case 11.3
Franklin Equipment, Ltd.*
Franklin Equipment, Ltd. (FEL), with headquarters and main fabrication facilities in 
Saint John, New Brunswick, was founded 75 years ago to fabricate custom-designed, 
large machines for construction businesses in the Maritime Provinces. Over the years 
its product lines became strategically focused on creating rock-crushing equipment for 
dam and highway construction and for a few other markets that require the process￾ing of aggregate. FEL now designs, fabricates, and assembles stationary and portable 
rock-crushing plants and services its own products and those of its competitors.
In the 1970s, FEL began to expand its market from the Maritime Provinces to the 
rest of Canada. FEL currently has several offices and fabrication facilities throughout 
the country. More recently, FEL has made a concerted effort to market its products 
internationally.
Last month, FEL signed a contract to design and fabricate a rock-crushing plant 
for a Middle East construction project, called Project Abu Dhabi. Charles Gatenby 
secured this contract and has been assigned as project manager. This project is viewed 
as a coup because FEL has wanted to open up markets in this area for a long time and 
has had difficulty getting prospective customers to realize that FEL is a Canadian firm 
and not from the United States. Somehow these customers view all North American 
vendors as the same and are reluctant to employ any of them because of international 
political considerations.
A project of this scope typically starts with the selection of a team of managers 
responsible for various aspects of the design, fabrication, delivery, and installation of 
the product. Manager selection is important because the product design and fabrica￾tion vary with the unique needs of each customer. For example, the terrain, rock char￾acteristics, weather conditions, and logistical concerns create special problems for all 
phases of plant design and operations. In addition, environmental concerns and labor 
conditions vary from customer to customer and from region to region.
In addition to the project manager, all projects include a design engineer; an opera￾tions manager, who oversees fabrication and on-site assembly; and a cost accountant, 
who oversees all project financial and cost reporting matters. Each of these people must 
work closely together if a well-running plant is to be delivered on time and within cost 
constraints. Because international contracts often require FEL to employ host nation￾als for plant assembly and to train them for operations, a human resource manager is 
also assigned to the project team. In such cases, the human resource manager needs to 
understand the particulars of the plant specifications and then use this knowledge to 
design selection procedures and assess particular training needs. The human resource 
manager also needs to learn the relevant labor laws of the customer’s country.
FEL assigns managers to project teams based on their expertise and their avail￾ability to work on a particular project, given their other commitments. This typically 
means that managers without heavy current project commitments will be assigned to 
new projects. For instance, a manager finishing one project will likely be assigned a 
management position on a new project team. The project manager typically has little 
to say about who is assigned to his or her team.
Because he secured Project Abu Dhabi and has established positive working rela￾tionships with the Abu Dhabi customer, Gatenby was assigned to be project manager.

lar60886_ch11_401-444.indd 443 10/14/23 10:14 am
Gatenby has successfully managed similar projects. The other managers assigned to 
Project Abu Dhabi are Bill Rankins, a brilliant design engineer; Rob Perry, operations 
manager, with responsibility for fabrication and installation; Elaine Bruder, finance 
and cost accounting manager; and Sam Stonebreaker, human resource manager. Each 
of these managers has worked with the others on numerous past projects.
A few years ago, FEL began contracting for team facilitator services from sev￾eral consulting firms to help new project teams operate effectively. Last month, FEL 
recruited Carl Jobe from one of these consulting firms to be a full-time internal con￾sultant. A number of managers, including Gatenby, were so impressed with Jobe’s 
skills that they convinced FEL top management of the need to hire a permanent inter￾nal facilitator; Jobe was the obvious choice.
Because Gatenby was instrumental in hiring Jobe at FEL, he was excited at the 
prospect of using Jobe to facilitate team building among Project Abu Dhabi team 
members. Gatenby was very proud of having secured this project and had expected 
to be appointed project manager. He knew that this project’s success would be instru￾mental in advancing his own career.
Gatenby told Jobe, “This project is really important to FEL and to me personally. I 
really need for you to help us develop into a team that works well together to achieve 
the project’s goals within budget. I’ve observed your success in developing teams on 
other projects, and I expect you’ll do the same for Project Abu Dhabi. I’ll take care of 
you if you help me make this work.”
Jobe outlined for Gatenby how he would proceed. Jobe would begin by interview￾ing team members individually to learn their perceptions of each other and of the 
promises and pitfalls of being involved in this project. Meetings of the entire team 
would follow these interviews using the information he collected to help establish a 
team identity and a shared vision.
Jobe interviewed Bruder first. She expressed skepticism about whether the project 
could succeed. During the interview, Bruder appeared to be distant, and Jobe could 
not figure out why he had not established a good rapport with her. Bruder intimated 
that she expected a lot of cost overruns and a lot of missed production deadlines. But 
not knowing Jobe well, Bruder was reluctant to identify any specific barriers to the 
project’s success. While she would not directly say so, it was clear to Jobe that Bruder 
did not want to be a part of Project Abu Dhabi. Jobe left this interview confused and 
wondering what was going on.
Jobe’s next interview was with Perry, the operations manager. Perry has worked 
at FEL for 15 years, and he immediately came to the point: “This project is not going 
to work. I cannot understand why upper management keeps assigning me to work on 
projects with Rankins. We simply cannot work together, and we don’t get along. I’ve 
disliked him from day one. He keeps dropping the fact that he has earned all these 
advanced degrees from Purdue. And he keeps telling us how things are done there. I 
know he’s better educated than I am, and he’s really smart. But I’m smart, too, and am 
good at what I do. There’s no need for Rankins to make me feel like an idiot because I 
don’t have a degree. Jobe, I’ll be honest with you. Rankins has only been here for five 
years, but I hold him personally responsible for my problem with alcohol, and for its 
resulting effect on my marriage. I got divorced last year, and it’s Rankins’s fault.”
Jobe next talked with Rankins, who said, “I don’t care what you do. Perry and I 
simply can’t work closely together for the nine months it will take to get it done. One 
of us will kill the other. Ever since I arrived at FEL, Perry has hated my guts and does 
everything he can to sabotage my designs. We usually worry about customers creating 
change orders; here it’s the fabrication and operations manager who is responsible for

them. Perry second-guesses everything I do and makes design changes on his own, and 
these are always bad decisions. He is out of control. I swear he stays awake at nights, 
thinking up ways to ruin my designs. I don’t have this problem with any other manager.”
Jobe left these interviews thoroughly discouraged and could not imagine what 
would come up in his interview with Stonebreaker. But Stonebreaker was quite posi￾tive: “I enjoy these international projects where I get to travel abroad and learn about 
different cultures. I can’t wait to get started on this.”
Jobe asked Stonebreaker about the ability of various team members to work 
together. Stonebreaker replied, “No problem! We’ve all worked together before and 
have had no problems. Sure, there have been ruffled feathers and hurt feelings between 
Rankins and Perry. Rankins can be arrogant and Perry stubborn, but it’s never been 
anything that we couldn’t work around. Besides, both of them are good at what they 
do—both professionals. They’ll keep their heads on straight.”
Jobe was even more bewildered. Gatenby says this project’s success rides on Jobe’s 
facilitation skills. The finance manager appears to want off this project team. The 
design engineer and operations manager admit they detest each other and cannot work 
together. And the human resource manager, having worked on projects with Perry and 
Rankins before, expects a rosy working relationship and anticipates no problems.
Jobe had a second meeting with Gatenby. Before discussing the design of the 
team-building sessions, he asked questions to learn what Gatenby thought about 
the ability of team members to work together. Gatenby admitted that there has 
been very bad blood between Perry and Rankins but added, “That’s why we hired 
you. It’s your job to make sure that the history between those two doesn’t interfere 
with Project Abu Dhabi’s success. It’s your job to get them to work well together. 
Get it done.”
Their dialogue toward the end of this meeting progressed as follows:
Jobe: “Why do you expect Rankins and Perry to work well together, given 
their history? What incentives do they have to do so?”
Gatenby: “As you should know, FEL requires formal goal setting between project 
managers and functional managers at the beginning of each project. I’ve 
already done this with Bruder, Stonebreaker, Perry, and Rankins. Perry 
and Rankins have explicit goals stating they must work well together 
and cooperate with each other.”
Jobe: “What happens if they do not meet these goals?”
Gatenby: “I’ve already discussed this with top management. If it appears to me 
after two months that things are not working out between Perry and 
Rankins, FEL will fire Rankins.”
Jobe: “Does Perry know this?”
Gatenby: “Yes.”
1. Evaluate the criteria FEL uses to assign managers to project teams. What efficien￾cies do these criteria create? What are the resulting problems?
2. Why is it even more important that project team members work well together on 
international projects such as Project Abu Dhabi?
3. Discuss the dilemma that Jobe now faces.
4. What should Jobe recommend to Gatenby?

. . . being a good partner has become a key corporate asset. I call it 
a company’s collaborative advantage. In the global economy, a well￾developed ability to create and sustain fruitful collaborations gives 
companies a significant competitive leg up.
—Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Harvard Business School professor
It is rare in today’s flat world to find important projects that are being completed 
totally in-house. Outsourcing, or contracting significant segments of project work to 
other companies, is commonplace. For example, small high-tech businesses hire mar￾keting firms to research what features customers value in new products they are cre￾ating. Even industry giants such as Microsoft and Intel commonly hire independent 
firms to test new products they are developing.
Contracting project work has long been the norm in the construction industry, 
where firms hire general contractors who, in turn, hire and manage cadres of sub￾contractors to create new buildings and structures. For example, the Chunnel project, 
which created a transportation tunnel between France and England, involved more 
than 250 organizations. Contracting is not limited to large projects. For example, an 
insurance company worked with an outside contractor to develop an answering service 
that directs customers to specific departments and employees. The trend for the future 
suggests that more and more projects will involve working with people from different 
organizations.
This chapter extends the previous two chapters’ discussion of building and man￾aging relations by focusing specifically on issues surrounding working on projects 
with people from other organizations. First, the advantages and disadvantages of out￾sourcing project work are introduced. This is followed by a discussion of Request for 
Proposals (RFPs) and the solicitation process. Best practices used by firms to out￾source and collaborate with each other are discussed next. The focus then shifts to the 
art of negotiating, which is at the heart of effective collaboration. Negotiating skills 
and techniques for resolving disagreements and reaching optimal solutions are then

presented. The chapter closes with a brief, but important, note on managing customer 
relations. In addition, an appendix on contract management is included to augment our 
discussion of how organizations work together on projects.
12.1 Outsourcing Project Work
The term outsourcing has traditionally been applied to the transferring of business 
functions or processes (e.g., customer support, IT, accounting) to other, often foreign 
companies. For example, when you call your Internet provider to solve a technical 
problem you are likely to talk to a technician in Bangalore, India, or Bucharest, Roma￾nia. Outsourcing is now being applied to contracting significant chunks of project 
work. For example, Apple and Motorola work closely with manufacturers in China to 
develop next-generation smartphones. Toyota and DaimlerChrysler collaborate with 
suppliers to develop new automobile platforms.
The shift toward outsourcing is readily apparent in the film industry. During the 
golden era of Hollywood, huge, vertically integrated corporations made movies. Stu￾dios such as MGM, Warner Brothers, and 20th Century Fox owned large movie lots 
and employed thousands of full-time specialists—set designers, camera people, film 
editors, and directors. Star actors like Humphrey Bogart and Marilyn Monroe were 
signed to exclusive studio contracts for a set number of films (e.g., six films over three 
years). Today, most movies are made by a collection of individuals and small compa￾nies who come together to make films project by project. This structure allows risks to 
be shared and each project to be staffed with the best available talent rather than only 
studio employees. This same approach is being applied to the creation of new products 
and services. For example, see Figure 12.1. 
Figure 12.1 depicts a situation in which a zero-gravity reclining chair is being devel￾oped. The genesis for the chair comes from a mechanical engineer who developed the

idea in her garage. The inventor negotiates a contract with a catalog firm to develop 
and manufacture the chair. The catalog company in turn creates a project team of 
manufacturers, suppliers, and marketing firms to create the new chair. Each partici￾pant adds requisite expertise to the project. The catalog firm brings its brand name 
and distribution channels to the project. Tool and die firms provide customized parts, 
which are delivered to a manufacturing firm that will produce the chair. Marketing 
firms refine the design, develop packaging, and test market potential names. A project 
manager is assigned by the catalog firm to work with the inventor and the other parties 
to complete the project.
Many outsourced projects operate in a virtual environment in which people are 
linked by computers, faxes, computer-aided design systems, and video teleconferenc￾ing. They rarely, if ever, see one another face-to-face. On other projects, participants 
from different organizations work closely together, for example, at a construction site 
or in shared office space. In either case, people come and go as services are needed, 
much as in a matrix structure, but they are not formal members of one organization, 
just technical experts who form a temporary alliance with an organization, fulfill their 
contractual obligations, and then move on to the next project.
The advantages of outsourcing project work are many:
1. Cost reduction. Companies can secure competitive prices for contracted services, 
especially if the work can be outsourced offshore. Furthermore, overhead costs are 
dramatically cut, since the company no longer has to internally maintain the con￾tracted services.
2. Faster project completion. Not only can work be done more cheaply, but it can 
also be done faster. Competitive pricing means more resources for the dollar. For 
example, three Indian software engineers can be hired for the price of one Ameri￾can software engineer. Furthermore, outsourcing can provide access to equipment 
that can accelerate the completion of project tasks. For example, by contracting 
a backhoe operator you are able to accomplish in four hours what it would take a 
landscaping crew four days to complete.
3. High level of expertise. A company no longer has to keep up with technological 
advances. Instead, it can focus on developing its core competencies and hire firms 
with the know-how to work on relevant segments of the project. This can lead to 
significant improvements in the quality of the work performed.
4. Flexibility. Organizations are no longer constrained by their own resources but can 
pursue a wide range of projects by combining their resources with the talents of 
other companies. Small companies can instantly go global by working with foreign 
partners.
The disadvantages of outsourcing project work are less well documented:
1. Coordination breakdowns. Coordination of professionals from different organiza￾tions can be challenging, especially if the project work requires close collaboration 
and mutual adjustment. Breakdowns are exacerbated by physical separation with 
people working in different buildings and different cities, if not different countries.
2. Loss of control. There is the potential loss of control over the project. The core 
team depends on other organizations that they have no direct authority over. This 
was evident during the COVID-19 pandemic when so many projects came to a halt 
due to the disruption of semiconductor chip supply chain.
Final PDF to printerChapter 12 Outsourcing: Managing Interorganizational Relations 449
lar60886_ch12_445-484.indd 449 10/14/23 11:53 am
3. Conflict. Projects are more prone to interpersonal conflict, since the different par￾ticipants do not share the same values, priorities, and culture. Trust, which is essen￾tial to project success, can be difficult to forge when interactions are limited and 
people come from different organizations.
4. Security issues. Depending on the nature of the project, trade and business secrets 
may be revealed. This can be problematic if the contractor also works for your 
competitor. Confidentiality is another concern and companies have to be very care￾ful when outsourcing processes like payroll, medical transcriptions, and insurance 
information.
5. Political hot potato. Foreign outsourcing of work is perceived as a major cause of 
underemployment and U.S. companies are under increased pressure to keep jobs 
local. Furthermore, several U.S. firms have been criticized for the oppressive labor 
practices of some of their suppliers in China.
Few people disagree that reducing costs is one, if not, the primary motive behind 
outsourcing project work. However, there are limits to outsourcing (see Snapshot from 
Practice 12.1: The Boeing 787 Dreamliner), and there appears to be a shift away from 
BACKGROUND
In 2002 the basic design and plans 
for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner were 
accepted and given the charter to 
“Go.” The Dreamliner boasted the lat￾est design and revolutionary technology in the history 
of commercial air travel. But the project met bumpy 
weather. The first 787 aircraft, scheduled to be tested 
in July 2007, was delayed until December 2009. Orders 
for the advanced 787 grew quickly to over 800 planes. 
This rosy picture presented Boeing with a giant-sized 
headache. For various reasons (such as design, out￾sourcing, and labor issues) delivery dates slipped 
behind three years or more and costs ballooned to 
several billion dollars. Many analysts blame outsourc￾ing work to foreign suppliers for a majority of the cost 
and schedule overruns.
KEY FACTORS INFLUENCING 
OUTSOURCING DECISION
The Dreamliner outsourcing decision that gave 
70  percent of plane content to outside suppliers 
included 30 percent to foreign suppliers. These per￾centages were greater than any previous commercial 
plane built by Boeing. Boeing’s outsourcing rationale

was based on typical economic considerations of cost, 
sales, and risk. In Boeing’s case, this meant
Cost. Establishing partnerships with suppliers to lower 
risks and development costs, along with gaining some 
valuable expertise and process innovation.
Sales. Farming out numerous designs and components 
to foreign countries (e.g., Sweden, Italy, South Korea, 
and China) with the expectation that these countries will 
buy planes from Boeing in the future.
Risk. Recognizing the need to balance the risk 
of outsourcing at the organizational and opera￾tional levels is crucial. The different levels are 
co-dependent.
Clearly, the outsourcing decision ricocheted. Costs are 
over budget, some sales have been rescinded, custom￾ers are seeking compensation for delays, and potential 
ROI is reduced.
IMPACTS
Boeing’s brand has been seriously tarnished by delays 
and mismanagement. The process to manage the 
logistics of outsourcing was not able to handle the vol￾ume of logistical problems and change management 
issues. Chronic delays of a few nonperforming partners 
induced Boeing to buy out or support partners and 
consumed cash. Wall Street estimates cost overruns 
range between $12 and $18 billion over the original 
planned investment of $5 billion. Lessons learned from 
outsourcing of the 787 Dreamliner can point the way 
to bring back the shine to Boeing’s reputation as the 
leader in design, technology, and integration.
LESSONS LEARNED
The lessons learned in the Dreamliner launch have 
been well documented. A few obvious relevant lessons 
are noted in suggestion form here:
• Identify and analyze all risks of outsourcing at 
organization and component levels. For example, 
assess the risks and implications of farming out 
large portions (30 percent) of the design and manu￾facture of crucial components to foreign suppliers. 
Outsourcing tends to work better in noncore areas.
• Thoroughly investigate partnership capabilities and 
resources. Due diligence reduces problems.
• Develop processes for quickly addressing issues 
and problems. Increase liaison and supervi￾sion  of supply chain logistics with outsource 
partners.
• Reconsider seriously the implications of farming 
out key expertise. This runs the risk of becom￾ing fully reliant on suppliers and transferring 
unique intellectual property. Partners get risk-free 
technical know-how, high-margin markets for com￾ponent parts over the life of the plane, and perhaps 
the ability to become a future competitor.
• The risk of outsourcing complex high-technology 
components carries the burden of careful coordina￾tion and liaison.
Boeing executives have acknowledged the prob￾lems associated with outsourcing large portions of 
the 787 Dreamliner. For example, Boeing’s com￾mercial airplanes chief, Jim Albaugh, expressed to 
students at Seattle University, “We spent a lot more 
money in trying to recover [the project] than we ever 
would have spent if we’d tried to keep the key tech￾nologies closer to home. The pendulum swung too 
far.” He added that, in part, chasing the financial 
measure of return on assets led Boeing astray. Boe￾ing CEO Jim McNerney noted that the 787 game plan 
may have been overly ambitious, incorporating too 
many firsts all at once.
THE FUTURE
Although Boeing’s 787 outsourcing experience 
was very costly, outsourcing will continue and 
evolve. Lessons learned will prompt aircraft build￾ers to reevaluate future outsourcing and move on. 
Expect to see emphasis on risk- and cost-sharing 
partnerships.
The major short-term challenge for Boeing is to 
ramp up production to satisfy the hundreds of waiting 
orders. Boeing can recoup by adjusting their integra￾tive outsourcing and logistics model as a top priority.
simply nailing the best low-cost deal to securing services from companies that provide 
the best value in terms of both cost and performance. Performance is not limited to 
simply the quality of specific work but also includes the ability to collaborate and 
work together. Companies are doing their homework to determine “Can we work with 
these people?”

12.2 Request for Proposal (RFP)
Once an organization decides to outsource project work, the customer or project man￾ager is frequently responsible for developing a Request for Proposal (RFP).
The responsible project manager will require input from all stakeholders connected 
to the activities covered in the RFP. The RFP will be announced to external contrac￾tors/vendors with adequate experience to implement the project. For example, govern￾ment projects frequently advertise with a “request for proposal” to outside contractors 
for roads, buildings, airports, military hardware, and space vehicles. Similarly, busi￾nesses use RFPs to solicit bids for building a clean room, developing a new manu￾facturing process, delivering software for insurance billing, and conducting a market 
survey. In all these examples, requirements and features should be in enough detail 
that contractors have a clear description of the final deliverable that will meet the 
customer’s needs.
RFPs are important. In practice, the most common error is to offer an RFP that lacks 
sufficient detail. This lack of detail typically results in conflict issues, misunderstand￾ings, often legal claims between the contractor and owner, and ultimately a dissatisfied 
customer. All RFPs are different, but the outline in Figure 12.2 is a good starting point 
for the development of a detailed RFP. Each step is briefly described next.
1. Summary of needs and request for action. The background and a simple descrip￾tion of the final project deliverable are given first. For example, through simulated 
war games, the U.S. Navy has found their giant warships of the past are too vulner￾able against today’s technology (an example is the Silkworm antiship missiles). In 
addition, the Navy’s mission has shifted to supporting ground forces and peace￾keeping missions, which require getting closer to shore. As a result, the Navy is 
revamping ships for near-shore duty. The Navy will select three designs for further 
refinement from the responses to its RFP. In general, it is expected that the new ship 
will be capable of at least 55 knots, measure between 80 and 250 feet in length, and 
be fitted with radar absorbing panels to thwart guided missiles.
2. Statement of work (SOW) detailing the scope and major deliverables. For 
example, if the project involves a market research survey, the major deliverables 
could be design, data collection, data analysis, and providing recommendations by 
February 21, 2024, for a cost not to exceed $300,000.
3. Deliverable specifications/requirements, features, and tasks. This step should 
be very comprehensive so bid proposals from contractors can be validated and 
later used for control. Typical specifications cover physical features such as size,

quantity, materials, speed, and color. For example, an IT project might specify 
requirements for hardware, software, and training in great detail. Tasks required to 
complete deliverables can be included if they are known.
4. Responsibilities—vendor and customer. Failing to spell out the responsibilities 
for both parties is notorious for leading to serious problems when the contractor 
implements the project. For example, who pays for what? (If the contractor is to 
be on-site, will the contractor be required to pay for office space?) What are the 
limits and exclusions for the contractor? (For example, who will supply test equip￾ment?) What communication plan will be used by the contractor and owner? If 
escalation of an issue becomes necessary, what process will be used? How will 
progress be evaluated? Well-defined responsibilities will avoid many unforeseen 
problems later.
5. Project schedule. This step is concerned with getting a “hard” schedule that can 
be used for control and evaluating progress. Owners are usually very demanding in 
meeting the project schedule. In today’s business environment, time-to-market is a 
major “hot button” that influences market share, costs, and profits. The schedule 
should spell out what, who, and when.
6. Costs and payment schedule. The RFP needs to set out very clearly how, when, 
and the process for determining costs and conditions for progress payments.
7. Type of contract. Essentially there are two types of contracts—fixed-price and 
cost-plus. Fixed-price contracts agree on a price or lump sum in advance, and it 
remains as long as there are no changes to the scope provisions of the agreement. 
This type is preferred in projects that are well defined with predictable costs and 
minimal risks. The contractor must exercise care in estimating cost because any 
underestimating of costs will cause the contractor’s profit to be reduced. In cost￾plus contracts, the contractor is reimbursed for all or some of the expenses incurred 
during the performance of the contract. This fee is negotiated in advance and usu￾ally involves a percent of total costs. “Time and materials” plus a profit factor are 
typical of cost-plus contracts. Both types of contracts can include incentive clauses 
for superior performance in time and cost, or in some cases penalties—for example, 
missing the opening date of a new sports stadium. Appendix 12.1 elaborates further 
on contract management.
8. Experience and staffing. The ability of the contractor to implement the project 
may depend on specific skills; this necessary experience should be specified, along 
with assurance such staff will be available for this project.
9. Evaluation criteria. The criteria for evaluating and awarding the project contract 
should be specified. For example, selection criteria frequently include methodol￾ogy, price, schedule, and experience; in some cases, these criteria are weighted. 
Use of the outline in Figure 12.2 will help to ensure key items in the proposal are 
not omitted. A well-prepared RFP will provide contractors with sufficient guide￾lines to prepare a proposal that clearly meets the project and customer’s needs.
Selection of Contractor from Bid Proposals
Interested contractors respond to project RFPs with a written bid proposal. It is likely 
that several contractors will submit bid proposals to the customer.
The final step in the RFP process is to select the contractor who best meets the 
requirements requested in the RFP. The selection criteria given in the RFP are used 
to evaluate which contractor is awarded the contract to implement the project. Losing 
contractors should be given an explanation of the key factors that led to the selection

lar60886_ch12_445-484.indd 453 10/14/23 11:53 am
of the winning contractor/vendor; appreciation for their participation and effort should 
be acknowledged. See Figure 12.3, Contractor Evaluation Template, adapted from one 
used in practice.
12.3 Best Practices in Outsourcing Project Work
This section describes some of the best practices we have observed being used by firms 
that excel in project management (see Figure 12.4). Although the list is by no means 
comprehensive, it reflects strategies used by organizations with extensive outsourcing 
experience. These practices reveal an underlying theme in how firms approach con￾tracted work on projects. Instead of the traditional master–slave relationship between 
owner and provider or buyer and seller, all parties work together as partners sharing 
the ultimate goal of a successful project. 
Differences between the traditional approach and the partnering approach to man￾aging contracted relationships are summarized in Table 12.1.1
 Partnering requires 
more than a simple handshake. It typically entails a significant commitment of time 
and energy to forge and sustain collaborative relations among all parties. This commit￾ment is reflected in the seven best practices that will be discussed next.

Best Practices in 
Outsourcing Project 
Work
• Well-defined requirements and procedures.
• Extensive training and team-building activities.
• Well-established conflict management processes in place.
• Frequent review and status updates.
• Co-location when needed.
• Fair and incentive-laden contracts.
• Long-term outsourcing relationships.
Well-Defined Requirements and Procedures
Convincing people from different professions, organizations, and cultures to work 
together is difficult. If expectations and requirements are fuzzy or open to debate, 
this is even harder. Successful firms are very careful in selecting the work to be out￾sourced. They often choose to contract only work with clearly defined deliverables with 
Final PDF to printer454 Chapter 12 Outsourcing: Managing Interorganizational Relations
lar60886_ch12_445-484.indd 454 10/14/23 11:53 am
measurable outcomes. For example, contractors hire electric firms to install heating and 
air-conditioning systems, electronic firms use design firms to fabricate enclosures for 
their products, and software development teams outsource the testing of versions of their 
programs. In all of these cases, the technical requirements are spelled out in detail. Even 
so, communicating requirements can be troublesome, especially with foreign providers 
(see Snapshot from Practice 12.2: Four Strategies for Communicating with Outsourcers), 
and extra care has to be taken to ensure that expectations are understood.
Not only do requirements have to be spelled out, but the different firms’ project man￾agement systems need to be integrated. Common procedures and terminology need to 
be established so that different parties can work together. This can be problematic when 
you have firms with more advanced project management systems working with less 
developed organizations. Surprisingly, this often is the case when U.S. firms outsource 
software work to India. We have heard reports that Indian providers are shocked at how 
unsystematic their U.S. counterparts are in their approach to managing software projects.
The best companies address this issue up front instead of waiting for problems to 
emerge. First, they assess “fit” between providers’ project management methods and 
their own project management system. This is a prime consideration in choosing ven￾dors. Work requirements and deliverables are spelled out in detail in the procurement 
process. They invest significant time and energy in establishing project communica￾tion systems to support effective collaboration.
Finally, whenever you work with other organizations on projects, security is an 
important issue. Security extends beyond competitive secrets and technology to 
include access to information systems. Firms have to establish robust safeguards to 
prevent information access and the introduction of viruses due to less secure provider 
systems. Information technology security is an additional cost and risk that needs to be 
addressed up front before outsourcing project work.
Partnering Approach Traditional Approach
Mutual trust forms the basis for strong working
 relationships.
Suspicion and distrust; each party is wary of the
 motives for actions by the other.
Shared goals and objectives ensure common
 direction.
Each party’s goals and objectives, although
 similar, are geared to what is best for that party.
Joint project team exists with high level of
 interaction.
Independent project teams; teams are spatially
 separated with managed interactions.
Open communications avoid misdirection and 
 bolster effective working relationships.
Communications are structured and guarded.
Long-term commitment provides the opportunity
 to attain continuous improvement.
Single project contracting is normal.
Objective critique is geared to candid assessment
 of performance.
Objectivity is limited due to fear of reprisal and
 lack of continuous improvement opportunity.
Access to each other’s organization resources is
 available.
Access is limited with structured procedures
 and self-preservation taking priority over total
 optimization.
Total company involvement requires commitment
 from CEO to team members.
Involvement is normally limited to project-level
 personnel.
Integration of administrative systems equipment
 takes place.
Duplication and/or translation takes place with
 attendant costs and delays.
Risk is shared jointly among the partners,
which encourages innovation and continuous 
improvement.
Risk is transferred to the other party.

Dr. Adam Kolawa offers four strategies 
for overcoming poor communication 
with offshore project partners.
STRATEGY 1: RECOGNIZE 
CULTURAL DIFFERENCES
Realize that not everyone you communicate with 
shares your assumptions. What is obvious to you is not 
necessarily obvious to your partner. This is especially 
true with foreign outsourcers. As an American, you 
likely assume that laws are generally obeyed. Believe 
it or not, that’s generally not true in most of the world, 
where laws are guidelines that are not necessarily fol￾lowed. This can lead to major communication prob￾lems! You think that if you write a contract, everybody 
is going to adhere to it. For many people, a contract is 
merely a suggestion.
STRATEGY 2: CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORDS
When you explain your requirements to an out￾sourcer, word choice is critical. For many outsourc￾ers, English is still a foreign language—even in India, 
where both outsourcing and the English language 
are common. No matter how prevalent English has 
become, your outsourcer might have a basic under￾standing of each word you utter yet be not com￾pletely clear on the exact meaning of the message 
you’re trying to convey. This is why you should speak 
in a direct manner using short sentences made of 
basic, simple words.
STRATEGY 3: CONFIRM YOUR 
REQUIREMENTS
You should take the following steps to confirm that the 
outsourcer thoroughly understands your requirements:
1. Document your requirements. Follow up your conver￾sations in writing. Commit your requirements to paper 
for the outsourcer. Many people understand written 
language better than spoken language, probably 
because they have more time to process the message.
2. Insist your outsourcer re-document your require￾ments. Leave nothing to chance. Require outsourc￾ers to write the requirements in their own words. If 
outsourcers cannot relay to you what you explained 
to them, then they didn’t understand.
3. Request a prototype. After the requirements are 
written, ask the outsourcer to create a prototype 
for you. This is a safety net to ensure that your 
wants and needs are positively understood. Ask 
the provider to sketch what you want your final 
product to look like or build a quick, simple pro￾gram that reflects how the final product will look.
STRATEGY 4: SET DEADLINES
Another important cultural difference relates to sched￾ules and deadlines. To most Americans, a deadline is a 
set completion date. In many other cultures, a deadline 
is a suggestion that maybe something will be finished 
by that indicated date. To ensure that outsourced work 
is completed on time it is imperative to add a penalty 
clause to your contract or enforce late fees.
Although these strategies were directed toward 
working with foreign outsourcers, you would be sur￾prised to find how many project managers use them 
when working with their American counterparts!

with Outsourcers*

Outsourcers,” Enterprise Systems Journal, www.esj.com. 
Accessed 9/12/05.
Extensive Training and Team-Building Activities
Too often managers become preoccupied with the plans and technical challenges of 
the project and assume that people’s issues will work themselves out over time. Smart 
firms recognize that people issues are as important, if not more important, than tech￾nical issues. They train their personnel to work effectively with people from other 
organizations and countries. This training is pervasive. It is not limited to management 
but involves all the people, at all levels, who interact with and are dependent upon out￾sourcers. Whether in a general class on negotiation or a specific one on working with 
Chinese programmers, team members are provided with a theoretical understanding 
of the barriers to collaboration as well as the skills and procedures to be successful.
The training is augmented by interorganizational team-building sessions designed 
to forge healthy relationships before the project begins. Team-building workshops 
Final PDF to printer456 Chapter 12 Outsourcing: Managing Interorganizational Relations
lar60886_ch12_445-484.indd 456 10/14/23 11:53 am
involve the key players from the different firms, for example, engineers, architects, 
lawyers, specialists, and other staff. In many cases, firms find it useful to hire an out￾side consultant to design and facilitate the sessions. Such a consultant is typically well 
versed in interorganizational team building and can provide an impartial perspective 
to the workshop.
The length and design of the team-building sessions will depend on the experience, 
commitment, and skill level of the participants. For example, one project, in which the 
owner and the contractors were relatively inexperienced at working together, utilized a 
two-day workshop. The first day was devoted to ice-breaking activities and establish￾ing the rationale behind partnering. The conceptual foundation was supported by exer￾cises and mini-lectures on teamwork, synergy, win/win, and constructive feedback. 
The second day began by examining the problems and barriers that prevented collabo￾ration in the past. Representatives from the different organizations were separated and 
each asked the following:
∙ What actions do the other groups engage in that create problems for us?
∙ What actions do we engage in that we think create problems for them?
∙ What recommendations would we make to improve the situation?
The groups shared their responses and asked questions on points needing clarifica￾tion. Agreements and disparities in the lists were noted and specific problems were 
identified. Once problem areas were noted, each group was assigned the task of iden￾tifying its specific interests and goals for the project. Goals were shared across groups, 
and special attention was devoted to establishing what goals they had in common. 
Recognition of shared goals is critical for transforming different groups into a cohe￾sive team.
Team-building sessions often culminate with the creation of a partnering charter
signed by all of the participants. This charter states their common goals for the project 
as well as the procedures that will be used to achieve these goals (see Figure 12.5 for 
an example of the first page of a project charter). 
Well-Established Conflict Management Processes in Place
Conflict is inevitable on a project and, as pointed out in Chapter 11, disagreements 
handled effectively can elevate performance. Dysfunctional conflict, however, can 
catch fire and severely undermine project success. Outsourced projects are suscep￾tible to conflicts, since people are unaccustomed to working together and have dif￾ferent values and perspectives. Successful firms invest significant time and energy 
up front in establishing the “rules of engagement” so that disagreements are handled 
constructively.
Escalation is the primary control mechanism for dealing with and resolving prob￾lems. The basic principle is that problems should be resolved at the lowest level within 
a set time limit (say, 24 hours), or they are “escalated” to the next level of manage￾ment. If so, the principals have the same time limit to resolve the problem, or it gets 
passed on to the next higher level. No action is not an option. Nor can one participant 
force concessions from the other by simply delaying the decision. There is no shame 
in pushing significant problems up the hierarchy; at the same time, managers should 
be quick to point out to subordinates those problems or questions that they should have 
been able to resolve on their own.
If possible, key personnel from the respective organizations are brought together 
to discuss potential problems and responses. This is usually part of the coordinated 
series of team-building activities discussed earlier. Particular attention is devoted to

establishing the change management control system where problems often erupt. Peo￾ple who are dependent on each other try to identify potential problems that may occur 
and agree in advance how they should be resolved. See Snapshot from Practice 12.3: 
“Partnering” a Flu Shot for Projects for the benefits of doing this.
Finally, principled negotiation is the norm for resolving problems and reaching 
agreements. This approach, which emphasizes collaborative problem solving, is dis￾cussed in detail later in this chapter.
Frequent Review and Status Updates
Project managers and other key personnel from all involved organizations meet on a 
regular basis to review and assess project performance. Collaborating as partners is 
considered a legitimate project priority and is assessed along with time, cost, and per￾formance. Teamwork, communication, and timely problem resolution are evaluated. 
This provides a forum for identifying problems not only with the project but also with 
working relationships so that they can be resolved quickly and appropriately.
Before starting a bond-financed 
school construction project, Ohio 
does what a theater company does 
before opening night—it holds a dress 
rehearsal. Led by Cleveland-based 
Project Management Consultants, state and local 
school officials, construction managers, and architects 
get together before building begins to figure out how 
to talk to each other and how to handle problems. 
Each party discusses problems that have occurred in 
the past and collectively they problem solve ways for 
preventing them from occurring in the current project. 
Consultants help participants develop a set of guide￾lines for working together.
Just as a theatrical dress rehearsal can allow a 
company to find and fix glitches before they ruin a 
show, preconstruction partnering can find early solu￾tions to problems before they become lawsuits. For 
example, during the discussions it becomes apparent 
that different parties are interpreting a key require￾ment differently. Instead of waiting for this difference 
to escalate into a major problem, the parties reach a 
shared understanding before work begins.
“This works because traditionally everyone does 
their own work on a project, behind their own walls,” 
said Jeffrey Applebaum, a construction lawyer and 
managing director of Project Management Consul￾tants, a wholly owned subsidiary of the law firm of 
Thompson, Hine, & Flory. “We’re taking down the walls. 
This is more efficient.”

debilitating effects of litigation, work stoppages, and 
communication breakdowns. “Every building construc￾tion project is a candidate for the flu,” Canan said. “We 
see partnering as a vaccination.”

More and more companies are using online surveys to collect data from all proj￾ect participants about the quality of working relations (see Figure 12.6 for a partial 
example). With this data, one can gauge the “pulse” of the project and identify issues 
that need to be addressed. Comparison of survey responses period by period permits 
tracking areas of improvement and potential problems. In some cases, follow-up team￾building sessions are used to focus on specific problems and recharge collaboration. 
Finally, when the time to celebrate a significant milestone arrives, no matter who 
is responsible, all parties gather if possible to celebrate the success. This reinforces a 
common purpose and project identity. It also establishes positive momentum going 
into the next phase of the project.
Co-location When Needed
One of the best ways to overcome interorganizational friction is to have people from 
each organization working side by side on the project. Smart companies rent or make 
available the necessary accommodations so that all key project personnel can work 
collectively together. This allows the high degree of face-to-face interaction needed to 
coordinate activities, solve difficult problems, and form a common bond. This is espe￾cially relevant for complex projects in which close collaboration from different par￾ties is required to be successful. For example, the U.S. government provides housing 
and common office space for all key contractors responsible for developing disaster 
response plans.

Our experience tells us that co-location is critical and well worth the added expense 
and inconvenience. When creating this is not practically possible, the travel bud￾get for the project should contain ample funds to support timely travel to different 
organizations.
Co-location is less relevant for independent work that does not require ongoing 
coordination between professionals from different organizations. This would be the 
case if you were outsourcing discrete, independent deliverables, like beta testing or a 
marketing campaign. Here normal channels of communication could handle the coor￾dination issues.
Fair and Incentive-Laden Contracts
When negotiating contracts, the goal is to reach a fair deal for all involved. Managers 
recognize that cohesion and cooperation are undermined if one party feels s/he is being 
unfairly treated by others. They also realize that negotiating the best deal in terms of 
price can come back to haunt them with shoddy work and change order gouging.
Performance-based contracts, in which significant incentives are established based 
on the priorities of the project, are becoming increasingly popular. For example, if 
time is critical, then contractors accrue payoffs for beating deadlines; if the scope is 
critical, then bonuses are issued for exceeding performance expectations. At the same 
time, contractors are held accountable with penalty clauses for failure to perform up to 
standard, meet deadlines, and/or control costs. More specific information about differ￾ent types of contracts is presented in this chapter’s appendix on contract management.
Companies recognize that contracts can discourage continuous improvement and 
innovation. Instead of trying some new, promising technique that may reduce costs, 
contractors will avoid the risks and apply tried-and-true methods to meet contracted 
requirements. Companies that treat contractors as partners consider continuous 
improvement as a joint effort to eliminate waste and pursue opportunities for cost sav￾ings. Risks as well as benefits are typically shared 50/50 between the principals, with 
the owner adhering to a fast-track review of proposed changes.
How the U.S. Department of Defense reaps the benefits of continuous improve￾ment through value engineering is highlighted in Snapshot from Practice 12.4: U.S. 
Department of Defense’s Value Engineering Awards.
Long-Term Outsourcing Relationships
Many companies recognize that major benefits can be enjoyed when outsourcing 
arrangements extend across multiple projects and are long term. For example, Corn￾ing and Toyota are among the many firms that have forged a network of long-term 
strategic partnerships with their suppliers. The average large corporation is involved 
in around 30 alliances today versus fewer than 3 in the early 1990s. Among the many 
advantages for establishing a long-term partnership are the following:
∙ Reduced administrative costs. The costs associated with bidding and selecting 
a contractor are eliminated. Contract administration costs are reduced as partners 
become knowledgeable of their counterpart’s legal concerns.
∙ More efficient utilization of resources. Contractors have a known forecast of 
work, while owners are able to concentrate their workforce on core businesses and 
avoid the demanding swings of project support.
∙ Improved communication. As partners gain experience with each other, they 
develop a common language and perspective, which reduces misunderstanding and 
enhances collaboration.
Final PDF to printerChapter 12 Outsourcing: Managing Interorganizational Relations 461
lar60886_ch12_445-484.indd 461 10/14/23 11:53 am
∙ Improved innovation. The partners are able to discuss innovation and associated 
risks in a more open manner and share risks and rewards fairly.
∙ Improved performance. Over time partners become more familiar with each oth￾er’s standards and expectations and are able to apply lessons learned from previous 
projects to current projects.
Working as partners is a conscious effort on the part of management to form collab￾orative relationships with personnel from different organizations to complete a proj￾ect. For outsourcing to work, the individuals involved need to be effective negotiators 
capable of merging interests and discovering solutions to problems that contribute to 
the project. The next section addresses some of the key skills and techniques associ￾ated with effective negotiation.
12.4 The Art of Negotiating
Effective negotiating is critical to successful collaboration. All it takes is one key 
problem to explode to convert a sense of “we” into “us versus them.” At the same 
time, negotiating is pervasive through all aspects of project management work. Project 
managers must negotiate support and funding from top management. They must nego￾tiate staff and technical input from functional managers. They must coordinate with 
other project managers and negotiate project priorities and commitments. They must 
negotiate within their project team to determine assignments, deadlines, standards, 
and priorities. Project managers must negotiate prices and standards with vendors and 
LO 12-4
Practice principled 
negotiation.
As part of an effort to cut costs, the U.S. 
Department of Defense (DoD) issues 
annual Value Engineering Awards. 
Value engineering is a systematic pro￾cess to analyze functions to identify 
actions to reduce cost, increase quality, and improve 
mission capabilities across the entire spectrum of DoD 
systems, processes, and organizations. The Value Engi￾neering Awards Program is an acknowledgment of 
outstanding achievements and encourages additional 
projects to improve in-house and contractor productivity.
In 2018, 36 individuals and project teams received 
recognition from the DoD, reporting over $6 billion in 
savings and cost reductions.
Marc Dalangin received the award for his work on 
the M151 Spotting Scope Upgrade project. The M151 
Spotting Scope is a compact, light, high-power optical 
device that allows the identification and recognition of 
targets at long distances (1,000+ yards). The scope is 
weather-resistant and fog-proof. The M151 has been 
used for many years by U.S. Army snipers to identify and 
confirm targets. Given recent developments, the M151 
was deemed no longer compatible with current weapons 
and the operational mode it was intended to support.
Dalangin was part of a project team charged with 
replacing the M151. Dalangin, on his own, worked 
closely with the sniper community at Ft. Benning, Geor￾gia, to come up with a novel solution. Instead of replac￾ing the scope, he developed and designed a Mil-Grid 
reticle that improved the performance of the M151 
scope. What, you may ask, is a reticle? A reticle is a 
series of fine lines in the eyepiece of a scope, used as a 
measuring scale for locating objects.
The army accepted Dalangin’s proposal to upgrade 
the spotting scope with the Mil-Grid reticle as well as 
other minor upgrades. The Value Engineering effort 
resulted in cost avoidance of over $4.5 million during 
fiscal 2017 and 2018. Not only were there significant 
cost savings, but the new scope contributed to army 
operational readiness by enhancing the army’s sniper 
capability for deploying soldiers.

suppliers. A firm understanding of the negotiating process, skills, and tactics is essen￾tial to project success.
Many people approach negotiating as if it were a competitive contest. Negotiators 
are out to win as much as they can for their side. Success is measured by how much is 
gained compared with the other party. While this may be applicable when negotiating 
the sale of a house, it is not true for project management. Project management is not 
a contest! First, the people working on the project, whether they represent different 
companies or departments within the same organization, are not enemies or competi￾tors but, rather, allies or partners. They have formed a temporary alliance to complete 
a project. For this alliance to work requires a certain degree of trust, cooperation, and 
honesty.
Second, if conflicts escalate to the point where negotiations break down and the 
project comes to a halt, then everyone loses. Third, unlike bartering with a street ven￾dor, the people involved on project work have to continue to work together. Therefore, 
it behooves them to resolve disagreements in a way that contributes to healthy working 
relationships. Finally, as pointed out in Chapter 11, conflict on a project can be good. 
When dealt with effectively, it can lead to innovation, better decisions, and more cre￾ative problem solving.
Project managers accept this noncompetitive view of negotiation and realize that 
negotiation is essentially a two-part process: the first part deals with reaching an 
agreement; the second part is the implementation of that agreement. It is the imple￾mentation phase, not the agreement itself, that determines the success of negotiations. 
All too often, managers reach an agreement with someone, only to find out later that 
he failed to do what he agreed to do or that his actual response fell far short of expecta￾tions. Experienced project managers recognize that implementation is based on satis￾faction not only with the outcome but also with the process by which the agreement 
was reached. If someone feels bullied or tricked into doing something, this feeling will 
invariably be reflected by half-hearted performance.
Veteran project managers do the best they can to merge individual interests with 
what is best for the project and come up with effective solutions to problems. Fisher 
and Ury from the Harvard Negotiation Project champion an approach to negotiating 
that embodies these goals.2
 It emphasizes developing win/win solutions while protect￾ing yourself against those who would take advantage of your forthrightness. Their 
approach is called principled negotiation and is based on four key points, which are 
listed in Table 12.2 and discussed in the following sections.
1. Separate the People from the Problem
Too often personal relations become entangled with the substantive issues under con￾sideration. Instead of attacking the problem(s), people attack each other. Once people 
feel attacked or threatened, their energy naturally goes to defending themselves, not to 
solving the problem. The key, then, is to focus on the problem—not the other person—
during negotiation. Avoid personalizing the negotiation and framing the negotiation as

TABLE 12.2
Principled 
Negotiation
1. Separate the people from the problem.
2. Focus on interests, not positions.
3. Invent options for mutual gain.
4. When possible, use objective criteria.

lar60886_ch12_445-484.indd 463 10/14/23 11:53 am
a contest. Instead, try to keep the focus on the problem to be resolved. In Fisher and 
Ury’s words, be hard on the problem, soft on the people.
By keeping the focus on the issues and not the personalities, negotiators are better 
able to let the other person blow off steam. On important problems, it is not uncom￾mon for people to become upset, frustrated, and angry. However, one angry attack 
produces an angry counterattack and the discussion quickly escalates into a heated 
argument, an emotional chain reaction.
In some cases, people use anger as a means of intimidating and forcing concessions 
because the other person wishes to preserve the relationship. When people become 
emotional, negotiators should keep a cool head and remember the old German prov￾erb “Let anger fly out the window.”3
 In other words, in the face of an emotional out￾burst, imagine opening a window and letting the heat of the anger out the window. 
Avoid taking things personally, and redirect personal attacks back to the question at 
hand. Don’t react to the emotional outburst, but try to find the issues that triggered it. 
Skilled negotiators keep their cool under stressful times and, at the same time, build a 
bond with others by empathizing and acknowledging common sources of frustration 
and anger.
While it is important to separate the people from the problem during actual 
negotiations, it is beneficial to have a friendly rapport with the other person prior to 
negotiating. Friendly rapport is consistent with the social network tenet, introduced in 
Chapter 10, of building a relationship before you need it. If, in the past, the relationship 
has been marked by healthy give-and-take, in which both parties have demonstrated a 
willingness to accommodate the interests of the other, then neither individual is likely 
to adopt an immediate win/lose perspective. Furthermore, a positive relationship adds 
a common interest beyond the specific points of contention. Not only do both parties 
want to reach an agreement that suits their individual interests, but they also want to do 
so in a manner that preserves their relationship. Each is therefore more likely to seek 
solutions that are mutually beneficial.
2. Focus on Interests, Not Positions
Negotiations often stall when people focus on positions:
I’m willing to pay $10,000. No, it will cost $15,000.
I need it done by Monday. That’s impossible, we can’t have it ready until Wednesday.
While such interchanges are common during preliminary discussions, managers must 
prevent this initial posturing from becoming polarized. When such positions are stated, 
attacked, and then defended, each party figuratively begins to draw a line s/he will not 
cross. This line creates a win/lose scenario in which someone has to lose by crossing 
the line in order to reach an agreement. As such, the negotiations can become a war of 
wills, with concessions being seen as a loss of face.
The key is to focus on the interests behind your positions (what you are trying to 
achieve) and separate these goals from your ego as best you can. Not only should you 
be driven by your interests, but you should try to identify the interests of the other 
party. Ask why it will cost so much or why it can’t be done by Monday. At the same 
time, make your own interests come alive. Don’t just say that it is critical that it be 
done by Monday; explain what will happen if it isn’t done by Monday.
Sometimes when the true interests of both parties are revealed, there is no basis for 
conflict. Take, for example, the Monday versus Wednesday argument. This argument

could apply to a scenario involving a project manager and the production manager of 
a small, local firm that was contracted to produce prototypes of a new generation of 
computer mouse. The project manager needs the prototypes on Monday to demon￾strate to a user’s focus group. The production manager said it would be impossible. 
The project manager said this would be embarrassing because Marketing had spent 
a lot of time and effort setting up this demonstration. The production manager again 
denied the request and added that he had already had to schedule overtime to meet 
the Wednesday delivery date. However, when the project manager revealed that the 
purpose of the focus group was to gauge consumers’ reactions to the color and shape 
of the new devices, not the finished product, the conflict disappeared. The production 
manager told the project manager that s/he could pick up the samples today if s/he 
wanted because production had an excess supply of shells.
When focusing on interests, it is important to practice the following communication 
habit: seek first to understand, then to be understood. This involves what Stephen 
Covey calls empathetic listening, which allows a person to fully understand another 
person’s frame of reference—not only what that person is saying but also how s/he 
feels. Covey asserts that people have an inherent need to be understood. He goes on to 
observe that satisfied needs do not motivate human behavior; only unsatisfied needs 
do. People try to go to sleep when they are tired, not when they are rested. The key 
point is that until people believe they are being understood, they will repeat their points 
and reformulate their arguments.4
 If, on the other hand, you satisfy this need by seek￾ing first to understand, then the other party is free to understand your interests and 
focus directly on the issues at hand. Seeking to understand requires discipline and 
compassion. Instead of responding to the other person by asserting your agenda, 
respond by summarizing both the facts and the feelings behind what the other person 
has said and checking the accuracy of comprehension.
3. Invent Options for Mutual Gain
Once the individuals involved have identified their interests, then they can explore 
options for mutual gain. This is not easy. Stressful negotiations inhibit creativity 
and free exchange. What is required is collaborative brainstorming in which people 
work together to solve the problem in a way that will lead to a win/win scenario. The 
key to brainstorming is separating the inventing from the deciding. Begin by taking 
15 minutes to generate as many options as possible. No matter how outlandish any 
option is, it should not be subject to criticism or immediate rejection. People should 
feed off the ideas of others to generate new ideas. When all the possible options are 
exhausted, they should then sort through the ideas that were generated to focus on 
those with the greatest possibilities.
Clarifying interests and exploring mutual options create the opportunity for dove￾tailing interests. Dovetailing means one person identifies options that are of low cost 
to him or her but of high interest to the other party. This is only possible if each party 
knows what the other’s needs are. For example, in negotiating price with a parts sup￾plier, a project manager learned from the discussion that the supplier was in a cash 
flow squeeze after purchasing a very expensive fabrication machine. Needed cash was 
the primary reason the supplier had taken such a rigid position on price. During the 
brainstorming session, one of the options presented was to prepay for the order instead 
of the usual payment on delivery arrangement. Both parties seized on this option and 
reached an amicable agreement in which the project manager would pay the supplier

for the entire job in advance in exchange for a faster turnaround time and a signifi￾cant price reduction. Such opportunities for win/win agreements are often overlooked 
because the negotiators become fixated on solving their problems and not on opportu￾nities to solve the other person’s problems.
4. When Possible, Use Objective Criteria
Most established industries and professions have developed standards and rules to 
help them deal with common areas of dispute. For example, both buyers and sellers 
rely on the blue book to establish price parameters for a used car. The construction 
industry has building codes and fair practice policies to resolve proof of quality and 
safe work procedures. The legal profession uses precedents to adjudicate claims of 
wrongdoing.
Whenever possible, you should insist on using external, objective criteria to settle 
disagreements. For example, a disagreement arose between a regional airlines firm 
and the independent accounting team entrusted with preparing the annual financial 
statement. The airline firm had made a significant investment by leasing several used 
airplanes from a larger airline. The dispute involved whether this lease should be clas￾sified as an operating or capital lease. This was important to the airline because if the 
purchase was classified as an operating lease, then the associated debt would not have 
to be recorded in the financial statement. However, if the purchase was classified as a 
capital lease, then the debt would be factored into the financial statement and the debt/
equity ratio would be much less attractive to stockholders and would-be investors. The 
two parties resolved this dispute by deferring to formulas established by the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board. As it turned out, the accounting team was correct, but, 
by deferring to objective standards, they were able to deflect the disappointment of the 
airline managers away from the accounting team and preserve a professional relation￾ship with that firm.
Dealing with Unreasonable People
Most people working on projects realize that in the long run, it is beneficial to work 
toward mutually satisfying solutions. Still, occasionally you encounter someone who 
has a dominant win/lose attitude about life and will be difficult to deal with. Fisher 
and Ury recommend that you use negotiation jujitsu when dealing with such a person. 
That is, when the other person begins to push, don’t push back. As in the martial arts, 
avoid pitting your strengths against another’s directly; instead, use your skill to step 
aside and turn that person’s strength to your ends. When someone adamantly sets forth 
a position, neither reject it nor accept it. Treat it as a possible option and then look for 
the interests behind it. Instead of defending your ideas, invite criticism and advice. 
Ask why it’s a bad idea and discover the other’s underlying interest.
Those who use negotiation jujitsu rely on two primary weapons. They ask ques￾tions instead of making statements. Questions allow for interests to surface and do not 
provide the opponent with something to attack. The second weapon is silence. If the 
other person makes an unreasonable proposal or attacks you personally, just sit there 
and don’t say a word. Wait for the other party to break the stalemate by answering your 
question or coming up with a new suggestion.
The best defense against unreasonable, win/lose negotiators is having what Fisher 
and Ury call a strong best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA). They 
point out that people try to reach an agreement to produce something better than the 
result of not negotiating with that person. What those results would be is the true 
benchmark for determining whether you should accept an agreement. A strong 
Final PDF to printer466 Chapter 12 Outsourcing: Managing Interorganizational Relations
lar60886_ch12_445-484.indd 466 10/14/23 11:53 am
BATNA gives you the power to walk away and say, “No deal unless we work toward 
a win/win scenario.”
Your BATNA reflects how dependent you are on the other party. If you are nego￾tiating price and delivery dates and can choose from a number of reputable suppliers, 
then you have a strong BATNA. If, on the other hand, there is only one vendor who 
can supply you with specific, critical material on time, then you have a weak BATNA. 
Under these circumstances, you may be forced to concede to the vendor’s demands. 
At the same time, you should begin to explore ways of increasing your BATNA for 
future negotiations. This can be done by reducing your dependency on that supplier. 
You could begin to find substitutable material or negotiate better lead times with other 
vendors.
Negotiating is an art. There are many intangibles involved. This section has reviewed 
some time-tested principles of effective negotiating based on the groundbreaking work 
of Fisher and Ury. Given the significance of negotiating, you are encouraged to read 
their book as well as others on negotiating. In addition, attending training workshops 
can provide an opportunity to practice these skills. You should also take advantage of 
day-to-day interactions to sharpen your negotiating acumen.
12.5 A Note on Managing Customer Relations
In Chapter 4 it was emphasized that ultimate success is not determined by whether 
the project was completed on time, within budget, or according to specifications but 
on whether the customer is satisfied with what has been accomplished. Customer sat￾isfaction is the bottom line. Bad news travels faster and farther than good news. For 
every happy customer who shares his or her satisfaction regarding a particular product 
or service with another person, a dissatisfied customer is likely to share his or her dis￾satisfaction with eight other people. Project managers need to cultivate positive work￾ing relations with clients to preserve their reputations.
Customer satisfaction is a complex phenomenon. One simple but useful way of 
viewing customer satisfaction is in terms of met expectations. According to this 
model, customer satisfaction is a function of the extent to which perceived perfor￾mance (or outcome) exceeds expectations. Mathematically, this relationship can be 
represented as the ratio between perceived performance and expected performance 
(see Figure 12.7). When performance falls short of expectations (ratio < 1), the cus￾tomer is dissatisfied. If the performance matches expectations (ratio = 1), the cus￾tomer is satisfied. If the performance exceeds expectations (ratio > 1), the customer is 
very satisfied or even delighted.
High customer satisfaction is the goal of most projects. However, profitability is 
another major concern. Exceeding expectations typically entails additional costs. For 
example, completing a construction project two weeks ahead of schedule may involve 
significant overtime expenses. Similarly, exceeding reliability requirements for a new 
electronic component may involve considerably more design and debugging effort. 
Under most circumstances, the most profitable arrangement occurs when the custom￾er’s expectations are only slightly exceeded. Returning to the mathematical model, with 
all other things being equal, one should strive for a satisfaction ratio of 1.05, not 1.5!

The met-expectations model of customer satisfaction highlights the point that 
whether a client is dissatisfied or delighted with a project is not based on hard facts 
and objective data but on perceptions and expectations. For example, a customer may 
be dissatisfied with a project that was completed ahead of schedule and under bud￾get if he thought the work was poor quality and that his fears and concerns were not 
adequately addressed. Conversely, a customer may be very satisfied with a project that 
was over budget and behind schedule if s/he felt the project team protected his or her 
interests and did the best job possible under adverse circumstances.
Project managers must be skilled at managing customer expectations and percep￾tions. Too often they deal with these expectations after the fact when they try to alle￾viate a client’s dissatisfaction by carefully explaining why the project cost more or 
took longer than planned. A more proactive approach is to begin to shape the proper 
expectations up front and accept that this is an ongoing process throughout the life of 
a project. Project managers need to direct their attention both to the customer’s base 
expectations, the standard by which perceived performance will be evaluated, and to 
the customer’s perceptions of actual performance. The ultimate goal is to educate cli￾ents so that they can make a valid judgment as to project performance.
Managing customer expectations begins during the preliminary project approval 
phase of negotiations. It is important to avoid the temptation to oversell the virtues of 
a project to win approval because this may create unrealistic expectations that may be 
too difficult, if not impossible, to achieve. At the same time, project proponents have 
been known to lower customer expectations by underselling projects. If the estimated 
completion time is 10 to 12 weeks, they will promise to have the project completed 
within 12 to 14 weeks, therefore increasing the chances of exceeding customer expec￾tations by getting the project completed early.
Once the project is authorized, the project manager and team need to work closely 
with the client organization to develop a well-defined project scope statement that 
clearly states the objectives, parameters, and limits of the project work. The project 
scope statement is essential to establishing customer expectations regarding the proj￾ect. It is critical that all parties are in agreement as to what is to be accomplished. It is 
also important to share significant risks that might disrupt project execution. Custom￾ers do not like surprises, and if they are aware in advance of potential problems they 
are much more likely to be accepting of the consequences.
Once the project is initiated it is important to keep customers abreast of project 
progress. No longer do project managers simply take orders from customers and tell 
them to return when the project is done. More and more organizations and their project 
managers are treating their customers as de facto members of the project team and 
are actively involving them in key aspects of project work. In the case of consulting 
assignments, project managers sometimes morph into members of the client organiza￾tion (see Research Highlight 12.1: IT Project Managers).
Project managers need to keep customers informed of project developments so 
that customers can make adjustments in their own plans. When circumstances dictate 
changing the scope or priorities of the project, project managers need to be quick to 
spell out as best they can the implications of these changes to the customers so that 
they can make an informed choice. Active customer involvement allows customers to 
naturally adjust their expectations in accordance with the decisions and events that 
transpire on a project while the customer’s presence keeps the project team focused on 
the customer’s objectives for the project.
Active customer involvement also provides a firmer basis for assessing project 
performance. The customer not only sees the results of the project but also acquires 
Final PDF to printerlar60886_ch12_445-484.indd 468 10/14/23 11:53 am
468
glimpses of the effort and actions that produced those results. Naturally, project man￾agers want to make sure these glimpses reflect favorably on their project teams, so 
they exercise extra care that customer interactions are handled in a competent and pro￾fessional manner. In some respects, customer perceptions of performance are shaped 
more by how well the project team deals with adversity than by actual performance. 
Project managers can impress customers with how diligently they deal with unex￾pected problems and setbacks. Likewise, industry analysts have noted that customer 
dissatisfaction can be transformed into customer satisfaction by quickly correcting 
mistakes and being extremely responsive to customer concerns.
Managing customer relations on a project is a broad topic; we have only highlighted 
some of the central issues involved. This brief segment concludes with two words of 
advice passed on by veteran project managers:
Speak with one voice. Nothing erodes confidence in a project more than for a customer to 
receive conflicting messages from different project members. The project manager should 
remind team members of this fact and work with them to ensure that appropriate information 
is shared with customers.
Speak the language of the customer. Too often project members respond to customer inqui￾ries with technical jargon that exceeds the customer’s vocabulary. Project managers and 
members need to describe problems, trade-offs, and solutions in ways that the customer can 
understand.
Webber and Torti studied the 
multiple roles project managers 
play on IT projects. Based on a 
comprehensive set of interviews 
with project managers and cli￾ents in three different information￾technology service organizations, they identified 
five key roles critical to successfully implement 
IT projects in client organizations: entrepreneur, 
politician, friend, marketer, and coach. They are 
described in part in Table 12.3.
Webber and Torti observed that instead of 
maintaining a clearly defined relationship with the 
client, project managers become part of the client 
organization. They reported that project managers 
attempt to “dress like the client, act like the client, 
and participate in the client organization’s activities 
(i.e., social gatherings, blood drives, etc.).” They 
become such an integral part of their existence that 
many client employees, over the course of time, 
forget that the project manager is not an employee 
of the client organization. This helps establish a 
degree of trust essential to effective collaboration.

Summary Outsourcing has become an integral part of project management. The disruption of 
global supply chains by the COVID-19 pandemic has caused leaders to rethink being 
so dependent upon foreign suppliers, contractors, etc. Still, companies need to collabo￾rate with each other on projects to compete in today’s business world. The advantages 
of outsourcing include cost reduction, quicker completion times, greater flexibility, 
and higher level of expertise. Disadvantages include coordination problems, loss of 
control, conflicts, security issues, and political fallout.
A number of proactive best practices have emerged among firms that have mastered 
the outsourcing process. These practices include establishing well-defined requirements 
and procedures and utilizing fair and incentive-laden contracts. Team-building sessions 
are held before the project begins in order to forge relationships between personnel 
from different organizations. Escalation guidelines for resolving conflicts are estab￾lished, as are provisions for process improvement and risk sharing. On highly critical 
work, arrangements are made so that key personnel work together, face to face. Joint 
assessments of how well people are collaborating are the norm during status report 
briefings. Finally, many companies are realizing the benefits of forming long-term alli￾ances with each other on projects. The ultimate goal is to work together as partners.
Effective negotiating skills are essential to working on projects as partners. People 
need to resolve differences at the lowest level possible in order to keep the project on 
track. Veteran project managers realize that negotiating is not a competitive game and 
work toward collaborative solutions to problems. They accomplish this by separating 
people from the problem, focusing on interests and not positions, inventing options for 
mutual gain, and relying on objective criteria whenever possible to resolve disagree￾ments. They also recognize the importance of developing a strong BATNA, which 
provides them with the leverage necessary to seek collaborative solutions.
Customer satisfaction is the litmus test for project success. Project managers need 
to take a proactive approach to manage customer expectations and perceptions. They 
need to actively involve customers in key decisions and keep them abreast of impor￾tant developments. Active customer involvement keeps the project team focused on 
the objectives of the project and reduces misunderstandings and dissatisfaction.

SNAPSHOT 
FROM PRACTICE
1. Break into groups of four or five students. Assign half of the groups the role of 
owner and the other half the role of contractor.
Owners: After saving for many years you are about to hire a contractor to build 
your “dream home.” What are your objectives for this project? What concerns or 
issues do you have about working with a general contractor to build your home?
Contractors: You specialize in building customized homes. You are about to meet 
with prospective owners to begin to negotiate a contract for building their “dream 
home.” What are your objectives for this project? What concerns or issues do you 
have about working with the owners to build their home?
Each owner group meets with a contractor group and shares their objectives, 
concerns, and issues.
Identify what objectives, issues, and concerns you have in common and which 
ones are unique. Discuss how you could work together to realize your objectives. 
What would be the keys to working as partners on this project?

 Case 12.1
Shell Case Fabricators
BACKGROUND
Shell Case Fabricators (SCF) designs and builds shell casings that enclose electronic 
products such as calculators, cell phones, and modems. Typically the cases are plas￾tic or plastic compounds. SCF has six different production lines that cover different 
types of products. For example, the largest high-volume production line for modems 
can produce three different colors and two models (vertical and flat). Air Connection 
Links (ACL) is the biggest customer that buys product from this line. This high-output 
line now runs at full capacity on an eight-hour shift. The other five lines run smaller 
quantities and tend to meet the needs of other specialty products manufactured by dif￾ferent, smaller firms.
Ninety-five percent of SCF’s product casings line is designed by the original hard￾ware manufacturer. Getting a casing to the production stage requires a great deal of 
collaboration and interaction between the original hardware and case design manufac￾turer (e.g., ACL) and SCF’s shell design engineers and Production Department. The 
latest new product of ACL is a modem designed to be used for monitoring water activ￾ity in bays, such as ship traffic, pollution, and floating debris. Because of the product’s 
high functionality and low cost, potential demand for the new product is out of sight. 
It seems every country with small bays used for shipping wants enough underwater 
modems to cover its respective bays.
THE UNDERWATER MODEM PROJECT
At SCF each new product is assigned a project manager to coordinate and manage 
the shell design, budgets, and manufacturing start-up. Songsee is SCF’s star project 
manager and is the project manager of the shell for the new short-range, underwater 
acoustical modem. The shell casing for the underwater modem required special design 
and materials, custom equipment, and a seal to withstand pressure to 50 meters. Air 
Connection Links, the product owner, needs 60,000 modems in 91 days (next Janu￾ary 15) for the Estuary Control Institute meeting in Hong Kong.
CLIENT CHANGE REQUEST
Songsee has felt the project was moving along smoothly, with the exception of 
being two weeks behind schedule. She feels she can “lean on” the Design Depart￾ment to put the project on top priority and make up the two weeks. Yesterday ACL’s 
project manager, Sabin, came in with a “simple change”: change the outer shell 
shape from rectangular to dome shape; it will improve performance by 2 percent. 
Songsee couldn’t believe Sabin. He knows better. He knows the engineering impli￾cations, and it is NOT simple! Yet Sabin tells Songsee, “It shouldn’t cost much.” 
Songsee imagined a sharp retort, but she counted to five and aborted. At this late 
stage of the game, changes and schedule compression cost big money! Songsee said 
she would get together with her team and start on a new time and cost estimate that 
day. She told Sabin he would have to give her a written change request of the new 
requirements by the next day. Sabin appeared disappointed: “Why don’t we just add 
€100,000 to the price and get on with it? We have been doing business with SCF

for six years. With expected demand out of sight, SCF will break even quickly and 
have a great profit on the production side.” Songsee sighed. “Let’s proceed with 
the change order process. I will take your request to the change order governance 
committee.”
Songsee’s meeting with her team about the change went about as expected. Every 
department moaned about changing at this late date. The guesstimate cost and time 
estimates were over triple Sabin’s idea of €100,000. For example, designing a new seal 
for a dome-style modem will require a new custom water sealing approach, possibly 
an untested different sealant, and new molds. Has ACL frozen the design of the new 
style modem? Songsee asked the team to come in with a more detailed estimate by 
tomorrow afternoon, before her meeting with the change order governance committee.
THE NEXT DAY (FRIDAY)
Sabin called from ACL at midmorning the next day: “Our senior management is 
upset that we have to be so formal for such a small change. They just want to get 
on with the project and meet the time-to-market launch date. €100,000 seems like a 
fair price. They believe you need to talk to your management. They want a response 
by Monday.”
The team estimates came close to yesterday’s guesstimate (€391,000)—not good 
news. Songsee knew the answer of the change committee would be to hold for the 
full amount. She was right. The change committee believed the costs are there and 
need to be covered to meet the launch date. The committee was also concerned that 
priorities and resource scheduling would have to change for SCF’s Design and Produc￾tion Departments. In three hours, she would meet with senior management to decide 
whether to accept the client’s request at their price or come up with an alternate plan. 
Songsee realized she should have several options for senior management to consider, 
along with a recommendation.
1. Should SCF accept or reject ACL’s request? Which option would you select? What 
risks are involved?
2. How should SCF negotiate with ACL? How can SCF and ACL develop a positive, 
long-range relationship? Give some specifics.
 Case 12.2
The Accounting Software Installation Project
Sitting in her office, Karin Chung is reviewing the past four months of the large cor￾porate accounting software installation project she has been managing. Everything 
seemed so well planned before the project started. Each company division had a task 
force that provided input into the proposed installation along with potential problems. 
Each of the divisions had been trained and briefed on exactly how that division would 
interface with and use the forthcoming accounting software. All six contractors, which 
included one of the Big Four consulting companies, assisted in developing the work 
breakdown structure—costs, specifications, and time.
Karin hired a consultant to conduct a one-day “partnering” workshop attended by 
the major accounting heads, a member of each task force group, and key represen￾tatives from each of the contractors. During the workshop, several different team￾building exercises were used to illustrate the importance of collaboration and effective 
Final PDF to printer474 Chapter 12 Outsourcing: Managing Interorganizational Relations
lar60886_ch12_445-484.indd 474 10/14/23 11:53 am
communication. Everyone laughed when Karin fell into an imaginary acid pit during 
a human bridge–building exercise. The workshop ended on an upbeat note with every￾one signing a partnering charter that expressed their commitment to working together 
as partners to complete the project.
TWO MONTHS LATER
One task force member came to Karin to complain that the contractor dealing with 
billing would not listen to his concerns about problems that could occur in the Virginia 
division when billings were consolidated. The contractor had told him, the task force 
member, he had bigger problems than consolidation of billing in the Virginia division. 
Karin replied, “You can settle the problem with the contractor. Go to him and explain 
how serious your problem is and that it will have to be settled before the project is 
completed.”
Later in the week in the lunchroom, she overheard one consulting contractor bad￾mouthing the work of another—“never on time, interface coding not tested.” In the 
hallway the same day an Accounting Department supervisor told her that tests showed 
the new software will never be compatible with the Georgia division’s accounting 
practices.
While concerned, Karin considered these problems typical of the kind she had 
encountered on other, smaller software projects.
FOUR MONTHS LATER
The project seemed to be falling apart. What had happened to the positive attitude fos￾tered at the team-building workshop? One contractor wrote a formal letter complain￾ing that another contractor was sitting on a coding decision that was delaying their 
work. “We cannot be held responsible or liable for delays caused by others.” The proj￾ect was already two months behind, so problems were becoming very serious. Karin 
finally decided to call a meeting of all parties to the project and partnering agreement.
She began by asking about problems people were encountering while working on 
the project. Although participants were reluctant to be first for fear of being perceived 
as a complainer, it was not long before accusations and tempers flared out of control. 
It was always some group complaining about another group. Several participants com￾plained that others were sitting on decisions that resulted in their work being held up. 
One consultant said, “It is impossible to tell who’s in charge of what.” Another partici￾pant complained that although the group met separately on small problems, it never 
met as a total group to assess new risk situations that developed.
Karin felt the meeting had degenerated into an unrecoverable situation. Commit￾ment to the project and partnering appeared to be waning. She quickly decided to stop 
the meeting and cool things down. She spoke to the project stakeholders: “It is clear 
that we have some serious problems and the project is in jeopardy. The project must 
get back on track, and the backbiting must stop. I want each of us to come to a meeting 
Friday morning with concrete suggestions of what it will take to get the project back 
on track and specific actions of how we can make it happen. We need to recognize our 
mutual interdependence and bring our relationships with each other back to a win/win 
environment. When we do get things back on track, we need to figure out how to stay 
on track.”
1. Why does this attempt at project partnering appear to be failing?
2. If you were Karin, what would you do to get this project back on track?

 Case 12.3
Buxton Hall
Chad Cromwell, head of university housing, gazed up at the tower at Buxton Hall 
and smiled as he walked toward the landmark building. Buxton Hall was built in 
1927 as a residential complex for over 350 students at Pacifica State University. 
At the time, Buxton was the tallest building on campus, and its tower had a pan￾oramic view of the athletic fields and coastal range. Buxton quickly became a focal 
point at Pacifica State. Students perched on the tower dominated the campus dur￾ing the annual spring water fight with their huge slingshots and catapults. The first 
intranet on the Pacific coast was created at Buxton that linked students’ computers 
and allowed them to share printers. Around the 1970s, some student artists began 
the tradition of painting their room doors. Whether a Rolling Stones logo or Bugs 
Bunny on a skateboard, these colorful doors were an artistic legacy that caught the 
attention of students and faculty.
Buxton Hall served as a residence hall for the university for many years, but time 
was not kind to the stately building. Leaks destroyed plaster in the interior. Wiring and 
plumbing became outdated and so dangerous that the building was deemed unsafe. 
Buxton Hall’s doors were closed to students and windows boarded up at the end of the 
2010 spring quarter. For 10 years Buxton sat silent and over time became a symbol of 
the general decline of Pacifica State. Now thanks to state bonds and generous contri￾butions, Buxton Hall was about to be reopened after a $20 million renovation.
18 MONTHS AGO
Chad and key representatives from university facilities were engaged in the sec￾ond of a two-day partnering workshop. Also in attendance were managers from 
Crawford Construction, the chief contractor for the Buxton renovation project, as 
well as several key subcontractors and architects from the firm of Legacy West. 
During the first day, a consultant ran them through a series of team-building and 
communication exercises that accentuated the importance of open communication, 
principle negotiation, and win/win thinking. The second day began with the “proj￾ect from hell” exercise, with each group describing the worst project they had ever 
worked on. Chad was surprised that the Crawford and Legacy West descriptions 
were very similar to his own. For example, each group talked about how frustrating 
it was when changes were made without proper consultation or costs were hidden 
until it was too late to do anything about them. This was followed by a discussion 
of the best project they had ever worked on. The consultant then asked the groups 
which of the two they wanted the Buxton project to be. A genuine sense of com￾mon purpose emerged, and everyone became actively engaged in spelling out in 
specific terms how they wanted to work together. The session concluded with all 
of the participants signing a partnering charter, followed by a picnic and a friendly 
softball game.
12 MONTHS AGO
Chad was on his way, with Nick Bolas, to meet Dat Nguyen, the Crawford project 
manager, on the third floor at Buxton Hall. Dat had contacted him to discuss a prob￾lem with the tile work in one of the communal bathrooms. Dat’s people had completed 
Final PDF to printer476 Chapter 12 Outsourcing: Managing Interorganizational Relations
lar60886_ch12_445-484.indd 476 10/14/23 11:53 am
the work, but Nick, who was a Pacifica facilities manager, refused to sign off on it, 
claiming that it was not up to spec. After a 24-hour impasse, the Crawford foreman 
exercised the escalation clause in the partnering agreement and passed the issue up 
to management’s level to be resolved. Dat and Chad inspected the work. While both 
agreed that the job could have been prettier, it did meet specifications, and Chad told 
Nick to sign off on it.
Chad met Dat again later in the day at the weekly Buxton status report meeting. 
The meeting kicked off with a brief review of what had been accomplished during the 
past week. Discussion centered on the removal of elm trees. Alternative strategies for 
dealing with the city inspector, who had a reputation for being a stickler for details, 
were considered. The project was two weeks behind schedule, which was an import￾ant issue, since it was imperative that the building be ready for students to move in at 
the 2025 fall term. The project was also on a very tight budget, and the management 
reserves had to be carefully administered. Renovation of existing buildings was always 
a bit of a gamble, since you never knew what you would find once you began tearing 
down walls. Fortunately, only small amounts of asbestos were found, but rot was much 
more severe than anticipated.
The meeting included a partnering assessment. The results of an online survey 
filled out by all the principals were distributed. The results revealed a dip in the ratings 
between the Crawford foremen and university officials regarding timely collaboration 
and effective problem solving. One of Chad’s people said that the primary source of 
frustration was Crawford foremen failing to respond to email and telephone messages. 
Dat asked for the names of his people and said he would talk to each of them. The 
Crawford foremen complained that the university officials were being too nit-picky. 
“We don’t have the time or money to do A+ work on everything,” argued a foreman. 
Chad told Dat and his people that he would talk to the facilities workers and ask them 
to focus on what was really important.
6 MONTHS AGO
The project status report meeting started on time. Crawford had been able to make 
up for lost time, and it now looked like the building would open on time. Chad was 
glad to see that the partnering assessment had been positive and steady over the past 
month. The big issue was the surge in costs consuming all but $90,000 of manage￾ment reserves. With six months to go, everyone knew that this would not cover all the 
change orders needed to have the building ready. After all, there was already $54,000 
worth of change orders pending.
Chad looked across the table and saw nothing but grim faces. Then one of the 
Crawford foremen proposed postponing treating all of the exterior walls: “Instead of 
cleaning and preserving the entire brick building, let’s only do the front entrance and 
the north and south walls that the public sees. We can just refurbish the interior court 
walls as well as the west side. This would be adequate for at least eight years, in which 
time money should be available to complete the job.”
At first Chad didn’t like this idea, but eventually, he realized that this was the only 
way they could have the building ready for the students. Friendly arguments broke out 
over which exterior segments needed the full treatment and which ones didn’t. The 
whole team ended up touring the outside of the building, identifying what kind of 
work needed to be done. In the end, only 70 percent of the exterior brick walls were 
reconditioned according to plan, with savings of over $450,000. While this boost to 
the reserve would still make things tight, everyone felt that they now had a fighting 
chance to complete the project on time.

TODAY
As Chad mingled, with a glass of champagne, no one talked about the walls that still 
needed to be refurbished—tonight was a night to celebrate. All of the major partici￾pants and their spouses were at the party, and the university was hosting a five-course 
meal at the top of the tower. During the toasts, jokes were exchanged and stories were 
told about the ghosts in the west wing and the discovery of a dead skunk in the south 
basement. Everyone talked about how proud he or she felt about bringing the grand 
old building back to life. More than one person mentioned that this was much more 
satisfying than tearing down an old relic and constructing a new building. The presi￾dent of the university concluded the festivities by thanking everyone for all the hard 
work and proclaiming that Buxton would become a bright, shining icon for Pacifica 
State.

 Case 12.5
Umdanso Project
Hannah just tried calling her supplier in Guangzhou for the third time and still no 
response. Hannah is the assistant project manager working on the Umdanso project for 
the Apollo electronics firm. Apollo is a small, high-end boutique developer and manu￾facturer of stereo music electronics. The Umdanso project is named after the Zulu 
word for Dance. The project objective is to create the next-generation analog/digital 
conversion device that allows users to listen to high-fidelity music from their vinyl 
record players through their wireless music system. The popularity of vinyl record 
sales and the growing segment market of audiophiles with disposable income has led 
to a boom in Apollo’s business and Umdanso is seen as a flagship product.
The project progressed successfully to the prototype stage. So far the tests have 
exceeded expectations, and everyone was excited to hear the prototype. The Umdanso 
device relied on two chip suppliers from mainland China. One was in Shenzhen and 
the other was in Guangzhou.
Hannah has a long-distance working relationship with her counterparts in Shenzhen. 
They had been supplying Apollo with chips from the beginning. While there were some 
communication problems early on, over time they had been resolved, and both firms 
seemed pleased with working arrangement. In fact, Stoffel Theron, the CEO of Apollo, 
hosted the Shenzhen VP of operations and his family at his ranch last summer.
The chip supplier in Guangzhou was a different story. This was a new contract. The 
firm was a new manufacturer and was chosen based on price. Hannah had a virtual 
meeting via Zoom with her Guangzhou counterparts, and they appeared stiff but com￾petent. That was until the COVID-19 virus struck China and government restrictions 
began to be put into place.
Hannah woke up early that morning with the news that the Chinese government was 
considering travel restrictions in face of the COVID-19 virus threat. Hannah first called 
Shenzhen. Shenzhen confirmed her fears that this was going to be a long-term prob￾lem. The Shenzhen manager assured her that they would expedite shipping the chips to 
Apollo. Hannah checked her email and tried calling Guangzhou again with no response.

Since most outsourced work on projects is contractual, this appendix discusses the 
different kinds of contracts that are used, their strengths and weaknesses, and how 
contracts shape the motives and expectations of different participants. Contract man￾agement is a key element of any project procurement management system. It is beyond 
the scope of this book to describe this system. However, the basic processes are listed 
here to put contract management and related topics like Request for Proposal (RFP) in 
perspective. Procurement management consists of six main steps:
∙ Planning purchases and acquisitions involves determining what to procure, when, 
and how. This entails the classic build-versus-buy analysis as well as determination 
of the type of contract to use.
∙ Planning contracting involves describing the requirements for products or ser￾vices desired from outsourcing and identifying potential suppliers or sellers. Out￾puts include procurement documents such as an RFP as well as selection criteria.
∙ Requesting seller responses involves obtaining information, quotes, bids, or pro￾posals from sellers and providers. The main outputs of this process include a quali￾fied sellers list and specific proposals.
∙ Selecting sellers involves choosing from potential suppliers through a process of 
evaluating potential providers and negotiating a contract.
∙ Administering the contract involves managing the relationship with the selected 
seller or provider.
∙ Closing the contract involves completion and settlement of the contract.
Most companies have Purchasing Departments that specialize in procurement. 
Often purchasing agents will be assigned to project teams and they work with other 
team members to come up with optimum solutions for the project. Even if project 
teams are not directly involved in contract negotiations and the decision to outsource 
project work, it is important that the team understand the procurement process and the 
nature of different kinds of contracts.
CONTRACTS
A contract is a formal agreement between two parties wherein one party (the contrac￾tor) obligates itself to perform a service and the other party (the client) obligates itself 
to do something in return, usually in the form of a payment to the contractor. For 
example, an insurance firm contracted with a consulting firm to reprogram segments 
of their information system to conform to the latest operating system.
A contract is more than just an agreement between parties. A contract is a codification 
of the private law, which governs the relationship between the parties to it. It defines the 
responsibilities, spells out the conditions of its operations, defines the rights of the parties 
in relationship to each other, and grants remedies to a party if the other party breaches its 
obligations. A contract attempts to spell out in specific terms the transactional obligations 
of the parties involved as well as contingencies associated with the execution of the con￾tract. An ambiguous or inconsistent contract is difficult to understand and enforce.
There are essentially two kinds of contracts. The first is the “fixed-price” contract, 
in which a price is agreed upon in advance and remains fixed as long as there are no 
changes to the scope or provisions of the agreement. The second is a “cost-plus” con￾tract, in which the contractor is reimbursed for all or some of the expenses incurred 
during the performance of the contract. Unlike in a fixed-price contract, the final price 
is not known until the project is completed. Within these two types of contracts, sev￾eral variations exist.

FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS
Under a fixed-price (FP), or lump-sum, agreement, the contractor agrees to perform all 
work specified in the contract at a fixed price. Clients are able to get a minimum price 
by putting out the contract to competitive bid. Advertising an invitation for bid (IFB) that 
lists customer requirements usually results in low bids. Prospective contractors can obtain 
IFB notices through various channels. In the case of large business organizations and 
government agencies, potential contractors can request to be included on the bidder’s list 
in the area of interest. In other cases, IFBs can be found by scanning appropriate industry 
media such as newspapers, trade journals, and websites. In many cases, the owner can put 
restrictions on potential bidders, such as requiring that they be ISO 9000 certified.
With fixed-price contract bids, the contractor has to be very careful in estimating 
target cost and completion schedule because once agreed upon, the price cannot be 
adjusted. If contractors overestimate the target cost in the bidding stage, they may lose 
the contract to a lower-priced competitor; if the estimate is too low, they may win the 
job but make little or no profit.
Fixed-price contracts are preferred by both owners and contractors when the scope 
of the project is well defined with predictable costs and low implementation risks. 
Such might be the case for producing parts or components to specifications, executing 
training programs, or orchestrating a banquet. With fixed-price contracts, clients do 
not have to be concerned with project costs and can focus on monitoring work prog￾ress and performance specifications. Likewise, contractors prefer fixed-price contracts 
because the client is less likely to request changes or additions to the contract. Fewer 
potential changes reduce project uncertainty and allow the contractors to more effi￾ciently manage their resources across multiple projects.
The disadvantage of a fixed-price contract for owners is that it is more difficult and 
more costly to prepare. To be effective, design specifications need to be spelled out in 
sufficient detail to leave little doubt as to what is to be achieved. Because the contrac￾tor’s profit is determined by the difference between the bid and the actual costs, there 
is some incentive for contractors to use cheaper-quality materials, perform marginal 
workmanship, or extend the completion date to reduce costs. The client can counteract 
these by stipulating rigid end-item specifications and completion date and by supervis￾ing work. In many cases, the client will hire a consultant who is an expert in the field 
to oversee the contractor’s work and protect the client’s interest.
The primary disadvantage of a fixed-price contract for contractors is that they run 
the risk of underestimating. If the project gets into serious trouble, cost overruns may 
make the project unprofitable and, in some cases, may lead to bankruptcy. To avoid 
this, contractors have to invest significant time and money to ensure that their esti￾mates are accurate.
Contracts with long lead times such as construction and production projects may 
include escalation provisions that protect the contractor against external cost increases 
in materials, labor rates, or overhead expenses. For example, the price may be tied to an 
inflation index, so it can be adjusted to sudden increases in labor and material prices, or 
it may be redetermined as costs become known. A variety of redetermination contracts 
are used. Some establish a ceiling price for a contract and permit only downward adjust￾ments; others permit upward and downward adjustments. Some establish one readjust￾ment period at the end of the project; others use more than one period. Redetermination 
contracts are appropriate where engineering and design efforts are difficult to estimate or 
when final price cannot be estimated for lack of accurate cost data.
While, in principle, redetermination contracts are used to make appropriate adjust￾ments in cost uncertainties, they are prone to abuse. A contractor may win an initial 
Final PDF to printer482 Chapter 12 Outsourcing: Managing Interorganizational Relations
lar60886_ch12_445-484.indd 482 10/14/23 11:53 am
low bid contract, initiate the contracted work, and then “discover” that the costs are 
much higher than expected. The contractor can take advantage of redetermination pro￾visions and a client’s ignorance to justify increasing the actual cost of the contract. The 
contract evolves into a cost-plus contract.
To alleviate some of the disadvantages of a fixed-price contract while maintaining 
some certainty as to final cost, many fixed-price contracts contain incentive clauses 
designed to motivate contractors to reduce costs and improve efficiency. For example, 
a contractor negotiates to perform the work for a target price based on a target cost and 
a target profit. A maximum price and maximum profit are also established. If the total 
cost ends up being less than the target cost, the contractor makes a higher profit up 
to the profit maximum. If there is a cost overrun, the contractor absorbs some of the 
overrun until a profit floor is reached.
Profit is determined according to a formula based on a cost-sharing ratio (CSR). A 
CSR of 75/25, for example, indicates that for every dollar spent above target costs, the cli￾ent pays 75 cents and the contractor pays 25 cents. This provision motivates contractors to 
keep costs low, since they pay 25 cents on every dollar spent above the expected cost and 
earn 25 cents more on every dollar saved below the expected cost. Fixed-price incentive 
contracts tend to be used for long-duration projects with fairly predictable cost estimates. 
The key is being able to negotiate a reasonable target cost estimate. Unscrupulous contrac￾tors have been known to take advantage of the ignorance of the client to negotiate an unre￾alistically high target cost and use performance incentives to achieve excessive profits.
COST-PLUS CONTRACTS
Under a cost-plus contract the contractor is reimbursed for all direct allowable costs 
(materials, labor, travel) plus an additional fee to cover overhead and profit. This fee is 
negotiated in advance and usually involves a percentage of the total costs. On small proj￾ects this kind of contract comes under the rubric “time and materials contract,” in which 
the client agrees to reimburse the contractor for labor cost and materials. Labor costs are 
based on an hourly or daily rate, which includes direct and indirect costs as well as profit. 
The contractor is responsible for documenting labor and materials costs.
Unlike fixed-price contracts, cost-plus contracts put the burden of risk on the cli￾ent. The contract does not indicate what the project is going to cost until the end of the 
project. Contractors are supposed to make the best effort to fulfill the specific techni￾cal requirements of the contract but cannot be held liable, in spite of their best efforts, 
if the work is not produced within the estimated cost and time frame. These contracts 
are often criticized because there is little formal incentive for the contractors to control 
costs or finish on time because they get paid regardless of the final cost. The major 
factor motivating contractors to control costs and schedule is the effect overruns have 
on their reputation and their ability to secure future business.
The inherent weakness of cost-plus contracts has been compensated for by a variety 
of incentive clauses directed at providing incentives to contractors to control costs, main￾tain performance, and avoid schedule overruns. Contractors are reimbursed for costs, but 
instead of the fee being fixed, it is based on an incentive formula and subject to additional 
provisions. This is very similar to fixed-price incentive contracts, but instead of being 
based on a target cost, the fee is based on actual cost, using a cost-sharing formula.
Most contracts are concerned with the negotiated cost of the project. However, given 
the importance of speed and timing in today’s business world, more and more contracts 
involve clauses concerning completion dates. To some extent, schedule incentives provide 
some cost-control measures because schedule slippage typically, but not always, involves 
cost overruns. Schedule incentives/penalties are stipulated depending on the significance

lar60886_ch12_445-484.indd 483 10/14/23 11:53 am
of time to completion for the owner. For example, the contract involving the construction 
of a new baseball stadium is likely to contain stiff penalties if the stadium is not ready 
for opening day of the season. Conversely, time-constrained projects in which the num￾ber one priority is getting the project completed as soon as possible are likely to include 
attractive incentives for completing the project early.
A good example of this can be seen in Snapshot from Practice 9.2: Responding to 
the Northridge Earthquake, in which the construction firm pulled out all the stops to 
restore the damaged highway system 74 days ahead of schedule. The firm received a 
$14.8 million bonus for these efforts!
Figure A12.1 summarizes the spectrum of risk to the buyer and supplier for dif￾ferent kinds of contracts. Buyers have the lowest risk with firm fixed-price contracts 
because they know exactly what they will need to pay the supplier. Buyers have the 
most risk with cost-plus percentage of cost contracts because they do not know in 
advance what the suppliers’ costs will be and suppliers may be motivated to increase 
costs. From the suppliers’ perspective, the cost-plus contract offers the least risk and 
the firm fixed-price contract entails the most risk.
CONTRACT CHANGE CONTROL SYSTEM
A contract change control system defines the process by which the contract may be 
modified. It includes the paperwork, tracking systems, dispute resolution procedures, 
and approval levels necessary for authorizing changes. There are a number of reasons 
a contract may need to be changed. Clients may wish to alter the original design or 
scope of the project once the project is initiated. This is quite common as the project 
moves from concept to reality. For example, an owner may wish to add windows after 
inspecting the partially completed homesite. Market changes may dictate adding new 
features or increasing the performance requirements of equipment. Declining financial 
resources may dictate that the owner cut back on the scope of the project. The contrac￾tor may initiate changes in the contract in response to unforeseen legitimate problems. 
A building contractor may need to renegotiate the contract in the face of excessive 
groundwater or the lack of availability of specified materials. In some cases, external 
forces may dictate contract changes, such as a need to comply with new safety stan￾dards mandated by the federal government.
There need to be formal, agreed-upon procedures for initiating changes in the origi￾nal contract. Contract change orders are subject to abuse. Contractors sometimes take

advantage of owners’ ignorance to inflate the costs of changes to recoup profit lost 
from a low bid. Conversely, owners have been known to “get back” at contractors by 
delaying approval of contract changes, thus delaying project work and increasing the 
costs to the contractor. All parties need to agree, in advance, on the rules and proce￾dures for initiating and making changes to the original terms of the contract.
CONTRACT MANAGEMENT IN PERSPECTIVE
Contract management is not an exact science. For decades the federal government has 
been trying to develop a more effective contract administration system. Despite their 
best efforts, abuses are repeatedly exposed in the news media. The situation is similar 
to trying to take a wrinkle out of an Oriental rug. Efforts to eliminate a wrinkle in one 
part of the rug invariably create a wrinkle in another part. Likewise, each new revision 
in government procurement procedures appears to generate a new loophole that can be 
exploited. There is no perfect contract management system. Given the inherent uncer￾tainty involved in most project work, no contract can handle all the issues that emerge. 
Formal contracts cannot replace or eliminate the need to develop effective working 
relationships between the parties involved that are based on mutual goals, trust, and 
cooperation. For this reason, the earlier discussion of best practices in outsourcing and 
effective negotiating is very important.
APPENDIX REVIEW QUESTIONS

How does a project get one year late?
. . . One day at a time.
—Frederick P. Brooks, The Mythical Man-Month, p. 153
Nothing ever goes completely according to plan. Once a project is launched, manage￾ment needs an information and control system to make adjustments and steer the proj￾ect toward its objectives. On time-sensitive projects, project managers need to be able 
to track progress and know when to speed things up. On set budget projects, project 
managers need to be able to monitor costs and know when it is necessary to cut costs. 
Not only are you interested in whether the project is on schedule and budget, but man￾agement and customers want to know when the project is likely to be completed and 
at what cost.
This chapter begins by describing the structure and process of project control sys￾tems. Indicators used to assess meeting schedule are discussed next, followed by an 
introduction to earned value management (EVM). Earned value is a key concept. It 
will be used both to assess current performance and to predict final costs and comple￾tion dates. Be forewarned this is not an easy chapter. Measuring progress can seem 
complicated quickly and you may find yourself overwhelmed by terminology and 
indices. However, if you master these concepts, you will have a distinct advantage.
13.1 Structure of a Project Monitoring Information System
A project monitoring system involves determining what data to collect; how, when,
and who will collect the data; analysis of the data; and reporting current progress.
What Data Are Collected?
Data collected are determined by which metrics will be used for project control. Typi￾cal key data collected are actual activity duration times, resource usage and rates, and 
actual costs, which are compared against planned times, resources, and budgets. Since

a major portion of the monitoring system focuses on cost/schedule concerns, it is cru￾cial to provide the project manager and stakeholders with data to answer questions 
such as
∙ What is the current status of the project in terms of schedule and cost?
∙ How much will it cost to complete the project?
∙ When will the project be completed?
∙ Are there potential problems that need to be addressed now?
∙ What, who, and where are the causes for cost or schedule overruns?
∙ If there is a cost overrun midway in the project, can we forecast the overrun at 
completion?
The performance metrics you need to collect should support answering these ques￾tions. Examples of specific metrics and tools for collecting data will be discussed in 
detail later in this chapter.
Collecting Data and Analysis
With the determination of what data are collected, the next step is to establish who, 
when, and how the data will be assembled. Will the data be collected by the project 
team, contractor, independent cost engineers, and project manager? Or will the data be 
derived electronically from some form of surrogate data such as cash flow, machine 
hours, labor hours, or materials in place? Should the reporting period be one hour, 
one day, one week, or what? Is there a central repository for the data collected and is 
someone responsible for its dissemination?
Electronic means of collecting data have vastly improved data assembly, analysis, 
and dissemination. Numerous software vendors have programs and tools to analyze 
customized collected data and present it in a form that facilitates monitoring the proj￾ect, identifying sources of problems, and updating the plan.
Reports and Reporting
First, who gets the progress reports? We have already suggested that different stake￾holders and levels of management need different kinds of project information. Senior 
management’s major interests are usually “Are we on time and within budget? If not, 
what corrective action is taking place?” Likewise, IT managers working on the proj￾ect are concerned primarily about their deliverable and specific work packages. The 
reports should be designed for the right audience.
Typically project progress reports are designed and communicated in written or 
oral form. A common topic format for progress reports follows:
∙ Progress since last report
∙ Current status of project
1. Schedule
2. Cost
3. Scope
∙ Cumulative trends
∙ Problems and issues since last report
1. Actions and resolution of earlier problems
2. New variances and problems identified
∙ Corrective action planned

Given the structure of your information system and the nature of its outputs, you 
can use the system to interface and facilitate the project control process. These inter￾faces need to be relevant and seamless if control is to be effective.
13.2 The Project Control Process
Control is the process of comparing actual performance against the plan to identify 
deviations, evaluate possible alternative courses of actions, and take appropriate cor￾rective action. The project control steps for measuring and evaluating project perfor￾mance are
1. Setting a baseline plan.
2. Measuring progress and performance.
3. Comparing plan against actual.
4. Taking action.
Each of the control steps is described in the following paragraphs.
Step 1: Setting a Baseline Plan
The baseline plan provides the elements for measuring performance. The baseline is 
derived from the cost and duration information found in the work breakdown structure 
(WBS) database and time-sequence data from the network and resource scheduling 
decisions. From the WBS the project resource schedule is used to time-phase all work, 
resources, and budgets into a baseline plan. See Chapter 8.
Step 2: Measuring Progress and Performance
Time and budgets are quantitative measures of performance that readily fit into the 
integrated information system. Qualitative measures such as meeting customer tech￾nical specifications and product function are most frequently determined by on-site 
inspection or actual use. This chapter is limited to quantitative measures of time and 
budget. Measurement of time performance is relatively easy and obvious. That is, is 
the critical path early, on schedule, or late; is the slack of near-critical paths decreasing 
to cause new critical activities? Measuring performance against budget (e.g., money, 
units in place, labor hours) is more difficult and is not simply a case of comparing 
actual versus budget. Earned value is necessary to provide a realistic estimate of per￾formance against a time-phased budget. Earned value (EV) is the budgeted cost of 
the work performed.
Step 3: Comparing Plan against Actual
Because plans seldom materialize as expected, it becomes imperative to measure devia￾tions from plan to determine if action is necessary. Periodic monitoring and measur￾ing the status of the project allow for comparisons of actual versus expected plans. It is 
important that the timing of status reports be frequent enough to allow for early detection 
of variations from plan and early correction of causes. Usually, status reports should take 
place every one to four weeks to be useful and allow for proactive correction.
Step 4: Taking Action
If deviations from plans are significant, corrective action will be needed to bring the 
project back in line with the original or revised plan. For example, if the project is

behind schedule, overtime may be authorized to get back on schedule. In some cases, 
conditions or scope can change, which in turn will require a change in the baseline 
plan to recognize new information.
The remainder of this chapter describes and illustrates monitoring systems, tools, 
and components to support managing and controlling projects. Several of the tools you 
developed in the planning and scheduling chapters now serve as input to your informa￾tion system for monitoring performance. Monitoring time performance is discussed 
first, followed by cost performance.
13.3 Monitoring Time Performance
A major goal of progress reporting is to catch any negative variances from plan as 
early as possible to determine if corrective action is necessary. Fortunately, monitoring 
schedule performance is relatively easy. The project network schedule, derived from 
the WBS/OBS, serves as the baseline to compare against actual performance.
Gantt charts (bar charts), control charts, and milestone schedules are the typical 
tools used for communicating project schedule status. As suggested in Chapter 6, the 
Gantt chart is the most favored, used, and understandable. This kind of chart is com￾monly referred to as a tracking Gantt chart. Adding actual and revised time estimates 
to the Gantt chart gives a quick overview of project status on the report date.
Tracking Gantt Chart
Figure 13.1 presents a baseline Gantt chart and a tracking Gantt chart for a project 
at the end of period 6. The solid bar below the original schedule bar represents the 
actual start and finish times for completed activities or any portion of an activity 
completed (see activities A, B, C, D, and E). For example, the actual start time for 
activity C is period 2; the actual finish time is period 5; the actual duration is three 
time units, rather than four scheduled time periods. Activities in process show the 
actual start time; the extended bar represents the expected remaining duration (see 
activities D and E). The remaining duration for activities D and E is shown with 
the hatched bar. Activity F, which has not started, shows a revised estimated actual 
start (9) and finish time (13).
Note how activities can have durations that differ from the original schedule, as in 
activities C, D, and E. Either the activity is complete and the actual is known, or new 
information suggests the estimate of time be revised and reflected in the status report. 
Activity D’s revised duration results in an expected delay in the start of activity F. 
The project is now estimated to be completed one period later than planned. Although 
sometimes the Gantt chart does not show dependencies, when it is used with a net￾work, the dependencies are easily identified if tracing is needed.
Control Chart
A control chart is another tool used to monitor past project schedule performance and 
current performance and to estimate future schedule trends. Figure 13.2 depicts a proj￾ect control chart. The chart is used to plot the difference between the scheduled and 
actual times on the critical path at a given point on the project. Although Figure 13.2 
shows the project was behind early in the project, the plot suggests corrective action 
brought the project back on track. If the trend is sustained, the project will come in 
ahead of schedule. Because the activity scheduled times represent average durations,

four observations trending in one direction indicate there is a very high probability 
that there is an identifiable cause. The cause should be located and action taken if 
necessary. Control chart trends are very useful for warning of potential problems so 
appropriate action can be taken if necessary.

13.4 Earned Value Management (EVM)
The Need for Earned Value Management
Earned value management (EVM) is a methodology that combines scope, sched￾ule, and resource measurements to assess project performance and progress. To 
understand the value of EVM, imagine you are a project manager for a large paint￾ing company that has secured the contract with a local developer to paint 10 identi￾cal condos. It is estimated that it will take your team 2 weeks to paint each condo 
at a cost of $10,000. You expect to complete the project in 20 weeks at a total cost 
of $100,000.
After 10 weeks management asks for a status report. You report you have spent 
$50,000. Management might conclude the following: good, you spent as much as you 
were supposed to spend, and everything is going according to plan. This might be cor￾rect, but it might not be. It is also possible that after 10 weeks due to unusually warm 
weather you were able to paint 6 condos at a cost of only $50,000. Conversely, due to 
inclement weather you may have been able to paint only 4 condos at a cost of $50,000. 
What is true?

Milestone Schedule, 
Planned, and Actual
Milestone Schedules
Milestone schedules are often used to keep more distal stakeholders informed on the 
progress of a project. Such stakeholders, whether it is senior management, the owner, 
or regulatory agencies, often neither need nor desire a detailed accounting of project 
progress. Instead, their interests can be satisfied by reporting progress toward major 
project milestones. Remember from Chapter 4 that milestones are significant project 
events that mark major accomplishments. Table 13.1 is the milestone schedule used to 
keep the president of a university and his/her cabinet informed on the construction of 
a new College of Business building.
Project managers recognize the need to use a more macro schedule of significant 
deliverables to keep external stakeholders informed and a more detailed milestone￾driven schedule to manage and motivate the project team to achieve those deliv￾erables. For more on the latter, see Snapshot from Practice 13.1: Guidelines for 
Setting Milestones.

In medieval times, mounds of stones 
were used to mark the distance trav￾eled along a path or road. Travelers 
used these rock formations to gauge 
their progress and adjust their plans. 
In modern times, milestones are distinct events along 
the project timeline that are used to gauge progress 
and adjust plans. Milestones are building blocks for the 
project’s schedule and often create positive momen￾tum to propel the project along to completion. To be 
effective, milestones need to be concrete, specific, 
measurable events.
Here are some guidelines for setting milestones 
gleaned from conversations with veteran project 
managers: 
Avoid the temptation to overuse milestones as a 
motivational tool by labeling every task a milestone. 
Only important deliverables or achievements should 
be used as milestones.
Timing of milestones is important. Milestones that 
are placed too far apart will not generate momentum. 
Conversely, milestones placed too close together 
quickly lose their distinctiveness.
Critical merge and burst activities are often use￾ful milestones, since they indicate significant work 
has been or is about to be accomplished. Here it is 
important to remember that milestones are events, 
not tasks, and the start of a merge activity (e.g., pat￾ent application submitted) or the completion of a 
burst activity (e.g., building permit approved) should 
be used.
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 13.1 Guidelines for Setting Milestones
Significant accomplishments are always good mile￾stones and are opportunities to celebrate progress. 
Completion of the roof on construction projects is 
typically celebrated across the world. Note this is 
most likely a burst activity.
Rates of completion can be used on projects involv￾ing repetition and not sequential advancement. For 
example, on a training project, milestones could be 
set as percentages of employees fully trained and 
certified, such as 25 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent, 
and 100 percent.
Completing a high-anxiety, high-risk task is always 
worthy of milestone consideration. For example, 
gaining foreign approval or completing dangerous 
work like transporting volatile chemicals or crossing a 
treacherous part of mountain trek.
Judicious use of milestones helps motivate and keep 
the project team focused.
Erik Larson
From this example, it is easy to understand why using only actual and planned costs 
can mislead management and customers in evaluating project performance. Cost vari￾ance of budget-to-actual alone is inadequate. It does not measure how much work was 
accomplished for the money spent.
Enter the concept of earned value (EV). Earned value is the budgeted cost of the 
work you have actually accomplished to date. Let’s return to the previous examples 
and include EV in the analysis.
Management thank you for cost information but want to know how much work has 
been accomplished. You survey the work site and report that 4½ condos have been 
painted. According to the budget, 4½ condos should have cost $45,000. You earn the 
value of the work that has been completed.
Earned value for the first 10 weeks is $45,000.
Actual costs for the first 10 weeks are $50,000.
Planned budget costs for the first 10 weeks are $50,000.

lar60886_ch13_485-542.indd 493 10/14/23 11:56 am
We can now infer with confidence that the project is (1) behind schedule—we have 
accomplished $5,000 (one-half a condo) less than planned and (2) overbudget—we 
spent $50,000 to accomplish $45,000 worth of work.
Now let’s assume you survey the site and instead of finding 4½ condos painted, you 
are happy to report that 6 have been painted. You earn the value of the work that has 
been accomplished (6 × $10,000) = $60,000. Now you can report that the project is 
both (1) ahead of schedule—we have accomplished $10,000 (one condo) worth of 
work more than planned and (2) under budget—we were able to paint 6 condos for 
only $50,000 instead of the estimated $60,000.
Earned value is not new. The original earned value cost/schedule system was pio￾neered by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) in the 1960s. Cost overruns and 
public outcry motivated the DoD to search for a more effective system to track sched￾ule and cost in large project contracts. The private sector was quick to recognize the 
worth of EVM. It is probably safe to say project managers in every major country 
are using some form of EVM. It is not limited to construction or contracts. EVM is 
being used on internal projects in the manufacturing, pharmaceutical, and high-tech 
industries. For example, organizations such as EDS, NCR, Levi Strauss, Tektronics, 
and Disney have used earned value systems to track projects. More recently one of 
the authors used his expertise in EVM to help the College of Oceanography (CoO) 
at Oregon State University secure a multimillion-dollar National Science Founda￾tion (NSF) grant to design and build the next generation of off-shore research ves￾sels. This was the first time CoO encountered an NSF grant application that required 
an EVM system.
The earned value system starts with the time-phased costs that provide the project 
budget baseline, which is called the planned budgeted value of the work scheduled 
(PV). Given this time-phased baseline, comparisons can be made with actual and 
planned schedule and costs using a concept called earned value. The earned value 
system uses data developed from the work breakdown structure, project network, 
and schedule. This integrated cost/schedule system provides schedule and cost vari￾ance and can be used to forecast the remaining costs for the in-process project. The 
earned value approach provides the missing links not found in conventional cost￾budget systems. At any point in time, a status report can be developed for the proj￾ect. The development of an integrated cost/schedule system is discussed next.
EVM uses several acronyms and equations for analysis. Table 13.2 presents a 
glossary of these acronyms. You will need this glossary as a reference. In recent 
years acronyms have been shortened to be more phonetically friendly. This move￾ment is reflected in material from the Project Management Institute, in project man￾agement software, and by most practitioners. This text edition follows the recent 
trend. The acronyms found in brackets represent the older acronyms, which are often 
found in software programs. To the uninitiated, the terms used in practice appear 
horrendous and intimidating. However, once a few basic terms are understood, the 
intimidation index will evaporate.
Carefully following five steps ensures that the cost/schedule system is integrated. 
These steps are outlined here. Steps 1, 2, and 3 are accomplished in the planning stage. 
Steps 4 and 5 are sequentially accomplished during the execution stage of the project.
1. Define the work using a WBS/OBS. This step involves developing documents that 
include the following information (see Chapters 4 and 5):
a. Scope.
b. Work packages.
c. Deliverables.
Final PDF to printer494 Chapter 13 Progress and Performance Measurement and Evaluation
lar60886_ch13_485-542.indd 494 10/14/23 11:56 am
d. Organization units.
e. Resources.
f. Budgets for each work package.
2. Develop work and resource schedule.
a. Schedule resources to activities (see Chapter 8).
b. Time-phase work packages into a network.
3. Develop a time-phased budget using work packages included in an activity. The 
cumulative values of these budgets will become the baseline and will be called the 
planned budgeted cost of the work scheduled (PV). The sum should equal the bud￾geted amounts for all the work packages in the cost accounts (see Chapter 8).
4. At the work package level, collect the actual costs for the work performed. These 
costs will be called the actual cost of the work completed (AC). Collect percent 
complete and multiply this times the original budget amount for the value of the 
work actually completed. These values will be called earned value (EV).
5. Compute the schedule variance (SV) (SV = EV − PV) and cost variance (CV)
(CV = EV − AC). Prepare hierarchical status reports for each level of 
management—from work package manager to customer or project manager. The 
reports should also include project rollups by organization unit and deliverables. 
In addition, actual time performance should be checked against the project net￾work schedule.

which includes the techniques and systems presented in earlier chapters. Those who 
have tenaciously labored through the early chapters can smile! Steps 1 and 2 are 
already carefully developed. Observe that control data can be traced backward to spe￾cific deliverables and organization unit responsible.
The major reasons for creating a baseline are to monitor and report progress and 
to estimate cash flow. Therefore, it is crucial to integrate the baseline with the perfor￾mance measurement system. Costs are placed (time-phased) in the baseline exactly as 
managers expect them to be “earned.” This approach facilitates tracking costs to their 
EV Earned value for a task is the budgeted value of the work accomplished. Work accomplished is 
often measured in terms of percentages (e.g., 25% complete) in which case, EV is simply percent 
complete times its original budget. [The older acronym for this value was BCWP—budgeted cost of 
the work performed.]
PV The planned time-phased baseline of the value of the work scheduled. An approved cost estimate 
of the resources scheduled in a time-phased cumulative baseline [BCWS—budgeted cost of the 
work scheduled].
AC Actual cost of the work completed. The sum of the costs incurred in accomplishing work 
[ACWP—actual cost of the work performed].
CV Cost variance is the difference between the earned value and the actual costs for the work com￾pleted to date where CV = EV − AC.
SV Schedule variance is the difference between the earned value and the baseline to date where 
SV = EV − PV.
BAC Budgeted cost at completion. The total budgeted cost of the baseline or project cost accounts.
EAC Estimated cost at completion
ETC Estimated cost to complete remaining work
VAC Cost variance at completion. VAC indicates expected actual over- or underrun cost at completion.

point of origin. In practice, the integration is accomplished by using the same rules in 
assigning costs to the baseline as those used to measure progress using earned value. 
You may find several rules in practice, but percent complete is the workhorse most 
commonly used. Someone familiar with each task estimates what percent of the task 
has been completed or how much of the task remains.
Percent Complete Rule
This rule is the heart of any earned value system. The best method for assigning 
costs to the baseline under this rule is to establish frequent checkpoints over the 
duration of the work package and assign completion percentages in dollar terms. For 
example, units completed could be used to assign baseline costs and later to mea￾sure progress. Units might be lines of code, hours, drawings completed, cubic yards 
of concrete in place, workdays, prototypes complete, and so on. This approach to 
percent complete adds “objectivity” to the subjective observation approaches often 
used. When measuring percent complete in the monitoring phase of the project, it 
is common to limit the amount earned to 80 or 90 percent until the work package is 
100 percent complete.
What Costs Are Included in Baselines?
The baseline (PV) is the sum of the cost accounts, and each cost account is the sum 
of the work packages in the cost account. Three direct costs are typically included 
in baselines—labor, equipment, and materials—because these are direct costs the 
project manager can control. Overhead costs and profit are typically added later by 
accounting processes. Most work packages should be discrete and of a short time 
span and have measurable outputs. If materials and equipment are a significant por￾tion of the cost of work packages, they can be budgeted in separate work packages 
and cost accounts.

Methods of Variance Analysis
Generally the method for measuring accomplishments centers on two key computations:
1. Comparing earned value with the expected schedule value.
2. Comparing earned value with the actual costs.
These comparisons can be made at the project level or down to the cost account level. 
Project status can be determined for the latest period, all periods to date, and estimated 
to the end of the project.
Assessing the current status of a project using the earned value cost/schedule sys￾tem requires three data elements—planned cost of the work scheduled (PV), budgeted 
cost of the work completed (EV), and actual cost of the work completed (AC). From 
these data, the schedule variance (SV) and cost variance (CV) are computed each 
reporting period. A positive variance indicates a desirable condition, while a negative 
variance suggests problems or changes that have taken place.
Cost variance tells us if the work accomplished costs more or less than was planned 
at any point over the life of the project. If labor and materials have not been sepa￾rated, cost variance should be reviewed carefully to isolate the cause to either labor or 
materials—or to both.
Schedule variance presents an overall assessment of all work packages in the proj￾ect scheduled to date. It is important to note schedule variance contains no critical 
path information. Critical and noncritical activities are combined in the calculation. 
Schedule variance measures progress in dollars rather than time units. Therefore, it is 
unlikely that any translation of dollars to time will yield accurate information telling 
if any milestone or critical path is early, on time, or late (even if the project occurs 
exactly as planned). The only accurate method for determining the true time progress 
of the project is to compare the project network schedule against the actual network 
schedule to measure if the project is on time (refer to Figure 13.1). However, SV is 
very useful in assessing the direction all the work in the project is taking—after 20 or 
more percent of the project has been completed.
Figure 13.4 presents a sample cost/schedule graph with variances identified for a 
project at the current status report date. Note the graph also focuses on what remains 
to be accomplished and any favorable or unfavorable trends. The “today” label marks 
the report date (time period 25) of where the project has been and where it is going. 
Because our system is hierarchical, graphs of the same form can be developed for 
different levels of management. In Figure 13.4 the top line represents the actual costs 
(AC) incurred for the project work to date. The middle line is the baseline (PV) and 
ends at the scheduled project duration (45). The bottom line is the budgeted value 
of the work actually completed to date (EV), or the earned value. The dotted line 
extending the actual costs from the report date to the new estimated completion date 
represents revised estimates of expected actual costs; that is, additional information 
suggests the costs at completion of the project will differ from what was planned. Note 
that the project duration has been extended and the variance at completion (VAC) is 
negative (BAC − EAC).
Another interpretation of the graph uses percentages. At the end of period 25, 75 percent 
of the work was scheduled to be accomplished. At the end of period 25, the value of the 
work accomplished is 50 percent. The actual cost of the work completed to date is $340, 
or 85 percent of the total project budget. The graph suggests the project will have about 
an 18 percent cost overrun and be five time units late. The current status of the project

shows the cost variance (CV) to be over budget by $140 (EV − AC = 200 − 340 = −140). 
The schedule variance (SV) is negative $100 (EV − PV = 200 − 300 = −100), which 
suggests the project is behind schedule. Before moving to an example, consult Figure 
13.5 to practice interpreting the outcomes of cost/schedule graphs. Remember, PV is 
your baseline and anchor point.

13.5 Developing a Status Report: A Hypothetical Example
Working through an example demonstrates how the baseline serves as the anchor from 
which the project can be monitored using earned value techniques.
Assumptions
Because the process becomes geometrically complex with the addition of project 
detail, some simplifying assumptions are made in the example to more easily demon￾strate the process:
1. Assume each cost account has only one work package, and each cost account will 
be represented as an activity on the network.
2. The project network early start times will serve as the basis for assigning the base￾line values.
3. From the moment work on an activity task begins, some actual costs will be incurred 
each period until the activity is completed.
Baseline Development
Figure 13.6 (Work Breakdown Structure with Cost Accounts) depicts a simple work 
breakdown structure (WBS/OBS) for a project with the objective of developing a new 
digital camera. There are six deliverables (Design Specifications, Shell & Power, 
Memory/Software, Zoom System, Assemble, and Test), and five responsible depart￾ments (Design, Shell, Storage, Zoom, and Assembly). The total for all the cost accounts

(CA) is $320,000, which represents the total project cost. Figure 13.7, derived from 
the WBS, presents a planning Gantt chart for the Digital Camera project. The planned 
project duration is 11 time units. This project information is used to time-phase the 
project budget baseline. Figure 13.8 (project baseline budget) presents a worksheet 
with an early start baseline developed with costs assigned. They are assigned “exactly” 
as managers plan to monitor and measure schedule and cost performance.
Development of the Status Report
A status report is analogous to a camera snapshot of a project at a specific point in 
time. The status report uses earned value to measure schedule and cost performance. 
Measuring earned value begins at the work package level. Work packages are in one of 
three conditions on a report date:
1. Not yet started.
2. Finished.
3. In process or partially complete.
Earned values for the first two conditions present no difficulties. Work packages 
that are not yet started earn zero percent of the PV (budget). Packages that are com￾pleted earn 100 percent of their PV. In-process packages apply the percent complete 
rule to the PV baseline to measure earned value (EV). In our camera example, we will 
only use the percent complete rule to measure progress.
Table 13.3 presents the completed, separate status reports of the Digital Camera Pro￾totype project for periods 1 through 7. Each period percent complete and actual cost

were gathered for each task from staff in the field. The schedule and cost variance are 
computed for each task and the project to date. For example, the status in period 1 shows 
only Task A (Design Specifications) is in process and it is 50 percent complete, and the 
actual cost for the task is 10. The planned value at the end of period 1 for Task A is 10 
(see Figure 13.8). The cost and schedule variance are both zero, which indicates the proj￾ect is on budget and schedule. By the end of period 3, Task A is finished; Task B (Shell 
& Power) is 33 percent complete and AC is 10; Task C is 20 percent complete and AC 
is 30; and Task D is 60 percent complete and AC is 20. Again, from Figure 13.8 at the 
end of period 3, we can see that the PV for Task A is 20 (10 + 10 = 20), for Task B is 
5, for Task C is 20, and for Task D is 15. At the end of period 3 it is becoming clear the 
actual cost (AC) is exceeding the value of the work completed (EV). The cost variance 
(see Table 13.3) for the project at the end of period 3 is negative 24. Schedule variance is 
positive 6, which suggests the project may be ahead of schedule.
It is important to note that since earned values are computed from costs (or some￾times labor hours or other metrics), the relationship of costs to time is not one-for-one. 
For example, it is possible to have a negative SV variance when the project is actually 
ahead on the critical path. This occurs when delays in noncritical activities outweigh 
progress on the critical path. Therefore, it is important to remember that SV is in dol￾lars and is not an accurate measure of time; however, it is a fairly good indicator of the 
status of the whole project in terms of being ahead or behind schedule after the project 
is over 20 percent complete. Only the project network, or tracking Gantt chart, and 
actual work completed can give an accurate assessment of schedule performance down 
to the work package level.
By studying the separate status reports for periods 5 through 7, you can see the 
project will be over budget and behind schedule. By period 7, Tasks A, B, and D are 
finished, but all are over budget—negative 10, 5, and 25. Task C (Memory/Software) 
is 90 percent complete. Task E is late and hasn’t started because Task C is not yet 
completed. The result is that, at the end of period 7, the Digital Camera project is over 
budget $70,000, with a schedule budget over $40,000.
Figure 13.9 shows the graphed results of all the status reports through period 7.

date and the earned value budgeted costs to date (EV) are plotted against the original 
project baseline (PV). The cumulative AC to date is $230,000; the cumulative EV to 
date is $160,000. Given these cumulative values, the cost variance (CV = EV − AC) is 
negative $70,000 (160,000 − 230,000 = −70,000). The schedule variance (SV = EV 
− PV) is negative $40,000 (160,000 − 200,000 = −40,000). Again, recall that only the 
project network or tracking Gantt chart can give an accurate assessment of schedule 
performance down to the work package level.
A tracking Gantt bar chart for the Digital Camera Prototype is shown in Figure 
13.10. From this figure you can see Task C (Memory/Software), which had an original 
duration of four time units, now is expected to require six time units. This delay of two 
time units for Task C will also delay Tasks E and F two time units and result in the 
project being late for two time periods.
Figure 13.11 shows an oversimplified project rollup at the end of period 7. The 
rollup is by deliverables and organization units. For example, the Memory/Software 
deliverable has an SV of $−10,000 and a CV of $−30,000. The responsible “Storage” 
Department should have an explanation for these variances. Similarly, the Assembly 
Department, which is responsible for the Assemble and Test deliverables, has an SV 
of $−30,000 due to the delay of Task C (see Figure 13.10). Most deliverables look 
unfavorable on schedule and cost variance.
In more complex projects, the crosstabs of cost accounts by deliverables and organiza￾tion units can be very revealing and more profound. This example contains the basics for 
developing a status report, developing baselines, and measuring schedule and cost vari￾ance. In our example, performance analysis had only one level above the cost account 
level. Because all data are derived from the detailed database, it is relatively easy to 
determine the progress status at all levels of the work and organization breakdown struc￾tures. Fortunately, this same current database can provide additional views of the current 
status of the project and forecast costs at the completion of the project. Approaches for 
deriving additional information from the database are presented next.
To the uninitiated, a caveat is in order. In practice, budgets may not be expressed 
in total dollars for an activity. Frequently budgets are time-phased for materials and 
labor separately for more effective control over costs. Another common approach is to 
use labor hours in place of dollars in the earned value system. Later, labor hours are

converted to dollars. The use of labor hours in the earned value system is the modus 
operandi for most construction work. Labor hours are easy to understand and are often 
the way many time and cost estimates are developed. Most earned value software eas￾ily accommodates the use of labor hours for the development of cost estimates.
13.6 Indexes to Monitor Progress
Practitioners sometimes prefer to use schedule and cost indexes over the absolute 
values of SV and CV, because indexes can be considered efficiency ratios. Graphed 
indexes over the project life cycle can be very illuminating and useful. The trends are 
easily identified for deliverables and the whole project.
Indexes are typically used at the cost account level and above. In practice, the data￾base is also used to develop indexes that allow the project manager and customer to 
view progress from several angles. An index of 1.00 (100 percent) indicates progress 
is as planned. An index greater than 1.00 shows progress is better than expected. An 
index less than 1.00 suggests progress is poorer than planned and deserves attention. 
Table 13.4 presents the interpretation of the indexes.

Performance Indexes
There are two indexes of performance efficiency. The first index measures the cost
efficiency of the work accomplished to date (data from Table 13.3):
Cost performance index (CPI) = EV/AC = 160/230 = .696, or .70
The CPI of .70 shows that $.70 worth of work planned to date has been completed 
for each $1.00 actually spent—an unfavorable situation indeed. The CPI is the most 
accepted and used index. It has been tested over time and found to be the most accu￾rate, reliable, and stable. For example, U.S. government studies have shown that the 
CPI is stable from as early as the 20 percent completion point regardless of contract 
type, program, or service. The CPI can provide an early warning signal as to cost over￾runs so that adjustments can be made to the budget or scope of a project.1
The second index is a measure of scheduling efficiency to date:
Scheduling performance index (SPI) = EV/PV = 160/200 = .80
The schedule index indicates $.80 worth of work has been accomplished for each $1.00 
worth of scheduled work to date. Figure 13.12 shows the indexes plotted for our exam￾ple project through period 7. This figure is another example of graphs used in practice.

Project Percent Complete Indexes
Two project percent complete indexes are used, depending on your judgment of which 
one is most representative of your project. The first index assumes the original budget 
of work complete is the most reliable information to measure project percent complete. 
The second index assumes the actual costs-to-date and expected cost at completion are 
the most reliable for measuring project percent complete. These indexes compare the 
to-date progress to the end of the project. The implications underlying the use of these 
indexes are that conditions will not change, no improvement or action will be taken, 
and the information in the database is accurate. The first index looks at percent com￾plete in terms of budget amounts:
Percent complete index budgeted costs
PCIB = EV/BAC = 160/320 = .50 (50%)
This PCIB indicates the work accomplished represents 50 percent of the total bud￾geted (BAC) dollars to date. Observe that this calculation does not include actual costs 
incurred. Because actual dollars spent do not guarantee project progress, this index 
is favored by many project managers when there is a high level of confidence in the 
original budget estimates.
The second index views percent complete in terms of actual dollars spent to accom￾plish the work to date and the actual expected dollars for the completed project (EAC). 
For example, at the end of period 7, the staff re-estimates that the EAC will be 575 
instead of 320. The application of this view is written as
Percent complete index actual costs PCIC = AC/EAC = 230/575 = .40(40%)
Some managers favor this index because it contains actual and revised estimates that 
include newer, more complete information.
These two views of percent complete present alternative views of the “real” percent 
complete. These percents may be quite different, as shown. (Note: The PCIC index 
was not plotted in Figure 13.12. The new figures for EAC would be derived each 
period by estimators in the field.)
A third percent index that is popular in the construction industry reflects the amount 
of management reserves that have been absorbed by cost overruns. Remember that 
management reserves are funds set aside to cover unforeseen events (see Chapter 7). 
Let’s assume that $40 was reserved for the Digital Camera project:
Management reserve index MRI = CV/MR = The percentage of 140/40 = 3.50 (350%)
The project has already spent 3 and half times the total funds set aside as management 
reserve. Clearly, this project is in trouble and changes in either the scope or the budget are 
required. Many managers assess cost overruns in terms of management reserves rather 
than simply cost variance, since it reflects how much one can afford to spend on the project.
Software for Project Cost/Schedule Systems
Software developers have created sophisticated schedule/cost systems for projects 
that track and report budget, actual, earned, committed, and index values. These val￾ues can be labor hours, materials, and/or dollars. This information supports cost and 
schedule progress, performance measurements, and cash flow management. Recall 
Final PDF to printer506 Chapter 13 Progress and Performance Measurement and Evaluation
lar60886_ch13_485-542.indd 506 10/14/23 11:56 am
from Chapter 5 that budget, actual, and committed dollars usually run in different time 
frames (see Figure 5.6). A typical computer-generated status report includes the fol￾lowing information outputs:
1. Schedule variance (EV − PV) by cost account and WBS and OBS.
2. Cost variance (EV − AC) by cost account and WBS and OBS.
3. Indexes—total percent complete and performance index.
4. Cumulative actual total cost to date (AC).
5. Expected costs at completion (EAC).
6. Paid and unpaid commitments.
The variety of software packages, with their features and constant updating, is 
too extensive for inclusion in this text. Software developers and vendors have done a 
superb job of providing software to meet the information needs of most project man￾agers. Differences among software in the last decade have centered on improving 
“friendliness” and output that is clear and easy to understand. Anyone who under￾stands the concepts and tools presented in Chapters 4, 5, 6, 8, and 13 should have 
little trouble understanding the output of any of the popular project management 
software packages.
Additional Earned Value Rules
Although the percent complete rule is the most-used method of assigning budgets to 
baselines and for cost control, there are additional rules that are very useful for reduc￾ing the overhead costs of collecting detailed data on percent complete of individual 
work packages. (An additional advantage of these rules, of course, is that they remove 
the often subjective judgments of the contractors or estimators as to how much work 
has actually been completed.) The first two rules are typically used for short-duration 
activities and/or small-cost activities. The third rule uses gates before the total bud￾geted value of an activity can be claimed.
∙ 0/100 rule. This rule assumes credit is earned for having performed the work once 
it is completed. Hence, 100 percent of the budget is earned when the work package 
is completed. This rule is used for work packages having very short durations.
∙ 50/50 rule. This approach allows 50 percent of the value of the work package bud￾get to be earned when it is started and 50 percent to be earned when the package 
is completed. This rule is popular for work packages of short duration and small 
total costs.
∙ Percent complete with weighted monitoring gates. This more recent rule uses 
subjective estimated percent complete in combination with hard, tangible moni￾toring points. This method works well on long-duration activities that can be bro￾ken into short, discrete work packages of no more than one or two report periods. 
These discrete packages limit the subjective estimated values. For example, assume 
a long-duration activity with a total budget of $500. The activity is cut into three 
sequentially discrete packages with monitoring gates representing 30, 50, and 100 
percent of the total budget. The earned amount at each monitoring gate cannot 
exceed $150, $250, and $500. These hard monitoring points serve as a check on 
overly optimistic estimates.
Notice the only information needed for the first two rules is that the work package 
has started and the package has been completed. Appendix 13.1 presents two exercises 
that apply these rules along with the percent complete rule.

The third rule is frequently used to authorize progress payments to contractors. This 
rule supports careful tracking and control of payments; it discourages payment to con￾tractors for work not yet completed.
13.7 Forecasting Final Project Cost
There are basically two methods used to revise estimates of future project costs. In 
many cases, both methods are used on specific segments of the project. The result is 
confusion of terms in texts, in software, and among practitioners in the field. We have 
chosen to note the differences between the methods.
The first method allows experts in the field to change original baseline durations 
and costs because new information tells them the original estimates are not accurate. 
We have used EACre to represent revisions made by experts and practitioners associ￾ated with the project. The revisions from project experts are almost always used on 
smaller projects.
The equation for calculating revised estimated cost at completion (EACre) is as follows:
EACre = AC + ETCre
where EACre = revised estimated cost at completion.
AC = cumulative actual cost of work completed to date. 
ETCre = revised estimated cost to complete remaining work.
A second method is used in large projects where the original budget is reliable. This 
method uses the actual costs to date plus an efficiency index (CPI = EV/AC) applied 
to the remaining project work. When the estimate for completion uses the CPI as the 
basis for forecasting cost at completion, we use the acronym EACf
. The equation for 
this forecasting model (EACf
) is as follows:
EACf = ETC + AC
 ETC = Work remaining ______________
CPI = _
BAC − EV
EV/AC 
where EACf = forecasted total cost at completion.
 
ETC = estimated cost to complete remaining work.
 AC = cumulative actual cost of work completed to date. CPI = cumulative cost index to date. 
BAC = total budget of the baseline.
 
EV = cumulative budgeted cost of work completed to date.
The following information is available from our earlier example; the estimated cost at 
completion (EACf
) is computed as follows:
in $000
Total baseline budget (BAC) for the project $320
Cumulative earned value (EV) to date $160
Cumulative actual cost (AC) to date $230
EACf = _
320 − 160
160/230 + 230 = _
160
.7 + 230 = 229 + 230 
EACf = 459

The final project projected cost forecast is $459,000 versus $320,000 originally 
planned.
Another popular index is the To complete performance index (TCPI), which is use￾ful as a supplement to the estimate at complete (EACf
) computation. This ratio measures 
the amount of value each remaining dollar in the budget must earn to stay within the 
budget. The index is computed for the Digital Camera project at the end of period 7:
TCPI = _
BAC − EV
BAC − AC = _
320 − 160
320 − 230 = _
160
90 = 1.78
The index of 1.78 indicates that each remaining dollar in the budget must earn $1.78 in 
value in order for the project to stay within budget. There is more work to be done than 
there is budget left. Clearly, it would be tough to increase productivity that much to make 
budget. The work to be done will have to be reduced, or you will have to accept running 
over budget. If the TCPI is less than 1.00, you should be able to complete the project 
without using all of the remaining budget. A ratio of less than 1.00 opens the possibility 
of other opportunities such as improving quality, increasing profit, or expanding scope.
Research data indicate that on large projects that are more than 15 percent complete, 
the model performs well with an error of less than 10 percent (Christensen, 1998; Flem￾ing & Koppleman, 2010). This model can also be used for WBS and OBS cost accounts 
that have been used to forecast remaining and total costs. It is important to note that this 
model assumes conditions will not change, the cost database is reliable, EV and AC are 
cumulative, and past project progress is representative of future progress. This objective 
forecast represents a good starting point or benchmark that management can use to com￾pare other forecasts that include other conditions and subjective judgments.

Project description: A computer-controlled conveyor belt that will move and position items on the belt 
with accuracy of less than one millimeter. 
Status summary: The project is approximately 25 days behind schedule and $30,736 over budget. 
Explanations: The schedule variance has moved from noncritical activities to those on the critical path. 
Integration first phase, scheduled to start 3/26, is now expected to start 4/19, which means it is approxi￾mately 25 days behind schedule. This delay is traced to the loss of the second design team, which made 
it impossible to start utilities documentation on 2/27 as planned. The cost variance to date is largely due 
to a design change that cost $21,000. 
Major changes since last report: The major change was loss of one design team to the project. 
Total cost of approved design changes: $21,000. Most of this amount is attributed to the improved 
design of the serial I/O drivers. 
Projected cost at completion: EACf
 is estimated to be $1,107,469. This represents an overrun of 
$56,269, given a CPI of .95. 
Forecasted completion date: October 23. 
Risk watch: Five team members were stricken with flu.

Another summary report is shown in Snapshot from Practice 13.2: Trojan Decom￾missioning Project. Compare the differences in format. Software companies are devel￾oping electronic dashboards that show project progress against key performance 
measures of the projects. The dashboards use tables and colored graphics to display 
project performance data like percentage complete, budget consumption, CPI, work￾loads, etc.
13.8 Other Control Issues
Technical Performance Measurement
Measuring technical performance is as important as, if not more important than, measur￾ing schedule and cost performance. After all, who cares if the project is under budget or 
ahead of schedule if the deliverable doesn’t work? The ramifications of poor technical 
performance frequently are profound—re-work, dissatisfied customers, and tarnished 
reputation.
Assessing technical performance of a system, facility, or product is often accom￾plished by examining the requirements found in the scope statement and/or work 
packages. Requirements should specify criteria and tolerance limits against which per￾formance can be measured. For example, the technical performance of a software proj￾ect suffered because the feature of “drag and drop” was deleted in the final product. 
Conversely, the prototype of an experimental car exceeded the miles per gallon techni￾cal specification and, thus, its technical performance. Frequently tests and inspections 
are conducted on different performance dimensions. These tests become an integral 
part of the project schedule.
It is difficult to specify how to measure technical performance because it depends 
on the nature of the project. For example, a marketing project might use the number of 
Portland General Electric Company 
has been charged with decommission￾ing the Trojan Nuclear Plant. This is a 
long and complex project extending 
over two decades. The first segment 
of the project of moving the used reactors to a stor￾age location is complete and was awarded the Project 
of the Year, 2000, by the Project Management Institute 
(PMI). The remainder of the project—decontamination 
of the remaining structures and waste—is ongoing.

status report. This report measures schedule and cost 
performance for monitoring the project. The report also 
serves as a basis for funding for rate filings with the 
Public Utilities Commission.

“likes” at their Facebook site as an indicator of performance. Alternatively, a software 
project may rely on frequency of bugs (errors) discovered as an indicator of techni￾cal performance. Technical performance is frequently where quality control processes 
are needed and used. Here quality tools like histograms, scatter diagrams, and Pareto 
charts are used to identify the root causes of the problems.
Scope Creep
Large changes in scope are easily identified. It is the “minor refinements” that eventu￾ally build to be major scope changes that can cause problems. These small refine￾ments are known in the field as scope creep. For example, the customer of a software 
developer requested small changes in the development of a custom accounting soft￾ware package. After several minor refinements, it became apparent the changes rep￾resented a significant enlargement of the original project scope. The result was an 
unhappy customer and a development firm that lost money and reputation.
Although scope changes are usually viewed negatively, there are situations 
when scope changes result in positive rewards. Scope changes can represent sig￾nificant opportunities.2 In product development environments, adding a small 
feature to a product can result in a huge competitive advantage. A small change in 
the production process may get the product to market one month early or reduce 
product cost.
Scope creep is common early in projects—especially in new-product develop￾ment projects. Customer requirements for additional features, new technology, poor 
design assumptions, and so on, all manifest pressures for scope changes. Frequently 
these changes are small and go unnoticed until time delays or cost overruns are 
observed. Scope creep affects the organization, project team, and project suppliers. 
Scope changes alter the organization’s cash flow requirements in the form of fewer 
or additional resources, which may also affect other projects. Frequent changes 
eventually wear down team motivation and cohesiveness. Clear team goals are 
altered, become less focused, and cease being the focal point for team action. Start￾ing over again is annoying and demoralizing to the project team because it disrupts 
project rhythm and lowers productivity. Project suppliers resent frequent changes 
because they represent higher costs and have the same effect on their team as on the 
project team.
The key to managing scope creep is change management. Many project manag￾ers report that scope creep was the biggest risk their firm faced in projects. The best 
defense against scope creep is a well-defined scope statement and communication. 
Poor scope statements are one of the major causes of scope creep.
A second defense against scope creep is stating what the project is not, which 
can avoid misinterpretations later. (Chapter 7 discusses the change control process. 
See Figure 7.9 to review key variables to document in project changes.) First, the 
original baseline must be well defined and agreed upon with the project customer. 
Before the project begins, it is imperative that clear procedures be in place for autho￾rizing and documenting scope changes by the customer or project team. If a scope 
change is necessary, the impact on the baseline should be clearly documented—for 
example, cost, time, dependencies, specifications, or responsibilities. Finally, the 
scope change must be quickly added to the original baseline to reflect the change in 
budget and schedule; these changes and their impacts need to be communicated to 
all project stakeholders.

Baseline Changes
Changes during the life cycle of projects are inevitable. Some changes can be very ben￾eficial to project outcomes; changes having a negative impact are the ones we wish to 
avoid. Careful project definition can minimize the need for changes. The price for poor 
project definition can change that result in cost overruns, late schedules, low morale, 
and loss of control. Change comes from external sources or from within. Externally, 
for example, the customer may request changes that were not included in the original 
scope statement and that will require significant changes to the project and thus to the 
baseline. Or the government may render requirements that were not a part of the origi￾nal plan and that require a revision of the project scope. Internally, stakeholders may 
identify unforeseen problems or improvements that change the scope of the project.
Force majeure, or acts of nature, such as hurricanes or floods can disrupt plans 
and force resetting a baseline. Imagine how many baselines were made meaningless by 
the COVID-19 virus! Given the recovery uncertainty, it made no sense to try to reset 
a baseline. Many projects were postponed or canceled. Other companies used agile 
methods (see Chapter 15) to navigate the project until things cleared and the project 
could be planned with some degree of certainty again. See Snapshot from Practice: 
Oregon State University’s RCRV Project that had to reformulate its baseline three 
times and used EVM to manage the project.
In 2019 Oregon State University (OSU) 
and its College of Earth, Ocean, and 
Atmospheric Sciences (CEOAS), on 
behalf of the National Science Founda￾tion (NSF), began construction of three, 
“next generation,” regional coastal research vessels 
(RCRV). The price tag for the entire project was $354M 
for the multi-year project. The new vessels would be 
equipped with a state-of-the-art sensor suite capable of 
making measurements from below the ocean bottom to 
the top of the atmosphere and to relay those measure￾ments in real time, to researchers around the world. To 
help with that, the vessels will also have dynamic posi￾tioning that will help them stay in place in rugged seas. 
This is needed to launch and retrieve gliders and other 
remotely operated vehicles as well as to conduct pre￾cise mapping of the ocean floor.
One of the new requirements imposed by NSF 
in the grant application was a commitment to using 
earned value management (EVM) to monitor costs and 
schedules. Demian Bailey, the OSU project manager, 
had limited experience with earned value and most of 
the research scientists at CEOAS had never heard of 
the concept. Some may have thought EVM was another 
“bureaucratic control” that would get in the way of 
S N A P S H O T F R O M P R A C T I C E Oregon State University’s Regional 
Coastal Research Vessels (RCRV) Project*
getting the project done. CEOAS drew upon the project 
management expertise of the College of Business at 
OSU in their grant submission.
The RCRV project’s journey to date has been a 
rough one. Among the major obstacles, Bailey and his 
team encountered included the original shipyard being 
acquired, the COVID-19 pandemic, and Hurricane Ida—
which disrupted shipbuilding. These forced three major 
revisions of the baseline plan. The estimated comple￾tion date has been extended from mid 2023 to early 
2026. Bailey estimated that there have been over 
300 days of downtime due to these and other events 
outside their control.

How about EVM?
In 2023, NSF scheduled a self-assessment of the RCRV 
earned value management system:
Does the use of EVM by the project, as described in the 
OSU self-assessment, provide effective evaluation of 
progress against the baseline plan, adequate informa￾tion on cost and schedule performance, and is EVM 
being used to inform timely management decisions?
So how did first-time users of EVM assess the value 
of using EVM despite the hardships they experienced?
Bailey and his team concluded that EVM was criti￾cal to overcoming the obstacles they encountered and 
getting the project back on track:
“The RCRV has built its entire project management 
structure around its EVM system. The system serves 
as a vibrant, relevant, and useful tool to provide 
insights into project performance. But, beyond those 
insights, it provides control of the baseline and pro￾vides a flexible structure for project leaders to man￾age their scope and, frankly, do their jobs.”
Conclusion: RCRV Self-Assessment
The report contained specific examples of how EVM 
has been used to manage the RCRV project. For 
example, in response to Hurricane Ida, management 
was able to use EVM to quickly distinguish delays and 
to what extent they occur. This allowed management 
to quickly establish a robust and defensible Manage￾ment Reserve request. EVM was critical in justifying the 
request and the eventual distribution of $17 million in 
the budget. If EVM system had not been established 
before the hurricane event, OSU would have had to 
spend a lot of time creating justifications for additional 
hurricane-attributable costs. Cost estimates were 
linked directly to the EVM system, so it was a simple 
matter to forecast Ida’s impacts.
Another example was how EVM has helped OSU 
manage the Shipyard.
Shipbuilder X (SBX) presented a six-month sched￾ule wherein they claimed they could, through various 
schedule crashing techniques, meet ambitious mile￾stones. OSU pushed back, using earned value (EV) data 
to date, to illustrate that their plan was likely unachiev￾able. In one case, OSU’s deputy Shipyard Manager, an 
experienced shipbuilder with deep EVM understand￾ing, used the historical metric of earned value percent 
of total per month earned. He showed that today, SBX 
has never earned more than 1% per month whereas 
their plan indicated. They would need to earn at least 3 
times that to meet their milestones.
The EVM analysis revealed SBX losing roughly one 
week per month on the critical path. OSU was able to 
inform stakeholders that the delivery of Vessel 1 has 
slipped 4 months to January 2024. The project could 
now plan accordingly due to this proactive decision 
based on EVM data. For example, certain aggressive 
procurement timelines could be relaxed. The OSU crew 
could be sent out in a relief capacity throughout the 
Academic Research Fleet for a longer window of time. 
This example additionally shows the integration of EVM 
data decision making between control accounts.
Examples of EVM Reporting System
Below are examples of how EV data are reported in 
status reports. Table 13.5 features segments of the 
Top Level Earned Value table used in an RCRV proj￾ect for all three vessels. It includes data for the first 
six quarters, after the Hurricane Ida re-plan. Note, in 
addition to traditional EV indicators, the report tracks 
remaining contingency and funding from NSF to-date.
Figure 13.13 contains the Cost/Schedule graph 
rolling up 15,000 activities for the project and 
Figure 13.14 reports the Schedule Performance (SPI) 
and Cost Performance (CPI) since the Ida re-plan. 
Notice the progress made in getting back on schedule 
after falling behind the first three months.

Generally, project managers monitor scope changes very carefully. They should 
allow scope changes only if it is clear that the project will fail without the change, 
the project will be improved significantly with the change, or the customer wants it 
and will pay for it. This statement is an exaggeration, but it sets the tone for approach￾ing baseline changes. The effect of the change on the scope and baseline should be 
accepted and signed off by the project customer. Figure 13.15 depicts the cost impact 
of a scope change on the baseline at a point in time—“today.” New baseline A rep￾resents a scope change that results in an increase in cost. New baseline B represents 
a scope change that decreases cost. Quickly recording scope changes to the baseline 
keeps the computed earned values valid. Failure to do so results in misleading cost and 
schedule variances.
Care should be taken to not use baseline changes to disguise poor performance 
on past or current work. A common signal of this type of baseline change is a con￾stantly revised baseline that seems to match results. Practitioners call this a “rub￾ber baseline” because it stretches to match results. Most changes will not result in

serious scope changes and should be absorbed as positive or negative variances. 
Retroactive changes for work already accomplished should not be allowed. Trans￾fer of money among cost accounts should not be allowed after the work is com￾plete. Unforeseen changes can be handled through the contingency reserve. The 
project manager typically makes this decision. In some large projects, a partnering 
“change review team,” made up of members of the project and customer teams, 
makes all decisions on project changes.
The Costs and Problems of Data Acquisition
Data acquisition is time consuming and costly. Snapshot from Practice 13.3: A 
Pseudo-Earned Value Percent Complete Approach captures some of the frequent 
issues surrounding resistance to data collection of percent complete for earned 
value systems. Similar pseudo-percent complete systems have been used by oth￾ers. Such pseudo-percent complete approaches appear to work well in multiproject 
environments that include several small- and medium-sized projects. Assuming a 
one-week reporting period, care needs to be taken to develop work packages with a 
duration of about one week long so problems are identified quickly. For large proj￾ects, there is no substitute for using a percent complete system that depends on data 
collected through observation at clearly defined monitoring points.
In some cases, data exist but are not sent to the stakeholders who need informa￾tion relating to project progress. Clearly, if the information does not reach the right 
people in a timely manner, you can expect serious problems. Your communica￾tion plan developed in the project planning stage can greatly mitigate this problem 
by mapping out the flow of information and keeping stakeholders informed on all 
aspects of project progress and issues. See Figure 13.16 for an internal communica￾tion plan for a WiFi project. The information developed in this chapter contributes 
significant data to support your communication plan and ensures correct dissemi￾nation of the data.

A consultant for the U.S. Forest Service 
suggested the use of earned value to 
monitor the 50-plus timber sale proj￾ects taking place concurrently in the 
district. As projects were completed, 
new ones were started. Earned value was tried for 
approximately nine months. After a nine-month trial, 
the process was to be reviewed by a task force. The 
task force concluded the earned value system pro￾vided good information for monitoring and forecasting 
project progress; however, the costs and problems of 
collecting timely percent complete data were unac￾ceptable because there were no funds available to col￾lect such data.
The level of detail dilemma was discussed, but 
no suggestions satisfied the problem. The discussion 
recognized that too little data fail to offer good con￾trol, while excessive reporting requires paperwork and 
people, which are costly. The task force concluded 
progress and performance could be measured using 
a pseudo-version of percent complete while not giv￾ing up much accuracy for the total project. This modi￾fied approach to percent complete required that very 
large work packages (about 3 to 5 percent of all work 
packages in a project) be divided into smaller work 
packages for closer control and identification of prob￾lems sooner. It was decided work packages of about 
a week’s duration would be ideal. The pseudo-version 
required only a telephone call and yes/no answers 
to one of the following questions to assign percent 
complete:
Has work on the work package started? No = 0%
Working on the package? Yes = 50%
Is the work package completed? Yes = 100%
Data for the pseudo-earned value percent complete 
system were collected for all 50-plus projects by an 
intern working fewer than eight hours each week.
The pseudo-earned value method turned out 
to be a success. It provided sufficient performance 
information to monitor more than 50 projects. The 
key was limiting all work packages to one week 
whenever possible. This enabled management to 
keep track of costs and schedule despite the crude 
reporting method.

Summary The best information system does not result in good control. Control requires the proj￾ect manager to use the information to steer the project through rough waters. Con￾trol and Gantt charts are useful vehicles for monitoring time performance. Earned 
value management (EVM) allows the manager to have a positive influence on cost 
and schedule in a timely manner. The ability to influence cost decreases with time; 
therefore, timely reports identifying adverse cost trends can greatly assist the project

manager in getting back on budget and schedule. EVM provides the project manager 
and other stakeholders with a snapshot of the current and future status of the project. 
The benefits of EVM are as follows:
1. Measures accomplishments against plan and deliverables.
2. Provides a method for tracking directly to a problem work package and organiza￾tion unit responsible.
3. Alerts all stakeholders to early identification of problems and allows for quick, 
proactive corrective action.
4. Improves communication because all stakeholders are using the same database.
5. Keeps customers informed of progress and encourages customer confidence that 
the money spent is resulting in the expected progress.
6. Provides for accountability over individual portions of the overall budget for each 
organization unit.
These benefits are significant, but one must remember that EVM systems focus on 
costs and time and assume technical performance. Project managers need to monitor 
and make technical performance a key agenda item.

Part B. You have met with your Aurora project team and they have provided you with 
the following revised estimates for the remainder of the project:
∙ Activity F will be completed at the end of period 12 at a total cost of $500.
∙ Activity G will be completed at the end of period 10 at a total cost of $150.
∙ Activity H will be completed at the end of period 14 at a total cost of $200.
Calculate the EACre and VACre. Based on the revised estimates, what is the expected 
status of the project in terms of cost and schedule? Between the VACf
 and the 
VACre, which one would you have the greatest confidence in?

 Case 13.1
Tree Trimming Project
Layla Fence is a large timber and Christmas tree farmer who is attending a project 
management class in the spring, her offseason. When the class topic came to earned 
value, she was perplexed. Isn’t she using EV?
Each summer Layla hires crews to shear fields of Christmas trees for the coming 
holiday season. Shearing entails having a worker use a large machete to shear the 
branches of the tree into a nice, cone-shaped tree.
Layla describes her business as follows:
A. I count the number of Douglas Fir Christmas trees in the field (24,000).
B. Next, I agree on a contract lump sum for shearing with a crew boss for the whole 
field ($30,000).
C. When partial payment for work completed arrives (5 days later), I count or esti￾mate the actual number sheared (6,000 trees). I take the actual as a percent of the 
total to be sheared and multiply the percent complete by total contract amount for 
the partial payment [(6,000/$24,000 = 25%), (.25 × $30,000 = $7,500)].
1. Is Layla over, on, or below cost and schedule? Is Layla using earned value?
2. How can Layla set up a scheduling variance?
 Case 13.2
Ventura Stadium Status Report Case
You are an assistant to Percival Young, president of G&E Company. He has asked you 
to prepare a brief report on the status of the Ventura Stadium project.
Ventura Stadium is a 47,000-seat professional baseball stadium. Construction 
started on July 8, 2019, and the stadium is to be completed on February 21, 2022. The 
project is estimated to cost $320,000,000. There are $35 million management reserves 
to deal with unexpected problems and delays.
The stadium must be ready for the 2022 major league season. G&E would accrue a 
$500,000 per day penalty for not meeting the April 3, 2022, deadline.
It is February 25, 2021, the day crews start installing seats.
Tables C13.1 and C13.2 contain information submitted by your counterpart at the 
Ventura site from which you are to prepare your report. Use the appropriate indexes/
information to prepare a report informing Mr. Young on the overall status of the Ven￾tura project in terms of costs and schedule. Note: Mr. Young is not interested in specif￾ics, just how well the overall project is doing and if there is a need to take corrective 
action.

Actual Progress as of January 1
 Case 13.3
Scanner Project
You have been serving as Electroscan’s project manager and are now well along in 
the project. Develop a narrative status report for the board of directors of the chain 
store that discusses the status of the project to date (see Table C13.3) and at comple￾tion. Be as specific as you can, using the numbers given and those you might develop. 
Remember, your audience is not familiar with the jargon used by project managers 
and computer software personnel; therefore, some explanation may be necessary. Your 
report will be evaluated on your detailed use of the data, your total perspective of the 
current status and future status of the project, and your recommended changes (if any).

Appendix 13.1
The Application of Additional Earned Value Rules
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
After reading this appendix you should be able to:
A13.1-1 Apply pseudo-earned value rules to measure progress on a project.
The following example and exercises are designed to provide practice in applying the 
following three earned value rules:
1. Percent complete rule
2. 50/50 rule
3. 0/100 rule
See the chapter for an explanation of each of these rules.
Simplifying Assumptions
The same simplifying assumptions used for the chapter example and exercises will 
also be used here.
1. Assume each cost account has only one work package, and each cost account will 
be represented as an activity on the network.
2. The project network early start times will serve as the basis for assigning the base￾line values.
3. Except when the 0/100 rule or 50/50 rule is used, baseline values will be assigned 
linearly, unless stated differently. (Note: In practice, estimated costs should be 
applied “exactly” as they are expected to occur so measures of schedule and cost 
performance are useful and reliable.)
4. For purposes of demonstrating the examples, from the moment work on an activ￾ity begins, some actual costs will be incurred each period until the activity is 
completed.
5. When the 0/100 rule is used, the total cost for the activity is placed in the baseline 
on the early finish date.
6. When the 50/50 rule is used, 50 percent of the total cost is placed in the baseline on 
the early start date and 50 percent on the early finish date.
Appendix Exercises
1. Given the information provided for the development of a product warranty project 
for periods 1 through 7, compute the SV, CV, SPI, and CPI for each period. Fig￾ure A13.1–1A presents the project network. Figure A13.1–1B presents the project 
baseline, noting those activities using the 0/100 (rule 3) and 50/50 (rule 2) rules. 
For example, activity 1 uses rule 3, the 0/100 rule. Although the early start time is 
period 0, the budget is not placed in the time-phased baseline until period 2 when 
the activity is planned to be finished (EF). This same procedure has been used to 
assign costs for activities 2 and 7. Activities 2 and 7 use the 50/50 rule. Thus, 50

percent of the budget for each activity is assigned on its respective early start date 
(time period 2 for activity 2 and period 11 for activity 7) and 50 percent for their 
respective finish dates. Remember, when assigning earned value as the project is 
being implemented, if an activity actually starts early or late, the earned values 
must shift with the actual times. For example, if activity 7 actually starts in period 
12 rather than 11, the 50 percent is not earned until period 12.
Plot the EV and the AC on the PV graph provided (Figure A13.1–1C). Use Fig￾ure A13.1–1D to plot the CPI, SPI, and PCIB. Explain to the owner your assess￾ment of the project at the end of period 7 and the future expected status of the 
project at completion.

Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to relive it.
—George Santayana, 1863–1952
Every project comes to an end eventually. But how many project participants get excited 
about closing out a project? The deliverables are complete. Ownership is ready to be 
transferred. Everyone’s focus is on what’s next—hopefully a new, exciting project. Care￾fully managing the closure phase is as important as any other phase of the project. Obser￾vation tells us that organizations that manage closure will prosper. Those who don’t tend 
to have projects that drag on forever and repeat the same mistakes over and over.
Closing out a project includes a daunting number of tasks. In the past and on small 
projects the project manager was responsible for seeing all tasks and loose ends were 
completed and signed off. This is no longer true. In today’s project-driven organiza￾tions that have many projects occurring simultaneously, the responsibility for complet￾ing closure tasks has been parsed among the project manager, project teams, project 
office, contracts office, Human Resources, and others. Many tasks overlap, occur 
simultaneously, and require coordination and cooperation among these stakeholders.
The three major deliverables for project closure are as follows (see Figure 14.1):
1. Wrapping up the project. The major wrap-up task is to ensure the project is 
approved and accepted by the customer. Other wrap-up activities include closing 
accounts, paying bills, reassigning equipment and personnel, finding new opportu￾nities for project staff, closing facilities, and issuing the final report. Checklists are 
used extensively to ensure tasks are not overlooked. In many organizations, the lion’s 
share of closure tasks is largely done by the project office in coordination with the 
project manager. The final report writing is usually assigned to one project office 
staff member, who assembles input from all stakeholders. In smaller organizations 
and projects, these closure activities are left to the project manager and team.
2. Project audit. Audits are post-project reviews of how successful the project was. 
They include causal analysis and thorough retrospectives that identify lessons 
learned. These post-project reviews should be held with the team and key stake￾holders to catch any missing issues or gaps.

3. Evaluation of performance and management of the project. Evaluation includes 
the team, individual team members, and project manager performance. Vendors 
and the customer may provide external input. Evaluation of the major players pro￾vides important information for the future.
This chapter begins with the recognition that projects are shut down for many rea￾sons. Not all projects end with a clear “Finished” and are turned over to a customer. 
Regardless of the conditions for ending a project, the general process of closure is 
similar for all projects, though the endings may differ significantly. Wrap-up closure 
tasks are noted first. These tasks represent all the tasks that must be “cleaned up” 
before the project is terminated. Project audits and lessons learned are examined next. 
Finally, evaluation of individual and team performance is discussed.
14.1 Types of Project Closure
On some projects, the end may not be as clear as would be hoped. Although the scope 
statement may define a clear ending for a project, the actual ending may or may not 
correspond. Fortunately, a majority of projects are blessed with a well-defined ending. 
Regular project reviews will identify projects having endings different from plans. 
Following are the types of closure.
∙ Normal. The most common circumstance for project closure is simply a completed 
project. For many development projects, the end involves handing off the final design 
to Production and creating a new product or service line. For other internal IT proj￾ects, such as system upgrades or the creation of new inventory control systems, the 
end occurs when the output is incorporated into ongoing operations. Some modifica￾tions in scope, cost, and schedule probably occurred during implementation.
∙ Premature. For a few projects, the project may be completed early with some parts 
of the project eliminated. For example, in a new product development project, a 
marketing manager may insist on production models before testing:
 “Give the new product to me now, the way it is. Early entry into the market will 
mean big profits! I know we can sell a bazillion of these. If we don’t do it now, the 
opportunity is lost!”
 The pressure is on to finish the project and send it to Production. Before succumb￾ing to this form of pressure, the implications and risks associated with this decision 
should be carefully reviewed and assessed by senior management and all stakehold￾ers. Too frequently, the benefits are illusory and dangerous, and carry large risks.

∙ Perpetual. Some projects never seem to end. The major characteristic of this kind 
of project is constant “add-ons,” suggesting a poorly conceived project scope. For 
example, in 1984 President Ronald Reagan launched the Strategic Defense Initiative 
(SDI). Over 30 years later, many of the technical difficulties with creating a “Star 
Wars” defense system are still being addressed. Most experts admit they do not have 
a good idea when such a system would be sufficiently robust to be deployed. At some 
point, the review group should recommend methods for bringing final closure to this 
type of project or the initiation of another project. For example, adding a new feature 
to an old project could replace a segment of a project that appears to be perpetual.
∙ Failed project. Many projects fail because of circumstances beyond the control 
of the project team. Failed projects are easy to identify after the fact. The machine 
does not work, the customer rejects our work, or the costs greatly exceed the ben￾efits. Recognizing danger signals and shutting down doom projects in advance can 
be much more problematic. See the Research Highlight 14.1: Why is it difficult to 
pull the plug on projects?
∙ Changed priority. Organizations’ priorities often change and strategies shift direc￾tions. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic shook operations around the world 
and companies were forced to cancel projects and redirect efforts to face new chal￾lenges. Thus, a project may start with a high priority but see its rank erode or crash 
during its project life cycle as conditions change. When priorities change, projects 
in the process may need to be altered or canceled. See Snapshot from Practice 14.1: 
The Wake for a novel response to a canceled project.
Different types of project termination present unique issues. Some adjustments to 
generic closure processes may be necessary to accommodate the type of project ter￾mination you face.
Sally worked as a project manager 
for a high-tech electronics firm in the 
late 1980s. The company was using 
“bubble ink” technology to develop 
affordable color printers.
Sally was in charge of a team tasked with cut￾ting the prohibitive cost of printers in half. If success￾ful, significant bonuses would be earned and several 
team members would be given key positions when the 
product went into production. The team had overcome 
several difficult technical challenges and was well on 
its way to accomplishing its objective when the project 
was canceled. Top management discovered at a trade 
show that several competitors were about to introduce 
ink jet printers at a cost one-third the price of printers 
Sally’s team was developing.
What could Sally say to her team? They had worked 
so hard, and expected so much out of this project. She 
knew they would be devastated.
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 14.1 The Wake1
Sally knew she had to do something to help her 
team deal with this bitter disappointment. So she 
decided to hold a traditional Irish “wake” for the proj￾ect. She persuaded management to hire a backhoe to 
dig a grave in the backyard of their office and purchase 
an actual coffin. After she and the other members 
gave a brief eulogy about the project, each member 
dropped something from the project into the coffin. For 
some members, it was a piece of a printer prototype; 
for others, it was a memo or a plan. One by one, each 
member put something personal in the coffin. After the 
coffin was buried, the team retreated to a local brew 
pub to imbibe, cry, and share fond memories of the 
work they had accomplished.
The “wake” became part of the company’s folklore 
and team members still laugh about the experience.

 A wake is a party in honor of the deceased that usually 
involves the consumption of alcohol.

Barry Staw and his colleagues have 
conducted research directed at 
answering the question why people 
continue to pursue a failed coursed 
of action. Why do people continue 
to work at jobs that make them 
unhappy? Or, why do organizations continue to 
fund bad projects? Their research centers around 
the concept escalation of commitment.
Escalation of commitment is a human behav￾ior pattern in which an individual or group facing 
increasingly negative outcomes from a decision, 
action, or investment, nevertheless, continues the 
behavior instead of altering course (Staw, 1997).
Through a series of laboratory and field stud￾ies, researchers have confirmed that the more 
people become invested in a project, the less 
willing they are to abandon it despite increasingly 
negative results. This investment may be tan￾gible and psychological. Tangible costs include 
time and resources already spent on the project. 
“Sunk costs” refers to investment in a project 
that is not recoverable. Sunk costs are reflected 
in a project’s salvage value and closing costs. An 
executive could simply terminate an ineffective 
advertising campaign in midstream, but stopping 
work on a half-built apartment complex is another 
story. A project that has very little salvage value 
and high closing costs—payments to terminated 
employees, penalties for breached contracts, and 
losses from the closing of facilities—will be much 
more difficult to abandon than a project in which 
expenditures are recoverable and exit is easy.
The problem is many projects are often 
structured in ways to ensure commitment. First, 
project managers tend to view each setback as 
temporary that can be correctable over time with 
more money and effort. Second, they consider all 
money spent as investments toward a large pay￾off they can reap once the project is completed. 
Third, expenditures as noted earlier are sunk 
costs and non recoverable if the project is shut 
down. Sometimes project managers and support￾ers will feel backed into a corner and perceive 
they have no alternative but to see the project 
through.
Staw and colleagues research delved deeper 
into the question and discovered more subtle, 
psychological forces at play. One is the need for 
self-justification, that managers sometimes are 
unwilling to pull the plug on a project because 
they consider it a personal failure. People natu￾rally wish to preserve their sense of self-esteem, 
and when threatened they will continue a project 
to prove they were right.
Social pressures also come into play. Few 
like to expose their mistakes to others. No one 
wants to appear incompetent. When a person’s 
status is tied to a project’s success and accept￾ing failure means loss of reputation and even 
job insecurity, hanging on despite losses makes 
some sense.
Finally, Staw pointed out that cultural norms 
often come into play. “Stay the course,” “Failure 
is opportunity,” “Stick to your guns” are leader￾ship axioms often embedded in an organization’s 
culture. While often leading to dramatic results, 
they can also encourage foolish persistence. 
Staw warned that organizations can become 
“programmed” to escalate commitment.
Escalating commitment has been attributed to 
many failures including the 1996 Mount Everest 
disaster (Alvarez et al., 2011), the Big Dig, aka the 
exorbitantly over-budgeted Boston Transit project 
(Sleesman et al., 2012), the continuation of the 
Vietnam War/Kháng chiến chống Mỹ (Staw, 1981), 
and Sony’s continued investment in electronics 
business after $8.5 billion in losses (Woods et al., 
2012). It would not be surprising to find many 
failed project postmortems identifying escalation 
of commitment as a significant factor behind obvi￾ous warning signals being ignored.
So, what can one do?
The most important thing for project manag￾ers to realize is that they may be biased toward 
escalation. For all the reasons mentioned, project 
managers often delude themselves into thinking 
that the project will pull through. A second impor￾tant action is that organizations should separate 
the decision makers who approve projects from 
those professionals who assess progress of the 
projects (remember Gate 5 in Figure 2.3). Inde￾pendence is key to providing a less bias more 
objective assessment. Finally, leaders need to 
assess the role their organization’s culture plays. 
Do the heroes always encourage a “go for broke 
attitude,” or do they recognize that it may take 
even more courage and loyalty to admit failure 
and cut losses?

14.2 Wrap-up Closure Activities
The major challenges for the project manager and team members are over. Getting the 
project manager and project participants to wrap up the odds and ends necessary to fully 
complete a project is often difficult. It’s like the party is over—now who wants to help 
clean up? Much of the work is mundane and tedious. Motivation can be the chief chal￾lenge. For example, accounting for equipment and completing final reports are perceived 
as dull administrative tasks by project professionals who are action-oriented individuals.
The project manager’s challenge is to keep the project team focused on the remain￾ing project activities and delivery to the customer until the project is complete. Com￾municating a closure and review plan and schedule early allows the project team to (1) 
accept the psychological fact the project will end and (2) prepare to move on. The ideal 
scenario is to have each team member’s next assignment ready when project comple￾tion is announced. Project managers need to be careful to maintain their enthusiasm 
for completing the project and hold people accountable to deadlines, which are prone 
to slip during the waning stages of the project.
Project closure usually includes the following six major activities.
1. Getting delivery acceptance from the customer.
2. Shutting down resources and releasing to new uses.
3. Reassigning project team members.
4. Closing accounts and seeing that all bills are paid.
5. Delivering the project to the customer.
6. Creating a final report.
Administering the details of closing out a project can be intimidating. Some organi￾zations have checklists of over 100 wrap-up tasks! These checklists deal with closure 
details such as facilities, teams, staff, customer, vendors, and the project itself. A par￾tial administrative closure checklist is shown in Table 14.1.
Getting delivery acceptance by the customer is a major and critical closure activity. 
Delivery of some projects to the customer is straightforward. Others are more complex 
and difficult. Ideally, there should be no surprises. This requires a well-defined scope 
and an effective change management system with active customer involvement. User 
involvement is critical to acceptance (see Snapshot from Practice 14.2: New Ball Goes 
Flat in the NBA).
Project managers are not always responsible for all facets of the closeout process. 
In many organizations, accounts and bills are dealt with by contract offices. Reassign￾ments are managed by the firm’s project management office. Disputes are dealt with 
by lawyers. Sometimes new managers are brought in to close out the project. They 
specialize in customer relations and/or attention to detail and are often called “termi￾nators” within their organization.
The conditions for completing and transferring the project should be set before the 
project begins. A completed software project is a good example of the need to work 
out the details in advance. If the user has problems using the software, will the cus￾tomer withhold final payments? Who is responsible for supporting and training the 
user? If these conditions are not clearly defined up front, getting delivery acceptance 
can be troublesome.
Another delivery tactic (briefly mentioned in Chapter 7) for a project that has been 
outsourced is known as build, own, operate, and transfer (BOOT). In this type of proj￾ect, the contractor builds, owns, and operates the project deliverable for a set period of 
time. For example, Haliburton will operate a hydroelectric plant for six months before

turning over operations to their Indian counterparts. During this time all the bugs are 
worked out and conditions for delivery are satisfied. Again, the delivery conditions 
need to be carefully set up before the project begins; if not, wrap-up activities can 
develop a life of their own.
Releasing the project team typically occurs gradually during the closure phase. For 
some people, the termination of their responsible activities ends before the project is 
delivered to the customer or user. Reassignment for these participants needs to take place 
well before the final finish date. For the remaining team members (full or part-time), 
termination may result in a new project or a return to their functional job. Sometimes, 
in product development efforts, team members are assigned to operations positions and 
play an active role in the production of the new product. For contract people it may mean 
the end of their assignment to that project; in some cases, there may be follow-up work 
or user support possibilities. A small number of part-time participants may be recom￾mended to the user organization to train users or operate new equipment or systems.
Since many work invoices are not submitted until after the project is officially over, 
closing out contracts is often messy and filled with untied ends. For example, it is 
improbable that all invoices have been finalized, billed, and paid. Further, when con￾tractors are used, there is a need to verify that all the contracted work has been done. 
Keeping contract records, such as progress reports, invoices, change records, and pay￾ment records, is important, should a compliance or lawsuit occur. Too often in the 
haste to meet deadlines, paperwork and recordkeeping get short-changed, only to cre￾ate major headaches when it comes time for final documentation.
There are many more wrap-up activities; it is important to complete all of them. 
Experience has proved time and again that not doing all the little cleanup tasks well

On October 31, 2006, the National 
Basketball Association (NBA) opened 
its 57th season with new official 
game balls. The new ball, manu￾factured by Spalding, featured a 
new design and a new material that together were 
believed to offer better grip, feel, and consistency 
than the previous leather ball. The material was a 
microfiber composite with moisture management 
that provided superior grip and feel throughout the 
course of a game. Additionally, the new composite 
material eliminated the need for a break-in period, 
which is necessary for a leather ball, and achieved 
consistency from ball to ball.
The NBA and Spalding subjected the ball to a 
rigorous evaluation process that included a labora￾tory and on-court testing process. Every NBA team 
received the new ball and had the opportunity to 
use it in practice. The ball was also tested in the 
NBA summer development league.
At the press conference announcing the shift 
from leather to microfiber balls, NBA commissioner 
David Stern pronounced, “The advancement that 
Spalding has made to the new game ball ensures 
that the best basketball players in the world will be 
playing with the best basketball in the world.”
Animal rights advocates applauded the shift 
from leather to microfiber. Such was not the case 
for the players who would actually use the new 
ball. Grumblings emerged immediately when train￾ing camps opened in October. Washington Wizards 
guard Gilbert Arenas said the new basketball “got 
slippery” when it came in contact with even small 
amounts of sweat. Then Miami Heat center Sha￾quille O’Neil said, “It feels like one of those cheap 
balls that you buy at a toy store.”
Some players, including league MVP Steve 
Nash, began complaining that the new ball was pro￾ducing small cuts on their hands. “It’s awful [the fric￾tion burns], it’s like an irritant . . . sometimes I even 
have to tape my fingers in practice.” Perhaps LeBron 
James from the Cleveland Cavaliers best summed 
up the players’ attitudes toward the NBA’s introduc￾tion of the new ball when he said, “You can change 
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 14.2 New Ball Goes Flat in the NBA*
the dress code, you can make our shorts shorter, but 
when you take our basketball away from us, that’s 
not a transition we can handle.”
On December 1, 2006, four weeks into the sea￾son, the NBA players union filed an unfair labor prac￾tice suit because the league management switched 
to the new ball without consulting the players. Ten 
days later, the NBA announced that they would 
revert to the old leather ball beginning January 1, 
2007. In a terse statement, Commissioner David 
Stern said, “Our players’ response to this particular 
composite ball has been overwhelmingly negative 
and we are acting accordingly.”
The failure to check with the players (the end 
users) and get buy-in for the new basketball was 
loudly criticized by the press. “How they could 
actually even get it that far and not have run it by 
the players is just an amazing, amazing exercise 
in ineptitude,” Rob Frankel, a Los Angeles–based 
branding expert, told Bloomberg News.

will create problems later. Appendix 14.1 presents an example of a closeout checklist 
used by the state of Virginia.
A final wrap-up activity is some form of celebration. For successful projects, an 
upbeat, festive celebration brings closure to the enjoyable experiences everyone has 
had and the need to say goodbye. Celebration is an opportunity to recognize the effort 
Final PDF to printerChapter 14 Project Closure 551

project stakeholders contributed. Even if the project did not reach its objectives, recog￾nize the effort involved and goals that were achieved. If the project was a success, invite 
everyone who in some way contributed to the project success. Thank the team and 
each one individually. The spirit of the celebration should be one in which stakehold￾ers are thanked for a job well done and leave with a good feeling of accomplishment.
14.3 Project Audits
Project audits are more than the status reports suggested in Chapter 13, which report 
on project performance. While project audits do use performance measures, they are 
more inclusive. Project audits not only examine project success but also review why 
the project was selected. Project audits include a reassessment of the project’s role 
in the organization’s priorities and a check on the organizational culture to ensure 
it facilitates the type of project being implemented. They assess if the project team 
is functioning well and is appropriately staffed. Audits make recommendations and 
articulate lessons learned.
Project audits can be performed while a project is in process and after a project is 
completed. There are only two minor differences between these audits:
∙ In-process project audits. Project audits early in projects allow for corrective 
changes, if they are needed, on the audited project or others in progress. In-process 
project audits concentrate on project progress and performance and check if condi￾tions have changed. For example, have priorities changed? Is the project mission 
still relevant? In some cases, the audit report may recommend shutting down the 
project or significantly changing the scope of the project.
∙ Post-project audits. These audits tend to include more detail and depth than in￾process project audits. Project audits of completed projects emphasize improving 
the management of future projects. These audits are more long-term oriented than 
in-process audits. Post-project audits do check on project performance, but the audit 
represents a broader view of the project’s role in the organization; for example, 
were the strategic benefits claimed actually delivered?
The depth and detail of the project audit depend on many factors. Some are listed 
in Table 14.1. Because audits cost time and money, they should include no more time 
or resources than are necessary and sufficient. Early in-process project audits tend to 
be perfunctory unless serious problems or concerns are identified. Then, of course, 
the audit would be carried out in more detail. Because in-process project audits can be 
worrisome and destructive to the project team, care must be taken to protect project 
team morale. The audit should be carried out quickly, and the report should be as posi￾tive and constructive as possible. Post-project audits are more detailed and inclusive 
and contain more project team input.
In summary, plan the audit and limit the time for the audit. For example, in post￾project audits, for all but very large projects, a one-week limit is a good benchmark. 
Beyond this time, the marginal return of additional information diminishes quickly. 
Small projects may require only one or two days and one or two people to conduct 
an audit.
The priority team functions well in selecting projects and monitoring performance—
cost and time. However, reviewing and evaluating projects and the process of manag￾ing projects are usually delegated to independent audit groups. Each audit group is 
charged with evaluating and reviewing all factors relevant to the project and to manag￾ing future projects. The outcome of the project audit is a report.

The Project Audit Process
The following guidelines, which should be noted before conducting a major project 
audit, will improve your chances for a successful audit.
1. Comments about individuals or groups participating in the project should be mini￾mized. Keep to project issues, not what happened or who did what.
2. Audit activities should be intensely sensitive to human emotions and reactions. The 
inherent threat to those being evaluated should be reduced as much as possible.
3. The accuracy of data should be verifiable or noted as subjective, judgmental, or hearsay.
4. Senior management should announce support for the project audit and see that the 
audit group has access to all information, project participants, and (in most cases) 
project customers.
5. The attitude toward a project audit and its aftermath depends on the modus operandi 
of the audit leadership and group. The objective is not to prosecute. The objective is 
to learn and conserve valuable organizational resources where mistakes have been 
made, learn and elevate future performance when people have succeeded. Friendli￾ness, empathy, and objectivity encourage cooperation and reduce anxiety.
6. The audit should be completed as quickly as is reasonable.
With these guidelines in mind, the project audit process is conveniently divided into 
three steps: initiation and staffing, data collection and analysis, and reporting. Each 
step is briefly discussed next.
Step 1: Initiation and Staffing
Initiation of the audit process depends primarily on organization size and project size, 
along with other factors. In small organizations and projects where face-to-face con￾tact at all levels is prevalent, an audit may be informal and represent only another staff 
meeting. But even in these environments the content of a formal project audit should 
be examined and covered, with notes made of the lessons learned. In medium-sized 
organizations with few projects, the audit is likely to be conducted by someone from 
management with project management experience. In large companies or organiza￾tions with many projects, the audit is under the purview of the project office.
A major tenet of the project audit is that the outcome must represent an independent 
view of the project. Maintaining independence and an objective view is difficult, given 
that project stakeholders frequently view audits as negative. Careers and reputations 
can be tarnished, even in organizations that tolerate mistakes. In less forgiving orga￾nizations, mistakes can lead to termination or exile to less significant regions of an 
organization. Of course, if the result of an audit is favorable, careers and reputations 
can be enhanced. Given that project audits are susceptible to internal politics, some 
organizations rely on outside consulting firms to conduct the audits.
Step 2: Data Collection and Analysis
Each organization and project is unique. Therefore, the specific kinds of information 
that will be collected depending upon the industry, project size, newness of technol￾ogy, and project experience. These factors can influence the nature of the audit. How￾ever, information and data are gathered to answer questions similar to the following.
Organization View
1. Was the organizational culture supportive and correct for this type of project? Why? 
Why not?
2. Was senior management’s support adequate?
Final PDF to printerChapter 14 Project Closure 553
lar60886_ch14_543-572.indd 553 10/14/23 12:00 pm
3. Did the project accomplish its intended purpose?
4. Were the risks for the project appropriately identified and assessed? Were con￾tingency plans used? Were they realistic? Have risk events occurred that have an 
impact greater than anticipated?
5. Were the right people and talents assigned to this project?
6. What does evaluation from outside contractors suggest?
7. Were the project start-up and hand-off successful? Why? Is the customer 
satisfied?
Project Team View
1. Were the project planning and control systems appropriate for this type of proj￾ect? Should all projects of a similar size and type use these systems? Why or 
why not?
2. Did the project conform to plan? Is the project over or under budget and schedule? 
Why?
3. Were interfaces and communications with project stakeholders adequate and 
effective?
4. Did the team have adequate access to organizational resources—people, budget, 
support groups, equipment? Were there resource conflicts with other ongoing 
projects?
5. Was the team managed well? Were problems confronted, not avoided?
The audit group should not be limited to these questions but rather should include 
other questions related to their organization and project type—for example, research 
and development, marketing, information systems, construction, or facilities. The pre￾ceding generic questions, although overlapping, represent a good starting point and 
will go a long way toward identifying project problem and success patterns.
Step 3: Reporting
The major goal of the audit report is to improve the way future projects are managed. 
Succinctly, the report attempts to capture needed changes and lessons learned from a 
current or finished project. The report serves as a training instrument for project man￾agers of future projects.
Audit reports need to be tailored to the specific project and organizational envi￾ronment. Nevertheless, a generic format for all audits facilitates the development of 
an audit database and a common outline for those who prepare audit reports and the 
managers who read and act on their content. A very general outline common to those 
found in practice is as follows:
1. Classification. The classification of projects by characteristics allows prospective 
readers and project managers to be selective in the use of the report content. Typical 
classification categories include the following:
∙ Project type—for example, development, marketing, systems, construction.
∙ Size—monetary.
∙ Number of staff.
∙ Technology level—low, medium, high, new.
∙ Strategic or support.
Other classifications relevant to the organization should be included.

2. Analysis. The analysis section includes succinct, factual review statements of the 
project (PMBOK, 2017)—for example,
∙ Scope objectives, the criteria used to evaluate scope and evidence that the comple￾tion criteria were met.
∙ Quality objectives, the criteria used to assess the project and product/service qual￾ity, and reasons for variances.
∙ Cost objectives, including acceptable cost range, actual costs, and reasons for any 
variances.
∙ Schedule objectives, including verification of milestone completion dates, and rea￾sons for variances.
∙ Summary of risks and issues encountered on the project and how they were 
addressed.
∙ Outcomes achieved, including an assessment of how the final product, service, or 
result addressed the business need identified in the selection process.
3. Recommendations. Usually, audit recommendations represent major corrective 
actions that should take place. Audit recommendations are often technical and focus 
on solutions to problems that surfaced. For example, to avoid rework, the report of a 
construction project recommended shifting to a more resilient building material. In 
other cases, recommendations may include terminating or sustaining vendor or con￾tractor relationships.
4. Lessons learned. These do not have to be in the form of recommendations. 
Lessons learned serve as reminders of mistakes easily avoided and actions easily 
taken to ensure success. In practice, new project teams reviewing audits of past proj￾ects similar to the one they are about to start have found audit reports very useful. 
Team members will frequently remark later, “The recommendations were good, but 
the ‘lessons learned’ section really helped us avoid many pitfalls and made our project 
implementation smoother.” It is precisely for this reason that lessons learned in the 
form of project retrospectives have taken on greater prominence and warrant further 
discussion. See Snapshot from Practice 14.3: Operation Eagle Claw.

critical, pertinent information should be attached.
Project Retrospectives
The term retrospective has emerged to denote specific efforts at identifying lessons 
learned on projects. Proponents believe that the traditional audit process focuses too 
much on project success and evaluation, which interferes with the surfacing and trans￾feral of important lessons learned. They advocate a separate effort toward capturing 
lessons learned. In many ways, this effort mirrors the auditing process.
Retrospectives vary depending upon the nature of the project, the number of people 
involved, and the difficulties experienced on a project. On large projects, this would 
be broken down into relevant teams and management groups. They should include 
relevant contractors, owners, and other external stakeholders. If these people are not 
available, then their input should be sought via email or a virtual meeting.
All retrospectives boil down to a small group of people getting together to discuss and 
identify lessons learned from working on the project together. Focus should not only be

on technical lessons (i.e., next time we can skip steps 2–3 and go immediately to step 4) 
but also on working together issues, such as tech leads need to talk daily to make sure 
that they are on the same page during the development phase, should be discussed.
In many cases, professionals from the project office are assigned to facilitate the 
retrospective. This is especially true on controversial projects where there is likely to 
be a hesitancy in sharing information. Here, trained facilitators collect information 
On November 4, 1979, a mob in 
Iran stormed the U.S. Embassy and 
took 52 Americans hostage. After 
six months of failed negotiation, the 
green light was given to execute 
Operation Eagle Claw, a joint military effort to free 
the hostages.
The plan called for eight Navy RH-53D heli￾copters to fly 600 miles to a remote site in Iran, 
code-named Desert One. Under the cover of dark￾ness, the helicopters would be refueled by KC-130 
tankers. The helicopters would then fly the assault 
force to a spot near the outskirts of Tehran, where 
they would meet up with special agents already in 
the country. The agents would lead them to a safe 
house to await the assault on the embassy the next 
night. Upon rescuing the hostages, the assault team 
would escort them to a nearby airfield that had 
already been secured by a second assault team, 
where they would be flown to safety.
What actually happened was far different from 
what was planned.
The helicopter pilots were ordered to fly at or 
below 200 feet to avoid radar. This caused them 
to run into “haboobs,” or dust storms. Two helicop￾ters malfunctioned and turned back. The remainder 
battled the dust storms and arrived at Desert One 
one hour late. The rescue attempt was dealt its final 
blow when it was discovered that a third helicopter 
had a hydraulic leak and was inoperable. Only five 
aircraft were serviceable and six were needed, so 
the mission had to be aborted. Things got worse 
when one of the helicopters moved into position to 
refuel and collided with a KC-130 plane. Both air￾craft burst into flames. All told, eight soldiers died 
and dozens were injured. The Iranians scattered the 
hostages around the country afterward, making any 
further rescue attempts impossible.
Given the gravity of the situation, a special six￾member commission was appointed by the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff to conduct an audit of the project. 
They identified a number of issues that contrib￾uted to the failure. One issue was the selection 
of the aircrews. Given the significance of the mis￾sion, each military service wanted to be involved. 
Navy and Marine pilots with little experience 
in long-range overland navigation or refueling 
were chosen, even though more than 100 expe￾rienced Air Force pilots were available. Another 
issue was the lack of a comprehensive mission 
rehearsal program. From the beginning, training 
was not conducted in a truly joint manner; it was 
compartmentalized by service and held in differ￾ent locations across the United States. The limited 
rehearsals that were conducted assessed only 
segments of the total mission.
The commission concluded that 10 and perhaps 
12 helicopters should have been launched to guar￾antee the minimum of 6 required for mission com￾pletion. Finally, the hopscotch method for ground 
refueling was criticized. If planners had chosen 
en-route fueling, the entire Desert One scenario 
could have been avoided. The final report contained 
several important lessons learned that have contrib￾uted to subsequent successful missions, including 
the one against Osama bin Laden in 2011.

from interviews and survey data to identify relevant learning opportunities. They then 
lead the group involved in a discussion of the results and identification of key les￾sons to be learned. For example, one of the issues identified was a lack of timely 
decision making and poor coordination between the project team and external groups 
(i.e., Human Resources (HR), Production, etc.). Through frank discussion, members 
felt they were getting bombarded with useless information all of the time and they 
had a hard time sorting through what was important and what could be ignored. A 
couple of the team members admitted to doing a core dump of all HR e-mails out of 
frustration. HR and Production admitted that they sometimes felt safer “cc-ing” every￾one. Two lessons identified from the discussion included (1) more attention should be 
devoted when developing the communication plan to carefully delineate who should 
get what information and (2) two months into a project, whether through an email 
survey or discussion, the quality and frequency of information exchange should be 
assessed, and changes made, when necessary.
Even if a project doesn’t warrant an outside facilitator, every project manager should 
take responsibility to see that their project team conducts a retrospective. In fact, no 
project is complete no matter how small or large without project retrospective taking 
place. One can simply request that team members submit anonymously responses to 
three simple questions:
1. What did we do well as a team?
2. What didn’t we do well as a team?
3. If you had to do it all over again, what should you/we have done differently?
The project manager reports back their responses and leads the group in a discus￾sion of problems, opportunities, and underlying causes. One would be amazed by the 
richness of the learning that comes from a discussion.
Such discussions depend upon the level of trust members have in their project man￾ager. Where the threat of mistrust is high, then we would strongly recommend that an 
outside facilitator be used to conduct the retrospective. Even when trust is high, it is 
wise to work with a trained facilitator the first time you conduct a retrospective.
Each lesson is assigned an owner, typically a team member who is very interested 
in and familiar with the lesson. This team member/owner will serve as a contact point 
for anyone needing information (expertise, contacts, templates, etc.) relating to the 
lesson. This person often reports lessons learned to larger audiences within their orga￾nization that would benefit from the collective wisdom.
Not only is there a contact person but also lessons learned need to be documented 
and archived in a manner that makes them accessible to and usable by others. Many 
organizations have created lessons learned repositories that store historical informa￾tion. These repositories use sophisticated search engines that permit others to quickly 
sort through and access lessons specific to their needs. Failure to do so will produce a 
system that is undervalued and underutilized.
14.4 Project Audits: The Big Picture
Project audits and/or retrospectives can yield valuable lessons and recommenda￾tions that team members can apply to future project work. When done on a consis￾tent basis, they can lead to significant improvements in the processes and techniques 
that organizations use to complete projects. A more encompassing look from an

organization-wide point of view is to use a project maturity model. The purposes 
of all maturity models (and there are many available) are to enable organizations to 
assess their progress in implementing the best practices in their industry and move to 
improvement. It is important to understand that the model does not ensure success; it 
only serves as a measuring stick and an indicator of progress.
The term maturity model was coined in the late 1980s from a research study by the 
U.S. government and the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon 
University. The government wanted a tool to predict successful software development 
by contractors. The eventual outcome of this research was the Capability Maturity 
Model Integration (CMMI). The model focuses on guiding and assessing organiza￾tions in implementing concrete best practices in managing software development proj￾ects. Since its development, different project maturity models have emerged across 
industries.
In January 2004, after eight years of development, the Project Management Insti￾tute rolled out its second version of the Organizational Project Maturity Model. The 
latest version is called OPM3TM. Typically these models are divided into a continuum 
of growth levels: Initial, Repeatable, Defined, Managed, and Optimized. Figure 14.2 
presents one version that borrows liberally from other models, focusing less on a pro￾cess and more on the state an organization has evolved to in managing projects.
Level 1: Ad Hoc Project Management
No consistent project management process is in place. How a project is managed 
depends upon the individuals involved. Characteristics of this level include
∙ No formal project selection system exists—projects are done because people decide 
to do them or because a high-ranking manager orders them done.
∙ How any one project is managed varies by individual—unpredictability.
∙ No investment in project management training is made.
∙ Working on projects is a struggle because it goes against the grain of established 
policies and procedures.

Level 2: Formal Application of Project Management
The organization applies established project management procedures and techniques. 
This level is often marked by tension between project managers and line managers, 
who need to redefine their roles. Features of this level include
∙ Standard approaches to managing projects, including scope statements, WBS, and 
activity lists, are used.
∙ Quality emphasis is on the product or outcome of the project and is inspected 
instead of built-in.
∙ The organization is moving in the direction of the stronger matrix with project man￾agers and line managers working out their respective roles.
∙ Growing recognition of need for cost control, not just scope and time management, 
exists.
∙ There is no formal project priority system established.
∙ Limited training in project management is provided.
Level 3: Institutionalization of Project Management
An organization-wide project management system, tailored to specific needs of the 
organization with the flexibility to adapt the process to unique characteristics of the 
project, is established. Characteristics of this level include
∙ An established process for managing projects is evident by planning templates, 
status report systems, and checklists for each stage of the project life cycle.
∙ Formal criteria are used to select projects.
∙ Project management is integrated with quality management and concurrent engineering.
∙ Project teams try to build in quality, not simply inspect it.
∙ The organization is moving toward a team-based reward system to recognize proj￾ect execution.
∙ Risk assessment derived from WBS and technical analyses and customer input is in 
place.
∙ The organization offers expanded training in project management.
∙ Time-phased budgets are used to measure and monitor performance based on 
earned value analysis.
∙ A specific change control system for requirements, cost, and schedule is developed 
for each project, and a work authorization system is in place.
∙ Project audits tend to be performed only when a project fails.
Level 4: Management of Project Management System
The organization develops a system for managing multiple projects that are aligned 
with the strategic goals of the organization. Characteristics of this level include
∙ Portfolio project management is practiced; projects are selected based on resource 
capacity and contribution to strategic goals.
∙ A project priority system is established.
∙ Project work is integrated with ongoing operations.
∙ Quality improvement initiatives are designed to improve both the quality of the 
project management process and the quality of specific products and services.
Final PDF to printerChapter 14 Project Closure 559
lar60886_ch14_543-572.indd 559 10/14/23 12:00 pm
∙ Benchmarking is used to identify opportunities for improvement.
∙ The organization has established a project management office or center for 
excellence.
∙ Project audits are performed on all significant projects; lessons learned are recorded 
and used on subsequent projects.
∙ An integrative information system is established for tracking resource usage and 
performance of all significant projects.
Level 5: Optimization of Project Management System
The focus is on continuous improvement through incremental advancements of 
existing practices and by innovations using new technologies and methods. Fea￾tures include
∙ A project management information system is fine-tuned; specific and aggregate 
information is provided to different stakeholders.
∙ An informal culture that values improvement drives the organization, not policies 
and procedures.
∙ There is greater flexibility in tailoring the project management process to the 
demands of a specific project.
A major theme of this book is that the culture of the organization has a profound 
impact on how project management methodology operates. Audits and performance 
evaluations require informed judgment. Good decision making depends not only on 
the accuracy of the information but also on the right information. For example, imag￾ine how much different your response could be if you made an honest mistake but 
did not trust management and felt insecure versus if you had confidence and trust in 
management. Or think how different the quality of the information that would surface 
from a team would be where trust was divided versus a team that works in a Level 5 
environment.
Progress from one level to the next will not occur overnight. The Software Engi￾neering Institute estimates the following median times for movement:
Maturity level 1 to 2 is 22 months.
Maturity level 2 to 3 is 19 months.
Maturity level 3 to 4 is 25 months.
Maturity level 4 to 5 is 13 months.
Why does it take so long? One reason is simply organizational inertia. It is diffi￾cult for social organizations to institute significant changes while maintaining business 
efficacy: “How do we find time to change when we are so busy just keeping our heads 
above water?”
A second significant reason is that one cannot leapfrog past any one level. Just 
as children cannot avoid the trials and tribulations of being teenagers by adopting 
all the lessons learned by their parents, people within the organization have to work 
through the unique challenges and problems of each level to get to the next level. 
Learning of this magnitude naturally takes time and cannot be avoided by using 
quick fixes or simple remedies. See Snapshot from Practice 14.4: 2015 PMO of the 
Year for how a PMO improved the maturity of project management operations at a 
large credit union.

14.5 Post-implementation Evaluation
The purpose of project evaluation is to assess how well the project team, team mem￾bers, and project manager performed.
Team Evaluation
Evaluation of performance is essential to encourage changes in behavior and to sup￾port individual career development. Evaluation implies measurement against specific 
criteria. Experience corroborates that before the commencement of a project, the stage 
must be set so expectations, standards, supportive organizational culture, and con￾straints are in place; if not, the effectiveness of the evaluation process will suffer.
Evaluation of project team performance tends to be based on achieving project 
objectives according to time, cost, and specifications (scope). It has become more 
common to add customer/end user satisfaction to the assessment. After all, many 
argue that the most important indicator of project success is customer satisfaction.
Less common is assessing how well the team worked together and with others. 
Remember, projects are socio-technical endeavors, and the human dimension should 
be evaluated along with the technical dimension. Take, for example, a project that was 
a technical success but emotions and tempers flared toward the end, leaving people 
swearing they would never work with each other again. Or consider a successful proj￾ect in which over half of the team was so burned out by the long hours and stress they 
eventually left the company. Another alternative is an unsuccessful project on which,

Like many financial institutions, the 
Navy Federal Credit Union struggled 
with adapting IT technologies to bet￾ter serve their over 5 million mem￾bers. Navy Federal had no clear 
method of prioritizing projects. Project execution 
processes were ad hoc. Delivery metrics weren’t 
being tracked. Doomed projects lingered, with no 
one willing to hit the kill button.
In 2010 things began to change. Navy Federal 
began developing a team of project professionals 
who could advocate a standardized project delivery 
system as well as strategic alignment practices. In 
2014 the IT Department opened its project manage￾ment office (PMO). The office was not greeted with 
open arms. The team had to work hard to avoid the 
perception that it was a document engine or need￾less bureaucracy.
“Throughout our journey, we’ve certainly 
faced challenges in terms of buy-in and accep￾tance of project management,” says Kristin Ear￾ley, PMP, assistant vice president of the PMO. “We 
started with small wins. We had to highlight the 
demonstrated value that we brought in terms of 
consistent, repeatable delivery of projects.”
The impact has been significant. The percentage 
of projects that closed according to plan jumped from 
55 percent in 2014 to 88 percent in 2015. The PMO 
is now considered an integral part of how Navy Fed￾eral does business and was recognized by the Project 
Management Institute as 2015 PMO of the year.
While the initial push was to standardize project 
management processes, the PMO realized that not 
all projects are alike and some may benefit from 
less traditional methods.
“The PMO started with a one-size-fits-all 
approach to project delivery. We realized this really 
wasn’t the most effective way to work with our busi￾ness partners to deliver value frequently throughout 
the project life cycle,” Earley says. “We’ve tailored 
our delivery practices to introduce both agile and 
incremental delivery practices, and that’s helped us 
improve our delivery within the portfolio.”

on closer examination, the team should be applauded for achieving what they did, 
given the hurdles they faced. Important knowledge can be obtained by looking at the 
underlying behavioral dynamics of a project.
In practice, the team evaluation process takes many forms—especially when eval￾uation goes beyond time, budget, and specifications. The typical mechanism for evalu￾ating teams is a survey administered by a consultant, a staff member from the Human 
Resources Department, or email. The survey is normally restricted to team members, 
but in some cases, other project stakeholders interacting with the team are included 
in the survey. An example of a partial survey is found in Table 14.2. After the results 
are tabulated, the team meets with the facilitator and/or senior management, and the 
results are reviewed.
This session is comparable to the team-building sessions described in Chapter 11, 
except that the focus is on using the survey results to assess the development of the 
team, its strengths and weaknesses, and the lessons that can be applied to future proj￾ect work. The results of team evaluation surveys are helpful in changing behavior to 
better support team communication, the team approach, and the continuous improve￾ment of team performance.
Individual, Team Member, and Project Manager Performance Reviews
Organizations vary in the extent to which their project managers are actively involved 
in the appraisal process of team members. In organizations where projects are man￾aged within a functional organization, the team member’s area manager, not the proj￾ect manager, is responsible for assessing performance. The area manager may solicit 
the project manager’s opinion of the individual’s performance on a specific project; 
this will be factored into the individual’s overall performance. In a balanced matrix, 
the project manager and the area manager jointly evaluate an individual’s perfor￾mance. In project matrix and project organizations in which the lion’s share of the 
individual’s work is project related, the project manager is responsible for appraising 
individual performance. One process that appears to be gaining wider acceptance is 
the multi-rater appraisal, or “360-degree feedback,” which involves soliciting feedback 
concerning team members’ performance from all the people their work affects. This 
would include not only project and area managers but also peers, subordinates, and 
even customers. See Snapshot from Practice 14.5: The 360-Degree Feedback.
Performance appraisals generally fulfill two important functions. The first is devel￾opmental: the focus is on identifying individual strengths and weaknesses and devel￾oping action plans for improving performance. The second is evaluative and involves 
assessing how well a person has performed in order to determine salary or merit 
adjustments. These two functions are not compatible. Employees, in their eagerness 
to find out how much pay they will receive, tend to tune out constructive feedback

More and more companies are 
discarding the traditional superior￾subordinate performance feed￾back process and replacing it with 
360-degree feedback systems. The 
360-degree feedback approach gathers behavioral 
observations from many sources within the organi￾zation and includes employee self-assessment. The 
individual completes the same structured evalua￾tion process that superiors, project team members, 
peers, and in many cases external customers use 
to evaluate a performance. Survey questionnaires, 
augmented by a few open-ended questions, are 
typically used to gather information.
Summary results are compared against organi￾zational strategies, values, and business objectives. 
The feedback is communicated to the individual 
with the assistance of the company’s Human 
Resources Department or an outside consultant. 
The technique is used by a growing number of firms, 
including General Electric, AT&T, Mobil Oil, Nabisco, 
Hewlett Packard, and Warner-Lambert.
The objective of the 360-degree process is to 
identify areas for individual improvement. When 
anonymous feedback solicited from others is 
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 14.5 The 360-Degree Feedback*
compared with the individual’s self-evaluations, the 
individual may form a more realistic picture of his/her 
strengths and weaknesses. This may prompt behav￾ioral change if the weaknesses identified were pre￾viously unknown to the individual. So, for example, 
a project manager who thinks s/he delegates work 
effectively finds out that subordinates disagree. This 
causes him/her to rethink how s/he delegates and to 
decide to delegate more and sooner.
Many firms obtain feedback from internal and 
external project customers. For example, a cli￾ent may evaluate a project manager or member 
of the project team according to how effectively 
the individual gets things done without creating 
unnecessary adversarial relationships. Incorporat￾ing customer feedback in the evaluation process 
underscores collaboration and the importance of 
client expectations in determining project success.

on how they can improve their performance. Likewise, managers tend to be more 
concerned with justifying their decision than engaging in a meaningful discussion on 
how employees can improve their performance. It is difficult to be both a coach and 
a judge. As a result, several experts on performance appraisal systems recommend 
that organizations separate performance reviews, which focus on individual improve￾ment, from pay reviews, which allocate the distribution of rewards (cf., Latham & 
Wexley, 1993; Romanoff, 1989).
In some matrix organizations, project managers conduct the performance reviews, 
while area managers are responsible for pay reviews. In other cases, performance 
reviews are part of the project closure process, and pay reviews are the primary objective 
of the annual performance appraisal. Other organizations avoid this dilemma by allocat￾ing only group rewards for project work and providing annual awards for individual 
performance. The remaining discussion is directed at reviews designed to improve per￾formance because pay reviews are often outside the jurisdiction of the project manager.
Individual Reviews
Organizations employ a wide range of methods to review individual performance on 
a project. In general, review methods of individual performance center on the techni￾cal and social skills brought to the project and team. Some organizations rely simply 
on an informal discussion between the project manager and the project member. Other 
Final PDF to printerChapter 14 Project Closure 563
lar60886_ch14_543-572.indd 563 10/14/23 12:00 pm
organizations require project managers to submit written evaluations that describe and 
assess an individual’s performance on a project. Many organizations use rating scales 
similar to the team evaluation survey in which the project manager rates the individual 
according to a certain scale (e.g., from 1 to 5) on a number of relevant performance 
dimensions (e.g., teamwork, customer relations). Some organizations augment these rat￾ing schemes with behaviorally anchored descriptions of what constitutes a 1 rating, a 
2 rating, and so forth. Each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and, unfortunately, 
in many organizations, the appraisal systems were designed to support mainstream oper￾ations and not unique project work. The bottom line is that project managers have to use 
as best they can the performance review system mandated by their organization.
Regardless of the method, the project manager needs to meet with each team mem￾ber and discuss his/her performance. Following are some general tips for conducting 
performance reviews.
∙ Always begin the process by asking the individual to evaluate his/her contributions 
to the project. First, this approach may yield valuable information that you were 
not aware of. Second, the approach may provide an early warning for situations in 
which there is disparity in assessments. Finally, this method reduces the judgmental 
nature of the discussion.
∙ Avoid, when possible, drawing comparisons with other team members; rather, 
assess the individual in terms of established standards and expectations. Compari￾sons tend to undermine cohesion and divert attention away from what the indi￾vidual needs to do to improve performance.
∙ When you have to be critical, focus the criticism on specific examples of behavior 
rather than on the individual personally. Describe in specific terms how the behav￾ior affected the project.
∙ Be consistent and fair in your treatment of all team members. Nothing breeds 
resentment more than if, through the grapevine, individuals feel they are being held 
to a different standard than are other project members.
∙ Treat the review as only one point in an ongoing process. Use it to reach an agree￾ment on how the individual can improve his/her performance.
Both managers and subordinates may dread a formal performance review. Neither 
side feels comfortable with the evaluative nature of the discussion and the potential for 
misunderstanding and hurt feelings. Much of this anxiety can be alleviated if the proj￾ect manager is doing his/her job well. Project managers should constantly give team 
members feedback throughout the project so that individuals can have a pretty good 
idea of how well they have performed and how the manager feels before the formal 
meeting. Post-project angst can be avoided if pre-project expectations are discussed 
before the project and regularly reinforced during project performance.
While in many cases, the same process that is applied to reviewing the performance 
of team members is applied to evaluating the project manager, many organizations 
augment this process, given the importance of the position to their organization. This 
is where conducting the 360-degree review is becoming more popular. In project￾driven organizations, the project office typically is responsible for collecting informa￾tion on a specific project manager from customers, vendors, team members, peers, and 
other managers. This approach has tremendous promise for developing more effective 
project managers.
In addition to performance reviews, data are collected for project retrospectives, 
which can present situations that may influence performance. In these situations, per￾formance evaluations should recognize and note the unusual situation.

Summary The goals of project closure are to complete the project and to improve performance 
in future projects. Implementing closure and review has three major deliverables: 
wrap-up, audit, and performance evaluation. Wrap-up activities put the project “to 
bed” and include completing the final project deliverable, closing accounts, finding 
new opportunities for project staff, closing facilities, and creating the final report. 
Project audits assess the overall success of the project. Retrospectives are used to 
identify lessons learned and improve future performance. Individual and team eval￾uations assess performance and opportunities for improvement. A project should 
not be considered done until all three activities have been completed. The culture 
of the organization and the project team will play a major factor in the efficacy of 
these activities.
1. How does the project closure review differ from the performance measurement 
control system discussed in Chapter 13?
2. What major information would you expect to find in a project audit?
3. Why is it difficult to perform a truly independent, objective review?
4. Comment on the following statement: “We cannot afford to terminate the project 
now. We have already spent more than 50 percent of the project budget.”
5. Why should an organization be interested in knowing what level they are at in the 
project maturity model?
6. Why should you separate performance reviews from pay reviews? How do you do 
this?
7. Advocates of retrospective methodology claim there are distinguishing character￾istics that increase its value over past lessons learned methods. What are they? 
How does each characteristic enhance project closure and review?

14.5 The 360-Degree Feedback
1. Have you been the subject of a 360-degree review or participated in one? 
What was it like? How useful was it?
2. What effect do you think 360-degree reviews have on the culture of an 
organization?
Chapter 14 Project Closure 565
1. Consider a course that you recently completed. Perform a review of the course (the 
course represents a project and the course syllabus represents the project plan).
2. Imagine you are conducting a review of the International Space Station project. 
Research press coverage and the Internet to collect information on the current 
status of the project. What are the successes and failures to date? What forecasts 
would you make about the completion of the project and why? What recommen￾dations would you make to top management of the program and why?
3. Interview a project manager who works for an organization that implements mul￾tiple projects. Ask the manager what kind of closure procedures are used to com￾plete a project and whether lessons learned are used.
4. What are some of the lessons learned from a recent project in your organization? 
Was a retrospective done? What action plans were generated to improve processes 
as a result of the project?

Case 14.1
Halo for Heroes II
You are a member of a project management practicum class. The major assignment for 
this class is to plan and implement a fund-raising project that will raise at least $1,500 
and provide an opportunity to practice project management. You have joined a group 
of six students who have decided to organize an event based on the popular Halo video 
game. Your professor tells your group that they are in luck because another group did 
a similar project last year. He hands you a copy of their post-project audit.
Review the document and answer the following questions:
1. What are the two or three most valuable lessons you learned from this report and 
why?
2. What are one or two important questions/issues that are missing from their report 
that you wish were addressed? Explain why this information would be useful.
3. Briefly discuss the value of project audits based on this example. Imagine what it 
would be like if you did not have the audit.
Project Halo Audit
Objective: To raise at least $1,000 for the National Military Families Association by conducting a Halo video 
game tournament in Kleinsorge Hall on November 16 and 17.
Operation
See tournament information (below) for a detailed description on how the tournament was managed.
Risk Management
Through risk assessment, we were able to identify and mitigate potential risks to the project. We were con￾cerned with technical difficulties in setting up the gaming operations in the different classrooms. We did a 
trial run three days before the tournament in one of the classrooms to work out the mechanics of connecting 
consoles to the audio/video equipment in the room. This made setting up things on the first day of the tourna￾ment much easier. One surprise was that a few players failed to show up at designated times and we wished 
we had their cell phone numbers to contact them.
Outcomes
Our final contestant count was marked at 100 contestants, for a total of $1,000 in ticket sales. In addition, 
we received some cash donations from private sponsors, donated color fliers and equipment rental, 12 
cases of Mountain Dew from Pepsi, and several smaller incentives from local businesses. The total valu￾ation of all ticket sales and donated items was $3,113.43. We were unable to locate a business willing 
to sponsor any large prizes; therefore, we had to purchase these out of our cash proceeds. After the pur￾chase of all prizes and repayment of $500.00 to Prof. X for our seed money, our final net proceeds were 
$720.00. Despite not reaching our financial goal, the participants enjoyed the experience and we learned 
a lot about managing a project.
Lessons Learned
Don’t advertise specific prizes until you have obtained them. We assumed we could get a local retailer to 
donate the grand prize (Xbox 360) but ultimately we had to pay for it ourselves.
A multimedia marketing campaign is needed to reach the target audience. We utilized several different 
strategies to reach our target market, including a dedicated website and PayPal signup, a donation drive web 
page extended on this site, physical kiosk signups, the development and distribution of 2,500 color fliers, a 
Final PDF to printer568 Chapter 14 Project Closure
lar60886_ch14_543-572.indd 568 10/14/23 12:00 pm
MySpace page, a Facebook page, and an announcement on the College of Business website. We actually had 
contestants from as far away as Portland and Eugene.
Do a walk-through at least one day before the tournament.
Take time out to focus on the team. Team-building exercises we did in class, like “My group as a car,” 
helped us resolve interpersonal issues before they became serious.
Many of us felt the grand prize was a deterrent, with many prospective players opting out because they 
did not feel they were good enough at playing Halo to compete for such a lofty prize. In retrospect, we felt we 
could have done just as well by using donated prizes, like tickets for the local movie theaters and gift cards.
Next time we would set up a loser’s bracket so that players would have a chance to play against others 
with comparable ability and win prizes.
You need luck or personal contacts to secure big sponsorships. We had neither. However, we were sur￾prised at how willing local businesses were to donate small prizes to the project.
Take advantage of the contacts you have on your team. Despite our extensive marketing campaign, 
roughly half of the participants were friends of ours. Your team’s social network provides both opportunities 
and limitations. For example, we had no active members in the Greek community on campus to organize a 
competition across houses.

Case 14.2
Maximum Megahertz Project
Olaf Gundersen, the CEO of Wireless Telecom Company, is in a quandary. Last year 
he accepted the Maximum Megahertz project suggested by six up-and-coming young 
R&D corporate stars. Although Olaf did not truly understand the technical importance 
of the project, the creators of the project needed only $600,000, so it seemed like 
a good risk. Now the group is asking for $800,000 and a six-month extension on a 
project that is already four months behind. However, the team feels confident they can 
turn things around. The project manager and project team feel that if they hang in there 
a little longer they will be able to overcome the roadblocks they are encountering—
especially those that reduce power, increase speed, and use a new technology battery. 
Other managers familiar with the project hint that the power pack problem might be 
solved but “the battery problem will never be solved.” Olaf believes he is locked into 
this project; his gut feeling tells him the project will never materialize and he should 
get out. John, his human resource manager, suggested bringing in a consultant to axe 
the project.
Olaf decided to call his friend Dawn O’Connor, the CEO of an accounting soft￾ware company. He asked her, “What do you do when project costs and deadlines 
escalate drastically? How do you handle doubtful projects?” Her response was “Let 
another project manager look at the project. Ask, ‘If you took over this project tomor￾row, could you achieve the required results, given the extended time and additional 
money?’ If the answer is no, I call my top management team together and have them 
review the doubtful project in relation to other projects in our project portfolio.” Olaf 
feels this is good advice.
Unfortunately, the Maximum Megahertz project is not an isolated example. Over 
the last five years, there have been three projects that were never completed. “We 
just seemed to pour more money into them, even though we had a pretty good idea 
the projects were dying. The cost of those projects was high; those resources could 
have been better used on other projects.” Olaf wonders, “Do we ever learn from our 
mistakes? How can we develop a process that catches errant projects early? More 
importantly, how do we ease a project manager and team off an errant project without 
embarrassment?” Olaf certainly does not want to lose the six bright stars on the Maxi￾mum Megahertz project.
Olaf is contemplating how his growing telecommunications company should deal 
with the problem of identifying projects that should be terminated early, how to allow 
good managers to make mistakes without public embarrassment, and how they all can 
learn from their mistakes.
Give Olaf a plan of action for the future that attacks the problem. Be specific and 
provide examples that relate to Wireless Telecom Company.

574 Chapter 15 Agile Project Management
Agile is an attitude, not a technique with boundaries. An attitude has no 
boundaries, so we wouldn’t ask “can I use agile here” but rather “how 
agile can we be here?”
—Alistair Cockburn, signatory of the Manifesto for Agile Software Development.
As project management entered the new millennium, many professionals recognized 
that “one size fits all” project management methods did not meet their needs. This 
was especially true for those working on software and product development projects 
in which the end product is not well defined and evolves over time. This project envi￾ronment requires flexibility and the ability to manage changes as more information 
and learning take place. Enter Agile Project Management (Agile PM). Instead of 
attempting to plan the entire project up front, Agile PM relies on iterative, incremental 
development cycles to complete projects.
Ken Schwaber uses the analogy of building a house to explain the difference 
between iterative, incremental development (IID) and traditional project manage￾ment.1
 In the traditional approach, the buyers cannot move into the house until the 
entire house is completed. The iterative approach would build the house room by 
room. The plumbing, electrical, and infrastructure would be built for the most impor￾tant room (e.g., kitchen) first and then extended to each room as it was constructed. 
Each time a room was completed, the builders and the buyers would assess progress 
and make adjustments. In some cases, the buyers would realize that they didn’t need 
that extra room they felt they had to have. In other cases, they would add features they 
didn’t realize they needed to have. Ultimately the house would be built to fit the cus￾tomer’s wishes.
Agile PM is ideal for exploratory projects in which requirements need to be discov￾ered and new technology tested. It focuses on active collaboration between the project 
team and customer representatives, breaking projects into small, functional pieces and

adapting to changing requirements. While iterative development principles have been 
around for some time, it is only recently that agile methodologies have taken root 
within the project management profession.
In this chapter, the core principles of Agile PM are discussed and compared 
with traditional project management methods. A specific agile methodology called 
Scrum is used to describe these principles in action. Two other variant forms of 
Agile are discussed next: Extreme Programming and Kanban. Agile works best 
with small teams, and the challenges of applying Agile to large projects are 
examined.  Limitations and concerns are addressed next. The chapter concludes 
with a discussion of hybrid arrangements in which both traditional and Agile meth￾ods are used.
15.1 Traditional versus Agile Methods
When software products burst on the commercial scene in the 1980s, the traditional 
plan-driven management approach was applied to their development. This resulted in 
what is commonly referred to as the “waterfall” approach to software development. 
The waterfall method features a series of logical phases in which progress flows from 
one phase to the next until completion (see Figure 15.1). The key assumption is that 
essential requirements can be defined up front so the software can be designed, built, 
tested, and released. Software projects are completed in a linear, plan-driven fashion, 
like any other project.
People soon found that software projects were not like other projects and the results 
proved it. For example, the Standish group reported in 1995 that 31 percent of soft￾ware projects are canceled each year and only 16 percent are completed on time and 
budget (The Standish Group International, 1995).

576 Chapter 15 Agile Project Management
Frustrated by poor results, software engineers began to experiment with more flexible, 
“agile” approaches to managing software projects. Tensions arose between management 
who mandated the use of standard templates, and the waterfall method, and the project 
managers who saw it as a hindrance to their work. A grass roots revolution broke out 
within the software industry. Several key advocates for change formed the Agile Alliance 
and published the Agile Manifesto in 2001. The manifesto affirmed a radically different 
set of values than those being applied by management to projects they were working on:
∙ Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
∙ Working software over comprehensive documentation.
∙ Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
∙ Responding to change over following a plan.
These four values were expanded upon by a set of 12 guiding principles:
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous deliv￾ery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of 
months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Businesspeople and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and sup￾port they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a 
development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing 
teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then turns 
and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
The manifesto is a testament for the socio-technical approach to project manage￾ment. Notice how many of the values and principles relate to the people doing the 
work. They are a response to an overly controlling, technical approach to software 
development mandated by the waterfall approach that neither matches the needs of the 
programmers nor the reality of the work. Furthermore, the manifesto reflects a “mind￾set,” not an elaborate set of tools or procedures. This mindset reflects a culture that 
values collaboration, trust, embracing change, and customer satisfaction.
To put Agile PM in the proper context, let’s revisit the project uncertainty dia￾gram (see Figure 15.2) introduced in Chapter 1. The key point is that traditional proj￾ect management methods were developed to operate in the predictable zone where 
the scope is fairly well established and the technology is known. Agile lives in the 
unpredictable zone. It represents a fundamental shift away from the traditional, plan￾driven approach by adopting a more experimental and adaptive approach to manag￾ing projects. Projects evolve, rather than are executed. Solutions are discovered, not 
implemented. Some of the differences between Agile PM and traditional project man￾agement are displayed in Table 15.1.

15.2 Agile PM
Fundamentally Agile PM utilizes a rolling wave planning and scheduling project 
methodology. That is, the final project design is not known in great detail and is con￾tinuously developed through a series of incremental iterations over time. Iterations are 
short time frames (“time boxes”) that typically last from one to four weeks. The goal of 
each iteration is to develop a workable product that satisfies one or more desired prod￾uct features to demonstrate to the customer and other key stakeholders. At the end of 
each iteration, stakeholders and customers review progress and re-evaluate priorities 
to ensure alignment with customer needs and company goals. Adjustments are made 
and a different iterative cycle begins. Each new iteration subsumes the work of the 
previous iterations and adds new capabilities to the evolving product (see Figure 15.3) 
to produce a next, expanded version of the product. See Snapshot from Practice 15.1: 
IDEO: Masters of Design for an example of iterative development in action. 
Iterative development processes provide the following important advantages:
∙ Continuous integration, verification, and validation of the evolving product.
∙ Frequent demonstration of progress to increase the likelihood that the end product 
will satisfy customer needs.
∙ Early detection of defects and problems.

New product: Customer

IDEO, headquartered in Palo Alto, 
California, is one of the premier design 
firms in the world. They are respon￾sible for a wide range of product 
innovations, including the first Apple 
mouse, Head’s Airflow tennis racket, Zyliss Salad Spin￾ner, and Nokia N-Gage smartphones. IDEO’s many cli￾ents include Pepsi-Cola, 3M, Logitech, Nike, and HBO. 
IDEO has won more of the BusinessWeek/IDSA Indus￾trial Design Excellence Awards than any other firm.
IDEO’s approach to product design relies heavily 
on an iterative development process in which prod￾uct prototypes are used to explore and further refine 
product ideas. CEO Tim Brown states that the goal of 
prototyping “is to learn about the strengths and weak￾nesses of the idea and identify new directions that the 
prototype might take.”
For example, IDEO worked with Procter and Gam￾ble to develop a new Crest toothpaste tube. The chal￾lenge was to improve the traditional screw-on cap, 
which always gets gunked up with toothpaste. IDEO’s 
first solution was a pop-on, pop-off cap. However, when 
designers created rough prototypes and watched peo￾ple use them, they quickly noticed that users kept trying 
to unscrew the cap, even though they were told how it 
worked. The designers concluded that the action was a 
well-ingrained habit that would probably be impossible 
to break. So they came up with a hybrid: a twist-off cap 
that had a short thread but would still be easy to clean.
Focused prototyping resolves critical problems one 
by one. Brown recommends that prototypes should 
only take as much time and effort as needed to gener￾ate useful feedback and evolve an idea.
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 15.1 IDEO: Masters of Design*
For example, IDEO was working on a chair for 
Vecta, a high-end office furniture manufacturer. The 
project had evolved to the point where the height￾adjustment lever that tilted with the chair became criti￾cal. The team didn’t build the whole chair or even the 
tilt mechanism. They just built the little lever and its 
interface with the tilt mechanism. It took only a couple 
of hours. When finished the prototype quickly demon￾strated that the principle would work.
“It doesn’t matter how clever you are, your first 
idea about something is never right,” Brown says, 
“so the great value of prototyping—and prototyping 
quickly and inexpensively—is that you learn about the 
idea and make it better.”

There is growing evidence that iterative and evolutionary development is 
superior to traditional, plan-driven project management when it comes to creat￾ing new products. (See Research Highlight 15.1: Product Development Practices 
That Work.)
It should be noted that Agile PM is not one set method but a family of methods 
designed to respond to the challenges of unpredictable projects. A few of the more 
popular ones are listed here:
Alan MacCormack and his col￾leagues at Harvard Business 
School conducted a two-year in￾depth study of 29 software proj￾ects to answer the question “Does 
evolutionary development, rather 
than the waterfall model, result in better success?” 
The waterfall model is the name used in the soft￾ware industry for the traditional approach to proj￾ect management in which a process breakdown 
structure (PBS) is used to first define all the require￾ments up front and then initiate a design, build, 
test, and deploy sequence. Conversely, evolution￾ary development is the term used to describe an 
Agile approach in which customers test early ver￾sions of the software, and requirements emerge 
and are refined after each demonstration.
The results of the study overwhelmingly favored 
the iterative, Agile approach to software develop￾ment. Several key practices now associated with 
Agile Project Management were found to be statis￾tically correlated with the most successful projects:
1. An iterative life cycle with early release of the 
evolving product to stakeholders for review 
and feedback.
2. The daily incorporation of new software and 
rapid feedback on design changes.
3. A flexible product architecture that is both mod￾ular and scalable.
MacCormack asserts that uncertainty on software 
projects dictates short “microprojects”—down to 
level of features. This is not limited to just software 
projects but to any new-product endeavor where 
uncertainty is high and the need for customer feed￾back and refinement is critical to success.

While each of these methods has unique elements and applications, most are based 
on the following Agile principles:
∙ Focus on customer value. Employ business-driven prioritizations of requirements 
and features.
∙ Iterative and incremental delivery. Create a flow of value to customers by 
“chunking” project delivery into small, functioning increments.
∙ Experimentation and adaptation. Test assumptions early and build working 
prototypes to solicit customer feedback and refine product requirements.
∙ Self-organization. Team members decide among themselves what should be done 
and who should do it.

∙ Servant leadership. The project manager facilitates rather than directs 
collaboration.
∙ Continuous improvement. Teams reflect, learn, and adapt to change; work informs 
the plan.
The Agile methodology known as Scrum will be used to illustrate how these core 
principles are put into action.
15.3 Agile PM in Action: Scrum
Scrum can be traced back to the work of Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka, who 
in 1986 described a new holistic approach to developing new products. They were 
critical of the traditional, relay approach of passing off work from requirements to 
design to fabricate. Instead, Takeuchi and Nonaka liken new product development to 
rugby. The scrum metaphor has been expanded and refined into a fairly prescriptive 
framework that has enjoyed success on high-tech and software development projects 
(see Snapshot from Practice 15.2: Soul Searching after 9/11).
LO 15-4
Understand the basic 
methodology used in 
Scrum.
Over 2,792 lives were lost in the col￾lapse of the World Trade Center (WTC) 
on September 11, 2001. While rescu￾ers labored night and day to recover 
the bodies, a small team of Michigan 
software engineers set about salvaging their identities.
New York City hired Gene Codes, an Ann Arbor, 
Michigan, bioinformatics company, to reinvent the sci￾ence of DNA mass identification by creating software 
that would inventory and match the victims’ remains 
and reunite them with their families. They were to do 
so as soon as possible with no errors. Experts pre￾dicted that the violence of the collapse and the intense 
heat of the fires meant that at best 25 percent of the 
victims would be identified.
Gene Codes hired William Wake, an independent 
software coach, to work with their team of eight soft￾ware engineers on the project. Wake introduced the 
team to Agile PM. Under Wake’s guidance, an environ￾ment of intense interaction and communication was 
created within the programming team by scheduling 
frequent releases, tempered by constant testing, and 
feedback from its users. Testing was done before, dur￾ing, and after the code was written to ensure the same 
bugs (errors) didn’t surface twice.
At the end of each week’s iteration, the staff held a 
retrospective. They listed things that worked well and 
what needed improvement on fluorescent pink, green,

 notes, transforming the entire wall 
into a case of art imitating life. Under “Worked Well,” 
a note said, “Figured out how to use debug form on 
a wrapped test class.” One square under the “Needs 
Improvement” category merely read, “I’m tired.”
Whether out of patriotism or professionalism, 
the team routinely arrived each day at 7:00 a.m. and 
worked until midnight. Engineers such as Dave Relyea 
just wanted to help. “We thought about the victims, 
the families, and the people at the Office of the Chief 
Medical Examiner working around the clock. What they 
were going through made us feel like we could never 
work hard enough.”
The product of their labor was the Mass Fatal￾ity Identification System (M-FISys), which contained 
more than 164,000 lines of code. M-FISys linked all 
the information in the identification project: 11,641 
swab samples from 7,166 family members; 7,681 
personal effects (e.g., toothbrushes, hair brushes) and 
the results of the three types of DNA tests; and nearly 
20,000 human remains. The chance of false match was 
less than 1 in 3.58 million.
In the end, with the help of M-FISys, the New York 
medical examiner was able to identify 1,521 of the 
more than 2,792 people who perished in the WTC 
disaster.

Scrum, like other Agile methods, begins with a high-level scope definition and 
ballpark time and cost estimates for the project. The scope and cost estimates should 
be complete enough that management are comfortable with the estimates. The theory 
is that since requirements evolve over time, detailed up-front planning will be wasted. 
In place of a product WBS, Scrum uses product features as deliverables. A feature is 
defined as a piece of a product that delivers some useful functionality to a customer. In 
the case of a software project, a feature may be a bank customer being able to change 
her PIN. In the case of a high-tech product, it may be 5G wireless access. Features 
are prioritized by their perceived highest value. The project team tackles the highest￾priority feasible features first. Priorities are re-evaluated after each iteration. Iterations 
are called sprints and should last no longer than four weeks. The goal of each sprint 
is to produce fully functional features. This forces the team to tackle tough decisions 
early in order to create a workable demonstration.
Specific features are created according to four distinct phases: analysis, design, 
build, and test (see Figure 15.4). Each feature can be thought of as a mini-project. The 
first phase is an analysis and review of functional requirements that will be needed to 
complete the feature. The team commits to meeting these requirements. The second 
phase is the development of a design that meets the requirements of the feature. The 
third phase is to build the feature so that it is functional. Finally, the feature is tested 
and documented. At the end of each sprint, features are demonstrated. Within this 
sprint framework, Scrum relies on specific roles, meetings, and documents/logs to 
manage the project. 
Roles and Responsibilities
There are three key roles in the scrum process: product owner, development team, and 
Scrum master.
Product Owner The product owner acts on behalf of customers/end users to repre￾sent their interests. For commercial development projects, the product owner may be 
the product manager. For internal projects, the product owner might be the manager 
of the business group that will benefit from the software. In other cases, the product 
owner might be a representative of the client organization. They are responsible for 
Final PDF to printerlar60886_ch15_573-600.indd 582 09/28/23 07:43 am
582 Chapter 15 Agile Project Management
ensuring that the development team focuses their efforts on developing a product that 
will fulfill the business objective of the project.
The product owner in consultation with others establishes the initial list of product 
requirements and prioritizes them in the product backlog. Owners often work with the 
development team to refine features through stories and end user cases (e.g., when 
the user clicks the F2 key an option drop-down window appears). The product owners 
negotiate sprint goals and backlog items with the development team. Product owners 
have the option to change features and priorities at the end of each sprint, if desired. 
However, no changes should be made once a sprint has started. Product owners are 
the final arbiters on requirements questions and are empowered to accept or reject each 
product increment. They ultimately decide whether the project is completed. Product 
owners are the keepers of the product vision and the watchdogs on project cost.
Development Team The team is responsible for delivering the product. A team is 
typically made up of five to nine people with cross-functional skill sets. There are no 
designated roles or titles; people take on different responsibilities depending on the 
nature of the work. The team is a self-organizing team in the sense they decide both 
who does the work and how the work is to be accomplished. Team members should be 
co-located so that intense face-to-face collaboration occurs. They are responsible for 
achieving commitments they make at the sprint planning and sprint review meetings.
Scrum Master (Project Manager) The Scrum master facilitates the scrum pro￾cess and resolves impediments at the team and organization levels. The Scrum master 
is not the leader of the team (the team leads itself!) but acts as a buffer between the 
team and outside interference. They have no formal authority. Instead, they are respon￾sible for making sure that the scrum process is adhered to. They help the product 
owner with planning and try to keep the team energized. The Scrum master serves 
more as a coach than a manager. This servant leadership style empowers the team to 
complete the project.
Scrum Meetings
Scrum uses a series of coordinated meetings to manage the development process (see 
Figure 15.5). 
Release Planning The purpose of release planning is to establish the goals and 
general plan for the project. The product owner works with the team, Scrum master, 
and others to address the question of how the project can meet or exceed the desired 
customer expectations and return on investment. Outcomes of this meeting include 
establishing highest-priority product backlog, the major risks, and the overall features 
and functionality that the released product will contain. The meeting also produces a 
probable delivery date and initial cost estimates if nothing changes. Management can 
then monitor progress and make changes to the release plan on a sprint-by-sprint basis.

Chapter 15 Agile Project Management 583
Sprint Planning At the start of each sprint, the product owner and development team 
negotiate which product backlog items the team will attempt this sprint. The product 
owner is responsible for identifying which features are most important, and the team 
is responsible for determining what is possible within the sprint. If it is impossible to 
complete a certain key item within four weeks, the team works with the product owner 
to break the feature down into doable pieces. All committed items are recorded in a 
product backlog. The team uses this backlog to prioritize specific work to be done and 
assign initial responsibilities. These tasks are recorded in the sprint backlog. Once the 
meeting has adjourned, the goals for the sprint cannot be changed.
Daily Scrum The heartbeat of an Agile project is the daily meetings, which are 
commonly referred to as the “Scrum.” Each workday at the same time and place, team 
members stand in a circle and take turns answering the following key questions:
1. What have you done since the last Scrum?
2. What will you do between now and the next Scrum?
3. What is getting in the way of (blocks) your performing your work as effectively as 
possible?
The daily Scrum, which typically lasts 15 minutes, is held next to a whiteboard, 
after which time all tasks and blocks are recorded. The Scrum master erases blocks 
once they have been removed.
The meetings must start on time. A late fine (e.g., $1 to be collected and donated 
to charity by the Scrum master) is a popular rule. The meeting is limited to just those 
three core questions. Members stand to create a sense of urgency. Immediately after￾ward, specific members may meet to resolve issues that surfaced.
The value of the daily Scrum is that it creates a daily mechanism to quickly inform 
the team about the state of the project. It sustains a sense of team identity that encour￾ages openness and the resolution of problems in real time. Having everyone report 
what s/he plans to do for that day generates a social promise to the group, thereby 
building accountability.
Notice again that the team is self-managed. The Scrum master does not assign daily 
tasks to team members; the team decide among themselves. The Scrum master role is 
to see that the sprint is running correctly. They are not “master” of the team but, rather, 
“master” of the process.
Sprint Review At the end of each sprint, the team demonstrate the actual work prod￾uct increments they have built to the product owner and other relevant stakeholders. 
Feedback is solicited from the product owner and other relevant stakeholders. The 
product owner declares which items are “done” and which items need further work 
and are returned to the product backlog. The team can take this opportunity to suggest 
improvements and new features for the product owner to accept or reject. The sprint 
review meeting is an opportunity to examine and adapt the product as it emerges and 
iteratively refine key requirements. Such refinements will be the subject of the next 
sprint planning meeting.
Sprint Retrospective The purpose of the retrospective meeting is to reflect on how 
well the previous sprint went and to identify specific actions that can improve future 
sprints. The Scrum master typically facilitates this meeting and the team decide which 
changes will be made in how they work together for the next sprint. The retrospective 
reflects Scrum’s commitment to continuous improvement and the value it places on 
improving not only products but also team interactions.

Product and Sprint Backlogs
Each project has a product backlog and a sprint backlog. The product owner controls 
the product backlog and the team controls the sprint backlog. The product backlog
is the customer’s prioritized list of key features desired when the project is completed. 
The product backlog usually defines each feature and estimates time, cost, and work 
remaining. See Figure 15.6 for a partial product backlog for a software project. 
The sprint backlog is developed and controlled by the team. It represents the 
amount of work the team commits to complete during the next sprint. The sprint back￾log lists the tasks (activities) that must be completed to deliver a functional feature or 
segment of a feature. The sprint backlog also serves as a status document by listing the 
person responsible for each task and the remaining hours of work and by recording the 
task as finished, in process, or not yet started. See Figure 15.7 for a partial example of 
a sprint backlog. 
Scrum does not use any of the conventional project management tools, like Gantt 
charts or network diagrams. Instead, it relies on the daily Scrums and the active 
involvement of the product owner to manage work flow. Risk is mitigated by short 
developmental cycles and rigorous testing.

Chapter 15 Agile Project Management 585
League of Legends is a very popu￾lar multiplayer online battle arena 
video game developed and pub￾lished by Riot Games. In League of 
Legends, players assume the role of 
an unseen “summoner” that controls a “champion” 
with unique abilities and battle against other con￾trolled champions. When the game was first released 
in 2009, there were 40 champions. Now there are 
over 160!
The Champions team at Riot Games creates and 
updates champions for League of Legends. The work 
is a complex and creative process. Each champ must 
be emotionally engaging for the players and distin￾guish itself against the existing roster of champions. 
Riot Games has adapted Agile methods to create new 
champions.
CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COLLABORATION
Champions teams comprise 14 types of developers 
(designers, writers, artists, engineers, QA, produc￾ers, etc.). The multidisciplinary team provides a holis￾tic perspective and a tighter, more cohesive product. 
While differences in perspective can produce creative 
breakthroughs, they can also lead to conflicts and ten￾sion. The Champions team uses the product vision and 
Scrum rituals to help manage the team.
PRODUCT VISION
One of the early deliverables is a vision statement, or 
what Riot Games calls “The Dream.” The vision state￾ment describes the champions’ future state, once 
the team’s work is done. For the champion character 
“Ivern,” the team started off with a basic goal of creat￾ing a jungling druid who is a magical friend of the for￾est. Over time the team began to add different aspects 
of tree-spirit dryad myth into the character. Ivern’s final 
vision statement became
Ivern is a light-hearted and peculiar dryad who is 
part man, part nature. He roams the world, culti￾vating his surroundings, and imparting his good 
nature and unique view of the world to anyone he 
encounters.
SCRUM RITUALS
Stand-ups
Daily stand-ups allow the team to communicate updates 
and identify blockers. Even small tweaks have a cascade 
effect. For example, if a gameplayer designer changes the 
length of a spell by a second or even millisecond, the timing 
can change the mood and clarity of the spell. The sooner 
the whole team knows a change is coming, the sooner 
they can react and make sure other assets (animation, 
spell effect, sounds) support the gameplay needs.
Sprint Review
This is a review where the team members go over 
planned work and give each other feedback based on 
the champion’s vision statement and other product goals.
Playtest
At least once a sprint, members of the team playtest 
the champ in a real game situation followed by a team 
feedback session. These playtests give the whole team 
a more comprehensive understanding of how it feels 
to play as, with, or against the champion. For example, 
midway through Ivern’s development, a team member 
scored a team victory with almost 20 kills from Ivern. 
While the performance was memorable, it was incon￾sistent with the product vision of being a benevolent 
druid, and Ivern was stripped of many of his powers.
Evaluation Review
This is when the team looks at the champion as a whole 
and evaluates it against the specific fantasy and pro￾ductwide acceptance criteria using a Likert scale. By 
quantifying evaluations, the team can see which facets 
of the champion are in line with Riot Game’s standards 
and which could use more refinement.
Retrospectives
Even though the team created 160 champions over the 
span of 15 years, retrospectives are conducted every 
sprint to improve the process. Retrospectives compel 
the team to keep asking what is and isn’t working and 
make changes to keep creating evocative champions.

Sprint and Release Burndown Charts
Agile favors empirical and value-based measurement instead of predictive measure￾ment. Scrum uses “burndown” charts, which focus on the work remaining and are used 
to track progress. Sprint burndown charts are used to track progress on a daily basis 
Final PDF to printerlar60886_ch15_573-600.indd 586 09/28/23 07:43 am
586 Chapter 15 Agile Project Management
(see Figure 15.8). The vertical axis shows the remaining effort required to complete the 
sprint backlog, and the horizontal axis contains the number of days until the sprint is 
completed. The remaining effort is calculated by summing the time estimates for incom￾plete tasks recorded in the sprint backlog. These estimates are updated on a daily basis. 
In Figure 15.8, the circle line shows the ideal scenario if the sprint progresses as 
predicted by the initial task estimates, and the diamond line shows the actual perfor￾mance. Ideally, the diamond line should be very close to the solid line. When it is 
above the circle line the team is behind schedule, and when it is below the circle line 
the team is ahead of schedule. If the actual remaining line is above the ideal line for 
an extended period of time, then this signals that adjustments need to be made to the 
project. This could mean dropping a task, assigning additional resources, or working 
late. None of these are pleasant, but because of the sprint burndown chart, the team 
can respond sooner than just before the sprint deadline.
The release burndown chart is used to monitor progress toward completion of the 
project (see Figure 15.9). This chart displays the amount of work remaining across 
time. Before the start of each sprint, completion estimates are revised in the product 
backlog and totaled in the release burndown chart. Over time the chart becomes an 
excellent method for visualizing the relationship between the amount of work remain￾ing and the rate at which the team is reducing this work. Also, the intersection of the 
trend line for work remaining and the horizontal timeline can be used to estimate the 
probable completion date. The product owner and team use this information to “what 
if” the project by removing or adding functionality from the release to achieve a spe￾cific completion date or extend the date to include more functionality. 
In Figure 15.9, work remaining is recorded for the first six sprints and a trend line 
is used to revise the expected completion date. Note that in this example the project is 
expected to be completed later than planned. Does this mean the team is underperform￾ing? No, not necessarily! Remember, the product backlog is dynamic and at the end 
of each sprint the backlog is revised. Features are added, modified, or deleted. Work 
estimates are increased or decreased. There is no established baseline in Agile PM.

15.4 Extreme Programming and Kanban
Extreme Programming (XP)
Extreme Programming (XP) is a more aggressive form of Scrum that organizes 
people to produce higher-quality software more efficiently. Originally developed by 
programmer Kent Beck for the Chrysler Corporation, XP attempts to reduce the cost 
of changes in requirements by having multiple, short development cycles, rather than 
a long one (Beck, 1999; Beck & Andres, 2004; Beck & Fowler, 2000). XP considers 
change a natural, even desirable aspect of software development projects and should 
be planned for, instead of eliminated. It takes its name from the idea that the software 
engineering process is taken to “extreme levels” with this approach.
Two of the guiding features of XP are test-driven development and pair program￾ming. The XP approach is that if a little testing can eliminate a few flaws, a lot of 
testing can eliminate many more flaws. For example, unit tests determine whether a 
given feature works as intended. Acceptance testing confirms that the requirements as 
understood by the programmers satisfy the customer’s actual requirements, and inte￾gration testing detects incompatible basis. Testing occurs on a daily basis. Another 
unique feature of XP is paired programming. In XP, all code is written in collaboration 
between pairs of programmers who work side-by-side at the same machine during 
coding. One, the “driver,” writes code while the other, the “navigator,” reviews each 
line of code as it is entered. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
XP is founded on five values: 
Communication. The goal is to give all developers a shared view of the system, which 
matches the view held by the users of the system. To this end, XP favors simple designs, 
common metaphors, collaboration of users and programmers, frequent verbal communica￾tion, and feedback.
Simplicity. XP encourages starting with the simplest solution. Extra functionality can then 
be added later.
Feedback. Rapid testing reduces errors and ensures work is responsive to customer needs.

Courage. Several practices embody courage. One is the commandment to always design and 
code for today and not for tomorrow. This is an effort to avoid getting bogged down in design 
and requiring a lot of effort to implement anything else. Another example of courage is 
knowing when to throw code away: courage to remove source code that is obsolete, no matter 
how much effort was used to create that source code.
Respect. This includes respect for others as well as self-respect. Nobody on the team should 
feel unappreciated or ignored. This ensures a high level of motivation and encourages loyalty 
toward the team and toward the goal of the project.
XP is not without critics. Some argue that XP requires too much involvement from 
the user/customer and increases the risk of scope creep, since detailed requirements 
are not documented (Rosenberg & Stephens, 2003). Proponents argue that customer 
involvement is the price one pays to avoid unnecessary scope creep.
Kanban
Kanban is a lean management methodology first developed by Toyota. It has been 
adapted by Agile practitioners to help manage project work flow.
In its simplest form, Kanban consists of a whiteboard divided into three columns 
titled Planned, WIP (Work in Progress), and Done. The team identifies the distinct 
tasks, deliverables, or features associated with their projects. Each is labeled on Post￾it® notes or special “Kanban” cards. The cards are prioritized in terms of what needs 
to be done first and a queue is created in the Next column. The team works on the 
top-priority items. Once a task or feature has been completed the card is moved to the 
Done column and the next task is started. Like Scrum, the project team starts each 
day with a stand-up meeting to update the board, decide what needs to be done, and 
discuss impediments to progress (Barry & Benson, 2011).
Compared to other project management techniques, Kanban seems a bit too simplis￾tic. Users of this low-tech, high-touch technology attest to its power. Kanban boards 
provide clear insight into work flow, bottlenecks, blockers, and overall status.
Kanban is based on the idea of a pull system. A completed Kanban card signals 
when the team is ready for more work, which is pulled from the Next list. Work isn’t 
pushed from start to finish. It’s only when a task is completed that another task can 
be started. Limits are set based on the capability of the project team on the number of 
WIP tasks. For example, no more than three tasks can be in progress at any one time. 
This reduces the inefficiencies of multitasking and prevents lingering bottlenecks 
from emerging. Another strength of Kanban is that it helps the team visualize the work 
flow of the project and focus their attention on the most critical work. Finally, like 
Scrum, significant time is devoted to solving problems and developing better ways of 
accomplishing the work (Hammarberg & Sundewn, 2014).

Chapter 15 Agile Project Management 589
Depending upon the project, more elaborate mapping schemes can be used. For 
example, Tarne (2011) described a system for an IT Helpdesk that consisted of six 
columns: Opened Ticket, In Queue, Root Cause Analysis, Develop Fix, Test, and 
Deploy. More sophisticated Kanban tools can also be found online.2
Kanban is less prescriptive than most Agile approaches, and thus less disruptive. 
Organizations can begin applying Kanban methods with relative ease and progress 
toward full implementation if deemed appropriate.
15.5 Applying Agile PM to Large Projects
Scrum and most other Agile methods are ideally suited for distinct projects that can be 
completed by a small, five-to-nine-person team. Agile methods can be used on larger￾scale projects in which several teams are working on different features at the same 
time. In practice, this condition is called scaling. The chief challenge with scaling is 
integration—making sure that the different features being created work in harmony 
with each other.
There are no easy solutions to the integration challenge. Significant up-front plan￾ning is required to manage the interdependences of different features that will be 
developed. This is called “staging” and often is the subject of the first development 
iteration. Here protocols and roles for coordinating efforts and assuring compatibility 
are established. This is supported by establishing a clear product vision so that trade￾off decisions are consistent at the local team level.
Agile advocates recommend creating a hub structure (see Figure 15.10) with over￾lapping roles and responsibilities to manage large projects. There are several feature 
2
 For example, AGILEZEN (agilezen.com) provides a user-friendly, virtual Kanban board, customizable cards/tags and col￾ors, and a performance metrics tracker.

development teams. A separate integration and build team is formed consisting of 
part-time members of each feature team. This team tackles the sticky integration issue 
through testing and establishing requirements for the feature teams. To coordinate the 
multi-team structure a central project team is created consisting of a higher-level proj￾ect manager, a product manager (who represents the interests of the customer), and the 
leads (“project managers”) from the feature development teams. The project manage￾ment team provides coordination and facilitates project decision making. Their role is 
to steer rather than command the other teams. Teams may be real, virtual, or a combi￾nation. The entire system requires a spirit of collaboration to work. 
The Swedish aeronautics and defense firm Saab AB successfully scaled Agile to 
their large Gripen jet project. Saab AB deployed over 100 agile teams operating across 
software, hardware, and fuselage to develop the Gripen fighter jet. Saab coordinates 
through daily stand-ups. At 7:30 a.m., each frontline agile team meets to flag impedi￾ments that can’t be resolved by the team and to schedule the work for that day. By 
7:45 a.m. these impediments are escalated to the team of teams, where leaders work to 
settle issues or further escalate the issues. This approach continues, and by 8:45 a.m. 
the executive action team has a list of critical issues to resolve to keep progress on 
track. Aeronautics also coordinates things by having a common rhythm of three-week 
sprints, a project master plan, and co-location of traditionally disparate parts of the 
organization—for instance, putting test pilots on development teams. The results were 
dramatic. The Gripen has been recognized as the world’s most cost-effective military 
aircraft (Rigby, Sutherland, & Noble, 2018).
15.6 Limitations and Concerns
A survey of over 3,900 respondents working in software/IT, financial, and profes￾sional services provided a glimpse of the current state of Agile. Ninety-four percent 
report their firm uses Agile approaches, but only 53 percent report that their agile 
projects were successful. The biggest reasons for failure were (1) lack of experience 
with agile methods, (2) company culture at odds with core agile values, (3) lack of 
management support, and (4) external pressure to follow the traditional waterfall pro￾cess (Schur, 2015).
One cannot simply install Agile PM into an organization overnight. Agile PM is not 
a simple methodology. Not only do new techniques need to be learned, but it requires 
a significant mindset change. Adoption tends to evolve over time. Most companies 
report gradual introduction of Agile PM. They begin with a couple of pilot projects 
and with success a few more and so forth. Here the project management office can 
play a critical role by providing training and coaches to new agile teams.
Many of the Agile principles, including self-organizing teams and intense collabo￾ration, are incompatible with corporate cultures. For example, the principle of self￾organizing teams, in which members decide who should do what, regardless of rank or 
title, contradicts command and control structures. Likewise, intense collaboration is not 
for everyone. One Agile manager confessed that she had to let several of her top engi￾neers go because their lone-wolf personalities were not compatible with collaboration.
Agile PM does not satisfy top management’s need for control. Remember the new 
house analogy. The buyers got exactly what they wanted but did not know how much 
it would cost. Nor did they know how long it would take or even what it would look 
like when it was done. No matter how realistic “it depends” is, management as well as 
customers are accustomed to working with a greater level of certainty than Agile pro￾vides. In response to the financial concerns, many organizations establish “ceilings,”

which are the maximum budget or time not to be exceeded in the development of a 
given product or service.
In organizations in which the waterfall process is the dominant methodology there 
will be a natural tension and pressure to conform. Here Agile skeptics warn that evolv￾ing requirements contribute to scope creep. Sprints will produce a never-ending series 
of requests by product owner/user. They fear that Agile teams will go native and iden￾tify too much with what the customer wants and not what makes sense from a business 
point of view.
Another challenge not mentioned in the survey results is that Agile PM requires 
active customer involvement. Involvement comes in different forms. Designating an 
internal person to act as a product owner to represent the interests of end users is rela￾tively easy. Soliciting the active participation of external customers can be more prob￾lematic. Even though there is consistent evidence that customer participation enhances 
project success, not all customers want to be that actively involved. Many are simply 
too busy. Others believe that they hired the project team so they would not have to be 
involved. Securing the cooperation of customers to devote the requisite time to support 
Agile PM is often a source of frustration.
Despite the challenges, the repeated success and improvement in software and new￾product development projects has led to the acceptance of Agile PM by the traditional 
project management profession. In 2017 the Project Management Institute (PMI) and 
the Agile Alliance jointly published the Agile Practice Guide.
15.7 Hybrid Project Management
Sometimes organizations use both traditional and Agile methods to complete a project. 
This is referred to in the world of project management as hybrid project management.
The most common application is traditional project management being applied to all 
tasks except for software development which is completed via Scrum teams. However, 
Agile methods are not exclusive to software development. Businesses are realizing 
the value of using Agile when the conditions are appropriate (high uncertainty). Here, 
we are not talking about Scrum per se but applying Agile methods to projects: small, 
semi-autonomous teams; iterative development; customer engagement; experimenta￾tion; and continuous improvement.
Agile PM is often used upfront during the defining phase to resolve scope questions 
and define key requirements. An Agile team may be used to develop demonstrations of 
three different interfaces to a client so that this decision can be integrated into the proj￾ect plan. In essence, IDEO (see Snapshot of Practice 15.1: IDEO: Masters of Design) 
uses rapid prototyping and iterative development to define key design requirements 
which are later refined and created by traditional project management methods.
There are also projects where the requirements are known but there is uncertainty 
regarding how to accomplish (technology) it. In these cases, early in the project execu￾tion phase project teams are assigned the task of conducting experiments and build￾ing prototypes to test key assumptions and find solutions to technical problems. The 
results provide the necessary information so that traditional project execution can pro￾ceed. For example, in the ever-competitive e-vehicle world, automakers often experi￾ment with 2–3 different battery configurations before deciding which one to use.
Often on projects most of the work is routine and predictable, but there is uncer￾tainty regarding a specific deliverable or task. For example, a construction company 
secured the contract to build a new facility at a university. The firm had successfully 
completed similar projects in the past, but there was always a question of which sealing 
Final PDF to printerlar60886_ch15_573-600.indd 592 09/28/23 07:43 am
592 Chapter 15 Agile Project Management
compound to use given weather conditions. While the building was being constructed 
according to plan, the contractor conducted small-scale installation experiments on 
the ground to determine the best method and uncover issues early while there was still 
plenty of time to resolve them. Sometimes traditional PM is used at the tail end of an 
Agile project. For example, Scrum may be used to develop a company-wide database 
system, but traditional PM is used to manage the training of 1,000+ users.
Some companies have successfully applied hybrid project management on large proj￾ects that combine waterfall and Agile methods. For example, IPC Media, a subsidiary of 
Time Inc., uses an iterative waterfall approach in which large projects are broken down 
into sub-projects performed by different teams in parallel. Short sprints and additional 
checkpoints are used to complete each phase. In essence, each phase is an agile project.
Finally, it is common to find teams using Agile techniques on plan-driven projects. 
For example, stand-up meetings to coordinate efforts have become commonplace in 
many organizations. Teams also use shorter iterations and retrospectives to get critical 
customer feedback. Kanban methods are used by traditional teams to visualize work 
and identify bottlenecks in the project schedule. This trend is expected to continue. A 
2021 survey of project professionals across a wide range of North American industries 
reported that 23 percent were using a hybrid approach on their projects (PMI, 2021). 
We expect blended forms of project management to continue to evolve. Hopefully, 
someone will come up with a better name than simply “hybrid project management.”
Summary Agile Project Management has emerged as a response to the challenges of managing 
projects with loosely defined scopes and high levels of uncertainty. Agile relies on an 
iterative, incremental development process in which the scope of the project evolves 
over time. Development teams create feature-driven working products at the end of 
each development cycle. Active customer involvement is used to guide this process. 
Here are some of the key advantages of Agile methods:
∙ Work is divided into smaller and smaller chunks that are more easily scheduled and 
controlled.
∙ Collaboration between the customer and designers is increased, leading to solid 
change control.
∙ Methods demand that features be tested and functional when completed.
Agile PM is still evolving. While much of the attention in this chapter has been 
devoted to software development, Agile PM is being successfully applied to a wide 
range of unpredictable projects. New methods and approaches will continue to be 
developed and adapted to meet the specific needs of projects. Stay tuned.

Project A
You’ve just taken over a project from another project manager and have come back 
from a very uncomfortable meeting with your business sponsor. In the meeting, the 
Exercises

sponsor told you how dissatisfied she is with the project’s performance to date and that 
she’s getting ready to pull the plug on the project entirely. Deadlines keep slipping, the 
application isn’t complete, and the sponsor feels like she can’t get in touch with anyone 
to give her an update on the project’s status and progress.
From conversations with your project team, you learn that requirements still haven’t 
been finalized, and the team is waiting for input before being able to proceed on sev￾eral key parts of the application. Despite that, they’ve been able to push forward in 
other areas and are quite proud of the work they’ve done. However, they haven’t had a 
chance to show it to the sponsor.
To complicate matters further, your boss has made it clear that this project must be 
completed on schedule, because he needs the resources for another project.
What do you do? What impact do your decisions have on the project’s cost, sched￾ule, and performance?
Project B
Your project team has finished gathering the requirements and developing the solu￾tion design. Your team is broken into two main groups: the first group consists of the 
project manager, business analysts, and management and is located in the United 
States. The second group consists of the development and QA teams and they are 
located in India.
The WBS was developed based on estimates from the teams in India. The develop￾ment team agreed to provide daily updates to you about progress against the WBS to 
make sure that the project’s milestones are going to be met.
However, by the time the development team got close to the first milestone, it 
became obvious that they were behind, even though their daily updates indicated that 
they were on track. In addition, the team adopted a different design approach than the 
one agreed upon at the beginning of the project.
The lack of meaningful updates from the development team along with a different 
design track has jeopardized the whole project by rendering the entire plan obsolete. 
Your team is now at risk of not delivering the project.
What do you do? What is the impact to cost, schedule, and performance?
Project C
You have just taken over as the program manager of a large program with multiple 
tracks and a go-live scheduled in three months. At the first meeting with the project 
sponsors and key stakeholders, you find out that the business requirements are not 
complete and in some cases not started, the project scope is not realistic to meet the 
upcoming go-live, and overall the project teams are confused due to lack of communi￾cation and understanding of priorities.
What do you do? What impact do your decisions have on the project’s cost, sched￾ule, and performance?
Project D
You’ve just been assigned to take over a new project from an outgoing project man￾ager. The project is a high-visibility project that is using a development methodology 
that is new to you and to your company. In your transition meetings with the outgoing 
project manager, he assures you that development is complete and all you have to do is 
shepherd the project through acceptance testing and release. As a result, several proj￾ect team members were released as scheduled.
The acceptance testing does not go as smoothly as planned. The application has 
more defects than anticipated, and some core functionality is not able to be tested. The

project team doesn’t feel they are getting the direction they need to continue moving 
forward, and the business sponsor has asked you when she can expect to test applica￾tion functionality that wasn’t a part of the original scope. In addition, your project’s 
deadline is rapidly approaching, and interproject dependencies make it unlikely that 
you will be able to push your launch date.

Case 15.1
Introducing Scrum at P2P
PART A
Kendra Hua worked for six years as a software engineer in the IT Department at 
Point 2 Point (P2P), a large freight moving company. She liked her job and the peo￾ple she worked with. While she did some maintenance work, she worked primarily 
on projects, usually full time. Her work covered a wide range of projects, including 
system upgrades, inventory control, GPS tracking, billing, and customer databases. 
These projects were typically able to meet project requirements but were consistently 
late. Within the IT Department, it was common practice for a betting pool to emerge

Chapter 15 Agile Project Management 597
regarding completion dates. The rule of thumb was to take the original schedule, mul￾tiply it by 1.5, and start guessing from then on.
Management decided to try to turn things around by changing the way P2P com￾pleted IT projects. Instead of the traditional waterfall approach in which all the 
requirements were defined up front, the IT Department was to start using Agile Project 
Management, and more specifically Scrum, to complete their projects.
Kendra had just been assigned to the Big Foot project, which involved developing a 
system for monitoring P2P’s carbon footprint. To prepare for this project, Kendra and 
her entire team of software engineers would attend a two-day Scrum workshop.
Everyone was given a book on Scrum to prepare for the workshop. At first, Kendra 
was overwhelmed by terminology—Scrum master, sprints, product manager, sprint 
logs, and so forth. She questioned the rugby metaphor, since the only thing she knew 
about the sport was that one of her ex-boyfriends in college would come back to 
the dorm inebriated and bloodied after a match. And why was the project manager 
called a master? It seemed demeaning to her. Still, she had heard some good things 
about Scrum from a friend who was using it in another company. He claimed it gave 
programmers more freedom to do their work and to work at a faster pace. So she 
approached the two-day workshop with an open mind.
The workshop was facilitated by a trainer who was well versed in the world of soft￾ware development. Participants included her other five team members as well as Prem 
Gupta, a veteran project manager who would now assume the role of Scrum master, 
and Isaac Smith, who would act as the product manager representing the interests of the 
customers. At first, everyone gave Prem a hard time by bowing to him, pleading “mas￾ter, master, master . . .” The facilitator quickly corrected them by saying he was not their 
master but, rather, master of the Scrum process. The facilitator went on to emphasize 
that they would work as a self-organizing team. Kendra wasn’t exactly sure what that 
meant, but she felt it had something to do with the team managing itself, not Prem.
The workshop covered all the basic Scrum tools, concepts, and roles. Everyone got 
to practice the process by completing a simulated project involving the creation of a 
new board game. Kendra liked the idea of the standing Scrum meeting, since most 
of her meetings at P2P took way too long. She also liked having the product man￾ager, who was the ultimate decision maker on features and when work was completed. 
Everyone laughed at the “only one neck to wring” analogy that the facilitator used to 
describe this role. Overall she thought the process had promise and she was excited 
about trying it out on the Big Foot project. The Big Foot project was estimated to be 
completed after five sprints, with each sprint lasting four weeks.
THE FIRST SPRINT
The first sprint planning meeting went pretty much by the book. Isaac, the product 
owner, had done his homework and came to the meeting with a comprehensive list 
of features the software needed to provide. There was healthy discussion, and Isaac 
amended the list to include some features that the team felt was necessary. The afternoon 
session featured Isaac prioritizing the features in the product backlog with feedback 
from the team. The final segment was devoted to the team deciding among themselves 
which high-priority features they would commit to build within the four-week sprint. 
Prem did a good job of reminding the team that they were expected to build a fully 
functional feature. This tempered the team’s enthusiasm, and in the end, a challenging 
but doable set of features was assigned to the sprint backlog for the first sprint.
The first couple of daily Scrum meetings were a bit awkward as members were careful 
not to step on each other’s toes. One of the first impediments identified was not having 
Final PDF to printerlar60886_ch15_573-600.indd 598 09/28/23 07:43 am
598 Chapter 15 Agile Project Management
a shared understanding of how a self-organizing team worked. Prem kept emphasizing 
that it was up to the team to decide who does what and when. Then one morning it just 
suddenly clicked and members came forward claiming work they felt needed to be done. 
After that the daily Scrums took on a life of their own, interrupted only when a member 
had to do five push-ups for every minute late. The pace of work picked up, and there was 
a shared enthusiasm as tasks and ultimately functional features were completed in rapid 
fashion. Kendra worked side by side with the other software engineers to solve problems 
and share what they had learned. Occasionally Isaac was called into the project room to 
answer questions about specific features and be shown work in progress.
By the time of the first sprint review meeting, the team was able to demonstrate all 
but one of the designated features to Isaac and even three more that were not on the 
initial hit list. The team got some useful feedback not only from Isaac but also from a 
couple of the end users he brought with him. Eighty percent of the features were pro￾claimed done by Isaac, while the others needed only slight modifications. Everyone 
agreed that the next Sprint review would be even more successful.
The sprint retrospective meeting was refreshing, as members spoke candidly about 
both the good and the bad. Everyone agreed that the team needed to do a better job 
at documentation. Issues regarding fairness and spreading both the fun work and the 
tough work among the entire team were brought to the surface. Kendra was impressed 
by how everyone focused on what was best for the project, not just himself or herself.
THE SECOND SPRINT
The second sprint meeting went well. The features that needed rework after the first 
sprint review meeting were at the top of the backlog. Isaac made appropriate adjust￾ments in priorities, and a couple of new features that were discovered during the sprint 
review meeting were added. The meeting convened with the team confident that they 
would be able to complete the work they had committed to.
Project work progressed quickly over the next week. Kendra felt pressure to accom￾plish what she had said she would at the daily Scrum. At the same time, she felt a tre￾mendous amount of satisfaction reporting work done. The entire team seemed energized. 
Then one day everything came to a standstill over a sticky integration problem. The team 
struggled over the next three days, trying to solve the problem, until, at the next Scrum, 
Prem stepped forward, saying, “I think you should do this. . . .” He then proceeded to out￾line a specific method for solving the problem, even assigning specific tasks to each team 
member. During the next two days, Prem went back and forth between team members, 
coordinating their work and solving problems. While there was some grumbling within 
the team, his solution worked, and Kendra was grateful to get back on track.
From then on, Prem took a more active role in daily Scrum meetings, often having 
the final say as to the work agenda for that day. The meetings took on a different tone 
as members waited for Prem to speak first. Isaac was absent from the project room 
during this time, as he was visiting sites that would be using the new software. Still, 
features were being completed and Kendra was happy with the progress. Then one day 
Isaac showed up at the morning Scrum meeting. He had just gotten back and had fresh 
information he wanted to introduce into the project. He had rewritten the product log 
and added several new high-priority features and eliminated a few of the features that 
the team had been working on. He wanted the team to shift their efforts and complete 
the new features by the end of the sprint.
The team was shocked because one of the principles they had been taught is that 
you don’t change course midway through a sprint. Prem did his best to explain this 
to Isaac, but he was insistent. He kept saying that these changes had to be made; 
Final PDF to printerlar60886_ch15_573-600.indd 599 09/28/23 07:43 am
Chapter 15 Agile Project Management 599
otherwise, much of the sprint output would be a waste of time. He kept repeating 
that the team needed to be flexible. “After all, isn’t that what the Agile approach is all 
about?” The meeting came to an impasse until Prem came forward with a compromise. 
The team would agree to do the new work, but the sprint needed to be extended by two 
weeks. Everyone agreed and Kendra went back to work.
Up until the end of the second sprint, Prem continued to direct project work. When 
it came for the sprint review meeting, four of the five new features were completed 
as well as most of the original features. However, the feature demonstrations did not 
go well. Isaac and several of the end users that were present were critical of the user 
friendliness of several of the completed features. Kendra and other team members 
defended their work by saying, “Why didn’t you tell us you wanted it to perform that 
way?” Prem did his best to keep the meeting under control, but the team had little to 
say when an important feature simply did not work. In the end, only half of the features 
were accepted as being done.
Kendra walked out of the sprint review discouraged. Tomorrow morning was the 
sprint retrospective meeting. She had a lot on her mind but wasn’t sure what she should 
say or how to say it at the meeting.
1. How well is Scrum working?
2. What are the issues confronting the Big Foot project?
3. Assume you are Kendra. What would you want to say at the retrospective? How 
would you say it?
4. What improvements or changes need to be made?
PART B
Prem opened the retrospective by saying he had gotten a call from his boss and she 
was not happy with the progress. Prem said that he and the team were under the gun to 
get back on track. The list of things that went well during the second sprint was short, 
and when it came time to discuss improvements there was an awkward silence. Kendra 
spoke up and began by saying she had gone back and reviewed the Scrum book. She 
went on to say that she thought the whole idea behind Scrum was that the team was 
to work to solve their own problems and it wasn’t Prem’s role to play task master. A 
couple of other team members murmured agreement. Prem became defensive and said 
if he had not intervened it would have taken days for the team to solve the problem.
Another member said he thought it was a mistake allowing Isaac to change the 
sprint commitments. Prem agreed that in principle that was true but said sometimes 
you have to bend the rules to do what is right. He admonished the team by saying that 
they had to practice being more agile. The retrospective ended with few specific rec￾ommendations other than that in order to get back on track, Prem felt he would have to 
get even more involved in the execution of the project.
The subsequent sprint 3 planning meeting was more of a formality. Isaac updated 
the product backlog with revised priorities, and Prem signed off for the team as to 
what they would commit to. There was little interaction between the team and Isaac 
except seeking clarification on performance requirements for specific features.
The team met under Prem’s leadership for their daily Scrums. Sometimes the 
Scrums went beyond the normal 15 minutes as Prem reviewed progress and described 
in detail what needed to be done that day. Isaac showed up occasionally, changed 
priorities, reviewed work, and answered questions. Kendra worked hard on her assign￾ments and often received praise from Prem for work well done.

One evening when the team got together for a few beers and sushi, one of the team 
members pulled out a spreadsheet and asked who wanted to make the first bet on when 
they thought the project would be done.
After several sprints, Isaac finally signed off on the last feature and declared the 
project completed. A collective “yahoo” sprang from the team. After the meeting 
Kendra went around collecting money from each of her teammates—she had predicted 
that the project would take 12 weeks longer than planned.

Scrum?

Case 15.2
Graham Nash
Ken Buttrey scratched his head as he looked over an e-mail from John Barbata. Ken 
was the team lead on the Jasper Jones project. He and 13 other developers were 
charged with creating Jasper Jones (JJ), a new character to appear in the next edition 
of the popular video game Hidden Galaxy. Hidden Galaxy was the flagship game for 
NYAS Games. The team was cross-functional and included designers, artists, writers, 
engineers, QA, and producers. NYAS has applied Agile methods to its projects for the 
past three years, believing it to be one of the keys to its continued success.
For the most part, Ken was happy with the team and how things were going on 
the project. There was one big exception: graphic designer Graham Nash. In fact, the 
e-mail he was reading was another complaint about Graham: 
This is the second time in two weeks that Nash failed to report changes he made in JJ’s 
mobility. This really screws things up. I had to spend most of yesterday adjusting the sound 
to accommodate the changes.
Unfortunately, this was not the only complaint. Callie Faries, an artist, had just left 
Ken’s cubicle with a similar complaint.
Graham had a reputation at NYAS of being a brilliant designer. He was credited 
with the creation of the popular Thongor character. In fact, Ken was surprised that his 
counterpart, Xien Xong, was willing to let him go and work on JJ.
Ken admitted that at times Graham’s work could be brilliant and his work ethic was 
above reproach. But that was part of the problem. He would get so absorbed in his 
work that he would forget about the rest of the team. This issue kept being raised at the 
sprint reviews. Graham would agree while making little eye contact with the rest of the 
team. It didn’t help that Graham was an extreme introvert. Rarely did he say anything 
unless he was asked a question. You have talked to him about being more responsive 
to the needs of the rest of the team. You also have gotten into the habit of asking him 
specific questions at the daily stand-up meetings.
1. What options does Ken have in dealing with the Graham Nash situation?
2. What would you recommend Ken do and why?

The principal benefit of living abroad is that it enables us to get glimpses 
of ourselves as others see us and to realize that others’ views are more 
accurate than ours. Progress begins with grasping the truth about our￾selves, however unpleasant it may be.
—Russel Ackoff, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania
Thanks to technology we live in a “flat world” in which more and more projects have 
an international element. It might be being sent to Zimbabwe for nine months as a 
lead contractor on a bridge construction project or flying back and forth across the 
Atlantic to work on a joint product venture with German engineers. Or it might be 
relying on a Korean computer supplier on a business expansion project or video con￾ferencing with an Indian counterpart on a software project. This chapter targets the 
international project manager who must resettle in a foreign land to manage a project. 
The chapter also provides useful information for professionals whose project work 
requires interacting either directly or virtually with foreign counterparts from around 
the world.
There is no generally accepted framework or road map for project managers 
given overseas assignments. These project managers typically face a difficult set of 
problems—for example, absence from home, friends, and sometimes family; personal 
risks; missed career opportunities; foreign language, culture, and laws; and adverse 
conditions. Of course, there are positives—for example, increased income, increased 
responsibilities, career opportunities, foreign travel, and new lifetime friends. How the 
international project manager adapts and approaches challenges encountered in the 
host country often determines the success or failure of a project.
This chapter focuses on four major issues surrounding the management of inter￾national projects. First, major environmental factors that impact project selection and 
implementation are briefly highlighted. Second, an example of how organizations 
decide where to expand globally is provided. Third, the challenge of working in a

foreign culture is addressed. Finally, how companies select and train professionals for 
international projects is discussed. Although by no means comprehensive, this chapter 
provides an understanding of the major issues and challenges confronting managers 
working abroad on projects. Much of this information is also useful to those working 
from a distance with foreign counterparts.
16.1 Environmental Factors
The major challenge international project managers face is the reality that what works 
at home may not work in a foreign environment. Too often project managers impose 
practices, assumed to be superior, from their home country on host-country nationals 
without questioning their applicability to the new environment. Although there are 
similarities between domestic and international projects, management practices vary 
across nations and cultures. It is these differences that can turn an international project 
into a nightmare. If potential international project managers have a good awareness of 
differences in the host country’s environment from their own domestic environment, 
the dangers and obstacles of the global project can be reduced or avoided. There are 
several basic factors in the host country’s environment that may alter how projects will 
be implemented: legal/political factors, security, geography, economic factors, infra￾structure, and culture (see Figure 16.1). 
Legal/Political Factors
Expatriate project managers should operate within the laws and regulations of the 
host country. Political stability and local laws strongly influence how projects will be 
implemented. Typically these laws favor the protection of the local workers, suppliers, 
and environment. For example, how much control will be imposed from government 
agencies? What is the attitude of federal and state bureaucracies toward regulations 
and approval policies that can cause project delays? How much government interfer￾ence or support can one expect? For example, some governments interpret regulations 
arbitrarily, depending upon personal interests.
The constraints imposed by national and local laws need to be identified and 
adhered to. Are local ecological laws restrictive? Will manufacturing a new product in 
a computer chip plant require exporting toxic waste materials? What are the pollution 
standards? How will labor laws affect the use of local workers to complete the project?

Given that laws that affect business vary widely across countries, qualified legal assis￾tance is essential.
Government corruption is a part of international business. In China, various forms 
of obligatory “profit sharing” with city officials in the Hainan province have been 
reported. Employment of relatives, donations, and other “favors” are an expected 
cost of doing business in that region. A 2022 European Union (EU) study reported 
that 98 percent of Greek citizens believe corruption is “widespread” in their country. 
Conversely, just 16 percent of those in Denmark believe that corruption is rampant in 
their country (Friedman, 2022).
Political stability is another key factor in deciding to implement a project in a for￾eign country. What are the chances that there will be a change in the party in power 
during the project? Are the tax provisions and government regulations stable or subject 
to change with the winds of political change? How are laws made, and what is the past 
record of fairness? How are labor unions treated in the political realm? Does labor 
unrest exist? Is there a chance for a coup d’état? Contingency plans need to be estab￾lished to respond to emergencies.
Security
International terrorism is a fact of life in today’s world. Tim Daniel, chief operating 
officer of International SOS Assistance, Inc., reported that the number of his firm’s cli￾ents doubled after September 11th. SOS is a security firm that specializes in evacuating 
expatriates from dangerous situations around the world. The company cites Pricewater￾houseCoopers, Nortel Networks Corp., and Citigroup among its clients (Scown, 1993).
Crime is another factor. The growing presence of the Russian Mafia has discour￾aged many foreign firms from setting up operations in Russia. And piracy is a threat 
off the coast of Somalia and other parts of the Indian Ocean. Kidnapping of American 
professionals is also a threat in many parts of the world.
Security nationally involves the capacity of a country’s military and police forces 
to prevent and respond to attacks. In many foreign countries, American firms have to 
augment the countries’ security system. For example, it is common practice to hire 
tribal bodyguards in such places as Angola and Uzbekistan.
Another cost associated with terrorism is the ease of commerce across borders. 
Heightened security measures have created border congestions that have expanded the 
time and cost of moving personnel, materials, and equipment across countries. These 
constraints need to be factored into the budget and schedule of projects.
Risk management is always a vital part of project management. It plays an even big￾ger role in managing projects overseas. For example, Strohl Systems Group, a global 
leader in recovery-planning software and services, includes the following among the 
questions they use to evaluate vulnerability to terrorism: Have you included possible 
terrorist targets (facilities and personnel) in your hazard and vulnerability analysis? 
Have you conducted a counterterrorism exercise complete with law enforcement, fire, 
medical, and emergency management participation? What should your organization’s 
policy be on negotiating with a person threatening a terrorist act?1
Managing projects in a dangerous world is a tough assignment. Security precau￾tions are major cost considerations not only in dollars and cents but also in the psy￾chological well-being of personnel sent abroad. Effective risk management is critical.

Geography
One factor that is often underestimated until project personnel actually arrive at a for￾eign destination is the geography of the country. Imagine what it is like to deplane 
from a modern aircraft and encounter the 105-degree heat and 90 percent humidity of 
Jakarta, Indonesia, or 3 feet of fresh snow and −22-degree temperatures in Kokkola, 
Finland. Whether it is the wind, the rain, the heat, the jungle, or the desert, more than 
one project manager has asserted that the greatest challenge was overcoming the “ele￾ments.” Mother Nature cannot be ignored.
The planning and implementation of a project must take into account the impact 
the country’s geography will have on the project. For example, a salvage operation 
off the coast of Greenland can only be scheduled one month out of the year because 
the waterway is frozen over during the remainder of the year. Construction projects 
in Southeast Asia have to accommodate the monsoon season, when rainfall can be as 
high as 50 inches per month.
Geography does not just affect outdoor projects. It can have an indirect effect on 
“indoor” projects as well. For example, one information systems specialist reported 
that his performance on a project in northern Sweden declined due to sleep depriva￾tion. He attributed his problems to the 20 hours of daylight this part of the world expe￾riences during summer months.
Finally, extreme weather conditions can make extraordinary demands on equip￾ment. Projects can grind to a halt because of equipment breakdown under the brunt of 
the wind and sand. Working under extreme conditions typically requires special equip￾ment, which increases the costs and complexity of the project.
Before beginning a project in a foreign land, project planners and managers need 
to study carefully the unique characteristics of the geography of that country. They 
need to factor into project plans and schedules such items as climate, seasons, altitude, 
and natural geographical obstacles. See Snapshot from Practice 16.1: The Filming of 
Apocalypse Now for an example of a poorly planned endeavor in the Philippines.
Economic Factors
Basic economic factors in foreign countries and regions influence choices of site selec￾tion and project success. The gross domestic product (GDP) of a country suggests that 
country’s level of economic development. A faltering economy may indicate fewer 
sources of capital funding. Changes in protectionist strategies of a host country, such 
as import quotas and tariffs, can quickly alter the viability of projects. Other factors 
such as balance of payments, taxation, labor laws, safety regulations, and market size 
can influence project choices and operations.
The skills, access to education, and labor supply prevalent in a host country can 
determine the choice of a project site. Is project selection driven by low wage levels 
or the availability of technically skilled talent? For example, one can hire three com￾puter programmers in Ukraine for the price of one programmer in the United States. 
Conversely, many high-tech companies are willing to endure the additional expense of 
setting up joint projects in Switzerland and Germany to take advantage of their engi￾neering prowess.
Financial exposure is a significant risk for many international projects. Let’s look 
first at the potential impact of currency fluctuations on project success. For example, 
a U.S. contractor agrees to build a customized product for a German client. The prod￾uct will be built in the United States. The contractor estimates that the project will 
cost $925,000 and, in order to earn a nice profit, prices the project at $1 million. To

In February 1976, Francis Ford Cop￾pola took his Hollywood film crew to 
the Philippines to shoot Apocalypse 
Now, a film adaptation of Joseph 
Conrad’s Heart of Darkness within the 
context of the Vietnam conflict. The Philippines was 
chosen because the terrain was similar to Vietnam’s, 
and the government was willing to rent out its helicop￾ter force for the movie. At the time, the U.S. military 
was unwilling to cooperate on a film about Vietnam. 
An additional advantage was cheap labor. Coppola was 
able to hire more than 300 laborers at $1 to $3 per day 
to construct elaborate production sets, including an 
impressive Cambodian temple. Apocalypse Now was 
scheduled for 16 weeks of shooting at a budget of $12 
to $14 million.
Months earlier, George Lucas, of Star Wars fame, 
warned Coppola against filming the movie in the 
Philippines. He said, “It’s one thing to go over there 
for three weeks with five people and scrounge some 
footage with the Filipino Army, but if you go over there 
with a big Hollywood production, the longer you stay 
the more in danger you are of getting sucked into the 
swamp.” His words turned out to be prophetic.
A civil war was going on between government 
forces and communist rebels. Shooting was repeatedly 
interrupted because the Philippine military ordered 
their helicopter pilots to leave the set and fly to the 
mountains to fight the rebels.
In May 1976, a typhoon struck the Philippine 
Islands, destroying most of the movie sets. The film 
SNAPSHOT FROM PRACTICE 16.1 The Filming of Apocalypse Now*
team was forced to shut down production and returned 
to the United States for two months.
The lead character was played by Martin Sheen, 
who suffered a serious heart attack under the stress 
and heat of the filming and had to return to the United 
States. Coppola scrambled to film the scenes that did 
not require Sheen, but eventually production came to a 
standstill until Sheen’s return nine weeks later.
To make matters worse, actor Marlon Brando 
showed up greatly overweight, which was totally out 
of character with the rogue Green Beret he was to 
portray. Coppola admitted that Brando was too fat to 
play the scenes as written in the original script. Under 
immense pressure, Coppola struggled to come up with 
an ending for his film.
The entire project proved to be a traumatic experi￾ence for Coppola, who had enjoyed Academy Award 
success with his previous Godfather movies. “There 
were times when I thought I was going to die, literally, 
from the inability to move the problems I had. I would 
go to bed at four in the morning in a cold sweat.”
Film production ended in May 1977 after more 
than 200 days of shooting. The final cost was about 
$30 million.
Apocalypse Now opened in August 1979 to mixed 
reviews, then ultimately critical acclaim. The American 
Film Institute ranked the movie as the 30th greatest 
film of all time. The theatrical release grossed over $82 
million worldwide.

Pictures, 1991).
accommodate the German buyer the price is converted to euros. Suppose at the time of 
the contract the exchange rate is $1.15 per euro, and the price specified in the contract 
is €869,566.
Ten months later the project is completed as expected, with work costing the esti￾mated $925,000, and the customer pays the agreed-upon price of €869,566. However, 
the exchange rate has changed; it is now $1.05 per euro. That being the case, the pay￾ment equates to €869,566 × 1.05 = $913,044. Instead of reaping a nice profit, the 
contractor suffers a $(913,044 − 925,000) = $−11,956 loss!
Companies can protect themselves against adverse currency fluctuations in a num￾ber of related ways. First, they can hedge against this risk by having all parties agree 
to finalize the deal and make payments at a specified future date. Finance people call 
this a forward exchange or contract. Second, they can stipulate in the contract certain 
conditions based on exchange rates to ensure their profit margin. Finally, many mul￾tinational companies who do business in the client country avoid currency exchange

and simply use local currency to manage operations in that country. Financiers refer to 
this as a natural hedge (Moffet, Stonehill, & Eiteman, 2012).
Inflation is another significant risk. One of the greatest strengths of the U.S. econ￾omy is its relatively low inflation rate (below 3 percent from 1990 to 2012). Other 
countries do not enjoy such stability. Rapid inflation can strike at any time and have a 
profound impact on project costs and profits. Suppose that an Italian contractor suc￾cessfully wins the bid to build a bridge for the Tanzanian government in East Africa. 
Work starts in 2010 and will be completed by the end of 2011. In 2010 the Tanzanian 
inflation ratio is less than 6 percent with an average inflation rate of 6.7 over the 
past decade. The contractor uses what she considers a conservative inflation rate of 
9 percent when estimating the costs of the project at 1,800,000 schillings (Tanzanian 
currency). In order to win the bid and enjoy a solid profit the agreed-upon price is 2 
million schillings.
Early in 2011, Tanzania experiences a sporadic rainfall, which, coupled with 
increased oil prices, causes the inflation rate to jump to over 20 percent! Suddenly 
costs of certain elements of the project increase dramatically and instead of garnering 
a nice profit the contractor barely breaks even. Companies can protect against inflation 
by tying costs to a strong currency such as the U.S. dollar, Kuwait dinar, or euro and/or 
negotiating cost-plus contracts (see Chapter 12 Appendix) with the client.
Bartering is a form of compensation that is still used by some countries and orga￾nizations. For example, one project in Algeria was paid in goat skins. The goat skins 
were eventually sold to an Italian manufacturer of gloves. A project along the Caspian 
Sea was paid for in oil. A small group of firms specializes in bartering for project 
contractors. These intermediaries charge a commission to sell the bartered goods (e.g., 
oil, diamonds, wheat) for the contractor. However, dealing with commodities can be a 
risky enterprise.
Infrastructure
Infrastructure refers to a country’s or community’s ability to provide the services 
required for a project. Infrastructure needs for a project include communication, trans￾portation, power, technology, and education systems. Power outages are common in 
many parts of the world. For example, India’s burgeoning economy came to a halt 
during the 2012 summer, when over 670 million people were without power for more 
than two days. In 2022, about 34 percent of Indian households reported not facing 
any power outages; however, 28 percent of the households (mostly in rural areas) 
reported power outages for up to two hours everyday (Statista, 2023). If reliable power 
is not sufficient, other alternatives need to be considered. For example, construction 
firms often rely on heavy diesel generators as backups on their projects. Software 
projects across borders are common today; however, they depend on reliable telecom￾munication networks. If a project depends on a high ratio of vendor suppliers, good 
roads, and other transportation modes such as air and seaports, a good infrastructure 
is imperative.
An example of a project that failed to take into account the needs and infrastructure 
of the host nation involved a U.S. company that was awarded the contract for building 
a hospital in Botswana. The local African officials wanted a “low-tech” healthcare 
facility that would take local traditions and conditions into consideration. Because 
their relatives generally accompanied patients, space had to be provided for them, too. 
Electricity was not reliably supplied, and it was doubtful whether well-educated doc￾tors would want to spend careers away from the city. Therefore, the locals wanted a 
hospital for basic care with minimum technology. The construction company doing

lar60886_ch16_601-636.indd 608 10/14/23 12:04 pm
the building, on the other hand, had a preconceived notion of what a hospital should 
be and was not going to be accused of building a second-rate facility. It built a modern 
hospital that could have stood in any U.S. city. The building was completed; however, 
even after several years it was not used because the electricity was not sufficient, the 
air conditioning could not be used, and doctors refused to live in the rural area (Adler 
& Gunderson, 2007).
Organizations must consider the needs of the families of the personnel they send 
overseas. Will the facilities and living conditions for the expatriate families place an 
undue hardship on them? Will schooling for children be available? The welfare and 
comfort of expatriate families play an important role in retaining good project manag￾ers and promoting their peak performance.
Culture
Visiting project managers must respect the customs, values, philosophies, and social 
standards of their host country. Global managers recognize that if the customs and 
sociocultural dimensions of the host country are not accommodated, projects will 
rarely succeed. Too many project audits and final reports of international projects 
reflect challenges and problems linked to cultural differences.
For most project managers, the biggest difference in managing an international proj￾ect is operating in a national culture where things are done differently. For example, 
most economically developed nations use the same project management techniques 
(CPM, risk analysis, trade-off analysis). However, how activity work is performed can 
be very different in the host country. For example, a backhoe is used to dig a trench in 
France, while 20 laborers are used to dig a similar trench in Ethiopia.
Will English be the operating language, or will the project manager need to be fluent 
in the foreign language? Will translation services be available and sufficient? Commu￾nication problems—because of language differences—often become a major problem 
in carrying out even simple tasks. Although translators can help tremendously, their 
use does not solve the communication problem completely, because something is lost 
in translation. For example, consider the disastrous consequences of differences in 
interpretations and expectations between the Brazilians and Americans highlighted in 
Snapshot from Practice 16.2: River of Doubt.
Will religious factors influence the project? For example, religious factors touched 
the spouse of a Scandinavian project manager responsible for building a water desali￾nation plant from seawater in a Middle East country. She was restricted to the liv￾ing compound for families of foreign guest workers. Going outside the compound to 
a nearby city meant covering her head, arms, and legs and being accompanied by 
another woman or, preferably, a man. A physical altercation in the city concerning her 
clothing was traumatic for her. She left the country and returned home. Her partner 
requested a transfer back home three months later. The loss of the original project 
manager set the project back three months.
Not only do project managers have to adapt to the culture of the host country, but 
often overseas projects require working with people from other different countries. 
For example, on a light rail project in the Philippines, an American firm was hired to 
oversee the interests of local real estate companies that were funding the project. The 
American project manager had to work with Czech representatives who were provid￾ing the rail equipment, Japanese engineers responsible for building the rail, Australian 
bankers who were providing additional financing, and an Indian firm that provided the 
principal architects, as well as the native Filipinos.

After his crushing election defeat in 
1912 as a third-party candidate, former 
president Theodore (“Teddy”) Roosevelt 
set his sights on a grand adventure, the 
first descent of an unmapped, rapids￾choked tributary of the Amazon aptly titled the “River of 
Doubt.” Together with Brazil’s most famous explorer, Can￾dido Mariano da Silva Rondon, Roosevelt accomplished a 
feat that belongs in the annals of great expeditions.
Along the way, Roosevelt and his men faced an 
unbelievable series of hardships, losing their canoes 
and supplies to crushing whitewater rapids and endur￾ing starvation, attacks from indigenous groups, dis￾ease, drowning, and even murder within their ranks. 
Candice Millard brings alive these extraordinary events 
in her nonfiction thriller The River of Doubt. While her 
account details the ill-fated journey it also reveals 
insights into international project management as it 
describes the collaboration between the American 
and Brazilian cohorts. While each party ultimately 
earned the respect and admiration of the other, friction 
between them simmered from the outset.
One source of consternation was the amount of 
supplies and luggage that the Americans required for 
the journey. Warned that the luggage requirements 
of the former president and his party would be exten￾sive, the Brazilian commodore, Rondon, ordered 110 
mules and 17 pack oxen to be used for the expedi￾tion’s overland journey across the Brazilian highland 
to the great river. Surely, he felt, this would be more 
than necessary for such a trip.
The Brazilians were astounded by the sheer vol￾ume of baggage that was unloaded from Roosevelt’s 
ship, the Vandycks. There were mountains of crates: 
guns and ammunition, chairs and tables, tents and 
cots, and equipment for collecting and preserving 
specimens, surveying the river, and cooking meals. An 
exhausted stevedore elicited a roar of laughter from 
the onlooking crowd when he announced, “Nothing 
lacking but the piano!”
Rather than risk embarrassment by telling Roo￾sevelt that they were not prepared to take so much 
luggage, Rondon scrambled to find additional animals. 
Extra oxen and mules were located, but they were far 
from tame. Loaded with supplies, the oxen bucked and 
threw off the packs. The expedition was delayed as 
local cowboys endeavored to “break” the animals as 
quickly as possible.
Within days of finally setting off across the vast 
highlands, Roosevelt and his men began to experience 
the harsh realities that were to plague the expedition. 
After crossing a bone-strewn graveyard of oxen and 
mules that had starved to death or been eaten during 
previous expeditions, they were stunned by the sight of 
unopened supply crates, all clearly marked “Roosevelt 
South American Expedition.” The pack animals, still 
making their weary away across the plateau ahead of 
them, had begun bucking off their heavy loads!
As the officers rode slowly past the boxes, they 
wondered what they were leaving behind and how pre￾cious it might become in the months ahead. Little did 
they know how true those fears would be.
Six weeks into the expedition Roosevelt needed 
daily attention by the team’s physician to deal with a 
badly infected leg, which at times made him delirious. 
Ultimately the expedition cut short its mission. Roos￾evelt staggered out of the jungle having lost over 50 
pounds, and he would suffer from recurring bouts of 
jungle fever for the rest of his life.

Of all the factors, working within a multicultural environment is most often the 
greatest challenge for project managers. It will be dealt with in detail later in this

16.2 Project Site Selection
As project managers study the factors contributing to site selection, they will see 
that inherent in all of them is the risk level that senior management and directors are 
willing to accept for the potential rewards of a successful international project. One 
approach for the project manager to digest, clarify, and understand the factors leading 
to the selection of a specific project is to use a risk matrix similar to those found in 
Chapter 7.
Figure 16.2 presents a truncated matrix for project site selection of the construction 
of a laser printer factory in Singapore, India, or Ireland. In this example, political sta￾bility, worker skill and supply, culture compatibility, infrastructure, government sup￾port, and product-to-market advantage are the major assessment factors. Each project 
site is compared against each factor. Figure 16.3 depicts a further breakdown of the 
infrastructure evaluation factor. In this example, transportation, an educated work￾force, utilities, telecommunications, and vendor suppliers are considered important to 
evaluating the infrastructure for each site. The scores given in Figure 16.3 are used to

assign values to the infrastructure factor of the assessment matrix, Figure 16.2. In this 
project, Ireland is the choice. Clearly, Singapore and Ireland are very close in terms of 
infrastructure and several other factors. However, the major assessment factor of using 
Ireland to access the European economic community (product-to-market advantage) 
turned the decision.
 Given the macroeconomic factors, the firm’s strategic posture toward global proj￾ects, and the major considerations for selecting this project, it is imperative the project 
manager quickly become sensitized to the foreign cultural factors that can spell project 
success or failure.
16.3 Cross-Cultural Considerations: A Closer Look
The concept of culture was introduced in Chapter 3 as referring to the unique personal￾ity of a particular firm. More specifically, culture was defined as a system of shared 
norms, beliefs, values, and customs that bind people together, creating shared mean￾ing and a unique identity. Culture is a concept created for descriptive purposes and 
depends on the group that is the focus of attention. For example, within a global con￾text, culture can refer to certain regions (e.g., Europeans, Arabs), to specific nations 
(e.g., French, Thai), or to certain ethnic or religious groups (e.g., Kurds, African 
Americans). This chapter looks at national cultures; many cultural characteristics are 
borderless and there is considerable variation within any one country. Still, national 
cultures provide a useful anchor for understanding different habits, customs, and val￾ues around the world.
Right or wrong, Americans have a reputation for not being able to work effec￾tively in foreign cultures. (When we use the term American, we are referring to 
people from the United States.) In the 1960s, the term ugly American encapsulated 
the apparent indifference of Americans to native cultures when working or travel￾ing abroad. Americans are often criticized for being parochial; that is, they view 
the world solely through their own perspectives. People with a parochial perspec￾tive do not recognize that other people have different ways of living and work￾ing effectively. American parochial attitudes probably reflect the huge domestic 
market of the United States, the geographic isolation of the United States, and the 
reality that English is becoming the international business language in many parts 
of the world.
It is important that Americans working on international projects anticipate cultural 
differences. Take, for example, a project manager from a large North American con￾struction company who was given the responsibility for selecting a site for the design 
and construction of a large fish-processing plant in a West African country. The man￾ager assessed potential sites according to the availability of reliable power, closeness 
to transportation, nearness to the river for access of fishing boats from the Atlantic 
Ocean, proximity to main markets, and availability of housing and people for employ￾ment. After evaluating alternative sites, the project manager chose the optimum loca￾tion. Just prior to requesting bids from local contractors for some of the site preparation, 
the manager discovered, in talking to the contractors, that the site was located on 
ground considered sacred by the local people, who believed this site was the place 
where their gods resided. None of the local people upon whom the project manager 
was depending for staff would ever consider working there! The project manager 
quickly revised his choice and relocated the site. In this case, he was lucky that the

cultural gaffe was discovered prior to construction. Too often these errors are realized 
only after a project is completed.2
Some argue that Americans have become less parochial. International travel, immi￾gration, movies, and the popularity of such international events as the Olympics have 
made more Americans sensitive to cultural differences. While Americans may be 
more worldly, there is still a tendency for them to believe that American cultural val￾ues and ways of doing things are superior to all others. This ethnocentric perspective 
is reflected in wanting to conduct business only on their terms and stereotyping other 
countries as lazy, corrupt, or inefficient. Americans need to make a serious effort to 
appreciate other ways of approaching work and problems in other countries.
Finally, American project managers have earned a reputation abroad for being very 
good at understanding technology but not good at understanding people. As one Indone￾sian engineer put it, “Americans are great at solving technical problems, but they tend to 
ignore the people factor.” For example, Americans tend to underestimate the importance 
that relationship building plays in conducting business in other countries. Americans 
have a tendency to want to get down to work and let friendships evolve in the course of 
their work. In most other cultures just the opposite is true. Before foreigners work with 
you, they want to get to know you as a person. Trust is not established by credentials but, 
rather, evolves from personal interaction. Business deals often require a lengthy and elab￾orate courtship (Arms & Lucas, 1978; Chen & Miller, 2010). For example, it may take 
five to eight meetings before Arab managers are even willing to discuss business details.
Adjustments
Two of the biggest adjustments Americans typically have to make in working abroad 
are adapting to the general pace of life and the punctuality of people. In America “time 
is money,” and a premium is placed on working quickly. Other cultures do not share 
Americans’ sense of urgency and are accustomed to a much slower pace of life. They 
can’t understand why Americans are always in such a hurry. Punctuality varies across 
cultures. For example, Americans will generally tolerate someone being 5 to 10 min￾utes late. In contrast, among Peruvians, the period before an apology or explanation 
for being late is expected might be 45 minutes to an hour!
While working on multicultural projects, managers sometimes encounter ethical 
dilemmas that are culturally bound. For example, the 1999 Olympic site selection 
scandal featured the sordid details of committee members peddling their votes for a 
wide range of gifts (e.g., university scholarships for their children, extravagant trips). 
In many societies such “bribes” or “tributes” are expected and the only way to conduct 
meaningful business. Moreover, many cultures will not grant a female project manager 
the same respect they will a male project manager. Should U.S. management increase 
project risk or violate its own sex-discrimination policy?
These cultural differences are just the tip of the iceberg. There are numerous How 
to Do Business in . . . books written by people who have traveled and worked abroad. 
Although these books may lack rigor, they typically do a good job of identifying local 
customs and common mistakes made by outsiders. On the other hand, anthropologists 
have made significant contributions to our understanding of why and how the cultures 
of societies are different (see Research Highlights 16.1: Cross-Cultural Orientations 
and 16.2: Hofstede Framework). Students of international project management are

Anthropologists Kluckhohn and 
Strodtbeck assert that cultural varia￾tions reflect how different societies 
have responded to common issues 
or problems throughout time (see 
Figure 16.4). Five of the issues featured 
in their comparative framework are discussed here.
• Relationship to nature. This issue reflects how 
people relate to the natural world around them 
and to the supernatural. Should people domi￾nate their environment, live in harmony with it, 
or be subjugated to it? People from the United 
States generally strive to harness nature’s 
forces and change them as they need. Other 
societies, as in India, strive to live in harmony 
with nature. Still other societies see themselves 
at the mercy of physical forces and/or subject 
to the will of a supreme being. Life in this con￾text is viewed as predetermined, preordained, 
or an exercise in chance.
• Time orientation. Does the culture focus on the 
past, present, or future? For example, many 
European countries focus on the past and 
emphasize maintaining tradition. People from 
the United States, on the other hand, are less 
concerned with tradition and tend to focus 
on the present and near future. Paradoxically, 
Japanese society, while rich with tradition, has 
a much longer time horizon.
• Activity orientation. This issue refers to a desir￾able focus of behavior. Some cultures emphasize 
“being” or living in the moment. This orientation 
stresses experiencing life and seeking imme￾diate gratification. Other cultures emphasize 
“doing” and emphasize postponing immediate 
gratification for greater accomplishment. A third 
alternative is the “control” orientation, where 
people restrain their desires by detaching them￾selves from objects. The activity dimension 
affects how people approach work and leisure 
and the extent to which work-related concerns 
pervade their lives. It is reflected in the age-old 
question “Do we live to work or work to live?”
• Basic nature of people. Does a culture view 
people as good, evil, or some mix of these two? 
In many Southeast Asian countries, people see 
themselves as basically honest and trustworthy. 
Conversely, some Mediterranean cultures have 
been characterized as taking a rather evil view of 
human nature. North Americans are somewhere 
in between. They see people as basically good but 
stay on guard so as not to be taken advantage of.
• Relationships among people. This issue con￾cerns the responsibility one has for others. 
Americans, for instance, tend to be highly indi￾vidualistic and believe everyone should take 
care of themselves. In contrast, many Asian 
societies emphasize concern for the group or 
community they are members of. A third varia￾tion is hierarchical, which is similar to the group 
except that in these societies groups are hierar￾chically ranked, and membership is essentially 
stable over time. This is a characteristic of aris￾tocratic societies and caste systems.
The Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck framework provides 
a basis for a deeper understanding of cultural dif￾ferences. At the same time, they warn that not all 
members of a culture practice the same behavior all 
the time and, as in the United States, there is likely 
to be considerable variation within a given culture.

The Hofstede framework grew from 
a study of 88,000 people working 
in IBM subsidiaries in 50 countries 
and 3 multicountry regions. Based 
on responses to a 32-item question￾naire, Dutch social scientist Geert Hof￾stede developed different dimensions for examining 
cultures:
1. Individualism versus collectivism—identifies 
whether a culture holds individuals or the 
group responsible for each member’s welfare.
2. Power distance—describes the degree to which 
a culture accepts status and power differences 
among its members.
3. Uncertainty avoidance—identifies a culture’s 
willingness to accept uncertainty and ambiguity 
about the future.
4. Masculinity-femininity—describes the degree 
to which the culture emphasizes competitive 
and achievement-oriented behavior or displays 
concerns for relationships.
Figure 16.5 shows how he ranked selected 
countries according to collectivism-individualism 
and power distance. Wealth appears to influence 
both factors. Power distance is correlated with 
income inequality in a country, while individualism 
is correlated with national wealth (per capita gross 
national product). As a result, high power distance 
and collectivism are often found together, as are 
low power distance and individualism. This can 
affect decision making on project teams. For exam￾ple, while the high collectivism may lead a project 
team in Thailand to operate consensually, the high 
power distance may cause decisions to be heavily 
influenced by the desires of the project manager. 
Conversely, a similar team operating in a more indi￾vidualistic and low power distance context such as 
Great Britain or United States might make decisions 
with more open debate, including challenging the 
preferences of the project manager.

So what can be said to prepare people to work on international projects? The world 
is too diverse to do justice in one chapter to all the cultural variations managers are 
likely to encounter when working on international projects. Instead, a sample of some 
of these differences will be highlighted in this chapter by discussing working on proj￾ects in four countries: Mexico, France, Saudi Arabia, and China. We apologize to our 
readers outside the United States because briefings are presented from the viewpoint 
of a U.S. project manager working in these countries. Still, in an effort not to be too 
ethnocentric, we present a fifth scenario for foreign project managers assigned to work 
in the United States. We should also note that these cultural observations are based on

E-mailing is an important mode of 
communication, especially across 
continents and cultures. It is also an 
essential part of being a project pro￾fessional. There are, however, risks 
involved when sending e-mails across cultures because 
of miscommunication. Global business expert, Darren 
Menabney proposed several tips to help project profes￾sionals write effective cross-cultural e-mails.
PAY ATTENTION TO TITLES, NAMES, AND 
GENDER ISSUES.
If the receiver of your e-mail has a title and/or uses post 
name designations like Ph.D. or Professor, be sure to 
include these. If you have received an e-mail from this 
person before, use the same title and designations that 
were included in the received e-mail. In most very hier￾archical cultures, titles mean a lot and not using them 
can offend. If you are sending a first e-mail to some￾one whose gender preference is unknown, try to avoid 
gender-specific pronouns. Additionally, make it clear 
in your correspondence what gender your gender is if 
you are expecting a reply e-mail from them.
HOW TO CC.
Some cultures are ones in which a lot of individuals 
participate in decisions. This is especially true of Japan 
and South Korea. In these cultures, you will want to CC 
all who are involved. Leaving off someone who is a part 
of the reporting chain can offend them.
LOW-CONTEXT COMMUNICATION IS 
USUALLY BEST.
In some countries that are considered high-context cul￾tures (e.g., India, Brazil), a lot is being communicated 
by what is not being said. In low-context cultures (i.e.,
United States, Australia), the words and ideas speak for 
themselves. The classic example is while Americans 
feel comfortable saying “no,” people in high-context 
cultures avoid saying “no” but assume the recipient 
will figure it out. The implication is that it is better to 
assume a low-context culture by including more infor￾mation and being more explicit in your writing and the 
requests that you are asking from the recipient.
BE PERCEPTIVE ABOUT FRANKNESS OR 
BLUNTNESS.
It is important that you be considerate of your recipient in 
terms of how they might perceive your choice of words. 
In some cultures, disagreements are less open. In these 
cultures, your content must be more subtle, and less 
straightforward. There are significant differences among 
cultures as to the explicitness of written communication.
The overriding principle of cross-cultural e-mails 
is to imagine yourself as the recipient of the e-mail. 
How would your message be received in the context 
of the receiver’s culture? Do not impose your own cul￾tural norms on the receiver because they can be inter￾preted very differently by those from different cultures. 
Therefore, drop your assumptions, your idioms, and 
think from the perspective of the receiver, their culture, 
and their interpretation of your message. To do this, it 
becomes imperative that you learn about the receivers’ 
culture, their communication norms, etc. Determine 
what is the same and what is different about your way 
of expressing ideas, thoughts, and theirs.

significant differentiations about different countries, and there are always exceptions 
to the rule. Finally, although by no means exhaustive, these briefings provide a taste of 
what it is like to work in and with people from these countries.
Working in Mexico
The United States developed historically in an environment where it was important 
for strangers to be able to get along, interact, and do business. On the American 
frontier, almost everyone was a stranger, and people had to both cooperate and keep 
their distance. The New England Yankee sentiment “Good fences make good neigh￾bors”3
 expresses this American cultural value well. Conversely, Mexico developed 
3 This expression appears in Robert Frost’s poem “The Mending Wall” (1914).

lar60886_ch16_601-636.indd 616 10/14/23 12:04 pm
historically in an environment where the only people to trust were family and close 
friends—and by extension, people who were known to those whom you knew well. 
As a consequence, personal relationships dominate all aspects of Mexican business. 
While Americans are generally taught not to do business with friends, Mexicans and 
other Latin Americans are taught to do business with no one but friends.
The significance of personal relationships has created a compadre system in which 
Mexicans are obligated to give preference to relatives and friends when hiring, con￾tracting, procuring, and sharing business opportunities. People from Canada or the 
United States often complain that such practices contribute to inefficiency in Mexican 
firms. While this may or may not be the case, efficiency is prized by Americans, while 
Mexicans place a higher value on friendship.
Mexicans tend to perceive Americans as being “cold.” They also believe that most 
Americans look down on them. Among the most effective things an American can do 
to prevent being seen as a typical Gringo is to take the time and effort in the beginning 
of a working relationship to really get to know Mexican counterparts. Because fam￾ily is all-important to Mexicans, a good way for developing a personal relationship is 
exchanging information about each other’s family. Mexicans will often gauge people’s 
trustworthiness by the loyalty and attention they devote to their family.
The mañana syndrome reflects another cultural difference between Americans and 
Mexicans. Mexicans have a different concept of time than Americans do. Mexicans 
feel confined and pressured when given deadlines; they prefer open-ended schedules. 
They generally consider individuals to be more important than schedules. If a friend 
drops in at work, most Mexicans will stop and talk, regardless of how long it takes and 
even if chatting makes their work late. This sometimes contributes to the erroneous 
perception that Mexicans lack a work ethic.
Finally, as in many other cultures, Mexicans do not share Americans’ confidence 
that they control their own destiny. While Americans are taught “When the going gets 
tough, the tough get going,” Mexicans are taught “Taking action without knowing 
what is expected or wanted can have dangerous consequences.” Mexicans tend to be 
more cautious and want to spend more time discussing risks and potential problems 
that Americans might dismiss as improbable or irrelevant.
Other useful guidelines for working with Mexicans on projects include the following:
1. Americans tend to be impersonal and practical when making arguments; Mexicans 
can be very passionate and emotional when arguing. They enjoy a lively debate.
2. Where Americans tend to use meetings as the place to work things out publicly, 
Mexicans tend to see meetings as the place where persons with authority ratify 
what has been decided during informal private discussions.
3. While Mexicans can be emotional, they tend to shy away from any sort of direct con￾frontation or criticism. A long silence often indicates displeasure or disagreement.
4. Speech in Mexico is often indirect. People rarely say no directly but are more likely 
to respond by saying maybe (quizas), or by saying “I will think about it” or chang￾ing the subject. Yes (si) is more likely to mean “I understand you” than “yes.”
5. Titles are extremely important in Mexico and are always used when people are 
introducing themselves or being introduced. Pay as much attention to remembering 
a person’s title as to remembering their name.
Today, with the North American Free Trade Agreement and increased international 
business activity in Mexico, old traditions are disappearing. American managers 
report that cultural differences are less evident in northern Mexico, where many

multinational firms operate. There, hora americana (American time) rather than hora 
mexicana tends to be used when dealing with foreigners. Project managers should 
devote up-front effort to understanding how much older mores of Mexican culture 
apply to their project.4
Working in France
Some Americans consider the French the most difficult to work with among Europe￾ans. This feeling probably stems from a reflection of the French culture, which is quite 
different from that in the United States.
In France, one’s social class is very important. Social interactions are constrained 
by class standing, and during their lifetimes most French people do not encounter 
much change in social status. Unlike an American, who through hard work and suc￾cess might move from the lowest economic stratum to the highest, a successful French 
person might, at best, climb one or two rungs up the social ladder. Additionally, the 
French are very status conscious and like to provide signs of this status, such as knowl￾edge of literature and arts; a well-designed, tastefully decorated house; and a high 
level of education.
The French tend to admire or be fascinated with people who disagree with them; in 
contrast, Americans are more attracted to those who agree with them. As a result, the 
French are accustomed to conflict and, during negotiations, accept the fact that some 
positions are irreconcilable and must be accepted as such. Americans, on the other 
hand, tend to believe that conflicts can be resolved if both parties make an extra effort 
and are willing to compromise. Also, the French often determine a person’s trust￾worthiness based on their first-hand, personal evaluation of the individual’s character. 
Americans, in contrast, tend to evaluate a person’s trustworthiness on the basis of past 
achievements and other people’s evaluations.
The French are often accused of lacking an intense work ethic. For example, many 
French workers frown on overtime and, on average, have one of the longest vacations 
in the world (four to five weeks annually). On the other hand, the French enjoy a 
reputation for productive work, a result of the French tradition of craftsmanship. This 
tradition places a greater premium on quality than on getting things accomplished 
quickly.
Most French organizations tend to be highly centralized with rigid structures. As 
a result, it usually takes longer to carry out decisions. Because this arrangement 
is quite different from the more decentralized organizations in the United States, 
many U.S. project managers find the bureaucratic red tape a source of considerable 
frustration.
In countries like the United States, a great deal of motivation is derived from pro￾fessional accomplishments. The French do not tend to share this same view of work. 
While they admire American industriousness, they believe that quality of life is what 
really matters. As a result, they attach much greater importance to leisure time, and 
many are unwilling to sacrifice the enjoyment of life for a dedication to project work. 
Public demonstrations against raising the French pension age from 62 to 64 is an 
example of this. For many French, retirement is a golden time to travel and enjoy the 
good things in life.

Cautions to remember with the French include these:
1. The French value punctuality. It is very important to be on time for meetings and 
social occasions.
2. Great importance is placed on neatness and taste. When interacting with French 
businesspeople, pay close attention to your own professional appearance and appear 
cultured and sophisticated.
3. The French can be very difficult to negotiate with. Often, they ignore facts, no mat￾ter how convincing they may be. They can be quite secretive about their position. 
It is difficult to obtain information from them, even in support for their position. 
Patience is essential for negotiating with them.
4. French managers tend to see their work as an intellectual exercise. They do not share 
the American view of management as an interpersonally demanding exercise, where 
plans have to be constantly “sold” upward and downward using personal skills.
5. The French generally consider managers to be experts. They expect managers to 
give precise answers to work-related questions. To preserve their reputation, some 
French managers act as if they know the answers to questions even when they don’t.5
Working in Saudi Arabia
Project management has a long tradition in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries. 
Western interest in oil has contributed greatly to an influx of wealth and subsequent 
modernization of Arab countries. Despite this tradition, foreigners often find it very 
hard to work on projects in Saudi Arabia. A number of cultural differences can be 
cited for this difficulty.
One is the Arabian view of time. In the United States, it is common to use the cliché
“The early bird gets the worm.” In Saudi Arabia, a favorite expression is “Bukra insha 
Allah,” which means “Tomorrow if God wills,” an expression that reflects the Saudis’ 
approach to time. Unlike Westerners, who believe they control their own time, Arabs 
believe that Allah controls time. As a result, when Saudis commit themselves to a date 
in the future and fail to show up, there is no guilt or concern on their part because they 
have no control over time in the first place. In planning future events with Arabs, it 
pays to hold lead time to a week or less, because other factors may intervene or take 
precedence.
An associated cultural belief is that destiny depends more on the will of a supreme 
being than on the behavior of individuals. A higher power dictates the outcome of 
important events, so individual action is of little consequence. As a result, progress 
or the lack of progress on a project is considered more a question of fate than effort. 
This leads Saudis to rely less on detailed plans and schedules to complete projects than 
Americans do.
Another important cultural contrast between Saudi Arabians and Americans is 
emotion and logic. Saudis often act on the basis of emotion; in contrast, those in an 
Anglo culture are taught to act on logic. During negotiations, it is important not only 
to share the facts but also to make emotional appeals that demonstrate that your sug￾gestion is the right thing to do.

lar60886_ch16_601-636.indd 619 10/14/23 12:04 pm
Saudis also use elaborate and ritualized forms of greeting and leave-taking. A busi￾nessperson may wait far past the assigned meeting time before being admitted to a 
Saudi office. Once there, the individual may find a host of others present; one-on-one 
meetings are rare. Moreover, during the meeting there may be continuous interrup￾tions. Visitors arrive and begin talking to the host, and messengers may come in and 
go out on a regular basis. The businessperson is expected to take all this activity as 
perfectly normal and to remain composed and ready to continue discussions as soon as 
the host is prepared to do so.
Initial meetings are typically used to get to know the other party. Business-related 
discussions may not occur until the third or fourth meeting. Business meetings typi￾cally conclude with an offer of coffee or tea. This is a sign that the meeting is over and 
that future meetings, if there are to be any, should now be arranged.
Saudis attach a great deal of importance to status and rank. When meeting with 
them, defer to the senior person. It is also important never to criticize or berate anyone 
publicly. This causes the individual to lose face; the same is true for the person who 
makes these comments. Mutual respect is expected at all times.
Other useful guidelines for working in Saudi Arabia include the following:
1. It is important never to display feelings of superiority because this makes the other 
party feel inferior. No matter how well someone does something, the individual 
should let the action speak for itself and not brag or draw attention to themselves.
2. A lot of what gets done is a result of going through administrative channels in the 
country. It is often difficult to sidestep a lot of this red tape, and efforts to do so can 
be regarded as disrespect for legal and governmental institutions.
3. Connections are extremely important in conducting business. More important peo￾ple get fast service from less important people. Close relatives take absolute prior￾ity; nonrelatives are kept waiting.
4. Patience is critical to the success of business negotiations. Time for deliberations 
should be built into all negotiations to prevent a person from giving away too much 
in an effort to reach a quick settlement.
5. Important decisions are usually made in person, not by correspondence or tele￾phone. While Saudis seek counsel from many people, the ultimate power to make a 
decision rests with the person at the top, and this individual relies heavily on per￾sonal impressions, trust, and rapport.6
Working in China
In recent years the People’s Republic of China (PRC, or China for short) has moved 
away from isolation to encourage more business with the rest of the world. While 
China holds tremendous promise, many Western firms have found working on projects 
in China to be a long, grueling process that often results in failure. One of the primary 
reasons for problems is the failure to appreciate Chinese culture.
Chinese society, like those of Japan and Korea, is influenced by the teachings of 
Confucius (551–478 B.C.). Unlike America, which relies on legal institutions to regu￾late behavior, in Confucian societies the primary deterrent against improper or illegal 
behavior is shame or loss of face. Face is more than simply reputation. There is a 
Chinese saying: “Face is like the bark of a tree; without its bark, the tree dies.” Loss

Final PDF to printer620 Chapter 16 International Projects
lar60886_ch16_601-636.indd 620 10/14/23 12:04 pm
of face brings shame not only to individuals but also to family members. A member’s 
actions can cause shame for the entire family, hampering that family from working 
effectively in Chinese society.
In China, “whom you know is more important than what you know.” The term 
guanxi refers to personal connections with appropriate authorities or individuals. 
China observers argue that guanxi is critical for working with the Chinese. Chinese are 
raised to distrust strangers, especially foreigners. Trust is transmitted via guanxi. That 
is, a trusted business associate of yours must pass you along to their trusted business 
associates. Many outsiders criticize guanxi, considering it to be like nepotism, where 
decisions are made regarding contracts or problems based on family ties or connec￾tions instead of an objective assessment of ability.
Many believe that the quickest way to build guanxi relationships is through tender￾ing favors. Gift-giving, entertainment at lavish banquets, questionable payments, and 
overseas trips are common. While Westerners see this as nothing short of bribery, the 
Chinese consider it essential for good business. Another common method for outsiders 
to acquire guanxi is by hiring local intermediaries, who use their connections to create 
contacts with Chinese officials and businesspeople.
In dealing with the Chinese, you must realize they are a collective society in which 
people pride themselves on being a member of a group. For this reason, you should 
never single out a Chinese person for specific praise because this is likely to embarrass 
the individual in front of their peers. At the same time, you should avoid the use of “I” 
because it conveys that you are drawing attention to yourself.
Chinese people do not appreciate boisterous behavior, and when speaking to each 
other they maintain a greater physical distance than is typical in America. Other cau￾tions include the following:
1. Once the Chinese decide who and what is best, they tend to stick to their decisions. 
So while they may be slow in formulating a plan, once they get started they make 
good progress.
2. Reciprocity is important in negotiations. If Chinese people give concessions, they 
expect some in return.
3. The Chinese tend to be less animated than Americans. They avoid open displays of 
affection and physical contact; they are more reticent and reserved than Americans.
4. The Chinese place less value on the significance of time and often get Americans to 
concede concessions by stalling.
5. In Confucian societies, those in position of power and authority are obligated to 
assist the disadvantaged. In return, they gain face and a good reputation.7

Management X-Files.
Working in the United States
In the world of international projects, professionals from other countries will come to 
the United States to manage projects. To them, the United States is a foreign assign￾ment. They will have to adapt their management style to the new environment they

Immigration has made the United States a melting pot of diverse cultures. While 
many are quick to point out the differences between North and South, Silicon Valley 
and Wall Street, social anthropologists have identified certain cultural characteristics 
that shape how many Americans conduct business and manage projects.
Mainstream Americans are motivated by achievement and accomplishment. Their 
identity and, to a certain extent, their self-worth are measured by what they have 
achieved. Foreigners are often astounded by the material wealth accumulated by 
Americans and the modern conveniences most Americans enjoy. They are also quick 
to point out that Americans appear too busy to truly enjoy what they have achieved.
Americans tend to idolize the self-made person who rises from poverty and adversity 
to become rich and successful. Most Americans have a strong belief that they can influ￾ence and create their future, that with hard work and initiative, they can achieve what￾ever they set out to do. Self-determination and pragmatism dominate their approach to 
business.
Although Americans like to set precise objectives, they view planning as a means 
and not an end. They value flexibility and are willing to deviate from plans and impro￾vise if they believe change will lead to accomplishment. Obstacles on a project are 
to be overcome, not worked around. Americans think they can accomplish just about 
anything, given time, money, and technology.
Americans tend to discount the sig￾nificance of luck and believe that good 
fortune is generally a result of hard 
work. In other cultures, luck takes on 
greater significance and has supernat￾ural ramifications. For example, in many Asian cultures, 
certain numbers are considered lucky, while others are 
unlucky. In Hong Kong, the numbers 7, 3, and espe￾cially 8 (which sounds like the word for prosperity and 
looks like an infinity symbol) are considered lucky, 
while the number 4 is considered unlucky (because it 
is pronounced like the word death).
Hong Kong businesspeople go to great lengths to 
avoid the number 4. For example, there is no fourth floor 
in office and hotel buildings. Business executives have 
been known to reject ideal sites in heavily congested 
Hong Kong because the address would contain the 
number 4. They pay premium prices for suitable sites 
containing addresses with the lucky numbers. Likewise, 
Hong Kong business managers avoid scheduling impor￾tant events on the fourth day of each month and prefer 
to arrange critical meetings on the eighth day.
Hong Kong is also a place where the ancient art 
of Feng shui (literally “wind water”) is practiced. This 
involves making sure a site and buildings are aligned in 
harmony with the earth’s energy forces so that the loca￾tion will be propitious. Feng shui practitioners are often 
called in on construction projects to make sure that the 
building is aligned correctly on the site. In some cases, 
the technical design of the building is changed to conform 
to the recommendations of such experts. Similarly, Feng 
shui experts have been known to be called in when proj￾ects are experiencing problems. Their recommendations 
may include repositioning the project manager’s desk or 
hanging up mirrors to deflect the flow of unharmonious 
influences away from the building or site of the project.
In cultures where luck is believed to play a role in 
business, people who discount luck may not only insult 
the luck seekers but also risk being thought negligent 
in not paying enough attention to what is viewed as a 
legitimate business concern.

Americans fought a revolution and subsequent wars to preserve their concept of 
democracy, so they resent too much control or interference, especially by governments. 
While more an ideal than practice, there is deep-rooted belief in American management 
philosophy that those people who will be affected by decisions should be involved in 
making decisions. Many foreign businesspeople are surprised at the amount of autonomy 
and decision-making authority granted to subordinates. Foreign personnel have to learn 
to interact with American professionals below their rank in their own organizations.
Businesspeople from other countries are amazed and often somewhat distressed 
at the rapid pace of America. “Getting things done” is an American characteristic. 
Americans are very time-conscious and efficient. They expect meetings to start on 
time. They tinker with gadgets and technological systems, always searching for easier, 
better, more efficient ways of accomplishing things. American professionals are often 
relentless in pursuing project objectives and expect that behavior of others also.
Americans in play or business generally are quite competitive, reflecting their 
desire to achieve and succeed. Although the American culture contains contradictory 
messages about the importance of success (e.g., “It’s not whether you win or lose but 
how you play the game” vs. “nice guys finish last”), winning and being number one 
are clearly valued in American society. Foreigners are often surprised at how aggres￾sively Americans approach business with adversarial attitudes toward competitors and 
a desire to not just meet but exceed project goals and objectives.
The following are some other guidelines and cautions for working with Americans 
on projects.
1. More than half of U.S. women work outside the home; women have consider￾able opportunity for personal and professional growth, guaranteed by law. It is not 
uncommon to find women in key project positions. Female professionals expect 
to be treated as equals. Behavior tolerated in other countries would be subject to 
harassment laws in the States.
2. In the United States, gifts are rarely brought by visitors in a business situation.
3. Americans tend to be quite friendly and open when first meeting someone. Foreigners 
often mistake this strong “come-on” for the beginning of a strong reciprocal friend￾ship. This is in contrast to many other cultures where there is more initial reserve in 
interpersonal relations, especially with strangers. For many foreigners, the American 
comes on too strong too soon, then fails to follow up with the implicitly promised 
friendship.
4. In comparison to the rest of the world Americans tend to be informal in greeting and 
dress, they are a noncontact culture (e.g., they avoid embracing in public usually), 
and they maintain certain physical/psychological distance between themselves and 
others (e.g., about 2 feet) in conversations.
5. American decision making is results oriented. Decisions tend to be based on facts 
and expected outcomes, not social impact.8
Summary Comments about Working in Different Cultures
These briefings underscore the complexity of working on international projects. It is 
common practice to rely on intermediaries—often locals who are foreign educated—to 
bridge the gap between cultures. These intermediaries perform a variety of functions.

They act as translators. They use their social connections to expedite transactions and 
protect the project against undue interference. They are used to sidestep the touchy 
bribery/gift dilemma (see Snapshot from Practice 16.4: Dealing with Customs). They 
serve as cultural guides, helping outsiders understand and interpret the foreign culture. 
A growing number of consulting firms perform these functions by helping foreign 
clients work on projects in their country.
The international briefings also highlight the importance of project managers doing 
their homework and becoming familiar with the customs and habits of the host coun￾try they are going to be working in. As far as possible, the project should be managed 
in such a way that local-country norms and customs are honored. However, there are 
limits to the extent to which you should accommodate foreign cultures. Becoming a 
local is generally not an alternative. After all, it took Russians their entire lives to learn 
how to be Russians. It would be foolish to think an outsider could learn to be one in six 
months, two years, or perhaps ever.
The remainder of this chapter focuses on the selection and training of project per￾sonnel for international projects. But before these issues are discussed, this section 
concludes with a discussion of a phenomenon that can have a profound effect on a 
foreigner’s performance on a project in a strange land.
Culture Shock
Stages of Culture Shock
My first few weeks in Chiang Mai [Thailand] were filled with excitement. I was excited 
about the challenge of building a waste treatment plant in a foreign country. I was fascinated 
with Thai customs and traditions, the smells and sights of the night market. Soon I noticed 
a distinct change in my attitude and behavior. I started having problems sleeping and lacked 
energy. I became irritable at work, frustrated by how long things took to accomplish, and 
how I couldn’t seem to get anything accomplished. I started staying up late at night drinking 
Thai whiskey and watching CNN in my hotel room.
This engineer is experiencing what many would call culture shock, a natural psycho￾logical disorientation that most people suffer when they move into a culture different 
from their own. The culture shock cycle has four stages (see Figure 16.6): 
LO 16-4

and strategies for coping 
with it.
Will corruption influence the project? 
Bribes are illegal in the United States, 
but in some countries, they are the 
usual way to do business. For exam￾ple, one American project manager in 
a foreign country requested that a shipment of critical 
project equipment be sent “overnight rush.” Two days 
later, inquiries to the sender confirmed the materials 
had been delivered to the nearby airport. Further inqui￾ries to the port found the shipment “waiting to pass 
customs.”
Locals quickly informed the American project man￾ager that money paid to the chief customs inspector 
would expedite clearance. The project manager’s 
response was “I will not be held hostage. Bribes are 
illegal!” Two more days of calling government officials 
did not move the shipment from customs.
The manager related his problem to a friendly busi￾nessman of the host nation at a social affair. The local 
businessman said he would see if he could help. The 
shipment arrived the next morning at 10:00 a.m. The 
American called his local business friend and thanked 
him profusely. “I owe you one.” “No,” replied the 
local. “You owe me a $50 dinner when I visit you in 
the States.” The use of an intermediary in such situa￾tions may be the only avenue available to a manager 
to reduce the stress and personal conflict with the U.S. 
value system.

1. Honeymoon. You start your overseas assignment with a sense of excitement. The 
new and the unusual are welcomed. At first, it is amusing not to understand or be 
understood. Soon a sense of frustration begins to set in.
2. Irritability and hostility. Your initial enthusiasm is exhausted, and you begin to 
notice that differences are greater than you first imagined. You become frustrated 
by your inability to get things done as you are accustomed to. You begin to lose 
confidence in your abilities to communicate and work effectively in the different 
culture.
3. Gradual adjustment. You begin to overcome your sense of isolation and figure 
out how to get things done in the new culture. You acquire a new perspective of 
what is possible and regain confidence in your ability to work in the culture.
4. Adaptation. You recover from your sense of psychological disorientation and 
begin to function and communicate in the new culture.
Culture shock is not a disease but a natural response to immersing yourself in a new 
environment. Culture shock results from a breakdown in your selective perception and 
effective interpretation systems. At a subliminal level, your senses are being bom￾barded by a wide variety of strange sounds, sights, and smells. At the same time, the 
normal assumptions you are accustomed to using in your home culture to interpret per￾ceptions and to communicate intentions no longer apply. When this happens, whether 
in a business context or in normal attempts to socialize, confusion and frustration set 
in. The local’s behavior does not seem to make sense, and even more importantly your 
behavior does not produce expected results. Frustration occurs because you are used to 
being competent in such situations and now find you are unable to operate effectively.
Culture shock is generally considered a positive sign that the professional is becom￾ing involved in the new culture instead of remaining isolated in expatriate seclusion. 
The significant question is how best to manage culture shock, not how to avoid it. The 
key appears to be managing the stress associated with culture shock.
Stress-related culture shock takes many forms: disappointment, frustration, with￾drawal, anxiety, and physiological responses such as fatigue, sleeplessness, and head￾aches. Stress is induced by the senses being overwhelmed by foreign stimuli and the 
inability to function effectively in a strange land. Stress is exacerbated when one 
encounters disturbing situations that, as a foreigner, are neither understood nor con￾doned. For example, many North Americans are appalled by the poverty and hunger in 
many underdeveloped countries.

Coping with Culture Shock
There are a wide range of stress management techniques for coping with culture shock. 
One method does not necessarily work any better than another; success depends on the 
particular individual and situation involved. Some people engage in regular physical 
exercise programs, some practice meditation and relaxation exercises, and others find 
it healthy to keep a journal.
Many effective international managers create “stability zones.” They spend most of 
their time immersed in the foreign culture but then briefly retreat into an environment—
a stability zone—that closely re-creates home. For example, when one of the authors 
was living in Kraków, Poland, with his family, they routinely went to the Polish movie 
houses to see American movies with Polish subtitles. The two hours spent hearing Eng￾lish and seeing a familiar environment on the screen had a soothing effect on everyone.
On the project, managers can reduce the stress caused by culture shock by recogniz￾ing it and modifying their expectations and behavior accordingly. They can redefine 
priorities and develop more realistic expectations as to what is possible. They can focus 
their limited energy on only the most important tasks and relish small accomplishments.
After three to six months, depending on the individual and assignment, most people 
overcome their culture shock “low” and begin living a more normal life in the foreign 
country. They talk to acquaintances from the host country and experienced outsiders 
from their own culture to find out how to behave and what to expect. Little by little they 
learn how to make sense of the new environment. They figure out when “yes” means 
“yes” and when it means “maybe” and when it means “no.” See Snapshot from Practice 
16.5: Project X—Namibia, Africa, for further insights into coping with culture shock.
While U.S. reality TV shows focus on find￾ing love, outwitting opponents, and gar￾nering audience support, a Norwegian 
TV show shone a light on project man￾agement under extreme conditions. The 
plot was deceptively simple: send 10 Scandinavian volun￾teers 6,000 miles away from home to the dry subtropics 
of southern Africa and charge them with building a school 
for orphans and poor children in less than 30 days. Not 
only would they be forced to adjust to vastly different lan￾guages, climates, and cuisines, but only one of the 10 had 
previous construction experience. The team’s trials and 
tribulations were aired over Norwegian TV in 2009. The 
marketing blitz for the show, titled Project X, played up the 
drama with the tagline “Can they achieve the mission?”
The team was enthusiastic at the outset, but discontent 
began as soon as they arrived at the small mining town of 
Tsumeb in Namibia. The team immediately experienced 
culture shock—all the while the TV crew followed them, 
sticking cameras in their faces and asking how they felt.
The sweltering heat, slumlike conditions, and lim￾ited cuisine immediately elicited complaints: “I can’t 
sleep.” “The food is awful.” “Where are the toilets?”
One of the biggest mistakes the volunteers made 
was applying a Eurocentric sense of time and planning. 
“I brought my Danish mindset that ‘On Friday we will do 
this and on Saturday we will do that,’” reported Merete 
Lange, one of the volunteers. “Then I came to under￾stand African time, and that was the biggest surprise.”
Hoping to secure local buy-in, Lange arranged for 
a local carpenter to build desks and tables. A few days 
before the furniture was needed, she discovered work 
hadn’t even begun.
“I got pretty stressed and tried to be my best at 
being diplomatic,” Lange recalls. “I asked, ‘When do 
you think you will be ready with the furniture?’” The 
carpenter responded, “Time is unpredictable. I will call 
you.”
Over time, Lange and her teammates were able to 
adapt to the elements and figure out ways to work with 
the locals to successfully build the school within 30 
days. “The trick is reflecting upon ‘where people were 
coming from, how to meet them there, and how to cre￾ate a win-win situation that would satisfy both parties.’”

The vast majority of people eventually make the adjustment, although for some 
people it can take much longer than three to six months. A smaller number never 
recover, and their international experience turns into a nightmare. Some exhibit severe 
stress symptoms (e.g., substance abuse, panic attacks) and must return home before 
finishing their assignment.
Professionals can use project work as a bridge until they adjust to their new envi￾ronment. Unfortunately, partners who do not work do not have this advantage. When 
partners are left to cope with the strange environment on their own, they often have a 
much more difficult time overcoming culture shock. The effect on partners cannot be 
underestimated. The number one reason expatriate managers return home is that their 
partners fail to adjust to the new environment (Tung, 1987).
Project professionals working overseas accept that they are in a difficult situation 
and that they will not act as effectively as they did at home, especially in the initial 
stages. They recognize the need for good stress management techniques, including 
stability zones. They also recognize that it is not an individual problem and invest 
extra time and energy to help their spouses and families manage the transition. At the 
same time, they appreciate that their colleagues are experiencing similar problems and 
are sensitive to their needs. They work together to manage the stress and pull out of a 
culture shock low as quickly as possible.
It is somewhat ironic, but people who work on projects overseas experience cul￾ture shock twice. Many professionals experience the same kind of disorientation and 
stress when they return home, although it is usually less severe. For some, their cur￾rent job has less responsibility and is boring compared with the challenge of their 
overseas assignment. Others have problems adjusting to changes made in the home 
organization while they were gone. This can be compounded by financial shock when 
the salary and fringe benefits they became accustomed to in the foreign assignment 
are now lost, and adjusting to a lower standard of living is difficult. It typically takes 
six months to a year before managers operate again at full effectiveness after a lengthy 
foreign assignment (Adler & Gunderson, 2007).
16.4 Selection and Training for International Projects
When professionals are selected for overseas projects and they do not work out, the 
overall costs can be staggering. Not only does the project experience a serious setback, 
but the reputation of the firm is damaged in the region. This is why many firms have 
developed formal screening procedures to help ensure the careful selection of person￾nel for international projects. Organizations examine a number of characteristics to 
determine whether an individual is suitable for overseas work. They may look for work 
experience with cultures other than one’s own, previous overseas travel, good physi￾cal and emotional health, a knowledge of a host nation’s language, and even recent 
immigration background or heritage. Prospective candidates and their family members 
are often interviewed by trained psychologists, who assess their ability to adapt and 
function in the new culture.
While there is growing appreciation for screening people for foreign assignments, 
the number one reason for selection is that the personnel assigned are the best people 
available for the technical challenges of the project (Mendenhall, Dunbar, & Oddou, 
1987). Technical know-how takes precedence over cross-cultural sensitivity or expe￾rience. As a consequence, training is critical to fill in the cultural gaps and prepare 
individuals to work in a foreign land.

Training varies widely, depending on the individual, company, nature of the project, 
and cultures to work with. Project professionals assigned to foreign countries should 
have a minimal understanding of the following areas:
∙ Religion.
∙ Dress codes.
∙ Education system.
∙ Holidays—national and religious.
∙ Daily eating patterns.
∙ Family life.
∙ Business protocols.
∙ Social etiquette.
∙ Equal opportunity.
An example of a short-term training program is the one developed by Underwriter 
Laboratories, Inc., to train staff who travel to Japan to work with clients on projects. 
The program is designed around a series of mini-lectures that cover topics ranging 
from how to handle introductions to the correct way of interpreting Japanese social 
and business behavior. The two-day program consists of lectures, case studies, role￾plays, language practice, and a short test on cultural terminology; it concludes with a 
90-minute question-and-answer period. At the end of the program, participants have 
a fundamental understanding of how to communicate with people from Japan. More 
importantly, they know the types of information they lack and how to go about learn￾ing more to become effective intercultural communicators.
Other training programs are more extensive. For example, Peace Corps volunteers 
undergo an intense two- to four-month training program in their country of service. 
The training includes classes on the history and traditions of the country, intensive lan￾guage instruction, and cross-cultural training as well as homestays with local families. 
Many companies outsource training to one of the many firms specializing in overseas 
and intercultural training.
Figure 16.7 attempts to link the length and type of training with the cultural fluency 
required to successfully complete the project. Three different learning approaches are 
highlighted (Mendenhall et al., 1987):
1. The “information-giving” approach—the learning of information or skills from a 
lecture-type orientation.
2. The “affective” approach—the learning of information/skills that raise the affective 
responses on the part of the trainee and result in cultural insights.
3. The “experiential” approach—a variant of the affective approach technique that 
provides the trainee with realistic simulations or scenarios.
According to this framework, the length and level of training depend on the 
degree of cultural fluency required to be successful. In general, the longer the person 
is expected to work in a foreign country, the more intensive the training should be. 
Length of stay should not be the only consideration; high levels of cultural fluency, 
and therefore more extensive training, may be required to perform short-term, intense 
projects. In addition, location is important. Americans working in Australia will likely 
require less cultural fluency than those working on a project in Pakistan.
While English is rapidly becoming the international language for business in many 
parts of the world, you should not underestimate the value of being able to speak the

Summary The number of international projects continues to increase. More and more project 
managers will be needed to implement international projects. Preparing for interna￾tional projects can be enhanced through training. As a general background, potential 
international project managers can benefit from a basic international business course 
that sensitizes them to the forces of change in the global economy and to cultural dif￾ferences. Learning a foreign language is also strongly recommended.

language of the host country. At a minimum, you should be able to exchange basic 
pleasantries in the native tongue. Most foreigners consider this a sign of respect, and 
even if you stumble they appreciate the effort.
In many situations, translators are used to facilitate communication. While time￾consuming, this is the only way to communicate with non-English-speaking personnel. 
Be careful in the selection of translators, and do not just assume they are competent. 
For example, one of the authors enlisted the help of a Polish translator to conduct 
a meeting with some Polish managers. After the meeting the translator, who taught 
English at a local university, asked if the author “had good time.” I responded that I 
felt things went well. The translator repeated her question. Puzzled, I reaffirmed that 
I felt things went well. After the interchange was repeated several times, the translator 
finally grabbed my wrist, pointed at my watch, and asked again if I “had good time.” 
Doubts arose concerning the accuracy of the meeting translation!

Further training specific to the host country is a very useful pre-project endeavor. 
The length and type of training usually depend on the duration of the project man￾ager’s assignment. Still, self-learning, on-the-job training, and experience are the best 
teachers for international project managers.
Preparing for a specific international project requires serious pre-project home￾work. Understanding the firm’s motivation in selecting the project and its site provides 
important insights. What basic political, geographic, economic, and infrastructure fac￾tors were key considerations? How will they impact the implementation of the project?
Finally, preparation and understanding the cultural differences of the host coun￾try go a long way toward making positive first impressions with the nationals and 
managing the project. International projects have distinct personalities. All people are 
not the same. Differences within and among countries and cultures are numerous and 
complex. Project managers need to accept these differences and treat them as real—or 
live with the consequences. What works at home may not work in the foreign country. 
Americans are regarded as friendly in the global village, but Americans are also noted 
to be insensitive to differences in local cultures and customs and awkward in our use 
of languages other than English. Although most attention in foreign projects is focused 
on technical efforts and their cost, the project must be carried out within the environ￾ment of the country’s social customs, work practices, government controls, and reli￾gious beliefs. In most cultures, sincerity and flexibility will pay off.

Case 16.1
AMEX, Hungary
Michael Thomas shouted, “Sasha, Tor-Tor, we’ve got to go! Our driver is waiting 
for us.” Thomas’s two daughters were fighting over who would get the last orange 
for lunch that day. Victoria (“Tor-Tor”) prevailed as she grabbed the orange and ran 
out the door to the Mercedes Benz waiting for them. The fighting continued in the 
back seat as they drove toward the city of Budapest, Hungary. Thomas finally turned 
around, grabbed the orange, and proclaimed that he would have it for lunch. The back 
seat became deadly silent as they made their way to the American International School 
of Budapest.
After dropping the girls off at the school, Thomas was driven to his office in the 
Belvéros area of Budapest. Thomas worked for AMEX Petroleum and had been sent 
to Budapest four months earlier to set up business operations in central Hungary. His 
job was to establish 10 to 14 gas stations in the region by purchasing existing stations, 
building new ones, or negotiating franchise arrangements with existing owners of sta￾tions. Thomas jumped at this project. He realized that his career at AMEX was going 
nowhere in the United States, and if he were going to realize his ambitions, it would 
be in the “wild, wild east” of the former Soviet empire. Besides, Thomas’s mother 
was Hungarian, and he could speak the language. At least he thought he could until 
he arrived in Budapest and realized that he had greatly exaggerated his competence.
As he entered the partially refurbished offices of AMEX, he noticed that only three 
of his staff were present. No one knew where Miklos was, while Margit reported that 
she would not be at work today because she had to stay at home to take care of her sick 
mother. Thomas asked Béla why the workmen weren’t present to work on finishing the 
office. Béla informed him that the work had to be halted until they received approval 
from the city historian. Budapest, anxious to preserve its historical heritage, required 
that all building renovations be approved by the city historian. When Thomas asked 
Béla how long it would take, Béla responded, “Who knows—days, weeks, maybe even 
months.” Thomas muttered “great” to himself and turned his attention to the morning 
business. He was scheduled to interview prospective employees who would act as sta￾tion managers and staff personnel.
The interview with Ferenc Erkel was typical of the many interviews he held that 
morning. Erkel was a neatly dressed, 42-year-old, unemployed professional who could 
speak limited English. He had a master’s degree in international economics and had 
worked for 12 years in the state-owned Institute for Foreign Trade. Since being laid off 
two years ago, he had been working as a taxicab driver. When asked about his work at

lar60886_ch16_601-636.indd 633 10/14/23 12:04 pm
the institute, Erkel smiled sheepishly and said that he pushed paper and spent most of 
the time playing cards with his colleagues.
To date, Thomas had hired 16 employees. Four quit within three days on the job, 
and six were let go after a trial period for being absent from work, failing to perform 
duties, or showing a lack of initiative. Thomas thought that at this rate it would take 
him over a year just to hire his staff.
Thomas took a break from the interview schedule to scan the Budapest Business 
Journal, an English newspaper that covered business news in Hungary. Two items 
caught his eye. One article was on the growing threat of the Ukrainian Mafia in Hun￾gary, which detailed extortion attempts in Budapest. The second story was that infla￾tion had risen to 32 percent. This last item disturbed Thomas because at the time only 
one out of every five Hungarian families owned a car. AMEX’s strategy in Hungary 
depended on a boom in first-time car owners.
Thomas collected his things and popped a few aspirin for the headache he was 
developing. He walked several blocks to the Kispipa restaurant, where he had a supper 
meeting with Hungarian businessman Zoltán Kodaly. He had met Kodaly briefly at 
a reception sponsored by the U.S. consulate for American and Hungarian business￾people. Kodaly reportedly owned three gas stations that Thomas was interested in.
Thomas waited, sipping bottled water, for 25 minutes. Kodaly appeared with 
a young lady who could not have been older than 19. As it turned out Kodaly had 
brought his daughter Annia, who was a university student, to act as translator. While 
Thomas made an attempt to speak in Hungarian at first, Kodaly insisted that they use 
Annia to translate.
After ordering the house specialty, szekelygulas, Thomas immediately got down 
to business. He told Kodaly that AMEX was willing to make two offers to him. 
They would like to purchase two of his stations at a price of $150,000 each, or they 
could work out a franchise agreement. Thomas said AMEX was not interested in the 
third station located near Klinikak because it would be too expensive to modernize 
the equipment. Annia translated, and as far as Thomas could tell she was doing a 
pretty good job. At first, Kodaly did not respond and simply engaged in side con￾versations with Annia and exchanged pleasantries with people who went by. Thomas 
became frustrated and reiterated his offer. Eventually, Kodaly asked what he meant by 
franchising, and Thomas tried to use the local McDonald’s as an example of how it 
worked. He mentioned that Kodaly would still own the stations, but he would have to 
pay a franchisee fee, share profits with AMEX, and adhere to AMEX procedures and 
practices. In exchange, AMEX would provide petroleum and funds to renovate the sta￾tions to meet AMEX standards.
Toward the end of the meal, Kodaly asked what would happen to the people who 
worked at the stations. Thomas asserted that according to his calculation, the stations 
were overstaffed by 70 percent and that to make a profit at least 15 workers would have 
to be let go. This statement was greeted with silence. Kodaly then turned the conversa￾tion to soccer and asked Thomas if it was true that in America girls play “football.” 
Thomas said that both of his daughters played AYSO soccer in America and hoped to 
play in Hungary. Kodaly said girls don’t play football in Hungary and that Annia was 
an accomplished volleyball player. Thomas pressed Kodaly for a response to his offer, 
but Kodaly rose and thanked Thomas for the meal. He said he would think about his 
offer and get back in touch with him.
Thomas left the Kispipa restaurant wondering if he would ever see Kodaly again. 
He returned to his office, where an urgent message was waiting from Tibor. Tibor 
was responsible for retrofitting the first station Thomas had purchased for AMEX.

The new tanks had not arrived from Vienna, and the construction crew had spent the 
day doing nothing. After several phone calls, he found out that the tanks were being 
held at the border by customs. This irritated him because he had been assured by local 
officials that everything had been taken care of. He asked his secretary to schedule an 
appointment with the Hungarian trade office as soon as possible.
At the end of the day, he checked his e-mail from the States. There was a message 
from headquarters asking about the status of the project. By this time he had hoped to 
have his office staffed and up and running and at least three stations secured. So far 
he had only one-third of his staff, his office was in shambles, and only one station was 
being retrofitted. Thomas decided to wait until tomorrow to respond to the e-mail.
Before returning home Thomas stopped off at the English Pub, a favorite hangout 
for expats in Budapest. There he met Jan Krovert, who worked for a Dutch company 
that was building a large discount retail store on the outskirts of Budapest. Thomas 
and Krovert often talked about being “strangers in a strange land” at the pub. Thomas 
talked about the interviews and how he could just see in their eyes that they didn’t 
have the drive or initiative to be successful. Krovert responded that Hungary has high 
unemployment but a shortage of motivated workers. Krovert confided that he no lon￾ger interviewed anyone over the age of 30, claiming that what fire they had in their 
bellies was burned out after years of working in state-run companies.
1. What are the issues confronting Thomas in this case?
2. How well is Thomas dealing with these issues?
3. What suggestions would you have for Thomas in managing this project?
Case 16.2
Phuket A
On December 26, 2004, an earthquake reaching 9.1 on the Richter scale triggered a 
series of devastating tsunamis off the coast of Indonesia. They spread throughout the 
Indian Ocean, killing large numbers of people and inundating coastal communities 
across South and Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and 
Thailand. The 2004 tsunami was one of the deadliest catastrophes in modern history, 
with more than 220,000 lives lost.
Nils Lofgrin, who had managed several construction projects in Australia and 
New Guinea, was sent by his construction firm to restore a five-star resort along the 
Andaman coast in southern Thailand that had been ravaged by this tsunami. Casual￾ties at the resort included 12 staff and 37 guests. This was Nils’s first assignment in 
Thailand.
Nils flew down and toured the site. His assessment of the damage was that it was 
not as severe as feared. The basic infrastructure was intact but debris needed to be 
cleared and the resort refurbished. He reported back to headquarters that with a bit of 
luck he should have the resort up and running in a matter of months. Little did he real￾ize how soon he would regret making such a promise.
The problems began immediately when he was unable to recruit workers to clean 
up the mess at the resort. Burmese migrant workers made up a significant portion of 
the workforce in the region. The heavy government presence after the tsunami caused 
them to flee into the hills out of growing fears of being arrested and deported. Still, 
Final PDF to printerChapter 16 International Projects 635
lar60886_ch16_601-636.indd 635 10/14/23 12:04 pm
there was an ample number of locals available to do the work. Repeated efforts to 
recruit laborers failed. Even when he offered double wages he was only able to recruit 
a few Thai people.
1. Why do you think Nils is unable to recruit Thai workers for his project?
Case 16.3
Mr. Wui Goes to America
Wui arrived in Mobile, Alabama, in the middle of summer, unprepared for humidity 
and heat. The first day he bought a lightweight, breathable business suit. He was helped 
by salespeople who smiled as they packed the coat and slacks into a box. Americans 
are nice, Wui decided. He was not worried about his assignment in America. The 
contract had been negotiated. Wui’s job was to work out the details and establish com￾munication protocols.
Wui’s firm, DSD, was one of the biggest construction firms in China. Wui was 
assigned to the Shenzhen Green project, a state-of-the-art, 30-story office building. 
Wui was sent to Mobile because that is where Katsam Industries had its new electro￾chromic glass fabrication factory. The factory was producing next-generation glass 
products, which dramatically improved energy efficiency and occupant comfort. Kat￾sam’s global experience was limited, but it had a reputation for being innovative.
When Wui woke up he called Jon Bigelow at Katsam to confirm his 10:00 a.m. 
meeting. Bigelow’s assistant verified the meeting.
Wui arrived at the Katsam office at 10 a.m. sharp. He had brought a pair of sitting 
foo dogs for Bigelow. The statues were carved from special stone found only near 
his parent’s village. They are cherished by the Chinese for their ability to ward off 
evil spirits. He would explain the significance to Bigelow later when they knew each 
other.
When Bigelow’s assistant ushered him in, Bigelow stood up immediately and 
rounded his desk with an outstretched hand. Squeezing Wui’s hand, he roared, “How 
are you? Long trip from Hong Kong? Please sit down, please sit down.”
Wui smiled and reached into his jacket for his card. By the time he had presented 
it, Bigelow was on the other side of his desk. “My card,” Wui said with a slight bow.
“Yes, yes,” Bigelow answered. He put Wui’s card in his pocket without a glance.
Wui stared at the floor.
“Here,” Bigelow handed his card.
“Oh, Jon Bigelow, Director of Operations, Katsam Industries, Mobile, Alabama,” 
Wui read out loud while holding the card with both hands. “Katsam has an excellent 
reputation in China.”
“That’s me,” Bigelow replied. “Pleased to meet you, Wui; I think we will work very 
well together; won’t you sit down?”
Wui smiled and laid Bigelow’s card on the table in front of him.
“DSD is pleased to do business with Katsam,” Wui spoke slowly. Wui was proud of 
his English. Not only had he been the top student in his high school and university, but 
he had also studied business English in evening courses for four years.
Bigelow looked impatient. Wui continued to talk about DSD and Katsam history. 
“We are the best in the business,” Bigelow interrupted. “Ask anyone in the industry, 
our glass is the best in the world!”
Final PDF to printer636 Chapter 16 International Projects
lar60886_ch16_601-636.indd 636 10/14/23 12:04 pm
Wui didn’t know what to say. He knew Katsam’s record—that was why he was in 
the room. Surely Bigelow knew that. His foot touched the box containing the foo dog 
statues. Maybe he should give the gift now. No, he thought. Bigelow was still talking 
about Katsam’s achievements. Now Bigelow had switched to his own achievements. 
“You have to come over to my house. It’s a totally renovated 200-year-old colonial 
mansion with a fantastic view of the bay. You know, I have the greatest wife. She is a 
superb cook. You come to our house and she’ll give you a real taste of Southern cook￾ing: grits, gumbo, sweet tea, you name it.”
Wui shifted his weight and said, “Thank you, I would enjoy that very much.” He 
then reached down and picked up the box. “I brought you a present,” Wui said, hand￾ing him the box containing the foo dogs.
“Thanks,” Bigelow answered. He looked genuinely pleased as he tore open the 
paper and opened the box. Wui looked away while Bigelow picked up a foo dog in 
each hand and said, “Hey, thanks a lot, I will give one to each of my kids.”
Bigelow pushed the statues aside and said, “Give me a second, Wui; I need to send 
a message to my assistant.”
They spent the next hour going over Wui’s visit and answering questions about the 
work Katsam was going to do for DSD. The discussion was interrupted by a tap on 
the door. Bigelow jumped up and said, “It must be lunchtime!” Bigelow’s assistant 
entered the office caring a brightly colored package. When she handed the package 
to Wui, Bigelow announced, “Katsam has a present for you.” Wui nodded thanks and 
waited. Bigelow cried, “Aren’t you going to open it? I think you are really going to like 
it. Go ahead, open it.”
Wui reluctantly opened the package. He pulled out of the box a light grey shirt 
with “Atlanta Braves” spelled out on the front and a picture of what appeared to be a 
tomahawk. On the back was printed the name Aaron and, in big numerals, 44. Bigelow 
proudly proclaimed, “We heard you guys like baseball, so we thought it would be only 
fitting to give you a replica of the greatest baseball player to ever come out of Mobile, 
Alabama, good ole #44, Hammering Hank Aaron.” He patted Wui on the back and 
said, “Now let’s go get some food!”
1. How do you think Wui feels about working with Bigelow so far?
2. What mistakes did Wui make?
3. What mistakes did Bigelow make?
4. How could these mistakes have been prevented?

Project duration is reduced from 13 time periods to 10 time periods. Total direct cost 
goes up from $1,000 to $1,240. The steps are shown below:
A B C F Duration: 13
2x 3 6 1x 12

The project has two paths, A-B-C-F, which takes 12 time periods, and A-B-D-E-F, 
which takes 13 time periods. This gives the project a duration of 13 time periods. The 
total direct cost is $1,000.

The cheapest activity to reduce is D at a cost of $40 for one time period. That makes 
both paths critical. This means that further reductions will require either reducing the 
same time from an activity on both paths or finding an activity shared by both paths 
and reducing that activity. Total direct cost goes up from $1,000 to $1,040.

Activity B is on both paths and can be reduced by one time period at a cost of $100.1
That lowers the completion time to 11 time periods and raises total direct cost to $1,140.
1 Activities C on the first path and E on the second path also have a combined cost of $100. We select B first since it is 
usually smarter to crash earlier activities first and it is usually smarter to crash one activity rather than two activities.

APPENDIX TWO
Computer Project 
Exercises
In developing the exercises, trade-offs had to be made to enrich the learning experience. 
One of the major problems students initially encounter is data and detail overload. This 
reduces their ability to identify project and data problems and to compare alternatives. 
Although the project found in the exercises is real, it has been reduced and detail has 
been eliminated many times to concentrate on applying project management principles 
and understanding linkages. In addition, other simplifying assumptions have been made 
so that students and instructors can trace problems and discuss outcomes. These assump￾tions detract from reality, but they keep the focus on the objectives of the exercises and 
reduce student frustration with software intricacies. Moving from these exercises to real 
projects is primarily one of increasing detail.
The POM+ Project
Big Kola Company has been concerned that specialized fruit drinks have been eroding 
their cola market. The CEO mandates that “If you can’t beat them, join them.” Grape 
juice was the first product that was successful after an advertising blitz claiming the 
antitoxin benefits. Lately, competition is compressing grape juice margins and profits. 
Months of additional market surveys and focus groups have resulted in three potential 
high-margin drinks: cranberry, blueberry, and pomegranate. All these choices repre￾sent antitoxins. The decision is to produce the pomegranate drink that has many health 
claims. For example, the relative ability of these juices to eliminate harmful free radi￾cals (antitoxins) is 71 percent for pomegranate, 33 percent for blueberry, and 20 percent 
for cranberry (Technion Institute of Technology). The market potential appears very 
attractive and should have a higher profit margin than the other potential juice products. 
Another appeal for pomegranate juice is its familiarity in the Middle East and Asia.

Remember the old saying, “A project plan is not a schedule until resources are com￾mitted.” This exercise illustrates this sometime subtle, but important point.
Using your files from Part 1, input resources and their costs if you have not already 
done so. All information is found in Tables A2.1 and A2.2.
Prepare a memo that addresses the following questions:
1. Which if any of the resources are overallocated?
2. Assume that the project is time constrained and try to resolve any overallocation 
problems by leveling within slack. What happens?

Part A
Prepare a memo that addresses the following questions:
1. Which if any of the resources are overallocated?
2. Assume that the project is time constrained and try to resolve any overallocation 
problems by leveling within slack. What happens?
3. What is the impact of leveling within slack on the sensitivity of the network?
Include a Gantt chart with the schedule table after leveling within slack.
4. Assume that the project is resource constrained and no additional personnel are 
available. How long will the project take given the resources assigned? (Hint: Undo 
leveling performed in Part A before answering this question.)
Note: No splitting of activities is allowed.

5. How does the new duration compare with the estimated completion date gener￾ated from Part 1? What does this tell you about the impact resources can have on a 
schedule?
Include a Gantt chart with a schedule table displaying free and total slack depicting the 
resource-constrained schedule.
Part B
Top management is not happy with the resource-constrained schedule. Robin Lane, 
the president, has promised retailers that ARC will begin production in time for the 
major trade show in Las Vegas on January 22, 2016, which means the project needs 
to be completed by January 17, 2016. She has authorized working the first available 
Saturday of each month to help the project get completed sooner. She realizes that this 
will only reduce the project duration by 12–13 days.
After talking to the engineers, everyone agrees that they do not have to wait for the 
Detailed Product Design to be 100% completed before starting to build the prototype. 
The consensus is that Building the Prototype can start 30 days after the start of the 
Detailed Product Design. Likewise, the Final Manufacturing Process can start 15 days 
after the start of Finalized Product Design.
Dewey Martin, director of product development, is also willing to add personnel to 
the project. He is willing to make available at least one more Development, Design, 
and/or Industrial Engineer to the project as well as Marketing Specialist. Since there is

an acute shortage of personnel at ARC he requests that you only use additional man￾power that will help meet the deadline. Your objective is to develop a schedule that 
will satisfy the deadline with minimum additional resource usage.
Prepare a memo that addresses the following questions:
1. What was the impact of introducing Start-to-Start lags to the schedule and budget?
2. Which, if any additional personnel assignments, would you choose to complete the 
project before the January 17th deadline? Explain your choices as well as the rea￾sons for not choosing other options.
3. How have these changes affected the sensitivity of the network and the critical path?
Include a Gantt chart with a schedule table displaying free and total slack for the 
new schedule.
Note: Do not assign new personnel to specific tasks, simply add them to the Resource 
Sheet. All new personnel are available full time (100%).
Part 3
Top management has accepted the schedule created at the end of Part 2. Prepare a 
brief memo that addresses the following questions:
1. How much will the project cost? What is the most expensive activity?
2. What does the cash flow statement tell you about how costs are distributed over the 
life span of the project?
Include a monthly cash flow for the project.
Once you are confident that you have the final schedule, save the file as a baseline.
Hint: Save a backup file just in case without baseline!

Part A
Today’s date is July 8, 2015, the milestone date for the completion of the Prototype. 
You are charged with preparing a status report for top management. Table A2.8 sum￾marizes progress on the Red Zuma project.
Submit a professional status report to Robin Lane that addresses the following questions:
1. How is the project progressing in terms of cost and schedule?
2. What activities have gone well? What activities have not gone well?
3. How much of the project has been accomplished (PCIB)?
4. What is the forecasted cost at completion (EACf
)?
5. What is the estimated completion date?
6. How is the project doing in terms of priorities (see Part 1)?
Report and interpret relevant Earned Value metrics in your report.
Include a Tracking Gantt chart as well as an Earned Value Table with your memo.

Part B
You have told Robin Lane that based on what you know now you need to revise the 
estimates for some of the remaining activities. Finalized Product Design is expected 
to take 3 days longer than planned. Final Manufacturing Process is expected to take 
2 days less than planned, while Install Production Equipment is now expected to take 
only 30 days. You also report that Detailed Marketing plan will be completed before 
the end of the New Year. She is insisting that the project be completed by January 
17th in order to be ready for the Las Vegas show. She is willing to spend $50,000 from 
Management Reserves to expedite shipping if necessary. $25,000 would reduce the 
shipping of components by 5 days and/or $25,000 would reduce the shipping of manu￾facturing parts by 5 days. (Hint: Adjust lag.) Prepare a memo to Robin that addresses 
the following questions:
1. What is the impact of the revised estimates for Finalized Product Design and Install 
Production Equipment on the project schedule and cost?
2. Would you recommend authorizing the expenditure of $50,000? Explain.
3. What, if any other recommendations, would you make so that the project can 
achieve Robin’s deadline? Justify your recommendations.
Include a Tracking Gantt chart with variance schedule that depicts your final rec￾ommendations and revised schedule.
Hint: After adjusting the Installation of Production Equipment and Finalized 
Product Design, level outside of slack to eliminate any resource over allocation 
problems.

Conveyor Belt Project
Part 1
Project Description
The new computer-controlled conveyor belt is an exciting project that moves and positions 
items on the conveyor belt within <1 millimeter. The project will produce a new system for 
future installations, and for replacement of those in the field, at a low cost. The computer￾controlled conveyor belt has the potential to be a critical unit in 30 percent of the systems 
installed in factories. The new system is also easier to update with future technologies.
The Project Priority Matrix for the Conveyor Belt Project (CBP) is:

Include the following printouts:
∙ A Gantt chart.
∙ A network diagram highlighting the critical path.
∙ A schedule table reporting ES, LS, EF, LF, and slack for each activity.
Hint: The project should be completed in 530 days.
Remember: Save your file for future exercises!
Part 3
Remember the old saying, “A project plan is not a schedule until resources are com￾mitted.” This exercise illustrates this subtle, but very important, difference.
Part A
Using your files from Part 2 input resources and their costs if you have not already 
done so. All information is found in Tables A2.10 and A2.11.
Prepare a memo that addresses the following questions:
1. Which if any of the resources are overallocated?
2. Assume that the project is time constrained and try to resolve any overallocation 
problems by leveling within slack. What happens?
3. What is the impact of leveling within slack on the sensitivity of the network?
Include a Gantt chart with the schedule table after leveling within slack.
4. Assume the project is resource constrained and resolve any overallocation problems 
by leveling outside of slack. What happens? What are the managerial implications?
5. What options are available at this point in time?
Include a Gantt chart with the schedule table after leveling outside of slack.
Note: No splitting of activities is allowed.
Note: No partial assignments (e.g., 50 percent). All resources must be assigned 
100 percent.
Part B
When you show the resource-constrained network to top management, they are visibly 
shaken. After some explanation and negotiation they make the following compromise 
with you:
∙ The project must be completed no later than February 1, 2028 (530 days).
∙ You may assign two additional development teams.
∙ If this does not suffice, you may hire other development teams from the outside. 
Hire as few external teams as possible because they cost $50 more per hour than 
your inside development people.
Name Group Cost ($/hr)
Design R&D (2 teams) $100
Development R&D (2 teams) 70
Documentation R&D (1 team) 60
Assembly/test R&D (1 team) 70
Purchasing Procurement (1 team) 40

Internal Development
Add as many development units (teams) as needed to stay within the 530 days. If you 
need more than two internal development units, then hire as few external teams as 
necessary. Select the cheapest possibility! Change as few activities as possible. It is 
recommended you keep work packages that require cooperation of several organiza￾tional units inside your company. You decide how best to do this.
Hint: Undo leveling prior to adding new resources.
Once you have obtained a schedule that meets the time and resource constraints, 
prepare a memo that addresses the following questions:
1. What changes did you make and why?
2. How long will the project take?
3. How did these changes affect the sensitivity of the network?
Include a Gantt chart with a schedule table presenting the new schedule.
Part 4
Based on the file created at the end of Part 3, prepare a memo that addresses the fol￾lowing questions:
1. How much will the project cost?
2. What does the cash flow statement tell you about how costs are distributed over the 
life span of the project?
Include a monthly cash flow and a cost table for the project.
Once you are confident that you have the final schedule, save the file as a 
baseline.
Hint: Save a backup file just in case without baseline!
Part 5
Prepare status reports for each of the first four quarters of the project, given the infor￾mation provided here. This requires saving your resource schedule as a baseline and 
inserting the appropriate status report date in the program. Assume that no work has 
been completed on the day of the status report.
Your status report should include a table containing the PV, EV, AC, BAC, EAC, 
SV, CV, and CPI for each activity and the whole project. The report should also address 
the following questions:
1. How is the project progressing in terms of cost and schedule?
2. What activities have gone well? What activities have not gone well?
3. What do the PCIB and PCIC indicate in terms of how much of the project has been 
accomplished to date?
4. What is the forecasted cost at completion (EACf
)? What is the predicted VACf
?
5. Report and interpret the TCPI for the project at this point in time.
6. What is the estimated date of completion?
7. How well is the project doing in terms of its priorities?
Try to present the above information in a form worthy of consideration by top 
management.
Include a Tracking Gantt chart with each report.
